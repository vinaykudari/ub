# 1. Only add your code inside the function (including newly improted packages). 
#  You can design a new function and call the new function in the given functions. 
# 2. For bonus: Give your own picturs. If you have N pictures, name your pictures such as ["t3_1.png", "t3_2.png", ..., "t3_N.png"], and put them inside the folder "images".
# 3. Not following the project guidelines will result in a 10% reduction in grades
