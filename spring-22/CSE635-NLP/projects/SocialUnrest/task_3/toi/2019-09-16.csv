1,Sikh votes to be decisive in J&K polls,"PATAN, Kashmir: The 12,000 Sikh votes will play a crucial role in the Baramulla constituency where the largest number of contestants (13) are in the fray in the first phase of the polls on Monday.

â€˜â€˜Our votes will be crucial for two reasons: First, because Sikhs have been voting en block here, and secondly, because the voter turnout is expected to be low. If the latter happens, then the Sikh votes will decide the winner,â€™â€™ said president of the Shiromani Akali Dal, Kashmir, Janak Singh Sodhi.

Asked if the Sikh community is prepared to vote, another Sikh resident of Baramulla, Shivdev Singh, said, â€˜â€˜It depends on the majority community here. If the majority community (Kashmiri Muslims) casts its votes, we shall also do so. The fear factor introduced by the terrorist threats is keeping us undecided. But we shall definitely vote, even if one member of the majority (Muslim) community votes.â€™â€™

Another Sikh resident, who refused to identify himself, said, â€˜â€˜We will certainly vote if a good number of our neighbours do so.â€™â€™

According to him, the Sikh community, comprising 40,000 people all over the Valley, some of them in business but mostly in service, â€˜â€˜is still fearful of the Chittisingpora incidentâ€™â€™ in which over 30 residents belonging to this community were gunned down, the year the then US President Bill Clinton was visiting India.

He then added, â€˜â€˜Our presence reassures everyone that the writ of the Indian Constitution runs here and that Kashmir is part of India. More so, after the Kashmiri Pandits moved out of the Valley.â€™â€™

Incidentally, all this conversation was taking place at the office of National Conference candidate Ghulam Nabi Kachru, located in the deserted house of a Kashmiri Pandit, who had migrated to Jammu. He said he had taken the house â€˜â€˜on rent from a friendâ€™â€™. Kachru is contesting for the first time although he has been an NC member for long, representing the fruit growers and traders of the area.

He is confident of winning the election. â€˜â€˜The so-called incumbency factor does not work with me because I am a new face. I am sure to win.â€™â€™

A little distance away, officials on election duty were seen assembling at the Government Degree College at Baramulla. All of them were wearing bullet-proof jackets. Most of them were Muslims and hailed from Uttar Pradesh and other Hindi-speaking states.

Baramullaâ€™s deputy commissioner Navin Chaudhary confirmed that most of the election officials were Muslims from other parts of the the country because they knew Urdu. â€˜â€˜The electoral rolls here are in Urdu,â€™â€™ he informed.

2,Gujarat to decide country’s politics: Togadia,"LUCKNOW: International general secretary of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad Praveen Bhai Togadia on Sunday said the Gujarat elections would decide the politics of the country and would also leave its impact on Pakistan. He warned that â€œGodhra ka uttar aaj Gandhinagar, kal Dilli aur parson Pakistan mein diya jayegaâ€� (the reply to Godhra will be given today in Gandhinagar, tomorrow in Delhi and the day after in Pakistan).

He said the root cause of the Gujarat violence was the Godhra carnage and repetition of such incidents had to be avoided if peace had to prevail in the country. He denied that he had ever said what took place in Gujarat was a matter of pride. On the contrary, he maintained that what he had said was that the communal violence in Gujarat had to be analysed against the backdrop of the Godhra carnage which he termed as an act of terrorism. He alleged that the â€˜tabliqi jamaatâ€™ active in Godhra was the Indian version of the Taliban and was spreading its tentacles all over the country. Hitting put at chief election commissioner LM Lyngdoh, the general secretary said his speech at the IAS Academy after the Godhra carnage was that of a missionary. He simultaneously thanked him for postponing the elections in Gujarat as it had provided chief minister Narendra Modi an opportunity to widen his vote base. Modi ki yatra ab nikal chuki hai aur unka mat badh raha hai (Modiâ€™s yatra has begun and his vote bank is increasing).

Alleging that Indian secularists were behaving like Al-Jazeera (of Qatar), he said the country did not need this brand of secularism. In response to a query Togadia said that Swami Adhokshanand who was opposing the BJP in Gujarat was a fake Shankaracharya who had been put up by Congress president Sonia Gandhi to cast aspersions on Hindus supporting the BJP. He claimed that Adhokshanand had been barred by the court to enter Puri in Orissa.

Togadia said the VHP would organize a state-wide yatra of sants in Gujarat in October to garner support for the BJP in the elections.

Nearer home, Togadia said the first â€˜jathaâ€™ of â€˜Ram sadhaksâ€™ would reach Ayodhya on September 21. The jathas will comprise 150 Ram bhakts who will stay in the temple town for five days. The programme will continue for 45 days.

On September 28 an emergency meeting of the Sant Kendriya Mahamandal has been convened in Lucknow to discuss the courtâ€™s proposal to all parties about excavation at the disputed site, as also related issues.

On September 29 the UP Dharam Raksha Sammelan will be convened at Lucknow at the Laxman Mela site where a pledge will be taken by the participants for Dharam Raksha. Similar pledges will be taken by Ram Bhakts all over the country between September 29 and October 5.

Togadia said between November 15 and December 15 Dharan Jagran yatras would be taken out all over the state. A total of 1,500 yatras would be taken out, he added.

5,Transco tripped up on farmers’ use of power,"HYDERABAD: Even as APTransco chose to blame farmers for the rising demand for electricity and warned of action against those using phase converters for their pumpsets, it is trying to sweep under the carpet what it was supposed to do with such farm power connections.In its tariff order for the year 2002, the AP Electricity Regulatory Commission APERC) had clearly directed the power distribution companies (discoms) in the state to issue notices in newspapers and disconnect all connections using phase converters after a 30-day period. However, while not acting on this directive for all these months, Transco, in the face of mounting demand for power, on Saturday chose to place the entire blame on the farming community for the increased power consumption. As on September 14, the demand for power was to the tune of 145 million units against 130 million units since August 15 — when the government launched its programme of supplying 24 hours power to villages.In fact, in its orders on March 24, APERC had directed discoms to remove phase converters with 'immediate effect' as such equipment makes nine hours of power supply to farm connections meaningless as farmers can use single phase power as three phase and run their motors. The removal of phase converters was to be achieved by releasing advertisements through newspapers, then giving the farmers time to comply with the regulations. But anything to do with farmers is a sensitive issue and very little action has been taken on this front so far, a Transco official said.

10,J&K migrants in Delhi boycott polls,"NEW DELHI: Militant threat and Hurriyat''s boycott call may have kept voters away from Jammu and Kashmir elections, but the turnout of migrants, facing an uncertain future, was also poor at two booths provided for them here.

Out of 55 Kashmiri migrants registered to vote in the two special polling stations, only 14 exercised their franchise by the close of voting on Monday evening.

Of the 48 registered with the Jammu and Kashmir House here, only 14 voted and in Tis Hazari Courts, another special polling station which had seven voters, none turned up, poll officials said.

Some of the voters had earlier complained that their names were not found in the voters list.

In order to ensure that all the Kashmiri migrants were able to vote, the election commission has drawn up a scheme enabling the migrants from the Valley to vote in person and set up special polling stations in six places in Jammu, one in Udhampur and two in Delhi.

A release from the Displaced Kashmiri Pandit Forum said it decided to stay away from the poll process as ""election is in no way a solution to the problem of Kashmiri pandits who are in exile for the last 13 years now"".

The forum thanked the community members for not participating in the first phase of polling and resolved that in the coming phases the community''s response will be the same"", it said.

14,Mustaffa lambasts ministers for criticising govt,"KOCHI: Former Kerala minister T H Mustaffa on Monday flayed some state ministers who came out openly against the government''s decision to raise the power tariff, saying their action was violative of the oath of secrecy.

Speaking to reporters at a press conference here, Mustaffa said after collectively taking a decision at the cabinet, some ministers later aired their own views against the hike, which was not correct.

He said none could sideline Chief Minster A K Antony.

On the meeting of Kerala Congress (B) chairman K Balakrishna Pillai and IUML leader E Ahmed, MP, with Congress president Sonia Gandhi, Mustaffa said it was not right. The differences in the front, if any, should be sorted out within the state itself. Sonia Gandhi was the leader of the Congress and not the leader of the front, he said.

Replying to another question, he said if politicians could decide the retirement age of government servants, there should be retirement age for politicians too.

He described veteran Congress leader K Karunakaran''s outbursts against Antony as ''childish''.

17,Woman arrested for running brothel,"PUNE: The crime branch sleuths arrested a woman from the Shukrawar Peth area for running a brothel under the garb of a pen-pal club and marriage bureau on Saturday night.

According to a crime branch press release, it was an advertisement in the classified columns of local newspapers in the last few days that led to the arrest of Jyoti Maheshwari (40), a resident of Saranjame building in the Shukrawar Peth area.

The advertisement, in the name of PratiSneha Friendship Club, lured potential customers by saying, â€œDonâ€™t waste your life, have fun, be a member of our club and get male and female companionsâ€�.

It asked people to contact one Maheshwari and gave a telephone number. Social activist Suresh Chavanke, who called up the number, smelt something fishy and alerted commissioner of police Ranjit Singh Sharma.

Sharma immediately asked deputy commissioner of police (headquarters) Vasant Koregaonkar to take action. A team led by assistant commissioner of police (city division) A S Sheikh, inspector Dilip Shinde and assistant inspector Ramchandre Lotlikar, both from the crime branch, sent three decoys to Maheshwariâ€™s office with Rs 6,000.

Maheshwari was arrested as soon as she accepted the money. The police said Maheshwari used to organise parties in various hotels on the outskirts of the city for members of her â€˜clubâ€™.

The games in the party were such that it first encouraged and then gradually increased physical contact between men and women. Women members would then be lured into prostitution with promises of money and a posh life.

The membership for men was Rs 2,000 and they would be charged Rs 750 for every party. Membership was free for women.

18,Farmers plan protest over Cauvery water from today,"MANDYA: Farmers of eight districts in the Cauvery catchment area will launch a `jail bharo'' programme if the state government does not stop releasing water to Tamil Nadu from Tuesday.

Leaders have appealed to the protesters to stop `rail roko'' and `rasta roko'' agitations from Tuesday to make the `jail bharo'' a success.

A resolution to this effect was drawn up at a meeting of leaders of Mandya, Mysore, Hassan, Tumkur, Kodagu, Chamarajnagar, Bangalore Urban and Bangalore Rural districts here on Monday.

The leaders said the water available in the four reservoirs of the area was not sufficient to meet the needs of the people in the area itself. Hence the state should drop the idea of releasing water to Tamil Nadu.

Condemning the government for imposing prohibitory orders at the Kabini dam site to clear the way for releasing water to Tamil Nadu, the meet called for a non-cooperation movement, involving refusal to pay taxes and cess.

They termed as `shameful'' the government plan to pump dead storage water from the dams to feed Tamil Nadu. The meet invited Chief Minister S.M. Krishna to resign and join the people''s movement if the Supreme Court on September 23 passed an order against the state.

Presiding over the meeting at Raitha Sabhangana, Zilla Raitha Hitharakshana Samithi President G. Madegowda criticised the Congress legislators for not attending the meeting despite a written permission from the KPCC president that no disciplinary action would be taken against them.

Raitha Sangha President Prof. Nanjunda Swamy said it was high time the failure of Tamil Nadu in the utilisation of water was exposed. Policies should be formulated to make good use of available water and solve inter-state water disputes.

Saying that Krishna would have become a hero if he had courted arrest rejecting the Supreme Court and Cauvery River Authority orders, legislator P.G.R. Sindhia condemned the ""police assault"" on farmers at Kabini. State JD(S) President Siddaramaiah said the protests were inevitable as the state had heeded both the Centre and Tamil Nadu.

A public meeting was held at the Silver Jubilee park later in the evening. Rasta roko, rail roko, processions and burning of effigies continued throughout the day in the district on Monday. However, police blockades, hindering traffic in the city, irked the public. KSRTC buses stayed off the roads completely.

Tension prevailed in the district and some shops downed shutters voluntarily. Farmers of the Kiragavalu assembly constituency staged dharna at the KRS dam and Dowary Samaj members staged a relay hunger strike.

19,Munde flays govt on hooch deaths in state,"PUNE: Expressing concern over the death of people in Navi Mumbai due to consumption of illicit liquor laced with methanol, the BJP national vice-president, Gopinath Munde on Monday charged the Maharashtra government of backing this business.

Addressing reporters here, Munde said a total of 25 persons had died due to consumption of illicit liquor and said the government was least bothered about this.

Accusing the government of conniving with the liqour mafia, Munde said the police was unable to act because the government was supporting them.

He said the manufacturers were mixing methanol with liquor which was a poisonous substance and hence a probe should be demanded to find out who were supplying methanol to the illicit liquor manufacturers.

Munde demanded that the government should pay proper compensation to the next of the kin of the deceased.

22,Online lottery case casts ominous shadow on govt,"CHANDIGARH: While the CBI is yet to grant its consent to the UT administrationâ€™s request to transfer investigation in the Rs 9,300-crore Punjab online lottery case to it, the case has started creating a palpable sense of discomfort in the state government.

At a the time when chief minister Amarinder Singh is riding high on the crest of anti-corruption campaign, the alleged bungling in the multi-crore online lottery case is expected to cast its ominous shadow on his six-monthold government, particularly amid reports that persons close to him played a dubious role in allotting the bid to the Mumbai-based M/s Venture Business Advisers Pvt Ltd Consortium.

The UT administration had sought to hand over the investigation to the CBI last week after realising that it had inter-state ramifications.

The decision, however, caused ruffles in certain official circles as the UT administration did not seek the Punjab governmentâ€™s opinion on the matter and unilaterally resolved to hand over the investigation to the CBI, something that the chief ministerâ€™s bete noire Parkash Singh Badal had been demanding.

The administration , however, rebuts the contention and says that it was not legally-bound to consult the Punjab government on the matter and the decision had been taken purely on the merits of the case.

A section in the government believes that Badal might have influenced the UT administration through deputy prime minister L K Advani to transfer the investigation to the CBI.

The CBI findings in course of its investigation could became a cause of embarrassment if it names anybody close to the chief minister as a beneficiary in allotting the multi-crore bid to a concern which failed to furnish credible guarantee.

The local CBI office has forwarded the UT administrationâ€™s request to its headquarters in New Delhi to seek approval for pursuing the investigation in the case.

A letter of intent was issued by the state government to the Mumbaibased concern after its bid for Rs 9,301 crore was accepted for running the online lottery for seven years.

The concern was found to have faltered when it came to providing bank guarantee worth Rs 5 crore.

Initially, the concern offered bogus Rs 50 lakh guarantee of the SBI, and later offered Rs 5 crore guarantee issued by M/s Western Cooperative Bank Ltd against whom the RBI had already initiated liquidation proceedings.

The state government has also served a show-cause notice on the concern suggesting termination of the deal in view of bogus and illegal guarantees submitted by it.

23,Puppets tug at heart-strings of riot-hit children,"MUMBAI: In a relief camp in Gujarat, a puppetry workshop is in session. A woman holds up a puppet, vacanteyed, dishevelled, a tad grotesque. â€œWhoâ€™s this?â€™â€™ she asks the children sitting in a straggly heap in the large room.

â€œAapa,â€™â€™ volunteers one. â€œWhat do you think Aapa looks like?â€™â€™ she questions. â€œDukhi hai,â€™â€™ says a little boy. Why? â€œBecause her husband died...in the Hindu-Muslim ladaai.â€™â€™

In another session, the mood is less sombre, with a little girl waggling two fingers through a cardboardcutout puppet.

Sheâ€™s reciting a poem about a cat, cheered on by a roomful of chanting kids.â€�Where does the cat go?â€™â€™

â€œTo get milkâ€™â€™ â€œWhere?â€™â€™

â€œTo the relief camp.â€™â€™

â€œWhy is she in the relief camp?â€™â€™

â€œBecause her house was burnt down.â€™â€™

â€œBurnt down by who?â€™â€™

â€œHindus.â€™â€™

The denouement, though expected, gives you gooseflesh. As do several other moments in the documentary Gudiya Relief Camp Mein Kyon Hai?, a 15-minute encapsulation of the postriot life of Gujaratâ€™s children, produced by veteran actress and puppeteer Meena Naik.

Says Ms Naik, who visited two camps in Sabarkantha district to hold play therapy workshops for the children there, â€œWhen I went initially in mid-May, I had no plans of making a film, but then I thought that the injustice that has been done to these children had to be put down in black and white for more people to witness. My focus here is child rights.â€™â€™

Accordingly, Ms Naik has sent copies of the documentary to organisations like UNICEF and CRY for wider dissemination. Indeed, while the children appear to be reasonably happy in the film, some of them have been through unimaginable horror, says Ms Naik.

â€œThere was this little boy called Salman who was an active participant,â€™â€™ she says.

â€œAfter the kids had made their puppets and were going back to the relief camps to show them to their families, my cameraman jovially asked him, â€˜So, youâ€™re waiting to show your mother and father what you did?â€™ Thatâ€™s when he told us that his entire family had been wiped out in the riots.â€™â€™

Other conversations bring out the ghastly sights the children have been forced to witness: a woman who was stripped and repeatedly raped in front of them, for instance.

Certain visuals are equally traumaticâ€”like a gruesome shot of charred babies and children laid out in a row.

â€œThis footage was shot by a professional videographer in Narodia Patia when the rioting first began,â€™â€™ says Ms Naik.

â€œA friend of mine had also recorded a few audio interviews those days..though there was very little clarity because of the mayhem all around, we used a few of them on our soundtrack.â€™â€™

In contrast, the shots of the workshops bring out another face of the children, curiously almost impersonal about the upheaval they have been through.

â€œThey were laughing and playing with us, and that was the object of my therapy,â€™â€™ says Ms Naik.

â€œIt was important to catharsise all that internalised trauma and weed out feelings of hatred and revenge. And they did open up a lot. One boy, for instance, when asked what he wanted to be when he grew up, told us that he wanted to be a teacher. And what would he teach, we asked him. â€˜I will teach children ekta (unity),â€™ he replied.â€™â€™

That reply could well have been a consequence of the children being made to chant Hum saath saath hain and Saare jahan se achcha at the end of the workshops, but then again it might well have been straight from the heart.

â€œThe irony of those songs was so bitter that I almost felt guilty for making the children sing them,â€™â€™ says Ms Naik.

â€œBut the heartening thing was that they did.â€™â€™

The wonderful thing about children, as she says in the film, is that they can be mouldedâ€”they can be taught to love and sing and play instead of to hate and riot. â€œAnd thatâ€™s what we should all aim to do,â€™â€™ she says.

â€œLet our children grow up happy and with untwisted mindsâ€”thatâ€™s the very least we can do for them.â€™â€™ Veteran actress Meena Naik with children in a puppetry workshop in a relief camp in Gujarat.

24,"Deshmukh, Kalmadi use festival for political gain","MUMBAI: The mundane factional feuds within the state unit of the Congress have assumed a divine dimension. Rival groupsâ€”one led by chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh, the other by member of parliament Suresh Kalmadiâ€”are using the Ganesh festival to try to gain ascendency in Pune politics.

This year, the famed Pune Festival that Mr Kalmadi started a decade ago has some competition. Mr Deshmukhâ€™s followers have launched a five-day cultural fest of their own, called the Ganesh Festival.

The CMâ€™s cause is being championed by Congress MLC Ulhas Pawar and minister of state for public works Balasaheb Shivarkar. Mr Shivarkar is the chief patron of the Ganesh Festival.

The Ganesh Festivalâ€”which is being touted as a cultural extravaganza â€”started on September 10 on the grounds of the historic Shaniwarwada fort.

Mr Deshmukh stayed away, but the star guest for the event was Biharâ€™s strongman and former chief minister Laloo Prasad Yadav. Mr Yadav was apparently there on an invitation from Mr Deshmukh.

Baited in his own lair, Mr Kalmadi displayed his hostility towards the chief minister by inviting Lok Sabha speaker Manohar Joshi of the Shiv Sena to be the chief guest for his Pune Festival.

Never one to shy away from the opportunity to take a swipe at his political opponents, Mr Joshi in his inaugural address remarked on the â€œincreasing politicisation of Ganesh pandalsâ€™â€™, his tongue firmly in cheek.

But the rivalry between the Congress groups didnâ€™t stop at mere rhetoric. The Kalmadi camp tried to stall the rival festival.

Although the Deshmukh camp had booked the open-air auditorium at Shaniwarwada, Pune mayor Dipti Chaudhari â€”a Kalmadi followerâ€”at a meeting of the Pune municipal corporationâ€™s standing committee pressed for the booking to be cancelled.

Ms Chaudhari insisted that the ground be made available to the Pune municipal corporation-sponsored Ganesh Festival and not to the one organised by Mr Shivarkar and Mr Pawar. But she backed down when Mr Shivarkar threatened to drag the civic body to court.

In a bid to avoid further embarrassment, Mr Kalmadi announced that the Ganesh Festival would be held at Shaniwarwada after September 15.

The PMC has invited deputy chief minister Chhagan Bhujbal to inaugurate its event.

25,DDA ex-official arrested,"NEW DELHI: Two persons were arrested for their alleged involvement in the multi-crore Delhi Development Authority (DDA) housing scam.

DDA ex-official Mahesh Chandra Mahajan, who had taken voluntary retirement, and property dealer Shashi Bhushan were arrested by the economic offences wing (EOW) of the Delhi Police on Thursday.

â€˜â€˜The two have been arrested in connection with the DDA housing scam related to the restoration of cancelled SFS flats in prime south Delhi localities to fake allottees and for subsequent fraudulent refunds,â€™â€™ Dinesh Bhatt, deputy commissioner of police (DCP) EOW, said.

Bhatt said the two were involved in wrongfully encashing refund cheques issued DDA to the original applicants.

The refunds were for 111 flats in Sarita Vihar, Sheikh Sarai, Vasant Kunj and Jasola. The money was to be refunded as DDA reduced the price of the flats, after collecting the entire cost from applicants.

With the latest arrests, 24 cases of cheating, forgery and misappropriation have been registered in the case. The accused have been sent to judicial custody for 14 days. DDA housing commissioner D B Gupta noticed it first when he came across about 118 such fraudulent transactions in October 2000.

In one case, he had filed an FIR for a Vasant Kunj flat which had been fraudulently allotted to a fake A P Arora, who had proposed a refund of Rs 8.35 lakh.

â€˜â€˜In reality, the original Arora belonged to Jammu and had already collected his refund,â€™â€™ Gupta said.

â€˜â€˜Investigations revealed that Mahajan, on the basis of forged documents, got the flat allotted in the name of Arora and also filed a fake application for the refund,â€™â€™ Bhatt said.

26,MPCC report criticises Deshmukh government,"MUMBAI: The Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee has sent a report to the central leadership of the party which is highly damaging to the Vilasrao Deshmukh government.

The report says that while in urban areas the party has been able to more or less retain its base, in rural Maharashtra it has not performed well as is evident by the outcome of elections to local self-government bodies.

The report, which has been sent by MPCC president Govindrao Adik, lists a number of reasons for this state of affairs.

It says that the â€œshoddy handlingâ€™â€™ of the monopoly cotton procurement scheme has alienated farmers of Vidarbha and Marathwada regions. The other reasons listed are â€œirregular supply of electricity, very harsh and inhuman methods for recovering electricity and water dues from farmers, weakening of the public distribution system, lack of initiative on the part of the government to restart closed industries and failure to provide succour to unemployed persons.â€™â€™

Mr Adik has also accused the government of not starting any â€œworthwhile self-employment scheme.â€™â€™

He said the declaration of the bankruptcy of 20 cooperative sugar factories by the government and its statement that â€œit was not interested in reviving themâ€™â€™ has cost the party heavily in the elections to these factories which play a major role in rural Maharashtra.

Lakhs of farmers are members of these factories. Mr Adik also noted that more than 50 antiminority and anti-Dalit riots have taken place ever since the party came to power in the state.

Besides, the recommendations of the Srikrishna and Gundewar commissions, which probed the 1992-93 communal riots and police firing at Ramabai Colony in Ghatkopar in 1997, have not been implemented.

Government corporations like the ones named after Maulana Abdul Kalam Azad, Vasantrao Naik, Mahatma Phule and Annabhau Sathe â€œhave been starved of funds by our government.â€™â€™

These corporations were set up for the economic uplift of Muslims, nomadic tribes, Dalits, Adivasis and the Matang community.

The MPCC chief has also alleged that the Krishna, Godavari and Tapi river valley corporations are non-functional and cases of corruption in these bodies are now coming to light.

â€œThere are specific allegations of corruption against our ministers like taking money for giving employment, selling of a spinning mill (at Latur) below market rate and the shielding of a corrupt official of the Latur Nagar Parishad.â€™â€™

Mr Adik has alleged that Congress ministers are â€œseldom available in their offices for meeting people and they never consult the party before going on tours and they never taken PCC office-bearers with them.â€™â€™

â€œAs against this, the chief minister and Congress ministers gladly share the stage with NCP office-bearers.â€™â€™

The MPCC has also noted that when the Congress-led Democratic Front government took charge about three years ago, the governmentâ€™s debut burden was Rs 40,000 crores and now it stands at Rs 70,000 crores.

Mr Adik said there has been no effort at cost cutting. Instead, Mr Deshmukh has a jumbo-sized cabinet and money is spent on refurbishing of ministersâ€™ chambers and official homes and MLAs are being appointed on government corporations with cabinet status which involves huge expenses.

The anti-drought measures adopted by the government are ineffective and the death of Adivasi children due to malnutrition has been adversely commented upon by the courts. Several Central government schemes are not being implemented by the state because of â€œlack of interest.â€™â€™

The schemes include the Jawahar Gram Samruddi Yojana, Prime Ministerâ€™s village road scheme, Silver Jubilee Self-employment scheme and National child labour project.

â€œOur government has failed miserably failed to attract external aid and foreign investment and states like Rajasthan, Gujarat and Karnataka have outpaced our state in this regard,â€™â€™ Mr Adik stated. He has also charged the government with â€œlack of imagination.â€™â€™

The zunka bhakar scheme started by the Shiv Sena-BJP government for supplying cheap food to the poor was discontinued unnecessarily.

Referring to the poor performance of the party in the local self-government polls, Mr Adik has accused the CMâ€™s supporters (without naming them) of sabotaging the polls.

He has offered proof to corroborate this charge. Mr Adik has also proposed a series of steps to revive the party.

One of the suggestions is that the chief minister and Congress ministers should accept a token salary of Re 1 per month and corruption should be combated on a war footing at all levels.
