1,Hooda asks CM for white paper on pact with farmers,"CHANDIGARH: Haryana Congress president Bhupinder Singh Hooda, on Wednesday, asked chief minister Om Prakash Chautala to come out with a â€˜â€˜white paperâ€™â€™ on the agreement entered into with farmers on their demands made at Kandela on January 31 this year.

Speaking at a press conference here, Hooda said that the main reason for the present unrest among the state farmers was the Chautala governmentâ€™s failure to implement Kandela agreement under which it had agreed to withdraw cases against farmers and also release their arrested leaders.

Voicing concern over farmersâ€™ agitation in the state, Hooda urged the chief minister to take the initiative to start talks with the agitating farmers by releasing their leaders.

Defending farmersâ€™ decision to hold rallies in support of their demands, Congresss president said it was their democratic right and if the government felt that it could suppress them by resorting to coercive measures, it was living in a foolâ€™s paradise.

The government had already tasted farmersâ€™ wrath at Kandela on Sunday when it failed to stop them from attending the rally despite the fact that it had clamped prohibitory orders in the area, said Hooda, reminding the chief minister that it was he who, while in opposition, used to instigate farmers into not paying their power bills.

It was as a result of this that they were now burdened with huge arrears running into lakhs, alleged Hooda, adding that again it was Chautala who used to tell farmers that as and when his party came to power he would waive off their power arrears. The irony was that instead of waiving off these arrears, his police was now firing on farmers to recover arrears from them, said the HPCC president.

Hooda announced that if the government failed to redress the grievances of the farmers, the Congress would hold a â€˜â€˜mahakisan panchayatâ€™â€™ on June 23 to chalk out an action plan to force the government to accept their demands.

Asked if he was in favour of farmers taking government servants hostage to pressurise the government, Hooda said his party had nothing to do with all this as it was farmersâ€™ decision.

He said that he had been telling both, the farmers and the government, that talks were the only way to settle their differences.

2,Bhimbandh has 497 carnivores,"PATNA: Though the Munger forest division encompassing parts of three districts was declared a protected wildlife sanctuary in 1976 and named Bhimbandh wildlife sanctuary, it is only now that it may proudly claim to be on the wildlife map of the country, with 497 major carnivores, including tigers and leopards, spotted there, according to reports reaching here.

The revelation has come following the first scientific carnivore census done in the Bhimbandh wildlife sanctuary from April 19 to 25, which was jointly conducted by the Munger forest division and a Bhagalpur-based conservation group, Neelkanth Club.

The forest division covers 681 square-km area falling in Munger district and parts of Jamui and Lakhisarai districts.

The census revealed that the area had â€œat leastâ€� 11 tigers, 39 leopards, 113 hyenas, 87 wolves and 247 sloth bears, over and above minor carnivores like jackals and other animals, said divisional forest officer M J Mishra from Munger on telephone.

Mishra said that the only known wildlife sanctuary in residual Bihar after the creation of Jharkhand was the Bettiah Reserve Tiger Project area. He said that â€œisolated and migratoryâ€� carnivores could also be found in the forests of Banka, Gaya and Kaimur.

On the margin of error in the count of the carnivores in the Bhimbandh sanctuary, he said it was 10 per cent. â€œBut the final figures about the population of carnivores given are after accounting for the margin of error,â€� Mishra said, adding: â€œIt is a very important development for this sanctuaryâ€�.

5,Army withdrawal scares riot victims,"AHMEDABAD: Apprehension is rife in the riot-relief camps dotting the city. This time around, the anxiety does not stem from any communal strife but the fact that their ''guardian angels'' -the Army men- have left the city to protect the country''s borders.

Abdul Hamid, who still remembers how he had escaped the rioters'' wrath while his house and belongings were reduced to ashes, said, ""Army is needed for our safety. We understand the compulsions that have drawn away the Army, we are ready to fight for our country, too. But, so long as we have to stay at relief camps Army presence is needed to ensure our safety.""

Hamid used to stay in the Baba Barkulla area of Shahibaug before taking shelter at the Dariakhan Ghummat relief camp. Co-ordinator of this camp in Shahibaug Ataullah Khan says: Though policing has improved in the past 12 days, absence of Army could spell trouble for us. Already this camp has been under attack twice. Army should have left Gujarat only after the Rathyatra.

A team of minority leaders, including Khan, had on Tuesday met police commissioner KR Kaushik to discuss the security aspect. And Kaushik''s assurances of maintaining peace notwithstanding, fears persist among the camp inmates.

""Top police officers have been replaced by better and efficient ones. But, those at the station level remain the same. It is this group that has inflicted maximum damage on us during riots,"" said Khan.

Mohsin Kadri, chief organiser of one of the largest relief camps in the city at Shah-e-Alam Roza, adds, ""I had called up the DIG police to prevent Army from moving out"".

Reposing faith in the local police was Maulvi Shabbir Siddiqui of the Jama Masjid. ""Ultimately it is the local police who will have to maintain peace. With the arrival of super cop KPS Gill matters are moving in the right direction.""

Abdul Karim R Shelat, an organiser of a relief camp that shelters 2,300 victims near Sanklit Nagar of Juhapura, said, ""Withdrawal of Army is a matter of concern but so long as CRPF or paramilitary forces are around in the present trend of ''professional'' policing , we are relatively safe.""

This came to light after task force personnel nabbed the gang members at Secunderabad on Monday. It was led by Ankireddy Chandrasekhara Reddy, an accomplice of Suri.

Addressing reporters here on Tuesday, additional commissioner of police A K Khan said that a tip off led the police to monitor the gangâ€™s activities.

Two revolvers, 12 cartridges and three cellular phones were also seized.

The arrested include Chandrasekhara Reddy and B Madan Mohan Reddy of Cuddapah and L Vijaya Bhaskar Reddy and Bhanu Kiran of Anantapur. Six more were held based on the information provided by the arrested men.

According to Khan, the arrested men confessed that the Jubilee Hills blast case convict Suri was their boss and that he used to communicate through a mobile phone.

11,Former PPSC chief says it is political vendetta,"BATHINDA: Former PPSC chairman Bhupinder Singh Sidhu against whom the vigilance bureau began a probe on Wednesday into charges of amassing assets disproportionate to his known sources of income, has accused a senior Congress leader of the area, who lost the February assembly election to his son by a close margin from Talwandi Sabo seat in Bathinda district, for being indulged in a vitriolic campaign against the family.

An inquiry was ordered by chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh after a newspaper report carried details of assets worth rupees several crores allegedly owned by Sidhu.

In a press note released on Thursday, Sidhu gave details of properties owned by him and sources from which he later used to make the property. He alleged that his family was being targeted as his son Mohinder Jeet Sidhu, who contested Talwandi Sabo seat as an independent candidate wrested it from Harminder Singh Jassi, the district president of Bathinda Congress.

As it is alleged that Sidhu was close to the then governor of Punjab Surinder Nath, Sidhu asserted that at the time of his nomination as PPSC member, Varinder Verma was the governor and not Surinder Nath. He claimed that Surinder Nath himself was member of UPSC, New Delhi.

About list of properties about which the vigilance bureau was asked to probe by the chief minister, Sidhu sought to clarify that the properties belonged to his relatives including his in-laws, sonsin-law and was bequeathed to him by his grand parents.

12,Badal to court arrest on June 11,"CHANDIGARH: The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and the BJP turned the heat on chief minister Amarinder Singh on Thursday, when they in separate memorandums to governor F R Jacob, charged that the Congress government had made vendetta and vilification against the opposition the guiding principle of the state policy"".

""The utterly irresponsible and adventurist policies coupled with repressive and undemocratic approach has posed a serious threat to the state polity,"" they alleged and urged the governor to caution the state government against it.

Former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal, after lying low for about two months, got on the offensive when at meetings with the party leaders here on Thursday, the SAD president attributed the Bhikhiwind killings to political vendetta unleashed by the Congress.

In order to protest against the killings, all SAD MPs, MLAs, and district unit presidents led by Badal would offer mass arrest here on June 11. Badal said SAD leader, Gurdial Singh, one of the six persons killed in the incident, fell victim to the plot hatched at the behest of irrigation minister Gurchet Singh Bhullar.

Demanding immediate removal of the minister from the state Cabinet, Badal said that Bhullar be arrested forthwith and the inquiry into the incident be handed over to the CBI.

Badal once again took exception to the state government''s indifference to Gurdial Singhâ€™s plea for security, days before his murder took place. Gurdial had named the irrigation minister as one of his rivals, who had threatened his life.

The SAD chief demanded that a case of conspiracy be registered against Bhullar in this context.

He said Gurdial''s murder was not case in isolation. Badal cited instances of three other Akali leaders who had been done to death, allegedly at the behest of the Congress leaders, in the recent past.

He said the Amarinder Singh government had unleashed an era of political murders targeting SAD workers.

Badal also took exception to the manner in which the chief minister had granted a clean chit to the minister even after he had been named in the FIR as an accused.

The chief minister''s proclamations in support of Bhullar, he said, were meant to influence the police investigations in the case.

In the memorandum submitted to the governor, the former chief minister demanded immediate end to the reign of repression let lose on the opposition and wanted the government to restrain itself from framing cooked up criminal charges against their SAD leaders.

13,Expert rules out war,"PATIALA: There is no scope of full fledged war between India and Pakistan in the near future, however, the present tension could go on for months or even for some years. This was said by Karamjit Singh Sidhu, a noted defence expert and professor in the department of defence studies in the Punjabi University, Patiala, in a interview to Times News Network.

He said that at this juncture of time, both the countries could not afford any conventional or nuclear war.

He said the statement of Pakistan that it would not hesitate to use the nuclear bomb if war was imposed on them, was mere rhetoric, as they knew that a nuclear war could ruin them also.

Sidhu said that due to its internal problems, Pakistan would never leave the issue of Kashmir, while India should make more diplomatic efforts to get the support of other countries.

He said that the Pakistan should accept India''s supremacy in the region as India was more powerful in all aspects than Pakistan, but the leaders of Pakistan were not ready for this, as the anti-India card was the best way for their survival.

He further said that after fighting three wars with India, Pakistan had realised that it cannot defeat India.
