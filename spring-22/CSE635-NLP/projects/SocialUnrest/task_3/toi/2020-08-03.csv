0,LeT suicide squad in city,"NEW DELHI: As the independence day draws nearer, Delhi Police and other security agencies are on high alert. There is a possibility that a three-member Lashker-e-Taiba suicide squad has reached the capital to cause trouble.

According to police sources, in view of intelligence inputs received from Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) all efforts are on to nab the terrorists before they strike.

The information from J&K revealed that LeT planned to carry out subversive actions in Delhi or Gujarat around August 15. The police said that vital installations and â€˜â€˜some softâ€™â€™ targets were likely to be on the hitlist.

1,BC students want govt to pay engineering fee,"HYDERABAD: Hundreds of Backward Caste (BC) students held an agitation on Sunday demanding the government to pay their engineering course fee and lower the Eamcet cut-off marks by five per cent.

State BC student''s union convener J Srinivas Goud, in a press release, said the agitation would be intensified if the demands were not met.

State BC welfare committee president R Krishnaiah said after the introduction of common fee policy, many BC students were unable to afford engineering education. Not even 20 per cent of the seats were filled because of the fee hike, he said.

2,Port unrest: mud-slinging continues,"KOLKATA: It was on Wednesday that port labourers bearing CITU flags and banners stalled the unloading of petroleum coke from an Indonesian vessel at the Kolkata Dock System. A day later, CITU leaders disowned the labourers as â€˜trouble makersâ€™ belonging to Port Shramik Janata Panchayat, led by Noor Ahmed.

Even the handling contractors of the cargo claimed that Ahmed had demanded money from them to allow the mechanical handling of cargo. On Sunday, however, Ahmed denied charges made against him and said that the labourers had joined the CITU two years ago. He said that the CITU had written to the stevedores, clearing agents, handling contractors and also the police -- demanding jobs for labourers or adequate compensation.

â€œIt is true that the labourers belonged to my union two years ago. However, now they have joined the CITU. They went around with letters written on CITU stationary, asking for jobs even before the ship berthed at the port. Now, since everybody is in a spot, they are blaming me,â€� Ahmed said.

Though leaders of the CITU affiliated Calcutta Port and Shore Mazdoor Union admitted that some of the labourers may have been their members, they were quick to point out that Ahmed had incited the workers into behaving the way they did.

â€œThere may have been some CITU members among those who created a ruckus on Wednesday but they were incited by Noor Ahmed. There are many letters written by the CITU. How is it that Ahmed is so sure of this one ? All this disturbance is his handiwork,â€� accused Hemlal Chatterjee, general secretary of the union.

There are two prominent unions at the Kolkata Dock System recognised by the board of trustees of the Kolkata Port Trust. One is CITU affiliated and the other is the Calcutta Port Shramik Union affiliated to the HMS. There are around 7,500 workers at KDS presently.

â€œWe are co-operating with port authorities for the revival of KDS. There is a lot of work at the port. It is untrue that labour is surplus at KDS. The biggest problem is the proper redeployment of workers from one department to another. While one department may have a few surplus workers, some other departments are understaffed. There would be no labour trouble if the administration utilised the staff in a better manner,â€� Chatterjee said.

3,Cong plans 'village bandh' on Aug 8,"AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat Pradesh Congress Committee at its meeting held here on Sunday has decided to go ahead with its plan for ''village bandh'' and rasta roko on August 8, to protest against the steep increase in the power tariff for farm sector and also the hike in college fees.

4,New govt buildings to be quake-resistant,"GANDHINAGAR: Around 70 new government building coming up Kutch and Saurashtra are being built as per the standard specifications of earthquake-resistance technology and in accordance with the National Building Code to avert possible damage in case of future earthquakes.

State roads and buildings minister I K Jadeja, who recently reviewed the rehabilitation of four major cities of Bhuj, Rapar, Anjar and Bhachau, said civil engineers and architects entrusted the work in Kutch have been asked to adhere to central guidance in regard to structural safety and norms of NBC in this earthquake prone region.

The government has also decided to implement the same guidelines in other parts of the state as a precautionary measure. The new constructions carried out by the roads and buildings department would also strictly follow the new guidelines drawn up after the quake on January 26, 2001.

He said the construction of the government buildings, including the deputy collector and mamlatdar''s offices and multi-storey buildings for other departments, was in full swing. Several new buildings in these four cities would be ready by the end of December, and the offices now functioning in temporary structures would be shifted to new premises.

The estimated cost of these buildings has been pegged at Rs 150 crore of which half the amount has been received as part of World Bank loan and financial assistance from European Commission.

The government has set up a mechanism in the department for quality-control of the material being used in the construction of the government buildings. Any violation in the rules would attract punitive action for the technocrats who have assigned the job.

Jadeja said as many as 25 deputy engineers have been shunted out to insignificant postings after being found guilty in complaints pertaining to poor quality of construction and other irregularities.

Referring to economy drive, he said the department had decided to inaugurate the seven new World Bank-aided road projects by holding a seminar on technical subjects in Gandhinagar Town Hall on Thursday.

More than 750 engineers of the department are expected to participate in the workshop which would have meaningful discussion on ''Workmanship, Quality Control and Time Management''.

Officials of the rank of deputy engineer to chief engineer would assemble at one place and exchange views on these subjects. Some experts have also been invited to the seminar.

Chief Minister Narendra Modi will inaugurate the workshop.

5,TDP against advancing LS elections,"NEW DELHI: While the BJP is keeping its options open on an early poll next February, Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu is reported to have conveyed to PM Vajpayee that the TDP wants the next general election be held on schedule in September 2004.

The BJP has officially said it does not favour an early poll, but party strategists maintain that it could opt for a general election next February if it fares well in this yearâ€™s assembly elections in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and Delhi.

TDP sources said Naidu had told the PM and Deputy PM Advani that his party is not for advancing the general election. While Advani has not given any assurance to Naidu on poll timing, he is learnt to have requested the TDP chief, a key NDA ally, not to go public with his views. Since this issue is wide open, Naidu has, nevertheless, instructed his cadres to start preparations for a February election.

Ideally, the TDP would like the Lok Sabha and the AP assembly election to be held simultaneously. In such a case, it feels, national issues would dominate and help the ruling TDP to tide over the anti-incumbency sentiment. Besides, Vajpayeeâ€™s personal image would also help shift the focus from local issues.

TDP leaders maintain that an early election does not suit their party for two reasons. Andhra Pradesh, they point out, is slated to face an assembly election later next year. In case the Lok Sabha poll is held next February and the BJP does not do as well as envisaged, this result could have an adverse impact on their stateâ€™s assembly election. On the other hand, if the BJP does well, it will be emboldened to bargain for a larger share of seats in the assembly election, say TDP leaders. Seat-sharing, they add, is always a tricky issue.

6,College principals over 60 to go,"MUMBAI: A recent University of Mumbai directive has made it compulsory for college principals to graduate to a retired life at 60.

The circular has sent college managements into a tizzy, given that principals are already in short supply thanks to a UGG norm which requires all principals to hold a Ph D.

While government rules stipulate an official retirement age of 60, the varsity has so far been liberal with its superannuation policy, permitting principals to remain in office until the age of 65.

The varsity circular directing colleges to replace all 60-plus principals by December 31, 2003, has college managements worried. Three years ago, the University Grants Commission (UGC) issued a notice stating that all new appointees to the post of principal must have a doctrate.

â€œThis has made it very difficult to find qualified teachers with ample administrative experience for the post,â€™â€™ said K.A. Vishwanathan, trustee of SIES College.Already, according to university officials, as many as 92 colleges have ad hoc or in-charge principals because of the UGC requirement.

Among the principals declared over the hill are N W Shivdasani of Jai Hind College, M.G. Srihatti of Lala Lajpatrai College of Commerce, M K Desai of Narsee Monjee College of Commerce and A.D. Mascarenhas of St Andrewâ€™s College, Bandra (West).

SIES science college principal V. Padmanabhan, who is due to retire on September 30, said, â€œThe university is under tremendous pressure to abide by the UGC guidelines.â€™â€™ Mr Padmanabhan, who has been SIES principal for eight years, added that, in the short run, colleges may find it difficult to get senior teachers with Ph.Ds to serve principals. â€œThe younger teachers should take note of this development and gear up for the future,â€™â€™ he said.

To justify their new retirement policy, varsity officials pointed out that principals over 60 did not draw their salary from the government but are paid by their college managements.

â€œThis could prevent them from questioning the management in matters concerning college administration,â€™â€™ university official said. The official added that the move would make way for younger teachers to take on the responsibility of steering the college.

â€œBut what about valuing our experience?â€™â€™ asked Mr Mascarenhas, who has challenged the varsityâ€™s decision to disapprove his reappointment under the superannuation policy in court.He also claimed that the university approved the reappointment of principals in a very arbitrary manner.

7,State govt plans insurance cover for school kids,"MUMBAI: The Maharashtra government is considering a proposal to insure all schoolchildren in the state against accidents.

Under the scheme, the state will pay the annual premium of around Rs 4 crore for 25 million children in public and private schools.

This is the first time in India that schoolchildren in any state are being bought under the purview of the accident insurance cover.

A senior insurance company official said each child would be insured for Rs 50,000. The highlights of the scheme include medical compensation and bicycle damages expenses up to Rs 1,500 each, and Rs 500 for damaged spectacles.

School education minister Ambarish Patel said that the proposal made by the New India Assurance Company was being verified.

According to an official of the insurance company, a final meeting between government officials and the insurance company is slated for next week and the chief minister is expected to announce the scheme on Independence Day.

C B Turkar, deputy secretary in the women and child welfare department, said that while the accident rate was not high among school students in Maharashtra, the scheme might be able to reduce the drop-out rate and discourage child labour in rural areas. â€œThe drop-out rate is very high after the 4th standard and higher among girl students,â€™â€™ he said.

9,TRS leaders lash out at ministers,"HYDERABAD: Nizamabad Zilla Parishad chairman and TRS leader S Santosh Reddy has accused some ministers of politicising the Godavari Pushkarams and levelling baseless allegations against TRS president K Chandrasekhar Rao.

In a statement issued on Sunday, the ZP chairman said information minister S Chandramohan Reddy, who took a dip at Basar on the first day of the Pushkarams, had unnecessarily raked up political issues.

He said the day in, day out criticism of the Rao by ministers only reflects the demoralisation that has set in in the TDP. He also lambasted them for ''misinterpreting'' the statement on lifting ban on the PW.

TRS leader Cherukupalli Narsimha Reddy warned the TDP leaders, particularly ministers hailing from Telangana, against criticising the TRS president.

""People will not tolerate any criticism of Chandrasekhar Rao. He is the undisputed leader of Telangana,"" he claimed.

10,Christian body flays St Mary's principal,"LUCKNOW: The All India Christian Peopleâ€™s Forum (AICPF) on Sunday held a meeting at the Young Menâ€™s Christian Association (YMCA) and condemned the act of Father John Augustine, principal of St Maryâ€™s School, who led a violent demonstration of schoolchildren which saw heavy stone-pelting on police and firing in the air by protesters accompanying the students.

The delegates, who converged for the meeting from different parts of the state, held John Augustine as a self-proclaimed priest and an anti-social element who, they alleged, was bringing bad name to the community by adopting pressure tactics to meet his vested interests.

Expressing deep concern over the manner the protest was held, the AICPF alleged that John Augustine was hand in glove with local petty politicians and used to resort to cheap publicity stunts to gain popularity. Those attending the meeting held the incident as a part of a well-planned strategy of vested interests who wanted to quench their thirst for political gains at the cost of naive students.

Christian Welfare and Development Society (CWDS) general secretary Vinsent Crowther stated that hardcore political and religious fundamentalists were deliberately giving rise to such violent situations to create an air of communal unrest targeting the Christian minority. He said that it was at the behest of such leaders that properties and issues related to Christians had come under cloud.

Secretary of AICPF BK Phillips accused John Augustine of joining hands with Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Mulayam Singh Yadavâ€™s son Akhilesh who visited John in jail. Phillips stated that Akhilesh was from the same SP which had forcibly taken away 40 acres of land belonging to the Christian community in Etawah to lay the foundation stone of a hospital during the SP regime.

This apart, the SP had laid its hands on Christian properties and St Maguz Church in Lucknow was locked by the government under the same regime.

Commenting on the cold response of various political organisations on atrocities against Christians, Dewendra Singh cited the instance of Maswanpur in Kanpur on March 17, 1998 in which anti-social elements disturbed a religious meeting of the community and set ablaze the pandal.

The delegates attending the meeting had a word of caution for the political outfits trying to whip up passions of protest against Para incident for vested interests.

Prominent among those who attended the meeting included northern region secretary of AICPF Rev Qamar Joy Zaidi, regional president of the All India Christian Association Dr George Jolly Sagar, Priest Rev B Mantoday, Rev Deepak Morris from Kanpur, William Aliver and Edwin Harmain of Bareilly, Ms Marry Ruth of Pilibhit, JA Turner of Badaun, Dr S Soloman, Secretary YMCA LJ Bhatti, vice-president of All India Dalit Women Forum Elizabeth Sindhu, Ainas Massey of Nainital, Pastor M Bilfard of Unnao, principal of Christ Church College, Kanpur, GK Lal, Father JW Adams of Epy Fenny Church in Lucknow, Father Samuel John of Jankipuram, Father George Verghese and Father Johnson of Etawah, Luke Samson of Meerut, Dr BN Kurian of Ghaziabad, president of India National Christian Association IC Tunis and AS Stainly who is the chairman of Indian Christian Educational and Welfare Society of Rupadiha in Bahraich.

Those attending the meeting unanimously condemned the act of John Augustine stating that it was because of such persons that the Christian minority was being targeted by different political and religious groups at will and demanded stringent action against all those who held the city and the railway passengers at ransom during the protest in Para on Monday last.

11,One-man panel to probe violence in PU,"CHANDIGARH: Panjab University has constituted a one-man high powered inquiry commission headed by former high court judge S K Jain to probe into the ""murderous attack"" on Malwinder Singh Kang, president of Panjab University Students Council (PUSU), allegedly by SOPU''s Khushbaz Singh Jattana, on July 30.

Even though eyewitnesses claimed that they saw Jattana and few other members of the SOPU party attacking Kang and three others in the university market, some SOPU supporters claimed that the allegations were baseless.

""This independent inquiry would look into all those aspects and try to find the exact cause,"" said senior official of the university told Times News Network.

The constitution of the committee was demanded by the PUSU in a press conference on Friday. Meanwhile, Chandigarh police is also on the lookout for Jattana, who is absconding.

The university has appealed to all students to get their comments registered with assistant registrar DSW, Haridasan, so that all aspects of the case can be probed.

The university has also formed a disciplinary committee, to be headed by dean, student welfare, Prof Nirmal Singh, to keep a check on the instances of indiscipline on the campus.

The decisions of the committee, which is a syndicate sub-committee, would be taken in anticipation of the approval of the syndicate and the power to rusticate a student has also been given to the committee.

In addition to the university hostel wardens, dean university instruction R J Hans Gill, DSW (women) Meenakshi Malhotra, and two student representatives (after they have been elected) and some legal experts would also be a part of the disciplinary committee.

""This is for the first time that such a committee has been constituted. There is a provision in the calendar under which the university can have such a committee. We have exploited that provision,"" said DSW Nirmal Singh.

12,Suicides by farmers on rise in north Karnataka,"HUBLI: Increasing debts and failure of crop have forced three farmers to commit suicide during the last 24 hours in Dharwad district. This takes the toll of suicide deaths by farmers in the district to 20 since April this year.

Arjun Dhyamappa Odeyar (35) committed suicide by hanging himself at his residence in Malligevad Village in Dharwad Taluk on Sunday morning. According to his family, Arjun had fourteen acres of agricultural land but he resorted to the drastic step following failure to repay agricultural debts to the tune of Rs 1 lakh.

In Uppinabettageri, a 31-year-old farmer Nigangowda Kallangowda Patil committed suicide by consuming a pesticide on Saturday night. Patil, who owned four acres, was desperate owing to failure of three consecutive crops and heavy debts.

Similarly, Basappa Mallappa Shirkol (55) had taken the extreme step on July 31 by consuming poison. However, he breathed his last on Saturday night. And again, the mounting debts provoked him to commit suicide, claim the family members.

With this, an alarming situation grips in the region with the hapless farmers resorting to suicide to put an end to their misery and penury.

After three years of crop failures due to successive droughts, farmers saw an opportunity to recoup their losses by going in for a bumper crop this year amidst initial signs of a good monsoon. However, it has turned out to be same old story for them.

Also, when over 150 farmers committed suicide in Karnataka between 1999 and 2002, a great deal of attention was drawn to these events in the initial phases, primarily through the media. More recently, however, it appears that suicides of farmers have become part of regular news, generating neither public outrage nor governmental response.

In July 2003 alone, about seven farmers committed suicide in different areas of North Karnataka, besides the controversial suicide of six girls belonging to a farmer''s family in Koppal recently.

A widely noted factor in the current rural distress appears to be the kind of credit that is available to poor farmers not through rural banks but through moneylenders, who are highly extortionist in nature and where interest rates are as high as 70 per cent per annum.

Echoing on this, farmer leader Baba Gouda Patil said, ""Those who committed suicide in various districts of North Karnataka in recent weeks had similar problems. They all were in despair owing to huge debts. The State government could not come to their rescue and the crop insurance scheme failed to mitigate their financial difficulties""

Opposition leader in the Karnataka legislative assembly Jagadish Shettar added the State government has adopted an indifferent attitude towards families of farmers who committed suicide by refusing to pay them ex-gratia of Rs 1 lakh each, as they say it would encourage more farmers to commit suicide.

In the absence of government assistance, he said the victims'' families are left in the lurch and driven to more desperation on account of financial hardships.

Dharwad district minister K N Gaddi, however, claims that the State government has been doing its utmost for the farmers. Moreover, farmers who suffered losses last year due to drought were provided compensation under the crop insurance scheme.

However, the opposition leaders dispute the minister''s claims. According to them, only 20 per cent of farmers in the region are covered under crop insurance. Moreover, the method of calculating the losses is defective. The compensation works out to Rs 250 per acre whereas the investment works out to Rs 2,500 per crop season, they added.

15,Student elections find favour with PU senators,"CHANDIGARH: Even though the democratic process of electing a student leader in Panjab University comes with a tale of violence and enmity, yet it finds favours with many on the campus. After all it is the democracy that rules, despite the apparent mockery of it as the student are ready to kill one another to assume power.

""Politics should be there on the campus as it is a nurturing ground for the future leaders. But violence and academics are a mismatch. Students should be mature enough not to get into petty politics but should use this platform for their further growth, said senator Prof PP Arya. Contrary to being discouraged by the evils of politics spreading in the campus, university fellows show resentment that the colleges in Punjab affiliated to this university do not get the opportunity to choose their leaders as the Punjab government does not allow such a process in the state. ""We are in for spreading democracy. PU has done well to revive the concept of student elections in 1997. Punjab government should follow and give students an opportunity to raise a voice in the decision-making process, said senator Charanjit Chawla.

Law and order problems are elections legacy. And assistance of UT police and Chandigarh administration to the autonomous university is a way out to deal with the problem every year. PU every time awaits the approval of the administration for the conduct of elections.

""If the UT Administrator says no then university cannot hold elections. But the norm has been that if the university really wants to have elections on the campus then administration always gives a green signal, said a senior university professor. Panjab University still has to get a nod from the administration to go ahead with the elections on the campus. But violence raises a question mark on the maturity and the seriousness of the university''s political leaders. Senators say here it is a fight of getting the power to throw your weight around and not of ideologies. ""Political leaders either enter serious politics or become hard-core criminals. This has been the general trend among the leaders. It is not a fight of ideology but purely of power,"" remarked a senator without wanting to be named.

17,SC notice to govt for treatment to AIDS patients,"NEW DELHI: Concerned with the plight of AIDS patients who were allegedly neglected by government hospitals, the Supreme Court on Monday issued notices to the Centre, all states, the National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) and all Union Territories.

The Voluntary Health Association of Punjab (VHAP) filed a public interest petition saying AIDS patients were not given treatment in any government hospitals and ""simply left to die"".

A Bench of Chief Justice V N Khare and Justice S B Sinha asked the respondents to file their replies within four weeks.

VHAP''s counsel Colin Gonsalves said that India had an estimated 55 lakh HIV infected persons, mostly poor.

Referring to the UN and World Bank statistics, VHAP said that it had been projected that by 2015 India was likely to become the HIV/AIDS capital of the world having a infected population of 350 lakh people.

Referring to emergency treatment measures taken by various Third World countries like Brazil to reduce their projected AIDS patients by half, the petitioner said India had the pharmaceutical edge over all these countries.

Of the 12 drugs recommended by WHO to fight the AIDS virus, 10 were manufactured by Indian pharma companies, the petitioner said, adding due to absence of demand from the government hospitals, Indian companies were on the verge of abandoning their research on anti-AIDS medicines.

Warning that almost everyone was at risk of contracting AIDS, the petitioner said the government must take up treatment aspect in the fold of its AIDS policy.

""As things stand today, a poor HIV positive person requiring hospitalisation and drugs, receives no treatment in any public hospital and is simply left to die,"" the petition maintained.

It sought a direction to the governments to recognise and implement the right of the AIDS patients to treatment and health as their Fundamental Right and provide free and equitable access to Anti Retro Viral (ARV) treatment to the HIV positive patients.

With the administration of the ARV drugs, a HIV positive person could now get a remarkably enhanced lifespan, Gonsalves said.

18,Badal to court arrest with 42 MLAs,"CHANDIGARH: In an effort to build counter pressure on the Amarinder Singh government, former Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal announced here on Monday that he, along with his 42 MLAs, would offer to court arrest in Chandigarh on September 5 to protest against the Congress government''s policies.

Badal, after holding deliberations at the political affairs committee of the Shiromani Akali Dal and a round of meeting with all SAD MLAs at the Kalgidhar Niwas here on Monday, would highlight the murder of democracy that took place during the Congress rule as also the repression unleashed on the SAD leaders.

In addition Badal has called Central leaders like Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani, Defence Minister Geroge Fernandes, Human Resources minister Murli Manohar Joshi and Law minister Arun Jaitley to address the Shiromani Akali Dal public meetings in days to come. Fernandes is scheduled to participate in the SAD''s ""rakad punya"" rally at Baba Bakala in Amritsar district on August 12 and Advani, along with others, would be attending the SAD meeting in Longowal village in Sangrur district on August 20.

He said the state was witnessing an absolute break-down of law and order situation where even officers of inspector general rank were feeling insecure. The Amarinder Singh government, he said, had bartered away the interests of Punjab as had been evident the way disinvestment in the Punjab Tractors Ltd was carried out and the work on the Bathinda oil refinery obstructed by the state government. Badal said it was under a well-planned conspiracy that the state government had compromised the interests of Punjab.

19,Sow new technology into farms: Expert,"PUNE: Agricultural scientist M S Swaminathan, who is better known as the father of green revolution in India, has stressed on the importance of developing a symbiotic partnership between the private sector and resource-poor farmers in bridging the gap between potential and actual yeilds, and in adding economic value to thwe time spent in agricultural labour.

Delivering the first Prof B D Tilak memorial lecture on Science And Sustained Agricultural Progress at the National Chemical Laboratory here on Monday, Swaminathan â€” the Unesco chair in ecotechnology â€” emphasised on the need to have a well-defined policy to eliminate the yeild gap.

""There are three basic areas in science and technology (gene technology/information and communication technology/ ecotechnology revolution) that will influence agricultural technology in a fundamental manner,"" he said.

Underlining the need to attract as well retain the youth in farming, he said practical achievements in bringing about the desired paradigm shift will depend upon public policy support and political action, regulation through legislation, social mobilisation throug local level communit organisations, and education through mass media will all be needed to meet the dual demands for food and ecological security.

Calling upon the scientific community to translate works for public good, Swaminathan said, ""Every scieitist working at the laboratory should question oneself as to what is s/he working for? Definitely not for a few publications alone.""

20,Student’s suicide hits Metro services again,"KOLKATA: Yet another suicide led to the disruption in Metro Railway services in Kolkata for more than one and a half hours on Monday morning. A number of trains were cancelled or rescheduled.

Office goers had a harrowing experience as die to the monsoon, the Metro Railway now runs with more passengers than usual. Normal service could be resumed at around 1.08 pm.

A Metro railway spokesman said a 22-year-old youth jumped on the track before the approaching Tollygunge bound train at Shyambazar Metro Station. The driver noticed it and immediately applied the emergency brake. But it was too late. The unidentified youth was already hit by then.

Services in the down line was suspended as the supply of electricity to the third raid was discontinued. The frequency of services in the up line was increased, yet it was hardly any solution to the plight passengers suffered during the day. The body was moved to the morgue.

Meanwhile, the Metro emerged as the city''s top suicide hotspot with 13 death out of 25 attempts on the Metro track in 2002. In 2003, already six persons attempted suicide, three died on the spot. So far, 44 people died on the Metro track since inception, out of 104 attempts.

Significantly, since its inauguration in October 24, 1984 till July 13, 1987, the Metro Railway had not experienced a single suicide.

Metro Railway had started playing music to sooth the nerves of the passengers and thus dissuading them from taking any drastic step like committing suicide. ""We actually tried to create an atmosphere where a commuter would feel better. We are yet to know whether it works on the mind of the commuters,"" a senior Metro Railway officer said.

24,CPI to intensify agitation against govt's anti-people policies,"HYDERABAD: The Communist Party of India (CPI) has decided to intensify its agitational programmes against the government''s anti-people policies, neglect of the Telangana region and immediate implementation of the one crore sops.

CPI state secretary Suravaram Sudhakar Reddy, talking to reporters on Monday, alleged that the chief minister was identifying beneficiaries to suit the party''s interests and said that the sheer number of applications received during during the janmabhoomi has left the government baffled.

Reddy said that the party would conduct mandal-level awareness meetings for five days beginning August 20, seeking immediate implementation of the one crore sops announced by the state government in an unbiased and free manner. These awareness meetings would highlight the hidden agenda of the ruling party in announcing the one crore sops, he said.

The decision, taken during the state executive held in the city, comes in the wake of allegations that applications for financial benefits were being processed as per the requests of the ruling party leaders and not according to the needs of the poor.

He said that a 15-day padayatra would be taken up from September 9 to highlight the pending irrigation projects in Telangana region and also demand the announcement of a Rs 5,000-crore special package for the development of Telangana region. A massive rally would be held in the city on October 9 demanding speedy implementation of G.O. 610 and to undo the injustice done to the people of Telangana.

The CPI executive also decided to press for the revival of Azam Jahi mills, withdrawal of interest free benefit to GMR group for the constructing international airport, sale of land to TCS at a subsidised rate, waive off interest on farm loans, proper implementation of the crop insurance scheme in drought-affected areas, stop shifting of the Anantagiri sanatorium at Vikarabad and abolish G.O.90 that paves way for the privatisation of medical and health care in the state.

25,Cong reads signs of early polls in Advani statement,"NEW DELHI: Signs of early Lok Sabha polls are what the Congress leadership reads in Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani''s statement about simultaneous Lok Sabha and Assembly elections.

In the first five polls scheduled in November, the Congress is in power in four states and it feels it has more than a fighting chance in all the five. So, it claims that the BJP is nervous about the Assembly poll results and hence has announced simultaneous elections.

The Congress leaders say the proposal per se is `ridiculous'' because the newly elected Assemblies like Gujarat and J&K could not be dismissed. Also, to synchronise the terms of Assemblies and Parliament forever, a fixed tenure would have to be imposed which is against the grain of the Constitution.

Party''s parliamentary affairs committee met on Monday morning to discuss the issue and would meet again in the evening to formulate party''s views on this issue.

Meanwhile, the party has decided to welcome any move to `reduce poll expenditure, holding up of development work'' and other arguments that would appeal to the middle class constituency.

The party''s official position articulated by spokesman Satyavrat Chaturvedi is that the Congress is ready for early Lok Sabha elections and is also open to the idea of simultaneous polls: ``But Advani should have taken into confidence his allies and talked to other parties first before making a public statement.""

Yet, the leadership feels that the BJP wants to hold Assembly elections in nine states: Delhi, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Mizoram, Andhra Pradesh, Orissa, Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh along with the polls. The first five are scheduled for November, but Andhra Pradesh, Orissa and Jharkhand are to be held next year and UP only in 2007.

``I think what Advani meant was that all those elections that are to be held within six months to one year prior or after the scheduled dates of Lok Sabha polls would be held together,"" said Congress chief whip Priyaranjan Dasmunshi.

He pointed out that the government would need to bring in a Constitutional amendment because Delhi and Rajasthan Assemblies'' life expires in December and that of Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh in January. According to a recent Supreme Court order, elections have to be conducted within five years of the completion of Assemblies'' terms.

Also, the Congress calculation is that Advani would not have made this statement without even talking to Chandrababu Naidu and Navin Patnaik. Hence, the Congress feels that Naidu and Patnaik are willing to advance polls to face a national election rather than fight on local issues. Naidu has been in power for almost seven years and Patnaik would complete his first term next year.

26,Govt assures protection of delta farmers interest,"GUNTUR: The state government has assured that the interests of the farmers of delta area in the district will be protected. Responding to the request by the health minister Kodela Sivaprasada Rao, the chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu had ordered the release of another 600 cusecs of water to the Krishna Western delta.

Sivaprasada Rao met the chief minister on Monday and appraised the cropping situation to him at Hyderabad.

Later, talking to reporters here over phone, the minister said that 400 cusecs of water would be immediately released in addition to the present releases of 1200 cusecs. He said that the government is committed to protect the delta farmers'' interests and sincerely monitoring the situation from time to time.

He appealed to the farmers not to waste the water as there were no sufficient reserves in the reservoirs. He said that the water additionally released into the KW canal would benefit the farmers in raising the seedbeds to some extent.

However, he cautioned the farmers not to take it for granted on the release of water for Khariff as it could be possible only when there were sufficient flows into the Nagarjunasagar. He urged the farmers not to be mislead by the provocations of the opposition leaders.

27,Air-hostesses for age rule review,"NEW DELHI: The Air-India air hostesses union said on Monday that they would seek a review of the recent Supreme Court judgment which brought down their flying age from 58 to 50 years. Terming it unreasonable and discriminatory, the union''s counsel Ram Jethmalani said: ''''In another couple of days, a revision petition against the apex court judgment on the issue would be filed.'''' The SC had on July 11 set aside a Bombay High Court judgment allowing the Air-India air hostesses to fly till their superannuation age at 58 years.

The former law minister claimed that the government had supported the petition of the air hostesses in the High Court against the discrimination they faced but in the special leave petition (SLP) in the apex court they had opposed the judgment. ''''There was contradiction in the government''s attitude before the Supreme Court and High Court. The present attitude amounts to Talibanising the air services in India,'''' he said contending that it was gross discrimination on the ground of sex where women are being treated as an object of exploitation.

Jethmalani said he had taken up the issue with the new aviation minister, who heard the grievances of the air hostess'' delegation with ''''attention and sympathy''''. Jethmalani said the petition committee of Parliament must unanimously remove such discrimination and revert to the government directive of October 1989, under which air hostesses were equated with the male cabin crew members and allowed to perform in-flight duties till the age of 58.

Stating that the ball was now in the government''s court, he said that if the discrimination were to continue, it would be an insult to the memory of late prime minister Rajiv Gandhi, who had supported the directive. The government, he added, will do justice by reversing the order and assigning flight duties to women till their retirement age.

28,BJP rebels' number increasing: Ajit,"LUCKNOW: Rashtriya Lok Dal President Ajit Singh on Monday said the dissident and disgruntled BJP MLAS were in touch with him. They had met him in Delhi, Udaipur and Lucknow.

Without specifying their number, Singh said initially the number of dissident MLAs stood at 22 and, as far as his information went, their number had swelled and not decreased. The existing situation did not warrant a fall in the dissident activities, he added.

Replying to mediapersons, Singh refused to answer whether there was any move to bring a vote of no-confidence against speaker Keshari Nath Tripathi in the budget session set to begin on August 28. He said a plan had been drawn by the main Opposition parties at their meeting on August 1, and it was Rashtriya Kranti Party President Kalyan Singh who had been authorised to tell the details.

In response to another query, Singh said his party MLAs were in their constituencies. The RLD President, who was here in connection with a ""sammelan"" of sugarcane growers, had been in the news lately following reports that some BJP dissidents had established contact with him and had met him collectively as well as individually. The reports gained momentum following the August 1 meeting of the opposition leaders.

29,Ludhiana rally fiasco: CM rushes to Delhi,"CHANDIGARH: Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh is rushing to New Delhi after the fiasco at the Ludhiana rally of the Panchayati Raj Institutions representatives, has given rise to speculations that he has been summoned by the party central leadership.

Acording to sources, the CM would stay there on Tuesday and the scheduled meetings here have been cancelled.

The dissidents are trying to cash in on the casual attitude of the chief minister over the serious issues like delegation of the powers to the PRIs and local bodies, as reflected by his leaving the rally, after making his own remarks.

They point out the CM had not waited even to listen to the main speaker Mani Shankar Aiyer, who is chairman of the AICC cell of political training department.

What has irked the main guest was that Amarinder''s departure from the venue was a signal for the gathering to melt away and many senior leaders too left the place.

""This was certainly embarrassing for Aiyer, who instead of dwelling upon the issue cut it short,'' said a Congress leader pointing out that the issue of delegation of powers is close to the heart of the party chief Sonia Gandhi.

The dissidents maintain that Amarinder Singh is summoned to Delhi, but there was no official confirmation of the same. ""Perhaps, he had some meeting and the chief secretary would join him on Tuesday,"" explained an official.

Speculations apart, a larger number of party legislators, including some ministers are upset over the style of functioning of the CM and his one point programme of attacking his predecessor Parkash Singh Badal.

They are convinced that his one point approach would boomerang on the party itself. To Amarinder''s advantage, there is no epicentre of dissidence and there was no identified dissident group. However, the disenchantment with him is wide spread.

The Congress legislators are worried over the dwindling support base of the party, because of the government''s policies, which have created wide resentment. The unprecedented fee hike in colleges, which was subsequently rolled back, abolition of NPA of the government doctors and imposing sales tax on the CSD sales to serving and ex-servicemen. On all these decisions, the party had not been consulted and majority of legislators were opposed to it.

30,Cong ready to face simultaneous polls,"BANGALORE: Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee president B.Janardhana Poojary said the party was ready to face simultaneous polls to the Lok Sabha and Legislative Assembly.

""The yatra would include tableaux and performances by cultural troupes highlighting the state''s achievements. All ministers, MLAs, MLCs, MPs, chairmen of boards and corporations, BCC Mayor, corporators, municipal corporation, district panchayat and taluk panchayat chiefs have been asked to contribute one month''s salary for the yatra.

31,BJP stalled release of food grains: Cong,"BANGALORE: Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee president B Janardhana Poojary on Monday accused the BJP of stalling the Centre''s move to release additional foodgrains to the state during drought.

Speaking to reporters, he said: ""I know some people from the BJP asked the Centre not to release additional foodgrains. A letter has also gone to the Centre.""

Poojary was reacting to allegations levelled by BJP about irregularities in foodgrain distribution and that Congress party workers and legislators had stocked foodgrains in their houses.

The Congress is prepared to take action against the guilty. Stringent action would be initiated against party workers guilty of siphoning off foodgrains and election tickets would be denied to such persons.

But, the opposition should come forward with specific instances of irregularities.

33,BJP wants NHRC to look into farmers suicides,"BANGALORE: BJP''s Karnataka unit will file a petition with the National Human Rights Commission against the state government''s ""callousness"" and ""apathy"" in providing drought-relief leading to suicides of over 300 farmers.

Party state president Ananth Kumar told reporters here on Monday, after a visit to to M. Rampur in Kustagi taluk, Koppal, where six members of a family committed suicide: ""The situation there is pathetic. Even little girls have to do stone-breaking work, if they want to eat.""

Kumar said the state had provided only seven days of work in the last six months in the area under the food-for-work programme, for which the Centre had released 7.25 lakh metric tonnes of foodgrains.

""There should have been at least 60 days of work. But there has been a huge amount of misappropriation, only about 50 per cent of the foodgrains have reached those for whom it was meant,"" he maintained.

Kumar said he would personally petition the NHRC, after witnessing the huge amount of corruption in the drought relief measures. ""Each of the 153 drought-hit taluks should have got 500 truckloads of foodgrains of which at least two to three truckloads should have reached every village. Where are these?"" he asked.

On the Rs 1 lakh compensation that the state government announced for farmers who committed suicide, Kumar said: ""The chief minister announced this in the budget. The revenue minister has gone on record that 169 farmers have committed suicide. Why has the compensation not been released for these people at least?""

Kumar said he had released Rs 25,000 from the party to the kin of the six who committed suicide in Koppal. ""We have also released another Rs 25,000 towards a gangji (gruel) centre at the village. The state government should actually do this, but we want to do our duty as a political party,"" he added.

34,SPIC MACAY's new steps include food programme,"MUMBAI: Even the most tenacious grandmothers sometimes get flustered by discouragement. SPIC MACAY (Society for the Promotion of Indian Classical Music and Culture Among Youth), which has been playing grandmother to Indian youth for 26 years, is no different.

So, recently, when the society approached Kishori Amonkar to perform at their national convention in Mumbai in 2004, and she said that SPIC MACAY was only fighting ""a losing battle"", it stopped to rethink. It has now come up with a strengthened game plan.

""It''s a tough battle against lollipop culture and perhaps I''ll need another 26 years to get results, but I still want to fight,"" says Kiran Seth, founder-director, SPIC MACAY,who is in Mumbai to announce the national convention of 2004. It will be returning to the city after 12 years.

""When I''m depressed, I feel I''m losing. But then, when I see some student actually stopping to think about Indian heritage, despite living in today''s rushed, mechanical times, I feel encouraged.""

SPIC MACAY''s new initiatives include a holistic food programme for children, a community outreach programme, adoption of villages (their Nagpur chapter has already adopted two villages) and the introduction of Indian heritage studies in middle school.

""The ministry of information and technology has given us funding to develop a model of Indian heritage studies for seventh, eighth and ninth standard students,"" he says.

""It''ll be an elective course of 20 lessons, designed with games and animation to make them lively. We''ll introduce the pilot project in a Delhi school in two months, and then pass the model around the country.""

For its community outreach programme, SPIC MACAY has approached the BMC for help. This programme was started recently in Delhi with the support of the New Delhi Municipal Corporation.

Cultural programmes were conducted in Delhi''s local parks and slum areas for the public. In Mumbai, they intend to start off with Dharavi.

""We thought of the holistic food programme because we noticed that children are becoming obese today by eating the wrong foods,"" says Mr Seth. ""We''ve set up a pilot project in a couple of schools in Delhi, where we''ve convinced the principals to send their school cook to our holistic food experts. So far, they''ve given us a ''letter of intent'' to serve holistic food in their mess. Depending on how this works out, we will initiate the movement countrywide.""

35,LF adds rally to tax burden on residents,"KOLKATA: Political parties of different hues are poised to go on an overdrive in Kolkata following a series of legislations in the state assembly, empowering the state government to collect taxes of different kinds in urban and rural areas.

Residents may suffer as a result in the coming days.

For opposition parties like the Trinamul Congress, suffering from reverses like defeat in the panchayat poll and its leader Mamata Banerjee missing a berth in the Union cabinet, the increases in taxes have provided an opportunity.

After last Fridayâ€™s street corner meetings disrupting traffic all over the city, on Monday Trinamul Congress activists held demonstrations in front of different police stations in the city, demanding reduction in taxes and also protested against increase in fees in educational institutions and introduction of capitation fee for medical education. The protest was, however, peaceful.

Trimamul Congress general secretary Mukul Roy said the Trinamul steering committee would meet on August 9 to chalk out the next phase of agitation of the party on the same issue.

The Pradesh Congress Committee on Sunday announced the programme for a siege of Writers Buildings, the state secretariat, on September 11 on the same issue of increase in taxes. Large-scale disruptions in traffic were feared on that day as the Congress was planning to mobilise supporters from the districts.

On Monday, the Left Front announced a series of programmes this month, though under a different pretext, the policies of the NDA government at the Centre, which, according to LF chairman Biman Bose, were pushing the country to the clutches of imperialists and threatening the economic freedom of the country.

Bose parried the question, however, when asked if the programmes of the LF were to counter those announced by its political adversaries, the Trinamul and the Congress. â€œWe did not discuss programmes of other political parties in the LF meeting,â€� Bose said.

LF would observe the coming Independence day as â€œanti-imperialist and anti-communalist dayâ€�, with a centralised meeting in the city, Bose said. From August 16 to August 31, there would be a series of programmes against the ill effects of the â€œnew economic policiesâ€� of the NDA government, he said. On August 31, there would be a series of programmes, including a rally at Subodh Mullick Square, on the issue of the food movement of 1959.
