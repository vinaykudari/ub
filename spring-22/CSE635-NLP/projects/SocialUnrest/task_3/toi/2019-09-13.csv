0,MPs can fund water projects: minister,"MUMBAI: Minister of state the Prime Ministers Office (PMO) Vijay Goyal on Wednesday said state MPs can fully fund the water supply projects in their constituencies without making the people pay the mandatory 10 per cent towards the capital cost of the project.

â€œThis is being done in keeping with the popular demand of the MPs who pointed out that in many hamlets the locals are not in position to bear 10 per cent of the project cost. In such cases we have directed that the entire water supply project will be funded by the MPs local area development funds (MPLAD),â€™â€™ Mr Goyal said at a press conference held at Sahyadri, the state guest house in Malabar Hill.

The announcement, however, defeats the very purpose the state government which had last year insisted on greater community participation in piped water schemes. It had made it mandatory on the consumers to bear 10 per cent of the expenses of the project and aimed to involve the locals in the planning, implementation and maintenance of the water supply schemes.

In fact, the policy of 10 per cent popular participation in water supply projects mooted by the Union government which had then directed the states to implement it. â€œThe new decision will not defeat the policy of greater community participation. We have said that wherever the project costs is high and the locals are not able to fund the 10 per cent the entire project will be funded from the MPs funds,â€™â€™ said Mr Goyal who is also the minister of state for statistic and programme implementation.

Earlier, Mr Goyal met chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh and pointed out the various administrative bottlenecks in the utilisation of MPLAD funds.

1,"Polls a battle for humanity, Vaghela tells partymen","VADODARA: For the Congress, Gujarat elections are more than a mere battle of the ballot, with state party president Shankarsinh Vaghela asking his partymen to view it as a â€œbattle for humanityâ€�.

Addressing party ex-MLAs and workers from Central Gujarat at a political training camp here on Thursday, Vaghela said the Assembly elections will be much more than just a fight between the BJP and the Congress.

â€œThe issue concerns the whole world. For, the issue this time is not just a few seats but that of humanity,â€� said Vaghela.

â€œThe entire country will be watching our performance with bated breath as they see us as a side fighting for the cause of humanity,â€� he added, asking Congressmen to rise above selfish motives to work for the party.

Talking more like a management guru than a political leader, Vaghela told the gathering to realise the worth of the â€œCongress brandâ€�. He also called for a mindset change where Congress workers need to work with an open mind and as a close-knit team.

â€œIt is almost certain that polls will be conducted in early December, and we are on our way to Gandhinagar,â€� he told a huge gathering of Congress men at the Gandhi Nagargruh here.

He exhorted party workers to work as a team. â€œThere is no party today that works as a team. We have been working as a team for years. You must remember that people do not stamp on your name but on the party symbol. Get it out of your heads that you area neta and go to the people. There are numerous floating around you. From electricity to water supply problems, there are so many issues to be picked up,â€� Vaghela said.

Earlier, talking to the media, Vaghela alleged that corruption has risen by over 40 per cent and that his findings were based on the rising number of cases with the Lok Pal.

â€œThe BJP should move out on moral grounds as soon as the six-month period is over. They are misusing government machinery for furthering their interests,â€� he alleged.

2,Child development policy unveiled,"MUMBAI: Chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh on Thursday unveiled a comprehensive Child Development Policy to address issues such as child health, education, child care, substance abuse and juvenile justice, among others.

With a special focus on the tribal sector, the ambitious programme seeks to tackle issues right from the pre-natal stage upto 18 years. It also provides for health care and nutrition for expectant mothers.

There are plans for setting up a first-of-itskind Child Rights Commission, on the lines of the Human Rights Commission, announced Mr Deshmukh at a press conference in Mantralaya on Thursday.

â€œThe commission will be essentially to safeguard the rights of the children,â€™â€™ the chief minister said. Efforts will also be made to arrest the trend of child marriages and ensure strict implementation of the Child Marriages Restraint Act.

â€œA primary-level officer in every village block across the state will be entrusted with the additional responsibility of stopping such practises. He will be specially designated as a child marriage prevention officer,â€™â€™ Mr Deshmukh said.

The chief minister said that presently the state spends around Rs 550 crore on various schemes meant for development of children and that the budgetary allocation will be annually increased by 10 per cent every year.

3,Mahajan blasts Pakistan for disrupting J&K polls,"MUMBAI: â€œA ballot for every peace-loving Kashmiri and a bullet for every terrorist trying to subvert the election process must be the determination with which all Indians have to fight terrorism,â€™â€™ Union communications minister Pramod Mahajan said as he inaugurated a photo exhibition to mark the first anniversary of the attacks on New Yorkâ€™s World Trade Centre and on the Pentagon.

Mr Mahajan said that the world has to be shown that Pakistan is responsible for spreading terrorism in India. â€œTerrorism is now acknowledged as a world phenomenon but the US and certain other countries have been supporting Pakistan for their own interests,â€™â€™ he said. â€œThey will rue this attitude some day since Pakistan is the fountainhead of terrorismâ€” be it in Afghanistan or in India.â€™â€™

The exhibition, Afghanistan: Trauma and Terror,â€™ organised by the Rambhau Mhalgi Prabodhini on rebuilding attempts in the war-ravaged country impressed Mr Mahajan. He said it was comforting to note that while the world had its attention riveted on New York where the first anniversary of 9/was being observed, there were some people who remembered Afghanistan.

Mr Mahajan said Afghanistan would have to adopt the path of peace if wanted to develop, progress and prosper like India. Shriram Vernekar Union communications minister Pramod Mahajan inaugurates a photo exhibition on Afghanistan in Mumbai on Wednesday on the the first anniversary of 9/11.

4,LeT suicide squad in J&K,"SRINAGAR: A fresh Laskhar suicidal group, comprising seven members, sneaked into the Kashmir Valley in August first week to disrupt the state assembly polls. The killing of the law minister on Wednesday was part of a plan chalked out by the outfit in co-ordination with the Hizbul Mujahideen, the Jaish-e-Mohammad and the Jamait-ul-Mujahideen militants last week, a senior security officer has said. The group has been sent to derail the election process, particularly in North Kashmir, where electioneering has gained new heights despite 15 years of militancy, the officer added. The seven-member group, headed by Rehamatullah of Pakistan, has dispersed and each member has been deputed with district commanders operating in the Valley, the officer said.

5,Most migrants will vote in J&K polls,"HIRANAGAR/JAMMU & KASHMIR: Unlike hundreds of migrants along the line of control (LoC), over 30,000 migrants along the 43-kilometre international border (IB) in Kathua districtâ€™s Hiranagar belt, are determined to vote despite the fear of Pakistani guns. â€˜â€˜We will take part in elections at any cost and under all circumstances. We will vote right under Pakistani artillery guns here, barely 500 meters away from Pak posts,â€™â€™ said Harbans Lal Mania sarpanch of the border panchayat, Kote Puna. The constituency goes to polls on October One. The people of the 14 villages, located on the on a tiny island facing Pakistan, have overcome the painful memory of the bombardment by Pak artillery gun that reduced one of the villages to ashes just three months back. â€˜â€˜The sound of dholaks and loudspeakers of the canvassing candidates have replaced the sound of mortars and gun shots,â€™â€™ said the sarpanch. â€˜â€˜We want to teach Pakistan what democracy is? We will reply to their bullets by ballots over Kashmir issue. Gun is not the solution, but Pakistan feels guns can do anything. Year after year they repeat Marshal law,â€™â€™ Nanak Chand a retired headmaster said. The migrants from 51 different border villages along the IB had fled towards the end of May after the military buildup and the Pakistani artillery bombardment which resulted in the death of eleven people, and left 47 injured. â€˜â€˜These people were later given shelter in 25 camps by the administration,â€™â€™ district election officer BD Sharma said. â€˜â€˜After spending nearly four months in tents and school accommodations, we have come back during last fortnight and are now busy in electioneering for different political parties,â€™â€™ said Bal Krishen Thapa president of forward village Krishenpur Kandi. The sarpanch added, â€˜â€˜We will vote for the political party, which will rehabilitate us at a safer place out of the range of Pakistni guns.â€™â€™ There are nearly 90 to 100 polling stations located along the IB and all of them have been declared hyper-sensitive, Sharma said while adding that necessary measures have been taken to safeguard people from shelling during polling.

6,SC order on syllabi vindicates govt stand: Joshi,"NEW DELHI: The academic community opposing the Vajpayee governmentâ€™s â€˜â€˜saffronisationâ€™â€™ policy in education appeared to realise its tactical mistake in moving court to seek annulment of the National Curriculum Framework for Secondary Education-2002, with the Supreme Court on Monday upholding the policy saying that there was â€˜â€˜no saffronisationâ€™â€™.

â€˜â€˜An intellectual and academic issue was taken to court and now it has got the legal stamp from the highest court,â€™â€™ a senior academician, closely associated with the campaign, told The Times of India, while requesting anonymity.

Some of the leading lights of the campaign, among them, Bipan Chandra, Romila Thapar, DN Jha, Arjun Dev and Indira Arjun Dev, said they would react only after studying the judgment. But HRD minister Murli Manohar Joshi, buoyed by the SC verdict, hit back at his detractors alleging that they were â€˜â€˜playing politics with educationâ€™â€™.

â€˜â€˜The SC has vindicated our stand. Those allegations (of saffronising education) hurled on us were politically motivated, mischievous or made out of ignorance,â€™â€™ an elated Joshi told mediapersons. He maintained that his policy was in consonance with the 1986 Education Policy.

7,Politics back in business after debate over disinvestment,"NEW DELHI: The disinvestment debate has brought politics back in business. Cabinet ministers have liberally used the media to air their differences over disinvestment in HPCL and BPCL, and Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani is concerned about the damage this could cause to the image of the NDA government and BJP in particular. With several states going to the polls over the next 10 months, he is in a hurry to correct the impression that the NDA government is a divided house. â€˜â€˜Ministers should function within the government,â€™â€™ he told his colleagues ahead of last Saturdayâ€™s cabinet committee meeting called to discuss the disinvestment issue. He added: â€˜â€˜Public criticism of colleagues over differences casts a shadow over the NDAâ€™s way of governance. We will be going to the people not in two years (when the Vajpayee government completes its term) but over the next 10 months.â€™â€™ Sources say that Advaniâ€™s reference was not just to disinvestment minister Arun Shourieâ€™s remark that his cabinet colleagues had â€˜â€˜ambushedâ€™â€™ him with their opposition but also to the general trend among cabinet ministers to air their differences in public. That there are deep differences is apparent from what transpired at the cabinet committee on disinvestment meeting. When Shourie raised the prospect of revenue shortfall in case the government opted for a public offer instead of strategic sale of HPCL and BPCL, finance minister Jaswant Singh said revenue generation was his business and not the disinvestment ministryâ€™s. HRD minister Murli Manohar Joshi said, â€˜â€˜Whatâ€™s the hurry? How much more do you want from this sector?â€™â€™ He was referring to the fact that the oil sector would contribute 60 per cent of the Rs 12,000 crore disinvestment target even without the sale of HPCL and BPCL. â€˜â€˜The government has promised one million jobs by 2010. How will we face the people if we keep selling profit-making organisations?â€™â€™ Joshi asked. Defence minister George Fernandes opposed the strategic sale route not only out of â€˜â€˜security concernsâ€™â€™ but also on social grounds. â€˜â€˜Strategic sale would only create centres of wealth. This will not go down well with the people. These companies were built with peopleâ€™s money. They should be returned to the people,â€™â€™ Fernandes said. Oil minister Ram Naik, who is opposed to strategic sale, commented that if the government was so divided within, perhaps there was a need to let voters decide whether they wanted privatisation.

8,KGMC doctors strike against lawyer's misbehaviour,"LUCKNOW: Junior doctors of the King Georgeâ€™s Medical College went on strike late on Thursday evening, demanding arrest of a lawyer who allegedly misbehaved with residents on duty on Wednesday morning. The junior doctors association, after a meeting, announced a 24-hour token strike and decided to meet on Friday evening. They threatened to go on an indefinite strike, if the lawyer was not arrested within 24 hours.

The lawyer, a resident of LDA colony, reportedly entered into heated arguments with the junior doctors on duty after his wife, who had been admitted at Gandhi memorial hospital, died during treatment. Blaming junior doctors for their â€˜gross negligenceâ€™, the lawyer entered into a verbal duel with them. Later, the two parties came to blows. Counter FIRs were lodged by both the parties in this connection.

Enraged over the behaviour of the lawyer, junior doctors convened a meeting on Thursday evening and demanded more security on the hospital campus.

9,Duttatrey rules out judicial probe into Rajdhani mishap,"PATNA: Junior railway minister Bangaru Duttatrey on Thursday avoided speculating on the reason behind the Rajdhani Express accident on Monday night, saying the commissioner of railway safety (CRS) has begun probe into it, but, like his senior Nitish Kumar, hinted at the possibility of sabotage. He ruled out a judicial inquiry into the incident.

He categorically said that the accident did not take place due to weak structure of the 86-year-old bridge on the Dhawa river. The said the bridge was not among the 526 â€˜distressâ€™ bridges located across the country. He said that despite the massive derailment, the bridge had not collapsed and the railway traffic on the route would resume by Thursday night. He also ruled out the possibility of the bridge being included in the list of â€˜distressâ€™ bridge, saying it was still strong.

Duttatrey said that the railway ministry did not propose to replace â€˜distressâ€™ bridges with new ones in the near future even though the central government had sanctioned Rs 17,000 crore as Special Railway Safety Fund (SRSF) and another Rs 15,000 crore for Rail Vikas Yojana.

As far as negotiating â€˜distressâ€™ bridges were concerned, the railway drivers had been asked to take precautionary measures, including slowing down the speed of the train while passing through the bridges. Besides, railway staff had been stationed near all the â€˜distressâ€™ bridges for monitoring.

The minister said that age could not determine the strength of a bridge.

â€œThere were only two ambulances in contrast to the dozens of ambassadors used by bureaucrats. Had it not been for the jawans and locals, rescue would have taken much longer, raising the toll,â€� fumed Mukherjee.

Still clueless as to who was in charge, Mukherjee added, â€œCo-ordination between officials and the administration was non-existent and information was inadequate.â€�

11,Judicial probe in Rajdhani mishap ruled out,"PATNA: Junior railway minister Bandaru Duttatrey on Thursday avoided speculating on the reason behind the Rajdhani Express accident on Monday night, saying the commissioner of railway safety (CRS) has begun probe into it, but, like his senior Nitish Kumar, hinted at the possibility of sabotage.

He ruled out a judicial inquiry into the incident.

He categorically said that the accident did not take place due to weak structure of the 86-year-old bridge on the Dhawa river. The said the bridge was not among the 526 â€˜distressâ€™ bridges located across the country. He said that despite the massive derailment, the bridge had not collapsed and the railway traffic on the route would resume by Thursday night. He also ruled out the possibility of the bridge being included in the list of â€˜distressâ€™ bridge, saying it was still quite strong. Replying to a query, Duttatrey said that the railway ministry did not propose to replace â€˜distressâ€™ bridges with new ones in the near future even though the central government had sanctioned Rs 17,000 crore as Special Railway Safety Fund (SRSF) and another Rs 15,000 crore for Rail Vikas Yojana.

As far as negotiating â€˜distressâ€™ bridges were concerned, the railway drivers had been asked to take precautionary measures, including slowing down the speed of the train while passing through the bridges. Besides, railway staff had been stationed near all the â€˜distressâ€™ bridges for constant monitoring.

The minister said that age could not determine the strength of a bridge. He disclosed that there were 51,340 bridges which were more than 100-year-old while 89,076 bridges were more than 60-year-old. He said that the very fact that two trains â€” an express and a goods train â€” had passed through the same track just a few minutes before the accident, indicated that the Rafiganj bridge was not weak. Both the trains were running at a speed of over 100-km an hour, he said.

Duttatrey said that except for the bogie K-3, the rescue teams had cleared all the bogies. He put the figure of injured at 209. He, however, admitted that the rescue operation launched by the railway left a lot to be desired as the railway ministry lacked skilled staff and sophisticated equipments. He said that the railway ministry had decided to set up a disaster management cell to improve the functioning of rescue teams. Relief operation also suffered due to difficult location of the incident site, he said.

Taking strong exception to the FIR lodged against railway officials by the Aurangabad district administration in connection with the accident, Duttatrey said that the state government was trying to politicise the whole issue. He said that while railway safety was the lookout of the railway ministry, passenger security was the responsibility of respective state governments. He said that disposing of the bodies or handing them over to their kin was responsibility of the state government.

12,Jailed leader throws a party in hospital,"KURNOOL: The Kurnool police have registered a case against Congress leader Gouru Venkata Reddy, a life-term convicted prisoner, for misusing the medical treatment facility at the Kurnool general hospital here on Wednesday night.

The doctors had confirmed that he was a patient of chronic gastric ulcer.

Reddy, who was shifted to the hospital when he complained of severe stomach pain, hosted a liquor party to his friends in the VIP suite allotted to him in the paying block of the hospital. He even paid an advance amount of Rs 10,000 for the suit.

On information, hospital superintendent K Ramachandra complained to the police that the Congress leader was misusing the hospital room by hosting a liquor party.

The police team, led by town CI Mallikarjuna raided his room on Wednesday midnight and seized a bottle of whisky, few biryani packets and playing cards. But, by the time they raided the room, Reddy was in the ''Police Sadan'', which is also located on the hospital premises, where ordinary prisoners undergo treatment.

The police found Reddy in a drunken state and the doctors also confirmed it.

District SP N Sanjay is contemplating action against the police personnel,who did not act though Reddy organised a party in the hospital room.

13,Oppn raps CM for retaining tainted ministers,"HYDERABAD: The minor cabinet reshuffle effected by chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu on Wednesday failed to convince the opposition about governmentâ€™s intention to check corruption at high places. The changes in the council of ministers evoked strong criticism from the opposition parties.

Speaking to reporters here on Wednesday, Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) president M Satyanarayana Rao said that though the cabinet reshuffle was a routine exercise and the prerogative of the chief minister, it showed that the government was bent on continuing with tainted ministers in the cabinet.

â€œWhile the chief minister sought the resignation of P Srinivas Reddy on ethical grounds, he did not adopt the same yardstick in the case of other ministers like Kodela Sivaprasada Rao, K E Prabhakar, Nagam Janardhan Reddy and K Subbarayudu, whose names also figured in the incidents of irregularities.â€�

He demanded that Naidu seek the resignations of other ministers whose names figure in the scandals.

Meanwhile, the CPM state committee said that the cabinet reshuffle would not help in removing corruption from the government nor would it enhance the administrative efficiency of the government.

CPM secretary BV Raghavulu, in a press release on Wednesday, said that the continuation of energy minister K Subbarayadu and minor irrigation minister K E Prabhakar in the cabinet shows the insincerity of Naidu in cleansing corruption from the administration.

14,Minister asks for hike in farm subsidies,"HYDERABAD: Agriculture minister Vadde Sobhanadreeswara Rao has called for increasing subsidies to farmers from present 3 per cent to 10 per cent.

Rao, who was delivering the inaugural address at a seminar on â€˜Foreign trade â€” Opportunities and challengesâ€™ here on Thursday, said developed nations were able to sell their products in a big way due to the huge subsidies the farmers enjoy in those countries.

These nations get away with this practice as they have lesser number of farmers compared to developing countries like India, he added.

The minister said even our economists were raising a hue and cry over the subsidies given to farmers. This, despite the Indian industry realising that it is getting more and more difficult to survive in a competitive world along with multi-national companies (MNCs).

Rao said the developed nations had framed rules, which were benefiting them and will continue to do so. The result is that there is no level playing field for developing nations, he added.

The dean of Indian Institute of Foreign Trade (IIFT) Prof. B Bhattacharya, who delivered the keynote address, said economists have to now answer what will happen to competitiveness if everyone has access to the same resources.

As globalisation strives to enhance competitiveness, this aspect has become a major topic of discussion among economists, he added. Bhattacharya said if globalisation is fully realised, then the movement of factors of production, mainly capital and technology, will become larger and smoother.

15,FFW sounds death knell for farmers,"HYDERABAD: The â€˜Food-for-Workâ€™ programme, seen as a panacea for drought by the government, has begun to sound the death knell for paddy farmers of the state, thanks to the FFW rice finding its way into the market.

With rice millers in various districts procuring FFW rice that is entering into the market either with the contractors of various FFW works selling the rice being â€˜paidâ€™ to them, or through the barter system, paddy from the previous Rabi season is no longer being bought by the millers.

â€œWith the FFW rice being recycled, the millers are not purchasing the paddy. All they are doing is polish the FFW rice and sell it to the Food Corporation of India (FCI),â€� Federation of Farmersâ€™ Associations president Dr Maganti Sita Rama Swamy told The Times of India.

One conservative estimate puts the recycled FFW rice could total up to a whopping 10 lakh tonnes.

The plight of the farmers, who have stored tens of thousands of tonnes of their unsold grain in the marketyard godowns, can be gauged by the fact that against the Rs 397 per 75-kg bag of ordinary quality paddy, the rate now varies between Rs 340 and Rs 350. Since this is uneconomical, the farmer has no option but to hold on to the stock in the hope of finding a market for his Rabi grain. â€œBut this is not going to happen,â€� explained Sita Rama Swamy.

â€œBecause when the crop from the current Kharif season comes in, it will lead to more selling pressure,â€� he said.

16,State home minister skips Cabinet meeting on law and order,"HYDERABAD: The absence of home minister T Devender Goud at a high-level law and order meeting convened by chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu on Thursday sparked speculation about the minister being unhappy after the cabinet expansion.

The home minister normally makes it a point to attend all meetings called by the chief minister, but failed to turn up for the meeting called to discuss the arrangements to be made for the Ganesha immersion ceremony in the city.

The home minister preferred to go on a surprise visit to Rangareddy district, said to have been arranged at the last minute, despite the scheduled meeting in the chief ministerâ€™s office (CMO), sources said. Normally, the CMO informs ministers and officers who are scheduled to attend the meetings a day in advance.

It is said the chief minister made inquiries about the absent minister soon after the cabinet meeting got underway. Sources said the home minister wanted the panchayat raj department, but this did not happen in the reshuffle, leading to Goudâ€™s unhappiness.

Municipal administration minister B V Mohan Reddy, who is said to be close to the home minister, met him in the evening, giving credence to the speculation. However, Naidu consulted Goud on the cabinet-making process and inducted N Anjaneyulu into the ministry on the recommendation of the home minister. Sources close to Naidu do not see any reason for Goudâ€™s unhappiness.

19,"NC, Cong in direct clash for Poonch seat","JAMMU: With battlelines drawn for the first phase of Assembly elections in Jammu and Kashmir on September 16, the border district of Poonch will witness ''one to one fight'' between the ruling National Conference and Congress in all the three constituencies.

Of the 17 candidates in the fray, NC, BJP and Congress had fielded their candidates in all the three constituencies, Poonch-Haveli, Mendhar and Surankote, where an electorate of 256,999 would exercise their franchise in 346 polling stations, district electoral officer, Poonch, Pawan Kotwal.

While six candidates are in the fray from Poonch-Haveli constituency, five are in Mendhar and six in Surankote. The main battle is between sitting MLA G M Jan of NC and Yashpaul Sharma of Congress in Poonch Haveli, Javed Rana (NC) and Zaffar-Ullah (Congress) in Mendhar and NC minister Mustaq Bukhari and Choudhary Mohammad Aslam (Congress) at Surankote.

In the 1996 Assembly elections, the NC won all the three seats on greater autonomy plank.

But this time, it may not be a cakewalk for the NC candidates as the anti-incumbency wave, alleged failure on the development front and issue of scheduled tribe status to Gujjars may give an edge to the opposition Congress, political observers say.

Besides, former Union minister Mufti Mohd Sayeed''s People''s Democratic Party had also fielded its candidates, making NC''s battle more difficult, they said.

""For NC, Poonch seats are important in terms of power balancing in the Hindu-dominated Jammu division and the Congress too has an eye on these,"" a prominent Gujjar leader Shamsher Hakla Poonch said.

For NC the star campaigners include party chief Omar Abdullah and state Chief Minister Farooq Abdullah, while for Congress, JKPCC chief Gulam Nabi Azad, AICC general secretary Ambika Soni and Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh.

21,"BJP's dual policy on Dargah land, slaughter houses exposed","RAJKOT: The BJP''s dual policy on important issues like the Geban Shah Pir Dargah and the party''s stand on slaughter house was exposed during the general board meeting of the Rajkot Municipal Corporation.

The general board meeting turned out to be a stormy event after allegations and counter allegations were freely made by members during the proceedings. Congress won hands down after the board decided to give the open land near the Geban Shah Pir Dargah to the Dargah trust. The BJP was opposing this allotment and had even termed the entire Darga as an illegal structure. The BJP members even stormed the well of the House to register their protest.

When the BJP said that they were registering their protest against giving away the land to the Dargah trust, the Rajkot city Congress president and Rajkot Mayor Ashok Dangar fished out a letter from the official files written by BJP leader of the opposition Lalubhai Parekh when he was deputy mayor. The letter was infact a recommendation, by Parekh, that the land be given to the Dargah Trust after taking the cost of the land.

Even as the BJP leaders stood their ground, the mayor summoned the town planning officer and asked him to explain the position. The town planning officer Rupani said that the plan for the Dargah was passed way back in 1989 when BJP was in power. In the end the proposal was passed with the Dargah having to pay Rs 100 per square meter for the land allotment.

The minority leaders in the general board also took strong exception to the utterances made by leader of the BJP, Dhansukh Bhanderi, at the proccedings. The minority leaders sought an apology from Bhanderi for using unparliamentary language and terming the Dargah as an illegal building.

However the protests soon turned their attention to the issue of the slaughter houses. Parekh said they had always objected to opening of new slaughter houses in the city. However the winds were taken of the BJP protests when the Mayor reminded Parekh that it was he who had inaugurated a non-vegetarian restaurant in the city. The Mayor also submitted photographs of the restaurant opening, as evidence.

The minister said the BJP-led government had allocated 2.2 crore telephone connections since it came to power which was more than the total allotment of phones in the past 50 years.

Paswan said the communication ministry had began a survey of the great sons of the soil who contributed much to freedom and social struggles. Alluding to the Congress, he said, unlike the governments of the past, the BJP government wanted an honest examination of the social reformers. Ayyankali was an example.

23,Jains apologise for Gujarat communal riots,"AHMEDABAD: A section of Amdavadis recently apologised for the communal riots that had gripped Gujarat.

''Michchhami Dukkadam'' (beg forgiveness for the wrong done) proclaimed a written statement with signatures of over 1,000 Jains of the city. The statement was made public at the recent Amrut Mahotsav celebrations organised by Gujarat Yuvak Kendra to mark Paryushan (period of abstinence for followers of Jainism). The week-long programme was inaugurated by city Mayor Himmatsinh Patel.

And no, none of the signatories were part of those horrendous mobs that tore through the social fabric of the city and the state at large. Instead, these ''good Samaritans'' are examples of Jainism - followers of Ahimsa.

Not only do they condemn the communal strife that gripped Gujarat, they have gone a step ahead and apologised for the barbarism unleashed by Gujaratis. ""Apologising for recent riots does not make us guilty of the wrong. We have just behaved like an elder member of any family would - seeking forgiveness for the wrong done for the society at large,"" explains Pramod B Shah, a member of the Kendra and general secretary of city Congress committee.

Parag Shah, a local businessman, reasons, ""Though we were not among the rioters, we are part of the society. We are also among the educated masses who neither took part in the rioting nor did anything to stop it. And, like true Jains, it becomes our duty to say ''Michchhami Dukkadam'' on behalf of all concerned.""

While this move has drawn ""strange"" questions even from their closest of friends, this group of Jains is steadfast in its belief that ""after all somebody has to take the lead in seeking forgiveness and vowing that such barbarism will never be allowed to recur.""

Founder-trustee of Preksha Vishwa Bharati (Koba), Subh Karan Surana, feels the best way to get over this crisis is to forgive and forget. Surana says: ""Gujarat being the land of Mahatma Gandhi, who preached non-violence throughout his life, we had to take the lead in an effort to break the ice.""

""The Jain Samaj is sad that such bloodshed and destruction was witnessed in Gujarat. That too at the behest of political leaders. Thus the apology,"" explains Jashvantlal C Shah, local industrialist and former managing director of Sarangpur Co-operative Bank.

24,Gowda to take train to Delhi with farmers,"BANGALORE : Former prime minister H.D.Deve Gowda will lead a huge rally of farmers from Karnataka to New Delhi in a special train to protest against the `anti-farmer'' policies of the Centre on October 2.

Speaking to reporters here on Friday, JD (S) State President Siddaramaiah said about 2000 farmers from various parts of the state will participate in the demonstration in front of PM''s residence. Gowda will travel in the second class bogie along with the farmers.

The special train, which is yet to be named, will leave Bangalore on September 29. ``The farmers will pay for the journey. The party may arrange food for them at Delhi on October 2,'''' he added.

Coffee, sugarcane and arecanut growers too will join the rally. Each bogie will depict the plight of the farmers in the form of painting or some art work.

Siddaramaiah said the farmers will personally apprise the PM their plight due to the insensitiveness and lop-sided priorities of both the Centre and state governments.

25,Veerappan victim's brother to get govt job,"BANGALORE: The youngest brother of slain police sub-inspector Shakeel Ahmed who was killed along with SP Harikrishna by Veerappan, is tobe given a job on compassionate grounds by the state government.

The job has been a long-standing demand of Ahmed''s family. Ahmed''s father, Abdul Kareem shot into the limelight after he opposed and won a case in the Supreme Court on the release of TADA detenus by the Karnataka government -- one of Veerappan''s demands to release cine star Rajkumar.

Ahmed''s brother M. Jameel, in an e-mail message to The Times of India, said: ``At long last, a decade after my brother''s martyrdom, the state government has decided to give the job of a first division clerk to my brother Farooq Ahmed. Though our family deserved a better deal, it is alright.''''

The state government, despite recommendations from the then DGPs T. Srinivasulu and C. Dinakar, was caught in a bind over providing a job to Farooq, because jobs on compassionate grounds are normally given only to the spouse or the children of the deceased. Since Ahmed was unmarried, his family insisted that the job should be given to Farooq.

Chief Minister S.M. Krishna, after a series of e-mail appeals from Jameel and Kareem, had directed the DGP to look into the matter and if possible, provide the job.

26,Mumbai activists welcome child development policy,"MUMBAI: Child rights activists have welcomed the state governmentâ€™s child development policy which was unveiled by chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh on Thursday.

But they say its implementation is the biggest challenge.

Maharashtra is the first state in the country to have such a policy. Nilima Mehta, chairperson of the child welfare committee, said the policy was a step in the right direction.

â€œIn principle, it is good as there should be a document, a reference point, that clearly states what the government must and should do for children,â€� she said.

While the policy does appear to encompass a number of issues concerning children, experts point out that the state needs to look into finer details of each issue that it plans to address.

The policy, for instance, mentions loan facilities to parents of child labourers to withdraw them from work.

Jeanne Davos, co-ordinator of the National Domestic Workers Movement, said the policy was fine, provided it reached the children concerned.

â€œIn Mumbai, there are around 40,000 children below 14 who are domestic workers.

Around three lakh under-18 children work in small-scale industries, Davos said, adding that once they are rescued, the concern would be to bring them to mainstream education.

The policy will also look into the prevention and reduction of child sexual exploitation and immoral trafficking.

Sangeeta Punekar of the Forum Against Child Sexual Exploitation, said the policy should lay special emphasis on the legal aspect of abuse and the proceedings of abuse cases should be made more childfriendly.

â€œThe trial procedures should begin immediately and the case should be handled sensitively,â€� she said. Then there are â€œrecurring abusersâ€�, who should not only be punished, but also be sent to â€œtherapeutic jailsâ€�.

The policy is based on the standards set by the Child Rights Convention.

According to child rights experts, the government should not merely aim at meeting international standards, but focus on reaching out to children.

Archana Shrivastav, a child rights co-ordinator, said, â€œIn Maharashtra, more than 30 per cent births are not registered. These are children of migrant workers or belong to families living on the streets.

An effort has to be made to reach out to them as these families donâ€™t register child births.â€� The government needs to allocate adequate funds for such efforts, and also to clear the backlog of pending birth certificates that have to be issued, she said.

27,MPCC report raps state govt,"MUMBAI: The Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee (MPCC) has submitted its report on the state governmentâ€™s performance to party high command.

The report, submitted by MPCC chief Govindrao Adik to All-India Congress Committee (AICC) general-secretary Vayalar Ravi, terms the Congress-led governmentâ€™s performance as â€œdismalâ€�, party sources said here.

The report is based on the feedback received from the partyâ€™s district units and severely criticises the â€œineptâ€� government, the sources said.

The MPCC had recently organised a two-day workshop of party workers and solicited their views on the governmentâ€™s performance.

The report paints a sorry picture of the government,which even after three years has â€œlittle to its credit to face the electorate in the next two yearsâ€�, sources said.

28,Decision on power tariff for farmers on Tuesday: CM,"CHANDIGARH: The Punjab government is yet to decide on whether to levy charges on power supply to the farm sector and if yes, at what rate.

Talking to reporters informally at Punjab Raj Bhawan here on Thursday after the oath ceremony of the new Punjab Public Service Commission chairman Lt Gen Surjit Singh, chief minister Amarinder Singh said the issue of power tariff for farm sector would be discussed and decided in the Cabinet meeting next Tuesday.

Clarifying that the state government was not challenging the new tariff for the farm and other sectors recommended by Punjab State Electricity Regulatory Commission (PSERC), Amarinder said it was within the domain of the state government to decide how much subsidy it can provide to any sector.

â€˜â€˜No one can stop us from paying more subsidy to our farmers who are passing through the most difficult times, especially due to drought-like conditions which have raised the cost of agricultural production substantially,â€™â€™ he added.

Taking a dig at the Akalis, Amarinder said it was the Akali government that singed an MoU for introducing power sector reforms and had set up PSERC and appointed its incumbent. â€˜â€˜Now, they are blaming us,â€™â€™ he said.

After considering the subsidy component offered by the Punjab government, PSERC had recommended a power tariff of Rs 60 per BPH per month for agricultural pump sets and at the rate of 57 paise per unit for metered supply. Since the government had not offered cent per cent subsidy to the farm sector, farmers were expected to pay the minimum tariff recommended by PSERC.

But now, the government intends to do a rethink, to weigh the likely fallout of abolition of free power to farm sector as not only are Akalis likely to cash the resentment among farmers but also there are voices of dissent within Congress.

Whether the state government endorses the tariff suggested for farm sector by PSERC or slashes it by enhancing the subsidy or even reverts to the old system of free supply â€” all options are open. However, indications are that the subsidy component would be raised.

29,HC issues notice to govt challenging MCOCA,"NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court on Friday issued notices to the Centre, Delhi government and state of Maharashtra on a petition challenging the provisions of MCOCA (Maharashtra Control of Organised Crimes Act).

A bench comprising justices S.B. Sinha and A.K. Sikri sought reply from the respondents on a public interest litigation contending that MCOCA, which was extended to Delhi, was against the fundamental rights of citizens.

The court fixed November 20 as the next date of hearing on the matter.

The petition filed by a non-governmental organisation, All-India Human Rights and Social Justice Front, termed the Act as â€œdraconianâ€� and alleged it was against the fundamental rights of the citizens as it curbs, abridges and deprives the personal liberty and provides for forfeiture of property without fair procedure of law.

Seeking to get MCOCA as ultra vires of the Constitution, the NGO submitted that the state legislature was not competent to legislate this Act and over-ride the fundamental rights and constitutional provisions.

30,Bengal CM exposes scam in his own govt,"KOLKATA: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee took the onus upon himself to unearth a major scam in one of the departments in his government â€” the agricultural marketing department â€” now under by senior Forward Bloc minister Chhaya Ghosh.

Bhattacharjee told a Left Front committee meeting on Friday that Ghoshâ€™s department had appointed 1700 people to collect tax â€˜â€˜worth croresâ€™â€™ from agricultural goods in complete violation of rules. He said there was no legal provision to collect such a tax and large amounts of money was being raised illegally and was not even being deposited in the government exchequer.

The allegations against a cabinet minister, who was brought in by the chief minister himself, shocked the Left Front leaders.

He snubbed Forward Bloc state secretary Ashok Ghosh who said that instead of raising the issue at a Left Front meeting, Bhattacharjee should have discussed the matter with his party in private. â€˜â€˜Why do you raise this issue here? The media will surely create an uproar over it,â€™â€™ Ghosh said. â€˜â€˜You could have told us privately,â€™â€™ he said. Bhattacharjee, however, reminded Ghosh that he had discussed the issue with both Ashok Ghosh as well as Chhaya Ghosh three times during the past year.

â€˜â€˜I first brought this to your notice before the last assembly elections. Though you said you would discuss the issue after the polls, you did not. Then I discussed it again with Chhayadi. I raised the issue again a few months ago when a truck carrying jute was stopped at Uluberia and was forced to pay the tax,â€™â€™ the chief minister said.

Bhattacharjee said he had even asked the agriculture marketing minister to transfer the 1700 employees to other departments and stop the illegal collection. As the Forward Bloc leaders remained voiceless, fisheries minister Kironmoy Nanda took the cue saying even his department had become victim to similar extortion on several occasions.

The agricultural marketing minister was not available for comment as she was unwell.

32,Analysis: Why elections draw blood in J&K,"NEW DELHI: Union government officials say that the sudden upsurge in violence in Jammu and Kashmir ahead of polls is a measure of the success in initiating a dialogue with the All Parties Hurriyat Conference.

According to a senior home ministry official, Pakistani controllers, under pressure from the United States, were initially hesitant in using violence to disrupt the polls. They expected the Hurriyat to strongly denounce elections and conduct a state-wide campaign against the polls. â€˜â€˜Instead the Hurriyat entered into a dialogue with the Kashmir Committee and has not made any categorical pronouncements against the elections, leave alone campaign against them.â€™â€™

This, says the official, compelled the Pakistani controllers to unleash a terrorist campaign against the electoral process, manifested in the assassination of J&K law minister Mushtaq Ahmad Lone. â€˜â€˜There is bound to be a negative impact of the killing,â€™â€™ says the official, â€˜â€˜but it has come a week late. Had it happened before the filing of nominations, its impact could have been disastrous.â€™â€™

Violence in the state now appears to be carefully calibrated to show that the action is being undertaken by local Kashmiri organisations.

â€˜â€˜The aim is to show that Pakistan has stopped physical support to militancy,â€™â€™ says the official, â€˜â€˜but the high profile incidents like the assassination of Abdul Ghani Lone or Mushtaq Lone were almost always undertaken by Pakistani terrorists,â€™â€™ he claimed.

The Pakistani controllers expected the anti-election campaign to be led by the Hurriyat, but under pressure from its constituents and its western friends, the Hurriyat wilted, so the violence has been stepped up. The main targets are the National Conference party ministers and activists, followed by Mufti Mohammed Sayeedâ€™s Peopleâ€™s Democratic Party (PDP), the Congress and the CPI(M).

In the past ten days or so, for example, terrorists have shot dead Mohammed Ibrahim Dar, a CPI(M) activist, Abdul Rehman Sheikh, an independent candidate, Mohd Ahsan Dar, an NC activist of Wagt village in Kupwara district, PDP activist Ghulam Nabi Hakim, and a woman activist of the NC, Mehra.

In addition, several rallies and motorcades came under fire from terrorists across the state.

There is also a systematic campaign of intimidation. These have been in the form of press releases, posters and even e-mails, demanding a boycott of elections.

Given this pattern, the government is bracing for more violence in Jammu and Kashmir.

Officials say that they expect attacks on political activists and security forces to be stepped up not only in the run-up to the elections, but even after the results are declared.
