0,GGH waits for government nod,"vijayawada: the government general hospital is waiting for aid from the netherlands government for procuring modern equipment to provide better healthcare to the hundreds of patients visiting the hospital besides imparting better training for medical students. the hospital needs calorimeter instruments in the bio-chemistry section and kits for thyroid profile, hormonal assays, lipid profile tests.two ventilators and two ecg machines and an ultra sound are required in the cardiology wing. an infant ventilator, blood gas analyser, incubator servo and nebuliser are essential in the paediatrics ward for extending improved health care facilities to children and new-borns. a pulse ox meter has to be installed in the department of obstetrics and gynaecology ward to improve patient\foetal care and also impart improved training to students. lack of modern equipment has become a handicap in equipping the students with advanced health care techniques. so installing these equipment is very essential in this teaching hospital, authorities pointed out. over 200 cases come to the ggh for a ct scan every month. a new ct scanner is required to improve overall patient care and reduce mortality. the modern digital ultra sonograph interfaced with computer and cd writer is intended to be installed in the ggh to expose students to new diagnostic tools, the hospital authorities said. necessary proposals indicating the requirement of modern diagnostic tools have been forwarded to the state government long ago to secure funds from the netherlands. but so far there has been no response from the government. some nris have come forward to install modern equipment in the cardiology wing of the hospital, but are apprehensive about whether the equipment would be put to better use. maintenance of these equipment also poses a serious problem to the cash-starved ggh.

1,Social unrest baffles Surat,"surat: apparently things appear calm here but undercurrents are threatening to turn into a law and order problem in the backdrop of the communal flare-up. with a floating population, comprising lumpen elements, for the law enforcing agencies the city is like a tinder box, just needing a combination of evil designs to explode and brand the city as communally sensitive. so far, the public had not given any space to the communal divide. but what the address of pravin togadia, general secretary of vishwa hindu parishad (vhp) sparked on december 9 and the muslim response, is nothing but creating communal disorder. politics and religion luckily have not been able to dismantle the peaceful social fabric here so far, additional police commissioner mohan jha said. but, one must look deeper. the retaliation in the form of a rally by a group of 50-60 muslims on saturday despite prohibitory orders. some months back, the bajrang dal had held a meeting in which 'trishuls' were distributed. fortunately, the major political parties have stayed away from this. in fact, one babubhai pathan, a lawyer, who masterminded the rally despite ban failed to get support from the muslim leaders. in fact, the 1992 communal riots in ayodhya aftermath, haunt the people and none from any community would endorse ghastly steps, sources in intelligence wings at local level said. but, the question for the security agencies and the district administration remains as how to effectively curtail ill-designed moves by a section across the communities? though effective policing is essential but to maintain social harmony requires a conducive environment in which communally sensitive issues should not be blown or given any space, according to senior police officers. on the other hand, with vacuum in leadership in major political parties, for many it appears to be convenient to divide the masses on communal lines and then to grab the leadership for vested interests, sources in political parties remarked.

2,Student morcha to protest axing of grants,"pune: the state government's decision to effect massive cuts in the grants given to educational institutions in the state in the next academic year has come under attack from the students' federation of india (sfi). the federation will take out a morcha to the pune university campus on december 20 to protest against the government decision. only last week, the state government had filed an affidavit in the bombay high court stating its intention to cut grants for educational institutes from the next academic year. the government has hinted that this will result in a significant fee hike and, except for students from below poverty line (bpl) families, others will have to cough up more towards fees. the government as part of its ""austerity measures"" has also decided against starting new primary or secondary schools, technical or agriculture institutes and giving fresh grants to private organisations to set up educational institutes. a statement released by sfi said that the government's affidavit clearly states that grants given to educational institutions for paying salary to staff or for meeting other expenses will be reduced in a piecemeal manner, and will be subsequently stopped completely. the sfi charged that the government has also decided to charge fees from students belonging to the backward classes and from the economically poor sections. as the sfi has pointed out, this cutback has come at a time when the union government has tabled the 93rd amendment bill that offers free education to students in the 6-14 age group.

3,State says elections can still be rescheduled,"pune: although acknowleding that it is mandatory to hold civic polls by march next year, the state government in an affidavit filed in the bombay high court on wednesday, has said that it was still possible for the state election commission to draw a fresh election schedule for the pune municipal corporation (pmc) polls scheduled for february 10. the state claimed that the election commission could re-plan the civic polls even now, as the code of conduct was yet to come into force. the state took this stand in the high court which is disposing of a petition filed by bjp corporators from pune who are challenging the delinking of 20 fringe villages from the pune municipal corporation (pmc) limits. the controversy erupted after residents of the delinked villages complained that they would not get proper representation for five years if the elections are held with the present schedule. ironically, although the delinked villages will have a representative, the development works would be controlled by the zilla parishad. the petitioners - bjp corporators ujwal keskar, vikas mathkari, suhas kulkarni and ashok yenpure - have appealed to the court that the state's decision to delink 20 villages should be quashed as it was done in haste, without giving enough time for objections and suggestions. the state refuted all the charges on wednesday by contending that the delinking decision was announced after having due consultations with the residents of the concerned villages. representing the state government, advocate-general ghoolam vahanvati said the state had conducted a proper survey through a one-man commission before making the decision to delink 20 out of the 38 fringe villages inside the pmc limits. reacting to the charges of the election commission, that the state announced the delinking decision despite letters it has sent to the contrary, mr vahanvati said the government went ahead with the declaration as the election code of conduct was yet to come into force. the election commission had charged the state government with ignoring its letters before and after november 1, the date on which the delinking decision was formally announced by the government. similarly, the state government counsel said it had gone ahead with the publication of the gazette notification on delinking on november 17 as there was no code of conduct in force then. in fact, the code of conduct would come into effect only from january 4 when the candidates of various parties file their nominations. mr vahanwati said the state had also held holistic discussions with the pmc before announcing the delinking decision as per the requirements of the law. the pmc has been asked by the court to file its say by friday when a final decision in this matter is expected. interestingly, minister of state for pwd balasaheb shivarkar was present throughout the hearing of the case. it is the first time that any minister has attended the complete hearing in this controversial matter, said sources. the case was heard by a division bench comprising justices g. d. patil and pratibha upasani.

5,"TADA not applicable to Dutt, say lawyers","mumbai: actor sanjay dutt, an accused in the serial bomb blasts of 1993, on wednesday, submitted before a designated tada court that provisions of tada could not be invoked against him. for the second consecutive day, dutt's lawyers rajender singh and satish maneshinde argued that the actor was never in possession of any prohibited weapon and that the prosecution too did not have evidence to show that he was ever in possession of such firearms. judge kode observed that there is no evidence on either side, prosecution or defence, to show whether the alleged firearm was used or not. mr singh relied on a 1994 supreme court judgment, which said under tada both possession of prohibited firearm in a notified area and its use has to be established. the defence team said based on the apex court ruling, cbi's case against dutt would fail. furthermore, they said that assuming, for argument's sake, that the actor did possess an ak-56 rifle, he could be tried only under the arms act. the defence also said `mens rea' (guilty mind), which is necessary to make any offence punishable under any penal code, was clearly absent in dutt's case. ``there was no intention to use firearms for any terrorist offence. the prosecution also does not have any evidence of use of weapon by the actor for any terrorist activity,'' dutt's lawyers said. the other point submitted by the defence was even confessions of co-accused did not disclose any commission of offence under tada by the actor. dutt's lawyers said confessions of the other accused spoke only of destruction of evidence which is punishable only under the indian penal code. special public prosecutor ujjwal nikam had earlier contended that dutt had confessed that he had instructed his friends to get rid and destroy the ak-56. he said under tada it was not necessary for prosecution to establish use of weapon. dutt's defence submissions would continue on thursday. his lawyers were also allowed, after a no objection from mr nikam, to sum up arguments after the submissions of two other co-accused which are yet to be made.

6,NBA refutes media reports on 'unlawful activities',"mumbai: the narmada bachao andolan (nba) has refuted media reports that the ahmedabad high court had suggested the centre should look into the organisation's 'unlawful activities.' andolan representative medha patkar told the press here on wednesday that these ``false'' reports were part of a vilification campaign. earlier this week, several newspapers had carried reports on an order issued by the ahmedabad high court in a petition filed by v.k. saxena and the national council of civil liberties asking for a ban on the nba under the unlawful activities act, 1957. the reports had stated that the court had suggested that union government should look into the allegations of unlawful activities, including tax violations and passing of national secrets to foreign powers. challenging the press articles as ``misreporting'', ms patkar pointed out that the court had in fact dismissed the petition, mentioning that ``it is upto the central government to look into allegations by both parties and decide whether to ban the nba or not''. ms patkar labelled the allegations against nba as ``fake'', and part of a ``vicious defamatory campaign'' against the narmada bachao movement undertaken by ``desperate'' people. ``the unlawful activities act refers to activities which `threaten the sovereignty of the nation' but it is the government policies of privatisation which is threatening the nation,'' she said, adding that the people had the right to form unions and associations, and protest against government decisions, under the constitution. speaking on the status of rehabilitation of the project affected people in maharashtra and madhya pradesh, ms patkar said that while no progress had been made on adequate rehab of people, at least the panel set up by the maharashtra government to verify the availability of land for the displaced was functioning well. it may be recalled that several hundred displaced villagers and activists had gone on a hunger fast earlier this year to press for the implementation of the justice daud committee's recommendations on rehabilitation and a resurvey of the affected villages. the government had then set up a committee to assess some controversial aspects of resettlement. it had also said that it would ask the narmada control authority not to raise the height of the dam beyond 90 metres if new paps are identified and not resettled as per the supreme court judgment on the issue. according to ms patkar, the committee, which has nba representatives on board, has verified nine villages so far. ``i am happy about the process, all demands and claims are being documented. but the committee has discovered that there are more villages than earlier recorded that need to be surveyed,'' ms patkar said. ``the task force will take its resurvey and reccomendations to the government. after that, implementation, as always, will be the major problem.'' in addition, in mp the narmada valley development authority had increased the land area affected by the dam by 12.5 per cent based on physical reverification. ms patkar also affirned the nba's support to the anti-dam activists and villagers in tehri garwal noting that the submergence of the township was imminent.

7,BMC changes boundaries of wards for polls,"mumbai: the brihanmumbai municipal corporation's (bmc) election office has changed the boundaries of as many as 85 of the 227 electoral wards as part of the delimitation process initiated by the administration. municipal elections are to be held on february 10, 2002. after receiving about 400 objections and suggestions from the public, the administration was compelled to carry out minor changes in five of these wards, mainly h-east (bandra), e (byculla), m-east (chembur), s (bhandup) and t (mulund) wards. delimitation of wards has been carried out smoothly without much resistance from sitting corporators. many of them are already unhappy at the way wards have been reserved for women, other backward castes (obcs), scheduled castes and tribes (scs-sts) candidates by way of a controversial lottery system, which has been challenged in the court. ward limits are generally rearranged before civic elections in order to ensure that the population in all wards are more or less equal. no ward should have more or less people than other wards. for instance, the delimitation exercise carried out recently by the election office has been done in such a way that every electoral ward has an average population of about 43,000 people. however, ward no 122, which comprises the nirlon area in goregaon, has the highest population of 51,790. ward no 110 (versova) has the smallest population of 36,387. ``we have also seen to it that no ward has less than 25,000 voters or more than 50,000 voters,'' said additional municipal commissioner gautam chatterji, who is in charge of the civic election process. only 99 of the 227 wards are in the general category, while the rest are reserved for women, obc, sc and st candidates. according to the election office, the maximum concentration of scheduled caste people is found in ward no 69 of mukund nagar, dharavi (16,677). other areas having large concentration of scs include bainganwadi in chembur, shantinagar, parel, and prabhakar kunte nagar, dharavi. interestingly, the bmc had to rely on population figures of the 1991 census, which pegs the city's population at close to ten million people. mumbai's population has since burgeoned to 1.19 crores. the administration claims it did not have the figures of the 2001 census. the 2001 census figures show that andheri, malad and bhandup have registered the highest growth rate since 1991. andheri itself has 15 lakh people, which is more than the population of the state of goa. chembur (east) and borivli are close behind these top three. parel, dadar and matunga have registered a sharp decline in population. the least populated areas are the business districts of a, b and c wards. in fact, the population of b ward, according to the latest census, is barely 1.40 lakhs. however, according to the bmc, six administrative wards have seen a rise in population varying from 28 per cent to 72 per cent. these are h-east (bandra), p-north (malad), r-central (borivli), l (kurla), m-east (chembur) and s (bhandup). ``six new electoral wards have been created within these areas because of the rise in population,'' said municipal election officer narayan mundale. the bmc has also ensured that no electoral ward will overlap into another administrative ward. earlier, some corporators had to run to two different ward offices as part of their area fell in one administrative ward (for instance, c ward), while another fell in an adjoining ward (d ward). the bmc has allocated a budget of rs 20 crores for the civic elections. the expenditure will be mainly for printing ballot papers, electoral rolls and setting up polling booths all over the city.

8,Andhra tobacco farmers urge cut in excise duty,"new delhi: expecting 105 mt of tobacco crop, more than the tobacco board's fixed requirement, the federation of andhra pradesh tobacco farmers on wednesday demanded reduction in excise duty on the tobacco variety grown in andhra pradesh and an increase in the minimum support price. ""we demand a practical, reasonable and a non-discriminatory legislation policy to counter the drop in domestic demand largely due to high and discriminatory rate of taxation,"" g siva ram prasad, secretary, tobacco growers welfare association (guntur), told reporters here. ""the government gets an excise duty of rs 680 per kg of flue-cured virginia (fcv) tobacco, mainly grown in ap, as against just rs 40 per kg on the tobacco meant for bidi,"" prasad said, adding this vast difference in excise duty had severely hit sale of tobacco as well as cigarettes. moreover, the msp for different types of tobacco ranges from rs five to rs 26 which does not renumerate even our production cost, he said and added ""the msp, to which farmers turn only as a distress measure, should be revised upwards at least upto rs 15-rs 40."" ""of the 150 mt fcv crop, 70 per cent is grown in ap and 70 mt is exported, but after disintegration of ussr, the main importer of our tobacco, our exports have suffered,"" m venkata rao, president tgwa, said. ""china has emerged as our main rival as in many other sectors as they sell at a cheaper rate than india"", rao said. due to a fall in crop prices as well as production we declared year 2000-2001 as crop holiday year and tried out alternative crops like paddy, chillies and cotton which failed dismally, srihari rao, president, virginia tobacco growers association (thorrendu) said.

9,"Cong, Opposition back govt","new delhi: congress president sonia gandhi and the rest of the opposition solidly backed the government on wednesday, regarding whatever steps it took to tackle terrorism in the wake of the december 13 attacks on parliament. ''the congress would back the government in its efforts to track down and bring to justice terrorists who are threatening the nation's integrity today,'' sonia said, participating in the special discussion in the lok sabha on the terrorist attack on parliament. the need of the hour for the government and all political parties, she said, was to rise above partisan considerations. in an apparent reference to the government's move to introduce the anti-terrorism bill replacing the prevention of terrorism ordinance (poto), sonia said: ''this is also the time for all concerned to desist from raising contentious issues that divide our plural society.'' sonia made a strong plea for india to embark upon a concerted diplomatic offensive and garner the full support of the international community''. ncp leader sharad pawar said there was need for all political parties to come out in full support of whatever decision the government takes in national interest to tackle the situation.

10,No party is innocent: CEC,"lucknow: no political party in up is without a nexus with the criminals and their shadow looms large on the forthcoming assembly polls, says former chief election commissioner, gvg krishnamurthy. it is not a mere observation, but my experience of conducting elections thrice to the parliament in 1996, 1998 and 1999 and once to the up assembly, he asserted. although a member of the bjp now, he still refuses to give a clean chit to the party on this count. he said a record number of 13.52 lakh anti-social elements were rounded off at the behest of his order to ensure free and fair lok sabha elections in up in 1999. its impact was that the elections were held peacefully in the state, he added. talking to the times news network, he said criminalisation of politics and corruption are the two major factors afflicting the whole election system, adding electoral reforms were a must, if democracy was to function and survive. but, he said electoral reforms recommended by three successive committees headed by jaiprakash, tarakunde and goswami could never be implemented due to their rejection by the parliament. what was even more worst, krishnamurthy said, that political parties advocating for electoral reforms outside the parliament, had never pressed for the issue inside the house. the parliament and assemblies are like a cockpit of our democratic vehicle. if criminals come to steer it and electoral reforms are not taken to keep them away, then the future of the country will remain as gloomy as one can think of, he remarked. electoral reforms, he said could be brought about by four ways — by amending the constitution of india, the people's representation act 1950 and 1951 and the conduct of election rules 1961. the fourth one could be initiated by the election commission. some of measures, introduced by him during his tenure were elimination of non-serious political parties and candidates, mandatory organisational election of political parties to ensure internal democracies, mixing of votes while counting them. notably, the affidavits made mandatory for the candidates to give details about their criminal history, jail-status and pending cases in various courts, had proved to be a deterrent to those of criminal-antecedents. he, however, admitted that such measures should be enforced stringently in order to discourage criminals from the politics. but then he said that it was not the bill, but the political will, which would actually serve the purpose of electoral reforms.

12,Rajnath ready for mid-Feb dates for polls,"lucknow: when chief minister rajnath singh met officials of the election commission in delhi last week, he conveyed his government's willingness to hold elections in the state in mid-february, 2002. though the term of the assembly is till march 26, 2002, the rajnath government wants the elections to be held in the state sometimes in mid-february - ostensibly for two reasons. one, astrologers of the chief minister have predicted a good time (read rajyog) for him after february 19, and secondly, it would not be feasible administratively to conduct polls in march, as the state board examinations for inter and matriculation classes start by that time. the chief minister confirmed that he wanted elections in mid-february. i have not given anything in writing, but i had meetings with the election commission officials in which i had conveyed that elections in the state should be held in mid-february, he said. he told times news network on wednesday that though the state government cannot decide about the dates of elections, but as chief minister i have conveyed our convenient dates to the chief election commissioner. the final decision, however, has to be taken by the ec, he added. in one of the cabinet meetings, held around a month back, senior ministers from bjp and its allies did discuss about the probable dates for the assembly elections. then also it was thought unanimously that elections should be held sometimes in mid-february. the chief minister had then assured the cabinet that he would write a request letter to the cec about this. there is no need to send any communication to ec, said rajnath. the ec had recently sent its officials to up. they had long discussions with senior officials of the state and have probably made up their mind about the probable dates for elections, said the cm.

13,Cong to monitor government's actions,"new delhi: congress president sonia gandhi on thursday said her party would keep a strict vigil over the administrative, political and diplomatic steps which the nda government initiates in tackling the extraordinary situation arising following the terrorist attack on parliament. ""we must keep vigil over the administrative, political and diplomatic steps which the government takes to meet the needs of the extraordinary situation. precious little substance was revealed by government in parliament about what specifically it intends to do"", gandhi said while addressing a general body meeting of the congress parliamentary party. gandhi, who is also the leader of opposition and chairperson of the cpp said though the whole nation would rise as one to combat terrorism which has been ailing the country for more than two decades, congress would be very carefully monitoring developments in this regard. gandhi also assailed the government for its failure to act against terrorism inspite of advance intelligence furnished to it, including that from maharashtra government. ""it was the failure of the intelligence which led to tragedy of kargil. it is again the failure to act upon available intelligence which lies at the root of the attack on parliament"", she said. referring to the ""unfortunate"" climax to the session which has been declared sine die two days before its schedule, gandhi said though the democracy survived following the attack, it was due to the bravery and unflinching sense of duty of those nine men and women who sacrificed their lives. strongly opposing the re-induction of defence minister george fernandes and harin pathak into the cabinet, gandhi said it was ""inexplicable"" that prime minister atal bihari vajpayee was so weak to admit back to his council of ministers, ""persons who have been so discredited that he himself had asked them to leave"". ""they have not been cleared. indeed, the judicial process, in some cases, and commissions of enquiry, in other cases, are far from completing their work,"" she said adding if the prime minister has succumbed to internal political pressure to accomodate these flawed persons then it gives the country no confidence in the ability of his government to resist unhealthy influences in other areas of concern. referring to the cag report which rocked the parliament following its findings on murky defence deals including coffins for the kargil martyrs, gandhi said it was shocking that this government played with the honour and sentiments of this country in the kargil war. ""the cag report is conclusive and damning...instead of making a clean breast of its mistakes, the government has sought to hide its weaknesses behind a smokescreen of technicalities"", she said. gandhi said congress was ready for a through debate on the issue but it was the adamant government, knowing its mistakes would be revealed, that it procrastinates. gandhi said congress was also ready to discuss the controversial ordinance poto but none of the arguments that the party had advanced outside the house in this regard were convincingly refuted. the party also stands by its offer of a de novo examination of the legal instruments required to sustain its struggle against terrorism, she said and added that poto, which was in operation for nearly two months, could not stop the terrorists on attacking parliament. on the failure of the government at wto doha round of talks, gandhi said the tall claims made by the nda government have been exposed and it was the duty of the party mps to explain these complicated matters to the people at large. annoyed with the ""persisting"" problems of poor attendence of party members in both the houses of parliament, gandhi asked suggestions from party mps how to solve it, particularly at a time when key issues were discussion. stating that the inter-session period would be a busy schedule for the party in the wake of assembly elections in uttar pradesh, punjab, uttaranchal and manipur, gandhi sought maximum cooperation of party leaders and members to ensure victory for congress in these states.

16,Rajnath-Kalraj strife led to my arrest: Tripathi,"lucknow: my arrest is the result of caste differences within the bharatiya janata party (bjp) and between chief minister rajnath singh and state party president kalraj misra, said sacked minister amarmani tripathi, talking to mediamen soon after his arrest by the special task force (stf), at the hazratganj police station late on wednesday night. amarmani was arrested on charges of harbouring kidnappers and involvement in in criminal conspiracy near carlton hotel as he left the house of another cabinet minister on wednesday night in his white cielo. his driver, stf sources said, tried to speed back to the house of the minister when tripathi sensed 'trouble' as the stf vehicles tried to intercept him. however, the sleuths managed to zero in on him. interestingly, soon after his arrest, his police gunner disappeared from the scene and was untraceable till late in the night. the speaker of vidhan sabha was informed soon by the senior stf officials as he is still a member of the legislative assembly. his family members were also officially informed about his arrest. amarmani claimed that he had been falsely implicated and that the chief minister had gone on record about clinching evidence against him. now let us see what that evidence is like, amarmani said. whatever has happened has let the lid off on the internal differences the bjp is facing in the state, tripathi said adding that he had exceptionally good relations with kalraj mishra for which he had to see this day. i had refused to contest the elections on the bjp symbol when the chief minister asked me... as the equations in my constituency do not permit so, amarmani said, adding that he had put all his might to see that the bjp-led government remained in the driving seat in the state. i have fought to save kalyan singh government and brought back the loktantrik congress party (lcp) ministers back even after they had taken oath then, he said quoting his moves to save the bjp coalition in up. again, when naresh agarwal was sacked, i was given the state plane to hold up all the ministers in hardwar in order to ensure that there was no split and i did the job as desired by the leadership, tripathi lamented, in between talking to his brother-in-law ashwani on phone, informing him about his arrest.

20,Cong criticises govt for Parliament attack,"new delhi: a day after backing government in the fight against terrorism, congress president sonia gandhi on thursday attacked the government for its ""failure"" to avert terrorist attack on parliament despite advance intelligence from maharashtra government. ""it is distressing that the government showed itself so ill-prepared for the attack notwithstanding advance intelligence furnished among others by our state government in maharashtra"", gandhi said addressing general body meeting of the congress parliamentary party. she said that it was the ""failure of the intelligence which led to tragedy of kargil. it is again the failure to act upon available intelligence which lies at the root of the attack on parliament"". noting that the unfortunate climax to the session was the terrorist attack, gandhi, who is also the leader of the opposition, said ""india's democracy has survived, but it has been a very near thing"". stating that precious little of substance was revealed by government in parliament about what specifically it intended to do in the wake of the attack, gandhi said that her party would be carefully monitoring developments in this regard. at the same time, she asserted that ""the nation will rise as one man to combat terrorism which has been ailing our country for nearly two decades"". the address also saw gandhi launching a scathing attack on reinduction of george fernandes as defence minister and minister of state for defence harin pathak. without naming either of the ministers, gandhi said it was ""inexplicable"" that the prime minister should be ""so weak"" as to readmit into his council of ministers persons who had been ""so discredited that he had himself asked them to leave"". ""if the prime minister has succumbed to internal political pressure to accommodate these flawed persons then it gives the country no confidence in the ability of his government to resist unhealthy influences in other areas of concern"", she said. stating that the cag report on arms procurement during the kargil conflict was ""conclusive and damning"", gandhi said ""even in buying coffins for our martyrs, this government has not not been above board. reiterating the congress objection to poto, she said that the party stood by its offer of a de novo examination of the legal instruments required to sustain our struggle against terrorism.

21,BJP legislature party in Chhattisgarh splits,"raipur: in a major political development that is likely to have an impact on national politics, the 35-member bjp legislature party split on thursday with 12 bjp mlas quitting the party and announcing the formation of a regional party, the chhattisgarh vikas party, headed by raipur mayor tarun chatterjee. the split was dramatic, but not surprising, as the dissident mlas were preparing to leave the party for the last couple of months and were in fact held ""hostage"" in some farmhouses near here. read this story in... the split, being termed as a major stroke by chief minister ajit jogi, is likely to have an impact in the coming elections in up and the rajya sabha elections from chhattisgarh next year. both the rs seats from this state can now be bagged by the congress. the congress already had 50 members in the 90-member house and the split was not necessary for the survival of its government. the bjp, which had 36 members in the house, has now been reduced to 23 as one member had resigned last year soon after the formation of the state and 12 members deserted it on thursday. jogi told times news network: ""we caused the split just on the eve of the up elections. the split will have more impact on national politics than in the state."" he claimed that the dissident bjp mlas, who have been allotted separate seats in the assembly by the speaker, would ultimately join the congress as they have expressed their loyalty to congress president sonia gandhi. he denied the bjp charge that money had changed hands or that official machinery had been misused in causing the split. this is the second split in the bjp in the last one year. jogi had caused the resignation of bjp legislator ramdayal uike from marwahi and got elected from there. with the latest major political surgery in the main opposition party in chhatisgarh, jogi, who was locked in a controversy over his caste credentials, has emerged stronger.

25,Congress rally proves to be a flop show,"jalandhar:the first congress test of strength proved a flop show in jalandhar north constituency with the party's rally at pholriwal, on the outskirts of jalandhar, managing to muster only between 800 to 1,200 people, on wednesday. not only the numbers but even the unresponsive and listless mood of the audience showed all was not well within the faction-ridden congress. added to this was the absence from the rally of senior congress leaders of the region like member of parliament balbir singh, congress (rural) president amarjit singh samra and state congress president amarinder singh. however, the rally was a shot in the arm for pawan tinnu of the bahujan samaj party. ""we are going to change the role of our party from that of damaging others' prospects to being victor and ruler,"" he said. that did not seem much of a fantasy if one went by the number and mood of the audience at pholriwal. tempers ran high when a photographer was caught by the organisers, who confessed that he was 'spying' for the bsp. tinnu, when asked, said it was true. ""it is no crime to take photographs in a public function or to hire one.we wanted a record of the true volume of the crowd so that a section of the media does not mislead the people by projecting wrong figures. in future, we will do it openly."" the sitting mla from this constituency is bhagat chunni lal of the bjp, who is unwell, according to party sources. the leading aspirant from the congress is mohinder kaypee.

27,Social unrest baffles Surat,"surat: apparently things appear calm here but undercurrents are threatening to turn into a law and order problem in the backdrop of the communal flare-up. with a floating population, comprising lumpen elements, for the law enforcing agencies the city is like a tinder box, just needing a combination of evil designs to explode and brand the city as communally sensitive. so far, the public had not given any space to the communal divide. but what the address of pravin togadia, general secretary of vishwa hindu parishad (vhp) sparked on december 9 and the muslim response, is nothing but creating communal disorder. politics and religion luckily have not been able to dismantle the peaceful social fabric here so far, additional police commissioner mohan jha said. but, one must look deeper. the retaliation in the form of a rally by a group of 50-60 muslims on saturday despite prohibitory orders. some months back, the bajrang dal had held a meeting in which 'trishuls' were distributed. fortunately, the major political parties have stayed away from this. in fact, one babubhai pathan, a lawyer, who masterminded the rally despite ban failed to get support from the muslim leaders. in fact, the 1992 communal riots in ayodhya aftermath, haunt the people and none from any community would endorse ghastly steps, sources in intelligence wings at local level said. but, the question for the security agencies and the district administration remains as how to effectively curtail ill-designed moves by a section across the communities? though effective policing is essential but to maintain social harmony requires a conducive environment in which communally sensitive issues should not be blown or given any space, according to senior police officers. on the other hand, with vacuum in leadership in major political parties, for many it appears to be convenient to divide the masses on communal lines and then to grab the leadership for vested interests, sources in political parties remarked.

31,"BCI recognises law colleges, but not varsity","bangalore: how is it for colleges being recognised and not the university that they belong to? this is exactly the case with kuvempu university and five law colleges coming under it. five law colleges -- saraswati law college, chitradurga; r.l. law college, davanagere; s.j.m. law college, chitradurga; national law college, shimoga; and gangotri law college, sagar -- which came under mysore university before the establishment of kuvempu university in 1994/95, are recognised by the bar council of india (bci). but so far, the bci has not showed any signs of inspecting and evaluating kuvempu university, to which the five law colleges now belong. the bci has been entrusted with the total responsibility, power and duty to promote legal education and to recognise the universities whose degrees in law shall be the qualification for enrolment as an advocate. this is in accordance with section 7 of the advocates act, wherein the bci has to lay down standards of legal education in consultation with the universities in india and the respective state bar councils. ``now with the bci having failed to discharge its duty, kuvempu university has shot off several applications to the bci seeking approval, but let alone the bci committee submitting a report, it has not even visited the university,'' officials lamented. the ``callous'' attitude of the bci is forcing scores of students to live under the constant fear of not getting enrolment as practising advocates in the state bar council if the bci suddenly deems the university unfit for recognition. the state bar council, however, doesn't seem to have had a say in the uncertainty of the matter. ``by virtue of the law colleges in this university being recognised, we will continue to admit law graduates from these colleges and enrol them to the bar. but if the bci decides to de-recognise the university, then the future graduates will not be entertained,'' chairman of the state bar council v.t. raya raddi said.
