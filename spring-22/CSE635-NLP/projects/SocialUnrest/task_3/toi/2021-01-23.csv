0,"LS polls: MP, MLA lock horns over Cong ticket","KANPUR: The possibility of early Lok Sabha elections has brought the internal bickering in the city unit of the Congress to the fore. The present MP and Govind Nagar MLA have locked their horns over the party ticket.

In fact, the relationship between MP Shree Prakash Jaiswal and MLA Ajay Kapoor had turned soar over the past several months. Both have kept away from functions organised by each other.

Recently, Kapoor stayed away from the Chetavani rally organised by the MP. However, the discord came out in open after Kapoor evinced interest in contesting Lok Sabha elections from the city much to the chagrin of Jaiswal. It has to be noted that heavy voting in Govind Nagar had ensured Jaiswal''s victory in the last general elections.

Kapoor had been camping in Delhi for the past week to convince senior party leaders. ""I met senior party leaders. However, nothing is finalised as yet,"" he told TNN. He cited slow pace of development in the city as the main reason for his candidature.

On the other hand, Jaiswal has no doubts. ""The annual MP fund of Rs 2 crore has been distributed in 100 wards of the city with special attention on lesser developed wards,"" he said. Barring bringing the city on air traffic map, the MP claims to have fulfilled all other promises made during elections. The bickering between the two city bigwigs of the party have put senior leaders in a spot. City president Abdul Mannan, a close ally of Kapoor, told TNN, ""with merely eight LS seats in the state, the party cannot afford to take chances.""

However, party sources claim that Kapoor''s efforts were merely an attempt to unsettle Jaiswal. ""The Bharatiya Janata Party is likely to give LS ticket from the city to Cantt MLA Satish Mahana who is a close relative of Kapoor.

Hence, he is trying to create problems for Jaiswal,"" they said.

1,Governor concerned over snapping of farmers' lines,"GANDHINAGAR: Governor Kailashpati Mishra has expressed serious concern over snapping of nearly 1,000 farmers'' power connections, mainly in Kutch district, where for the last two days over 10,000 Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS) supporters have been staging demonstrations against the ""oppressive tactic"" of the Narendra Modi government. During a meeting with 11 BKS office-bearers led by state chief Prafull Sejalia and secretary Magan Patel on Friday, Mishra said, ""if this was true, then this should not happen"".

On late Thursday, Mishra met minister of state for energy Saurabh Patel and agriculture minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasma in a bid to cool tempers between the BKS and the state government.

Mishra, an elderly RSS pracharak, told the BKS leaders on Friday and the two ministers on Thursday that there was no alternative to holding talks. ""Problems arise in a family when there is lack of proper coordination,"" he was quoted as saying by a BKS spokesperson. The BKS is the farmers'' wing of the Sangh Parivar.

Targeting Modi, BKS leaders said that the chief minister was terrorising the farmers agitating against the power tariff hike, hence President''s rule should be imposed. They alleged that there was no rule of law, particularly in rural areas. To this, Mishra replied that he wanted proof of what was happening so that he could look into the matter.The BKS leaders, citing instances of how IPC clauses related to loot and theft were being enforced on farmers in Jamnagar, said that they would return with more facts.

Talking to reporters, a BKS spokesperson said that Mishra was the only person in the state government who was willing to listen to farmers. ""He talked to us as an elder in the family,"" he said.

2,Veteran Sangh leader rattles Modi govt,"AHMEDABAD: He is causing a lot of embarrassment to the Modi government with each passing day. And if BKS, SJM and BJP are members of the same Sangh Parivar, then the family is washing a lot of dirty linen in public these days.

The former ''sahprant pracharak'' of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) Laljibhai Patel has suddenly shot into limelight as he has undertaken an indefinite fast in support of the farmers'' agitation launched by Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS) over the power tariff issue. The veteran Sangh leader has rattled the Modi government which is still trying to find ways of wriggling out of the situation. However, when the Modi government evicted the BKS from its official accommodation in Gandhinagar last month, a lot of RSS activists, including Laljibhai, felt betrayed. The fast by Patel has started drawing crowds of farmers and activists of Sangh Parivar at the main chowk adjacent to BJP office in Khanpur. Patel was the all-India publicity chief of the Swadeshi J a g r a n Manch (SJM) and is a respected figure in the RSS.

After three days of fasting, Patel looks rather pale. He is a simple man in his khadi clothes and welcomes all with folded hands but does not talk he is also observing silence ever since he began his fast on Wednesday evening.

""The undue harassment of the farmers by the state government has pained me and I have been left with no choice but to launch fast unto death as my sacrifice could save the farmers from being ruined by the Modi regime,"" Patel scribbled on a piece of paper when mediapersons reached the venue of his fast.

Laljibhai is the first RSS leader who has boldly criticised Modi, a former ''pracharak'' himself. Senior to Modi in the RSS hierarchy, Laljibhai hails from Vidaj of Kadi taluka of Mehsana and started his career as a teacher of mathematics and science in a high school at Siddhpur. Within a couple of years, he left teaching and joined RSS as a volunteer in Jamnagar in 1973-74.

Laljibhai went underground alongwith Modi during Emergency and carried out the programmes of Sangh Parivar in absence of senior leaders who were put behind bars in those days. It was during emergency days that the Sangh leader was forced to change his identity from Khodabhai Patel to Laljibhai Patel and since then he is known as Laljibhai.

3,MSEB recovers Rs 52 lakh from farmers,"PUNE: In just two days, the Pune circle of the Maharashtra State Electricity Board has managed to recover a whopping Rs 52 lakh in arrears from agricultural consumers in Pune district.

This is thanks to the Krishisanjeevani scheme, which offers a 50 per cent rebate on arrears.

A statement released by the MSEB office here on Friday said the recovery drive was implemented on January 21 and 22. It yielded the said amount from 2,826 consumers. The Krishisanjeevani scheme is applicable to those who have paid their April-September 2003 bill before January 31, 2004.

The statement said the state government had announced the concession on arrears till April 1, 2003, to be settled in three instalments,which are to be paid before March 31, 2004. A concession has also been offered on the amount of fine and the interest on arrears.

Since January 31 is the last date for the first instalment of arrears, the MSEB will keep its 11 billing centres open on the weekend â€” January 24 and 25. Three mobile billing vans will also be pressed into service at Talawade, Hinjewadi and Hadapsar.

Farmers who have been paying their bills regularly and do not have any arrears will also benefit from the Krishisanjeevani scheme as they will have to pay just half the amount of their next four bills, the statement clarified.

4,‘Organic farming need of the hour’,"PUNE: The Maharashtra Organic Farming Federation (MOFF) has intensified its drive to spread the concept of organic farming in the state.

MOFF core committee member Vikram Bokey told reporters on Friday that the federation had established a wide network of farmers and tillage experts from across the state.

â€œNearly 4,000 people have shown interest in adopting organic farming and have registered with us,â€� Bokey said, adding that 35 non-governmental organisations and 2,500 farmers were already practising organic farming.

He said farmers needed to get rid of chemical fertilisers and use traditional organic fertilisers and farming techniques to preserve the fertility of soil.

â€œWe have received around 50,000 letters in the past eight months from people interested in organic farming,â€� Bokey said. The MOFF is planning to form an apex body for promotion of organic farming and marketing of organic produce on a large scale, he added.

â€œThe objective is to promote sustainable agriculture, ecofriendly farming techniques and enable economic development through organic farming. We are also planning to open nine regional offices, in Thane, Sangli, Nanded, Pune, Jalgaon, Nagpur, Aurangabad, Ratnagiri and Amravati in a year,â€� Bokey said.

Nearly 60 per cent of farmers, who visited the â€˜Kisan 03â€™ exhibition in December, had shown a keen interest in organic farming. Several farmers in western Maharashtra have already adopted organic farming.

Bokey said the MOFF had approached the state and central governments and some foreign agencies seeking funds for its projects.

Various government organisations such as the Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture, irrigation department and the department of social forestry and non-governmental organisations Action for Agricultural Renewal in Maharashtra, Gomukh and Pani Panchayat were promoting organic farming, he said.

5,Congress rules out cabinet expansion,"CHANDIGARH: The Congress high command has ruled out expansion of the Punjab council of ministers, saying it would be against the spirit of the recent Act of Parliament which has restricted the size of the ministry to just 15 per cent of the strength of the assembly.

This was conveyed to Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh and his deputy Rajinder Kaur Bhattal when both had met the four-member committee in New Delhi on Thursday. The committee comprised senior party leaders Pranab Mukherjee, party general secretary Mohsina Kidwai, Manmohan Singh and Ahmed Patel.

The expansion of the council of ministers was part of the package deal worked out by the party high command early this month to defuse the crisis in the Congress Legislative Party (CLP) as almost half of the Congress legislators had raised the banner of revolt against Amarinder Singh.

Taking a U-turn, the party high command has decided against expansion. Though the government had been given six months'' time from the date of notification of the new Act to downsize, any expansion of the ministry would be in inconsonance with the Act.

Also, there was realisation in the party high command that the Act restricting the size of the government was made on the recommendation of the committee headed by Pranab Mukherjee and had been unanimously adopted in Parliament, and its violation would project Congress in bad light.

But to keep the aspirants for the ministerial berths in good humour, they have been told that the party was taking legal opinion on the issue.

There were at least half-adozen aspirants who had been elected to the state legislature for the second time, but had been ignored. A few of the legislators had even refused chairmanship of boards and corporations in hope they would be accommodated in the ministry.

But as the Lok Sabha elections have been advanced and the Act limiting the size of the ministry has become operational, the contenders for the ministerial berths too have realised that reshuffle of the ministry would be possible only after the Lok Sabha polls.

There were indications that the dissidents would also not insist on expansion of the ministry.

6,PTDC for partial disinvestment to make ventures viable,"PATHANKOT: The Punjab Tourism Development Corporation (PTDC) is awaiting the approval of the cabinet committee for the pending disinvestment of more than half-a-dozen hotels and restaurants. This is to generate more than Rs 50 crore to make the corporation''s operations viable. The other objective is to make the remaining ventures competitive so that they measure up to private hotels.

In an interview with Times News Network, PTDC chairman and Pathankot MLA Ashok Sharma said that the corporation has more than 350 employees on its rolls. He added that a majority of the employees are drawing handsome salaries.

Sharma said that after raising funds from ""partial disinvestment"" the Amarinder Singh government would like to offer Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VSR) to employees. The remaining funds, he said, would be used to make the remaining units economically viable.

The PTDC is in the red and has accumulated losses upto Rs 32 crore. The corporation has properties worth more than Rs 450 crore in Punjab and other states, he added. A hotel in Amritsar and more than five other outlets of the corporation would be privatised. Its rest houses in Wagah, Goa, Mussourie Dharmashala and Jaipur will be disinvested in the second phase of PTDC disinvestment. The PTDC had floated a holiday home scheme for its employees. The authorities had collected Rs 5000 each from those who had subscribed to the scheme. The scheme, however, failed due to lack of infrastructure and expertise. ""We will be able to return the money only after disinvesting some of our non-viable hotels and restaurants,"" said Sharma.

He said with many international tourists visiting Golden Temple and other religious places in Punjab and with opening up of the Wagah border, trade and religious tourism is certainly going to get a boost.

""We have started special schemes like giving 20 per cent rebate to Army people on room rent and would launch another ''thali'' system to give heavy discount to boost religious tourism in and around Pathankot as many people travel through Punjab on their way to Vaishno Devi.

Our other interest would be be to develop Ranjit Saghar Dam as a tourist spot,"" said Sharma.

He said the renovation of Gulmohar Tourist Complex at Pathankot and Coral Tourist Complex at Madhopur was on the cards.

7,Taj case: SC to consider Maya's arrest on Feb 13,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court will on February 13 decide whether the Allahabad High Court''s stay on the arrest of former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mayawati in the Rs 175-crore Taj heritage corridor scam was legal or not.

Former UP government standing counsel Ajay Agrawal, who has challenged the high court order, said the court had ""set a bad precedent by giving a blanket order of stay of arrest during the period of investigation"".

Adjourning the hearing till February 13, the court granted eight weeks'' time to the Centre to complete the inquiry against former Union environment secretary K C Mishra and chairman of the National Projects Construction Corporation S C Bali, accused in the Taj heritage corridor project case.

As Central Pollution Control Board''s counsel Vijay Panjwani said the CBI had registered the case against Mayawati and others only under the provisions of the IPC and the Prevention of Corruption Act and failed to comply with the court''s directive to book them under the Water (Prevention of Pollution) Act, 1974, the Bench said it would consider the matter in February.

8,HC: Bihar fit case for President's rule,"PATNA: In a severe indictment of the Bihar government, the Patna High Court on Friday termed its decision to recruit more than 34,000 primary teachers as nothing but an election stunt and observed that the court could certify that Bihar is a fit case for imposition of Presidentâ€™s rule.

Observing that the administration was being run in an abysmal and disappointing manner, a division bench said the court had tried to take the state fast on the path of development but â€œwe are disappointedâ€�.

â€œThe court is ready to certify that the state is fit for being put under Presidentâ€™s rule,â€� the division bench comprising Chief Justice (CJ) R S Dhavan and Justice S K Singh said while hearing a writ challenging the governmentâ€™s recruitment policy for primary teachers.

â€œYou (the government) did not fill any vacancy of teachers of primary schools since 1991. Now that Lok Sabha elections are round the corner you have applied Chanakyaâ€™s (the crafty thinker of ancient times) brains and advertised to recruit over 34,000 trained and untrained teachers without announcing any examination schedule and reserving over 70 per cent seats for women and minorities,â€� the judges, who sat for over three hours beyond schedule, said.

The court was hearing a writ petition filed by Nand Kishore Ojha and others challenging the recent decision of the state government for the recruitment of over 34,000 primary teachers in the state which was allegedly in violation of the norms of National Council for Teachersâ€™ Education (NCTE).

The hearing of the case came to an abrupt end on Friday with the CJ observing that the state government was â€œfooling the Central governmentâ€� on the appointment of primary teachers.

The bench directed Central government lawyer S N Pathak to apprise the Central government of the court proceedings. The bench posted the matter for hearing on January 27 even as advocate general (AG) Sashi Anugrah Narayan pleaded that he would make an effort to end the stalemate.

The CJ, according to Pathak, observed that the bureaucracy was a stumbling block in development. He asked the AG to call the chief minister to his chamber so that the matter could be thrashed out, Pathak said.

Pathak maintained that Justice Singh fumed at the secretary of primary education, who was present in the court, when the AG said â€œthe secretary was not satisfied with the courtâ€™s viewâ€�. Justice Singh said the secretary would be taken into custody for committing contempt of court. Then the AG tendered an apology on behalf of the secretary in order to save him from being taken into judicial custody. Exonerating the secretary, Justice Singh said such officials were the curse of the system, according to Pathak.

Pathak, speaking to journalists after the proceedings ended, said, â€œIt was for the first time that the Patna High Court sat till 7 pm. The honourable chief justice got up from his seat saying â€˜let us see where the cat goesâ€™.â€� Pathak said the NCTE gave a concession to the Bihar government in the matter of appointment of untrained teachers after it pleaded that there was shortage of teachers trained in recognised institutes.

Earlier, the bench said the Central government Act signed by the President of India should prevail in the appointment. of primary teachers. The NCTE Act makes it mandatory to appoint trained persons as primary teachers. When the AG submitted that the number of vacancies was too high as compared to the availability of trained teachers, the judges made an oral observation that redeeming measures had to be taken for appointment of primary teachers.

12,CMC seeks FIPB nod to sell residual stake of govt,"NEW DELHI: Moving ahead on the government''s plans to sell off its residual stake in the already privatised PSUs, IT firm CMC Ltd has sought the Foreign Investment Promotion Board''s (FIPB) nod to offload the Centre''s 26.25 per cent holding to non-resident investors through an offer for sale.

CMC will offer 3.97 million government shares for sale. While shares have par value of Rs 10 each, the offer price will be determined via book-building, the company said.

Enam Consultants, and HSBC Securities and Capital Markets (India), have been appointed as coordinator-cum-advisor for the exercise.

Stating the reasons for seeking FIPB nod, CMC said: ""The non-resident bidders in the offer for sale may include multilateral and bilateral development FIs, who may not be registered FIIs with Sebi. Therefore, we believe that the transfer to non-resident investors in the offer may not be automatically permissible.""

The company has already constituted an executive committee, comprising its CMD P Ramanan, CFO JK Gupta and company secretary Vivek Agarwal, to expedite the completion of the offer process.

The disinvestment ministry is also preparing an IPO for Dredging Corporation of India (DCI), which will be followed by the book-built market offer of the government''s residual stake in IBP and IPCL.

The Centre hopes to rake in Rs 1,200 crore from these offers.

The proposal of a public offer of 20 per cent of government equity in DCI and the residual stake in five erstwhile public sector enterprises â€” IBP, IPCL, CMC, VSNL and Balco â€” was approved by the Cabinet Committee on Disinvestment in July last year.

The government holds 98.56 per cent stake in DCI.

13,"Budget progressive, says minister","THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Kerala finance minister K Sankaranarayanan on Saturday denied opposition''s criticism that the state budget for the year 2004-05 presented on Friday was with an eye on Lok Sabha elections.

""The opposition has nothing to say about the proposals made in the budget and government will give priority for stepping up development works"", Sankaranarayanan told a meet-the-press programme here.

He said if any new schemes were announced in the Union budget, necessary adjustments to incorporate that in the state would be made in the budget.

To a question, he said it was expected that 90 per cent of the total plan outlay for the current year of rs.4350 crores would be utilized.

Rejecting the Karunakaran faction''s charge that health department had not been given sufficient allotment, he said the charge was baseless and an amount of Rs 110 crores had been earmarked for the department besides sufficient funds for setting up a Heart Foundation.

He said no discrimination was made while sanctioning constituency projects and schemes, as alleged by ""I"" group faction in the Congress in the state.

Meanwhile, addressing a press meet, opposition leader V S Achuthanandan charged that the budget only contained certain projects and schemes that could not be implemented.
