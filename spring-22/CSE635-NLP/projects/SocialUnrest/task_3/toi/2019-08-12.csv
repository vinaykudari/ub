0,CPM rules out tie-up with TDP,"GUNTUR: CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechuri has denied that his party was waiting for a tie-up with the Telugu Desam Party.

He said that the CPMâ€™s differences with the TDP were not only confined to communal issues but also economic issues.Giving reasons for the sudden slowdown in the agitations against the state government policies, he said the party was concentrating on strengthening its rural base.

In an exclusive interview with The Times of India on Saturday, Yechuri said, â€œYou will see wonders in the next Assembly elections. People are vexed up with the TDP and are also not ready to accept the Congress as an alternative. We are going to emerge as a strong force in the state.â€�

He said that the party gained strength in rural areas following the agitation against power tariff hike. The party asked its cadre to take up issues related to various tax hikes in the state.

The party felt that it was right time to emerge as a strong third alternative in the state, and it was working towards this end, he said.

Many people were of the opinion that the CPM was prepared to join hands with the TDP as soon as it withdraws its support to the BJPled NDA government at the Centre.

But the CPM differs with TDP mainly on economic polices. If Chandrababu Naidu was prepared to change his economic policies, the party would consider a tie-up with the TDP.

â€œHowever, I do not think it might be possible now,â€� said Yechuri.

Reacting to irregularities in petrol bunks allotment, he said that the NDA government was blackmailing the opposition instead of owning moral responsibility for the scandal.

1,Nitish upset at conduct of party leaders,"PATNA: Railway Minister Nitish Kumar has expressed his unhappiness over the conduct of his party leaders.

â€œI have left the post of Sarwamanya Neta (universally accepted leader) of the party,â€� he remarked before a section of mediapersons on Sunday.

He was commenting on the recent spate of statements issued by party leaders against each other, particularly involving MLA Shrawan Kumar and MLC P K Sinha. â€œInstead of speaking among themselves, they speak through the press,â€� he said.

â€œI am not mentioning any name. But I am pained that the party leaders are not showing restraint while taking the party issues to the press. I have informed George Fernandes about my feelings,â€� he said, adding that it was a misnomer that all Samata leaders accepted his dictates.

â€œI have withdrawn from the party affairs. I am, however, an active member of the party,â€� he said.

Speaking on the BJPâ€™s demand for action against Samata Party MP Prabhunath Singh, who had demanded the resignation of PM Vajpayee, Kumar said the politics of alliance had its â€œown responsibilityâ€�.

He, however, pointed out that the statements of Singh should not be viewed as the official stand of the party. Kumar refused to comment on the statements made by Trinamul Congress leader Mamata Banerjee on the bifurcation of Eastern Railway, but said the decision was final.

â€œThe work is going on to make Hajipur and Jaipur zones operational by October 1,â€� he said. â€œI do not want to comment on the Trinamul stir,â€� he said.

2,All-party team to visit Karnataka,"HYDERABAD: The government is planning to send an all-party delegation to Karnataka to assess the situation and subsequently take up the matter with the Centre in the wake of construction of new projects on upper Tunga by the Karnataka government, without sanction from the authorities concerned.

Chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu, who had already written to his Karnataka counterpart, is highly agitated over the attitude of chief minister S M Krishna in taking up new constructions in violation of awards given by the River Water Disputes tribunals.

According to official sources, the government wants to take the issue a logical conclusion by mounting pressure on the Centre to tame the Karnataka chief minister. Principal secretary (irrigation) J Harinarayana will be writing to the Centre raising the issue, to keep the ball rolling shortly.

The government had not taken any decision with regard to approaching the Supreme Court, but discussed the pros and cons of the issue with the officials of the irrigation and legal departments, before Naidu left for

Malaysia and Singapore. Naidu will also speak to Prime Minister A B Vajpayee after he gets a response from Krishna, it is said.

Meanwhile, the Congress on Sunday demanded that the chief minister call an all-party meet on river waters dispute with Karnataka and represent the same to the Center.

Party spokesperson Gali Muddukrishnama Naidu told reporters that the Congress was prepared to co-operate with the government to protect the interests of the state. He found fault with the CM accusing the Congress of failure to prevent the Congress government in Karnataka from constructing irrigation projects that are detrimental to the interests of Andhra Pradesh.

He clarified that the state units of the Congress had the freedom to take up issues that were in the interest of their respective states. He demanded that the CM mobilise elected representatives of all parties and agitate in New Delhi to force the Center to cancel permissions given to the Karnataka government to construct projects in violation of the Bachawat Award. He accused the government of inaction in spite of Karnataka taking up the Upper Tunga Project.

He said Andhra Pradesh could lose 2,500 MW of power and 45 lakh acres of irrigation if Karantaka went ahead with various projects. He appealed to the CM to rise above political considerations in the interest of the state.

He recalled that Deve Gowda who had become the prime minister with Naiduâ€™s support had issued clearances for the irrigation projects in Karnataka.

3,23 injured in Midnapur clash,"MIDNAPUR, West Bengal: Twenty-three people, including eight policemen, were injured when a group of CPI and CPM activists clashed with police at Jamtala village of West Bengal''s Midnapur district on Sunday, police said.

Trouble started when police expressed their inability to hand over the body of Sheikh Intaz Ali, cousin of Sheikh Shariya, deputy pradhan of the Jamtala panchayat, who had been missing since August 2, Inspector Incharge of the Kotwali police station Debashish Ganguly said.

He said that a team of Kotwali police officials visited Jamtala in the afternoon in connection with the ongoing inquiry into the whereabouts of Sheikh Intaz Ali, who has been missing for over a week now.

The group of CPI and CPM activists gathered there and started demanding the body of Ali, who they suspect to be dead.

They forcefully confined all the policemen in a room of Sheikh Saharia''s house and threatened to burn them alive.

But additional reinforcements were rushed to the spot and police resorted to lathicharge to disperse the group, which retaliated by pelting stones at the police personnel injuring them and damaging their vehicles in the process.

Local committee members of both the parties, who demanded dismissal of Ganguly for his unwarranted action, alleged police opened fire without any provocation.

Ganguly, however, denied that police opened fire at the group. He said that the situation continued to be tense with the activists still blocking the Keshpur-Midnapur road.

4,No govt team yet for Earth Summit,"NEW DELHI: With just a fortnight to go before the second Earth Summit begins in South Africa, India still hasnâ€™t decided on the men and women who will bat for the country there.

Nearly 100 heads of government will be attending the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD), but India is yet announce whether or not, its Prime Minister will attend the summit.

â€˜â€˜This will be decided a little closer to the date,â€™â€™ says an official. The external affairs and environment ministers are expected to be in Johannesburg but that too has not been announced either.

â€˜â€˜It will be an inter-ministerial delegation,â€™â€™ says an official. â€˜â€˜It is still being finalised, it will take a week. There is a long process to go through.â€™â€™ There is also hint of â€˜â€˜turf warsâ€™â€™ marring the coordination between ministries.

The environment ministry remains in the dark about the last-ditch efforts, made by hosts South Africa, to rescue the summit from almost certain stalemate by inviting 25 countries to help resolve differences ahead of the meeting.

An â€˜â€˜open-endedâ€™â€™ meeting â€˜Friends of the Chairâ€™, which was handled by the external affairs ministry, has yielded little result.

It is also not clear what India wants out of a summit which has a wide-ranging agenda.

Indiaâ€™s agenda, officials agree, is largely reactive. So, while it is â€˜â€˜interestedâ€™â€™ in the summit, it has no intention of dissociating itself from the process, â€˜â€˜it is slightly circumspect about the entire outcomeâ€™â€™, says one official.

The disenchantment comes from the stonewalling by a US-led group on issues dear to the hearts of developing countries â€” funds, capacity-building, transfer of technology â€” decided at theâ€˜â€˜path-breakingâ€™â€™ Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit in 1992.

5,Assembly polls jolt J&K parties,"NEW DELHI: The announcement of polls by the Election Commission without waiting for the culmination of various initiatives floated in Jammu and Kashmir has led to confusion, forcing parties concerned to re-position themselves.

According to Kashmir observers, the major impact is on the All-Party Hurriyat Conference (APHC), which is caught in the cross-fire and fighting for survival.

While its Pakistani backers expect the Hurriyat to toughen its stand against the elections, the international community wants it to adopt a passive posture, not disrupting the elections.

Sources say the Hurriyat will have to evolve a mechanism showing itself as a major player in the peace process.

At present, the Hurriyat appears to be taking refuge in the shadow of the Kashmir Committee, led by lawyer and MP Ram Jethmalani. But negotiations through this committee can at best be a face-saving device.

In simple words, the 23-party conglomerate has to prove its representative character. As an analyst puts it: â€˜â€˜There are several individuals and groups other than the Hurriyat who claim to represent the views of the Kashmiris. The Centre should not ignore them.â€™â€™

According to the Jammu and Kashmir Awami National Conference (ANC), led by former state chief minister G M Shah, the elections were called without proper preparations. â€˜â€˜The Election Commission has not revised the 1987 voters list. Thereby, it has ignored about four lakh young voters who have attained the age of 18 years since,â€™â€™ said Shahâ€™s son Muzaffar Shah.

Notwithstanding its objections, the ANC is participating in the elections as it is the only large cadre-based party in the Valley after the National Conference.

â€˜â€˜Apart from the threat of Pakistan-based militants, the Hurriyat leaders are shying away from the elections as not many of them have a mass following nor do they have cadres to campaign for them,â€™â€™ a senior state government official said.

This time, the Assembly elections are receiving international attention. This may compel political groupings to review and re-position their stand.

â€˜â€˜Therefore, eventually, the Hurriyat and other separatist groups may veer towards the elections. But the situation is still fluid,â€™â€™ a Kashmir observer said.

6,Condition unfavourable for Gujarat polls: Sonia,"NEW DELHI: Congress President Sonia Gandhi on Monday said ground reality in Gujarat was not favourable for holding free and fair elections and expressed confidence that the Election Commission will take a decision in this regard keeping the country''s interests in mind.

""As far as elections in Gujarat are concerned, we are confident that the EC will take a decision that is in the country''s best interests"", Gandhi said, addressing a General Body meeting of the Congress Parliamentary Party.

""The issue is whether the situation as it prevails today in the state is such that all people feel confident and secure in going out to vote in a manner they deem feet. That clearly is not the ground reality"", She said.

Gandhi said Congress was still awaiting answers to the 15-questions asked to Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani during the debate in Parliament on Gujarat.

About announcement of Assembly polls in Jammu and Kashmir, she said though it was announced but the NDA government has no no ""clear and consistent"" strategy to bring peace and harmony in the state.

She said depite the fact that Congress has extended unqualified support to the Vajpayee Government on Kashmir matters, ""it is the nation''s misfortune that this was not not fully exploited for the benefit of the state.

Rejecting trifurcation of Jammu and Kashmir, she said ""BJP may be votary of two nation theory. We are not. We are nationalist. We are secular. Our secularism aligned to our nationalism makes it inconceivable that we go along with the trifurcation of the composite state or with third party intervention"".

7,Kalam asks govt to expedite relief work,"AHMEDABAD: Seeking to give a healing touch, President A P J Abdul Kalam on Monday made his much-talked-about first official visit outside Delhi to a camp of victims of communal riots that was devoid of any controversy and asked the administration to expedite relief and rehabilitation measures.

Beginning a two-day visit to the state with a trip to Mahatma Gandhi''s Sabarmati Ashram, Kalam then drove straight to a relief camp amidst slogan shouting in Naroda Patia where 90 people were killed and hundreds injured in one of the gory incidents of violence following the Godhra carnage.

Moved by the plight of victims during a brisk 30-minute walk of the lanes and bylanes of the congested minority dominated area in the company of Chief Minister Narendra Modi, the President asked the Collector to expedite relief and rehabilitation work after he heard the victims that there has been ""gross negligence"" during and after the violence.

After his interaction with survivors of the three-month old carnage, he told the District Collector K Srinivasan that everything possible should be done so that the battered victims felt safe and secure.

Reflecting his special concern for children, an anguished Kalam told the collector that the child victims should be immediately put in school to restart their education.

Lest his visit caused any political controversy, a Presidential spokesman told reporters that Kalam did not give any instructions to the Chief Minister.

8,No political motive behind Kalam's Gujarat visit: BJP,"NEW DELHI: Asserting that the President A P J Abdul Kalam had no ""political motive"" in choosing to visit Gujarat first, the BJP on Monday urged the opposition parties not to ""politicise"" a purely ""sentimental occasion.""

""The President had been an admirer of Mahatma Gandhi since childhood. Instead of politicising the issue, his visit to Gujarat should be seen in the context of his sentiment to first visit Bapu''s birthplace,"" party spokesman Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said.

Dismissing any ""political motive"" behind the two-day programme which commenced today with visits to some relief camps, Naqvi said, ""the state government has extended full cooperation to him. The opposition should not politicise this purely sentimental visit.""

9,Friends plan a film on patriotism next,"BANGALORE: Mithra-Chithra, a group of friends who produced the award-winning Kannada film Athithi, will launch another film in October with Prakash Rai in the lead role.Rai told newsmen that the film is based on a Tamil short story which highlights patriotism.Rai appreciated the Mithra-Chithra troupe for producing films on a co-operative basis in which most members of the crew pool in money and produce a film. Rai, who took just Re 1 as remuneration for the movie, said when he heard that some of his old theatre friends like Seshadri, Panditha and Shashikumar were doing films, he thought he should encourage them. ``They have a pocketful of dreams and I thought I should make their dreams come true.'' He said that he did not consider Athithi a really great film. ``We may not do films like Ghatashraddha or the best films of 1970s. We are also not so worried about collecting crores at the box-office. But our efforts have been recognised at the national level. We are very happy.''

10,Violent protest by students in Ludhiana,"LUDHIANA: Students of Sanatan Dharam Senior Secondary School (SDSSS) on Monday morning threw stones at the school building.

They accused the management of not providing facilities to students and adequate pay and perks to teachers. Senior students of the school alleged the management had misappropriated over Rs 60 lakh to invest in new schools under it. Teachers had on their own decided to shun making money through tuitions but they had sought an increment in their salaries, which had seen no hike in the past four years. The management, in turn, sought an extra Rs 100 per month from the English medium students, and Rs 60 from Hindi medium students.

This was to meet expenditure on an extra class during recess and another after school hours. Besides, the increased salaries of teachers were also to be met out of this. The school management had signed an agreement with the teachers regarding a pay hike.

Sanjeev Mishra, a teacher, showed the signed papers to Times News Network. Teachers who had not got a raise in the last four years were given increments of Rs 1,500 to Rs 2,000 on August 10, 2002. It is learnt that, on Monday, the management, led by its president Prem Chand Gupta, Chaman Lal Sachdeva, and secretary Ashok Kashyap invited some parents and told them the fee hike had been consequent upon teachersâ€™ demand for a pay hike.

This irked parents, teachers as well as students and a violent demonstration ensued. Students of the senior classes alleged the trustees slapped a teacher, which eventually led to the violence. Finally, the police and the management had to push students out of the premises.

Principal Sadhana Sharma later said the management had granted a 60 cent pay hike to teachers students and parents were not satisfied. Rajinder Kumar, a parent, said the school had no water, power or other facility. He said only the managementâ€™s office the premises was equipped with a generator.

Hans Raj, another parent, was bitter about the school charging another Rs 50 month from students for computer class. He pointed out that there were merely five computers in the school and a class of 60 got to these for merely 30 minutes. Another parent complained the management charged 3,000 as admission fee, which no receipt was issued. This, he said, had gone into the starting of Shaiwal High School and its branch Rishi Nagar by the same trust.

11,Our govt will remove Devi Lal’s statues: Bansi Lal,"HISAR: Haryana Vikas Party (HVP) supremo Bansi Lal said at a press conference, on Monday, that they would remove all the statues and name plates bearing Devi Lalâ€™s name within 30 days of coming to power in the state. He was addressing mediapersons at PWD resthouse, Hansi.

He said, â€˜â€˜The government should install statues of war heroes, patriots and other great men.â€™â€™ He added that he was not averse to ousting the Chautala government, however, it would be a â€˜â€˜nobleâ€™â€™ deed if PCC chief Bhajan Lal â€˜â€˜freed the people of the misruleâ€™â€™.

HVP general secretary Surender Singh, who is also Bansi Lalâ€™s son, said that the party would would support Bhajan Lal if the need to engineer the fall of the INLD government arises. Bansi Lal emphasised, â€˜â€˜We donâ€™t need to have truck with any political party. The HVP will succeed in forming the next government in the next assembly elections.

It is just a rumour that I had met LK Advani recently.â€™â€™ Speaking about the petrol pump scam, he added that it was unreasonable to stall the business of the Parliament on the issue. â€˜â€˜I have no sympathy for Bhajan Lal in this regard. He owned the petrol pump since 1968. The BJP dragging in his name has surprised many.â€™â€™

12,Civil supplies minister to summon oil traders,"RAJKOT: Alarmed over the sharp rise in edible oil prices, the civil supplies minister Bharat Barot has called for a meeting of oil millers of Saurashtra and Kutch on Monday.

The meeting is aimed at warning the oil millers not to take advantage of the drought -like situation.

According to sources the minister has said that stern action would be initiated against the oil millers under the Packaging Act if they resort to any price rise.

While the oil millers have maintained that the price rise was due to the market forces and they had no hand in it, the minister is said to have told them that after the liberalisation of the policies there was no control on edible oil as it could be imported as and when required.

The sudden price rise on the groundnut oil front was attributed to the failure of groundnut crop in Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi and the heavy demand for groundnut oil in these regions. Deals for as many as 30 to 35 tankers were done in a single day on Saturday.

At present Saurahstra is getting groundnut oil from Jamnagar and Gondal. Usually during this season the oil millers in Jamnagar get around 4000 to 4500 bags of groundnut but during the last couple of days the arrivals have slowed down to just 2500 bags and hence there is a shortage of stock in these mills also, sources have pointed out.

The minister has asked the oil millers to ensure that the price does not go up during the ensuing festival season as any big price rise could affect the future of the next BJP ministry.

At present the prices have gone upto Rs 775 for a 16 kg tin which till late July were priced between Rs 600 and Rs 625. Mondays meeting between the oil millers and the civil supplies minister could well pave the way for either a price reduction or a price war.

13,Rs 57-cr project for tourism development,"DHARMSALA: The Himachal Pradesh government recently launched a Rs 57 crore programme under which a civil enclave will be constructed within the state at the Air Force airfield, Pathankot, to give fillip to tourism in Chamba and Kangra valley.

An official spokesman said that the development of civil aviation in Kangra district has been on the priority list of the state government. With the construction of a civil enclave at Pathankot, bigger planes like the Air-Bus and Boeing would be able to operate in the area. This would help in attracting quality tourists from foreign countries, the spokesman added.

He said that the airstrip at Kangra airport (Gaggal) was being extended upto 4,500 feet which would enable the Jet airways to operate in the region. He said that the state government had already given Rs 4 crore to the Airports Authority of India for the expansion of Kangra airport.

The Pong Dam has not seen many tourists for a long time. It was put back on the tourist map only two years ago. A restaurant at the cost of Rs 55 lakh is also being constructed within the dam complex for tourism promotion. He added that Rs 6 lakh was also being spent on the lighting of the water sports complex at the dam. He said work on another tourist complex near Nurpur at the cost of Rs 90 lakh was almost complete.

The spokesman said that keeping in view the potential for adventure sports at Kangra valley, an aero-sports centre-cum-forest field hostel was coming up at Bir, near Baijnath, at the cost of Rs 33 lakh. He said that an additional tourist accommodation had been constructed at Triund, Karaeri and Boh at the cost of Rs 21 lakh. A club-house at Mcleodganj would be another major attraction for tourists which is being constructed at the cost of Rs 1.55 crore.

The spokesman said that since the Kangra airport was assuming importance in tourist circles, Rs 22 lakh was being spent on the illumination of the Kangra fort. He said that the declaration of Pragpur as a heritage village has put it back on the international tourist map. Rs 8 lakh would also be spent on the beautification of Pragpur and Chanaur temple. The Archaeological Survey of India has undertaken the beautification work of the Masroor temple. Interested persons were also being trained in water sports, trekking, para-gliding and other adventure sports. At least 517 persons have been trained so far in tourist-training programmes on which nearly Rs 11 lakh has been spent.

They stated that the relief and rehabilitation measures were not adequate, and a sense of insecurity still prevailed among the people.

15,"No law to book a gutkha vendor, say police","MUMBAI: An anti-tobacco activist who caught a vendor selling gutkha on Monday got the shock of his life when the Azad Maidan police told him that there was no law under which they could book the vendor.

Vincent Nazareth of the Crusade Against Tobacco caught Vinod Chaudhary (22), a cigarette vendor, surreptitiously selling gutkha near Churchgate. Posing as a trader from Gujarat,Vincent coaxed him into selling off all his stock. When Vinod brought the sachets, Vincent caught him and took him to the police station.

Vinod was handed over to the Azad Maidan police station, where he has been put in a lock-up and will be produced before the magistrate on Tuesday. He has been arrested not for selling gutkha but for hawking without a licence. In fact, had Vinod furnished the bail bond of Rs 1,200, the police would not have detained him. â€œThere is no law under which can arrest a person selling gutkha,â€™â€™ inspector Sanjay Kadam of the Azad Maidan police station told TNN.

When Mr Vincent got information that Vinod, who runs a small kiosk near Churchgate, sold gutkha, he approached Vinod and told him that he would come after some time and buy all the gutkha he had.

â€œI rushed to the Azad Maidan police station which directed me to the Food and Drugs Administration. They simply washed their hands off, saying it was not their job, so I myself decided to apprehend the vendor,â€™â€™ said Mr Vincent.

16,Oil ministry looks at allotment rules,"NEW DELHI: The Union petroleum ministry is examining proposals from the three state-run oil companies â€” IOC, HPCL and BPCL â€” on how to reallot/freshly allot petrol pumps, from the post-2000 cancellations to future allotments.

The ministry issued on Friday, formal orders to the three companies to issue the cancellations right away. But the companies would like to wait for the decision on fresh allotment rules before doing so.

The matter has already gone to courts, with at least two notices being issued to the companies, on petitions from persons aggrieved at the cancellations. The original allotment orders had provisions for cancellation of allotments on a breach of certain conditions or for misdemeanours; these do not cover the mass cancellations on moral grounds, ordered by Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.

The original cancellation announcement said the allottees would be reimbursed what theyâ€™d spent on the outlets, however, this amount would differ from case to case. It is also unclear what such compensation could include. A issue linked with the cancellations is one of rebidding for the cancelled pumps. The ministry has already said the dispossessed pumps would be allowed to do so, too.
