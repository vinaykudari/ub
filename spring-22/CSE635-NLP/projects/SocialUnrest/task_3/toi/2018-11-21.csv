0,PMC to recover property tax from govt,"pune: the pune municipal corporation (pmc) has finally initiated steps to recover property tax from the state and central governments for properties constructed by them after 1995. speaking to the times of india, chief of pmc's property tax recovery wing hanumant chavan pointed out both the state and central governments had put up several new constructions in the city, including the impressive sugar commissionerate at shivajinagar and a building in the university of pune premises. according to existing rules, the assessment of government property has to be done by an independent officer who is not in the pmc's service. also, the appointment of such a person is required to be ratified by the state government. mr chavan said the state has recently cleared the pmc's proposal to appoint the former director of state town planning j.g. keskar as an independent officer. mr chavan made it clear that a delay in the assessment of the properties will not lead to concessions in the tax amount. the pmc would recover the taxes from the date the property was constructed, he asserted.

1,Promised govt grant denied to Vijayawada Corporation,"vijayawada:the state government has backtracked on its promise to release rs 3.84 crores as grant to the vijayawada municipal corporation (vmc), according to highly placed official sources. it may be mentioned that the state government had issued a go in july, 2001 sanctioning rs 3.84 crore (two instalments of rs 1.92 crore each) as road grant but till now not a single paisa has been released under this head. talking to the times of india on tuesday, the sources said that the municipal administration and urban development (maud) department has now informed the vmc that it was in no position to release the amount due to paucity of funds. now, the vmc finds itself in a very awkward situation as it has lined up over 50 works for development of roads in the city which are in a very bad shape. the civic body will now have to either give up the works or search for external sources for funding the road works. but no external agency is really willing to lend any financial assistance to the vmc in view of its miserable financial health. the vmc had given an undertaking through an affidavit to the high court a couple of months ago that it would complete over 41 road works by march 2002. the high court, acting on a public interest litigation, rapped the civic body for failing to take up road maintenance works in the last three years. following this, the vmc had drawn up a grandiose plan for relaying and repairing 150 roads in the city at a cost of rs 18 crore by the end of 2003-04 financial year. the first phase of the project was supposed to be taken up at a cost of rs 4 crore for 41 works. later, the vmc increased the estimates to rs 5.10 crore for 51 important roads which were in bad condition. the civic body had been waiting since july this year for the release of the rs 3.84 crore road grant by the state government. the civic body was all set to invite tenders for the 51 road works. the vmc authorities are now perplexed over the fate of the roads and about the implications if the works were not completed in time as promised to the high court.

4,Reservation policy losing relevance,"lucknow: government's reservation policy for backwards and scheduled cast/tribes would have no relevance in the era of globalisation as private companies would rarely adhere to it. so, it's high time a new policy of 'empowerment of backwards and downtrodden' be adopted to ensure social justice. this was the common refrain at the one-day seminar on 'affirmative policy and reservation for marginalised groups in india' organised by the department of sociology, lucknow university, on tuesday. chairman, state law commission, justice kn goyal said that reservation was meant to provide proper representation to the marginalised groups in government sector. but after globalisation, government jobs had started shrinking. as a result, the country today needed a comprehensive policy for the empowerment of these backward classes, he said. prof mohammad muzzamil said that studies have revealed that with the development of the county, social and economic inequality too have increased. he advocated a policy which had in-built measures to check inequality. prof sp srivastava, of lucknow university, was also of the view that instead of reservation, the backward should be provided with opportunities to develop their capabilities. in this context, former vice-chancellor, faizabad university, prof shiv mohan singh cited the example of vaniya tribe of tamil nadu, which had developed itself admirably without taking much government support. former chairman state backward commission, dr hs varma said that there were contradictions in the indian constitution and in the policies of the successive governments since independence. the governance promised in directive principal of state policy have been restricted by other provisions. he suggested that government should design separate policies for the backwards living in various state of the country according to their social, demographic and economic needs. inaugurating the seminar, urban development minister lalji tandon said that reservation policy had developed a bitterness among various caste, adding that the country needed a policy which brought 'equality' and did not discriminate among people. convener of the seminar, prof ak pandey was of the view that discontent was brewing among various upper caste against the reservation and that had been responsible for counter reactions, thereby dividing the society.

5,Cong seeks action against state minister,"lucknow: the uttar pradesh congress committee (upcc) has challenged the grounds on which chief minister rajnath singh is supporting poto despite the fact that a number of ministers in his cabinet have criminal records. in an official communique issued by media incharge of the party ram kumar bhargawa, the upcc questioned the role of state minister shiv kant ojha in the century scam. it said that ojha, against whom a case has been pending with the lok ayukt, was one of the frontline investors in century consultant limited and now he along with other ministers, who had invested in the ccl, was trying to save the prime accused. the communique stated that the legal notice was served on bhargawa when he openly charged ojha with investing rs 2 crore in the ccl in presence of one of its employees sn misra. however the recent induction of sn misra in the list of accused in the cc scam had once again supported the allegation of bhargawa, the release stated. seeking ouster of ojha from the state cabinet for conniving with the scam accused, bhargawa also urged the government to file a chargesheet against the minister under the 120 b (criminal conspiracy).

6,Sonia cracks whip on errant party MPs,"new delhi: congress chief sonia gandhi pulled up the party mps at the parliamentary party meeting on tuesday for not devoting enough time to parliament and wasting long hours in the central hall, instead. during the last session, being the main opposition party, it had failed to make an impact in taking on the nda government effectively. because most of the mps had absented themselves from important debates. sonia made a pointed reference to this practice and said she was concerned at the ""unsatisfactory levels"" of presence of congress mps in parliament, ""especially when important issues are taken up"". sonia was bland in suggesting, ""less time could be spent in central hall and more in the house."" she said that the congress must stand out by its presence in both houses. she urged the mps to take the parliamentary standing committees' meetings more seriously and use them to project the party's stand point. speaking in an assertive tone, sonia took an indirect swipe at maharashtra chief minister deshmukh over malegoan riots. ""malegoan should not have happened,"" she said sternly and stressed that she had been impressing upon the cms to be more vigilant and maintain peace. sonia's remark was significant as deshmukh had drawn flaks from the congressmen for inefficiency in handling the malegaon sitaution. they had also campaigned for his ouster. incidentally, this was the second time in the recent months sonia asserted herself. last week, at a special meeting of the senior party leaders and chief ministers, sonia had cracked whip for their inability to come out strongly against the prevention of terrorism ordinance (poto). laying down the party line, she had indicated that the party had spoken in one voice and launched a campaign against the bjp for bringing in the draconian law, without prior consultations with the political parties. sonia said flatly, ""we have thought long and hard about this legislation that was sprung on us without any prior consultation or discussion or interaction.....our considered conclusion is that the poto in its present form can not be supported by congress."" sonia further said that the congress would focus on the bjp's design to foment communal passions, flouting of court orders by the vhp at ayodhya and vandalism by the bajrang dal at the taj mahal.

7,Centre hints at early Manipur elections,"new delhi: the centre has hinted at the possibility of elections to manipur assembly taking place along with those in uttar pradesh and punjab in february-march next year. replying to the discussion on tuesday preceding the approval for extending president's rule in manipur for a second six-month term, home minister advani said the centre had no difficulty if elections were held in the state early next year. he said that though deciding the election dates was the prerogative of the election commission, the centre was ready to cooperate. ""if the election commission seeks the government's view, we will make that clear,"" he remarked when congress deputy leader in the lok sabha shivraj patil asked for a categorical assurance about the centre's intentions. replying to another question, advani said that in the peace talks with the national socialist council of nagaland (isak-muivah), the terms of reference had been significantly changed with the removal of ""without territorial limits"" from the agreement. when mani shankar aiyer (congress) insisted that in that case the government should produce the concerned document, the home minister said, ""if that was not the case, no talks would have taken place subsequently."" advani said the government had no intention to prolong the president's rule in manipur and deprive its people of the democratic rule.

8,Govt should heed fears on terror law,"new delhi: the tenor of the debate on poto is nothing but a massive vote of no-confidence on the state machinery that is to implement the draconian law. almost everyone, chief ministers and nda partners included, is agreed on the need for special laws to combat terrorism. but the almost uniform refrain is to prevent the ""misuse"" of the law and the need to have adequate ""safeguards"". this is an issue that needs fixing and the government will be well advised not to heed the advice of the mha and provide iron safeguards. principal among these is a provision for stiff penalties for those who misuse the law, and the need to enable those affected by its illegal use to obtain damages or compensation. the review mechanism, too, needs fixing. the current body is likely to be dominated by former bureaucrats and does not inspire much confidence. so far, the attack on poto has come from two different directions. the first from civil libertarians who cite examples of misuse of similar laws in the past. there's is a legitimate concern that the government must address even while pressing ahead with creating an effective legal instrument to combat terrorism. the second attack is from political parties ranging from the cpm on the left to the congress and nda splinters like the jd(u) and the inld. this is a largely political attack on the government which has taken great strength from shamelessly stoking fears that journalistic freedom will be threatened by the measure. the opposition would have used any instrument available to embarrass the government at this juncture. had it not been poto, the attack would have focused on disinvestment, labour reforms or any other cause that looked likely to yield political dividends. congress spokespersons claim the misuse of tada has persuaded them to oppose poto. but this was not the language heard when the law was around. congress chief ministers and administrative appointees did not hesitate to use or misuse tada. neither have they quite answered the criticism that state governments run by them use equally stringent laws to fight organised crime. but the most peculiar stand in this debate is the one taken by the national human rights commission. it has declared that there is no need for such an act and that existing laws cannot combat terrorism. but surely the chairman of the commission, a distinguished former chief justice of india, knows that existing laws have no provision for defining terrorist organisations or activity. and nor do they provide for blocking funds used to fund terrorism or the forfeiture of property acquired through terrorist actions. such laws do not cater for the unusually difficult task of gathering of evidence to convict terrorists, and, more important for obtaining information that could prevent terrorist actions.

9,Kerala may stop relief to clash victims,"thiruvananthapuram: the udf government was seriously thinking of putting an end to the practice of providing compensation for the losses suffered during political clashes, chief minister a k antony told the assembly on wednesday. replying to a submission by benoy viswam (cpi) on efforts to find a lasting solution to recurrence of violence in nadapuram in kozhikode district, antony said the experience had been that provision of compensation had not served as a deterrent to recurrence of political violence. however, the government would honour the commitment to provide compensation to those who suffered losses in the nadapuram clashes, mainly involving the muslim league and cpm, as that was part of the peace package, he said.

10,Cong exults over rally success,"bangalore: kpcc general secretary v s ugrappa on tuesday said the overwhelming response to the congress rally in channapatna on monday was a fitting reply to the claims of some political parties that they are the crusaders of the farmers and their issues. ``modern day duryodhanas and sons of soil (indirect reference to former prime minister h.d. deve gowda and his janata dal (s) members) should at least realise now that they do not hold the power of attorney for the farmers. the political drama they are enacting should stop,'' ugrappa told reporters here. he challenged the opposition parties to prove their allegations of malpractices by the congress in the bangalore city corporation elections.

11,Cong rally was a street-show: JD factions,"bangalore: ridiculing the congress `show of strength' at channapatna, both factions of the janata dal on wednesday said it was nothing more than ``domberaata'' (street show). state janata dal (s) president siddaramaiah rued that chief minister s.m. krishna and his cabinet colleagues had ``nothing to do but glorify one minister and cover up his mistakes.'' he alleged the government had collected about rs 3 crore from the liquor and excise lobby to fund the rally. ``it is sad that despite spending so much money, neither the cm nor his colleagues spoke about a single problem that is troubling the farmers. instead, krishna used his colleagues and turned the rally into a platform for attacking former prime minister h.d. deve gowda and his sons,'' he told reporters here. siddaramaiah said krishna owed his political resurrection to gowda. ``after losing the 1995 assembly elections, krishna had been relegated to an obscure corner. it was gowda, as cm, who generously gave him six votes to become a rajya sabha member. politicians should not forget the past,'' he stated. declaring that the rally was not an answer to jds challenge, siddaramaiah said: ``they did not even mention the two farmers who were killed in the police firing in vittalenahalli. our challenge was that they should go that village and face the farmers' wrath.'' siddaramaiah said the jds' agitation against the `anti-farmer' congress government would continue and outlined a programme of rallies in gubbi, bellary and bijapur. ``the congress has never held a farmer's rally before, so they don't know what they should say there. after all, their functions are held only to glorify either nehru or indira gandhi, rajiv gandhi or sonia gandhi,'' he said. jdu state president c. byre gowda said farmers were being exploited through such rallies. ``it is ridiculous that one party posed a challenge and another party is responding. the government did not announce any incentive for the farmers or addressed their issues. parties are only involved in proving a point,'' he said.

12,‘Mahato’s claims a political move’,"new delhi: there was a conspiracy to sully the reputation of the congress government which survived a no-confidence motion in 1993, former union home minister buta singh's counsel contended in the delhi high court on tuesday. resuming arguments in defence of buta singh, his lawyer rajinder singh, argued that jharkhand mukti morcha mp shailendra mahato's statement, on the basis of which buta singh was convicted, was three years late and was made at the behest of the opposition. buta singh, along with then prime minister p v narasimha rao, was convicted and sentenced to three years of imprisonment by a special court on september 29, 2000, for bribing four jmm mps to vote against the no-trust motion on july 28, 1993. they were held guilty of conspiracy under section 120-b of the indian penal code for bribing mps and under the provisions of prevention of corruption act. on february 26, 1996, mahato had made the allegation of bribery at a press conference organised by ram jethmalani, then an mp, and atal behari vajpayee, who was then an mp. questioning the credibility of mahato, singh said he made four statements and it was in the last statement that he added a conspiracy angle to the meeting of four jmm mps with buta singh and rao at the latter's residence. ''even if his statement is to be partly believed, it must be corroborated by independent evidence, which is not there,'' singh argued. mahato had stated that four jmm mps — suraj mandal, shibu soren, simon marandi and he — had gone to buta singh's house and from there they went to rao's residence.

13,IT for rural development,"pune: media lab asia, the ambitious research project aimed at bringing the benefits of information technology to the rural poor in the asian region, will seek to demonstrate the economic sustainability of internet and internet-based applications and show a linkage between such technology and economic and social development, according to its director michael best. mr best, in a presentation before the mahratta chamber of commerce, industry and agriculture on tuesday said that while striving to establish such linkages, the stress would be on smaller, cheaper and faster physical devices and the involvement of non-government organisations. media lab asia was established in september 2001 by the massachusetts institute of technology(mit) and the government of india. the project has identified tamil nadu as the area where it will demonstrate the benefits of offering access to computers to people using the village area network. such a network can be set up using wireless technology and installing equipment worth just $1000, and even this cost is likely to come down. in addition to chennai, media lab asia has identified maharashtra for experiments in health and bio-engineering, and kanpur-lucknow for experiments in rapid prototyping of personal fabricated sensors. the project will help create new domestic opportunities for indian it and communication industries. it will also add a new dimension of research to the university system by retaining bright students in the country, mr best said. according to him, the excitement of working on path breaking technologies which will shape the future of over six billion people of the world coupled with the attraction of the mit brand of research institution should be able to attract top talent. as in the case of mit's research everywhere, the research in india will be funded almost entirely by sponsorship money from the private sector corporation. media lab asia will encourage corporations to donate $100,000 as founding sponsors and share the commercial benefits of research.

14,Traders bandh fizzles out,"lucknow: the bandh call given by a faction of traders on tuesday turned out quite predictably to be a damp squib. mired into controversy soon after its announcement by the up yuva udyog vyapar mandal (upyuvm) and opposition by the lucknow vyapar mandal, it evoked a lukewarm response in most markets in the state capital. most shopkeepers chose to ignore the bandh call. many shops in busy hazaratganj, nishatganj, aliganj, sinha market, naka hindola, narahi, aminabad, la touche road remained by and large open. shops in some parts of janpath, daliganj, near it crossing, kapoorthala market, rajajipuram, pandeyganj, chandernagar, malviyanagar were closed for some time. earlier, the upyuvm activists led by their state president sandeep bansal took out a procession from their office at darulshafa and raised slogans in favour of traders unity and against the police, who, the traders alleged, were treating them like doormats and were indifferent towards their problems. traders also lambasted banwari lal kanchal, who recently resigned from the bjp and joined the samajwadi party (sp), for trying to divide the traders' unity and pushing behind the real issue for narrow gains. later, the leaders accused the police of trying to fabricate evidence after failing to catch hold of the real culprits who had killed the prominent kanpur-based jeweller roop chandra agarwal. in a separate statement, kanchal claimed that the bandh was a total failure. in another related development, the traders met chief minister rajnath singh and urban development minister lalji tandon late on tuesday evening. the delegation apprised both leaders of the ""grave injustice being meted out to them"" and sought their immediate intervention in the matter. according to sources, the chief minister allayed apprehensions of the traders that they would be harassed by the police and said that he would personally monitor the case. when told about the poor law and order situation in the city, rajnath singh said he would soon convene a meeting of crime control and law enforcement agencies. lalji tandon during his talks with traders rung up ssp bb bakshi and enquired about the progress made in the case.

16,Politicians rule the roost in Ghoghavadar,"rajkot: never to be left behind when it comes to gaining political mileage out of incidents of violence, leaders of all parties have converged on ghoghavadar village near gondal, which witnessed clashes between members of the patel and harijan communities recently, resulting in the deaths of a dalit and a police constable. the incident and the subsequent arrests have clearly assumed political overtones and leaders of the bjp, the congress and even some claiming to represent the dalits are targeting the local population and acting as their 'messiah'. members of the patel community told a visiting congress delegation that while they were for re-establishing peace in the village, the police had acted in a vindictive manner against members of the community. the patel samaj flayed the arrests of so many people belonging to the community. its leaders called for a unified fight against the police action and unlawful detention of people. the leaders said they would take up the issue at the highest level. leaders of the community, on condition of anonymity, said that it was the harijans who had triggered the violence by attacking patel households. yet the police were trying to make out a case which was just the opposite. they also said that some women folk were also taken into custody which amounted to an insult to the whole community. ghoghavadar, in the meanwhile, presents a picture of uneasy calm. a death-like silence greets visitors to the village which has seen large-scale migration by people from both the communities, following the police crackdown. dy.sp vm chauhan, the investigating officer, told 'the times of india' on tuesday that the entire village wore a deserted look and the few people who had stayed back were confined to their homes. not a soul was venturing out on to the streets. special igp p l jani and rajkot rural dsp ajay tomar also visited the city. when asked about the large-scale arrests, mostly of people belonging to the patel community, in the affected areas, the senior officers said, ""the crowd was in a volatile mood and to prevent any further escalation of violence in the already tense situation, the police resorted to arrests."" the duo claimed that the crowd had lethal weapons and had the police not swung into action, more bodies would have been lying on the streets of ghoghavadar. they defended their action saying the police had exercised restraint by not firing on the rampaging mob even though the force lost one of its men in the process. police officers at the village told 'the times of india' that it was after a gap of 16 years that the issue of removing garbage from near a 'mandir' had flared up. at that time, too, two people were killed in the violence. the police have registered a complaint against both the groups and seized some of the arms used in the attack. the situation in the village continues to be tense but under control, tomar said.

18,CEC blasts absence of intra-party democracy,"new delhi: chief election commissioner j m lyngdoh on wednesday launched a veiled attack on political parties not electing their leaders and said lack of democracy within parties reflected on the democracy of the country. he said a new breed of politicians had come up ""which is quite capable of milking the public finances and welshing the mutual funds. ""how can there be democracy in the true sense when there is little internal democracy in the political parties, where leaders of parties are not elected in certain cases,"" lyngdoh asked while addressing a workshop on 'money and democratic politics' here. admitting that there were instances of misuse of money in polls, he said besides the elected politicians, even those who fail at the hustings have shown that they can be influenced by powerful media houses and multinationals. ""it is now unabashedly admitted that media and mncs are more potent than the state itself,"" the cec said. he said overspending in elections was a universal phenomenon and india was no exception to that. ""the election commission has a limited role in curbing this and the entire society has to get together to get rid of this nuisance,"" lyngdoh said. earlier, senior congress leader salman khursheed and bjp leader k swain stressed the need for allowing income tax-free corporate funding in a publicly accountable and transparent manner. khursheed favoured a level-playing field for winners and losers in the funding. ""politics is an expensive business. where do we find money for parties and individuals? corporate funding should be allowed and made income tax free,"" khursheed said. he also favoured entry of ""good people"" in politics, even as he lamented that defections continued in the political spectrum despite an ""impressive anti-defection law"". swain, while disfavouring state funding as ""not practicable"", said corporates should be allowed to donate money publicly and these donations should be it-free. the two leaders differed on the having an interim administration just before the elections on the pattern seen recently in bangladesh. while khursheed favoured it, swain said the bangladesh experience could not be applied herqre. khursheed also said the congress was a mass-based party and wanted to be cadre-based like bjp while the latter was a cadre-based party wanting to be mass-based.

20,"Frame new terror law, Cong tells govt","new delhi: the congress on wednesday shed its ambiguity on the prevention of corruption ordinance (poto) demanding that it be put aside and a new terror law be framed if necessary. seeking to make clear his party's stand after much flip-flop on the issue, congress spokesman jaipal reddy said: ""we believe poto should be put in cold storage. if such a legislation is required, it can be examined de novo (anew)."" he said if the present laws like the national security act were not sufficient, they could be improved upon through amendments. in a clear hardening of stance, reddy said the congress would not accept poto even with amendments. ""we have no faith in this government. we don't think amendments would be sufficient''. he insisted that it be looked at anew in consultation with all political parties. the congress statement came just a few hours after the samajwadi party categorically demanded that the ordinance be withdrawn as no amendments were acceptable. opposition parties are also peeved that the government has not discussed the matter with them yet. reddy said the manner in which prime minister atal bihari vajpayee had shelved his own proposal for an all-party meeting on the issue was ""intriguing"". he said there had been no communication from the government on an all-party meeting to be held at a later date. the government had on tuesday indicated that such a meeting would be held at the end of this month or early december after the home ministry consultative committee had discussed the matter. the committee is scheduled to take up the issue on thursday. criticising the government for talking about a joint session to pass the proposed terror law, reddy said the congress believed ""such a controversial piece of legislation involving democratic liberties should not be rammed down the throat of the country through so severe a mechanism as the joint session."" the samajwadi party echoed this with party chief mulayam singh yadav saying: ""the government using the joint session to push poto means they will do it in any case and put opposition leaders behind bars."" characteristically aggressive, mulayam too said no amendments in the proposed terror law were acceptable and ""poto must go."" he said there was no need for amendments because despite any assurance from the prime minister or home minister, the police would interpret it the way they wanted. he accused the government of trying to use poto for political gains in uttar pradesh, saying the bjp seemed to be trying to project that ""only they can fight terrorism.""

21,US law will help India's rich biodiversity,"kochi: the just-concluded world wilderness conference in south africa was informed that the us would introduce a novel legislation to protect the world's most sensitive wilderness areas. one of the delegates t damu said the us move would allow the use of american aid to purchase timber and logging rights abroad. this was expected to prevent wanton destruction of tropical forest and wilderness wealth especially in the developing countries. embedded in this proposed legislation was the provision for sustainable development of the indigenous people and the communities dependent on forests. india was identified as the country with the richest biodiversity and wilderness wealth. but the population pressure was telling on the system, it was pointed out. global measures are thus expected to help preserve the remaining system. ""visionary project"", another new method mapped out in the conference to link up four southern african countries in a 26,000 sqkm wilderness was also expected to be something worth emulating in the south asia, it was pointed out.

""we are yet to ascertain what is missing from the house. the jewellery remains untouched. but the house has been ransacked; it looks like the killers were searching for something. there seems to be no resistance from the couple in letting the killers in,"" the police said. apart from this, the pet dog seems to have made no noise, the police added. police presume it to be a murder over a personal grouse or for vengeance. repeated stabbing with a knife strengthens this theory. ""we feel it is someone known to the couple since they gained access into the house easily,"" a police officer said. jawahar was seen in a nearby department store around 9 pm on monday and the couple were found dead early on tuesday. the murder could have taken place on monday night. since jawahar's father has held prestigious postings in the government, the police are looking into whether he had any enemies. ""jawahar lived on his own and never kept cash at home,"" his friends said.
