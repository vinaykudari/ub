0,Expansion of ministry after polls: Amarinder,"BATHINDA: Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh has hinted at making cabinet expansion after conclusion of assembly election process in five states in the country.

He said that senior Congress party legislators and some women legislators will get a berth in the next cabinet expansion.

Speaking to media persons at Mauj Khera village, near Abohar, at the residence of Sunil Jakhar, the chief minister said that the expansion would be made under the guidance of AICC president Sonia Gandhi.

He termed the November 23 ""rasta roko"" organised by Akalis a complete flop. He said that any attempt to disrupt the normal life in the state on December 1, when former chief minister and his family had been summoned by a Ropar court, will be a direct interference in the functioning of judiciary.

Amarinder was accompanied by PPCC president HS Hanspal. The leaders were going to address public rallies at Sriganganagar in support of Congress party candidates.

The CM said after putting all corrupt Akalis behind bars for indulging in corruption during 1997-2002, the BJP leaders would also be dealt with in similar manner. He alleged that the BJP leaders were ""quite intelligent in hiding the money made through illegal means"".

If the Akalis were caught easily, nailing the BJP leaders would be bit difficult, he added.

1,PSHRC seeks govt's report,"CHANDIGARH: Taking suo motu notice of human rights violations of a 14-year-old boy who had reportedly been tortured by the Patiala Police for ''committing theft'', the Punjab State Human Rights Commission (PSHRC) has asked the state home department and senior district police officials to submit a report before it by March 25, 2004.

Terming the case as a violation of human rights, the PSHRC issued an order on Tuesday calling for a report of the state government through its principal secretary (department of home affairs and justice), IGP (litigation), DIG Range and Patiala SSP.

According to the commission order, Sanjeev Kumar (14), a resident of Ahru Kalan village under Julkan police station in Patiala, had gone to a wedding in the family of Faquir Chand of the same village on November 22.

Local residents reported that the family members raised an alarm saying that some cash, garments and sweets had been stolen from the venue. Sanjeev''s nightmare began from there.

The boy was reportedly identified by the village panchayat as the main accused in the theft and taken to the police station where he reportedly admitted to have stolen Rs 500 besides some sweets.

According to the order, Sanjeev told the police that he would return the money if he was allowed to go home.

The panchayat members then took Sanjeev to his home but he allegedly denied of having stolen the money, while saying that he had admitted of the theft because of fear of the police.

Sanjeev was again brought back to the police station and allegedly beaten up by the police. The order observes that the police station staff though maintained that they did not beat up the boy.

Sanjeev was allegedly admitted to Government Rajindra Hospital. Though he did not have any grievous injury marks, he showed signs of being scared, the order states.

Patiala SSP A S Rai had reportedly suspended the investigating officer in the case, Ramji Dass, and initiated a departmental enquiry against him.

The order further observes that the SSP had said that the case appeared to be of political rivalry among two village factions and that no case had been registered in that connection.

2,Women's panel sees red over violent films,"BANGALORE: In the Manisha Koirala-starrer Market, a call girl is killed because she refuses to accompany her client.

â€˜Nee nanage sigadiddare acid hakuveâ€™ (If I donâ€™t get you, I will pour acid on you) â€”is a song in the Darshan-starrer Kannada film Kariya.

Concerned over films and songs perpetuating violence against women and â€œheroesâ€™â€™ threatening girls with dire consequences if they do not fall in line or love, the Karnataka State Commission for Women has shot off a letter to the censor board to ban such movies.

â€œThe sensational Shruti acid case is a perfect example of how our youth get inspired by movies and practise it in real life. I will also write to the state government to withdraw subsidy for such movies, which perpetuate violence against women,â€™â€™ womenâ€™s commission chairperson Philomena Peres said.

According to her, such movies have encouraged crimes against women. â€œShowing a rape scene or blackmailing a girl over the phone and scaring girls are imitated from films. The censor board must be more sensitive while clearing such movies.â€™â€™

The censor board is often looked at as an â€œinterference boardâ€™â€™, says H.V. Krishnamurthy, regional officer of Central Board for Film Certification, the authority which approves films produced in Karnataka.

â€œWe are trying our best to restrict violent scenes and dialogues in movies. But then, the board is alone in this battle. Public opinion should be built up on such matters.â€™â€™

Sometimes, the certificates issued by the board â€” U, UA and A â€” for films are not displayed. â€œThough we categorise movies for a specific audience, if the certificates are not displayed, the purpose is defeated,â€™â€™ he said.

The film industry, however, contends that the very concept of censor itself is meaningless. Ramu, who produced Kannada film Nanjundi where the â€œarrogantâ€™â€™ heroine throws acid on her teacher, said: â€œCensorship is meaningless because people are already watching everything, from violence to sex, on TV without paying a single paisa. So why target films?â€™â€™

Still, Peres felt: â€œI think we should get back to our good old romantic movies where the hero and heroine are traipsing around the trees.â€™â€™

3,"Datta Jayanti will be peaceful, says minister","CHIKMAGALUR: Datta Jayanti will be peaceful and incident free, hoped housing minister C.R. Sageer Ahmed here on Tuesday. He told reporters he said that the government will take steps to ensure smooth going of the affair and said that for several years the jayanti being celebrated in the Bababudangiri and the programme supervised by the Mujarai Department will be peaceful.

He criticised the BJP for politicising the jayanti for gaining political mileage. He said that extending co-operation to the BJPâ€™s design is left to the people.

He said that the government can prohibit a religious programme but the same day two types of jayanti was not acceptable as it is no in the interest of maintaining law and order.

He said that Congress candidate D.M. Puttegowda will win the ensuing Legislative Council poll from the local body constituency and the voters will assess performance of the government and vote for Congress.

CPIâ€™s resolve: Notwithstanding the district administrationâ€™s request to postpone the proposed harmony meet on December 7 and 8 by the All India Youth Federation in the city and at Bababudangiri, the CPI is bent on holding it.

B. Amjad, CPI district secretary told reporters the party was ready to meet any eventuality and will counter the designs of the BJP which has termed it as Ayodhya of south India.

He said now the BJP by equating this issue with the Ayodhya has politicised the issue and CPI will also counter this move as a political party and will not budge from its stance to hold the meet on December 7th and 8th.

He said the programme is being organised by the district administration and CPI and AIYF will participate to bring in communal harmony among Hindus and Muslims. They alleged that some communal forces are trying to hijack the fair.

4,Murmurs over selection process for CBI top job,"NEW DELHI: The selection process for the new CBI director is raising eyebrows among top IPS officers. The present CBI director, P C Sharma, retires on December 5.

Highly placed sources said that the cabinet secretary had recommended the names of 11 seniormost officers to the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) â€˜â€˜for considerationâ€™â€™. These officers fulfilled the criteria laid down by the Supreme Court.

But apprehensions are being expressed in top IPS circles that the criteria laid by the apex court is being â€˜â€˜bypassedâ€™â€™ by the CVC which has â€˜â€˜shortlistedâ€™â€™ only four of the 11 officers for the post on the basis of their having worked in the CBI before. These four officers are from the four seniormost IPS batches of 1965, 1966, 1967 and 1968. The seniority of the other IPS officers in these batches has been ignored.

The four shortlisted officers are: K Chakravarty, director-general of police, Gujarat (1965 batch); S C Chaube, DG, Central Reserve Police Force (1966 batch); B B Mishra, special secretary, Home, (1967 batch); U S Mishra, special director, CBI (1968 batch).

In the matter of selection of the CBI director, the SC had laid down the criteria in a judgment suggesting that the designated committee shall draw up a panel of IPS officers on the basis of their seniority, integrity, experience in investigation and anti-corruption work.

Sources alleged that the â€˜â€˜limited meaningâ€™â€™ given by the CVC (that is, previous experience of working in the CBI) to the criteria laid down by the apex court ignores the officersâ€™ experience in investigation and anti-corruption work.

5,Congress protests anti-Bihari move,"PATNA: The Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee (BPCC), under the leadership of its president, Ram Jatan Sinha, took out a ""protest march"" here on Wednesday, in protest against the treatment meted out to Biharis all over the country.

The march started from Gandhi Maidan.

The processionists burnt the effigies of deputy PM L K Advani and Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray at Dak Bungalow chowk. Speaking on the occasion, Sinha held the Union government solely responsible for all the violence against Biharis, since despite repeated requests from Assam government it did not provide more para-military forces to quell the violence and adopted dilli-dallying tactics.

This ""step motherly treatment"" of the Union goverment to the Assam government encouraged opportunist and divisive forces endangering unity and integrity of the country.

Expressing his shock over the treatment meted out to Bihari students by Shiv Sena in Maharashtra, Sinha said had the NDA government taken initiative the incidents there could have been controlled.

Thackerayâ€™s reported statement against ""outsiders"" added fuel to the fire.

But since the Shiv Sena is one of the constituents of the NDA government, the BJP is also responsible, he stated adding that PM and Advani should have taken initiative to stop Shiv Sena chief from making such ""irresponsible"" statements.

6,City designer weaves her way to distinction,"HYDERABAD: Reviving handloom designs, which disappeared in the course of time, is what 73-year-old Suraiyya Hassan Bose has spent her whole life doing, and today she holds the monopoly in production of six such designs.

Owner of Safrani Traditional Himroo Weaving Centre and Safrani Exports Private Limited, located at Darga Hussain Shah Wali, she has developed and produced about 100 â€˜ikatâ€™ designs.

The centre specialises in the designs like mashru fabric, paithani, himroo, jamawar,â€™ ikat telia rumalsâ€™ and many more.

The centre does not supply to retail outlets but has individual customers all over the country and also in many foreign countries, especially in Europe. An all-woman team works on in the centre which has ten looms.

Needy widows, have been identified and are being trained to become self-sufficient, Suraiyya Hassan told The Times of India. The workers are given three-year training before they start weaving.

All the patterns developed are more than 50 years old. The rare designs produced here are not available elsewhere, except in Aurangabad, she claimed.

This is a highly time-consuming task and requires skilled hands. The cost is high in terms of the labour too. For instance, two weavers, working on one loom, can produce only six inches of â€˜jamawarâ€™ design per day. The material itself costs about Rs 750 to Rs 1,800 per metre.

Himroo is a Persian art, which the Mughals brought along to our country and it is now available only here and in Aurangabad. â€œBut in Aurangabad, the designs are set on machines while they are hand-made here,â€™â€™ she said.

The other exclusive techniques include paithani border on khadi yarn, ikat technique in durry-weaving, cotton and jute durry designs, traditional ikat telia rumals, Kanchanpalli and Kalamkari designs and many more. Designs can be made to order on bed sheets, table cloths, sarees, borders of sarees, stolls, shawls, floor coverings and even Janamaz (prayer mats).

The business was started by Suraiyya Hassanâ€™s father, a freedom fighter, Syed Badrul Hassan in 1925, who revived the Bidri craft and established the Mettupalli Khadi Cooperation Society in Karimnagar.

After working as an assistant manager in Leepakshi Emporium, Suraiyya worked in the State Trading Corporation of Andhra Pradesh. She also studied in London.

Customers from Europe, New York, and other parts of the country fly down to her centre to select samples. Customers at home include the Fab India and NIFT.

7,No arrests yet in IDL blast case,"HYDERABAD: Cyberabad police commissioner M Mahender Reddy on Wednesday said the police were yet to take anyone into custody in connection with the explosion that ripped apart the detonator fuse unit-II at the Gulf Oil Corporation (formerly Indian Detonators Limited) facility in Kukatpally on Tuesday.

The police on Wednesday confirmed eight deaths, with a body still to be recovered from the debris. Of the five who were injured, one is in a critical condition.

About the speculation that the explosion was due to the use of a cell phone by a worker, he said it was difficult for the employees to enter into the company with cell phones.

However, preliminary investigations by forensic experts revealed that one of the deceased workers had entered the unit with a CDMA phone which had high radiation rating. He is said to have pressed a button to receive a call at 3.25 pm triggering the blast, sources said.

9,"In Bastar, politics is dirt cheap","JAGDALPUR: Making people listen to political leaders comes very cheap here. Even buses are not needed to bring in people for political rallies. Large lorries, packed with tribals, do so. And the people are lucky to be paid Rs 10 for listening to the speeches.

At least that was the rate for a rally last month when many were not even dropped back. The Prime Ministerâ€™s rally here on Wednesday seems to have been different with trucks returning the â€˜â€˜massesâ€™â€™ home.

Then, Rs 10 is all they get for a dayâ€™s work in the fields. Welcome to Bastar, one of the poorest regions of the country. There is only one crop of paddy here and this is harvest time. Even those with 10 acres, probably the biggest land-holders, go out to othersâ€™ fields for harvesting and are paid Rs 10 each for cutting the crop and later Rs 25 for bundling it and taking it home.

â€˜â€˜Even if they can do without this Rs 10, they cannot afford to hire labour at a higher rate from elsewhere for their own fields, so harvesting becomes a communal affair,â€™â€™ explained Hilurius Ekka, a teacher in the Mariguda village school.

Contrary to popular perception of Bastar being an impenetrable jungle, there are huge tracts of plains without any forest cover.

Mariguda is just five km short of the Orissa border and is on the edge of a dense forest. But to reach there, one has to travel around 40 km into the countryside with nothing but fields of ripe paddy on either side of the road.

And what ought to be fertile land lies fallow for want of water after December till the next monsoon. Barely five per cent of the farmers cultivate vegetables. So the rest of the year, they are dependent on some menial labour or the other.

â€˜â€˜In summer, we go into the forests to pick tendu leaves. Two people can make up to 100 bundles a day for Rs 45. Some migrate to towns for work and then there is always the kanda root. It is good for health,â€™â€™ said Damrudhar, a youngster, mocking at the very question. Those living away from the jungles walk 20 to 30 km in summer to dig up the root.

10,Vasundhara rules out a hung verdict,"BIKANER: BJP chief ministerial candidate Vasundhara Raje on Thursday ruled out a hung verdict in the Rajasthan assembly elections. If need be, she said, her party was not averse to a coalition government.

â€˜â€˜I donâ€™t think coalition could be a problem,â€™â€™ she said during a whirlwind election tour of Bikaner division, where Jats have a sizeable presence and where she is called a â€˜Jat bahu.â€™

The Rajasthan BJP chief said people of the state were fed up of the Congress government led by Ashok Gehlot.

On a tour of Nagur, Bikaner and Sikar districts, Raje, who was brought to the centre stage of Rajasthan politics a year ago, said, â€˜â€˜We have learnt to live with coalition politics.â€™â€™

Vasundhara dismissed reports that the Indian National Lok Dal, an alliance partner of National Democratic Alliance at the Centre, had entered the state electoral arena in a big way to break the presumable stronghold of Congress on Jats, who are said to be influencial in about 80 of the 200 assembly seats going to the elections on December 1.

11,CAS II: Wait for the polls to get over,"NEW DELHI: Conditional Access System (or CAS) is the one issue conspicuous by its absence in the pre-election heat and dust. While thereâ€™s not a word on the deferred cable TV act in the manifestos of the Congress and the BJP, consumers will soon wake up to cable TV blackouts and higher prices.

Upset over the non-implementation of CAS, the cable TV fraternity is waiting for the elections to get over before launching a full-fledged agitation. Large cable operators (or MSOs) say they have invested over Rs 500 crore in creating the infrastructure for CAS, and a price hike is inevitable.

â€˜â€˜If CAS is further deferred, our economics will not work out, and prices will go up,â€™â€™ says Hathway CEO K Jayaraman. Whatâ€™s more, itâ€™s also the season for broadcasters to hike pay channel rates. ESPN-Star Sports, for instance, has already indicated that its monthly rate will go up from Rs 32 to Rs 42. Two new channels will add to the burden.

As things stand, the I&B ministry has postponed CAS in Delhi, and left its implementation in Mumbai and Kolkata to the state governments. Chennai is the only city with CAS, but only 10,000 subscribers have bought or rented boxes. The majority have restricted their cable viewing to around 50 free-to-air channels for Rs 72.

Industry is also awaiting Delhi High Courtâ€™s verdict on the postponment of CAS in the city. The court has reserved its verdict.

Industry admits the problem is lack of cooperation among the government, broadcasters and the cable fraternity. The result: over 2 million set-top boxes are sitting idle with MSOs. â€˜â€˜There is no point putting pressure on a weak government. MSOs and broadcasters have to sit together and decide on a new date to implement CAS,â€™â€™ said Ashok Mansukhani of InCablenet.

And the pay channel broadcasters â€” who have been dilly-dallying on CAS â€” now feel set-top boxes have to be made mandatory for free-to-air channels too. â€˜â€˜This is the best way to solve the problem. Consumers have to be educated to buy a set-top box to get basic-tier channels for Rs 72,â€™â€™ said a foreign broadcaster. Meanwhile, DTH is widening the market. Subhash Chandraâ€™s Agrani claims to have entered over 30,000 non-cable homes.

12,CAT date clashes with CDS exam,"NEW DELHI: The new date for Common Admission Test (CAT) to six IIMs has come as a shock to thousands of students. For, February 15 is the day when the Combined Defence Services (CDS) entrance exam will also be held.

Though management and defence services may be two entirely different fields, a large number of students appear for both exams. With the job market becoming increasingly competitive, students are forced to explore various career options.

â€˜â€˜I filled up both forms months ago. The CAT getting cancelled was a huge disappointment in itself and now things are even more complicated,â€™â€™ said Vikrant Sharma, who had applied for both the tests.

The CAT exam was rescheduled after the question paper was leaked on Sunday. The exam for CDS lasts an entire day and is conducted in three stages, with one hour breaks between each stage. The first phase begins at 9 am and the last paper ends at 5 pm. With the CAT timings being from 11 am to 1 pm, students say its impossible to attempt both.

â€˜â€˜I have spent more than Rs 20,000 on tuitions for CAT and Rs 10,000 on training for the SSB interviews. All the hard work of the past one year will go waste now as Iâ€™ll be able to appear only in one exam,â€™â€™ said Nitin Sharma.

13,Demand for shifting of TV centre due to riots,"AHMEDABAD: In a shocking development, the Association of Radio and Television Engineering Employees, has demanded the shifting of the low power TV relay centre in Modasa town of Sabarkantha district on account of problems faced during the riots.

This will be the second such instance in Sabarkantha district which was forced to stall the inauguration of its new Regional Transport Office (RTO) reportedly on the ground that it was located in a minoritydominated area.

The ARTEE had put forth their demand during the state convention held at Ahmedabad earlier this month, which was principally accepted by the engineerin-chief (Doordarshan) RK Gupta, said a release.

They had said in the meeting that several of their staff had experienced problems during the riots.

The release by publicity secretary Ashok Mantri said that Ellisbridge BJP MLA Bhavin Sheth had also assured help in the matter. Sheth, however could not be contacted.

14,GEB to crackdown on farmers indulging in power theft,"VADODARA: For years power theft and illegal connections have ensured that the GEB remains among the top loss-making electricity boards in the country.

In the last year, however, there has been a sea change with the vigilance department registering a 346 per cent increase in detecting irregularities including theft and illegal connections.

This is expected to rise in the coming months with the Board planning a major drive against farmers illegally converting a single-phase power supply into a three-phase to run their pumps for more than eight hours a day.

According to sources, GEB loses about 100 transformers every day because of the excess load that the converters put on them.

â€œWe have increased the number of mass checking drives by more than 60 per cent,â€� said GEB director of security and chief vigilance officer Gurdial Singh.

â€œAlso we have started registering FIRs and arresting those indulging in irregularities and all this has led to a substantial increase in GEBâ€™s revenue.â€�

Singh added that in the last two years, GEB has lodged nearly 900 FIRs and arrested not less than 762 persons for various crimes. The officials have also nabbed five gangs that were helping industrial units in power theft.

The arrests include 10 GEB officials, many of whom were caught red-handed while aiding and abetting theft. And each time a drive is successful, it directly reflects in the monthly revenues of the Board.

In October last year, the Board had collected Rs 755.39 crore. Correspondingly this year, the figure has shot up to Rs 821.41 crore. In September last year they earned Rs 724.40 crore.

This year it was Rs 804.79 crore. GEB has initially started targeting businessmen in Surat and north Gujarat, especially Mehsana,which they see as theft-prone areas. Singh had said then that he wanted to send the message that people will not be spared just because they are influential and have contacts with politicians.

Apart from Surat, Rajkot, Bhavnagar, Amreli, Surendranagar and Kodinar are some the other areas which are seen theft-prone. With this, theft in industrial units has started to wane and the focus has shifted to the farm sector.

â€œWe will launch a drive against farmers who have been illegally using converters to use three-phase power when the GEB is providing single phase. Because of the healthy rainfall this year, farmers are not satisfied with the three -phase power that we provide for about eight hours each day. The converters put so much load the sub stations that that entire transformers are blown up.â€�

According to Singh, farmers are contributing about 30 per cent to the total transmission and distribution losses of the Board at present, something they canâ€™t afford as they are already giving a subsidy of about per cent to the farm sector.

Officials have started collecting information on areas where converter-use in extensive to start the crackdown.
