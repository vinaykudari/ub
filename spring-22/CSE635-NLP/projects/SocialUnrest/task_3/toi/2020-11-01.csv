1,Union minister offers help to farmers,"MADHUBANI: To combat growing poverty and unemployment in the country, agriculture needs to be made profitable which cannot be done merely by subsidising governmental procurement of food grains.

Even the staggering amount of Rs 27,000 crore spent annually on subsidising procurement of wheat and paddy has achieved little. Despite governmental support price, a vast majority of farmers have to sell their produce at unprofitable market price, Union agriculture minister Raj Nath Singh said here on Saturday, while inaugurating the week-long All India Agricultural Fair.

The fair, sponsored by National Horticulture Board and organised under the aegis of Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) run by S K Chaudhary Educational Trust, Basaith-Chanpura, will conclude on November 5. Singh further said that in view of the need for massive capital investment in the field of agriculture, the Union government would instruct all the banks to bring the rate of interest on all agricultural loans at par with consumer loans.

Besides, a new insurance policy, under which, instead of insuring the standing crop, the per hector produce will be insured and the difference amount of support price and market price will be paid to the farmers by the insurance companies. Earlier, S K Chaudhary welcomed the guests and apprised the audience about the activities of the KYK. Shiva Shankar Yadav, state minister for agriculture, was the special guest on the occasion.

2,"Change inauguration date of fair, govt urged","SONEPUR: The inauguration of world famous Harihar Kshetra Sonepur Fair on November 7 by chief minister Rabri Devi would not be auspicious for the visitors and the chief guest, RJD supremo Laloo Prasad Yadav, because â€œchaturdashiâ€� falls on the eve of Kartik Poornima, predicting this on Wednesday at the Gajendramoksh Ashram built on the banks of the Gandak river here, Jagatguru Luxmanacharya said that the commencement or inauguration of fair, which is visited by lakhs of devotees, on â€œchaturdashiâ€� would damage peace and prosperity of fair.

The Sonepur fair has lost its sanctity because it has been inaugurated for last five years on â€œchaturdashiâ€�, which is considered inauspicious, said Luxmanacharya. Anguished at the â€œunholy moveâ€� of the state government, Luxmanacharya had decided to mark the beginning of Sonepur fair on November 4, the day of â€œdevotthan ekadashiâ€�, which is considered auspicious for beginning of public fairs or new things.

Talking to TNN, Laxamanacharya said a â€œkalash yatraâ€� would be taken out on November 4 from the Gajendra Moksha Ashram to all areas of fair. The holy kalash yatra of 108 holy Kalash would conclude at Gandak after passing through the fair, added Luxmanacharya. Luxmanacharya has requested the state government to change the date of inauguration of fair from November 7 to November 4.

3,RJD supremo takes a dig at political adversaries,"PATNA: Once RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav gets onto digging at his political adversaries there is no holding him. Speaking to mediapersons at 1 Anne Marg here on Saturday, he called leader of the opposition in the Bihar assembly Sushil Kumar Modi â€œMukadma Modiâ€� and described Union ministers Sharad Yadav and George Fernandes as â€œmigratory birdsâ€� and his former ally Ranjan Prasad Yadav as a â€œshopkeeper without buyersâ€�.

â€œI call Sushil Kumar Modi â€˜Mukadma (litigation) Modiâ€™ because it is his habit to speak lies and lodge false cases,â€� he remarked while reacting to Modiâ€™s statement that a case should be instituted against Laloo and water resources minister Jagdanand Singh for misusing public money in constructing the pilot canal to bring the Ganga nearer to Patna. â€œOur effort to bring the Ganga nearer to Patna will continue.

The work has not been completed,â€� Laloo said, adding that legal action has been taken against brick manufacturers who set up their units illegally near the Ganga. He stressed that the Ganga has shifted from Patna due to these units. â€œBut â€˜Mukadma Modiâ€™ is never in favour of anything positive taking place in Bihar.

He is in the habit of making false allegations,â€� the RJD chief maintained. Saying that the joining of hands by Fernandes and Sharad was like â€œscorpions and snakesâ€� coming together during floods, Laloo once again described them as â€œmigratory birdsâ€�. â€œThe history of the migratory birds is a dangerous one. They are leaders without mass following,â€� he observed while referring to the merger of the Samata Party with the JD(U). â€œIt has hardly made any difference to the health of RJD or Congress.

We took no notice of it,â€� he said, adding that the three (Fernandes, Sharad and another Union minister Nitish Kumar) do not trust one another and are plotting against one another like foxes. â€œPeople like Devendra Prasad Yadav and Raghunath Jha have already begun to oppose the merger. So what happened to the show of unity?â€� he asked. He maintained that despite the thoroughly adverse political conditions prevailing during the last Lok Sabha polls, his candidates lost by very slim margins.

Referring to the Sampurna Vikas Dal floated by Ranjan, Laloo said political parties generally get themselves registered with the Election Commission after contesting elections. â€œBut Ranjanji has got his party registered even before contesting elections,â€� he added. Laloo said there is no shortage of political parties in Bihar. â€œThere are Pappu Yadavâ€™s party, Anwarul Haqueâ€™s party, Lok Dal and many others. There are so many shops but no buyers,â€� he remarked jokingly.

4,"Industrialist, son-in-law killed in road hold-up","LUCKNOW: A Kolkata-based industrialist and his son-in-law were shot dead and three women, including the widows of the two deceased, were held hostage in a sensational road hold-up on the outskirts of Moradabad district on Friday night.

The miscreants, numbering over half a dozen, robbed the occupants of the car and left the victims in the roadside thickets.

The incident took place around 9:30 pm as Amrit Agarwal, his wife, their son Yogesh Agarwal, daughter-in-law Ritika were on their way to Moradabad in a Cielo car (UP 14 H 3166).

Yogeshâ€™s daughter was also accompanying the family. Delhi-based Yogesh and his family members were on their way to attend the marriage of his brother Girish Agarwalâ€™s brother-in-law in Moradabad, who is a brassware exporter.

The car had barely reached the zero point entering the Moradabad border when the occupants of the car heard something fall off the vehicle. As Yogesh applied the brakes, half a dozen youths carrying country-made pistols appeared on the scene. They shot Amrit Agarwal from a point-blank range even before the car occupants could have a grasp of the situation. Thereafter, they shot Yogesh, leaving him critically injured.

The miscreants also attacked the three women, leaving them with bruises as they drove the car into the thickets. There the women were taken at gun-point while the miscreants robbed them of their belongings and fled. Subsequently, the three women somehow managed to catch the attention of a vehicle driver passing from the scene and sought police help. Senior police officials rushed to the site and extensive combing operations began following which the police managed to trace the car and body of Yogesh abandoned some 100 meters away from the scene of crime.

SSP Moradabad BB Bakshi, talking to Times News Network on phone outrightly denied that the three women who were held hostages by the miscreants were assaulted sexually as reported in a section of media. Even the family friends of the victim in Moradabad, contacted by this newspaper on phone, denied such reports and said that all the three were though in a state of shock, but had suffered minor bruises. â€œOne of the miscreants had apparently pushed one of the lady victim with the barrel of the pistol from which he had fired, this left some burn marks on the body of the women,â€� explained a family friend of the victims.

Police, quoting prime-facie and circumstantial evidences ruled out possibilities of the incident having anything more to it than a simple case of crime under the road hold-up category. â€œThere appears to no element of any old enmity here,â€� clarified the SSP.

5,"SUCI, police clash put brake on city traffic","KOLKATA: The SUCI staged two demonstrations at Esplanade and Hazra Road crossing, on Saturday, taking the police by surprise. Not unexpectedly, they threw the late afternoon traffic into chaos.

The police took a while to get their act together and then resorted to lathi-charge to remove the blockades. At least 13 SUCI supporters were arrested. SUCI leader Provas Ghosh alleged 17 demonstrators were seriously injured in the lathicharge.

Two of them were admitted to hospital. The demonstration was in protest against the chaotic health care system. Ghosh alleged that the health budget was being slashed, equipment was lying defunct and doctors and nurses had no accountability.

Ghosh wanted the state government to convene a meeting of various hospital heads, senior doctors and political parties to discuss ways to improve the health care system.

The SUCI supporters were also protesting against the decision of the state government to put curbs on holding public meetings and processions.

6,BJP-SP tie-up is likely before LS elections,"NEW DELHI: With informal talks between UP chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav''s Samajwadi Party and the BJP going on, the prospects of an electoral understanding between the two before parliamentary elections next year seem bright for the BJP leadership.

The success of such a pre-poll understanding however depends greatly on the Vajpayee government''s ability to resolve the Ayodhya issue through negotiations. A no-conflict situation between Hindus and Muslims is an essential pre-condition for a BJP-SP tie-up of any sort.

Deputy prime minister L K Advani has been holding parleys with Muslim leaders in an effort to resolve the Ayodhya tangle. Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee, Advani and law minister Arun Jaitly are among the top BJP leadership who are working towards an understanding with the SP.

Keeping this effort in mind, the BJP party line these days has also been to dissociate from the VHP and those taking a hardline stand on issues like the Ram Temple. On his part, Mulayam has decided to field 15-30 candidates for the Delhi assembly polls. The SP candidates will cut into the Congress vote-bank and hence help the BJP, which is not hopeful of doing well in Delhi.

Also, with the Rajya Sabha tenure of BJP MPs from UP getting over by the year-end or early next year, Mulayam wants the BJP to support candidates of his choice like Jaya Bachchan. For the BJP, it is difficult to get its own candidates voted into the Rajya Sabha, without help from the SP which has the largest number of MLAs in UP.

So the BJP is considering supporting Jaya Bachchan. It is evident that it was with a little help from the BJP that Mulayam finally became UP chief minister. The Vajpayee government also ensured that all cases against its erstwhile partner and Mulayam''s rival Mayawati, were pursued with grit.

10,Pak playing politics on Kashmir issue: Gilani,"NEW DELHI: Expatriate Kashmiri separatist amalgam, International Kashmir Alliance, on Sunday accused Pakistan of playing ""politics"" on India''s proposal of starting Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus service by attaching a condition that UN should be involved in it.

In a statement here, London-based IKA Chairman Sayed Nazir Gilani said, ""Pakistan, which claims to be friend of Kashmiris, has always ended up in creating more confusion"" rather than solving it.

""Pakistan has been admitting Kashmiris earlier on Indian visas...What has changed now?... Moreover, it gives more weightage to New Delhi''s statement that Islamabad was trying to politicise the confidence building measures,"" Gilani said.

""The cosmetics of an argument for the need of a UN document for travel and UN checkpoints hold no arguments. Pakistan, in its controlled part of Kashmir, does not still allow an unrestrained freedom of travel and freedom of a political activity in Gilgit and Baltistan.

Accusing Pakistani administration of adopting ""double standards"" on the issue of Kashmir, he said, ""after 13 long years Pakistan has remembered the rape victims and orphans of Kashmir... It is interesting that Pakistan''s institutional wisdom on Kashmir has decided to turn humane for the first time.""

""It may interest many Kashmiri watchers to note that Pakistan has failed on the humanitarian component of its responsibility,"" Gilani said while referring to the non-compliance of a judgement of PoK''s Supreme Court on Northern Areas.

He said the humanitarian interest of Pakistani establishment in Kashmir has always remained suspect and self-serving and added that it had ""never favoured a feel of honour and dignity to the people of Kashmir.""

Appealing to Pakistan to rethink the Kashmir specific proposals, Gilani stressed the need for allowing Kashmiris to travel between the two sides.

He appealed that senior citizens should also be allowed to cross over from Uri (Baramulla).

11,"Scam accused kills family, commits suicide","MUMBAI: Santosh Surve, 36, an accused in a financial scam, shot his wife and two daughters aged five and seven before killing himself in his flat in the wee hours of Sunday at Thane.

Surve was one of the directors of Kalpavruksha marketing firm, which has allegedly duped 300 investors of money. He had spent the entire Thursday and Friday with Naupada police giving his statements during the investigation of the scam.

Minutes after killing his wife Sanjana and daughters Ruchita and Rutuja, Surve called his driver Akash Patil and told him that he was about to commit suicide.

Patil who lives six-kilometres away from Surve''s house told TNN, ""At around 12.30 am, Saheb called on my brother cell phone. I was sleeping but I realised that it could be some urgent work, as he would normally not call at unearthly hours. He told me that he was going to kill himself. I immediately asked him where he was and replied that he was at his residence. I asked him where bhabhi was as she could prevent him from doing anything drastic. He told me in a soft voice that he had killed bhabhi and his daughters.""

Patil, rushed to the 12-floor flat of Tulip building in Sadguru Gardens where the Surves lived. Since no one answered the door, Patil approached Surve''s relatives and went to the police station.

Investigative officer of Kopri police station Ranjan Gaikwad said that they had to call the fire brigade to break open the house. ""We found the bodies of the two girls on the bed with their mother whereas Surve was lying on the marbled floor.""

12,Cong MP list: Family ties rule the roost,"BHOPAL: Itâ€™s all in the family for Congress candidates in five of the 220 declared assembly constituencies of Madhya Pradesh. Two ministers of the Digvijay Singh cabinet have been denied tickets for the December 1 elections. One ministerâ€™s son will contest in his place and another ministerâ€™s wife will be running instead of him.

Congress sources say three of the five sitting MLAs who were denied tickets are Lok Sabha hopefuls. They are more keen on sitting in Parliament than in the assembly. They suggested names of their family members when asked to suggest names for substitute candidates. This was accepted by the party high command.

The state PWD minister Shravan Kumar Patel has been denied the ticket for Bohoriband constituency in Katni district. Instead Patelâ€™s son Nishith will contest from the same seat.

The state Congress argues that Shraven Patel is being reserved to contest from the Jabalpur Lok Sabha seat for the 2004 general elections since the party has no prominent face from that seat. Meanwhile his son will run for Bohoriband.

Digvijay Singhâ€™s minister of state for forests Devendra Tekam will not contest from the scheduled caste reserved assembly seat of Mandla. His wife Krishna Tekam has been given the ticket while Devendra Tekam is a likely candidate for the Lok Sabha.

Similar being the case with former IPS officer and sitting MLA from Amarpatan constituency Shivmohan Singh who is aspiring for the candidature of the Satna Lok Sabha constituency. Shivmohan Singhâ€™s son Rajendra Singh has been given the ticket to contest from his fatherâ€™s constituency. However, this is not the first time that the Amarpatan ticket has been switched between father and son. Rajendra Singh was industries minister in the first Digvijay Singh cabinet formed in 1993. He was denied ticket in 1998 following a Lokayukt case against him. His father Shivmohan was given the ticket.

There are two cases of tickets going from brother to brother. Rajkumar Patel has been given the ticket to contest from Budhni constituency while his brother Devkumar Patel who was the Congress candidate from the same constituency in 1998 has been denied the ticket this round. In 1993, it was Rajkumar who contested from the seat.

Yet another case of interchanging tickets between two brothers. Ajay Singh, the Congress candidate from Umariya seat was denied a ticket in 1998. His brother Narendra Singh got it then. This time round, its Ajay Singh turn.

13,Former state minister Ramkrishna More dead,"PUNE: Former state education minister Ramkrishna More who took some bold decisions during his tenure including introduction of English from Std I in the state, passed away due to liver dysfunction in a Delhi hospital on Sunday.

He was 56.

More''s body was brought to Pune by an evening flight and taken to Dehu near Pune, his native place. The last rites were performed late in the evening. He is survived by a son and daughter.

Born on November 8, 1947 as the 10th descendent of noted saint poet Tukaram, More was ailing for some time and had successfully undergone a liver transplant at a Delhi hospital last month.

He had recovered fully from the surgery and came to Pune but was shifted to Delhi a few days ago due to some problems. The end came at 8 am today following a kidney failure.

More was state education minister (in charge of school education) in the Vilasrao Deshmukh ministry from October 1999 when he took some bold decisions which attracted lot of flak from many quarters.

He decided to introduce English from Std I in all schools in the state and also announced compulsory board exam for Std IV students to help assess the standard of teaching in schools - a decision cancelled by the Sushilkumar Shinde government.

While many made fun of the decision to introduce English from Std I More went ahead and successfully implemented the same with the help of specially prepared textbooks and trained staff.

He also announced a compulsory board exam for all students of Std IV in the state in place of the annual school exam to help assess the standard of teaching in primary schools in the state.

He stood firm on the decision despite severe criticism quoting a survey which revealed that as many as 56 per cent students of class IV were unable to read and write.

More felt that since the state government was spending several hundred crore rupees on primary education it has every right to assess the quality of teaching.

Another of his decision that won him laurels was the step to register mother''s name on children''s school admission certificate.

This opened the doors of schools for many a single parent children who were earlier refused admission in schools.

As the state''s minister for cultural affairs he took initiative in resolving the controversy about Chhatrapati Shivaji''s birth date and announced that govern-ment would observe the same on February 19.

More joined politics from 1971 as president of Pune district youth Congress. While completing post graduation, he used to work as a reporter in Vishal Sahyadri and also as a teacher in a secondary school in Kamshet.

Later he also worked as a professor in colleges at Saswad and Hadapsar. He later became president of the Pune Zilla Shikshan Mandal that runs 53 primary schools, 23 high schools and seven colleges among others.

More got elected to Lok Sabha from Khed constituency during 1979-89, to state legislative council in 1997 and 1998.

16,"DTC in funds mess, but private hand ruled out","NEW DELHI: Delhi transport minister Ajay Maken told The Times of India on Tuesday that the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) will not be privatised. This, despite the fact that the corporation does not have enough money to pay its employees.

Apparently, the report on the restructuring of DTC favours it continuing as a public sector entity. The report is being reviewed by the Delhi government. DTC officials, however, say the corporation has not been getting the required support from the transport department to help uplift its financial status.

A senior DTC official said: â€˜â€˜The corporation requires Rs 30 crore per month to pay its employees. But the government has been paying only an average of Rs 10 crore per month.â€™â€™

Besides, he said, the government had approved only Rs 197 crore in the revised budget estimate for 2002-2003, as against the DTCâ€™s requirement of Rs 219.51 crore. This has widened the gap between inflow and outflow of funds and also the working deficit of DTC, he said.

Referring to the financial situation of the DTC, Maken admitted: â€˜â€˜DTC has been making a loss of Rs 100 crore per year because of the bus pass scheme. But it is not possible to end the pass scheme as it is a social responsibility that the department has undertaken,â€™â€™ he said.

The transport department has been reimbursing the expenditure on passes to the DTC, but only as a loan. The money has to be paid back in instalments, which is an additional burden on the DTC, an official said. It is now being considered whether the expenditure on passes can be borne by other departments concerned.

The education department can reimburse the expenditure on passes issued to university students, the urban development department can bear the cost for passes issued to government employees, and the social department for common commuters. Maken said the report is being reviewed.

It will be implemented only after the elections. The other suggestions made in the report include changes in the hierarchy and redistribution of work. The changes would occur at the managerial level, Maken said.
