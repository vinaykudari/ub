0,Mithi govt loses confidence motion,"ITANAGAR: The minority Congress government of Mukut Mithi in Arunachal Pradesh was on Saturday night defeated on the floor of the State Assembly by a voice vote after a stormy eight-hour debate during a special session.

Mithi''s government was reduced to a minority on July 27 when 31 Congress MLAs broke ranks and joined hands with former Chief minister Gegong Apang to form the United Democratic Front alliance and stake claim to form the government.

Mithi, who had taken over power after engineering the downfall of Apang four years ago, was defeated by Congress defectors led by the former Chief Minister.

Governor V C Pande convened Saturday''s session for Mithi to prove his majority on the floor of the house after Apang paraded 42 MLAs before him on July 28.

Mithi in a desperate move to stall the special session had moved a writ petition at the Itanagar bench of the Gauhati High Court.

The petition, challenging the authority of the Speaker Tamiyo Taga to conduct the proceedings was admitted by the court and posted for hearing on Monday.

The house began on schedule at 3.00 pm with Congress MLAs loyal to Mithi questioning the propriety of Taga to preside in view of the pending writ petition filed by Health and Family Welfare minister Hari Notung on Friday.

Taga, however, told members that he had not received any communication from the High Court on a stay order or otherwise with regard to the proceedings of the house.

He told the house that whatever he was doing was legal. The Governor had summoned the special session and he had to conduct it as per the provisions of the Constitution.

Participating in the debate, the leader of the 42-member UDF, Apang said he was the lone opposition member in the house and was not craving for power.

Apang, the sole Arunachal Congress member in the house, said his friends who wanted his services for the state had made him the leader of the UDF.

Criticising the Congress for unnecessarily taking the issue to court, he said the party did it just to confuse the people.

He said during his 19 years of chief ministership, he had never been a traitor in his political career.

Apang said that while moving the confidence motion, Mithi had painted a rosy picture of his achievements and unnecessarily accused the Centre for his own failures.

Refuting accusations that he had links with the NSCN(IM), Apang said that he would renounce politics if this was ever proved.

1,Senior civic official quits in protest,"MUMBAI: Joint municipal commissioner V.L. Patankar of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has decided to quit after he was denied promotion as additional commissioner. He has still three years to go before he is due to retire.

â€œI do not want to continue,â€™â€™ he told TNN on Saturday evening. Mr Patankar is currently in charge of zone (2) in central Mumbai, which covers Parel, Matunga and Dadar. Municipal commissioner Karun Srivastava said he was unaware of Mr Patankarâ€™s decision to resign.

For the past several years, there has been a silent tussle between senior civic officials from the state services and the IAS officers posted to the BMC as additional municipal commissioners.

Deputy commissioners and joint commissioners like Mr Patankar come through the civic ranks and continue to work in the BMC until they retire. On the other hand, additional commissioners enjoy a maximum tenure of three years.

â€œThe BMC house has passed three resolutions, the last in 1997, which stated that 50 per cent of the post of additional commissioners be filled up by promoting deputy commissioners,â€™â€™ Mr Patankar said.

He is piqued because joint commissioner R.A. Rajeev, who is an IAS officer, has been promoted as additional commissioner from August 1. There are four additional commissioners in the BMC.

Other civic officials said they were upset that the government chose to give preferential treatment to outsiders instead of letting senior BMC officials rise.

Mr Patankar said he had made his proposal several times, but Mr Srivastava had failed to forward it to Mantralaya.

However, the civic chief denied the allegation, adding that he had sent Mr Patankarâ€™s request to the state general administration department.

2,Sena bandh gets Muslim support,"MUMBAI: Wednesdayâ€™s Mumbai bandh will go down in history as the first Shiv Sena-called bandh which was supported by Muslims. In fact, minority-dominated localities such as Bhendi Bazar saw joint rallies by the Muslims and Sena to condemn the recent series of bomb blasts in the city, which have been blamed on Pakistani-inspired terrorists.

Bhendi Bazar incidentally went berserk on March 1, celebrating Indiaâ€™s victory over Pakistan at the World Cup. It was this very same enclave dubbed mini-Pakistan by the saffron brigade that organised a morcha condemning Pakistan at the height of the Kargil conflict.

Several Muslims see this as a welcome trend which is indicative of the loosening grip of the hardliners over the Muslim masses.

â€˜â€˜The community is making a conscious effort to combat the myth propagated by the RSS and the Sena that its loyalties lie with Pakistan,â€™â€™ says Bohri reformist leader Asghar Ali Engineer, who runs the Centre for Study of Society and Secularism.

Retired high court judge S.M. Daud sees in these gestures the willingness of the Muslim community to join the secular mainstream or at least convince the Hindus who are increasingly being swayed by the communal propaganda of the saffron parties. â€˜â€˜Voices which had been drowned out till now are finally being heard,â€™â€™ he says.

Others such as Feroze Mithiborwala of the Muslim Youth for India say that such gestures are indicative of the desire the younger generation of Muslims to find a way of their social and political ghettoisation.

â€˜â€˜Young Muslims realise that they need to connect with the rest of the country. As a first step, they need to dispel any doubts or misconceptions people have about them,â€™â€™ he says.

Maulana Musanna Miyan, a respected community elder, says Muslims called for a bandh independently on Wednesday as â€˜â€˜it was the call of the dayâ€™â€™. Doing so, he says, will promote better understanding between Hindus and Muslims.

However, quite a few of those spoken to by this newspaper feel that such gestures are suggestive of a fear psychosis after Gujarat. They feel that these gestures are driven by the instinct for self-preservation.

â€˜â€˜Muslims are afraid that their silence can send a wrong signal to the majority community,â€™â€™ says criminal lawyer Majeed Memon. â€˜â€˜Hence, they are emphatically asserting that they are pro-India.â€™â€™

Hasina Khan of Awaaz-e-Niswan, a progressive Muslim womenâ€™s organisation, also feels that such gestures are indicative of a sense of insecurity in the Muslim mind.

â€˜â€˜Globally, Muslims are under attack for allegedly aiding terrorism. It is so easy to label any Muslim sect as a sympathiser of terrorists as happened with the Ahle Hadees recently,â€™â€™ she says.

Others such as K.M. Aarif of the United Economic Forum says: â€˜â€˜If this is the way the majority community can be assured of our patriotism, it is a small sacrifice.â€™â€™

3,Doctors' rally hits Patiala hospitals,"PATIALA: All hospital and teaching services, except medical emergency, remained paralysed for two hours on Saturday in Rajindra Hospital, Govt Medical College and Dental College & Hospital, Patiala.

A massive joint rally was organised by medical and dental teachers and PCMS doctors. The rally was addressed by representatives of Medical and Dental Teacherâ€™s A s s o c i a t i o n , PCMS Association, Junior Doctorsâ€™ Association and Medical Studentsâ€™ Association. It was decided to intensify the ongoing agitation at the rally for revival of NPA keeping in view the adamant antidoctor and anti-public stand of the government.

The doctors outrightly rejected the proposal of the Punjab government to allow private practice by government doctors. This move would cause a great setback to the anti-corruption drive by the state government by legalising private practices, which has been done at the instance of a powerful lobby of state bureaucracy and politicians, they alleged.

Privatisation of health services is a westernised concept which could not be applied in this country where a large section of the society was under-privileged, living below the poverty line and dependent on health services provided in government-run institutions at affordable rates, the doctors said.

The doctors also demanded immediate dismissal of K.R. Lakhanpal, finance secretary, Punjab for misleading state government with â€˜â€˜manufacturedâ€™â€™ data. Dr D.S. Bhullar, president, Dr Y.S. Banga, general secretary, Dr Jasvinder Singh (vice-president), Dr Vijay (press secretary) of PCMS Association, Patiala, addressed the meeting.

Dr B.S. Sohal, general secretary, Medical and Dental Teachers Association, Dr K.S. Kang (dental faculty), Dr Rajan, president and Dr Balkishan, vice-president, Junior Doctor Association, condemned the arrogant and rigid attitude of Punjab government.

4,"BJP to use Ayodhya agenda during elections, says ML","PATNA: CPI (ML) general secretary Dipankar Bhattacharya on Saturday said that Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had dropped all his earlier pretensions of distancing himself from the ''sangh parivar''s'' Ayodhya agenda.

He said this in reaction to Vajpayee''s assurance to overcome all obstacles coming in the way of fulfilling last wishes of chairman of Ramajanma Bhumi Nyasa Ramchandra Paramhans.

Bhattacharya said that Vajpayee''s arrival at Ayodhya and the way he joined the chorus sung by Union home minister L K Advani, RSS chief K S Sudarshan and VHP chief Ashok Singhal marked a new readiness on the part of the BJP to fight the next elections on the Ayodhya issue.

The myth that there was an independent NDA agenda had now been finally cremated on the banks of Saryu, Bhattacharya said, adding that a return to the Ayodhya issue signified only the growing weakness and desperation of the BJP. For an overwhelming majority of the country, the BJP government had proved to be nothing but a ""harbinger of an all-round economic crisis, unprecedented violation of democratic norms and shameless subservience to Anglo-American imperialist axis"".

He said that the left and democratic forces must frustrate the BJP''s efforts to use Ayodhya as an ""emotional veil over this sordid reality"".

6,Laloo's prescription: Keep off politics,"PATNA: The Rashtriya Janata Dal supremo Laloo Prasad Yadav requested the doctors to act sensibly and stay away from politics before taking any serious decision such as strike.

Yadav was speaking at the inaugural function of the diagonistic centre at the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS) here on Saturday which was inaugurated by the chief minister Rabri Devi.

He said that the work in emergency wards of the hospital should not be disturbed under any condition as it happened during a recent strike in one of the hospitals in the city.

Yadav said that the doctors should always maintain the sanctity of their profession and not get influenced by other peoplesâ€™ view regarding their action. They should remember that even a dayâ€™s strike in hospitals result in several deaths, which could otherwise be easily prevented, he added.

The former chief minister said that the doctors should keep in mind that their each and every action has an impact on the life of people. They should remember that the patients who suffer the most have not done any wrong, he said, and added that therefore they should not be victimised.

Reacting to the recent incidents of kidnapping and murders in the state, he said that the state government has already taken some steps to punish the criminals involved in such acts. â€œKidnapping, extortion and murder also take place in other parts of the country but when it happens in Bihar the situation is portrayed in such a way that the image of the state is tarnished,â€� he said.

Yadav said that the tourist and dignitaries visiting the state have never complained about the law and order condition which goes on to prove that the situation is not so bad as is painted.

The chief minister said that the state government has already provided 100 acre of land at Khagaul for the branch of AIIMS to be established here.

The RJD chief said that funds would be provided from the chief minister discretionary funds for distribution of free life saving drugs to poor and helpless patients of IGIMS. He also announced the donation of Rs 20 lakh from his MP fund for plantation of trees in the hospital campus.

7,‘Dual citizenship Bill to become law soon’,"PUNE: Deputy prime minister L.K. Advani on Saturday said the dual citizenship Bill will become a law by the end of the year. He was replying to a student, who had asked him whether the proposed dual citizenship plan of the NDA government would help prevent brain drain, during an interactive session at the Symbiosis society.

The Bill, allowing Indian citizenship to people of Indian origin residing in the UK, US, Canada, Australia, Finland, Ireland, Italy and the Netherlands, was introduced in the Rajya Sabha in May this year. The government is taking all steps ensure that the Bill gets converted into a law before the end of this year, the Union home minister said, allaying fears about brain drain.

To a suggestion by a Kenyan student pursuing higher studies at a Symbiosis institute, Advani said he would personally look into the matter of introducing a general educational visa for foreign students. When another student pointed out that those coming from abroad have to pay five times the normal fee, Advani said he had taken note of the complaint.

Later in the day, the deputy prime minister inaugurated the Rs 9-crore Kirplani & Kundnani eye institute at the Sadhu Vaswani Mission.

Speaking on the occasion, he said health care and education were the two critical sectors India needed to concentrate on if it is to achieve its goal of becoming a global superpower.

Referring to his Symbiosis experience, Advani said the need of the hour was not just increasing the intelligence quotient, but also the moral, emotional and spiritual quotients.

8,Advani snubs finance minister Adsul,"PUNE: Union minister of state for finance Anand Adsulâ€™s strategy to extract commitment from deputy prime minister L.K. Advani on the co-operative sectorâ€™s demands by raising them on a public platform backfired on Saturday.

Adsul, who used the inaugural function of Pune Cooperative Bank Ltd to air his views regarding the reforms he wants to bring about in the sector, received a royal snub from Advani, who strongly reprimanded him for raising the issues in public.

â€œYou should raise these issues in cabinet meetings and not in public,â€� Advani said. Adsul told the gathering that the joint parliamentary committee (JPC) would soon take up the issue of forming an additional post of deputy director of Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for monitoring the functioning of co-operative banks.

He said he was pressing for the formation of the fourth deputy directorâ€™s post in RBI as it would help end the dual governance of cooperative banks by the co-operative department and RBI.

Lamenting the recent rejection by the apex bank of his proposal to this effect, Adsul said, â€œI have brought the issue to the JPCâ€™s notice and it has promised to take it up with the bank.â€�

â€œAt least, the audit of cooperative banks should be directly controlled by RBIappointed auditors,â€� he said.

Adsul justified his demand pointing out that several co-operative banks, which had been graded â€œthe bestâ€� by their auditors, were found guilty in a recent cooperative bank scam in Maharashtra and Gujarat.

He criticised the RBI policy of rejecting applications for starting new co-operative banks, pointing out that member of Parliament (BJP) Anna Joshi, who is founder of the Pune co-operative bank, was among the six fortunate applicants, of 221, who had got RBI nod for starting new co-operative banks.

â€œI fail to understand why 90 per cent of applications get rejected when they are forwarded through regional RBI officials,â€� Adsul said, and sought that Advani look into the demand for lowering interest rates of agricultural loans.

This pressure tactic, however, did not go down well with Advani, who asked Adsul to raise the issues before the Union cabinet.

The deputy prime minister, however, admitted the need to strengthen the co-operative movement, and said that he had asked the Union finance ministry to ensure that the co-operative sectorâ€™s progress is not hampered because of its polices.

He appealed to people to contribute towards the progress of the nation, instead of expecting the government to do all the work.

Advani pointed out that in the pre-1947 era, the country had a â€œcommon goalâ€� to free itself from the British.

Lamenting that no such common goal existed today, he said, â€œIndia should become a developed nation by the year 2020. The 21st century should be ours. This should be our common goal.â€�

Earlier, Anna Joshi urged Advani to direct RBI to wave its rider restraining the directors of co-operative banks from issuing loans to their relatives.

12,Mallya unveils party's agriculture policy,"HUBLI: Janata Party working President Vijay Mallya, who is on a campaign string in North Karnataka, has formulated his party''s agriculture policy that aims to help farmers in distress and promote agriculture exports.

Disclosing this at a meet-the-press programme in Hubli on Saturday, Mallya said the central theme of the policy is to create a sustainable future for agriculture in Karnataka.

""This is a policy which is about sustainable agriculture, a policy which says there is a bright and strong future for agriculture in the state, a policy which says we can do even better on export, on growing the market for agriculture products.""

""We make sure that not only do we have the inputs into farming that are viable, but also the outputs and how we sell to open up those markets,"" he said at a crowded conference.

Mallya said that never before in the history of independent India have peasants and agricultural labourers faced so serious a threat to their lives and livelihood. In fact, the green revolution formulated by our forefathers has derived one-per cent result.

""Our new policy envisages to improve the mechanisation and commercialisation in agriculture enabling the farmers to make profit not only on what they sell but also on what the country exports,"" Mallya asserted.

Mallaya also announced that his party would soon have an alliance with Nationalist Congress Party of Sharad Pawar as the talks between him and Pawar have turned positive.

Claiming that the country was witnessing a Janata Party wave, Mallya said a large number of farmers and youths were coming forward to join the party. ""The need of the hour is to give a chance to youths. Only they can bring about radical changes in the present system.""

Youth has been identified as the prime focus of the party with young blood, fresh ideas, commitment and accountability as the major criteria to select its cadres, he said.

He said he would soon launch party''s youth cadre wings under two different age groups.

He said he enjoyed the support of Janata Parivar leader Ramakrishna Hegde in all his endeavour. ""I consider Hegde as my close relative and have developed close relations with him after my father''s death. If this human relationship is mistaken in political parlance, what can I do about that,"" he questioned.

Earlier, Mallya took out huge rally in the main thoroughfares of city followed by a party meeting. He also visited the well-known Ayyappa Swamy Temple in the city.

13,Sales rep body to protest sale of spurious drugs,"CHANDIGARH: The Federation of Medical and Sales Representatives Association of India (FMRAI) would be staging a demonstration before the Union health ministry in November to protest governmental inaction in checking black marketing of medicines and sale of spurious drugs.

Addressing media persons here on Sunday, FMRAI general secretary D P Dubey said that in the run-up to the November programme, medical representatives would stage demonstrations, distribute leaflets and hold street corner meetings in 300 cities and towns across the country on September 24 to bring to light the rampant sale of spurious drugs.

Further, demonstrations would be staged in front of the office of the health ministers of the respective states in October ""for the benefit of the people"".

""In India, 40 per cent of the pharmaceutical market is in the grip of black marketing of medicines and spurious drugs. The government has failed to book the offenders under the Drugs and Cosmetic Act, 1940,"" Dubey said.

He further said, ""though Union Health Minister Sushma Swaraj announced during a CII meet that makers of spurious drugs should be given death penalty, the law ministry said after a few days that death penalty cannot be awarded since it is very difficult to prove that an eventuality has occurred because of fake drugs. This clearly shows that the Centre is surrendering to the pressure of the pharmaceutical lobby led by multinational companies.""

Coming down heavily on the ""lack of interest"" shown by the government for carrying out research on developing new drugs, Dubey said that even as 1.5 crore people were suffering from TB nationwide and the number of drug resistant cases were going up, no new drug for TB had been developed in the last 33 years.

He further said that as compared to 92 basic drugs manufactured in India in 1988, only 60 were manufactured now.

""Even as malaria, filarial, TB drugs are required in India, the market is now being needlessly flooded with American drugs for treating erectile dysfunction, anti-obesity pills and Viagra, which are not the need of the hour. This when the American Food and Drug Administration has concluded after a 10-year study that 85 per cent of the new drugs being introduced are in no way better than the existing drugs,"" he added.

Dubey also alleged that the government was destroying India''s ""self sufficiency"" in drug industry and five public sector drug companies had closed down. A a result, more than five lakh workers have been rendered jobless.

He said the BJP-led government had failed to implement the NDA agenda set out by all parties.

``The BJP and VHP are sending a clear message to the NDA allies. Nobody can stop the political developments that will take place in the coming days,"" he added.

15,"CPM, Congress for early LS polls","KOLKATA : Neither Congress nor CPM leaders in Kolkata are averse to the idea of holding assembly polls in five states and the Lok Sabha elections together, though they suspect a BJP gameplan behind it.

Congress chief whip in Lok Sabha Priyaranjan Dasmunshi said on Sunday holding the polls together would be acceptable if they were held under the existing governments in four Congress ruled states.

â€œThe BJP leadership may like to hold the polls in Congress-ruled states under Presidentâ€™ rule by postponing it for two months. But we can not accept that,â€™â€™ said Dasmunshi. The Congress will give their final opinion after pondering over the pros and cons in a high level meeting in Delhi on Monday, he added.

CPM politburo member Anil Biswas said that his party was â€œready to face the pollsâ€� whenever it would be declared. â€œ It is a BJP move to divert the Opposition attention to unity efforts and to prepare a groundwork for electoral battle. Even NDA partners have not approved it so far. If Advani is so serious about his proposal, the Centre should talk to major political parties before taking any decision,â€™â€™ said Biswas.

While he was not averse to holding polls in five states which were due in November and the general election, he argued against declaring assembly elections in all states at one go. â€œ This is not realistic,â€™ he observed.

Though the CPM leadership is working overtime to be a match-maker between Congress and Samajwadi party and other Opposition parties at the Centre, the state Congress and CPM are in a collision course on issues concerning the state.

The PCC will organise a â€˜blockade of Writers Buildingâ€™ on September 11 to protest against the recent increases in state taxes including land tax, cess and new panchayat act, declared the PCC general secretary Manas Bhuian. He reminded that the last such blockade was called by the PCC way back in 1989.

Biswas described it as an effort to mimic Trinamul Congress. â€œWe will tell the people not to join the Congress-sponsored agitation since it would not help the development of the state,â€™â€™ he said.

Briefing on the CPM state committeeâ€™s extended meeting on party activities in trade unions, a tongue-in-cheek Biswas parried questions over the conflict between the workers agitation and the Left Front governmentâ€™s efforts to build an investor-friendly image.

â€œOur party central committee had kept in mind the existence of our government in the state while preparing the document. We do ask workers to take care for production and productivity everywhere. But the documents dealt not on industrial relations or industrialisation in the state. It was more concerned with partyâ€™s political activities among workers,â€™â€™ argued Biswas

The accused are Balappa alias Bamia, Lingare, Sunil Kakade, Suresh Pujari and Praveen Thorad.

Balu Dokre, who now controls the gang''s activities in Mumbai, is the prime accused in the case.

Dokre had allegedly used his influence in Arthur Road jail to get 13 Rajan gangsters transferred to Nashik jail in November last year. He is wanted in several extortion cases and the police has launched a hunt for him.

These gangsters were reportedly kept in a cell next to O P Singh''s. On November 24, when O P Singh was going for his bath, the Rajan aides reportedly accosted him and strangulated him.

The jail authorities had then claimed that this was suicide. But, O P Singh''s relative had suspected foul play and requested the state CID to look into the matter.

The post mortem report revealed it was a murder. The jail authorities were suspended later.

19,Youths arrested for having fake driving licence,"CHANDIGARH: The Chandigarh Traffic Police decision to revoke the driving licence of habitual violators has thrown up an interesting case, which led to the arrest of two youths on Sunday.

The traffic police had recently, under its new scheme, sent the driving licence of a Sector 15 resident Manish Pandit, for cancellation to the licensing authority, Sonepat, as he was found to be involved in some 10 traffic violations considered dangerous to human life. He had been challaned for jumping red lights, driving without helmet and overspeeding.

The licensing authority, Sonepat, which had issued the licence instead found that it was a fake. The number on which it was issued to Manish Pandit, in fact, belonged to someone else. The Sonepat authority sent the case back to the Chandigarh traffic police with a certificate that the licence was fake.

The superintendent of police (traffic) then complained to local police for registration of a case.

A case of cheating, forgery and criminal conspiracy was registered against Manish Pandit under Section 420, 467, 468, 474 and 120-B, IPC, at the sector 11 police station on Sunday and Manish was arrested. He told police that he had bought the licence from one Naveen Tomar, a resident of Sector 12 for Rs 500 and did not know about the authenticity of the licence. Tomar was also arrested.

Sources said that Tomar, who now works in call centre, has been in the past arrested in a similar case of fake licences.

Both the accused will be produced in the district courts on Monday. Both the accused are said to be in their twenties.

The Chandigarh Traffic Police has sent some six odd cases to various licensing authorities for cancellation of licences. This system is already working in many metro cities where checking traffic violations had become a big problem and only punitive actions as this were considered a better option.

Among the punishments recommended could be suspension of a driving licence for a one month period to six months. The violator is also given chance to appeal after which the driving licence is suspended.

Among the main violations which are considered dangerous to human life are overspeeding, drunken driving, jumping red lights or not stopping on being signalled by a policeman.

21,BJP to stage dharna demanding Shahabuddin's arrest,"PATNA: The BJP workers would hold dharnas and demonstrations at all the district headquarters of the state on August 5 to demand immediate arrest of Siwan RJD MP Mohammad Shahabuddin, handing over the inquiry of Gopalganj rural bank dacoity to the CBI and retrial of all the cases in which he was acquitted for want of evidence outside Bihar.

Memorandum to this effect would be handed over to the concerned district magistrates, according to a press statement issued by party''s state vice-president Kiran Ghai. It would also demand inquiry into the assets of Shahabuddin and his relations with the international crime world.

The BJP also demanded an inquiry into the linkage of ministers and MLAs, who had stood for Shahabuddin besides demanding that their activities should be watched. The manner, in which RJD MLAs stood in support of Shahabuddin, goes to show that he has been getting their support and patronage somehow or the other, Ghai said.

State Yuva Samata president Bhagwan Singh Kushwaha demanded that DGP DP Ojha, who had recommended for a CBI probe into the alleged involvement of Sahabuddin in the Gopalganj bank dacoity committed on March 24, should resign on moral ground, as he is escaping from his responsibility by not arresting the MP despite sufficient evidences against him. He held the state government and the police responsible for encouraging crime in the state.

A day-long dharna was organised here on Sunday under the auspices of Muslim Conference Of India, which opposed the DGP''s move. Conference leader Md Imamul Haque said that agitations from Muslim organisations would continue till he is suspended from his post.

Haque said that the DGP is playing in the hands of communal forces at the Centre. He also demanded suspension of Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani and Union HRD minister Murli Manohar Joshi from the Cabinet.

Loktantrik Samata Party''s state president P K Sinha and general secretary Kumar Vijay have expressed their surprise over the role of some ministers and ruling RJD leaders on Sahabuddin issue and termed it as interference in judicial process.

A march was organised here on Sunday from under the auspices of Bihar State Student''s Union from Ayakar roundabout to Dak Bunglow chowk in protest against rise in crime-graph in the state and demanding dismissal of the police administration.

22,Customs official arrested for graft,"KOLKATA: Barely 10 days after making headlines for arresting a fish merchant from Diamond Harbour with 460 gms of brown sugar on July 23, the Customs Barasat division is in the news once again, but for all the wrong reasons. A senior officer of the division was arrested on Sunday by the anti-corruption wing of the Central Bureau of Investigation, for demanding a bribe from the brother-in-law of the arrested fish merchant.

On July 23, Customs (preventive wing) officials from the Barasat division, acting on a tip-off, raided a shop in a wholesale fish market of Diamond Harbour and arrested Sukumar Roy with the drugs. He was booked under the Narcotics, Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act.

A few days later, Royâ€™s brother-in-law contacted the CBI and complained that S K Das, superintendent of the Customs (Barasat division) had contacted him and demanded Rs 12 lakh to provide â€˜helpâ€™ to the accused fish merchant.

The anti-corruption wing of the CBI laid a trap for Das. Accordingly, Royâ€™s brother-in-law invited Das to the Ballygunge AC Market at 10.30 am on Sunday to â€˜hand overâ€™ the first instalment of Rs 3 lakh. CBI sleuths, lying in wait, nabbed Das red-handed as he was accepting the bag with the â€˜markedâ€™ currency.

â€œDas has been charged with corruption. We have begun investigations and are carrying out raids at Dasâ€™ residence. During our search, we have seized cash, documents pertaining to investments and bank books. Search operations are still in progress. We think that a few others may also be involved in the racket,â€� a CBI official said.

Till the evening, senior Customs officials were unaware of the details regarding Dasâ€™ arrests. â€œWe are trying to find out more details. We can say something on Monday,â€� they said.
