3,No excuses now for Delhi govt,"NEW DELHI: Control over Delhi Development Authority (DDA) will undergo a change of hands, if Parliament passes the statehood bill in this session. The Union cabinet on Monday decided to part with the control over land, but keep law and order in its control.

""The state government will now exercise control over the land in the city. They will decide the course of development in the city,"" a senior DDA official said.

As of now it''s the Union government which decides on development, be it housing or development of commercial and institutional areas in the city.

This will have direct impact on the real-estate. ""The state government''s decisions will then decide property prices,"" he said.

The land-use pattern of the city will also be decided by the state government. ""Delhi government interacts with the city''s residents on a more regular basis. It will be able to implement its vision of the city''s development in a more systematic manner and allow proper land use,"" another official said.

Therefore, the Master Plan for Delhi will be systematically worked out by the state government. ""Delhi government will then chalk-out the plan, after examining the needs of the city,"" he said.

With DDA under its belt, Delhi government will also be responsible to protect land. ""It will have the mandate to stop encroachments of government-owned land and growth of unauthorised colonies and slums,"" he said.

Will DDA become a better-managed system, DDA officials are unsure.

""Is Municipal Corporation of Delhi a better-managed place? Is it less corrupt?"" questioned one of the directors in DDA.

DDA vice chairman Anil Baijal, however, refused to comment. ""I am not yet aware of the blueprint of the bill. So would not like to comment on this,"" he said.

4,Farmers' rally flops in Gandhinagar,"GANDHINAGAR: The Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS) rally in the state Capital on Monday against the 2.5 times tariff hike for unmetered electricity for farmers was a major flop.

As against the prerally claim that nearly 5,000 farmers might take part, merely 450, brought on 50-odd vehicles, made up the rally sponsored by the Sangh Parivar farmers'' wing. ""They put up the show so that they aren''t left behind, when the Congress is so active against the hike,"" said a participant.

Addressing the rally, BKS state general secretary Maganlal Patel announced that a Maha-Kumbh'' of state kisans would be held here on August 25 wherein nearly 10 lakh farmers would take a pledge to fight against the hike.

Even as the rally was on, the farmers were losing interest in it and some walked out, with several of them saying that those addressing them had ''betrayed the farmers'' cause''.

Started an hour after it was scheduled, at 2 pm, the senior BKS leader explained the poor attendance saying most farmers were ''still not angry with the hike''.

The farmers'' ire would show up once the deadline for paying the bills with hiked tariff ends -- August 20. ""Thereafter, the connection would be cut. And there are bound to be scuffles. We plan to catch on that.""

Patel said, he knew that the government was under pressure, but till the farmers showed ''enough strength'' it would not relent. ""Between August 16 and 25 we will go to each MLA and MP to get a written assurance that they stood with us against the hike,"" the farmer leader said.

5,LU increases its seats by 10 per cent,"LUCKNOW: Lucknow University authorities have approved the proposal for a 10 per cent increase in the number of seats in the undergraduate and post-graduate courses it offers.

The decision was taken at a meeting of the deans of all faculties, that was called on Monday, to consider the state governmentâ€™s recommendation of a 25 per cent increase in the number of seats. This will effect an increase of around 275 seats in the undergraduate courses.

It was decided that henceforth, degree certificates would be issued to students in both English and Hindi and the improvement and back-paper examinations will be held from September 10 to 20, 2003.

University officials felt that the existing faculty strength and infrastructure at LU are not sufficient for a 25 per cent hike in the number of seats. The decision would result in an increase of around 1,700 seats in BA, around 45 seats in BCom, around 45 seats in BSc (Maths) and 25-odd seats in BSc (Bio).

The merit list for admissions in the â€˜increasedâ€™ list would be declared by further extending the waiting list declared earlier. All these â€˜newâ€™ seats will fall under the self-financed category. Candidates will not get the subjects of their preference, but will have to chose from the subject combinations available and offered by the university. With regard to the post-graduate courses, an assessment would be made regarding the availability of seats in particular courses, as in many PG courses, a 10 per cent hike in the number of seats has been effected. Fresh dates of counselling for the newly created seats will be announced soon.

7,Police zero in on stepmother in kidnapping case,"PATNA: The police have almost zeroed in on the involvement of Shwetangi''s stepmother, Seema Kumari, in the former''s kidnapping case. The letters shown to the police by Babloo, the cousin of Seema, and telephone printouts have led the police to believe that Seema was in touch with Babloo before the kidnapping of Shwetangi.

Seven-year-old Shwetangi was kidnapped from outside her house at Patel Nagar when she was leaving for school along with her father, Santosh Kumar, on Friday. On Saturday afternoon Santosh gave a statement that he had total faith in his wife. However, the same day the police arrested Seema''s father, Chandreshwar Prasad Verma and brother, Rinku.

The police are thinking of arresting Seema on the basis of strong evidence, said a senior police official. Santosh might not have guessed such a plan of his in-laws and the possible involvement of his own wife in the kidnapping of Shwetangi, sources said. The two kidnappers â€” the driver who drove the car in which Shwetangi was taken to West Singhbhum and the woman who kept Shwetangi at her house â€” would be brought to Patna soon for interrogation, according to the police. So far 17 arrests have been made in the Shwetangi case.

Out of the 13 arrested in Patna, Babloo was arrested at Anandpuri, four from Yuvraj Hotel in Patna while the rest were arrested from the CDA Colony, Raja Bazar and other places. The four criminals arrested in Patna, including Shakeel, are wanted in cases of murder and dacoity in Bhagalpur.

Seema''s father and brother were arrested in Darbhanga in 1995 in the case of kidnapping of Surabhi, a student of Prabhat Tara School, Muzaffarpur. She was recovered from the Darbhanga residence of Verma. Babloo was also involved in Surabhiâ€™s abduction and had been evading arrest for eight years.

8,"Eye on polls, Sena looks to Ganpati","MUMBAI: The Shiv Sena is all set to showcase Lord Ganesha as the leitmotif of ''Mee Mumbaikar,'' the party''s ongoing crusade to reinforce the city''s composite culture, as defined by it.

The Sena''s plan is to invoke the elephant God''s eclectic appeal in a bid to cut a swathe across Mumbai''s ethnic and linguistic communities. ""Lord Ganesha represents the spirit of Mumbai and Mumbaikars. The metropolis nurses a special affection for the deity,"" Sena''s executive chief Uddhav Thackeray told TNN recently. The high-profile annual Ganpati festival is scheduled to start on August 31.

Uddhav has instructed the Sena''s shakhas across the city to weave the fest-theme around ''Mee Mumbaikar,'' a concept he floated this March, with Lord Ganesha as the campaign''s presiding deity.

""The Ganpati festival began in the 19th century as a melting pot of ideas and ideologies which shaped modern Maharashtra. For Lokmanya Tilak, who started it all, the Ganesha festival was a vehicle for social reform and religious resurgence. The Sena wants the festival to be invested with the same spirit to social causes, with an added accent on Mumbai,"" Uddhav said.

""Sadly, consumerism has crept into the Ganpati festival. We want civic issues to be highlighted during the festival,"" he added.

11,Pak minorities urge end to 'discriminatory' laws,"ISLAMABAD: The All Pakistan Minorities Alliance (APMA) has asked the government to abolish all ""discriminatory articles, sections and statues"" in the constitution to ensure equal rights to religious minorities.

Speaking to reporters here on Monday, APMA chairman Shahbaz Bhatti said these ""discriminatory and draconian"" laws were increasing the sense of insecurity and fear among the religious minorities and damaging the image of Pakistan.

""These laws are contradictory to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and negate the founding principles of Pakistan,"" he said and added that the blasphemy law was misused against non-Muslim citizens.

Bhatti asked the government to form a judicial commission to review the cases of blasphemy law because many prisoners had been waiting for trial under this law for years and were facing extremely hostile situation in jails.

The APMA chief also demanded that the government recognise the role of minorities in the creation of Pakistan and include it in textbooks.

He said APMA would make a documentary film to highlight the contribution of minorities in Pakistan''s creation.

16,Rains give boost to farm prospects,"GANDHINAGAR: With heavy rains continuing in some parts of South Gujarat on Tuesday, the stateâ€™s average rainfall has so far reached 801 mm, as against the average seasonal rainfall of 852 mm recorded during the monsoon in last 10 years.

Kutch districtâ€™s total rainfall received so far is 655 mm, almost double than the seasonal average of 345 mm. In Saurashtra, Rajkot district has so far received 633 mm of rainfall, as against the average of 498 mm.

Junagadh district has so far received over 633 mm of rainfall as against the average of 498 mm. The total rainfall of Jamnagar district has reached 758 mm as against its average of 480 mm.

In South Gujarat, Navsari district has received highest rainfall of 1,978 mm in this season so far as against the average of 1,631 mm while Bharuch district has crossed 575 mm of rainfall as against the average of 640 mm. In Surat, the total rainfall reported so far is 1,393 mm against its average of 1,207 mm.

This time Dangs district is lagging behind as so far it has received 1,391 mm of rainfall against the average of 2,788 mm. Meanwhile, widespread rains all over Gujarat this season has ensured sowing operations in 81.41 lakh hectares of land till August first week, which is 15.7 per cent higher than 70.34 lakh hectare around the same time last year. It has also already crossed last five yearâ€™s average of 81.41 lakh hectare and is likely to go up further this season to 84 lakh hectare, as sowing is still on for cotton, castor, tur and paddy.

According to agriculture minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasma, the widespread rainfall is likely to increase the agricultural crop yield in the state by Rs 5,000 crore and horticulture (including fruits and vegetables) by Rs 6,000 crore, as compared to the last year.

State director of agriculture, Dr A K Dikshit said, â€œthe first spell of rainfall and its evenly distributed pattern spread over six weeks was just the right kind for kharif crops in the state, mostly grown in rainfed condition.â€� â€œIt will require two more spells of rain before mid-September for a good kharif crops. But, a bumper rabi crop, including wheat, gram and mustard, is a certainty,â€� he said.

Out of a total 225 talukas in Gujarat, as many as 60 talukas have already received more than the entire monsoon seasonâ€™s rainfall by August first week itself. Incidentally, these include the usually drought-prone Saurashtra, Kutch and North Gujarat regions.

It is in these regions only where the stateâ€™s major cash crops like oilseeds and cotton are grown. While the farmers this time have indeed gone for growing more til and groundnut, they do not seem to be much interested in castor. The area under groundnut cultivation in the state, which contributes about one-fourth of the countryâ€™s total production, is estimated to have gone up to 19.56 lakh hectare, an increase of seven per cent over the last year.

Cotton has so far been sown in 16.09 lakh hectare this season, as compared to the last five yearâ€™s average of 16.42 lakh hectare. Because of delayed monsoon, it was sown in only 13.95 lakh hectare till this time of the last year.

18,IMA protests capitation fees for MBBS,"KOLKATA: Members of the Indian Medical Association (headquarters) protested against harassment in the hands of authorities and patientsâ€™ family members for alleged negligence in Kolkata on Monday.

In a fourhour-long demonstration, the doctors also claimed that the West Bengal government had contravened the Constitution by allowing â€˜capitationâ€™ candidates admission to medical colleges.

â€œThe West Bengal government has set a bad precedent by allowing admission to capitation candidates in state-run medical col-leges.

This will go against the interests of meritorious students and is anti-constitutional.

The state has also failed to ensure the safety of doctors in spite of assurances by chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee,â€� said IMA secretary general Dr Sanjiv Malik.

Malik did not deny that there were cases of medical negligence. â€œThis, however, does not mean that doctors can be beaten up and dragged to the police station in handcuffs. There have been many such cases in West Bengal in the last couple of years. The chief minister had assured us that no action would be taken till a prima facie case was prepared against the accused.

However, he went back on his word. The morale of the doctors is going down and they are suspecting every patient to be a potential litigant,â€� Malik said.

The IMA plans to start a country-wide movement. â€œThere is a strict Supreme Court guideline for private medical institutions. The same canâ€™t hold true for state-run colleges,â€� said Malik.

19,"Farm, investment key issue at WTO","NEW DELHI: A national consensus seems to be building up on key issues of concern for India at the WTO meeting of trade ministers in Cancun to be held from September 10 to 14.

The Congress on Monday agreed with the the government that the WTO negotiations for liberalisation of the world trade in agriculture and the attempt of some of the developed countries to start negotiations on a global investment agreement are two special areas of India''s concern at the forthcoming conference.

As part of his efforts to evolve a national consensus on WTO issues, commerce and industry minister Arun Jaitly met Congress leaders Pranab Mukherjee and Manmohan Singh here and discussed the ongoing WTO negotiations.

He sought their views and support to evolve a strategy for WTO talks so that India''s interests in key area of agriculture, industrial tariff and the so-called Singapore issues are safeguarded.

The four Singapore issues are proposals made by some of the developed countries, notably the European Union, to negotiate global agreements under the WTO covering areas such as foreign investment, competition policy, trade facilitation and government procurement.

India is opposed to expanding the WTO agenda to include such negotiations. It is of the opinion that particularly in an area such as foreign investment, national governments must retain the policy space to decide on entry of foreign capital.

Though the Congress leaders agreed with Jaitley on key issues of India''s concern, they also wanted the minister to keep them informed on the developing situation so that they could provide specific suggestions on any particular issue that comes up during WTO talks.

20,CM asks party leaders to restrain from statements,"GUNTUR: Chief Minister and Telugu Desam Party (TDP) president N Chandrababu Naidu has asked the party leaders Alapati Rajendraprasad and Yarapathineni Srinivasa Rao to be restrained from issuing press statements.

He reportedly said that he was looking into the controversial comments made by health minister Kodela Sivaprasada Rao against Rajendraprasad and Rao.

Naidu told Rajendraprasad, when he contacted him on Tuesday, not to go to media in a hurry to condemn the minister''s statements as it would go against the party''s interests.

Sources said that the chief minister expressed his displeasure over the minister''s comments against the party''s senior leaders. ""I will certainly look into the issue and I will talk to him (Kodela). Don''t worry about such things, I am here to protect you,"" Naidu reportedly assured the leaders.

Kodela Sivaprasada Rao termed both former minister Rajendraprasad and former MLA Yarapathineni Srinivasa Rao as traitors in an interview with a vernacular daily.

These comments have created ripples in the party circles. The followers of Alapati Rajendraprasad and Yarapathineni Srinivasa Rao brought pressure on them to allow them to react on the minister''s statement as it was too damaging. But they pacified the activists and told them that the issue was in the notice of the party president Chandrababu Naidu and there was no need to worry about it.

Meanwhile, the district party president Dhullipalla Narendrakumar held discussions with Yarapathineni Srinivasa Rao and suggested that it would be better to leave the issue to the party president''s discretion instead of going to press.

The differences between the health minister Kodela Sivaprasada Rao and his detractors in the party have reached a flash point with the former launching a diatribe against his rivals.
