0,UP govt to file new affidavit in Babri case,"LUCKNOW: In a damage control exercise over the storm on the Ayodhya issue, the UP government on Monday swiftly decided to file a supplementary affidavit before the Supreme Court on Tuesday to stoutly defend that there was no change in the stand taken over by the government in 1993.

Although admitting a â€˜clerical mistakeâ€™ in the affidavit filed on October 18, 2003 by the government before the apex court, chief secretary AP Singh at a hurriedly-summoned press conference clarified that the inadvertent error was introduction of the word â€˜wrongâ€™ in place of â€˜deniedâ€™ in the affidavit. And this, he said, was beyond the official brief and the approval of chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav.

He said that a news agency report based on the use of word â€˜wrongâ€™ had created misgivings in peoplesâ€™ mind. He said the government had fixed up the accountability for the lapse and removed forthrightly advocate on record of Supreme Court,R C Verma.

Likewise, he said, inquiry was being conducted to find the fault of officer of the law department, who actually had signed the affidavit. Since the officer in question had been promoted and had become the judge, the government could not take any action against him, CS explained.

An agency report to this effect, however, put the government in a tight spot, which was vehemently criticised by its political rivals as well as the Muslim organisations. For the government headed by Mulayam Singh Yadav, who has always assiduously cultivated a secular image , disquiet among the minorities left it rattled. The government found itself on the receiving end in the face of mounting criticism for softening its stand.

But terming the controversy as unfortunate, the CS said that the government had filed affidavit before the Apex Court in response to its notice on a writ petition filed by one Mohd Hashim challenging the CBI Rae Bareli court verdict , in which Union home minister LK Advani was given a clean chit and charge sheet was upheld against other leaders in connection with the Ayodhya demolition conspiracy case.

Explaining the governmentâ€™s view point, the CS said that since the matter was being probed by the Liberhan Commission and also under consideration of the apex court besides investigation by the CBI, the UP government had not held any independent inquiry into this. So the government was not in a position to comment much on this issue. The stand taken by the government in 1993 has not changed,the CS said.

1,ITI principal dies while catching thief,"CHANDIGARH: A vigilant act of catching the petrol thief cost the principal of Industrial Training Institute (ITI) of his life.

Shiv Raj Singh, 42, died while struggling to catch hold of a petrol thief at his residence in Sector 27 on Monday evening.

The thief, identified as Mohammad Parvez, a resident of Indira Colony, Manimajra was overpowered by neighbours and handed over to the police.

There are contradictory statements about the cause of death and police are investigating into the matter.

A theft case had been registered against Parvez and Singh''s dead body had been sent for the post mortem examination to ascertain the exact cause of death, the police said.

Enquiries revealed that the incident took place when Shiv Raj Singh saw Parvez taking out petrol from his scooter parked inside the house. With a hockey stick in the hand, he came downstairs and apprehended Parvez, who managed to free himself and ran towards the main road.

Singh chased him and overpowered him again and cried for help. After this, according to one his neighbours, the principal fainted. Meanwhile, some neighbours came to his help and caught hold of Parvez.

Singh was rushed to the Sector 32 government college and hospital, where he was declared brought dead.

Some neighbours said that Singh died of a cardiac arrest, while others suspected that he might have succumbed to injuries inflicted by Parvez.

Singh, who is survived by his wife and son, was popular for the modernisation done by him at the ITI.

2,SP minister elected; BJP faces setback,"LUCKNOW: In what appears to be a setback to the BJP as well as the Congress, the ruling Samajwadi Party candidate from Badaun, Banwari Singh, who is also a minister in the Mulayam cabinet, is all set to be declared elected unopposed.

The unopposed election of the SP candidate came following the Election Commission rejecting the BJP petition for fresh nominations in the district. The party had alleged that proposers of the BJP candidate RS Sakya were intimidated and kidnapped by the goons of the ruling party. The Congress, too, had levelled similar charges saying that proposers of its candidate Mehboob Ali were forced to withdraw in favour of the ruling party candidate.

BJP state president Vinay Katiyar had charged the Badaun district administration with kidnapping two proposers of the party candidate. They had submitted a memorandum to Governor Vishnukant Shastri and filed a petition before the Election Commission demanding to begin the nomination process afresh.

â€œWe had directed the returning officer (RO) to conduct an inquiry into allegations. He had sent a report on Saturday stating that proposers, when called for the probe, claimed that their signatures were forged and they were not present during nominations of the BJP and the Congress candidates. They had filed affidavits to this effect,â€� stated a state election official.

On the basis of the ROâ€™s findings, the official said that â€œthe commission has rejected petition of the BJPâ€�. â€œSince nominations of the other two candidates in fray in Badaun have been rejected, the remaining candidate would be elected unopposed,â€� announced the official.

The decision of the commission has come as a shot in the arms of the ruling coalition which had received a setback following the commissionâ€™s decision to debar newly elected members of Nagar Panchayats, Nagar Mahapalikas and Nagar Nigams to vote in the council polls for local bodies on 36 seats, slated to be held on December 1, 2003.

The BJP has, however, rapped the commission for playing a partisan role. Party president Vinay Katiyar has threatened to file a case against the commissionâ€™s arbitrary decision. â€œIt was unfortunate that the commission without probing the Badaun incident took an arbitrary decision. We are seeking legal opinion to file a case,â€� said Katiyar.

Meanwhile, on the last day of withdrawals on Monday, 210 candidates remained in the fray for 36 council seats. A total of 247 candidates had filed nominations. During scrutiny, papers of 15 were rejected while 22 withdrew till Monday. After unopposed election in Badaun, polls for the remaining 35 seats will be held on December 1, 2003.

3,'Developmental security to fight corruption',"NEW DELHI: To combat communalism and corruption, the governance process should be more in tune with the people''s needs and the specific problems faced by the poor in the country.

This was one of the observations made by experts at a symposium on development security, organised by the Independent Commission for People''s Rights and Development (ICPRD) on Monday.

Eminent individuals like former MPs, Jaipal Reddy and Kuldip Nayyar, Union minister of state for external affairs, Digvijay Singh, former DGP of Punjab, K P S Gill and former police commissioner of Mumbai, J F Rebeiro participated in the discussion.

The essence of the debate, as emphasised upon by the member secretary of ICPRD, Nandini Azad, was how poverty and scarcity of resources give rise to social and economic conflict.

Hence, the need to promote ""developmental security"", to ensure the security of people as well as political stability in society.

""The governance proc-ess, as we see, continues to be indifferent to the problems faced by the poor in their daily living. As such denial of development and consequent identity crisis leads to violence in society,"" said Azad.

But when it boils down to security in the city, Gill expressed the need for well-trained manpower for safeguarding the rights of the common man.

""What we need is a better response-mechanism from the police. To that very end, the basic qualification for being a part of the constabulary should be graduation. It is with education that one''s horizons expand and one is more sensitive to the needs of the people,"" he said.

4,Senior citizen attacked in fourth incident,"PUNE: In the fourth incident of its kind this month, a senior citizen was attacked and robbed of her ornaments worth Rs 20,000 by two unidentified persons in the garden of her Parijat society residence at Bibvewadi on Sunday morning.

According to the Sahakarnagar police, Mangala Phadnis (75) and her visiting sister, Nirmala Sathe (70), were on their way back from their morning walk and were near the garden gate when the two attackers came on a motorcycle and sought directions.

After this, Sathe entered the residence while Phadnis was in the garden. Suddenly, the two returned, and one of them, after pointing a pistol at Phadnis, snatched her walking stick and hit her with it on the forehead.

Not stopping at that, they then forced her to give them her bangles and a gold chain worth Rs 20,000. Hearing the commotion, Sathe rushed out and cried for help, which alerted their tenant, Sanjay Kulkarni (44).

Seeing Kulkarni approaching, the two escaped on the motorcycle. The police said Phadnis stays alone, her son works in Khanapur.

Phadnis was rushed to hospital and is believed to be stable. A case has been registered with the Sahakarnagar police. The police are preparing sketches of the two.

5,Intra-party feuds plague Congress,"PUNE: The city Congress appears to be divided house. Despite elections to the state assembly and Lok Sabha round the corner, elected members of the party are busy levelling allegations and counter-allegations of land grabbing and illegal constructions against each other.

Congress corporator Hulgesh Chalwadi on Monday staged a hunger strike at the party headquarters, Congress Bhavan, to protest against the demolition of an illegal school in Vidyanagar, Dhanori.

The unauthorised Vishwabharti school, constructed by Chalwadiâ€™s close relatives, was partially razed by the civic staff on November 12, a day after it was inaugurated by state minister Chandrakant Chhajed.

Interestingly, the school building was pulled down by the civic staff after local Congress corporator Madhukar Jakkal complained against it.

Although admitting that he did not seek the PMCâ€™s permission before building the school, Chalwadi argued that the civic body was in the process of granting permission and that it should consider his case since he was starting a school, not commercial activity.

Chalwadi not only staged a hunger strike, but also put up banners demanding that his party initiate action against Jakkal.

When contacted, city Congress chief Mohan Joshi asserted that the party was not in favour of protecting illegal constructions, but declined comment on the squabble between Jakkal and Chalwadi.

Although the police and junior civic officers have accused Chalwadi of attempting to stall civic demolition, top civic officers are averse to speak about it, let alone lodging a police complaint against the corporator.

Sources said a state minister was pressurising the civic officers, fearing that if Chalwadi was found guilty of the alleged act, the opposition parties will demand his ouster.

Last month, municipal commissioner Sanjay Kumar had disqualified BJP corporator Hemant Rasne for allegedly preventing the demolition of illegal cracker stalls in the Phule market area.

In an another intra-party dispute, group of Congress corporators, led by Anil Bhosale, has demanded that the civic standing committee reconsider its decision to divert Rs 25 lakh, set aside for developmental works in Dalit community areas, for constructing a building near Swargate.

The civic general body has resolved to allot a prime 5,000 sq ft municipal land at Swargate to a womenâ€™s organisation, patronised by a former Congress woman mayor.

The ex-mayor not only wants the land, but also wants the old municipal building at the site to be demolished and a new building constructed so that it could be allotted to her organisation.

However, there is no provision in the civic budget for constructing the building. Hence, the standing committee had diverted funds set aside for the development of Dalit vastis (areas with thick Dalit population) for the construction of the building.

â€œThe PMC has to carry out several planned works in Dalit vastis and hence, the funds set aside for it should not be diverted,â€� Bhosale demanded, asking the committee to reconsider its decision.

6,Estranged hubby attempts suicide at High Court,"HYDERABAD: An estranged husband jumped from the High Court building on Monday evening after the court refused to intervene in his marital dispute with his wife.

K Balaji (23), an employee of the naval armament depot in Visakhapatnam, was admitted to Osmania General Hospital with grievous injuries. His condition is grim, Charminar police inspector K Ramchandran said.

Balaji filed a habeas corpus petition in the High Court seeking production in court of his wife, Parvati Devi, alleging that she was being illegally detained by her relatives despite having married him six months ago.

Parvati appeared in court but said she preferred living with her relatives. The court attempted to counsel the couple, but when Parvati refused to live with Balaji, the judge dismissed the petition.

The court started hearing another case when a shout was heard from outside the room. Balaji went up to the roof and threatened to end his life. Advocates, court staff and a couple of his friends tried to cajole him not to jump. Balaji, standing on the edge of the roof, wanted to know from his wife if she still loved him, eye-witnesses said. She refused to say so and accused him of harassing her. Hearing this, Balaji jumped and was grievously hurt.

Even as Balaji lay on the ground, none of those present made any move to shift him to hospital immediately. It was left for the police to take him to hospital.

Parvati later told reporters at the Charminar police station that she left Balaji four months ago as she could not live with him. â€œHe filed cases in Visakhapatnam and in the High Court that I was being forcibly kept from him,â€� she said.

However, she took ill and was taken to a private hospital for treatment as she began to suffer from hypertension after questioning by the police.

7,Medico's suicide: Police quiz seniors,"ANANTAPUR: Tension prevailed on the Government Medical College campus here on Monday after the parents of a medico Y Prasad, who committed suicide by hanging in his hostel room on Sunday, reportedly beat up principal P Chandrasekhar and other college staff.

Prasad, a second year MBBS student, was allegedly threatened by his seniors and the college principal for writing a letter to Chandrasekhar regarding ragging in the college.

Sources said that Prasadâ€™s parents, Y Venkatappa and Y Kamalamma, who came to take the body from the postmortem room of the medical college, turned their ire on the college principal. However, they were pacified by doctors and other medicos and taken away from the college premises.

Anantapur DSP Kannaji Rao told The Times of India that six senior medicos â€” Sudhir Kumar, O Ram Fakir, R Raghavendra Reddy, S M Shareef, M Ramesh Babu and N Chiranjeevi â€” who have been named by Prasad in his letter were being questioned to ascertain the facts. Two other students, Pavan Kumar Reddy and S Kuladeep, are also being interrogated. Police recovered three letters from Prasadâ€™s shirt pocket in which the names of six senior medicos were mentioned.

Police sources said that the accused reportedly went to Prasadâ€™s room on Saturday and forced him to write a letter stating that they were in no way concerned with the ragging incidents in the college.

Prasad was a native of Nallaguttapalli village in Kallakada mandal of Chittoor district.

Police said that an anonymous letter on the ragging of juniors was written to the principal three months ago. The principal reportedly traced the letter to Prasad. Since then he was being reportedly harassed by his seniors for complaining against ragging. The principal also reportedly chided Prasad for writing the letter.

Meanwhile, the college principal told reporters that Prasad was â€œpsychologically unstable.â€� He gave a clean chit to all the accused students who have been named by the deceased medico in his letter.

Meanwhile, several students led by SFI and AISF barged into the medical college and manhandled the principal. They also damaged the furniture in his chamber.

In a retaliatory move, medical college students attacked the SFI and AISF leaders resulting in injuries to six of them.

The Two Town police rushed to the college and dispersed the warring groups. Eleven persons including student leaders Vemaiah Yadav, Vemanarayana, Manohar, Nagendra and others were taken into custody following a complaint by the principal.

In a related development, student organisations held a dharna in front of the Two Town police station and S K University campus demanding release of their leaders.

A police picket has been posted on the college campus to monitor the situation.

8,PCB nets errant govt hospitals,"KOLKATA: The West Bengal Pollution Control Board and state health department are in a tiff over disposal of biomedical waste in medical colleges and hospitals.

The PCB wants to impose fines on government hospitals failing to clear the waste.

In a note to health secretary Asim Barman, the PCB has urged to impose penalty on hospitals if they do not adhere to the norms which exist for private health care providers. â€œIf they can be punished, why not the government hospitals?â€� asked senior PCB official.

Though the PCB can penalise the hospitals, it feels the health department should take the step. â€œThe ultimate penalty for a private health care unit is cancellation of their licence, which cannot be enforced on government hospitals. But there is no policy for the government units which are the biggest pollutants in this category,â€� a PCB official said.

With a facility to treat biomedical waste already started in Howrah where all hospitals are obliged to dispose their trash, imposing the fine is even more justifiable, feel Board officials. â€œNow, either the government or the hospital individually needs to tie up with the service provider to dispose their waste,â€� they pointed out.

â€œWe have appealed to the health department for introducing a fine in case the rules are flouted. But there seems to be a confusion , â€� commented PCB chairman Hirak Ghosh.

He claimed that his department was waiting for the implementation of the proposal for quite some time. â€œSince the health department is already facing so much turmoil, it seems that the issue has slipped from their minds,â€� he added.

If the need be, PCB will start penalising the errant hospitals. â€œWe will start issuing notices soon,â€� Ghosh asserted. The health department has little choice but to implement it. â€œI have already spoken to Barman, but he is very busy these days,â€� he said.

9,MCH shifts into election mode,"HYDERABAD: The Municipal Corporation of Hyderabad (MCH) will conduct meetings with Residential Welfare Associations and Non Governmental Organisations (NGOs) in a bid to make people aware of the various new rules issued by the Election Commission.

The Election Commission has announced that the final revision of the electoral rolls would be held from November 27 to December 15. The final electoral rolls will be published by January 20.

Claims and objections will be received at Election Returning Officersâ€™ (all Deputy Municipal Commissioners and additional commissioner, Secunderabad) offices and Assistant EROsâ€™ (nine surrounding municipalities, Mandal Revenue Officers of Hayatnagar and Saroornagar) offices. The claims and objections will also be accepted at the 3,860 buildings designated to be polling stations.

â€œMeanwhile, we will conduct meetings with residential welfare associations, NGOs where our officers will read the relevant part of electoral roll to inform residents if anyoneâ€™s names are missing from the rolls,â€� MCH commissioner Chitra Ramachandran said.

The representative of the Residential Welfare Association can give the names of people for inclusion in the electoral rolls, and also objections on behalf of their residents, the commissioner said.

However, if any false representation is made, he will be punished under Section 31 of the Representatives of Peopleâ€™s Act, 1950, an MCH official said.

A person should have attained 18 years of age before January 1, 2004 and should be an ordinary resident for having an eligibility to register, he added.

The official said if a person wants to enrol his or her name for the first time after attaining 18 years, he or she should now mention at least two of his family members whose names are already in the rolls. Similarly, anyone who has not registered their name in the electoral roll though they have attained 20 years of age should give reasons why they have not enrolled till now as per the new Election Commission rules, he said.

People who have changed their residence from one constituency to another constituency should also furnish the addresses of both the old and the present residences.

10,Khammam TDP gets down to election strategy,"KHAMMAM: Telugu Desam Party leaders in the district have begun discussions in earnest to firm up strategies for the Assembly polls.

TDP senior leader and roads and buildings minister Tummala Nageswara Rao is said to have come up with a two-pronged strategy to face the probable alliance of Congress and left-wing parties in the district. The strategy, includes luring intellectuals into the party fold and also send feelers to senior leaders belonging to other parties. The TDP is planning to rope in a former minister, an IPS officer and a top industrialist into the party, sources said.

The TDP won three seats - Sattupalli (Tummala Nageswara Rao), Madhira (Kondabala Koteswara Rao) and Burgampadu (Tati Venkateswarlu) in the 1999 elections. However, recent surveys reportedly revealed that the latter two will have a tough time in retaining their seats. The surveys also indicated that the TDP had made some gains in Bhadrachalam and Yellendu, where the party lacks mass leaders.

According to Tummalaâ€™s close aides, the TDP will try to reach out to both the Congress and the left-wing parties voters to defeat the alliance candidates. For instance, if the Khammam Assembly seat is left to the CPI by the Congress in seat adjustments, the TDP would try to wean away the Congress voters. Similar would be the strategy if CPI supports a Congress candidate. The TDP is firm on snatching Palair, Sujathanagar and Yellendu sets from its opponents.

Tummala Nageswara Rao who was here on Sunday, told The Times of India that they were finalising poll strategies much in advance for a headstart over their rivals.

12,Officials asked to ensure fair polls,"GAYA: Poll officials deputed at the 246 polling stations of the Barachatti assembly constituency and those on patrolling and other poll-related work have been warned against any slackness in the discharge of their duty of ensuring free, fair and peaceful election.

The Barachatti bypoll, necessitated by the death of Bhagwati Devi, is scheduled for Thursday. The 1,95,000-plus voters, including 95,917 women voters, would, for the first time, be exercising their franchise through the electronic voting machine (EVM).

A joint order, issued by Gaya district magistrate Brajesh Mehrotra and the superintendent of police Sanjay Singh, while cautioning the poll personnel against any slackness on their part, says that punitive action under Sections 129, 14 and 134A would be taken against the erring officials.

Interestingly, the maiden use of electronic voting machines is being made in one of the most underdeveloped areas of the country with a sizeable population of Dalits and other underprivileged sections. According to official sources, the level of literacy in the three blocks under the Barachatti assembly area is low even by Bihar''s standard which unfavourably compares with other parts of the country. A reliable estimate puts the percentage of illiterate males in the Barachatti, Mohanpur and Dobhi blocks at no less than 45. The percentage of illiterate women is said to be about 70.

In order to familiarise the voters with the functioning of the electronic voting machines, 15 group of trainers moved in the 48 panchayats coming under the Barachatti assembly area. Two training camps were organised in each block. Mock polling will also take place at the polling station shortly before the commencement of the actual poll to refresh the polling agents about the operation of the electronic voting machines.

According to DPRO K K Upadhyay, the response of the illiterate voters to the EVM training programme has been very encouraging.

In view of the Naxal threat in the area and past experiences, the polling parties have been directed to assemble at specially identified clusters for better security and mobility. Each polling station has been provided with two sections of the police force, comprising two head constables and eight constables. Besides, the deployment of static forces, mobile police parties have also been formed.

The entire assembly area has been divided into 11 zones and each zone has been put under the charge of an official of the rank of the ADM. The district administration has declared all the 246 polling stations as sensitive.

Altogether nine candidates, including Samta Devi of the RJD, Rajesh Rajak of the NDA, CPI-ML candidate Ramdeep and independent candidate Ramdeep are contesting the election.

13,"For police, preventive arrests are the cure","CHANDIGARH: ''Suspicious'' persons on the move at night and those who are expected to commit cognizable offences in the city might just be put behind bars by the UT police which is on the lookout for shady characters.

The number of ''preventive'' arrests this year are four times more as compared to the figure last year. There is increased emphasis on ''preventive'' arrests to check crime in the city and keep a tab on miscreants.

""Whosoever fails to establish his identity or his conduct, or is suspected to commit an offence is liable to be arrested,"" explained a police officer.

The arrests are made under Sections 109, 107, 150, 151, of the CrPC and various provisions of the Police Act. Apparently, the main target target are migrants, who do not have a permanent residence.

Till October this year, 413 persons were arrested under Section 109 CrPC, as compared to 117 till October last year.

Similarly during the same corresponding period, 1,127 persons were arrested under section 107\151, CrPC, against 781 last year; 391 were arrested under section 107/150 as compared to 394 last year and 304 persons were arrested under section 34/5/61 of the Police Act compared to 118 last year.

Police justify this crime prevention methodology. They say that the crime figures have taken a plunge.

Other officer, however, feel that these provisions could be misused. They add that innocent persons could be arrested to show greater efficiency.

Critics, on the other hand, want to know why then has the police not been able to solve any cases after making these ''preventive'' arrests.

The ""offenders"" are then produced before the judicial magistrate, who releases them after getting a surety of good behaviour. Police say arrests are expected to act as a deterrent for habitual offenders, thieves, persons shielding accused or those seen in the company of suspects.

""It is like arresting a person before he commits a crime,"" says a seasoned police officer.

Amanullah, present in the court, also stated in his affidavit that HC order has already been complied with, adding that since the screening panel found the claims of petitioners, Dhanji Chaubey and others, for their absorption in the service of Dhanwantari Ayurvedic College at Ahirauli (Buxar) to be fake, their claims were rejected and a notification to this effect was issued by the department. The court had summoned Ahmed and members of the screening panel to explain why the petitioners'' services were not absorbed by the college despite the HC order dated August 24, 2000, and the constitution of the screening committee to examine the claims of the petitioners.

15,CBI to probe violence against Assamese,"PATNA: Succumbing to the pressure of Assam government, the Bihar government has handed over to the CBI the probe into the incidents of violence against Assamese train passengers in Bihar.

â€œI talked to the Union home secretary. He asked me to send the requisition immediately and the CBI would accept it,â€� said chief secretary KAH Subramanian in a press conference at the CM â€™s house here on Monday. â€œWe want that an impartial probe be held into the entire episode so that the guilty can be identified,â€� he said, adding that the Bihar government has asked for 20 companies of the Central forces for providing security to railway passengers.

RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav accused the Shiv Sena and the BJP MP from Katihar of starting the violence against Assamese in Katihar. â€œI have talked to the Assam chief minister twice today (Monday). Sporadic violence has taken place against Biharis. I want it to stop immediately. Violence will not help either Bihar or Assam,â€� he said while stressing that the CBI would probe the entire episode, including the charges of rape and molestation of women.

Subramanian said the CBI is free to take action against MPs or MLAs if they are found guilty. â€œNobody will be shielded.â€�

17,"Shell, PSL cry foul over pipelines policy","NEW DELHI: Prospective investors have cried foul over the government''s move to appoint state-owned gas utility Gail India as the only agency that will be allowed to construct and operate pipelines for transporting gas in future.

In their inputs to the draft pipelines policy sought by the oil ministry, Royal Dutch Shell and domestic pipemakers PSL have underlined the need for an independent agency to ensure competition and keep transportation costs -- and ultimately gas prices -- low.

Shell has pointed out that infrastructure will grow faster and in a more cost-effective way if the players are allowed to make their choice according to needs.

The company said market economics will ensure that there was no duplication and the players would prefer to pool resources for economies of scale as future pipelines would operate on the common carrier principle.

Pipemaker PSL has told the ministry that execution of the entire gas grid by a single agency would not achieve cost-effectiveness. It said Gail buys pipes at costs that are 60 per cent more than similar projects being implemented worldwide.

PSL said the ""selection of the agency for construction of the proposed gas pipeline network should be awarded on the basis of benchmarking both on cost and quality of the most recent pipeline projects undertaken by two or three agencies such as GAIL, IOC or GSPL"".

The players have also raised questions on the issue of conflict of interest -- Gail''s double role as a gas trader and transporter.

Gail had, however, announced at a press conference a fortnight ago that it will split its two operations to take care of the players'' concerns.

The draft policy makes Gail the sole executing agency for all inter-state lines. This includes the Rs 20,000 crore, 7,900 km cross-country pipeline grid that will be the only passage for moving gas by public and private sector firms in future.

18,NRI's arrest embarrasses politicians,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The arrest of an NRI by CBI in Delhi last week on charges of embezzlement has put several politicians and bureaucrats in the state in an embarrassing position.

These politicians and bureaucrats had recently attended the Global Kerala Festival held in London of which Antony Joe Kingsley Fernandez was one of the chief organisers.

The arrest of Fernandez, hailing from Nagercoil in Tamil Nadu, on a charge of cheating a Delhi-based businessman and his son of Rs 65-crore came close on the heels of the London festival.

The mela, supported by Non Resident Keralites Affairs (NORKA) Deparment, was attended among others by over 100 invitees, including Union Minister O Rajagopal, state ministers M M Hassan, M V Raghavan and Cherkalam Abdullah, KPCC chief K Muraleedharan, BJP state president P S Sreedharan Pillai, former CPI-M MLA E Jayarajan and Chairman of Hindustan Latex Ltd G Rajmohan.

Interestingly, the NRI was present when Chief Minister A K Antony released the logo for the Global Fest and when Union Health Minister Sushma Swaraj opened the website for the same.

When contacted, Director General of Police Hormis Tharakan said no specific complaint had been received against Fernandez in the state. ""We are finding out his roots,"" he added.

19,"Chariots, balloon kick off campaign","NEW DELHI: The Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP) president Venkaiah Naidu formally flagged off the Delhi unitâ€™s poll campaign on Tuesday by setting off 70 chariots on the road. These chariots (regular 407 trucks) tableaux on them, depicting Congress misrule.

They depict five themes, like failure to provide water and power, the fast-running electricity meters, failure to control dengue, and â€˜â€˜Congress cultureâ€™â€™ as exemplified by the tandoor murder case.

These chariots will be made available for all the candidates in the 70 constituencies of Delhi. â€˜â€˜We are not encouraging negative campaigning. Instead, we are highlighting the performance of the NDA government,â€™â€™ said Naidu.

â€˜â€˜We have got different advertising agencies to make the tableaux so that each one looks different,â€™â€™ said Avinash Sood of the BJP Yuva Morcha, who is co-ordinating the despatch of these trucks to the various constituencies.

Audio cassettes with catchy songs on the same themes will be played as the chariots move along. â€˜â€˜We will, however, make sure that the loudspeakers are switched off after 10 pm,â€™â€™ said Sood. While the party was mum on the expenditure incurred on the chariots, it did say that since the EC had prescribed the use of only three vehicles per constituency, these trucks would be considered as one of the three vehicles used by the candidates.

The Congress launched a cold-air balloon in the shape of a Metro train to start its campaign. Designed by the head of its publicity committee, Vishwabandhu Gupta, the balloon is 60 feet long. It carried messages of the achievements of the Congress-led Delhi government.
