2,Heading towards water riots?,"LUCKNOW: The capital of Uttar Pradesh and the prime minister's constituency has more than its fair share of problems. With the authorities showing their back to the incessant water problems letting the city reel under severe water crisis, residents have resorted to staging agitations as the only ultimate weapon to get a solution. The day doesn't seem to be far away when the state capital will witness riots, this time, over precious water. Water crisis continues to dog city folks belying tall claims of the water supply authorities about improvement in services. Not willing to bear the brunt anymore, some of the aggressive ones have taken to streets in scorching summer heat, only to get lathi-charged by the police. The hours of water supply are scarce and the moment water starts to drip, a battle ensues to be the first to collect maximum water. Those lucky enough to collect some water finally realise that the water is polluted and not safe enough for drinking. There is hardly enough water to drink, leave alone using it for other purposes, says a harried resident of Martinpurwa. The locality, which is worse than a slum, never gets any official taking note of its problems. When residents tried to raise their voices, they were treated with vengeance and brutally lathi-charged by the police. Residents of several localities like Jiyamau, Dalibagh, Madiaon, Jankipuram, Haiderganj, Aminabad, Geeta Palli, Ghasiyari Mandi, Chowk, Nishatganj, Kashmiri Mohalla, Lakedmandi in Daliganj, Bhawaniganj and Rakabganj have decided to go a step further. Citizens of Ghosiyana in Kaiserbagh falling in the Peer Jaleel ward have decided to sit on a hunger strike shortly, if the water woes were not immediately dealt with. Residents boisterously fighting for every drop of water has become a regular sight in the Dalibagh and Paper Mill Colonies. According to a report, a youth was caught stealing water from a neighbour's tank in the night in the City Station area. But with every locality reeling under acute water shortage, the 'beg borrow steal' method has failed. Residents of Narhi, which includes localities like Raghuvir Dayal lane, Saket Palli, Mirabai Marg, Radha Krishna Mandir lane, Mallahapur have lost all hopes of getting sufficient water for survival. Out of the three tube-wells in the area, only one remains to be functional. Residents say that the tube-wells belong to the Victorian era and are incapable to serve to the entire population. The problem is that the population is growing up and the authorities are not increasing storage space for water, explained a resident of Tikonia park. Alambagh is yet another classic example of the heights of callousness. The malin bastis like Dhobi Ghat, Matapur-ka-hata and Shahi Masjid basti do not have a water pipeline at all. More so, there is not a single hand pump for about two kilometres. The residents have to walk miles to get a single bucket of water. Even the colonies of Adarshnagar and Arjunnagar in Alambagh have only two out of nine hand pumps functional. All said and done, residents are no more willing to let the administration get away after paying whopping amounts of water taxes. In the coming days, the city be witness to a number of agitations, dharnas and hunger strikes, all for water. Water pipeline in the Chowk locality, that got damaged on Thursday, is still being repaired by the Jal Sansthan employees. However, the process will take some time, according to vice- chairman Rashid Khan. Mayor Dr SC Rai has called a meeting on May 28 to tackle the water woes in the city and come up with some solutions.

5,RLD ministers to pull out of Mayawati govt,"NEW DELHI: In what may be a prelude to withdrawing support from the BSP-BJP coalition in Uttar Pradesh, all the five ministers of RLD on Saturday decided to pull out of the Mayawati government, a day after party chief Ajit Singh quit the Union cabinet. All the five RLD ministers will resign from the Mayawati government, Singh told reporters after an hour-long meeting of the party's 12 MLAs and central office-bearers at his residence to discuss the future course of action. The development assumes significance as the support of RLD's 14 MLAs may be crucial for the survival of the Mayawati government which has a wafer thin majority in the assembly. Asked whether the RLD will withdraw from the coalition in the state, Singh said the party office- bearers and MLAs would meet within three to four days, either in Delhi or elsewhere, to take a final decision on the issue. Twelve MLAs including four ministers —Kokab Hamid, Anuradha Chaudhary, Thakur Tejpal Singh and Swami Omvesh —attended the meeting as also the press conference addressed by Ajit Singh. While Babu Lal, Agra MLA and minister, is away to Vaishno Devi, another MLA Samarpal Singh was suspended from the party earlier for demanding that the party severe its ties with the Mayawati government. Asked when would the ministers quit, Singh said they had handed over their resignations to him and would would go back to Lucknow to submit their letters to the governor. Hamid said Singh has been authorised to take all decisions about the party strategy. Asked whether the RLD would withdraw support to the Mayawati government, Singh said the office- bearers of the party would meet shortly to chalk out the future course of action. I cannot say anything about withdrawal of support to Mayawati government. Whatever steps are taken would be taken after taking party MLAs and office-bearers into confidence, he said. Asked why he was taking time to finalise the party's strategy, Singh said, we have to have some time to discuss among ourselves before taking any decision. Party sources said the RLD would in the next three-to-four days talk to like-minded political parties, including the Congress and Samajwadi Party, to formulate a future common strategy, if possible. About his resignation from the Union cabinet, Singh said it was due to NDA government's anti- farmer policies. Asked why he was raising the issue after quitting the government, the former agriculture minister said that he was criticised for raising farmers' issue being a minister.

7,Kerala govt ignoring terrorist threat: Pillai,"KOZHIKODE: BJP National Executive member and Kerala State President-elect P S Sreedharan Pillai today alleged that the UDF Government in Kerala was ""giving silent permission"" to heinous activities of terrorists. Addressing journalists here, he said the busting of terrorist rackets at Surankot had revealed links the terrorist had with extremist elements in Kerala. ""The UDF is a silent spectator when terrorists make the state a target of attack by planning a series of bomb blasts. The numbers obtained from satellite phones seized from terrorists clearly indicate their connections with people in certain pockets of Malappuram"", Pillai charged. Pillai said the development assumed significance in the context of the Marad carnage that claimed nine lives, and reiterated his demand that the investigation into the incident be entrusted to the CBI.

Puttannaiah on Saturday said that hundreds of farmers who are yet to get their dues from the sugar factories in Mandya district will stage a dharna in front of chief minister Krishna's residence in Bangalore on June 5. At a press meet here, Puttannaiah held Krishna responsible for the suicide attempt made by Tammannegowda from Marikadanadoddi village in Maddur taluk. If Krishna had intervened and succeeded in disbursing the money owed by the sugar factories to the sugarcane growers from Mandya district, Tammannegowda would not have attempted suicide, he said, adding, that if anything happened to Tammannegowda, the farmers would not spare Krishna. He said Tammannegowda frequently visited the authorities of Chamundeshwari sugar factory in K.M. Doddi and even wrote a letter to them on May 12 seeking release of his dues. But the factory authorities neither replied to his letter nor did they disburse Rs 21,600 due to him. On May 22, Tammannegowda went directly to the factory Chief Manager's chamber and demanded that the latter immediately disburse his dues, Puttannaiah claimed, adding when the manager behaved arrogantly, Tammannegowda consumed poison before the factory gates.

15,J&K govt to retire non-performing staff,"SRINAGAR: In an effort to streamline the functioning of the various departments and right-size their workforce, Jammu and Kashmir government has decided to prematurely retire those employees whose performance has not been up to the mark over the years. Chief Minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed has issued orders to all departments to identify dead wood which would be discarded to create vacancies for younger blood, sources close to the coalition government told PTI here today. The sources said the government, through premature retirement scheme, has decided to do away with employees whose annual performance reports (APR) did not meet the expectations. The employees who are above 48 years of age and have completed 22 years in service and their APRs do not meet the expectations of the government would be retrenched through the voluntary retirement scheme, the sources said. The cases of employees identified by the department heads, under the scheme, would be sent to governor for retrenchment under Article 26 of the state constitution, they said. The move is aimed at removing the inefficient employees and creating opportunities for younger blood to improve the working of the government offices, the sources said. Several senior officials of the state government admit that the workforce in several departments was too oversized and many employees show their face only in the beginning of a month to collect salary cheques. The sources, however, said the process will be time-consuming and it would not be easy to implement the new scheme and would probably be met by litigations by the affected employees.

17,Pak govt to discuss Musharraf's dual position,"ISLAMABAD: As the six month-long deadlock between the Pakistan government and the opposition over the legality of Pervez Musharraf's constitutional amendments continues, Prime Minister Mir Zafarulah Khan Jamali has called a meeting of top opposition leaders on May 30 to reach an agreement on when the President should relinquish his post as Army Chief. Ahead of the fresh meeting, Jamali has began consultation with a number of allied parties which back the ruling pro-military Pakistan Muslim League-Q (PML-Q) to devise a strategy. Jamali's decision to call the meeting follows the failure of a 11-member committee of ruling and opposition parties to reach an agreement. Submitting the report to Jamali, the head of the committee, Speaker Chowdhary Amir Hussain, highlighted the demand of the opposition parties that Musharraf should quit as Chief of the army at least by Pakistan Day on Aug 14, 2004. The opposition parties are demanding that Musharraf should give a tacit commitment to quit the post so the modified proposals of his constitutional amendments could be approved in Parliament. Meanwhile, top leaders of the combined opposition in the National Assembly would meet here tomorrow in an attempt to evolve a unified approach on talks with the government. Ahead of the meeting, the six party Islamist alliance, Muthahida Majlis Amal would hold a meeting of its supreme council to finalise a strategy. The MMA meeting assumed significance in the wake of reports that a section of the alliance's leadership is inclined to strike a compromise deal with Musharraf. Though MMA vice-president and Chief of Jamat Islami Qazi Hussain Ahmed wants Musharraf to quit as Chief of Army by August 14 this year, Maulana Fazlur Rahman, who heads the dominant Jamat Ulema Islami favours greater flexibility, the reports said. Rehman is reportedly not averse to the idea of giving a two year dead-line for Musharraf. But he too wants the President to announce a date by which he would quit the Chief of Army post. The government is keen that the deadlock is broken before Musharraf's visit to the US on June 24.

Chief Minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed has asked the general administration department to expedite the process of compilation of records of all those officers who were unpopular and against whom no corruption cases were made out by the previous National Conference government. State finance minister Muzzafar Hussain Beig said that some of these reportedly corrupt officers had excellent annual performance reports (APRs), hence such APRs could not be relied upon while deciding their fate. The government also contemplates to retrench through VRS scheme employees who are above 48 years of age and have completed 22 years in service. Senior officials of the state government have also reported that workforce in several departments was oversized and many employees came to office only on pay day. All heads of departments have been asked to furnish staff strength and track record of employees to the general administration department. The de-weeding of ""corrupt"" elements from the administration would create vacancies in various departments besides offering a clean and vibrant administration.

23,"No report on farmers' suicide, says minister","LUDHIANA: Union minister of state for agriculture Hukam Deo Narayan Yadav on Sunday claimed to have received no report from the Punjab government regarding the suicides committed by the farmers in the state. Yadav disclosed this while talking to newspersons at Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) on the way to Sangrur to preside over a seminar organised by BJP Kisan Morcha wing on the problem of receding water level in the state. Stating that the increasing number of suicides are symptomatic of the farmers plight, Yadav categorically stated the states were directly responsible for the situation. ""We are asked questions about this in the Parliament based on the media reports but we are helpless because no state has ever provided information about this,"" he said. When asked that is this meant the Union government has no responsibility, the minister while harping on their helplessness said even a probe commission could be constituted only on the recommendation of the states. He pointed out that it was sad that agriculture was being politicised like other institutions. He said it was happening in Punjab but declined to elaborate when asked. Yadav informed that the seminar at Sangrur was being organised by agriculture technology management agency (ATMA), a government agency. He added that farmers having different political affiliation were welcome to participate in it despite that fact that it was being organised with active cooperation of the state kisan morcha. An invite sent by the morcha convener Jaswant Singh Chhapa to newspersons clearly mentioned that morcha was the organiser. Interestingly, it was the first seminar in the state organised at the fag end of five year's countrywide ATMA project. The morcha planned to organise three more such seminars in the state. About the government approval to Johl committee report on diversification, Yadav said it was under consideration. The minister said he did not have ready information when asked about any tangible outcome of government efforts so far to bring about diversification in agriculture. However, he claimed that some progress has been made in terms of increased production of vegetables, fruits and dairy farming. Stressing on the sustained awareness campaign to wean the farmers away from set crop pattern based on wheat and rice, the minister rued lack of optimum results due to assured irrigation system.
