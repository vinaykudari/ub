1,Punjab govt makes transporters pay more,"CHANDIGARH: Even as Punjab financial situation continues to remain grim, the state government on Friday decided to armtwist private transporters to shell out Rs 22 crore extra revenue annually. The cabinet sub-committee on fiscal mana gement , which met here on Friday, also decided to prepare contingency plans to jack up the state revenue by at least Rs 1,000 crores in addition to the current Rs 11,000 crore it is collecting annually. Putting an extra burden on private bus transporters the state government decided to raise transport fee charged from them from Rs 5.18 per km to Rs 5.75 per km. The decision, which has been taken in the face of stiff defiance from some of the cabinet ministers as well, is proposed to fetch the government an additional Rs 16 crore annually. Similarly, truck operators would also be paying more for their movement in the state. In different categories the government proposes to raise the trasnportation fee at least by 50 per cent which would make the government richer by Rs five crores annually. Earlier, however, the proposal was to effect a hundred per cent hike in the fee to pocket the targetted amount of Rs ten crores. Expressing grave concern at the grim financial situation in the state, so much so that practically no funds have been available for development works, the cabinet sub-committee directed major revenue-earning departments like excise and transport to prepare contingency plans to shore up revenue position. Different departments would be submitting their proposals to the cabinet sub-committee shortly.

2,Rotation rules at GM crops panel,"NEW DELHI: Four chiefs in five months. If that sounds like a precarious job, it's also one that becomes controversial with each meeting. It's the job of chairperson of the genetic engineering approval committee (GEAC) which is coordinated by environment ministry and which clears genetically-modified (GM) crops for . Till the game of passing-the-parcel began, A M Gokhale chaired this committee. He moved out of the ministry in January. A new additional secretary, Meena Gupta, held fort briefly before the charge was given to Sushma Choudhary. Now, it's Duggal's turn amid rumours that he, too, may move out. Where does this leave GEAC's workload on deciding the fate of GM crops and creating a monitoring mechanism that is credible?

4,Sonia's attention drawn to civic election fiasco,"PUNE: Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee vicepresident Anant Gadgil has demanded that party president Sonia Gandhi take serious cognisance of the Congress' defeat in a recent municipal by-election. Speaking to reporters here on Thursday, Gadgil pointed out that the Congress had entered into a pact with the Nationalist Congress party (NCP) while contesting the by-election in the Rasta Peth Power House panel. Yet, Congress candidate Kaku Gavhane was pushed to the third place. This is shocking and should be considered as a warning for the party, which will soon face assembly and Lok Sabha polls in the state, he said, urging Gandhi to change the party's structure in the city.

5,Money fuels transfers in income-tax and customs,"NEW DELHI: The arrest of deputy commissioner (income-tax) Anurag Vardhan by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Thursday, for allegedly paying a bribe to a minister's personal assistant for a more lucrative post in Mumbai, has once again proved that the transfer and posting policies followed by both the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) and Central Board Excise and Customs (CBEC) is flawed. CBI sources said that over the past one year, raids have been carried out on about 100 income-tax and customs officials. ''Money begets money in both these services. Officials make money and then bribe their seniors, politicians or dalals who move freely in the North Block for a more lucrative posting. Vardhan was caught paying Rs four lakh because he was in the income-tax department. Had he been in customs, he would have been caught paying more,'' said a source. Anurag Vardhan's colleague from the 1994 batch told The Times of India that he was a ''simple and fairly honest'' officer when he began his career. ''Anurag's father and father-in-law both were IAS officers in Bihar. He did geography (honours) from Patna university and married a girl from another caste against the wishes of his parents, without taking any dowry. He changed after his posting to Chennai and nine years later has landed himself in CBI custody,'' said a bureaucrat friend of his. A senior official in the CBI said, ''We lay traps for all corrupt officials. But the raids on former customs chief B P Verma, other customs officials, and also on the I-T officials shows that we are getting maximum information about corruption from these services.'' A source in the CBDT said all the raids conducted by the CBI on the IRS officials recently has sent a clear message that both the services need cleaning up. ''Both the income-tax and the customs officials have a lot of public dealing to do and hence some of the officials start abusing their power and take bribes. Even the government is suffering a huge revenue loss due to these corrupt officials,'' said a source.

6,Another top I-T official arrested by CBI,"NEW DELHI: The arrest of a personal assistant to the minister of state for finance and a deputy commissioner of income-tax on Thursday night seems to have opened a Pandora's box for the department. The CBI on Friday conducted raids on the premises of another income-tax official C M Naik, an assistant commissioner. While moving an application seeking custody of Perumalswamy, personal assistant to the minister of state for finance, and Anurag Vardhan, the tainted income-tax deputy commissioner, the CBI said they were awaiting results of the raids at Naik's house. The agency also claimed that more income-tax officials may be involved in the scam. ''The accused need to be interrogated to unearth involvement of other persons in this racket,'' CBI said. Vardhan, meanwhile, claimed he had sought his transfer to Mumbai for his children who are reportedly suffering from Autism. Even in his transfer performa Vardhan claimed that his three-and-half year old son is suffering from Prevasive Developmental Disorder and has speaking problem. Vardhan further said that his son is getting treatment from a Mumbai-based hospital and there has been considerable improvement in his health. ''My wife and myself have to visit Mumbai every three weeks which is difficult physically as well as financially,'' Vardhan stated in his transfer performa. Vardhan's advocate Dinesh Mathur denied the allegations. While opposing CBI's application seeking Vardhan's custody, Mathur submitted his client's children had not had food since Thursday night. ''Only their father can help them eat,'' Mathur said. Perumalswamy, who allegedly accepted money from Vardhan to facilitate his transfer to Mumbai, too denied the allegations. Additional sessions judge Prem Kumar, however, remanded both to CBI custody. While the CBI had sought 10 days' custody for both, the judge remanded Vardhan for four days. Perumalswamy was remanded for 10 days.

8,Game of one-upmanship,"LUCKNOW: The rechristening of Amethi as Chhatrapati Shahuji Maharaj Nagar, an independent district finally, on Friday has once again brought into focus the guerrilla war going on between the Congress and BSP to retain their hold over the Dalit vote bank in Sonia's parliamentary constituency. While the CM leaves for foreign shores after having shown her might to the political rivals, irate Congressmen in a retaliatory mood now plan pitching in Amethi's Dalit in a direct confrontation with the authorities. Already the party has launched an agitation against the highhandedness of the CM and the disrespect shown to Rajiv by renaming. And in a clever move, the movement proposes to showcase the local Dalit power to reiterate the point that Dalit ki beti cannot upstage the 'Gandhi bahu' by mere stroke of a pen, say Congress sources. After a brief lull, things began to hot up between the two parties once again last week. During her visit, Sonia pressed upon the need to woo back Dalit into Congress's fold. Addressing local party workers, she exhorted them to go to Dalit pockets and mingle with them and even hold chaupals in Dalit mohallas to solve their disputes in order to win their confidence. Sonia also visited three villages in Amethi which were gutted in a recent fire. Taking the clue, the youth Congress workers, in a well calculated strategy, took it upon themselves to adopt the Gajanpur village, the worst ravaged and rebuild the houses as out of 107 houses destroyed, 82 belonged to Dalits. Earlier, in Punnpur incident also, Congress had walked away with the limelight. Priyanka Gandhi played the role of Dalit messiah to the hilt by walking into the police station to lodge a complaint on behalf of Ram Bhajan. The promptness with which DM and SP have been posted to CSM Nagar, which hardly has any offices to house them, has once again shown, she would not bear with any poaching on her territory. With an eye on parliamentary polls, Maya has killed two birds with one stone. While she has stolen the thunder from Congress's Dalit, come back strategy by renaming the district, by ignoring Sanjay Singh, the BJP leader who wanted Amethi to be named after his father late Raja Rananjay Singh, she has shown, who the actual ruler was.

The police had earlier obtained a warrant of arrest against the MLA. The police team, led by Z Ahmad, Vaishali Sadar DSP, reached the MLA's residence around 10.30 pm. Pandey was reportedly waiting for the police team to arrive and didn't offer any resistance. The team later took Pandey to Hajipur. The criminals, arrested by the Patna police in Dr Ramesh Chandra kidnapping case, had made sensational disclosure about the role of Pandey in receiving a huge ransom for the release of Dr Sinha. The Patna police also lodged a case against Pandey under the Arms Act on Friday. The MLA is charged with opening fire on the premises of a posh hotel located near Gandhi Maidan on May 17. Police believe that the Samata MLA opened fire in order to ""celebrate"" Dr Ramesh Chandra's kidnapping after receiving a message from the abductors in the hotel while attending a party. Notorious criminal Bablu, an accused in the Chandra kidnapping case, had disclosed the patronage extended by the MLA to his gang, besides MLA's involvement in Hajipur-based Dr G M Sinha kidnapping case, at the press conference held by the Senior SP following the recovery of Dr Ramesh Chandra.

11,No threat to Mayawati government,"LUCKNOW: Late evening resignation of agriculture minister Ajit Singh from the Union cabinet set off speculations about the withdrawl of his 14 Rashtriya Loktantrik Dal (RLD) MLAs from the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) - Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) coalition. But even as the political pundits sat down with their calculators, there's hardly a reason why chief minister Mayawati should be worried. Her coalition is set for a smooth sail despite the political storm. The UP Vidhan Sabha comprises 402 elected members with Chiraigaon seat awaiting bypoll. The break-up includes—- Samajwadi Party 142, BSP 110, BJP 87, excluding Rajnath Singh, Indian National Congress 16, after the split which saw seven of its MLAs joining the BSP with the exception of Akhilesh Singh who is on the run. This apart, 14 MLAs of RLD, 4 of RKP, two each of CPI-M and UP Loktantrik Congress (UPLC). They are followed by one each of Apna Dal, JD U, Akhil Bhartiya Congress Dal (ABCD), Majhi Majhwar Shoshit Samaj (MMSS), SJP (Nationalist), Janata Party, Samata Party, Hindu Mahasabha (HM) and the National Loktantrik Party (NLP). Besides, there are 16 independent MLAs. Together they take the tally to 402. The BSPs 110 and 87 of the BJP add up to 192. With the two MLAs of UPLC and one each of Akhil Bhartiya Congress Dal (assuming Akhilesh's support is accepted), MMSS, Samata Party, Hindu Mahasabha and 10 of the 16independent MLAs the total comes to a safe 213. Meanwhile reacting to Ajit Singh's resignation, the RKP chief Kalyan Singh said that the doors of his party were always open to for the RLD chief who has no option but to withdraw support to the UP government. Rejecting projections of a safe majority, Kalyan urged the governor to ask Mayawati to prove her majority on the floor of the house. Dismissing speculations of threat to the Mayawati government, Urban Development Minister Lalji Tandon said that the government would remain firmly in saddle even if Ajit Singh does decide to pull out of the coalition.

12,Are govt literacy figures correct?,"BANGALORE: Around 35 per cent of children studying in classes IV and V are unable to write, even though the literacy rate shown by the government is 65 per cent. Dileep Ranjekar of the Azim Premji Foundation voiced this during his presentation on Innovative approaches to education'' at a session on civil society initiatives and public-private partnerships. This was part of the Annual Bank Conference on Development Economics. Figures have shown that of the 100 students admitted to class I, only 42 reach class VIII, and only 16 % of them come up to X standard. In the coming 10 years, the government will have to spend $25 billion towards universalisation of elementary education. Innovation is an absolute necessity where the problem is mammoth,'' he said. Samuel Paul of the Public Affairs Centre spoke on Giving citizens voice: the experience of PAC'', while Kalpana Kar of BATF shared the experience of interacting with government to see several projects through over the last three years.

13,Building reconstruction rules are violated: Mhada,"MUMBAI: For the first time ever, the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (Mhada) has admitted to gross violations of rules by builders as well as its own officers in cases pertaining to the reconstruction of old buildings in the island city. There are about 19,000 such properties mainly located in south Mumbai. But several buildings, which were apparently in excellent condition, were also allowed to be demolished by Mhada to make way for high-rises, sources said. The admission comes in the wake of allegations that some builders redeveloping old buildings unscrupulously inflate the number of tenants so that they get additional floor space index (FSI), the ratio which determines how tall buildings can be constructed. Under the law, the higher the number of tenants to be rehoused by the developer free of cost, the more FSI he gets to construct the building which he can sell in the open market to make profits. In a circular issued last week, Mhada chief U.P.S. Madan warned his staff to ensure that tenants,who are in actual occupation of the premises, are the same whose names appear in the proposal of the developer. Complaints have been received in certain cases where rehabilitation flats constructed by the builder are not allotted to some of the existing tenants. To ensure allotment of flats to the rightful owner, it is necessary that the builder hands over the new building to the repair board,which can then allot the flats to these tenants,'' the circular said. Sources said the most glaring case was that of the 38-storey Suraj Apartments at Breach Candy, constructed on a property which once housed an old bungalow. The architect of this skyscraper, Hafeez Contractor, showed himself and his mother as tenants of the dilapidated structure so that they could get a free flat in the new building. It was found that they had never lived on the premises. In a recent case, housing minister Syed Ahmed issued a stay against the redevelopment of a cessed property called Govind Niwas at Altamount Road after some local residents complained that the builder had exaggerated the number of tenants living on that property. The complainants claimed that there were only two tenants living in Govind Niwas, but the developer had produced a list of 32 tenants in order to get more FSI during reconstruction. The developer has denied this allegation. There is also a controversy surrounding the construction of India's tallest building at Nana Chowk, the 45-storeyed Shreepati Arcade. This tower was built on a property which housed the Hari Niwas chawl. Mhada sources said that although there were 370 tenants living in Hari Niwas, the builder constructed only 137 flats in the rehabilitation component of the project. The developer, on the other hand, claimed that the remaining tenants were rehoused in the tower. Sources debunked this claim, stating that this could not be possible considering that each flat in the tower was being sold for over Rs 12,000 per sq ft. A number of cases have been brought to my notice where no-objection certificates (NOC) have been given to the developers without following the due process or in violation of the existing rules,'' Mr Madan's circular said. It appears that there is a need to review the system of such cases considering the complaints received by us in such matters in the past,'' it observed.

17,Counselling cells to prevent suicide,"AHMEDABAD/VADODARA: Poor HSC science results, that led to a student committing suicide in Vadodara and many getting into a state of depression, has led the state government to put in place a massive counselling service for students in as many as 11 centres in Gujarat and utilise the service of 30 ""specialists."" Results of the HSC general stream examination are awaited in the first week of June while SSC results are expected by the second week of June. Each of these centres, set up by the state health department, will have a helpline telephone number where students will be counselled to help them get over the fear of failing or getting low marks or if they are depressed after the results are announced. The Gujarat State Education Board (GSEB) is also gearing up to tackle the problem. ""We have drawn up a plan to motivate teachers and principals of affiliated schools to provide academic counselling to students and parents on career options open to them despite poor results,"" says GSEB director PV Trivedi. The 11 centres will soon be functional in Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara, Jamnagar, Rajkot, Himmatnagar, Palanpur, Patan, Anand, Navsari and Nadiad where local psychiatrists, psychologists and counsellors have been identified to help students. In Ahmedabad, state health secretary S K Nanda convened a meeting of citybased psychiatrists to formulate a long term plan to sustain the helpline centres and introduce a lecture series for parents. In Ahmedabad, the health department has invited psychiatrists Mrugesh Vaishnav, Hitendra Gandhi, Hansal Bhachech and Vinod Goyal to handle the calls that would be received at the helpine numbers here. ""The poor HSC science result has disturbed many students this year. Through these cells we would help students and parents by providing counselling. There is a need to make students and parents understand that one exam does not mean the end of life and students should realise that they have options in life,"" says Vaishnav. According to him, the helpline centres are a part of a long-term plan to continue such service throughout the year for students. ""We have also organised a special lecture series in some cities. In Ahmedabad, we have planned a talk on this issue on May 26 at the Ahmedabad Management Association,"" said Vaishnav. In Vadodara, consulting psychiatrists Gautam Amin and Sandip Shah will work with specialists from the Mental Hospital and SSG Hospital to run the cell. ""This is an initiative to intervene in impulsive suicides. In most cases, students decide to commit suicide in the heat of the moment. Often, they are not cases of prolonged depression. The children take such decisions quickly when certain thoughts come to their mind after a bad result,"" he said. HELPLINE NUMBERS Ahmedabad: 9825767565, 9825066769, 9826050227 Vadodara: 9824060683, 9825046976 Surat: 9825142406, 9824136937.
