''if elected for another term of five years the government will be able to complete the on-going projects in the state,'' he added. the fm said that the economy of the state had been made to stand on its feet, thanks to proper management, adoption of austerity measures and mobilisation of resources. he added that substantial funds had been provided for the development projects and implementation of welfare schemes. as per the comprehensive plan of the government, rs 4,400 crore are being spent on the widening and strengthening of main roads, construction of bridges, hospitals, among others, he added. at least rs 725 crore are being spent on road works. cheques, amounting to rs 5 crore, were also distributed among panchayats of 192 villages and two municipal councils of amloh constituency. kanwaljit singh said that the congress and other parties, who know they will loose the upcoming elections, do not have a concrete election program, which is why they are levelling false charges. criticising the panthic morcha, he said that they morcha was in cahoots with the congress party, hoping to harm the sad-bjp government. commenting on the congress' anti-punjab policies, the fm said the congress had ruined the state's economy. later, kanwaljit inaugurated a computer training centre, set up by the panchyat of bhambri, at a cost of rs 18.75 lakh. here, 30 students will be trained in three different courses of the punjab technical university.

2,Modi bans political transfers,"gandhinagar: the narendra modi government has decided to tighten the groove over haphazard transfer of senior officials and government employees under political recommendations. putting a virtual ban on transfers with recommendations from ministers or any other influential person, a government resolution issued by the state's powerful general administration department, working directly under the cm, says, ""such a recommendation should obligatorily be attached with the application of the person stating his or her desire to be transferred"". the resolution, trf-102001-1528-g.2, regrets that a gr issued on october 25, 2000, stating it would be necessary to follow a set procedure for the transfers based on recommendations, is not being implemented in letter and spirit even after a year. ""if the official's consent for transfer is not obtained by the minister, the mla or the mp, then the recommendation will not be entertained"", it states. officially okayed a month ago, the gr was circulated only last week. aimed at 'better management and administration of personnel', the gad gr is directly related with modi's view that transfers in the secretariat had become a big business and there ought to be some way to stop it. the cm, a few days after he took over the reins on october 7, had told a secretaries' meeting that ministers should learn to say 'no' to political pressures on transfers, pointing out, the bureaucrats in return must learn to say 'yes' while quickly moving files.

3,BJP preparing for joint session on terror law,"new delhi: even as a section of the bjp appears to be having second thoughts on ramming the controversial prevention of terrorism ordinance through if it fails in the rajya sabha, the government is making preparations for a joint session, either on december 22 or 24, in the central hall of parliament. it will be presided over by the lok sabha speaker. highly placed sources added that if the opposition agreed, it could be even held between december 19 and 21, by cancelling business on a regular day of the session. in fact, mps have been told that they may have to remain in town till december 24 even though the winter session officially ends on december 21. highly placed sources said while all indications are that the joint session will be held, the final decision will be that of the prime minister on december 18, the day poto will come up for voting in the rajya sabha. the anti-terror law is slated for introduction in the lok sabha on tuesday â€” the discussion and voting in the house will be on wednesday. bjp sources indicated that a section of its uttar pradesh unit feels that if poto fails in the rajya sabha, the party could then use it effectively as an election issue by portraying the opposition as anti-national. if it gets it passed through a joint session, the campaign will lose its edge, this section feels, sources added. the official line from party spokesperson v k malhotra at his daily briefing was that the party felt that it was ''in the national interest that this legislation was approved by parliament''.attacking the congress for opposing poto, he said:''it seems the congress has not learnt lessons from history on how if the nation is not united, it falls a prey to external threats.'' senior official sources said the government was of the view that if the bill is being taken to the rajya sabha despite certain defeat, despite the amendments that have been introduced in it, it might as well hold a joint session and ensure its passage. technically, the ordinance can be revalidated, but the government is not in favour of exercising this option foreseeing severe opposition criticism, especially if it follows defeat in the rajya sabha. with the backing of the aiadmk, which has a strength of 17 mps in both houses, and the ncp which has nine mps, the government expects the support of 433 of the 782 members of both houses. those opposing poto add up to to only 349. the constitution permits a joint sitting of both houses if a bill, passed by one house, is rejected by the other house or if the houses disagree on amendments to be made in the bill. a joint session has been held only twice before, once to pass the dowry prohibition bill, 1959, and then for the banking service commission (repeal) bill, 1977.

4,Cong iftar party guest list a sign of things to come,"new delhi: if the guest list for iftar parties is an indicator of relations between political parties, then congress president sonia gandhi's iftar on tuesday is a keen pointer to the changing political alignments in delhi. while sp leaders mulayam singh yadav and amar singh figure prominently on the list, ncp leader sharad pawar, trinamul congress chief mamata bannerjee and the aiadmk, although technically still a congress ally, are not among the invitees. the inclusion of the sp leaders to the congress iftar at the party's headquarters on akbar road is on expected lines. ever since cpm leader somnath chatterjee's famous dinner for opposition leaders, relations between the congress and the sp have been on the mend with leaders from both sides shedding their old animosity towards each other. this was evident when sonia attended the iftar hosted at yadav's residence and the latter reciprocated further by greeting the congress president on her birthday on sunday. the reasons for ignoring pawar, mamata and the aiadmk are not far to seek. although technically the congress still has an alliance with the aiadmk in tamil nadu, relations between the two have been steadily going downhill with the aiadmk cosying up to the nda. the two parties have been battling it out in pondicherry, they also did not have an alliance in the recent local elections. pawar, who was also invited for chatterjee's ''unity dinner'', was originally very much on the iftar list, especially after sonia was invited for the ncp leader's birthday celebrations in mumbai on december 12. but pawar's subsequent statement that he had not invited sonia and that his objections to her foreign origins still remain valid, ended up with sonia politely declining the invitation to his birthday party and not inviting him for her iftar. similarly, relations between the trinamul and the congress have also soured after the west bengal assembly elections. the same time last year, the congress had been assiduously wooing mamata who was the cynosure of all eyes at its iftar then. her presence had sent out a signal that the two would have a poll pact. the alliance did materialise but after the poor showing in the west bengal elections, the two again drifted apart with mamata having rejoined the nda. others who figure in the congress guest list include leaders of left parties â€” harkishan singh surjeet, somnath chatterjee and a.b. bardhan. among the nda allies, coal and mines minister ram vilas paswan, labour minister sharad yadav and jammu and kashmir chief minister farooq abdullah have been invited. senior congress leaders explained that since the iftar was being hosted by sonia in her capacity as the congress president and not as the leader of the opposition and was being held at the party's headquarters, the guest list did not include the prime minister or the home minister. ''after all, you cannot expect the pm to come to the congress party office,'' said a senior leader.

5,I D Swami slugs it out for Advani over terror law,"new delhi: the much-awaited clash between union home minister l k advani and national human rights commission chairman justice j s verma over the government's controversial new terror law did not materialise at the human rights day function here on monday. however, two ministers of state â€” i d swami of home affairs and ravishankar prasad of coal and mines â€” stood in for advani arguing against verma's position that poto is violative of human rights. the two ministers said human rights are ''laudable objectives'' but one cannot forget the reality that ''terrorists are bent upon destroying the rule of law, violating the basic human rights of common citizens'' and reducing them to ''victims of terror''. justice verma earlier said: ''some people these days denounce human rights. they feel encouraged to use the term 'human rights wallahs' to describe human rights (hrs). i consider this a pejorative term.'' he added: ''i didn't want to say anything about any legislation. but one thing i would like to say is that tolerance is essential to human rights; tolerance of a point of view you don't like. i am disturbed to a degree by such utterances,'' referring to poto, justice verma said ''whatever decision is finally taken, everybody will abide by it. but in the decision-making procedure, we must not shut our eyes to things.'' swami pointed out how the uk and the us had passed anti-terrorist legislation without much murmur. he said:''in the us it took three days to pass the law. on the first day, the house of representatives passed it. second day, the senate passed the law and the third day president bush put his seal on it. and here we are still faced with how to pass the law .'' referring to verma's caution that governments have to do a ''fine balancing act between maintaining peace and security and human rights,'' swami said, ''this balancing, this tightrope-walking cannot be done always''. he added that ''since the right to life had been destroyed by terrorists, there is a need to create such a law to meet this extraordinary situation.'' he also claimed the government had information that some human rights organisations had links with terrorists and were being funded by them. however, he did not name these organisations. verma, on the other hand, asserted that ''human rights were no hindrance to peace and security.'' he also argued that ''individual liberty and national security exist together. they are not inconsistent''.

6,Anti-VHP rally turns violent,"rajkot: a silent rally taken out by members of the muslim community here to protest against the utterances of vishwa hindu parishad leader pravin togadia turned violent on monday. a section of the rallyists threw stones, overturned groundnut oil tins and hurled foodgrain sacks on to the street in the danapith area, where tension prevailed after the violence. members of the rally submitted a memorandum to resident deputy collector and police commissioner sudhir sinha, demanding action against togadia. while they were closeted with sinha, a small group left the rally and went on the rampage. they forced traders of the danapith area to put up the shutters. the rally was taken out by the saurashtra muslim seva mandal and the husseini sena. according to eyewitnesses, the mob first attacked the shop of n. jayantilal and flung groundnut oil tins on to the road. its members then moved ahead and targeted shops belonging to jayantilal panachand, champak thakkar and other foodgrain merchants. sacks of grains soon found their way to the road. the sudden attack by the rallyists stunned the traders. they later complained to 'the times of india' that the police were late in coming to their rescue. however, not a single complaint has been filed so far against any group. the traders have decided to meet the police commissioner and seek protection to prevent a repetition of such incidents in future, a spokesman of the rajkot chamber of commerce said. earlier, the rally which began from ramnathpara chowk, passed through the main thoroughfares of the city before reaching the collectorate. muslim leaders alleged that togadia, while addressing a public meeting at karanpara chowk, had used derogatory terms against 'the koran'. they said that the vhp leader had tried to breach communal peace in rajkot. muslims from all over the region joined the rally. they demanded that togadia be barred from entering rajkot. meanwhile, the collector's office has decided to send a detailed report to the state home department. the collector has also procured a video cassette of togadia's speech at karanpara and also of monday's violent incidents. in another development, hindu organisations of the city submitted a letter bearing 10,000 signatures to resident district collector h m patel, to be forwarded to president narayanan, demanding measures to ensure the safety of hindus in bangladesh.

7,Tirupati gears up for municipal elections,"tirupati: the political scene in the pilgrim town of tirupati remains surcharged as after a decade the municipal elections are to be held in february, 2002. the telugu desam and the congress are vying with eachother to get hold of the municipality. the district administration has already notified the reservation of wards, leaving the municipal chairmanship to the general category. never before has the town witnessed such feverish activity during elections as it has this time. a lot is at stake not only for the contesting parties who have been promising the moon but also for the civic-conscious citizens, who have been fed up with the deteriorating state of civic amenities provided by the tirupati municipality. while lord venkateswara has put tirupati on the global map, the infrastructure facilities still remain inadequate. in spite of laying of underground drainage system, the drains get clogged after every rain, mosquitoes plague in many areas, garbage clearance work is unsatisfactory, hawkers have literally taken over the footpaths, street lights are inadequate and traffic is chaotic. with a population of around 2.5 lakh and a daily floating population of fifty thousand, the municipality nets an annual income of about rs 40 crore. the situation has assumed further significance as the tdp supremo and chief minister n chandrababu naidu hails from chittoor district besides being a student leader in tirupati in the seventies. the main fight will be between the ruling td and congress, while the presence of the bharatiya janata party and the leftist parties is of not much significance. the ruling telugu desam party is leaving no stone unturned to capture the prestigious tirupati municipality in the hometurf of ap chief minister. the td thus has an edge over its rivals and most of the votes for the party will be because of naidu. however, the td faces very strong internal squabbles. the td, in spite of its strong influence, is badly mauled by groupism.whenever naidu visits the pilgrim town, all the groups force themselves to come under one umbrella but dissipate immediately after his departure to the capital. however, the strongman from the eastern parts and lone minister from the district, bojjala gopalakrishna reddy, is expected to work out atleast a temporary deal among the warring groups. the name largely heard in the ensuing contest is that of shankar reddy, who is said to be unwilling to contest but is being pressurised by the chief minister. the congress has a sizeable number of sympathisers in the town and is hoping that the goodwill translates into votes. one prominent youngster who zealously aspires for the municipal chairmanship is mabbudevanarayana reddy, son of former tirupati mla mabbu rami reddy of the congress. another youth congress leader mallikarjun also staked his claim for the position.

9,Cheated investors turn violent,"kolkata: more than 20 people including six police personnel were injured in a pitched battle between depositors of furore housing and investment (india) limited â€” a non-banking financial company now under police investigation for its alleged involvement in the multi-crore scam â€” and the police. amid public outrage and heavy brickbatting, the police made a lathi charge and burst four tear-gas shells. the trouble started when about 500 depositors, including 300 women, were prevented by the police from marching towards the residence of chief minister buddhadeb bhattacharjee at palm avenue demanding government intervention to get their money back. personnel from the karaya police station had raided the company's office near park circus and sealed it. the owner of the company absconded and remains untraced till now. when we went to the karaya police station the day the office was sealed, the officers said that they would manage to return some of our investment by december 10, said elderly raushana ara, a depositor injured in the clash. but when they went to the police station on monday, police said they had no authority to return the money unless directed by the court. we then decided to go and meet the chief minister for redress, said zahida khatoon, another depositor. detective department sources said that furore had offices in three districts howrah, where it owned over 500 acres of land at amta and television and fan factories. it also owned three hotels in digha, puri and darjeeling. the total funds misappropriated by the company in kolkata is estimated to be rs 6 crore. the police blocked our way and tried chase us away. they made an unprovoked lathi charge and injured some of us, a victim said. to deputy commissioner (south) kuldip singh though, the allegation appeared highly exaggerated. he said, when they were approaching from broad street to palm avenue, we tried to persuade them but they turned violent. the depositors blocked the crossing of new park street and darga road for over 45 minutes. soon, the crossing turned into a battlefield. local people came to the aid of the depositors. anything strewn over the places was used as a missile to attack the police. the vehicle of assistant commissioner (v) was damaged. a bus would have been set ablaze, had not the fire-brigade intervened in time.

10,Mayawati to oppose even amended terror law,"lucknow: the bahujan samaj party vice-president mayawati on monday vowed to oppose poto in parliament even if it was amended to suit the demands of the opposition. poto, she said, was created to pusha wedge between different communities and then reap its consequences at the polls. talking to reporters, the bsp vice-president said that home minister advani himself had admitted that the purpose for which poto was created had been achieved. this itself showed that the purpose of the ordinance was not to stop terrorism in its tracks but reap benefits at poll time, said the former chief minister. mayawati said if the intention of the government was to check terrorism, it could have brought this ordinance when jammu and kashmir and some north eastern states were in the grip of extremist forces. but the government, she said, chose to bring it when it saw that the going for the bjp would be tough in the assembly polls of uttar pradesh, uttaranchal and punjab. these states are scheduled to go for polls simultaneously. with the help of poto and ram temple, she said, the bjp would try to divert the attention of the people from glaring failures of the government. this was the reason that now the bjp has promised to people to solve the ayodhya tangle by march 12, said mayawati. however, she said that organising the december 15 rally at lucknow, the bsp would expose government's failure. the rally, she said, would also demonstrate bsp's strength. the bsp vice-president also ridiculed the chief minister for his pledge to wedge a war against criminals and crime. if the chief minister really wished to weed out criminals from uttar pradesh, mayawati said, he could begin it by removing criminal elements from his council of ministers. there are 20 to 22 ministers with criminal links, alleged mayawati. on likely poll tie-ups, she said her party was sure to perform well at the election. in hindsight, she said, the bsp could have won 175 seats in 1996 assembly polls if it had fought the poll alone. she said the bsp's alliance with the congress did not help bsp in any way. the upper caste voters, which were aligned with the congress, did not cast their lot with bsp candidates, she said. terming that alliance a mistake, mayawati said thereafter the bsp decided to forge alliances with the dalit samaj by bringing them under one umbrella. also, the bsp would prefer those upper castes who had come out of the manuvadi fold, said mayawati. she declined to comment on the perceived closeness of samajwadi party and congress and said, let them confirm it first. she said samajwadi party was rattled by internal dissensions of the worst kind. even yadavs were leaving sp, she said.

11,CM hosts roza iftar party with aplomb,"lucknow: chief minister rajnath singh on monday looked one among several maulanas and hajis, who came to his 5, kalidas marg residence here for a roza iftar party. this was the first such party hosted by a political leader during this ramzan. little wonder then that the party was a big draw, in fact the biggest in the recent past. singh was dressed for the occasion. he had a typical black cap called 'dupalli' on and a green 'dupatta' (scarf) around his neck. the cm sat through all the rituals. the namaz was offered by mohamad hamidul hasan. although muslim leaders of all hues and shades were present there, leaders from the opposition party were conspicuous by their absence. the lone non-bjp leader was senior congress leader ammar rizvi. but then the cm prompt enough to describe it as a 'non-political' event. we should not see politics in everything, he said adding, let good things prevail. when asked whether the good turnout of muslims to his party was an indication of his popularity among the minorities, he said: i can't say so, but i am confident that they have no reason to be annoyed with me. roza iftar party was a good beginning, he said. this happened to be the first roza iftar party by the bjp leadership after ram prakash gupta discontinued the practice during his tenure as chief minister. gupta, however, was present all through the party on monday. those present on the occasion included mohamad hamidul hasan, maulana agharuhi, mohamad mumtaz, syed rafat, retired justice syed haider abbas raza, prof sabira habib, ma tahir, mohamad usman, syed mohamad matim, jamir ahamad sajjadnasin, kasim baba of dilkusha mazar.

12,North Gujarat gears up for panchayat polls,"palanpur: the announcement of the panchayat poll schedule has to an extent heightened political activity in north gujarat. hectic lobbying for their candidates has begun in the villages. the gram panchayat poll does not have a direct impact on the taluka and district panchayat elections scheduled for february. meanwhile, the last position after withdrawal of the input on thursday) the last date for withdrawal) 162 gram panchayat (23.30) per cent have been declared as samras (unopposed). according to figure supplied by the district election office, in bnaskantha of the 8812 nominations received for 664 now, 8650 candidates remained in the fray for 502 gram sarpanch post while 12453 nominations inputs have been recorded for 5279 seats in 665 village panchayats. candidates, despite their loyalties and persuasion and affiliations, join the fray in individual capacity without a party symbol. yet everyone is trying to ensure the victory of their nominee. ""this will indirectly help us in the taluka and district panchayats"", said bjp mla magansinh vaghela. interestingly, hectic activity in the bjp is discernible compared to the rival camp, congress, which is yet to shake off its inertia. bjp-backed candidates have opened election office, too. with chief minister narendra modi's whirlwind tour of banaskantha, mehsana and patan districts in the last week, the election tempo has gathered momentum and gave a shot in the arm to the party workers. congress leaders, including mp madhusudan mistry, vice president daulat parmar, general secretary govabhai desai, held a party workers' meeting to boost their morale. the panchayat election in the district could not take place last time due to reorganisation of the district. besides 662 of the 665 panchayats in banaskantha, 477 in sabarkantha, 150 in mehsana and 193 in patan will have polling on december 23. the silver lining, though, is that about 70 gram panchayats could be declared samras (unopposed). according to the latest figure supplied by the district election office, in banaskantha 8,812 nomination forms have been filed for 664 positions of gram panchayat while 13,453 nominations inputs have been recorded for 5279 seats of wards. the nomination filed so far show a tough fight ahead. bjp mla magansinh vaghela from kankrej has, however, hoped some 20 gram panchayats in his area would endorse samras. as usual, the caste factor is crucial. ajana and thakore communities which account for 39 per cent of voters have been considered the deciding factor. other segments include scheduled castes and scheduled tribes, muslims, kshatriyas and other minor communities.

13,Police messed up Atharâ€™s arrest,"lucknow: a palpable silence has descended the katra beejan beg pocket of saadatganj since monday morning after newspapers carried reports of a local lad atharuddin being charge-sheeted in the red fort shootout carried out by two members of lashkar-e-taiba. the non-descript house of atharuddin, which he left in january last and was missing since, is now occupied by his three brothers who remained elusive. the neighbours too did not have much to offer. woh ghar par naheen hain (they are not at home) was the reply to all the queries they faced on monday. on sunday, the delhi police submitted a supplementary charge-sheet in which atharuddin also figures among the 11 accused named in the december 22 attack in which two armymen and a civilian were killed. the first and main charge-sheet in the case had been filed in february. after atharuddin's name figured in the investigations, a team from delhi police reached lucknow on january 12, this year. without a specific strategy to arrest atharuddin, the team swooped down on his house and tried to pick him up but the locals foiled the attempt as the police team was in mufti. the locals were then reacting to rumours that the men had come to kidnap atharuddin who was returning from a mosque in chowk area after offering the afternoon prayers. the police team had to hurriedly leave the place fearing that the mob might turn violent. after that atharuddin went untraceable. i don't know anything .... he has not been seen in the locality since that day, said a local shopkeeper. people, however, were sceptical about his involvement in the shootout. pata naheen kya sach hai, (we don't know what is the truth) said a local who knew atharuddin's family closely. after the death of his father ahmaduddin and mother, atharuddin, the youngest among four brothers, gave up studies when he failed in class viii at shia college in 1983-84. his three older brothers mazharuddin, azharuddin and asaruddin took up the work of the embroidery factory which their father owned at akbari gate, while atharuddin began to work at a shop in hazratganj dealing in repairs of refrigerators. three years later, he gave up the job and tried his hand at making jewellry. in 1996, atharuddin went to jeddah in search of work and returned to lucknow in 2000. he is now believed to be in jeddah.

14,Ministers ignore chief ministerâ€™s plea,"lucknow: why is om prakash singh, a senior minister of the rajnath singh government, holding important portfolios like irrigation, pwd and higher education, delaying giving his consent for donating his salary to the chief minister's relief fund? a couple of days ago when this correspondent wanted to know the answer from the minister he said he would neither confirm nor deny it. some of the other ministers whose name figured in the list of those who have not yet given their consent for depositing their salary to the cm's relief fund also refused to talk on this topic. at the bjp yuva morcha's convention at agra, the chief minister had announced that his ministers would donate their one-month salary into the chief minister's relief fund. the other leaders of the party had also echoed similar sentiments saying that this would be done by october 29. obviously, this announcement was made by the chief minister to blunt the criticism that the bjp was retaining power beyond its designated five-year term which was coming to an end on october 17. thus, the chief minister's missive would have taken the wind out of opposition's sail, said a bjp leader. but the ministers drawn from allies did not seem to be showing any enthusiasm in falling in the line suggested by rajnath singh, though the matter was sent to them (ministers) for their approval. interestingly, all the ministers had concurred earlier with the suggestion, said an official of the chief minister's secretariat. some of the ministers who had not donated their salary till the last week also included the high-profile minister om prakash singh and other ministers such as radheyshyam kori, rakesh tyagi, both from the lok janshakti party headed by coal minister ram vilas paswan. incidentally, the state chief of the lcp, who is a minister in the rajnath government, also figured in the list. minister of state from the loktantrik congress party, virendra singh, too, has not sent any letter for donating his salary till now. then there are bans naraian patel from kmbsp and an independent minister jitendra kumar jaiswal who have not complied with the suggestions made by the chief minister. not only that, some of the consent of some of senior ministers from bjp like premlata katiyar reached the concerned office a couple of days ago, said an official.

16,Business as usual in Nagpur despite bandh,"nagpur: although it was a day for bandh calls and rasta rokos in nagpur, it was business as usual for the state legislature on monday. the vidarbha bandh was called by the vidarbha rajya sangharsha kriti samiti, but it did not affect normal life in nagpur and the region. however, the call for rasta roko by the shiv sena-bjp alliance ``to highlight grievances of the farmers'' evoked a mixed response, with former chief minister narayan rane and former deputy chief minister gopinath munde courting arrest outside nagpur. former deputy chief minister nasikrao tirpude, who has been leading the agitation for a separate state, was briefly detained near the gandhi statue in the itwari area in presence of a handful of his supporters. but in maharashtra's second capital, the agitation which has obviously been lacking in popular support failed to create a ripple. the rasta roko was largely peaceful, except for an incident wherein about a hundred sena workers detained the vidarbha express train for around two hours at anjangaon. the group, led by sena worker anil bonde, pulled the train's alarm chain as it left amaravati station. the police lathi-charged the onlookers, according to eyewitness reports. mr rane and mr munde staged the rasta roko at khapri naka at wardha road on monday morning. the agitation, despite due notice, took the police by surprise. the queue of vehicles detained in both directions was several kilometres long. nearly 30 legislators accompanied the two leaders, who were taken in a bus to the butibori police station before being released. sena mp subodh mohite led agitators at ramtek, where governor p.c. alexandar was scheduled to attend a function. however, there was no disruption. the rasta roko took place at over 100 places in the region. addressing a press conference at vidhan bhavan in the afternoon, mr rane said the democratic front (df) government had failed to dispense justice to farmers. refusal to pay the full amount against cotton procurement, load-shedding in all parts of maharashtra, increasing water supply tariffs and refusal to purchase blackened jowar were among the main issues on which the government had deprived farmers of any future, he said. ``the rasta roko had sought to highlight this cavalier attitude of the government,'' he added. he alleged that the government was trying to wind up the ongoing winter session in a hurry. but because of the opposition by the sena-bjp alliance, a decision on this matter had been deferred. it will be taken on wednesday. ``we will insist on the session being held for three weeks,'' he said. mr munde said the df government had started addressing major issues outside the house when the legislature was in session. he was referring to a discussion between shetkari sanghatana leader sharad joshi with chief minister vilasrao deshmukh last week which had resulted in the sanghatana calling off the agitation. ``no major issue, including the developmental backlog of vidarbha, had been discussed in the house. in fact, no single session during the df tenure has so far been completed its scheduled period,'' he pointed out. in the assembly, former speaker datta nalawade and former finance minister mahadevrao shivankar tried to raise the subject of the rasta roko. in the legislative council, sena member shishir shinde alleged that he had seen innocent bystanders being attacked by the police in anjangaon.

17,NGOs' forum releases manifesto for civic polls,"mumbai: an alliance of a dozen citizens' organisations and ngos have prepared a draft citizens' manifesto for the february 2002 elections. the draft prepared by organisations such as action for good governance and networking in india (agni), mumbai grahak panchayat (mgp), dignity foundation and citispace details the demands and expectations of citizens from political parties and the candidates they field for the polls. the organisations have also drawn a merit rating system, the `agnipariksha', listing the ``citizens requirements of candidates'' for the civic elections. the manifesto was released recently by former civic chief and a member of agni, d.m. sukhtankar. the organisations have appealed to politicians to endorse the manifesto which urges upon the would-be corporators to work for the betterment of civic amenities and the infrastructure in the city. mr sukhtankar said the corporators should take their electorate into confidence with regard to the planning and execution of civic works in the wards. the manifesto makes it mandatory for the corporators to support the tough measures taken by the civic authorities for cutting down the budget deficit. as regards the merit system, the ngos expect the candidates to have a stable and known source of income, ability to grasp issues of civic governance, no criminal record, a readiness to reveal assets etc. mr sukhtankar said the organisations would support candidates passing this criteria irrespective of their political affiliation. shirish deshpande of the mgp said there was a tendency among the public to blame the authorities and the elected representatives for all their woes. ``the fault is ours,'' he said, ``because we do not elect the right people.'' mr deshpande said the manifesto had a message for the political parties, ``that the electorate has awakened and will not blindly stamp on the ballot papers''. the organisations hope that ``merit'', and not just ``money power'', should play a dominant role in the coming elections.

20,"Railways facing 'dilemma', says minister","new delhi: indian railways, country's biggest parastatal, is facing the dilemma of competition on one hand and compassion on the other, as it struggles to be competitive while fulfilling its social responsibilities, minister of state for railways, digvijay singh, said here on tuesday. ""compassion and competition do not go together and in a country where 27 per cent of population is still below poverty line and rate of unemployment is high, we have a social responsibility,"" singh said, addressing a conference on ""railways: future development,"" hosted by cii. ""today's age of competition demands only the deserving to be in the race and throws up not only challenges but also opportunities and problems,"" the minister said. quoting a recent planning commission study which said that there was around 45 crore of 'marginal population', he said these perspectives had also to be taken into account while framing any realistic assessment of the problems and prospects of the railways. k yerrannaidu, chairman of standing committee on railways, asked the government to consider a 'reasonable' hike in passenger fares, because increasing freight charges would prove counter-productive for the railways' financial health. ""what we have asked is a reasonable increase in passenger fare as increasing the freight charges again and again will only lead to diversion (of freight traffic to road transport), which the railways is experiencing now in a big way,"" he told pti. he said freight charges had been increased phenomenally to subsidise the passenger fares that had remained static since last three to four years.

24,Opp prevents govt from tabling terror Bill,"new delhi: the prevention of terror ordinance was not tabled in the lok sabha on tuesday after all, with the government prevented from doing so by an angry, slogan-shouting opposition. after much confusion on whether home minister l.k. advani had indeed introduced the bill, it was ascertained that the house was adjourned before he could do so after repeated pleas by the speaker failed to pacify the opposition members clamouring in the aisles. advani was seeking the chair's permission to introduce poto before the zero hour when the opposition started shouting slogans. the speaker's office said the process of introducing the motion had not been completed and the bill had thus not been tabled. at a meeting convened by the speaker on tuesday afternoon, opposition leaders said members of their parties had entered the well of the house as they thought the bill had been introduced by the home minister, sources said. cpm leader somnath chatterjee said later that they only learnt at the speaker's meeting that the bill had in fact not been tabled. the opposition leaders also clarified that members had trooped into the well of the house only after the speaker had announced adjournment and so it could not attract action under the new code of conduct. the opposition later reiterated it would put obstacles in the way of poto at every stage. the congress political affairs committee will meet late on tuesday night to decide its final strategy on the issue. party spokesman anand sharma said: ""if the government has even a fig leaf of shame left they should not push poto."" chatterjee said the opposition was united on the matter. ""we are committed in our opposition to it and we will fight it to the best of our abilities. poto must not be brought."" bjp members have, meanwhile, been asked to cancel all engagements and stay in town till december 24, clearly in preparation for a joint session. advani told a meeting of the bjp parliamentary party that all possible amendments had been made in the ordinance and any further changes would render it ineffective as a tool to battle terrorism. bjp spokesman v.k. malhotra said advani had appealed to opposition parties to help pass the bill. the government hopes to introduce poto on wednesday now, but with the opposition in no mood to budge, it may well be another day of adjournments.

27,"CET selection list not fair, say teachers","kolar: the recruitment process for teachers taken up recently by the karnataka government through the common entrance test is unscientific and erroneous, allege some tch graduates. a number of them plan to take up the issue in the karnataka high court. a meeting of those affected by the process was held in kolar on tuesday. some high court advocates took part in the meeting and discussed the legal aspects and implications. d.s. raghuram, tch graduate, and chitnahalli srinivas, joc graduate, allege that the selection list published by the department of public instruction is improper and have urged the government to immediately modify it. they have alleged that though similar question papers were given to all candidates who took the cet, the state government had bifurcated science teachers and arts teachers in the selection process. this method has given scope for a bias, they allege. raghuram said that even those who had secured mere single-digit marks in the science category have secured a place in the selection list, while those who have secured over 100 under arts have failed to make it. despite the government's assurance that joc candidates would be considered for recruitment, none of these candidates have been selected, complained srinivas, a joc graduate. even those candidates who have completed their tch after sslc as per the old regulations have been totally ignored, they allege. the duo also alleged that though the state government has fixed reservation under the physically handicapped category, the list does not specify the percentage of posts earmarked for such candidates, they said. despite many representations, the state government had turned a deaf ear to the demand that those who have reached the `age bar' be considered on sympathetic grounds, raghuram added. going by these complaints, it appears that the state government has grossly violated rules and regulations and those affected will be approaching the high court seeking to set aside the recruitment process and start afresh. a similar situation prevails across the state and those sailing in the same boat are in touch, raghuram said.

28,Demolition of Gandhian heritage stalled after protests,"ahmedabad: scores of people came out onto the ashram road on tuesday to protest ahmedabad municipal corporation's designs to demolish 14 single-storeyed structures alongside the historic sabarmati ashram. corporation wants to lay a road _ under one of its town planning schemes _ that will run through these houses up to a plot that has a tube well near the gandhi ashram in sabarmati. but, the fact that these houses were set up by gandhi himself for harijan artisans to stay in has brought together gandhians who are fighting tooth and nail to save this heritage site. the plots were allotted some 70 years ago to these artisans who used to dye khadi clothes. at 10.30 am when vehicles of amc's anti-encroachment department along with the police reached the spot, they were greeted with freedom fighters and local inhabitants. bull dozers were stopped on the track with localites climbing atop them. work never began as gandhians like chunibhai vaidya and freedom fighters joined forces. kanjibhai goel, a 69-year-old freedom fighter, said: the police and amc demolition squad will have to gun me down before they can even touch these 70-year-old houses. goel stays at the gandhi ashram and has pitched in for the harijans' cause. and, not just the gandhian heritage issue, the localites point towards a flaw in the design of the proposed tp road. bhikhubhai mangalbhai rathore, whose father was settled at that spot near sabarmati ashram by gandhiji, said, ""the proposed road requires to break our homes down but just a 100 metres away, a road that reaches the same destination already exists. either this can be broadened to handle that extra traffic or there is a plot alongside our house which is only partially used as a garage. but, no the corporation wants our homes!"" chunibhai vaidya told tnn: i feel that a plot behind the existing houses, through which the tp scheme road is to pass, belongs to a builder. therefore there are forces other than amc that want this road to materialise here _ even though it will break at least 20 homes. we can only hope that the state government will heed our appeals."" west zone deputy municipal commissioner j g hingrajia replied, ""the localities were served notices earlier and even the high court had directed that these houses be removed to make way for the tp scheme road. after witnessing so many senior citizens, gandhians and local residents opposing the move, we have decided to give them a couple of days' time to sort the matter out."" but, that is little solace for harishbhai jhala, who has been brought up at this locality. ""my friends and i studied at the children's school _ bal mandir _ that too will be demolished and so will our homes. the amc is acting autocratically without considering our sentiments or that of gandhiji, who had settled our parents here decades back. this matter is far from over...""

29,CBI allowed to chargesheet ex-ministers,"ahmedabad: the cbi will now be able to file chargesheet against two former ministers - jasabhai barad and vitthal shah - as well as three ias officers - vijaysinh parmar, a m bhardwaj and d k rao - accused in the rs 6.4 crore transport contract scam. justice m h kadri of the gujarat high court on tuesday rejected criminal miscellaneous applications filed by the scam accused seeking to quash and set aside the fir filed against them by the state government. the court held that the decision taken by these public servants, in allowing increase in the existing transport contract rates for 1997-98 and further extending the tenure of the contract march 31, 1999 'was arbitrary, unjustified and violative of the condition of the transport contract'. in its judgement the court observed that these public servants abused their official position and entered into a criminal conspiracy with the transport contractors to cause undue burden to the public exchequer. the court also pointed out that to perpetuate the offence, the established procedure of administration, rules of business and financial management were deliberately violated. it therefore amounted to offences of criminal conspiracy, cheating, misconduct and abuse of official position. the court then observed that rise in diesel price did not cause the escalation of prices of other components and that the representation of the transporters' association on basis of which prices were increased, was not processed properly. assistant director was bypassed in processing the file to avoid a dissent opinion. there was no precedent of hike in the transport rates in tune with the present hike. the government had alternatives to counter such a movement than bowing to the pressure of a few transporters, the judgement said. the court observed that the representation did not reflect the views of the association in true sense. all the signatories were not genuine, some were forgeries and it was concluded that it was not a true reflection of the views of the transport contractors' association. gujarat government had filed a first investigation report after an internal inquiry that during 1997-98, huge monetary loss was caused to the state and gujarat state civil supplies corporation (gscsc) by the accused. they had awarded a disproportionate hike in the contractual rate of transportation of levy sugar and food grains for the public distribution system and thus allowed ineligible gains to the transporters. this was despite the fact that the contract did not provide for revision of rates due to fuel hike or other reasons and though upwardly revision to the tune of 30 per cent was given after a diesel rate hike. advocate general sn shelat with additional public prosecutor samir dave appeared for the state and advocate mr shah additional standing counsel for the cbi. the accused were then holding offices as minister and senior bureaucrats in the shankersinh vaghela government. barad was minister for food, civil supplies and consumer affairs, shah was holding the same portfolio as minister of state. bhardwaj was additional chief secretary in food and civil supplies department, parmar was director of the gscsc and dk rao was director food and civil supplies. the state government had in december 1998, sought a cbi probe into the case and the centre had issued the notification last november, 2000.

30,"Panchayat polls: BJP, Cong in war of words","rajkot: a war of words has broken out between the bjp and the congress in the run-up to the gram panchayat elections, with leaders of both parties making claims and counter-claims. congress leader and dhoraji legislator vithal radadiya on tuesday claimed that his party had an upper hand in villages that had opted for the samras scheme, where the candidates had been elected uncontested. radadiya told 'the times of india' that out of the 372 gram panchayats that had gone for samras, as many as 233 were under the congress belt while the bjp had bagged just 80. bjp leader mahendra padaliya disputed radadiya's claim. but the congress leader challenged padaliya to prove his contention. according to radadiya, who masterminded the congress victory in the district panchayat polls held just a year ago, four gram panchayats in kotda sanghani and three in maliya had gone to the independents. in as many as 786 gram panchayats, elections will be held. radadiya said the gram panchayats in dhoraji, jasdan, jamkandorna, lodhika, kotdasanghani, jetpur and rajkot talukas had backed the congress. there could be some truth in radadiya's claim as most of the places mentioned by him are considered to be his strongholds. when contacted, padaliya said that the bjp had not prepared any list to stake claim to the gram panchayats that had opted for samras. ""we have not made any review of the gram panchayats."" meanwhile, both parties are feeling the heat of the polls with voters in many centres posing 'uncomfortable' and, at times, embarrassing queries to the leaders. most questions are on their future plans for the panchayat. it is clear that assurances alone will not work this time around and that voters have begun to demand their due. unlike assembly or lok sabha elections national issues are of no consequence to these elections. what matters are local issues - power to irrigate fields, support price for groundnut, cotton and other cash crops and adequate water supply. on all these counts, the ruling bjp will have a lot of explanation to do. the power supply is erratic and people in the rural areas get just 8 to 10 hours of supply. the government has failed to prove good support prices and co-operatives have stopped purchasing groundnut from farmers, which has left them fuming. and lack of long-term planning has ensured that the government does not have a viable solution to solve the drinking water crisis. congress leaders are going from village to village highlighting these 'failures'. in addition they are laying stress on the fact that two months after he took charge, chief minister modi is still unable to find a 'safe' seat to contest an assembly by-election.
