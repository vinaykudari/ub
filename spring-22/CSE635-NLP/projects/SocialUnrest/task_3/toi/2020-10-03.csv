0,BKU to organise rallies against govt,"BATHINDA: Farmers seem to be divided on how to tackle the aftermath of the lathicharge at Bhai Bakhtaur on October 1,while six organisations called for a statewide protest on October 10, Bhartiya Kisan Union (E), Ugrah group, announced on Friday to start protest rallies against the Punjab government from Saturday.

Farmers'' organisations are protesting against the lathicharge on the farmers and the death of farmer Gurdev Singh. After paying homage to the deceased farmer at Maur Charat Singh Wala village on Friday in which about 200 members of BKU (Ugrah) participated, Malook Singh, the acting state president, and Janda Singh Jethuke, the district president, said that for the next one week the protest rallies would be organised in the villages all over the state. In the rallies, the effigies of the Punjab and Central governments would also be burnt.

Joginder Singh Ugrah and Sukhdev Singh Kokrikalan, the general secretary of the union, are still in police custody since their arrest on October 1.

The union leaders alleged that the police used force on Friday to stop the Ugrah group members from participating in a ceremony to pay homage to the deceased farmer at his village. Earlier, no member of the Ugrah group was allowed to participate in the cremation of the farmer, alleged the leaders.

They also alleged that besides the lathicharge on the union members at the dharna site on October 1, all members and leaders of the union who were arrested were beaten up in custody.

The leaders demanded that Kokrikalan be shifted to Ludhiana or Patiala for treatment as the doctors in Civil Hospital, Bathinda, were not attending to him properly.

Kokrikalan was admitted to Civil Hospital after he received many fractures in the police lathicharge.

On Thursday, farmers rejected a compromise in which the family of the deceased farmer was offered Rs 2 lakh and Rs 50,000 each was offered to four injured farmers. In a meeting on Friday, the BKU (Ugrah) demanded Rs 5 lakh as compensation for the deceased.

The difference between the Ugrah group and other farmers organisation had surfaced on October 1 when a compromise was made with the administration. The Ugrah group had the intention of prolonging the agitation after declining offer of Rs 2 lakh compensation to the deceased farmer, the other groups were in mood of compromise. Most of the leaders and members who were arrested by the police for the attempt of murder case and other members who were beaten up at the dharna site also belong to Ugrah group.

1,"DIG reviews law, order situation","PATHANKOT/GURDASPUR: DIG (border range) G S Sahota on Friday held a closeddoor meeting with senior police officials to review the law and order situation in the border district of Gurdaspur in the wake of a sudden spurt in the crime rate and increasing incidents of robbery and murder in Punjab in the recent days.

At the meeting, which lasted over four hours, Sahota told police officials to set up special nakas and increase night vigil in their respective areas. Gurdaspur district is vulnerable to terrorist violence due to its proximity to J&K and HP from where illicit liquor and contrabands such as cannabis And hashish were being smuggled into Punjab.

Police sources said all the entry points to the state from J&K and HP were under special surveillance and vigil had been stepped in 15 villages near Madhopur barrier, which had witnessed attacks and burglaries by Kale Kacchewale gang in the past.

Gurdaspur SSP R P S Brar said two members of a gang had purchased trucks from HP, but forged their papers to get them registered in Pathankot in order to evade tax. They have been arrested, but hunt is on for third member who had procured forged registration papers for these vehicles from Pathankot.

2,"Sarpanch denies clash between Jats, dalits","PATIALA: The Budhmore incident in which eight villagers had suffered injuries was not a Jat-dalit clash, claimed village sarpanch Bhajan Singh and his political opponent Lakhbir Singh, while talking to mediapersons here on Friday.

They said that someone had abused a person, which had agitated their supporters. â€˜â€˜Both the groups have cleared their misunderstanding and the dispute has been resolved,â€™â€™ they added.

The police have also denied any clash between Jats and dalits. No case has been registered.

There was some conflict within a group of Congressmen over the choice of the candidate for the post of sarpanch during the panchayat elections. Lakhbir Singhâ€™s father Sadhu Singh, vice-president of the Congress block, was interested in contesting the election but the Congressmen supported Bhajan Singh who won the election by defeating Sadhu Singh. Block Congress president Piara Singh Thind and another Congress leader Umar Ranjit Singh have worked out a compromise between the two.

3,Engg students protest against fee hike,"MUMBAI: Students at the SIES graduate school of technology at Nerul, Navi Mumbai are protesting against the decision to increase the annual fees for the second-year engineering course. The management recently decided to increase fees by 200 per cent.

Some 90-odd affected students have joined hands and moved the Bombay high court against the ""illegal fee hike"" after having failed to persuade the management to rethink its revised fee structure. The fees have gone up to Rs 49,600 from Rs 14,600. The case is likely to come up for hearing on Monday.

The students have prayed for an injunction from the court, arguing that fees cannot be revised for the second-year course as per the guidelines of the Directorate of Technical Education (DTE), which monitors the functioning of engineering colleges across the state.

College authorities, however, have demanded that all fees be paid at one go and have said that students who fail to pay the full fees by October 5 will be restrained from attending classes.

Attempts to contact college principal P.V. Parameswaran were unsuccesful.

""The SIES management, however, has illegally and unilaterally hiked fees, despite the directions of the DET. No doubt the facilities provided by the college and teaching faculty are the best one can get, but that certainly does not justify the sudden hike,"" complained a student, who insisted on anonymity.

The DTE has in fact circulated a note to all engineering, architecture and hotel management colleges, restraining them from increasing the fees for senior students who have spent one academic year in the college.

The DTE directive, issued on September 19, clearly states that the fees for all students in the second, third or fourth year should remain what they had paid at the beginning of their course in that college.

The students claim that SIES is the only engineering college which has hiked its fees. ""If the hike is not challenged now, then all other colleges will resort to such a hike,"" a student said.

He said the college had initially offered to accept the fees in three to four instalments. However, with the students refusing to pay the revised fees, the college has demanded that full fees be paid.

4,Ex-Tata workers attempt suicide,"MUMBAI: Two former contract workers of the Tata Power Company attempted to commit suicide at Hutatma Chowk on Friday.

Dousing themselves with kerosene, Anant Dalvi (45) and Akhtar Khan (42), who are members of the Tata Hydrocompanies Employee Union and are legally challenging their lay-off in 1997, set themselves ablaze and tried to enter Bombay House, the Tata group headquarters.

However, the security guards at Bombay House managed to shut the doors and prevent the duo from entering the building. Policemen on bandobast duty at Hutatma Chowk rushed the badly burned men to St George''s Hospital, where they are reported to be in a critical condition.

The two men were among the 70-odd workers employed on a contract basis by TPC for its various projects. On completion of the projects in 1996-''97, all the contracted workers were rendered jobless. The union is challenging many such dismissals in the labour court. The matter is sub-judice.

Mr Dalvi and Mr Khan were urging the union to take up their demand for a permanent job or monetary compensation with the company management.

On Friday, they along with eight other aggrieved workers, gathered outside Bombay House to meet the union leaders who were to sign a salary agreement with the management.

When the union leaders failed to turn up by noon, Mr Dalvi and Mr Khan proceeded with their attempt at self-immolation at around 12.30 p.m. The police alleged that it was a premeditated act.

5,Front to rethink rally-ban stand,"KOLKATA: The public support to the Calcutta High Court ruling on rallies has finally prompted a rethink in the CPM headquarters at Alimuddin Street. Left Front chairman Biman Bose has called an emergency Front meeting on Saturday to decide their strategy.

Keeping with the winds of change in the cityâ€™s psyche, CPM leaders are likely to choose a middle path at the meeting without confronting the spirit of the order. The view has been doing the rounds at Alimuddin Street for quite some time, barring a few hardliners like Chittabrata Majumdar and Benoy Konar who refuse to accept any restrictions on the path of protest. CPM state secretary Anil Biswas has dubbed the ruling as an ""infringement on the fundamental right to protest"".

However, he is not averse to imposing ""reasonable restrictions"" on rallies and meetings. He had earlier asked partymen not to resort to impromptu blockades on roads or rail tracks.

This was in tune with what Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had proposed months after he became the chief minister.

He urged political parties to restrict gatherings at the Brigade Parade Ground, Sahid Minar and Rani Rashmani Avenue and avoid holding rallies on weekdays.

The issue had come up for discussion in the LF meetings earlier, where most of the partners except the RSP had accepted the general guidelines. However, the Left trade unions dumped the proposal saying that they would not prevent workers from taking to the streets in the event of an exigency such as lockouts in jute mills.

After talks, the CPM and the CPI tried slotting their gatherings at the Brigade Parade Ground on Sundays.

The CPM will try to balance between extremes to keep both the captains of industry and the labour happy. It may express concern over the recent spurt in judicial activism, but would not go the whole hog against the verdict.

Instead, the party would prefer that the regulations, if any, should come from the administration or the legislature.

The RSP would take a hard stance at Saturday meeting.

""The ruling is an extension of what the CM had said. We are not going to accept it. Let the industrialists desist from indiscriminate lockouts and lay-offs, the workers will discipline themselves,"" an RSP leader said.

7,Ex-Tata employee dies in suicide bid,"MUMBAI: Anant Dalvi, 45, a former contract employee of Tata Power, who tried to immolate himself on Friday outside Bombay House, succumbed to his injuries at 11.30 pm on Friday.

Akhtar Khan, who had also tried to immolate himself, was shifted to Masina Hospital and was in a critical condition.

""Not a single person from the management or the union has come to the hospital so far,"" Kotian said.

8,Peace vital for J&K's development: Mehbooba,"SRINAGAR: PDP President Mehbooba Mufti, on Saturday said restoration of peace was vital for development of the state in general and the Kashmir Valley in particular.

She said that the biggest achievement of the Congress-PDP coalition government is a check on the Human Rights Violations by the security forces. ""I do not claim that Human Rights Violations have been curbed altogether, but there is a responsive government, which immediately reaches out to the sufferers of the Human Rights Violations.""

She emphasised that immediate action was being taken into the complaints of rights violations.

She pointed out that whether it was the killing of an Imam and his son in Baramulla or the killing of a youth at Tujjar Sharief, the government functionaries not only visited the families of victims but ensured action against the erring security forces personnel. ""Such steps have created a sense of security among the people,"" she said.

Highlighting the problems confronted by the people, Mehbooba said, the major problem is of unemployment and power tariff hike, which she said need to be tackled on priority.

She said the problem of unemployment can''t be tackled by the government alone and for encouraging private sector investment, which could provide employment opportunities to the people, peace is essential.

To ensure development of Srinagar City, Mehbooba urged the people to participate in the upcoming Municipal Corporation Election, which would provide a new opening for the equitable development of the city.

Speaking on the occasion, Chief Minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed reiterated his government''s resolve to facilitate peaceful resolution of Kashmir issue through a comprehensive dialogue process.

Addressing one-day convention of People''s Democratic Party Workers of Srinagar city on Saturday morning, the Chief Minister said, ""This is our faith and commitment that the solution of Kashmir issue lies in talks.""

He said that sooner or later Pakistan would have to positively respond to the offer of friendship extended to it by the Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee from Srinagar. ""There can be hurdles in this treacherous path, but it would ultimately culminate at a happy ending,"" he said adding that people''s yearning for peace would force both the countries to come to the table, taking the people of Jammu and Kashmir along.

The Chief Minister said till a solution of the Kashmir issue is worked out, ""we can''t afford to leave our people to suffer the miseries of violence and distress of day to day problems."" He said the government has to mitigate the sufferings of the people and ""I alongwith my cabinet colleagues are working day and night to reach out to the people to redress their grievances.""

He said for the first time since independence, the people of the State have developed a faith and trust in the government and that is only because of the pro-people policies adopted by the present dispensation.

He said PDP''s philosophy of ''Healing Touch'' was even approved by the Prime Minister and the leader of opposition, Sonia Gandhi.

Sayeed said the basic objective of constituting PDP was to give a forceful voice to the people of the State, who otherwise were all along left in lurch by the previous dispensations.

He said after the Coalition Government took over, there has been visible improvement in the situation on all fronts and the Human Rights Violations have come down to a large extent.

9,BSP a fund collecting party: Digvijay,"GUNA, MP: Terming the BSP as a ""fund collecting"" party, Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Digvijay Singh has said perhaps it ""forced"" its MLAs in Uttar Pradesh to quit en masse and join other parties.

""The BSP has been reduced to a party collecting donations and people say money power is its main criterion for ticket allocation. It may be a reason for en masse desertion of BSP MLAs in Uttar Pradesh,"" he told reporters.

On the Taj corridor scandal, he said if former UP Chief Minister Mayawati is held guilty in the matter, BJP leader and then UP Minister Lalji Tandon cannot be given a clean chit.

Ruling out any pre-poll understanding with the BSP in Madhya Pradesh, he said the Congress is capable of fighting the coming Assembly election on its own strength and claimed that it would bag about 135 out of the 230 seats.

10,Badal calls PAC meeting on farmers' problems,"CHANDIGARH: Shiromani Akali Dal president Parkash Singh Badal has warned Chief Minister Amarinder Singh against his alleged ""continuing policy of bloody confrontation with the farmers in the state"".

Badal has convened a meeting of the party''s political affairs committee on October 10. The meeting to be held at Badal''s residence here would discuss measures to oppose the governement''s policies against farmers.

In a statement Badal said that the chief minister''s policy of taking repressive measures against farmers would not be allowed.

He said instead to redressing farmers'' grievances, the chief minister had been delaying them with an iron hand.

He demanded that the chief minister be removed from his office and a judicial inquiry be ordered into incidents of attacks on farmers.

Badal said farmers had been demanding nothing more than the fulfillment of promises which he had himself made to the during the election campaign of February last year.

11,`Govt's move on ECBs a political gimmick',"PATHANKOT: Punjab Rajput Sabha in league with Samajak Nyaya Manch of Rajasthan under the leadership of Devi Lal Bhati and convener Vikram Singh has termed Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee''s recent statement to set up a commission to extend quota to economically backward classes (ECBs) as a political gimmick aimed at the ensuing elections.

The Rajput Sabha said that quota should be based on economic basis not only in the field of jobs but also in education, panchayats, block samitis, zila parishads and vidhan sabhas.

Fearing that the commission report on EBCs will take long time and may be shelved after the assembly elections in the four states, Rajput Maha Sabha, Punjab working president S S Thakur said the Rajput Sabha in the north zone rejects the government move and will declare its new course of action within a few days.

12,Conversion law will be put to test on Sunday,"VADODARA: The Gujarat Freedom of Religion Act will be put to test for the first time on Sunday with the Vishwa Boudh Sangh claiming it will convert one lakh people to Buddhism. A letter the city police gave to the Vishwa Boudh Sangh (VBS) has made it clear that going ahead with conversions without the district magistrateâ€™s permission would be illegal.

The police issued the letter to VBS general secretary Bhante Sanghpriya on Friday night. It also warned that defiance of the Act was an offence and offenders could be arrested. The police could allow the conversion programme if the organisation got the collectorâ€™s permission.

The VBS was not able to obtain such a permission till this evening. At a press conference on Saturday, VBS national president Budhpriya Rahul announced a mass conversion programme on Sunday, wherein a lakh people were expected to embrace Buddhism. â€œWe are disappointed as the police commissioner has insisted on a written permission from the collector. Though we had sent the letter seeking police security quite early (on September 26), the department has delayed its response and sent an objection letter yesterday. As per the present status, conversion into Buddhism is legal, as it is an offshoot of Hinduism,â€� argued Budhpriya Rahul.

Amidst the confusion, the Sangh members have decided to go ahead with the programmes. â€œWe have been granted permission from the Vadodara Municipal Corporation to hold the programme at the VMC-owned plot in Sama. We hope there will be no more hassles, but are prepared to court arrest if the government tries to disrupt the programme,â€� says Bhante Sanghpriya. Commissioner of police Sudhir Sinha said that the police would make bandobast for the gathering, but expected few people to come. â€œIntelligence reports do not indicate that many people would gather.

The programme has been organised on a 3,000 sq m plot. Not more than 12,000 people can gather there,â€� Sinha said. The law would take its course if any Act was violated on Sunday. â€œWe will act according to the situation. The law will take its course,â€� Sinha said.

Incidentally, the Sangh had withdrawn its plans on two occasions earlier â€” of mass conversion and selfimmolation to oppose the sale of Ambedkar Bhavan here. If VBS has criticised the government for its â€˜apathyâ€™ towards the Sangh, the administration, on the other hand, has not taken a clear stand on the issue.

13,Avinash’s elevation gives a twist to district politics,"HOSHIARPUR:With Avinash Rai Khanna, BJP MLA from Garhshankar gaining suddenly in stature after being elevated to the post of the BJP state president and the district Congress being a divided house, politics appears to have taken a sharp U-turn in the district.

The profile of the district has gone up since Khannaâ€™s appointment as the state BJP chief. Political observers here feel that the BJP will emerge stronger after this new development as the district would soon emerge as the hub of BJP politics.

Some political observers, who do not wish to be named, said that since the Congress is marred with factionalism as it is split in two groups, the one owing allegiance to the health minister Romesh Dogra and the other to MP Charanjit Channi, the new development could play a decisive role in the approaching Lok Sabha elections.

Kuldip Nanda, DCC president, however, refutes these assumptions. â€˜â€˜Khannaâ€™s appointment would have no bearing on the districtâ€™s politics and the BJP was a divided house,â€™â€™ asserted Nanda. He claimed that the rivalry between Tikshan Sud, BJP MLA from Hoshiarpur, and Avinash Rai Khanna was an open secret. â€˜â€˜Khanna was a novice in politics and his presence in the district did not bother the Congress party,â€™â€™ he added.

Khanna, since his famous shoe-polishing campaign, has been looked upon as the future BJP candidate for the Lok Sabha elections from the Hoshiarpurconstituency.

Although itâ€™s early in the day to predict that whether Khanna will continue to remain in the fray for the Lok Sabha ticket as he has just assumed a new responsibility, political observers opine that Khanna is at present in a better position to contest the elections. Contesting the Lok Sabha elections while simply being an MLA and fighting them with the tag of the BJP president are two different things, they said.

Meanwhile, the immediate challenge before Khanna is to set his house in order as factionalism in the BJP was witnessed in full public view during the previous president Rinwaâ€™s visit to Hoshiarpur sometime back. Khanna denied any rift within the district BJP and portrayed a picture of harmony and unity.

14,Man pushes his father-in-law into canal,"MOGA: Upset over his fatherin-lawâ€™s decision to give away his property to his daughter, a man pushed him into a canal and later showered bullets on him injuring him critically in Muktsar district, police said on Saturday.

16,New netas and the politics of style,"NEW DELHI: Delhi politicians have always had it rough in terms of style and individuality. Playing little brother to Big Brother members of Parliament was their lot.

Now there has emerged a breed of young, brash, and ambitious leaders. We profiled four of them, two each from Congress and BJP.

Transport minister Ajay Maken, Congress MLA Arvinder Singh Lovely, BJP vice- president and likely candidate from Saket, Vijay Jolly and BJP councillor and likely candidate from Hauz Khas assembly seat, Arti Mehra.

Designer togs, Fast cars: Arvinder Singh Lovely''s favourite colour is black, colour co-ordinated with a maroon pagri. Like transport minister Ajay Maken, Lovely wears casual shirts and trousers most of the time.

""I feel one should be casually dressed just like our constituents,"" he says. Maken, embarrassed at being asked questions on his attire says that wearing casual clothes comes naturally to him.

When Arti Mehra first became an MCD councillor from Gulmohar Park, her Honda car elicited much speculation. ""I became notorious as the Hondawali councillor,"" she says with a laugh. Jolly drives a Tata Safari now and had a Mahindra Jeep earlier.

Business of Politics: While Maken comes from a political family, Lovely, Mehra and Jolly hail from business backgrounds. Jolly, a graduate from Sri Ram College of Commerce runs a successful export business, Mehra was a buyer for duty free shop in Dubai, Maken was a chemistry student at Hansraj who turned to politics after the death of his uncle Lalit Maken, and Lovely frankly admits to being a burden on his family. ""I spend my family''s money on politics,"" he says with a laugh.

All of them have a background in student politics, which was resisted by their parents. ""My father frankly told me that if he heard anything bad about me, he would take me to task,"" says Lovely, with a laugh.

Self-consciously different: Almost all of them live, breathe and network through their cellphones, two in Lovely''s case. ""I just need two phone calls to arrange a meeting of my workers,"" says Mehra.

Jolly even campaigns through SMS. Maken, says he''s quite lost without his Nokia communicator. ""But thats not the only way I''m different,"" says Maken.

According to the 2001 census 65 per cent of Delhi voters fall in the 18-35 age group. Political parties are now looking to appeal to a younger and cosmopolitan voter profile.

""The kind of voters who care more about roads, water, power and tax than mandir and Mandal,"" says a senior source in the Congress. As for the elections, watch this space.

17,Delhi schools under attack: Pokemon mania rules,"NEW DELHI: Four boys, all aged 8, are trading their Pokemon cards. They bargain in Pokemon lingo, calculate the weight, height and powers of their cards. After the super trade-off, they scream: Gotta catch ''em all.

It''s the attack of the Pokemons, and teachers all over Delhi are up in arms against it. While many schools have had to resort to banning students from bringing Pokemon cards and books to school, others like Delhi Public School, Mother''s International, St Columbus and Modern School have issued verbal disciplinary warnings.

Pokemon fever has hit like an epidemic and is driving teachers and parents, crazy: ""Every child carries these cards in his pocket; they are trading in classrooms, recess breaks and buses. They are obsessed with the cards. They just won''t stop trading. So we had to put a stop to it,"" says a teacher from a leading public school, who didn''t want to be named.

""I take language development classes, but the only words I hear are Pokemon and the other characters.""

""We have told students not to bring cards or trade in school,"" says Shobhana Krishnan, a class III teacher at Modern School, who has been forced to confiscate cards several times.

Children are singing Pokemon rap song, wearing Pokemon clothes, trading with cards and even buying Pokemon organisers for Rs 290.

Take Arjun Krishnan, aged 11, a student of Modern School. He has collected 400 Pokemon cards, but wants more. ""I like to put them in my book or trade them, but mostly I like to battle with my friends. My friends have 700 cards.""

Meet another Pokemon group from St Columbus school, comprising Shyam Aggarwal, Sarthak Aggarwal, Nantash Negi and Shubash Maheshwari, all aged 10. They have all collected around 100 Pokemon cards each.

""One of our friends has 2,000 pokemon cards. Carry your Pokemon with you, and you''re ready for anything. You''ve got the power in your hands. More cards mean more power,"" says Shyam.

What, or who, exactly are Pokemons? From the land of toons, Pokemon and his 150 friends have magical powers, which can burn, give electric shocks and can kick too.

Globally, the Pokemon craze â€” movies, video games, comics, merchandise and trading cards â€” is worth an estimated US $ 5 billion. ""Ever since we started the Pokemon series in Hindi in May, it''s taken the kids by storm,"" says a spokesperson of the Cartoon Network.

""The show tempts children to keep collecting Pokemon. The punchline is: ''gotta catch them all'', it''s driving me crazy and has taken over my child''s mind completely,"" says Niti Jain, a mother, who buys a pack of Pokemon cards, priced Rs 75 for her son every week.

Anupriya Chadha, child psychologist feels, ""Pokemon transports the child into a fantasy world that is more exciting than the real world. The trading encourages the child to participate in the manipulative realm of role-play.""

Three-year-old pre-schooler and Pokemon addict, Samvid Uday, says: ""I hope one day I''ll become a Pokemon master. "" He screams: ""Bulbasore attack, Bulbasore.""
