0,Kerala govt to seek more loans from ADB,"THRISSUR: Kerala government would seek more loans from Asian Development Bank for development of the state despite opposition from various quarters, Finance Minister K Sankaranarayanan said on Friday.

He said that the entire process of taking loans from ADB had been transparent; the Assembly and the public at large had been informed about the terms and conditions of ADB loans taken earlier.

Under the changed global economic scenario, almost all the countries in the world had availed themselves of loans from the World Bank, IMF and the ADB for development projects, he said.

The CPM should clarify the reasons for their objection to taking loans from ADB at the rate of 8.05 per cent interest.

The West Bengal government had also taken loans from the World Bank and ADB as per terms and conditions approved by the Central government, he said.

Sankaranarayanan said that the ADB officials would not be allowed to inspect the government offices.

1,Anti-Dowry Day: rally vows to fight menace,"BANGALORE: For Latha Jayaprakash, Friday was a day to recall the deadliest day in her life, when her husband and in-laws poured kerosene on her, two years ago, because she did not bring enough dowry.

Latha survived the attack. Today, she lives for her only daughter. Flagging off a rally of over 5,000 people on the occasion of Anti-Dowry Day, Latha was one among the hundreds of women, who have been harassed for dowry.

The Anti-Dowry Day organised by the Karnataka State Commission for Women, saw poster, essay and skit competitions against the dowry menace. The rally which was flagged off from Cubbon Park, was attended by thousands of students.

Various colleges and schools participated in the rally and pledged to fight the menace. Addressing the rally, women and child welfare minister C. Motamma said violence against women can be curbed only if women themselves fight against crimes perpetuated on them.

""No one can come to your rescue. Only you can fight for your rights. Unless you stand up and fight against violence meted out to you, there will be no end to dowry deaths and rape cases,"" she added.

The rally culminated at the Government Arts and Science college.

2,Bengal govt proscribes Taslima's latest book,"KOLKATA: In the face of widespread protests from a section of intellectuals, the West Bengal government on Friday proscribed controversial Bangladeshi writer Taslima Nasreenâ€™s book Dwikhandito (split in two) which had purportedly hurt the sentiments of the Muslim community.

Announcing the governmentâ€™s decision, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said, â€œI have read the book and it has been proscribed.â€�

Official sources said the step had been taken under Section 153A of the IPC since it was found that the book could spread enmity and disturb communal harmony.

Under this provision, the publication, sale and marketing of the book has been stopped with immediate effect.

Meanwhile, the police seized over 2,500 copies of the book after raiding the premises of the binders at College Street on Thursday night.

The book, the third volume of the writerâ€™s autobiography known as Ka, had already been banned in neighbouring Bangladesh.

The Calcutta High Court had last week passed an interim stay on the publication and sale of the book following a defamation suit filed by a poet here.

4,Ousted families' protest gets political support,"PATHANKOT: Left homeless in this cold weather after their huts were razed on Wednesday by the Pathankot Improvement Trust authorities, the affected families have taken to the streets against the high-handedness of the authorities to oust them from the site where they had been putting up for the last 15 years.

Though the Pathankot MC vice-president, Manjit Singh, was first to come out in their support, but he failed to protest vehemently on Wednesday. But former BJP MLA from Narot Mehra Ram Lal has thrown his weight behind the protesters.

He joined the homeless in raising slogans against SDM Punit Goyal, SP Manminder Singh and the Amarinder government for dislodging them from the Trust land, while the liquor vend near Dhangu Peer was left untouched.

Castigating the Congress for rendering more than 100 families homeless, Ram Lal alleged that the administration had left them shelterless on the pretext of cleaning the city for President Abdul Kalam''s visit on November 30, 2003.

The new deputy commissioner, Harjit Singh, remained busy reviewing arrangements for the first citizen''s visit. The authorities are praying that no protest would mar Kalam''s visit.

While the Improvement Trust authorities are telling them that they cannot allot plots to all of them, it is most likely that the BJP leaders will extend support to them, giving a political hue to the issue.

To the protesters'' charge that the vend was not removed due to some ""understanding"" between the police and IT authorities, the concerned authorities maintain that the owner of the vend had obtained a stay against vacating the land from the high court.

However, on Friday, Ram Lal rubbished this saying that no stay had been granted to the liquor vend. In fact, he sought a high-level probe into the mushrooming of illegal liquor vends in the city.

5,I&B's basic instinct: TV for U-18s,"NEW DELHI: Pay TV broadcasters say they can weather the â€˜â€˜totally ridiculousâ€™â€™ decree from I&B minister Ravi Shankar Prasad that only content worthy of a U certificate (OK for those under 18) should be dished out to 40 million cable TV homes.

In other words, the latest James Bond movie or a much-aired Basic Instinct â€” and even risque Mariah Carey music videos are out. â€˜â€˜We are enforcing the programme code in which any TV programme for public should be viewable by an under-18 year old,â€™â€™ said an I&B ministry official.

The immediate impact will be on movie (Star Movies, HBO, AXN), music (Channel V, MTV, B4U, ETC), and fashion channels (Trendz, FTV). It also rings the death-knell for adult-theme movies shown in many of the channels in the late-night slot. â€˜â€˜I am not clear whether Prasadâ€™s diktat is applicable to scantily-clad animation as well,â€™â€™ jokes a broadcaster.

In terms of revenue, the movie channels will be hit hard as they will now have to seek Censor Board certification in advance for all movies. On an average, over 200 movies are released every year via these channels.

This will also mean lots more work for the I&B ministry and the censor board, which have received many complaints from women groups and NGOs irked by the oomph content in cable TV. Officially, broadcasters maintained that they will abide by any government regulation. Star India spokesperson said the programmes they beam are whetted. â€˜â€˜Our standards and practices division censors content even in U rated movies if it is not in good taste,â€™â€™ a Star official said.

Interestingly, under the current Cable TV Act, the local cable operator is responsible for violation in programme code by channels. This is the first time the government is moving towards controlling content and making broadcasters responsible for what they beam.

6,No fresh violence in Assam,"GUWAHATI: No incidents of anti-Bihari violence were reported in Assam for the second consecutive day on Friday, though tight security was still in place, particularly in view of the ULFA observing November 28 as the Black Day.

The sources said the banned outfit had the tendency to strike after a lull to catch people off guard which is why the government was taking no chances with its security arrangements. Meanwhile, in the worst-affected Tinsukia district, schools, colleges and other educational institutions functioned normally since they reopened on Thursday with curfew relaxed for 12 hours from 6am to 6pm.

Curfew was also relaxed during the day in 11 other towns. The ULFA has been observing Nov 28 as Black Day since 1990 when Presidentâ€™s rule was imposed in the state and the Army operation â€˜Bajrangâ€™ was launched against the outfit.

7,British scholar lashes out at protest culture,"KOLKATA: The trend among religions to shun piety and take up more â€˜protestantâ€™ forms is giving rise to fundamentalism in the world, feels Professor Francis Robinson, president of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

According to him, religious reformers in the 20th century have laid lesser stress on renunciation and encouraged â€˜this worldlyâ€™ faith rather than an â€˜other worldlyâ€™ one.

Robinson was delivering the keynote address at the inaugural session of a twoday seminar on Fundamentalism: Tolerance and Indiaâ€™s Heritage at The Asiatic Society in Kolkata.

â€œThe world has witnessed rejection of secular nationalism by a large section of the population in the last 30 years. Militancy has increased not only in Islam but also in other religions like Buddhism, Sikhism and Hinduism. Secularists like Nehru and Nasser have been forgotten and national progress has come to a halt. The anguish expressed by scholars in India, as their ambitions get trampled upon, is painful,â€� Robinson remarked.

According to him, politics of religion has led to sectarianism which infringes on the policy of tolerance.

One of the issues that has not been given due importance is the changes brought about in religions in the last few decades.

â€œThere is stress on individual actions to achieve salvation. For example, there has been a stress on activities of early Islamic activists. Thousands of Madrasahs have come up and the Koran has been translated into a number of languages. With lack of assistance from the state, there is an effort to grab political power and remove corrupting influences. There is a shift from social movement to an individualistic approach,â€� he said.

Robinson, however, noted that the changes had also brought about some development.

â€œRespect for individuals has grown. People look towards individual performances in schools and colleges.

8,Engineers paralyse govt offices,"PATNA: Members of the coordination committee of all the five factions of the Engineering Association and Engineering Services Association of the state gheraoed Vikas Bhawan (new secretariat) on Friday and completely paralysed the functioning of different government departments housed there on the third day of their agitation in protest against non-recovery of two kidnapped engineers.

They had paralysed the functioning of the technical secretariat on Thursday, which is also known as Visveshwaraya Bhawan. How they were allowed to enter the prohibited zone by the police and paralyse the secretariat is surprising, since members of other service organisations are not allowed to cross the Hartali Chowk on Bailey Road and R-block Crossing.

At the fourth phase of agitation, they will paralyse the functioning of Vidyut Bhawan. If the kidnapped engineers, Dinesh Kumar Choudhary and Harendra Dubey, of the water resources department are not recovered from the captors, they will paralyse the wheels of development in the entire state on Sunday, said Bihar Engineering Services Association general secretary Aditya Narain Jha ""Anal"".

The coordination committee did not rule out the possibility of disruption of power and water supply. The two engineers had been kidnapped on November 13. The characteristic of Friday''s agitation was that although by applying force policemen succeeded in getting the main gate of Vikas Bhawan opened none of the employees entered the gate to join their duties in support of agitating engineers, claimed Anal.

The departments, which could not function on Friday, were: Health, medical education, HRD, minor irrigation, animal husbandry, fisheries, cooperative, registration and jail along with bank and treasury housed in Vikas Bhawan. While condemning the kidnapping incident, which is the burning example of the collapse of the law and order situation of the state, speakers demanded resignation from the state government for its failure to give protection to the people in general and service-holders in particular.

Bihar State Gazetted Employees'' Federation, Tripathi and Gope factions of the Non-gazetted Employees'' Federation, Secretariat Service Association, Secretariat Samyukta Morcha Sangh and Bharatiya Majdoor Sangh (BMS) also supported the agitation.

9,Assam govt ensures safety for truckers,"PATNA: The government of Assam in a statement claimed that it had taken several measures to ensure truck movement in the state.

The claim is being made in the wake of the call by bodies like the Bihar Motor Transport Federation about not sending their drivers to Assam.

The food and civil supplies commissioner, government of Assam, A K Singh stressed that the situation in Assam is back to normal and no fresh incidents involving the Hindi-speaking people has been reported.

â€œAssam government has made tight security arrangements at both entry points - Seirampur check gate in Kokrajhar district and Chaglia check post in Dhubri districtâ€�, Singh said in a fax message sent to Times News Network.

He said that truck movement is normal and there are no stranded trucks there at present.

â€œPolice escorts may be provided to convoys of trucks moving into Assam to ensure their safe passage though sensitive areas as and when neededâ€�, Singh said.

He said that DMs and SPs have been given strict instructions to ensure safety of drivers and trucks coming into Assam and arrange prompt unloading of incoming trucks and giving security to labour as well.

Singh said that a large number of Hindi-speaking people were dependent on truck movement into Assam for their livelihood for example unloading, loading, local transport he said.

Any disruption of truck movement to Assam will cause losses to them, he added.

Incidentally, truckers of Bihar had threatened to block road route to Assam if violence against Bihari continues.

10,"Tribals clash in Assam, five killed","DIPHU (ASSAM): Five Karbis were killed and several others injured when a group of Kuki tribes attacked two Karbi villages in central Assam''s Karbi Anglong district and set ablaze 85 houses in the wee hours on Saturday.

District Deputy Commissioner Anurag Goel said the Kukis came to the villages, Rongkimi and Jelangso, under Bokajan police station and set the houses on fire killing the five persons on the spot.

The Karbis were fleeing the area for safer sanctuaries, Goel said.

The incident, which occured around 3.30 am, is the latest in the ongoing ethnic clashes between the two tribes since October last.

The Army which was deployed this month in the district following the clashes, had moved to the Bokajan area only on Friday midnight.

11,Polls not to predict general elections,"NEW DELHI: Come Monday, an electorate of 94 million voters will once again suspend disbelief and entrust their fate to a new set of political leaders in the states of Delhi, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. The North-eastern state of Mizoram went to the polls a week earlier, on November 20.

The campaign has been a messy potage of charges and counter-charges on corruption, lack of governance, development work, broken promises of earlier elections, Ayodhya, Judeo, banning cow slaughter, and above all, appeals for support based on caste.

The outcome is likely to be a bit of a conundrum for those looking for pointers to next yearâ€™s Lok Sabha general elections.

Averaging out opinion polls conducted by India Today, Outlook, Zee and The Week, it appears that the Congress is set to retain the Rajasthan Assembly, but lose Madhya Pradesh.

In Chattisgarh, the elections is, too, narrowly poised to call, and in Delhi it is a Congress sweep, though a TIMESPOLL poll published on Saturday says that it could be a narrower affair than that predicted by other polls.

Given the spectacular failure of polls to predict Jayalalithaaâ€™s massive victory last year, pollsters are cautious.

But what is striking about the predictions is the correlation between the perception of the chief ministerial candidate and the prospects for the party.

In Delhi for example, TIMESPOLLâ€™s predictions are matched by Dixitâ€™s (45 per cent) higher rating over BJP rival Khurana (42 per cent) for the choice of chief minister.

In Rajasthan, Outlook has Ghelot (43 percent) ahead of Vasundhara Raje (32) as the chief minister of choice. In MP, veteran Diggy Raja trails maverick Uma Bharti, 28 per cent to 38.

Incumbency should have weighed heavily on the Congress, yet these predictions suggest that the BJP may win only one, or possibly two of the four legislative assemblies, (not counting Mizoram).

Does that say something about the prospects of next yearâ€™s general elections ? Probably not. State assembly elections are about local issues and politics.

The ones going to the polls on Monday are largely bipolar, that is, politics is a BJP versus Congress affair, though the BSP is vying to become a new factor in

Madhya Pradesh.

It is almost certain, however, that the next government at the Centre will also be a coalition where the TDP, AIADMK, Samajwadi Party, the Left and the BSP will play a substantial role.

The key to forming the government at the Centre will be the ability to stitch up a coalition, and there the BJP retains a clear advantge.

12,New govt in Kerala possible sans LDF: CPI-M,"KOLLAM: CPI-M leader V S Achuthanandan on Saturday said possibility of formation of an alternative government in Kerala without support of opposition LDF could not be ruled out in the present political circumstances.

Such a move from within the UDF, as had happened in 1995, was still a possible option, he told a meet-the-press programme here this evening.

The leader of opposition in the state assembly said the LDF was still ready to lend support to Karunakaran in his efforts to unseat Antony.

Meanwhile, former Chief Minister and CPI leader P K Vasudevan Nair said his party would have no truck with Congress as long as it followed the present economic policies.

The Left Democratic Front (LDF) would come to power only with people''s mandate, he said.
