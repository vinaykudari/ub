0,India doesn't rule out LoC as international border,"NEW DELHI: The US and the UK are keen that India and Pakistan agree to converting the Line of Control (LoC) into the international border (IB) between the two countries. This could be the only compromise formula which can end the Kashmir dispute, they feel.

In a shift from its earlier position, the Vajpayee government is not against discussing the proposal, once talks with Pakistan begin.

Though this issue did not come up as part of any of the structured discussions that Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani had with US president George W Bush or British prime minister Tony Blair, or any other leader, during his recent visit to Washington and London, the proposal for conversion of the LoC into the IB has been part of informal diplomatic interactions.

American diplomats have been interacting on the proposal informally, with Indian ambassador to the US, Lalit Mansingh. Similarly, they are also interacting with Pakistan''s ambassador to the US, Jehangir Qazi. Both Mansingh and Qazi have informed their respective authorities about the US view on the issue.

Before leaving for Washington, US ambassador Robert Blackwill discussed the proposal with Advani on several occasions. There has been a change of position on the Indian side from its rigid stand â€” Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir must be returned to India. Now the Vajpayee government is ready to discuss the proposal, say sources in the government.

According to a senior official, there is no problem in discussing the proposal, ""but first the bridge must be in view before the question of crossing it arises.""

Since India''s present position is that PoK must be returned, and Pakistan insists that entire Kashmir region should be handed over to them, the only way to end the deadlock would be by converting the LoC to IB. That would amount to India giving up its claim on PoK.

But, Pakistan is not as forthcoming on this proposal as India, sources say. At informal discussions on the issue, Islamabad has demanded that if the LoC is converted into the IB, the Doda region in Kashmir must go to Pakistan.

India feels that Pakistan is going for this line of bargaining because it does not want the LoC to be converted to IB since that would put an end to the Kashmir issue without Pakistan gaining anything, as PoK is already theirs. That would create problems for Pakistan''s domestic politics.

1,BSP minister rushes to the rescue of auto-lifter,"LUCKNOW: When a minister in the state government calls the police to help an arrested mafia don, it no longer makes a news as such incidents are common with the speedy criminalisation of politics.

But when a minister hounds senior police officials to rescue a listed thief who once carried a cash reward of Rs 10,000 on his head, accusing the men in uniform of making a â€œcriminalâ€� out of an innocent, it surely did made news.

It happened on Saturday morning when the special team of SP West intercepted a youth riding a Hero Honda motorcycle near Bans Mandi. He was brought to the local Naka police station when he failed to produce the registration papers of the vehicle. Here one of the constables identified him as Praveen Verma, a resident of Priyadarshni Colony.

With a series of criminal cases pending against him, Praveen once carried a cash reward of Rs 10,000 on his head till he went to jail and was released recently. Interrogation revealed that the motorcycle recovered from his possession was lifted from outside Indira Bhawan on May 24 and a case was lodged in connection with the incident with the local Hazratganj police station.

Barely had the police begun interrogating Praveen for his role in other similar cases when a BSP minister in the Mayawati cabinet came to his rescue. Contacting senior police officials, the minister gave a dressing down to the officials accusing them of making a criminal out of an innocent man. Had it not been for a few journalists who came to know about the arrest of Praveen, the police officials might have let him off the hook. But finally he had to be arrested for auto-lifting and send to jail.

3,Foreign airline to increase cargo flights,"KOLKATA: Just hours before Alitalia Cargoâ€™s maiden flight to the city, officials of the freighter division of the Italian flag carrier said they were working on plans to increase the frequency of cargo service to twice a week.

The first Alitalia cargo flight to the city landed at the NSCB cargo terminal on Saturday morning and picked up 35 tonnes of export goods before flying off non-stop to Milan. â€œItâ€™s great! Weâ€™ve had to close our bookings even before the first flight arrived despite the on-going strike by cargo employees at Kolkata airport,â€� said Nobel Vaz, general manager of Alitalia Cargo for India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Maldives.â€œ

We should have the second flight in place in a couple of months. Though the exact date hasnâ€™t been decided yet, weâ€™ve decided to fly in and out every Tuesday,â€� Vaz said, adding that export orders from Kolkata was good enough to justify an additional flight. At present, Lufthansa is the only other European airline to fly a cargo aircraft to Kolkata. These apart, the rest of the goods are transported in passenger carriers of British Airways, Singapore Airlines, Thai Airways, Royal Jordanian, Royal Brunei, Bangladesh Biman, Druk Air and Indian Airlines flights to Bangkok and Yangon.

Domestic carriers like IA, Jet Airways and Air Sahara also carry small quantities of cargo to Delhi and Mumbai for reloading in international carriers. â€œWhatâ€™s happened in Kolkata is a peculiar phenomenon. Though export hasnâ€™t grown appreciably with some months even showing negative growth, there is a demand due to lack of capacity as several airlines have pulled out in the past.We have therefore, flown in to fill the void,â€� the official said.

Currently, the export basket from Kolkata comprises leather and leather goods, apparels, engineering goods, pharmaceuticals, mica, jute products and handicrafts. Vinod Seth, managing director of Allied Aviation, the agents for the freighter in the city, believes there is tremendous scope for export of perishables. At present, Alitalia Cargo has nine freighters out of Delhi, two out of Mumbai, three out of Chennai and one out of Dhaka.

4,State mulls law to control highways,"HYDERABAD: The Andhra Pradesh Road Safety Authority is planning to bring in a law similar to that of the Control of National Highways (Land and Traffic) Act, 2003 introduced by the Union government.

The central act seeks to establish highway administrations and authorise its officers to enforce the provisions of the act. It also seeks to establish tribunals for hearing appeals against the orders of the highway administrations.

It also provides for prevention of unauthorised occupation of highway land and removal of encroachments, control of access points to the national highways, regulation of different types of traffic permitted on the highways, control of use of road land for public utilities and drains besides issue of licences or lease deeds for temporary use of the national highways.

Official sources in AP Road Safety Authority told The Times of India that the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) had requested the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) some time back to provide manpower for highway patrolling and administration.

The CISF had accepted the proposal and decided to raise 12 battalions as the NHAI had offered to pay Rs 230 crore per annum as hiring charges. However, the pilot project between New Delhi-Jaipur met with resistance as the Rajasthan government objected for the intervention by the central agency, sources said.

Regulation of traffic and crime control are state subjects and the Centre cannot intervene, sources said.

Even as the Centre has temporarily suspended its plans to go ahead with enforcing the law following Rajasthan experience, the AP Road Safety Authority is considering introduction of a similar law for effective regulation of traffic and control crime on national highways.

AP Road Safety Authority director general S R Sukumara said that he was studying the central act and a decision would be taken soon in this connection. Discussions with officials of related departments will beheld in this connection, he said.

5,CM will lead all-party team to President,"BANGALORE: Chief minister Krishna will lead an allparty delegation to meet President Kalam in New Delhi on June 24 to explain the stateâ€™s stand on the controversial Chitravati barrage project in Kolar district.

Water resources minister H.K. Patil told reporters here on Saturday that the visit is necessitated by Andhra Pradesh blowing the controversy out of proportion.

â€œAs of now, our intention is to meet the President and apprise him of the situation. A decision on meeting the Prime Minister is not on our agenda for the moment,â€™â€™ he added. Floor leaders of all parties in both Houses of Karnataka legislature would accompany the chief minister.

â€œWe will only make presentation of our case. We might also highlight some of the illegal projects undertaken by Andhra Pradesh along the border,â€™â€™ he said.

The Central Water Commission, which recently sent its representative to study the Chitravati barrage project, was yet to intimate the government on its decision.

Ananth Kumar sore: Union minister Ananth Kumar is cut up with the government for not seeking his assistance in finding a solution to the Chitravati controversy.

â€œThe Karnataka government has come to my doorstep whenever it encountered problems, be it Cauvery or in the Krishna basin. But they have not approached me now,â€™â€™ Kumar told reporters at a function of state BJP womenâ€™s wing here on Saturday.

Kumar said he would have arranged a meeting with either the President or PM. â€œEven now, when I go to Delhi, I will speak to the PM,â€™â€™ he added.

6,Best Bakery & Lal Akhada cases: Coincidence or quid pro quo?,"VADODARA: These are two cases with a striking similarity. And legal circles in Vadodara are agog with speculation on whether the trend of witnesses turning hostile in the court are in any way linked.

In one event, it is the Hindu witnesses in a murder case withdrawing their statements made against the accused who is a notorious municipal councillor. In the other, it is a BJP MLA who is offering protection to Muslim witnesses of one of the worst communal massacres during the riots last year.

Is this a quid pro quo? Thatâ€™s the question haunting those closely following the Best Bakery carnage and the murder of Pankaj Chouhan in the infamous Lal Akhada murder case.

Both the cases seem to be following the same pattern with witnesses steadily turning hostile and an interesting drama enacted outside the court rooms as well.

The first and the most talkedabout case that came on trial was that of the Best Bakery carnage. To the surprise of many, the key witness in the case and the complainant Zahira Shaikh herself turned hostile.

Interestingly, the day on which Zahira appeared in the court, BJP MLA Madhu Shrivastav, a strongman of Waghodia, was accompanying her to the court.

The sight of Shrivastav accompanying Zahira after the hearing had come as a surprise to many. Later, when mediapersons tried to speak to Zahira, it was Shrivastav who intervened and prevented them. He said, â€œThe girl is upset and it is not proper to trouble herâ€�. The string of witnesses turning hostile then continued.

Zahira has since gone underground and her house on the Ajwa Road is mostly locked.

The neighbours too have been unable to throw any light on her whereabouts. The advocates and social workers who had championed her cause were tongue-tied.

Even the government pleader Raghuvir Pandya who has been pleading the case in the fast track court prefers to keep quiet on the issue. â€œI would not like to discuss the case, just let the trial get over,â€� is all he has to say.P arallel to the Best Bakery case, were the hearings of the Lal Akhada murder case, in which Vadodaraâ€™s independent municipal councillor Nisarhussain Abrar Hussain Saiyed alias Nisar Bapu is an accused along with his son Abidhussain. The duo are behind the bars as undertrials.

Almost identically, witnesses and â€˜panchsâ€™ who had given statements during the police investigations, started turning hostile. So much so, that even police constable Dilipsinh Parbatsinh turned hostile in the court. The constable had stated during police investigations that he had seen Nisar and other accused escape from the spot of crime in a Tata Estate vehicle.

However, in the court, the policeman said that he had not seen any of them. While the case was pending in the court, another drama involving Nisar took place in the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) during election of the mayor. Nisarâ€™s vote by the virtue of his being a councillor had become vital to the election with every single vote being counted.

Interestingly, Nisar took permission to attend the meeting, but did not do so eventually. The decision seems to have worked in the favour of the ruling BJP along with the absence of three Congress councillors. Dilip Kothari, believed to be very close to Nisar, too voted for the BJPâ€™s candidate for the mayoral post.

7,J&K witnessing new era of development: Governor,"JAMMU: Jammu and Kashmir Governor S K Sinha has said that a new era of progress and development had started dawning in the state indicating an apparent change in the mindset of the people in large.

Addressing the district officers at a meeting held at Rajouri and Poonch on Saturday, Sinha said that a people-friendly change in the socio-political horizons of the state was in the offing, which was visible through the organisation of historic events like Kheer Bhawani Mela and Amarnath Yatra.

The Governor observed that the people of the state had started feeling the presence of ""a better atmosphere"" for a happy and prosperous life.

About 50,000 devotees participated in the historic Kheer Bhawani Mela, which was an example of communal harmony and brotherhood and peaceful coexistence among different communities in the state, he said.

He further said that a peaceful Amarnath Yatra would disseminate a positive message not only in the state but all over the country.

Sinha while comparing the developmental scenario of the state in 1947 to this date said that the state had developed a lot during past years despite a long nightmare of proxy war which had adversely affected the state.

The Governor urged the officials to serve the people with a sense of devotion and dedication so that the aspiration of the people were fulfilled and democratic duties of a secular system were also performed in a better way.

The Governor underlined imperative need of joint efforts between the civil administration and the security forces in order to bring perfect harmony at all levels.

He said that various elements of security forces including Army, para-military forces and police should function in a complimentary manner for better services.
