2,Olive branch after bandh,"KOLKATA: Satisfied at the response from Fridayâ€™s Bangla Bandh, Trinamul Congress leader Mamata Banerjee announced that her party was ready to play a positive role in sorting out the problems faced by teachers, farmers and students in the state.

In fact, the party entrusted leader of Opposition Pankaj Bandyopadhyay to hold talks with the government on these issues.

â€œWe have not refused the chief ministerâ€™s invitation. We feel everyone should rise above politics to sort these things out. But threat and invitation for talks cannot go together,â€� Mamata told newspersons.

Describing the Bandh as a turning point, the Trinamul supremo said that it was also a red alert for the state government, besieged by financial cruch, to set its house in order.

â€œWe want the state government to stop wasteful expenditure and ensure that that development funds are not diverted,â€� Mamata said.

The Trinamul supremo is leaving for Delhi after being summoned by the Prime Minister on Friday. The impending presidential election is likely to figure in the discussion between the two leaders with the Trinamul already authorising the PM to decide on NDAâ€™s presidential nominee.Trinamulâ€™s departure from strident confrontation with the Left Front government to a more mellow regime of cooperation with the state government has raised eyebrows. Party insiders hint that the moderate elements, for once, have been able to push through their point of view.

Explaining the shift, member of Trinamul think tank Partha Chatterjee said that the strategy was to seize the initiative opened up by the chief ministerâ€™s letter on Thursday, at the same time marginalising the Congress to the extent possible.

Chatterjee also said that the bandh could be organised without much effort as some Left Front partners and even a section of the CPM were not too keen to oppose.

3,Mamata suffers heat stroke during bandh,"Time: 7.30 am: Bangla bandh is already one-and-a-half hours on its way. But didi is fast asleep in her house at Harish Chatterjee Street. She was awake as always till four in the morning. Not a soul in her house.

Harish Chatterjee Street, however, is as busy as ever. The shops are open. The Polson Bakery, opposite Mamataâ€™s house, is doing brisk business. So are the tea shops, eateries and the tiny workshops along the narrow, serpentine lane.

Banerjeeâ€™s brother Subrata (Ganesh) owns a hardware store just yards from her house. Surprisingly, this shop, too, is open. Is he opposing the bandh? â€œI will say nothing to reporters. You ask dada,â€� says Tapan Tripathy, an employee, who has himself plonked on the ownerâ€™s chair with his legs up on the table.

8.30 am: Trinamul Congress leaders Mukul Roy and Gautam Basu arrive at the Harish Chatterjee Street party office.

â€œThe bandh is total and peaceful,â€� they declare. There will be a rally at Hazra Road crossing, they inform. The telephone rings. The two leaders rush inside. Didi has woken up at nine.

9.30 am: Gariahat More wears a desolate look. Three state buses ply together, each carrying not more than 10 passengers. A private bus follows. It is half full.

At his Gariahat Road residence, mayor Subrata Mukherjee is in a pensive mood. â€œPeople donâ€™t like bandhs nowadays,â€� Mukherjee observes. â€œI will attend office today. Remember I am in charge of running the essential ser-vices.â€�

10.30 am: Harish Chatterjee Street. â€œMamata will not attend the rally. The bandh is already successful,â€� says Mukul Roy. Mamata walks out in mid-sentence and marches off with Sonali Guha by her side. Exactly 53 supporters join her. She wipes her face with her sari. The heat is unbearable.

Hazra Road. The michhil swells to about 500. Sudip Bandyopadhyay, Saugata Roy, Sobhandeb Chattopadhyay, Dinesh Trivedi and Subrata Bakshi join in. Pankaj Banerjee is absent. So are Subrata Mukherjee and other prominent leaders.

11.10 am: Jadubabur Bazar. Didi stops and sits on a stool. â€œI am not feeling well. The heat is too much,â€� she says. A scooter arrives. Mamata returns home. â€œShe has suddenly fallen ill. We told her to go home,â€� says Sobhandeb.

At Harish Chatterjee Street, an agitated Mukul Roy talks to Pankaj Banerjee over the phone, â€œShe suffered a heat stroke. Only by Godâ€™s grace she has survived. Remember. Only by Godâ€™s grace.â€�

4,PWG bandh in Jharkhand districts peaceful,"DALTONGANJ: The dawn-to-dusk bandh called by the outlawed People''s War Group in Garhwa, Palamu and Latehar districts of Jharkhand to protest the killing of four Naxalites, including a ""zonal commander"", on Friday evoked little response, official sources said.

They said all shops and major business establishments in Daltonganj, Garhwa and Latehar towns were open and vehicular traffic plied as usual and functioning in the state and central government offices was also normal.

Close vigil was being kept on the vital installations including property of railways, considered to be the main target of the ultra-outfits during their agitation, sources said.

DIG (Palamu range) Rajeev Kumar said the PWG Naxalites made an abortive bid to disrupt movement of Howrah-Jabalpur Shaktipunj Express at the Kumadih railway station on Garhwa Road-Barkakana section but they were chased away by the security personnel.

The transportation of minerals and forest products was also by and large unaffected, they claimed. A Special Task Force in Jharkhand on May 26 shot dead the four PWG activists, including its self-styled zonal commander Dadhichi Rai, near Bishrampur police station in Palamu.

5,"AIADMK, NCP’s votes vital in Prez polls","PATNA: The AIADMK of Jayalalitha and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) of Sharad Pawar hold key to the victory of the President in case the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) led by the BJP and the Opposition led by the Congress force elections, according to a rough estimate of votes in the electoral college consisting of the Lok Sabha, Rajya Sabha and state assembly members throughout the country.

Former Speaker of the Bihar assembly Radhanandan Jha, who has expertise in analysing voting patterns in the electoral college for the presidential elections, said the NDAâ€™s vote values in the electoral college had definite edge over the Opposition led by the Congress.

As per calculation of vote values in the electoral college throughout the country, the NDA has support of 5,26,714 votes, while the Opposition led by the Congress has support of 5,04,225 votes.

The value of votes of each member of Parliament is 708, while vote values of the members of state assemblies differ from state to state because of population and number of seats in respective state assemblies. The value of votes of each MLA in UP and Bihar is higher in comparison to smaller states in the country, Jha said.

Eminent constitutional expert Basudeva Prasad, said that the electoral college of the presidential election, is sharply divided over the presidential choice. â€œBut there must be a consensus.â€�

Jha said that among the ruling constituents, the BJP and allies had values of votes to the tune of 2,60,696, TDP-1,56,701, TMP-73,202 and BSP-36,117, totalling 5,26,716 votes. On the other hand, in the Opposition led by the Congress, the total vote value of votes is 5,04,225, with Congress 2,69,784, Left parties 85,563, Samajwadi Party 55,135, Rashtriya Janata Dal 33,033, others 35,027 and independents 25,683.

While the AIADMK has vote value of 44,880, NCP has vote value of 17,246. â€œIf both these parties, which continue to be indecisive, side with the Opposition then the opposition-sponsored candidate could win as in that case, the number of the opposition votes will go up to 5,67,251,â€� Jha said.

6,Ramai to hold rally on quota in judiciary,"PATNA: The Rashtriya Ambedkar Sena will hold an â€œAmbedkar Maharallyâ€� on June 9 to press its demand for more reservation in the judiciary.

Giving this information to mediapersons at his official residence here on Friday, Sena chief and Bihar minister Ramai Ram said all the appointments in the judiciary right from the lower judiciary to the Supreme Court should be made through a judicial service commission. He demanded implementation of the Karia Munda Committee report (1999-2000).

Ram said the reservation limit in the judicial service should be increased to 70 per cent. SCs, STs, OBCs and extremely backwards should be given 50 per cent reservation. There should be eight per cent reservation for caste Hindus coming from the economically poor category and 12 per cent for Muslims, he added.

Ram said the Sena will also hold a rally in New Delhi to press its demands.

7,Extortionists rule the roost in Danapur,"DANAPUR: Life has become miserable in Khagaul for those who want to construct a house or sell it. Unless a hefty amount as â€˜rangdariâ€™ tax is paid to the local goons, one is not supposed to do anything.

In the case of the FIRs being lodged with the local police, innocent and hapless people easily fall prey to the goonsâ€™ bullets.

Recently a retired teacher started constructing his house in Dalluchak locality under the Khagaul police station. Criminals harassed him for the â€˜rangdariâ€™ tax. Though a little amount was paid to the gun-toting goons of the locality, demand for more and more money kept on pouring in much to the chagrin of the teacher who all through lived a smiple and honest life.

Fed up with the tortune, he stopped the contruction work and left the place for good.

Same is the case of a railway employee who has constructed a house of his choice in the same locality. He has not been allowed to live there.

The reason is very simple. He did not pay â€˜rangdariâ€™ at the time of house building. As such, he will be given possession of the house on payment of handsome money as â€˜rangdariâ€™ tax.

The scared railway employee, thus, though it better to live in a rented house elsewhere. Police, too, did not come to his help, it is said.

A leading medical practitioner whose spouse is a doctor, too, is being constantly harassed for â€˜rangdariâ€™ tax. Though he has built his house in â€˜Garikhanaâ€™ mohalla, he dare not live in the newly-built house due to fear still lurking in the mind.

According to aggrieved citizens, â€˜rangdariâ€™ tax is being collected openly by the anti-social elements in the town and the demand varies from Rs 15,000 to Rs 50,000 each depending on the construction area of the house.

In the case of selling house or land particularly in Jamaluddinchak, Dalluchak, Garikhana, Mustafapur and other areas of the town, one has to part with five to ten per cent of the deal to the local goons, lest they become victimised by the extortionists, they said.

In Lakhnibigha area under the Khagaul police station which has of late turned into a hunting ground for extortionists, the modus operandi is different.

Here youths, mostly in their 20s, visit the site first and assess the valuation of the houses under construction.

They find out the names of the house owners and then they are approached to pay â€˜rangdariâ€™ tax. Connivance of the police in some of the cases is not ruled out.

8,Modi protests to CJ over Laloo’s presence,"PATNA: The presence of RJD supremo Laloo Prasad Yadav in the meeting of chief minister Rabri Devi and Patna High Court Chief Justice (CJ) Ravi S Dhavan on Thursday evening has snowballed into a controversy.

Leader of the opposition in the state assembly Sushil Kumar Modi, in a letter to the CJ on Friday, strongly objected to the presence of Laloo in the meeting. The meeting was held to discuss various issues relating to the judicial service including filling of the vacancies in the subordinate judiciary, establishment of a judicial training institute and implementation of the Shetti Commission recommendations.

â€œI was surprised to read in newspapers that Laloo Prasad Yadav was not only present in the meeting but also took an active part in it. We have come to know that the chief minister was a mute spectator while Laloo Prasad Yadav placed the state government point of view in the meeting on her behalf,â€� stated Modi in his letter. He said Laloo had to go to jail in connection with the fodder scam and had to resign as the chief minister of the state.

Modi stressed that the RJD chief has not been a minister or has held any administrative post for the last four years. He also pointed out that Laloo is out on bail granted by the Patna High Court. â€œIn these circumstances, if Laloo Prasad Yadav is present in any government meeting and actively participates in it, the judicial process is affected,â€� said Modi in the letter.

Modi said the entire country knows that Rabri Devi is the chief minister only for name sake and that it is actually Laloo who runs the government in Bihar. â€œBut Laloo Prasad Yadav still has not formally been present in any cabinet meeting in Bihar,â€� he maintained. Modi suggested that if the presence of Laloo was needed, the state government should have called the representatives of all political parties.

Modi said he was registering his protest because if this trend is not stopped, Laloo will start participating in cabinet meetings in future. He requested the CJ that since Laloo has apprised him of the views of his party on the problems facing the judiciary, a delegation of the BJP should also be allowed to meet and discuss the issue with him.

9,Automen seek increase in minimum fare,"HYDERABAD:With the hike in petrol and diesel prices, autorickshaw drivers are demanding that the minimum fare be increased from Rs 7 to Rs 10.

Addressing a press conference on Friday, president of the Autorickshaw Drivers Union, affiliated to the All India Trade Union Congress, P Nageshwar Rao, said the recent fuel price hike had badly affected the drivers who already are facing a lot of harassment by the government.

Rao alleged that the weights and measures department, in collusion with a few authorised mechanics, was allowing tampering of fare meters of a few autos but cases were being booked against many drivers.

In the past one week, the Road Transport Authority office, in collaboration with weights and measures department and police officials, had collected around Rs 5 lakh a day as fines.

He alleged that the government is finding fining of auto drivers an easy way to bridge the deficit in its budget and was exploiting this unorganised sector on which has over one lakh people survive.

He said the RTA is in know of at least 250 unauthorised mechanics who tamper with the meters, but is not acting against them. Cases were booked only against two such mechanics recently.

To highlight the plight of auto drivers, he said that the AITUC affiliated auto drivers would organise a demonstration in front of the weights and measures department office in the city on June 10.

11,BJP may go in for early polls in Gujarat,"NEW DELHI: The BJP on Saturday hinted at going in for early elections in Gujarat, a move vehemently opposed by the opposition parties.

""The situation in the state has witnessed tremendous improvement. While the elections are scheduled for February 2002, if the situation improves and the state Government and the party''s state unit decides on elections, we are ready for that,"" party spokesman Sunil Shastri told reporters here.

During the two-day meeting of the party''s central office bearers and Prabharis (state incharges) which concluded here on Saturday, party leaders expressed the view that the situation in the state in the wake of the post-Godhra communal violence has ""tremendously improved"" and the time was ripe to go to the electorate, party sources said.

In his address, Union Home Minister L K Advani also told the delegates that the state has returned to normalcy.

The party at its Goa national executive meeting had authorised Chief Minister Narendra Modi to go in for early polls, if necessary - a move opposed tooth and nail not only by the opposition but also some NDA allies.

The party also appeared in favour of fresh Assembly polls in Maharashtra, in the event of the NCP-Congress alliance failing to prove its majority in the House on June 13.

Asked whether the party favoured dissolution of the House, Shastri said, ""Let the picture become clear. The state Government has lost its majority and the Chief Minister should resign on moral grounds. The BJP-Sena combine will come into action once that happens."" He had earlier said that the saffron alliance would stake claim if the Democratic Front failed to prove its majority.

13,DVB staff want their old govt jobs,"NEW DELHI: It is not for the sake of old times, but most of the Delhi Vidyut Board staff wants to work for the state government.

As the DVB prepares to transfer 51 per cent share in power distribution to private players on July 1, a mad scramble has started among the existing staff to retain their positions in the government wing.

Sources said these employees prefer being in the government as they fear that corporate bosses in the private companies might demand efficiency and hard work.

The DVB is being divided into five companies with the three distribution companies (discoms) going to BSES (Bombay Suburban Electric Supply) and Tata Power and the state government to retain control on generation (genco) and transmission (transco) companies.

With the share transfer, about 18,000 DVB employees along with office property, buildings and the entire distribution network system would be shifted to the discoms. But sources said a large number of these employees are reluctant to work for the private sector.

Said an official: â€˜â€˜Working for private companies is more demanding than being under the government. The private companies demand efficiency, while one can get away with anything with the government. Many employees are trying to pull strings to retain their positions in the state- controlled genco and transco.â€™â€™

The south-west discom would be getting 7,100 DVB employees. The central-east discom would get 5,800 employees and about 5,200 employees would be transferred to north-northwest discom.

DVB chairman Jagdish Sagar said the board has decided on the fate of all employees up to the chief engineer level. He said the board would also be split up. â€˜â€˜Members of the board would be transferred to genco and transco and some would go to the state government,â€™â€™ he said.

For instance, the two members (technical) would go as managing directors of transco and genco. According to sources, the DVB chairman, member (administration) and member (finance) are likely to be inducted into the state government.

As the DVB wraps up on July 1, the existing offices would also cease to function. The DVBâ€™s Nehru Place head office would be handed over to south-west discom. The transco head office would be at Shakti Sadan in Rouse Avenue, while the genco office would operate from the Rajghat power plant.

Sagar said the DVB was in the process of splitting financial records among the five companies. He said the inter- company metering which would record the flow of electricity from genco to transco and subsequently to the three discoms is already in place.

Sagar said: â€˜â€˜Through these meters, each company would be billing the other. The genco would transfer power to transco which would sell it to discoms. The discoms will distribute power to the consumers.â€™â€™

This fact came to light during the launch of the â€œAIDS awareness campaign in 792 slums of the cityâ€� by the first lady of the state, Haripriya Rangarajan, at Sriramnagar on Friday.

The campaign is being taken up jointly by the Municipal Corporation of Hyderabad (MCH) and the Indian Red Cross Society (IRCS) to create awareness in slums and train 1,800 community workers to sensitise adolescents of the effects of AIDS.

As per the statistics available with the MCH, 2,751 HIV positive cases and 551 AIDS patients were detected in the city while 78 deaths were reported due to AIDS during 2000-2001 alone.

MCH commissioner Chitra Ramachandran said the medical and para-medical staff of India Population Project - VIII, slum development officers and community development officers, all belonging to MCH, will train high school students, adolescent girls, link volunteers, pregnant women and people living in slums.

The trained volunteers will go round in the designated slums to conduct awareness camps, Chitra Ramachandran said.

The feedback will be reviewed at the end of the month. Further course of action would be chalked out.

These awareness camps will be conducted in all the slums through out the year, she added.
