3,Amnesty exhorts Modi govt to bring culprits to justice,"new delhi: in a report strongly critical of the gujarat administration, amnesty international has cautioned that the narendra modi governmentâ€™s failure to arrest and prosecute those guilty of heinous crimes in the state could lead to further violence. in a report detailing the two main areas of immediate concern, the international human rights organisation has said that unless the culprits were brought to justice, other might feel free to repeat the acts. the expectation of immunity from prosecution, may, in fact, have been a cause for the open, systematic and brutal nature of the violence in gujarat, the report states. questioning the legitimacy of the enquiry by a judicial commission appointed by the state government, amnesty has said the inquiry must be carried out by an agency appointed by the centre since the gujarat government and its agencies were themselves suspected of culpability in the violence. focussing on the action taken by the government following the acts of violence and the displacement of people, amnesty points out that little has been done to ensure the safety, well-being and rehabilitation of the displaced. the absence of the authorities, the inadequacy of food, shelter and medical help, have been detailed as has the lack of security to survivors. amnesty refers to reports of attacks on camps as well as on survivors attempting to return to their homes.the report also documents clearly the systematic and discriminatory violence targeted against muslims and the discriminatory approach in providing relief subsequently. the organisation has drawn attention to the forthcoming gram panchayat elections on april 7 and the fact that the displaced will not be able to exercise their right to vote in the absence of documents of identity. setting out restitution, compensation, rehabilitation and guarantees of non-repetition as benchmarks, the report concludes by saying that until the government of gujarat shows a clear political will to move in this direction, brutal human rights violations are likely to continue.

4,MLAs demand say in selection of rural roads,"patna: panchayati raj minister upendra prasad verma said on wednesday that the constitution does not provide for voting rights to legislators in selection of various road projects by district boards and hence there is no question of the state government moving a bill to this effect in the assembly. verma said the union rural development ministry has informed the state government that local mps would be the chairmen of the committees to be constituted by district boards to select roads under the pmâ€™s rural road scheme. earlier, raising the issue during the zero hour, prem kumar (bjp) said legislators should also be given voting rights in the matter as the mps have already been given such rights. members cutting across the party lines supported kumarâ€™s demand. but rjd president laloo prasad yadav supported the governmentâ€™s stand, saying that top government officials and the chief ministerâ€™s principal secretary mukund prasad have told him that the constitution does not provide for it. he, however, said the government is not at all opposed to the idea. the speaker asked verma to seek the opinion of legal experts on the matter and inform the legislators accordingly. verma agreed to do this. later on, the house passed a resolution demanding from the centre equal rights for mps and mlas in the selection of projects under the rural development schemes. the resolution was moved by cpi-ml(nd) member umadhar prasad singh.

5,New excise policy being formulated: Tiwary,"patna: excise minister shivanand tiwary on wednesday said that the finance department had set the revenue target to be collected without consulting the excise department. he said the excise department had failed to achieve the revenue collection target during the last financial year. tiwary said he had registered his strong objection to the manner in which the finance department had fixed the annual revenue target for his department. he had written a strong letter to finance commissioner in this regard. tiwary was replying to a short-notice question of samata party member maheshwar singh in the state assembly. he said the excise department had failed to settle 569 liquor shops, but hastened to clarify that it had not caused any revenue loss. tiwary told the house that the department had initiated steps to formulate a new excise policy that will end the system of leaving some liquor shops unsettled every year. the excise minister said that despite the â€œunrealistic targetâ€�, the revenue collection during 2001-2002 was much better than the previous year. he said the revenue collection had come down due to bifurcation of the state leading to the creation of jharkhand in november, 2000. senior rjd member and former finance minister shankar prasad tekriwal, joining the issue with tiwary, said targets for the revenue generating departments had been fixed by the chief secretary in consultation with the officials of the departments concerned. tiwary, however, said that the department needed to streamline its licence fee collection system, which was not up to the mark in the last financial year. the department had initiated action against five excise officials allegedly responsible for it. samata member singh had claimed that the government had suffered a loss of rs 16.46 crore due to non-settlement of hundreds of liquor shops. the leader of opposition in the state assembly, sushil kumar modi, demanded a house committee probe into the matter.

6,Tehelka picks holes in govt transcripts,"new delhi: after the government transcribed the unedited tehelka tapes for more than a month under the direct supervision of the justice k venkataswami commission, it was told that there were many loopholes in the transcript. on tuesday, as the commission resumed its sitting to cross-examine five witnesses, tehelka counsel siddharth luthra pointed out that in five tapes â€” numbers 72, 73, 80, 50 and 9 â€” â€˜â€˜important portion of the conversation either had been deliberately not transcribed or omitted by the transcribers of the ministries provided by the union.â€™â€™ luthra pointed out that â€˜â€˜the transcripts also do not bear the counter numbers or indication to show change of venue/meeting which are not only germane but also necessary for the just adjudication of the matterâ€™â€™. â€˜â€˜the purpose of transcribing the tapes again was to obviate any difficulty,â€™â€™ luthra argued. at this point, justice venkataswami asked luthra if this discrepancy will have any bearing on the examination of witnesses which was to take place. â€˜â€˜yes, because we do not know what all is there about the witnesses to be examined today,â€™â€™ luthra answered. replying to luthraâ€™s objection, additional solicitor-general kirit rawal made two suggestions: â€˜â€˜let the examination of satnam singh, a serving army officer, continue today. meanwhile, we will go through the transcript to find out more inaccuracies. accuracy cannot be compromised.â€™â€™ luthra asked the commission to defer all examination till wednesday. â€˜â€˜right now, we have found mistakes in portions relating to gopal pacherwal, who is to be examined today. we do not know what is there in satnam singhâ€™s portion. it has to be examined,â€™â€™ he submitted.

7,CAG indicts govt for tardy relief work,"gandhinagar: the comptroller and auditor general of india report, released here on wednesday, has indicted the gujarat government for the slow pace of relief and rehabilitation (r&r) work in the period aftermath of the january 26 earthquake last year. the cag says, it has found, out of the unspent funds of rs 483.16 crore between january 26 and october 1, 2001, ""an amount of rs 112.24 crore was lying in various bank accounts of district collectors and ddos."" this despite the fact that the state got huge funds from the adb, the world bank and the centre. the gujarat state disaster management authority, formed to carry out r&r, ""kept rs 325.32 crore and rs 45.6 crore in fixed deposit and current account respectively... rs 112.24 crore remained in pipeline and rs 370.92 crore remained idle with the gsdma"", the cag said, adding, ""though the gsdma was functional, all the relief works were actually carried out by the commissioner of relief directly... the gsdma did not maintain any record to monitor physical financial progress of relief activities."" on irregularities, the cag said, ""the immediate relief to the victims was delayed in several cases up to seven months, and cash doles and assistance were paid in excess by rs 31 crore in test-checked talukas. and, 97,000 farmers' kits worth rs 24.28 crore were bought by the director of agriculture in august 2001 without inviting competitive tenders."" the cag report was released on the last day of the assembly session, as was done last year, to avoid embarrassment in the house. insisting on the need to monitor r&r work, the cag said, ""though adequate funds were available, pace of reconstruction of damaged schools and classrooms was very slow. adequate controls were not in place over purchase of materials. as the accounts of materials donated by other countries were not maintained, there was unnecessary purchase of similar material, besides theft and malpractice in distribution of such material."" the cag refers to the former finance minister vajubhai vala for sanctioning 'unnecessary extra expenditure' worth rs 48.51 crore on canal lining work of the kakrapar left bank main canal and its branch canals in south gujarat. the finance department did not recommend the proposal of 'acceptance of higher rates', yet vala overruled its suggestion on the 'untenable argument' that higher rates than those in the bids were necessary as 'the work was to be executed in a short time'. the cag, which indicted former cm keshubhai patel for making his personal tour official during 1998-99 in the last year's report, this time said, ""irregularities and violation of rules continued during 2000-01."" it particularly criticises industries minister suresh mehta who failed to provide records related to foreign travel to washington during september 1998 even, though he was called to do that by september 2001. the cag says, in several cases, 'procedure and guidelines of the central government or the state government were not followed'. in several cases, orders issued by the state government did not indicate reference to sanction issued by the centre, political clearance from the ministry of external affairs was not available, foreign exchange was drawn without obtaining sanction of the ministry of finance, and daily allowance was drawn in disregard of central instructions. referring to irregularities in the forests and environment department, the cag found that 95 per cent of the industrial units in the state as functioning without consent under the air act, with the gujarat pollution control board (gpcb) has 'no knowledge about the extent of pollution caused by these units'. further, the gpcb has not prepared a 'comprehensive programme and plan for prevention, control or abatement of air pollution as required'. the cag says, '92 per cent industrial units in hazardous waste generating sector were functioning without authorisation from the gpcb. several cases of injury, damage to public health due to exposure to hazardous waste were reported from vadodara and vapi'. then, only 30 industrial units had the facility of incinerator for disposal of hazardous waste. and, though 3,000 units were granted authorisation under hazardous waste rules, only 2,000 had the facility of safe disposal sites.

8,Haryana govt plans crop diversification,"chandigarh: haryana agriculture department has formulated an action plan for diverting areas from paddy cultivation to oilseeds and pulses during kharif-2002. this was revealed by financial commissioner and secretary (agriculture) naseem ahmed while presiding over a meeting of the field officers of his department. he said that the action plan had been drawn for expanding areas under groundnut, sesame, soyabean, moong, moth and arhar. this plan envisages bringing about 5,000 hectares under groundnut, 10,000 hectares under sesame,1000 hectares under soyabean, 27,000 hectares under moong, urd and moth and 35,000 hectares under arhar. the pulses and oilseeds had been particularly chosen for diversification keeping in view the shortage of these commodities in the domestic market, naseem ahmed added. ahmed further stated that the arrangements for ensuring the availability of seeds of recommended varieties for these crops had also been finalised and a campaign would be launched during the ensuing kharif season to achieve the targets fixed in the action plan. participating in the deliberations, director, agriculture, rajeev arora said that the diversification of crops would be a continuous process and in order to ensure the availability of seeds on a regular basis, the seed production programme, undertaken by the haryana seed development coprporation and other agencies, would be made keeping in view the total seed requirement for the purpose. this action plan for diversification assumes significance in the light of the increasing global competition even in the farm sector due to wto,and the central governmentâ€™s directions to state governments to ensure gradual shifting from the wheat-paddy pattern of cropping. farm experts believe that agricultural diversification will not only help the farming community to augment their income, but also reduce the risk factor which is generally very high in case of their dependence largely on two crops.

9,"Muslim moderates, hardliners clash at symposium","mumbai: a symposium on â€˜police and minoritiesâ€™ at the anjuman-i-islam school here on tuesday degenerated into a confrontation between the moderates and the hardliners in the muslim community. things turned ugly when a section of the audience took offence at the way the president of anjumani-islam, ishaq jamkhanawala, who was chairing the seminar, admonished a questioner. asked what the community ought to do to ensure that it could live with dignity in india, mr jamkhanawala, a moderate, said education was the only way out, and then lashed out against the fundamentalists, whom he accused of keeping the muslims backward. a pandemonium broke out as several in the audience objected to the tone and tenor of mr jamkhanawalaâ€™s reply. hardly had the dust settled down, when abu asim azmi, city unit president of the samajwadi party, got up to say that his sympathies were with the uneducated muslims who rose to the defence of the religion when mosques were attacked rather than the educated elite who restricted themselves to statements. by this time, the atmosphere was no longer conducive to a reasoned debate and mr jamkhanawalaâ€™s view that muslims ought to use democratic means of protest, such as articles in newspapers and seminars, went unheard. several youngsters who had come from far-off places such as bhiwandi and mumbra echoed mr azmi, who said that the police were not allowing them to vent their feelings in public and had even disallowed a fund collection rally for the victims of the gujarat violence. however, the first discordant note in the seminar came when s.m. syed, additional police commissioner for south mumbai, walked out of the seminar along with zonal deputy police commissioner ashok kamte in protest against retired high court judge s.m. daudâ€™s comment that even a 25 per cent reservation for muslims in the police would not help as the police force was â€œcorrupt and was a tool in the hands of the oppressorsâ€™â€™. mr jamkhanawala tried to salvage the situation by clarifying that it was mr daudâ€™s personal opinion and that he had the right to express it in a democracy, but it failed to placate mr syed, who left with mr kamte after politely making his point. after their departure, speakers denounced the police and mr jamkhanawla also criticised them for taking the easy way out of answering difficult questions. â€œwe muslims are called terrorists, pakistanis and all sorts of names by policemen, but can we stage a walkout?â€™â€™ asked farid batatawala of the muslim front. according to him, compliance with illegal orders was also a form of corruption and that was what mr daud had implied. earlier, mr daud had said that the indian police would always side with the dominant power or ruling party until and unless the force was insulated from political interference. the retired judge had also said that pakistan was the greatest enemy of the indian muslims and that india should have deported muslim fundamentalists to pakistan after the partition.

10,Mango farmers ripen plans for fest,"mumbai: mango farmers of ratnagiri and sindhudurg, nongovernmental bodies and the maharashtra government have ripened plans for a project, which, at least on the blueprint, looks sweeter than the alphonso. along with other institutions and individuals, they plan to kickstart a mango movement on the lines of the immensely successful grape and pomegranate cooperative ventures of western and northern maharashtra with a four-day mega mango festival in mumbai on may 3-6. on these four days, farmers from the two best mango producing districts of the state, home to the celebrity crop alphonso, will exhibit and sell their produce at the bandra reclamation. for the first time, there will be no middlemen, who usually reap half the returns from sales. the untouchably expensive mangoes will suddenly come cheaper to the man with a sore month-end, and in terms of quality, they promise to outdo the current export standards. according to the organisers, showcasing such serious quality control in growing and post-harvest procedures will impress exporters and mango-importing nations, increase the profit share of the farmer by at least 25 per cent and lure private investment in mango processing. farmers, who are now totally dependent on middlemen, will have a streamlined marketing forum. the 450-odd cooperative store chains in the city will also be used as infrastructure for a continuous farmer-to-customer interface. in an uncharacteristic public relations coup, the government plans to invite officials of all the foreign embassies and consulates and corporate heads. â€œmango and cashew have the potential to turn around the economy of the entire konkan region,â€™â€™ says ajit ghorpade, minister of state for irrigation and chairman of the festival steering committee. â€œthe region traditionally never had a strong food cooperative culture like western maharashtra. people were not emotionally involved with farming. but with about five to six lakh people recently losing jobs in the state, and the government taking some initiative, konkanâ€™s youth is increasingly turning to its natural produce. farming is picking up,â€™â€™ says the minister, a grape grower from sangli and the guardian minister for sindhudurg. in this backdrop, the idea to leverage the tremendous popularity of the mango and highlight its still-hidden potential took seed. r.p. gautam, deputy general manager of the agricultural product export development authority (apeda), says the fruitâ€™s export potential can be gauged from the fact that india produces 15 million tonnes of the 18 million tonnes of worldâ€™s mango produce. the alphonso accounts for 35-40 per cent of the rs 75-crore mango export market. the biggest future markets lie in japan, australia, new zealand and the gulf. the state seems finally to be waking up to the big dream. from may 5, it will start airlifting from pune fresh fruits and vegetables to be exported to south-east asia. it will also sign a deal shortly with apeda on mango exports. besides, apmc sindhudurg will establish a cold storage chain next year. one of the worldâ€™s top five management consultant groups is also likely to a study on the pattern of the mango crop and make recommendations. the mango festival 2002 will itself showcase 65 varieties of mangoes grown in the region and involve more than 500 farmers. it will also exhibit mango products like jams, medicines and the local hot-bread â€˜amba poliâ€™, some of these made under governmental schemes by villagers living under the poverty line. the festival is being organised by the tourism cooperative, the sindhudurg krishi pratisthan and the sindhudurg apmc. it is being promoted by the sindhudurg district administration, the local drda, the horticultural and agriculture departments of maharashtra, the maharashtra state marketing board and the konkan agricultural university. mangoes will be sold in 50 stalls, while there two exhibition areas and stages for cultural function ranging from folk music to rap.the mangoes will come in corrugated boxes of one, two and four dozens each, with code numbers so that complaints could be tracked to the tehsil and the centre. under the guidance of the krishi vigyan kendra and the konkan agro varsity at dapoli, five processing centres have been set up in sindhudurg and two in ratnagiri. committe for quality control and pricing have been set up. â€œhere is a chance for good quality growers to make their mark,â€™â€™ says sudhir sawant,mlc and convener of the festival steering committee. he points to problems like low productivity, poor pest management, thoughtless use of nutrients and fertilisers, poor plantation, primitive harvesting methods like hand-picking, careless packaging and a market hijacked by middlemen. the new processes to be introduced at the festival should change most of that, he says. efforts are also on to market the mango produced under the new process as a brand. somebody proposed â€˜sindhuratnaâ€™ as a brand name. they are reviewing it, lest the guy in toulouse or addis ababa gets bitterly late recalling the name of â€˜that sweet fruit from indiaâ€™.

11,State counsel justifies President’s rule,"lucknow: special counsel for the state sc mishra, while rebutting the contentions raised in a public interest litigation (pil) petition challenging the validity of the presidentâ€™s rule in uttar pradesh, has said that it is wholly incorrect to say that the governorâ€™s report to the president was based on extraneous considerations. the aforesaid argument was made before the division bench of the high court comprising justice jagdish bhalla and justice kamal kishore on the pil filed by hs jain, a local lawyer. mishra submitted that the governor had met leaders of various political parties and looked into the possibility of formation of government and, when he found that no party was in a position to form the government, he had recommended imposition of the presidentâ€™s rule. mishra further submitted that the governorâ€™s report was in accordance with the law laid down by the supreme court in bommaiâ€™s case and if the governor felt that no political party was in a position to form the government and. if any political party was invited to form the government then horse-trading might take place, then he could recommend imposition of the presidentâ€™s rule. mishra further contended that if one part of the governorâ€™s report was bad, the entire report could not be vitiated and, if the president was satisfied that no party was in a position to form the government then the presidentâ€™s rule could be imposed. he further contended that the results showed that no party had got clear majority in the assembly elections and no party or independent mla had come forward before the governor to show his/her willingness to support any other party. under these circumstances the formation of a popular government in up did not seem possible, he added.

12,Oppn gets short shrift from govt,"gandhinagar: the entire opposition was suspended from the state assembly on the last day of the session on wednesday after an uproar in the house for nearly three hours over the demand from congress benches that chief minister narendra modi make a statement on the continuing riots. complete bedlam prevailed in the house and the mlas shouted slogans, calling the modi dispensation a ""government of murderers"", even as state congress chief amarsinh choudhary termed the chief minister a ''killer''. modi''s steadfast refusal after three adjournments prompted nearly 40 mlas to rush to the well of the house, shouting slogans, tearing government papers and throwing them at speaker dhirubhai shah. this prompted parliamentary affairs minister suresh mehta to move a resolution to suspend the entire opposition from the house. without any opposition member present, the house finally ended proceedings of the budget session three days ahead of schedule, quickly passing a sales tax amendment bill, a gujarat secondary education amendment bill, and a bill amending an earlier law to regularise unauthorised constructions. after the house met at noon on wednesday, the opposition began its protest against the alleged refusal of the ruling bjp to begin a discussion on the continuing riots. congress mla udesinh baria had sent a notice asking the speaker to tell the cm to make a statement and discuss the riots that had spread to several new areas. when the request was turned down, the opposition began raising anti-modi slogans. with tempers running high, as many as six congress mlas were suspended at regular intervals even as they rushed to the well one after another, in an attempt to snatch official papers from ministers and tear them, and for raising anti-modi slogans. one of them, shailesh parmar, actually succeeded in snatching papers from urban development minister ik jadeja, who was reading out the bill on regularising unauthorised constructions. those suspended included parmar, raghavji patel, khumansinh chauhan, punjabhai vansh, bharat makwana and paresh vasava. amid the din which continued for three straight hours, marked by as many adjournments, bills were passed, though nothing was audible. making a short statement, the cm told the house after the opposition was ousted that he was willing to have a discussion on the prevailing situation in the state and even the speaker had responded positively. however, ""the opposition had lost the opportunity"". the opposition members had not been present during the business advisory committee meeting, where the matter should have been brought up. by absenting themselves, they had shown a negative attitude and missed an opportunity of discussing the prevailing situation, he said. contradicting this, leader of the opposition naresh raval told newspersons later that though he had made the request for a discussion under the rules laid down for emergency discussion, yet the speaker had refused to concede. calling the refusal to discuss such an important issue in the assembly a ""murder of democracy"", raval demanded that the centre take over the task of controlling the law and order situation in the state and dismiss the narendra modi government. ""we will make the demand to prime minister vajpayee on thursday,"" raval said, adding, ""it is unfortunate that despite the continuance of the riots, the gujarat governor has not sent his report.""

14,"Experts, farmers demand withdrawal of permission for Bt Cotton","new delhi: accusing the government of allowing commercial use of bt cotton under pressure from multinationals, farmer leaders and experts on thursday demanded the immediate withdrawal of the permission, saying the actual yield as also the effect of the genetically modified crop on environment and health are yet to be verified. terming the permission as a move to ""dislodge"" small farmers and benefit mncs and corporate sector, they said that the genetic engineering approval committee (geac) has ignored its own mandate to ensure bio safety by granting permission for bt cotton''s commercialisation in the absence of effective monitoring. ""the impression given by bt promoters that it would step up yield substantially is wrong. bt cotton has been genetically engineered to produce toxins, and not to increase yield,"" vandana shiva, director of research foundation of science, technology and ecology, said. trials have shown that other varieties like lhh can have higher output than bt cotton, she said. seeking immediate capacity building at local, regional and national levels for monitoring bio-safety, she said the geac should ensure labelling of seeds for bio-safety and environmental safety. echoing similar views, n k shukla of all india kisan sabha, debabrata biswas of all india agragami kisan sabha and hannan mollah of all india agriculture workers union said bt cotton may destroy indian agriculture, farmers and ecology, and lead to corporatisation of farming.
