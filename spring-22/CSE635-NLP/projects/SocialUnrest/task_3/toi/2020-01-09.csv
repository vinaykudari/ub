0,Police closing files on Ahmedabad riots,"AHMEDABAD: The police in Ahmedabad are busy closing files of investigations into the riots that followed the Godhra carnage last year.

Thanks to directives by the police top brass to fold up the year-long investigations, a large number of those accused of the bloodbath will walk free soon.

Barring a handful of arrests, a large section of the murderous mobs has remained faceless till date.

Names of Bharatiya Janata Party and the Vishwa Hindu Parishad leaders had figured in complaints filed after the Naroda-Patia carnage in which 92 persons were killed on February 28. However, police officers say they have no proof against the big names.

Most of the witnesses, who named political leaders as instigators, have changed their statements.

Assistant commissioner of police M T Rana said: â€˜â€˜There is no evidence against many of those who were accused by local residents. Those named and found guilty have been arrested and chargesheeted.â€™â€™

But there have very few arrests. Shops and restaurants on C G road and other parts of Navrangpura had been allegedly looted by people hailing from the upper strata of the society on February 28. A year later, no arrests have been made in this case.

Of the 46 persons accused of the Naroda-Patia massacre, 38 have been arrested; in the Gulbarg Society case, 41 of the 53 accused have been arrested.

ACP incharge of crime branch H P Agrawath, who is investigating both cases, said: â€˜â€˜We have filed chargesheets against those found guilty and subsequently arrested them. Our focus is now to arrest the handful of people who are absconding.â€™â€™

On March 1, last year, a Tata Sumo was set ablaze and nine persons burnt alive by a 2000-strong mob. Only four of them have been arrested so far. As far as the police are concerned, this case has been â€˜â€˜thoroughly investigatedâ€™â€™.

In Gomtipur, a former municipal corporator Jitendra Vaghela was arrested for rioting and murder at Gomtipur. He spent a few days behind bars and was then released on bail. Vaghela has now been elected as the BJP MLA from Sherkotda. His constituency includes the Gomtipur police station area where the case against him had been filed.

1,All-party meet to seek PM’s help on SYL issue,"CHANDIGARH: The all-party meeting held here, on Wednesday, decided to urge Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee to immediately intervene to help resolve the Satluj Yamuna Link (SYL) canal issue.

It was also resolved that the Punjab government should approach the Supreme Court without delay for absolving it of apex courtâ€™s order to make SYL functional by January 15.

The meeting, convened by chief minister Amarinder Singh, was attended by many political parties and farmersâ€™ organisations but the main opposition party, the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and its ally, the BJP, preferred to boycott it, arguing that it was a futile exercise in the wake of the fastapproaching deadline of completing the canal.

Amarinder Singh has already written a letter to the prime minister, seeking his intervention and urging him to convene a meeting of chief ministers of the states concerned to discuss the matter.

Vajpayee has not responded to his request so far.

The meeting also decided to get the decisions it took ratified by the state assembly by convening its special session.

Though no date has been fixed, Amarinder Singh hinted that it could be towards the end of the month.

Ironically, only three parties, including the ruling Congress, constitute the Vidhan Sabha and two of these, SAD and BJP, stayed away. Independents, however, participated.

Though different political parties and farmersâ€™ organisations were critical of the government over indordinate delay in approaching the apex court and garnering public support on the SYL issue, they extended full support to the government on the matter of protecting the interests of the state in Ravi-Beas waters and authorised it to take all necessary steps.

Though SAD had abstained, it found mention in the speeches of all leaders . While all of them felt that SAD should have participated, some criticised it for â€˜â€˜deliberately abstainingâ€™â€™ from it.

The CM said the government had set up a panel of legal luminaries headed by Fali Nariman and left the timings of approaching the SC to its discretion.

The left parties, the CPI and the CPM, and the latterâ€™s breakaway faction of Mangal Ram Pasla said that, first, the Congress and BJP and its allies like the SAD in Punjab and the INLD in Haryana should reach a common stand on issues such as SYL.

2,New machine boosts farm output: Experts,"MUZAFFARPUR: Sowing with zero tillage machine has increased the production of crops by 25 per cent in 10 districts of Bihar, according to a farm scientist of Rajendra Agriculture University, Pusa, Mrityunjaya Kumar.

The system has not only saved the cost of ploughing and weed removal at the rate of Rs 2,000 per hectare, it has also led to intensive inter-cropping as never before, Kumar told newsmen here on Monday.

As a result, farmers adopting this method have taken paddy, potato, wheat and summer moong in the same field within a year. Under the resource conserving scheme of ADB project of Rajendra Agriculture University, Pusa, wheat has been sown on about 5,000 acres under zero tillage in 10 north Bihar districts. Potato was sown with potato planter on 100 acres, maize on 15 acres, peas, masur and coriander on 257 acres in diara and tal belt.

Sushil Kumar Singh of Nawada village under Mushahari block of this district who was the lone farmer to receive the coveted Krishi Visharad Samman in Delhi on December 23 last has got a distinction in adopting zero tillage. By using RAUâ€™s Saroj and Prabhat varieties he harvested 70 kg of paddy from each katha of land besides his savings on ploughing and weedicides. He used only one seedling in each pit and every seedling developed 30 to 35 plants of paddy, he told visiting newsmen on Monday.

Ramashish Sahni of Chakedhar village under Kalyanpur block of Samastipur district has grown Shaktiman variety of maize by adopting zero tillage and agriculture scientists informed that the noted maize scientist of Mexico, Dro Borlog would visit north Bihar a gain in March next when he would also see this maize laden field.

The main problem with Bihar is that zero tillage machine is too costly for the poor farmers of the state and the state government is not yet ready to give any subsidy on its purchase as in Haryana. One tillage machine costs Rs 17,500 and if it is fitted with multi-seeder, its price goes to about Rs 30,000.

Presently, it is manufactured only in Ludhiana, Punjab where the manufacturing cost comes to hardly Rs 8,000 each. So far no attempt has been made to make it in Bihar. The machine is being sold only at Muzaffarpur and Begusarai in whole of Bihar at present, it may be noted.

A team of eight agriculture scientists from Rajendra Agriculture University, Pusa also visited the fields of Mushahari farmer on Monday to motivate him further for adopting zero tillage system. They included rice expert Ramagya thakur, Mrityunjaya Kumar, R C Rai, Rajendra Prasad, N K Singh, Ramashankar Singh, Subhas Chandra and Niraj Kumar Chaudhary.

3,PMRY beneficiaries threaten suicide,"MUNGER: â€œWe will commit suicide if we do not get loans from banks. We have crossed the criteria for getting loans due to governmentâ€™s apathy and are left with no options,â€� say some youths on condition of anonymity. These youths were selected as genuine candidates for central schemes by a task force committee set up by the district administration. The Centreâ€™s ambitious self-employment scheme, Prime Ministerâ€™s Rojgar Yojana, received a severe jolt in the district in the financial year 2002-2003.

Till the end of 2002, only 29 unemployed youths, out of 300, were granted loans from nationalised banks in instalments. Five nationalised banks like Bank of India, Indian Overseas Bank, Allahabad Bank and State Bank of India have come forward to finance unemployed youths. Though the percentage of their financing is very poor and discouraging, there is only 10 per cent achievement in the PMRY scheme in the district.

Ironically, Punjab National Bank, United Bank, Syndicate Bank, Union Bank of India, Canara Bank and Central Bank of India have not taken any interest in the scheme. They did not finance even one of the selected beneficiaries in the last financial year. In fact, they arbitrarily ignored the directives of the Munger district administration on the plea that the district administration does not take interest in loan recovery.

Munger DM Gautam Goswami said on Tuesday that the Munger administration has helped banks recover around Rs 80 lakh from defaulter loanees since he joined as collector at Munger. Besides, the district officials have accelerated the process of serving warrants and initiating other legal measures, he added.

â€œAs the procedure of loan financing by banks takes time, the achievement in the PMRY scheme is not encouraging for the administration. I have asked the managers of nationalised banks to expedite the disbursement of loans among the beneficiaries with a view to achieve the target by the end of the financial year 2002-2003. The administration hopes that the bank managers will do their best in the coming months,â€� Goswami said.

Abinash Yadav, general manager, Munger Kshetriya Gramin Bank, has asked the Munger administration to give thrust on loan recovery process.

C S Sahay, senior manager, Bank of India, has opined that the district administrative officials should evolve a system that will ensure maintenance of cash cycles in the nationalised banks. â€œThe administration must extend full help in the recovery of bank loans and if it is practical no bank manager will hesitate in financing,â€� Sahay added.

The branch manager of SBI, Safiabad branch, opined that there should also be targets for achievement of loan recovery.

Meanwhile, Samata MP Brahmanand Mandal has asked Goswami to prepare a list of those bankers who do not take interest in the PMRY scheme. He also urged him to send the list to the Centre for action against the guilty bankers.

At a joint meeting of district officials and bankers recently, Mandal said that bankers in Bihar have totally lost their interest in the economic development of the state.

Under the PMRY scheme, 300 beneficiaries were supposed to be disbursed a sum of Rs 3 crore. However, only 29 youths got Rs 25.67 lakh as loans so far.

6,CITU rallies workers against UDF govt's policies,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: CITU on Thursday said about four lakh people - workers and their family members - would picket the Secretariate here and the collectorates in the districts on January 28 to protest against UDF government''s economic policies.

CITU state secretary P K Gurudasan told reporters here that 85 lakh workers in Kerala were in deep crisis due to government ""neglect"" of traditional and agricultural sectors.

He said government''s labour policy would take away the rights and benefits of the workers.

The state government has been ""surrendering to imperialist interests"" and Asian Development Bank conditions, he said, adding the forthcoming Global Investors'' Meet would be used to lure investors by promising them changes in labour laws to suit their requirements.

While CITU was not against private investments from foreign and domestic investors, it was only against ""pledging the interest of the state and workers before the investors"", he said.

The move of the government to privatise public undertakings like KSRTC, KSEB and state Water Authority would have a deterimental effect on the life of ordinary people, he said.

The 19-month rule of UDF had led to crisis in all sectors leading to suicides and starvation deaths of workers, he alleged.
