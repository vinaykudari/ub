1,85 pc farmers clear power bills in Doaba,"JALANDHAR: The administration in all the four districts of Doaba has made alternative arrangements for putting up Akali workers in case they have to be arrested. But the positive attitude of farmers regarding payment of their electricity bills - above 85 per cent have already cleared their bills with two more days to go - appears to have knocked off an important item on the agenda of the Shiromani Akali Dal (Badal) â€œjail bharoâ€� agitation on Wednesday.

â€œWe had estimated a revenue of Rs 4.40 crore from electricity bills. So far the response has been very good. Almost 85 per cent have paid up. This money, had it been flowing in earlier, would be going into various developmental activities and ultimately the farmers would benefit. Development activities had been suspended ever since 1997.

There is need for improvement of lines,work on grid substations and other activities. The delay in the issuance of tubewell connections is also likely to be removed once the board has enough revenue in hand,â€� said HM Jain, engineer-in-chief, North Zone.

Meanwhile, as jails are already overcrowded, the administration has made alternative arrangements for Akali workers in case they have to be arrested in all the four districts of Doaba. Extra caution is being taken by the government in the post-SGPC election scenario. This attitude was visible all over Doaba.

A few nakas have come up outside the main cities of Doaba which include Jalandhar, Nawanshahr, Kapurthala and Hoshiarpur. â€œThe ESI Hospital has been identified in case the Akali workers have to be arrested,â€� said K Siva Prasad, deputy commissioner, Jalandhar.

SSP Rajinder Dhoke, said, â€œthe in-service PAP training centre at Kanjli has been identified for putting up Akali workers of Kapurthala district.â€� Nawanshahr deputy commissioner Ashok Gupta has also ensured that buildings had been identified in the absence of space in jails.

2,Bamial farmers yet to get relief,"PATHANKOT: Farmers had been jubilant over the news that work of removing land-mines from their fields had begun in right earnest. However, farmers of the Bamial sector have yet to get compensation for their paddy crop.

Sources in the district administration said that the delay was on account of the difference in the survey conducted by the Army and the revenue department. Due to the â€˜â€˜stand-off â€™â€™ between the Army and the revenue officials, farmers of Bamial whose land falls under Northern Command of Army, have yet to get compensation for the paddy crop of 2001. For them sowing the wheat crop is but a distant dream since it will take another four months for the Army to complete the de-mining operation.

These farmers, who had earlier fled their homes in wake of the heightened tension at the border, have so far got only 25 per cent of the compensation. The remaining amount is said to be buried in Army records.

Farmers have done all they could. Countless memoranda to the district administration and MLA Rumal Chand did not help, despite many central teams having visited the area in the past year.

During his recent visit to Narot Jaimal Singh, chief minister Amarinder Singh had told farmers that he could do little as the money had to be released by the Ministry of Defence (MoD). â€˜â€˜We will give you the money once the centre releases it,â€™â€™ is what Amarinder had told farmers.

Whatever be the reason behind delay, the farmers have had enough. â€˜â€˜Four months have gone by since Amarinder came here and assured us that his government would take up the matter with the centre.Farmers who already lead modest lives have been forced to live like beggars.

People have been unable to marry their children,â€™â€™ Surinder Mahajan, sarpanch of Kathlour village, said. Deputy Commissioner K A P Sinha told TNN, on Monday, that the actual reason behind the delay was that Army officials of the Northern Command were not taking into consideration the revenue record, on basis of which, payments were to made.

â€˜â€˜I am taking up the matter with senior officials of the Northern Command asking for immediate release of compensation. Civil administration has revised projections and claims according the revenue records. We hope that the Army officials concerned, keeping in view the farmerâ€™s plight, revise their projections so that money can be released soon,â€™â€™ added. A central team had also visited Kathlour and Simbal Skole and Paharipur areas on Saturday to assessment the crop losses suffered farmers.

3,Cong corporator attempts suicide,"AHMEDABAD: Shocked by the Congress leadershipâ€™s volte-face over her ticket, Nazneen Bastawala, a municipal corporator from Dariapur, attempted suicide on Tuesday.

At around 11 am, Bastawala consumed 10 â€˜Trikaâ€™ anti-anxiety pills to protest against the partyâ€™s decision to withdraw the ticket given to her for the Kalupur seat. The ticket was given to outgoing MLA Faroukh Shaikh.

Bastawalaâ€™s son, Abdul Rehman, a school student, said, â€œI had just come back from school when I saw my mother trying to swallow a lot of pills. I tried to stop her but she fell unconscious after managing to gulp down some tablets.â€�

Family members blamed the Congress central leadership for the extreme step she took. On November 22, Bastawala had been declared the Congress candidate from Kalupur. On hearing this, Shaikhâ€™s supporters went on the rampage at the GPCC office the same evening. Not stopping at that, Shaikhâ€™s supporters attacked the office of Tyrewala Travels, owned by Azmat Tyrewala, a Congress leader. Shaikh has a case of rioting and vandalism filed against him with the Kalupur police.

â€œAfter putting in years of dedicated and selfless service in the Congress, I am a disillusioned person. Some leaders of the party have played a very cruel joke on us,â€� said Safibhai Bastawala, the Dariapur corporatorâ€™s husband.

â€œThey have chosen a perpetrator of violence over her. Not only is she better qualified, she has proven that she is into politics to serve the masses, not for money-making,â€� he added.

Says Sahib Shaikh, brother-in-law of the corporator, â€œNot only was she shocked at the Congressâ€™s volte-face, she was traumatised by the constant threatening calls. Slanderous wall paintings and phone calls were being made by her opponents. She was under tremendous pressure for many days now.â€�

Defending his candidature, Faroukh Shaikh says, â€œI do admit that my supporters and local residents may have gone out of control, but I had no role in it. In fact, people were pressuring me to fight the polls as an Independent candidate, but I chose to remain within the bounds of the Congress.â€�

Shaikh added: â€œThis is just the first term as a municipal corporator for Bastawala and I wish her all the best for a long political innings. What she should understand by now is that this is politics and one should not be so sensitive. Along with peopleâ€™s problems one should be able to handle personal difficulties too. I will pray for her to get well soon.â€�

4,Shun politics: Saints to VHP,"AYODHYA: Bharat Sadhu Samaj (BSS) national general secretary Swami Harinarayanand on Tuesday asked the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) to stay away from any political activity during the coming Assembly elections in Gujarat, saying any such act would ""vitiate the social atmosphere and cause rift in the society.""

""Religious and social organisations like the VHP should keep away from political activities and concentrate on their declared aims and objectives to serve the society,"" he told reporters here. VHP leaders should neither participate in any sort of political activity during the Gujarat Assembly polls nor promote the cause of any political party as it would vitiate the social atmosphere and cause rift in society, Harinarayanand said.

The BSS which had worked with the VHP earlier for the unity of Hindu community parted ways with it because of its ""ambitious programmes aimed at promoting the cause of a particular political party"", Harinarayanand said. He accused political parties of ""trying to capture power by dividing the Hindu community in the name of places of worship and narrow caste-based politics that has threatened unity of the country"" and urged political parties to refrain from appeasement of minorities. Asserting that the Ram temple should be built in Ayodhya, he said land should be given to the Hindu community for the purpose. ""I hope political parties and the Muslim community will realise the sentiments of the Hindu society in this regard,"" he added.

Earlier, the BSS urged the Union government to step up security around the places of religious importance in view of the terrorist attack on the Raghunath Temple in Jammu on Sunday. Expressing concern over recurring incidents of attack on temples in the country, a resolution requesting the Union government to step up security at the temples was passed at the regional conference of BSS here. The resolution also called upon people to join hands to defeat extremists forces and wondered why the united nations has remained a mute spectator despite continued terrorist strikes in the country.

5,Extremist rehab policy under review,"RANCHI: The growing incidence of extremist-related activities in Jharkhand despite the governmentâ€™s extremist rehabilitation policy announced last year is now proving to be a big financial burden on the state coffers.

Among the 270 people killed in extremist attacks in the last two years, 121 were policemen. With the compensation for the slain police personnel working out at Rs 60.5 crore, including cash and jobs, the state government is now seriously reviewing its policy, in a way conceding its failure in luring extremists back to the social mainstream notwithstanding the recent surrender by them in Giridih district.

Taking a leaf out of the policy of the Andhra government, the Jharkhand government would now be hiring private vehicles for patrolling in the Naxalite-affected areas. Police vehicles are too easily identifiable, said IG (operations) R C Kaithal.

The police have also woken up to the need for taking even the lowest-ranking personnel in the hierarchy into confidence following a series of landmine blasts, and the SPs have been asked to inspect â€œchowkidari paradesâ€� too.

Though chief minister Babulal Marandi claims to have constructed several hundred kilometres of roads in the state, his priorities nevertheless appear to be confused. While the stateâ€™s MLAs and MPs, including the chief minister himself, have managed to get priority accorded to their own areas, connectivity in the rural Naxalite-affected areas still remains abysmally low. The government, after trumpeting its achievements during the last two years, has only now decided to take up these roads on a priority basis.

Significantly, the government is also contemplating to add two more districts â€” East and West Singbhum â€” to the list of Naxalite-affected districts. According to the police, extremist-related incidents are on the rise in the bordering areas of Orissa, specially in the Ghatshila region of West Singbhum.

6,Delhi HC nod to govt on FCI closure,"DHANBAD: In a significant development, the Delhi High Court vacated the stay over closure of the Fertiliser Corporation of India Ltd (FCI) on Tuesday and allowed the government to go ahead with its closure decision.The high court decision has come as a shock to the employees of the premier Sindri unit of the FCI who, hoping against hope, had pinned hope over the high court judgment. We hoped the HC judgment will come to our rescue, but now we have lost all hopes, an FCI worker said.The high court verdict may also prove to be the last nail in the coffin of this first public sector fertiliser plant of the country.It can be mentioned here that after the AAIFR approved the decision of the BIFR to close down the FCI Company as a whole as the government failed to submit a revival package within the stipulated time, recognised trade unions of all the four units of the FCI had approached the Delhi High court for relief on the basis that the revival proposal of the company was still under active consideration of the Group of Ministers (GoM).The court then stayed the implementation of the AAIFR order for closure of the company till final decision in this regard by the Group of Ministers. The court had fixed November 26 as next date of hearing.In the meantime, the GoM recommended for closure of the FCI Company as a whole except the Jodhpur mine unit to be hived off from FCI for running as a separate company on August 27. The Gom recommendation was approved by the Union Cabinet on September 5.According to reports reaching here, the issue was brought before the court again on Tuesday and the learned judge, on the basis of the cabinet approval, vacated the stay and allowed the government to go ahead with its plan of closure of the company.

7,Auto union protests meter recalibration,"HYDERABAD: The Auto Driver Brothers Union has alleged that the weights and measures department succumbed to pressure from meter repairers on the issue of continuing meter recalibration at the rate of 20 paise instead of 40 paise.

By doing so the department has violated the governmentâ€™s order to fix meters at the rate of 40 paise for every 1/10th km, union convenor Mohd Amanullah Khan stated in a press release issued on Tuesday said.

Khan said that the fixing of meter to move at a rate of 20 paise would result in the meters developing defects, which was aimed at helping the meter repairers.

The manner in which the meters have been recalibrated would also affect the life expectancy of meters due to double revolving frequency involved in adjusting the meters to run at the rate of 20 paise for every 1/20th km instead of 40 paise for every 1/10 km, he said.

The increase in the revolving rate was meant to reduce the revolving frequency of the meter and to protect the meters from going out of order frequently, the release stated. Khan alleged that auto drivers were being subjected to harassment by traffic policemen on various counts.

Increasing petrol and diesel prices were also having an impact on the earnings of automen, he added. The auto union leader said that auto drivers would never charge more than the amounts prescribed by the government.

9,ONGC to get $1.25 bn revenue from overseas investment,"NEW DELHI: State-run Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) is likely to net about $1250 million in revenue from its investment in overseas operations during the 10th Five Year Plan Period (2002-07).

ONGC would start getting revenue from its investment in Vietnam gas project from the current fiscal itself, with an expected $6 million flowing from sale of gas to the downstream industries in Vietnam, company sources said.

The revenue projections do not include the recent $720 million deal for taking 40 per cent stake in Greater Nile oil project of Sudan from where the Corporation would get three million tonnes of crude oil annually.

The Vietnam project, where ONGC has 45 per cent stake, would give around $60 million annually from 2005-06 when the project starts capacity production.

Its $1.7 billion investment in Sakhalin oil and gas field in Russia for a 20 per cent interest is likely to yield $135 million in revenue from 2005-06 when the project start producing oil.

Sources said the Corporation was likely to get $557 million in revenue from its share of oil in 2006-07.

ONGC is expecting around $75 million from the Tuba oil field in Iraq in 2005-06 which would increase to over $100 million by 2006-07, sources said adding revenue stream from the Algerian oil field is likely to be around $40 million from 2005.

The Venezuela investment was likely to give ONGC $50 million from 2005, they said.

10,"George only a political colleague, says Jaya Jaitly","NEW DELHI: Samata Party leader Jaya Jaitly has defended her relationship with Defence Minister and NDA Convener George Fernandes saying they were just ""political colleagues.""

""I am a political colleague. Just like every other man and every other woman. People get nervous about women, who are educated, successful in politics, who are not afraid of saying and doing things, ready to fight for a cause and come out on the streets. They try to throw mud on the image of such people,"" Jaitly said in an interview to be telecast on SAB TV.

She said the question of her relationship with Fernandes never came up among the thousands of party workers and trade union activists they have worked with all along.

""This issue was raked up to rattle the government when this government became strong as Fernandes was its Convener. In villages, we see that if someone from upper caste wants to snatch the land of a person from a lower caste, the former commits rape and burns the house of the latter. You can apply the analogy to me,"" Jaitly said.

Asserting her ties with Fernandes had nothing to do with her separation from her husband, Jaitly said, ""I am still very close to everybody in my family. People separate for different kind of reasons but whether it is my in-laws or children, we are very close. Such things happen in life.""

14,Cong will start students’ union polls: Mohan,"KURUKSHETRA:Congress leader and Kalka MLA Chander Mohan on Wednesday criticised the Haryana government for not holding studentsâ€™ union elections in colleges and universities and said that if voted to power Congress government would start these polls.

Talking to media persons after presiding over a state level conference of National Students Union of India here, Mohan said that O P Chautala and his sons had failed to deliver their promise of holding these elections, adding that in democracy such elections were a must. He said that other genuine demands of the students would also be fulfilled by Congress.

Pointing at the steep rise in tuition fee he said that it would be impossible for the poor students to opt for higher studies. Criticising the prevailing law and order situation, he demanded that government should publish a white-paper regarding the crime rate in the state as compared to the previous regimes.

He described CMâ€™s foreign trip as a failure since no note worthy industrialist had shown interest in Haryana. The decision to set up casinos was an attempt to mislead the youth, he said.
