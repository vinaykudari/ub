0,Maneka asks govt to take back land for cow shelter,"NEW DELHI: Maneka Gandhi, the pioneer of animal rights movement in India, has expressed inability to run a gosadan (cow shelter) in Bawana and has asked Delhi government to take back land allotted to her NGO. Apparently, Gandhi is peeved at what she calls ""politicisation of cow shelter issue.""

Gandhi met CM Sheila Dikshit on Tuesday to discuss PFA Goshalla, run by her NGO Ruth Cowell Foundation. Gandhi has asked the government to either change its policy regarding the number of cows that can be housed in a gosadan or take back land allotted to her NGO.

Delhi development minister Raj Kumar Chauhan said: ""We have no problems in this. If she wants to hand over the land, we are ready to take care of the animals ourselves.""

The NGO was allotted 63 acres of land at Bawana. The cow shelter was supposed to develop a capacity of 2,800. On January 5, an inspection was conducted and it was found that the shelter had only 1,067 cows. Of the 63 acres allotted to the NGO, 28 acres had been acquired by the DDA and another 20 acres have been notified for acquisition. In all 15 acres of land is still with the NGO.

The government is cracking down on cow shelters for not utilising the land allotted to them properly. Gandhi, however, said: ""The terms of the government are untenable. They expect us to keep 200 cows in one acre. It is not a poultry. Keeping 200 cows in one acre would mean making cows stand next to each other.""
