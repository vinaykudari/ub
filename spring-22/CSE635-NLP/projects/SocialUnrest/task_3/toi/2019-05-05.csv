0,Speaker's post should come to ruling party: BJP,"NEW DELHI: With key ally TDP rejecting the offer of Lok Sabha speakership, BJP on Saturday night said the post should now come to the ruling party.

""The post of the Speaker should be with the ruling party as per the convention since the Deputy Speaker''s post is with the main Opposition party (Congress),"" BJP Spokesman V K Malhotra said here on Saturday night.

He said Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee has already indicated that he would discuss the issue with the allies.

The election of the Speaker is slated for May 10.

The executive committee meeting was presided over by the state party president and MP, Manmohan Samal, which was also attended by the party''s national secretary, Sanjay Paswan, who took charge of Orissa recently.

Das said the meeting discussed the results of the last panchayat elections and the party felt there was reason to feel satisfied with the outcome.

The BJP candidates won 180 out of 854 posts of Zilla Parishad members behind the BJD and Congress, he said.

""But we feel that the Congress would have got routed if both BJD and BJP had not failed to reach an electoral adjustment,"" he said, adding, ""We are of the opinion that the two parties should fight the civic polls together to be held sometime in November next.""

Admitting that not fighting the panchayat polls together was a mistake, Das said that BJP''s efforts to have a tie-up with BJD before the elections did not succeed.

The matter was left at the discretion of the party leadership at the district level which did not work. We could reach adjustment in only three of the 30 districts, he said.

In the political resolution, Das said, the focus would be laid on the precarious financial situation in the state.

""We will come forward with our advice to the government as we feel developmental programmes should not suffer in the name of fiscal crisis.""

Replying to a question, he said the expulsion of four party MLAs from the party and disassociation of two associate members (for having signed the nomination papers of rebel BJD candidate Dilip Ray in the Rajya Sabha elections) did not figure at the meeting on Saturday.

The party president referred to the matter in his opening remarks saying what the legislators did amounted to gross indiscipline. The matter was also seriously viewed by the party''s central leadership, he said.

1,Missing boy turns into political football,"BATHINDA:The alleged arrest of a youth by Dayalpura police after an innocuous complaint has put the Bathinda police in an embarrassing situation as the youth has disappeared under mysterious circumstances and political leaders of the area are trying to get mileage out of the issue.

In a complaint to senior district officials and the Punjab Human Rights Commission, Bhajan Kaur, a resident of Dayalpura village, alleged that her handicapped son Teja Singh (25) was arrested by the police on April 25 at the instance of Rampura Phool MLA Gurpreet Singh Kangar.The police tortured the boy to death and disposed of his dead body, she alleged. Supporting the woman is former power minister Sikander Singh Malooka, who is a bete noire of Kangar and lost Rampura Phool seat to the latter in the assembly elections held in February.

Kangar declined he has anything to do with Teja Singh. But the district police claimed that Teja Singh was called at the police post at Dayalpura after one Swaran Singh in the village made a complaint against him for using foul language. But after just a reprimand, Teja Singh was allowed to go home. â€˜â€˜But when the political leaders here are out to extract political mileage out of a petty issue, mountain is being made out of a molehill,â€™â€™ said a police officer.

Refuting the allegations of Bhajan Kaur that the boy was missing and killed in police custody on April 25,Rampura Phool DSP Balbir Singh Khehra said that the boy, after leaving the police post on April 25 with his brother Jaggi, had stayed with his aunt (mausi) at Gaziana in Moga district on April 26-27 and left for another relative on April 28. â€˜â€˜As the family of the boy is under influence of some political persons who have sensed a potential opportunity for creating embarrassment for the police, the boy went in seclusion to mislead the police,â€™â€™ said Janak Singh, the SHO of Dayalpura police post.

After the former power minister accompanied Bhajan Kaur to deputy commissioner and district police chief, the police deputed DSP Balbir Singh Khehra to inquire into the matter. A parallel magisterial inquiry has been started by the Rampura Phool sub divisional magistrate.

The DSP said that the mother and other family members of the boy were not coming forward to record their statements with him inspite of the fact that he had visited their house three times. But Mukhtiar Kaur, the aunt of the boy at Gaziana, has submitted to the inquiry officer that the boy stayed at her house on April 26-27.

Farmers in the state are being motivated to diversify crop cultivation and reduce the area under paddy as it was straining natural resources like soil and water, besides it would help in overcoming the problem of surplus production of cereals, director, agriculture, Rajeev Arora said here on Saturday. He said groundnut would be sown over an area of 5,000 hectares, til on 10,000 hectares, soybean on 1,000 hectares, pulses like urd, moong and moth on 27,000 hectares and an area of 35,000 hectares would be covered under arhar.

Adequate availability of all the agricultural inputs for farmers would be ensured for the forthcoming kharif season. He said 250 demonstration and 500 mini-kits of groundnut, 100 demonstration and 200 mini-kits of til, 100 demonstration and 200 mini-kits of soybean, 450 demonstration and 600 mini-kits of kharif pulses and 500 demonstration and 1,000 mini-kits of arhar crop would be organised on the farmers fields, free of cost. The action plan, Arora said, would also finalise district-wise targets of area coverage.

Farmersâ€™ training camps and group meetings would be organised to encourage the farmers to adopt crop diversification so as to implement this programme successfully. Arora further said that, for this purpose, a two-week district-wise programme had been chalked out under which 186 village or circle, 35 sub-division and 18 district-level training camps would be organised.

Experts of the state agriculture university and officers of the department would impart training to the farmers in these camps. To ensure success of the programme, input supplying agencies have been requested to arrange and stock all agricultural inputs in time and at the doorstep of the farmers.

Emphasis was also being laid on the quality aspect of agricultural inputs.To ensure supply of quality seed for cotton crop, a special quality control campaign was being launched in the cotton growing districts.

4,‘Police joined Gujarat rioters’,"KOLKATA: A large section of communalised police and civil service collaborated with the rioters in Gujarat, reveals the report Communalism Combat.

The magazine, devoted to the cause of communal harmony, has come out with a special issue on Gujarat genocideâ€™.

Yeh andar ki bat hai, police hamare sath hai, yelled frenzied Bajrang Dal activists in Ahmedebad, the magazine reported.

â€œThe preparation for the genocide started much before the Godhra mayhem.The torching of the train compartment, a ghastly crime, provided the excuse.The poisonous pamphleteering by the Sangh Parivar outfits inciting Hindus to boycott Muslims, ruin them economically and kill them had started during Keshubhai Patelâ€™s regime. A virtual ban was imposed on appointment of Muslims in government jobs, particularly in police, and saffornisation the law-enforcers was institutionalised. About 4,000 Sangh were absorbed as police sahayak.â€�

The prevention of inter-community marriage and changes in syllabus eulogising Hitler prepared the mindset for the pogrom. The rapid growth of rabid groups of VHP and Bajrang all over the state, distribution trishuls, swords in public meetings completed the preparation,â€� magazineâ€™s co-editor Teesta Setalvad said during her recent to the city.

The large-scale use of gas cylinders as explosives to blast buildings and mosques, supply of petrol, rifles, trishuls and swords well as use of wireless sets,mobile phones and votersâ€™ list to coordinate attacks and identify the victims smacked of cold-blooded planning,â€� she maintained.

Teesta questioned Narendra Modiâ€™s intentions quoting the National Human Rights Commissionâ€™s report which spoke of â€œserious failures of intelligenceâ€� and lack of action by the state government â€œleading to the Godhra tragedy and the subsequent deaths and destructionâ€�.

â€œDespite reports of tension over the abusive slogans and hooliganism by the Ramsevaks returning from Ayodhya, Modi failed to take make any preventive moves,â€� she pointed out.The NHRC questioned the failure some district authorities to prevent massacres while others withstood the pressures from top.

â€œSuch a development clearly points to local factors and players overwhelming the district officers in certain instances, but not in others. Given the widespread reports and allegations of groups of wellorganised persons, armed with mobile telephones and address, singling out certain homes and properties for death and destruction in certain districtsâ€”sometimes within the view of police stations and personnelâ€”the further question arises as to what factors were and who were players in the situations that went out of control,â€� said the NHRC.

The Combat report said that the saffron supporters went berserk on February 28 and Ahmedabad police killed 40 persons to â€œmaintain law and orderâ€�.

But 36 of them were Muslims who were apparently at the receiving end. While the mass killings were engineered in 30 locations, Ahmedabad police commissioner condoned the inaction by personnel who were â€œequally influenced by the general sentimentâ€�.

5,Century-old laws to change,"KOLKTATA: More than a century after they were first written down in black and white, the Asiatic Society is finally going to change the way it elects its executive council and office bearers â€” aiming to make it more â€˜democratisedâ€™ and modernised.

The amendments to Act 36, Act 37 and Act 50 of the regulations have been approved by the Societyâ€™s outgoing council and now awaits a final nod from the Union ministry of Culture.

Speaking on the eve of the Societyâ€™s annual council elections scheduled on May 6, outgoing president of the Society Biswanath Banerjee said, â€œWe have also sought a change to another rule: that the tenure of each elected council be increased from the present one year to two. It is almost impossible to carry out any sustained good work unless an elected body stays in power for a sufficient period of timeâ€�.

Interestingly, only last week on April 25 a division bench of the Calcutta high court dismissed a petition filed almost a year ago by one Samir Ray Chaudhury, challenging the legality of the 2001 election barely 10 days before its term expired.

Highlighting the achievement of the Society in recent times, senior members like former vice chancellors, professors and several former office bearers of the Society said the 127-year-old institution had come out with a series of publications and held a number of seminars in 2001-02.

â€œMany organisations hold seminars. But no one knows what happens to the papers presented thereafter. We have brought out eight books They include one based on a lecture given here by Nobel laureate Hard Townes.

â€œWe also held 15 seminars, bought new computers for researchers, added more than 400 puthis to our collection, got new digital reprographic machines and four new microfilm reading machines,â€� said general secretary Manabendu Banerjee.

The Society has been under a sustained attack from both the Centre as well as a section of members of late for their failure to improve the library, to preserve ancient and rare manuscripts properly and for failing to submit a proper audit and account report.

Like last time the Society elections this time too â€” scheduled on Monday May 6 â€” will witness a close fight between the official panel and the rival panel.

Both sides have several big names fighting for office bearers and council members posts.

6,1 killed in Devhar rioting,"VADODARA: A person allegedly injured in police firing at Devhat village, under Rangpur police station, on Friday died at the Chhota Udepur Civil Hospital on Saturday.

The village, meanwhile, witnessed more trouble late on Friday night. Police had a tough time in controlling the rioters, most of whom are residents of nearby tribal villages. However, no untoward incident was reported in the village on Saturday.

As reported earlier, trouble broke out after 10 houses were burnt in the village, which is located on the Madhya Pradesh border. The reason was reportedly a feast, attended by members of different communities, wherein a cow was allegedly slaughtered.

Police said that beef was served at the feast and someone informed them about it, which caused a ruckus. ""We believe that the riots broke out because each side thought the other betrayed them by informing the police,"" said a senior police officer.

Meanwhile, the ban on pillion-riding will be lifted from 6 am to 7 pm in Vadodara city on Sunday.

7,RSS to lay down guidelines for Vajpayee govt,"NEW DELHI: For the first time since the BJP-led government assumed power, the RSS will be preparing a report, a sort of guideline, for the government to follow. Prime Minister Vajpayee has agreed to the move.

A week ago, a two-day meeting was held at the Prime Ministerâ€™s residence. On the first day, top RSS leaders K Sudarshan, K V Sheshadri and Madandas Devi met the Prime Minister. On the second day, apart from Vajpayee and home minister L K Advani, Jana Krishnamurthy and Kushabhau Thakre, too, were present. Pramod Mahajan and Venkiah Naidu joined in towards the end of the talks.

Criticising the government, the RSS leadership said in the past two-and-half years, a communication gap has developed between the RSS/Sangh Parivar leaders and the government because the Prime Minister has not been taking the RSS leadership into confidence or holding meetings with them. The leaders pointed out that the RSS ideology forms the basis of the BJP, yet the party has been delinked from it.

Vajpayee and Advani, however, said the RSSâ€™ statements on several occasions had embarrassed the government in public and allowed the Opposition to make it an issue. They said the RSS should not do anything that will bring down the government.

Finally, an understanding was arrived at. The government and the RSS will have frequent meetings now, which will be called by the Prime Minister. The RSS will restrain from making statements that could embarrass the government. The government will follow the RSS ideology. The RSS will prepare a guideline for the government to follow so that it is not embarrassed or destabilised by toeing the RSS line.

The guidelines have evolved in the course of the two-day meeting, which will be formulated in a written report by the RSS.

â€¢ The BJP, while cooperating with its allies, will not follow an appeasement policy though it does not intend to go into a confrontation with them.

â€¢ There will be a cabinet reshuffle and organisational changes in the BJP, after the ongoing budget session of Parliament ends.

â€¢ The RSS wants changes to be brought about to give the government a new image. For one, it wants finance minister Yashwant Sinha out. With Ram Vilas Paswan gone, Sharad Yadav should be prevented from leaving by giving him a better portfolio. He is unhappy about carrying out labour reforms, having been practising socialist politics most of his career.

â€¢ RSS wants the government to go ahead with the Hindutva agenda, but in a new form. Since Ram Mandir, Universal Civil Code and Article 370 are beyond the NDA agenda, the government should take up issues like cultural nationalism, pseudo-secularism â€” Vivekananda brand of Hindutva.

â€¢ The top RSS leadership held a follow-up meeting in Nagpur with their second rung leaders, where they said statements made by Mahanta Abaidyanath and Togadia are not being endorsed by the RSS, since this brand of Hindutva was damaging the cause. And hence, a new brand needed to be followed.

â€¢ On Gujarat: There will be no change in chief ministership. This has been accepted by Vajpayee. Assembly polls will be held after the Presidential Elections on July 30, that is September or October.

â€¢ On Pakistan: There should be no shift from the present line. No dilution of the issue. No dialogue with Musharraf before cross-border terrorism is sorted out.

8,Eviction drive triggers violence in Kolkata,"KOLKATA: A violent resistance and a sit-in by Trinamul Congress leader Mamata Banerjee on Saturday forced the Railways and the police to abandon plans to evict unauthorised squatters on the side of railway tracks in south Kolkata.

The situation tended to get out of control following heavy brick batting and lathi charge by the police till railway officials decided to call off the drive.

Four vehicles were damaged and a number of shanties gutted following the use of crude petrol-bombs. The police claimed that angry squatters had set the shanties on fire to create panic whereas locals said that it was the police who had set the huts ablaze.

Trinamul Congress activists blocked traffic on arterial routes of the city, leading to a virtual collapse of the traffic system. Commuters had a harrowing experience as local train services in the Sealdah-Budge Budge section was disrupted. Protesters also squatted on the tracks in Canning disrupting rail traffic. The party activists also set up road blocks at Moulali, S N Banerjee Road and Shyambazar, disrupting peak hour traffic. Vehicles were stranded for over 45 minutes at Shyambazar and Moulali. At Moulali, the protesters were led by Trinamul Congress MP Sudip Bandopadhyay.

Mamata supervised the resistance and kept calling parliamentary affairs minster Pramod Mahajan and railway minister Nitish Kumar, demanding that a proper rehabilitation scheme be announced first.

10,"No govt role in interest fixation, Sinha","NEW DELHI: Ruling out any government role in interest rate fixation, finance minister Yashwant Sinha on Saturday said the endeavour would be to take the economy towards a softer interest regime.

""Inflation is well within control. Low inflation warrants softer interest rate regime...We want the economy to move in that direction,"" he said at the National Cooperative Union of India here.

The government, he said, has no intention of determining interest rates which would be dependent on market conditions.

""Interest rates have been totally deregulated, though in certain areas we intervene as and when necessary,"" he said.

Stressing the need for competition among banks, Sinha said they have to be competitive in order to meet the challenges thrown by the rapidly changing economic scenario.

He said FIs are also facing problems in raising cheap money as there is a cost involved in attracting deposits from the market.

Describing the multi-layer structure in cooperative banks as a cost escalating mechanism, the FM said the three-tier system at state, district and primary levels is adding to the cost substantially.

15,Marker systems gets government nod,"MUMBAI: In a major blow to the multi-crore fuel adulteration racket, the ministry of petroleum has finally approved the â€˜markerâ€™ system, which detects adulteration easily, for the National Capital Region.

The marker system entails the addition of a small quantity of chemical additive to petrol or diesel at the refining stage.

If the fuel is adultererated subsequently, it can be detected with the help of a portable equipment.

Adulteration causes fuel to burn poorly in the vehicle engine, and is a major cause of the high pollutants being emitted from the tailpipe.

It was thus also recommended by the high court-appointed V.M. Lal committee in 1999 as one of the measures for reducing pollution.

Petrol dealers, who have been pushing for the system for over two years, welcomed the decision. â€œThe system will pin point who is actually doing the adulteration,â€™â€™ says Ravi Shinde of the Petrol Dealers Association.

He recounts how he and Dr Sandeep Rane, who filed the petition against vehicular pollution in the Bombay High Court, personally met petroleum minister Ram Naik to push for the system.

While field tests were being conducted on the system for a long time, there were also reports that members of the oil adulteration mafia were trying to block its introduction.

â€œItâ€™s now only a matter of time before it comes to Maharahstra,â€™â€™ said Mr Shinde. Petrol pump owners had gone on strike in 2000 over the raids carried out at their pumps to check adulteration.

This once-prosperous businessman, dealing in kerosene, and his 11-member family are not the only riot victims to have ""suffered"" due to the ''paltry'' government compensation.

Some have got Rs 500, some have been given Rs 1,000 and still others have not got a paise because physical verification of their damaged and burnt property is pending.

Hamid''s daughter, Amina Bano, laments: ""The shop and our home were in the same premises in the Baba Bar Kulla area of Shahibaug and was looted and set ablaze by a mob. My father expected a compensation of not less than Rs 1.5 lakh. When he was faced with this measly one-time payment he lost heart.""

Near the Dilli Darwaja, a camp which came up after the recent arson in Khanpur also has several Hindus who share the plight of Hamid. Ramesh Datania says: ""We used to live in shanties along the Khanpur main road that is lined by several well-known hotels and lodges. On the fateful day, we were attacked and our houses were destroyed. One doesn''t know if we will even qualify for getting compensation since many of the hutments were illegal.""

Ismailbhai Jamilbhai, a resident of Vasna, believes he has lost his property and goods worth Rs 60,000 when his house in Guptanagar Housing Colony was looted and damaged by rioters. But, reality has shattered his estimates and dreams. He has got just Rs 500 to cover his losses.

Abdul Karim R Shelat, who coordinates relief work in some of the six camps at Juhapura, says ""Only about 40 per cent of the total 6,000 riot affected staying in the camps in Juhapura have been compensated. But, even those compensated have got very little solace. With just Rs 500 or Rs 1000 how does the government expect them to rebuild their lives?""

Jehnatbibi Mohammad Shah from the Musasuhag Kabristan area of Shahibaug has probably got the highest compensation of Rs 12,700 among all her neighbours, she admits it''s negligible. ""My house was looted and then burnt. With no means of livelihood left I''m nothing better than a beggar now. How can I go back to a home, which doesn''t exist and how do I start rebuilding with this paltry sum, she asks. Cases like this are dime a dozen at the relief camp in Aman Chowk of Gomtipur area, too.

Shah-e-Alam Roza camp in-charge Mohsin Kadri told TNN, ""I met Chief Minister Modi on Friday and complained about the miniscule amounts being given to the riot victims. He assured me that he would look into the matter. One can only hope he keeps his promise.""

22,Person hurt in Devhat rioting dies,"VADODARA: A person allegedly injured in police firing at Devhat village, under Rangpur police station, on Friday died at the Chhota Udepur Civil Hospital on Saturday.

The village, meanwhile, witnessed more trouble late on Friday night. Police had a tough time in controlling the rioters, most of whom are residents of nearby tribal villages. However, no untoward incident was reported in the village on Saturday.

As reported earlier, trouble broke out after 10 houses were burnt in the village, which is located on the Madhya Pradesh border. The reason was reportedly a feast, attended by members of different communities, wherein a cow was allegedly slaughtered.

Police said that beef was served at the feast and someone informed them about it, which caused a ruckus. ""We believe that the riots broke out because each side thought the other betrayed them by informing the police,"" said a senior police officer.

Meanwhile, the ban on pillion-riding will be lifted from 6 am to 7 pm in Vadodara city on Sunday.

23,Notice to Guj govt unnecessary: PM,"NEW DELHI: A day ahead of the vote on the Opposition censure motion on Gujarat in the Rajya Sabha, the Prime Minister has said there was no need for a formal notice to the Gujarat government if the state government is working in concert with the Centre''s directions.

Talking to reporters in Gwalior on Saturday night, the Prime Minister said if the state government carries out its activities as per the Centre''s directions without being given a formal notice then there was no need for such a notice.

Besides, he said the current debate in Parliament was in a way a notice to the Gujarat government.

Reacting to the PM''s statement, Congress spokesman S Jaipal Reddy said it was in ""direct conflict"" with the statement made by Leader of the Rajya Sabha Jaswant Singh in course of discussion in the House on the motion on Gujarat.

""In fact, both the BJP and the prime minister are shifting their position too often on Gujarat. This is one more blatant illustration of this process,"" he said, adding there was no such thing as informal operation or activation of Article 355.

Reddy said the government cannot say on one hand that it agreed with the motion in the Rajya Sabha which involves invocation of Article 355 and say in the same breath that there is no need for a formal notice under the article.

He maintained that if the motion is passed unanimously in the Rajya Sabha, then the entire House is of the view that government in Gujarat is not being carried on in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution.

Meanwhile, RJD president Laloo Prasad Yadav said the censure motion would be passed in the Rajya Sabha.

In a related development, the leader of the INLD, an NDA ally, Om Prakash Chautala, said Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi should forsake pride and resign owning moral responsibility for the violence in the state.

Commenting on the incidents in Gujarat, Chautala told reporters in Jabalpur that it would be impossible to create a congenial atmosphere in the Gujarat unless people came forward to restore peace. ""The confrontation between pride and decorum might prove fatal to the progress of the nation, he said.

Referring to the debates in Parliament on Gujarat, he said: ""Good suggestions put forward by the Opposition should be accepted.""

24,Women protest police atrocities in Vadodara,"VADODARA: For four days from Tuesday, 25 men and women courted arrest by flouting curfew norms in the Old City areas of Vadodara alleging police atrocities, especially against women, during recent combing operations. They say that the police has been using excessive force, beating up women, even pregnant women in some cases. Apart from initiating legal action, some of them have begun signature campaigns and are planning satyagrahs and protest marches to drive home their point.

Residents of Kagda chawl have filed complaints in the city court claiming that drunk policemen roughed up 12 women, beating them with lathis and spewing abuses. ""The chief judicial magistrate has ordered an inquiry and I have received a FIR. The inquiry will now be conducted by the detection of crime branch (DCB),"" said joint commissioner of police P C Thakur.

""The aim of courting arrest by flouting curfew norms was to send a message to the police that instead of attacking us at night under the pretext of ''combing operations'', they can do so in broad daylight. The aim was to open their eyes to the injustice they were meting out to the residents, especially women, in the Old City areas,"" said Jagdish Shah, a member of the Sarvodaya Trust, one of the organisations spearheading the movement.

""All residents in the Old City areas are not bomb-throwing miscreants. But, male police officers had no qualms about hitting even pregnant women. They also hurt the children and mouthed gruesome abuses. Legally, no male policeman can attack a woman,"" said Afsana, a resident at Bavamanpura.

Sahiyar, a woman''s organisation, has written to the National Commission for Women and the city police commissioner about the atrocities against women.

Though the police is inquiring into two separate incidents where policemen have spewed abuses at women, threatened them and hit them on the hips, buttocks, arms and legs, no report is forthcoming yet.

Women in Sabina Park Society and Dhanani Park Society at Ajwa Road have complained to the Vadodara police commissioner about the atrocities of the local police sub inspector and have demanded his transfer. Some activists have called for his suspension till the inquiry is completed.

Shiraz Balsara, a woman''s activist working in the tribal areas of Maharashtra and now on a visit to investigate atrocities here, says the victims have complained of verbal abuse and have also sustained minor fractures and bruises due to the physical attacks by policemen.

""I met women who were terrorised at gun point, women who were attacked by lathi-wielding policemen and some were pregnant women. Their children were hit in front of them and they were asked to get the men in the house to come out."" she said.

25,AMC to sign water supply deal with govt,"AHMEDABAD: Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) has decided to ink a deal with the state government to get rid of the erratic water supply from Kadana Dam through Raska weir, to enhance the water supply in the city.

The AMC standing committee on Saturday cleared the proposal for a deal according to which the AMC will pay Rs 5.5 crore per month for 6.5 crore gallons released per day from Kadana dam.

""It was badly needed because in the past few days, the water released in Shedi canal from Kadana dam was constantly going down,"" said Ahmedabad Mayor Himmatsinh Patel.

For the past one week, the city is receiving 4 crore gallons of water per day from Raska weir when it actually needs 6.5 crore gallons per day. ""We cannot take more groundwater because there is a possibility of increase in fluoride content,"" said the AMC standing committee chairman Badruddin Sheikh adding that the groundwater level has already gone down to 600 feet.

Meanwhile, AMC has given priority to water-related projects.

26,Enviro tribunal in limbo as govt can’t afford judge,"NEW DELHI: Whatever happened to the national environment tribunal, which was supposed to deliver speedy justice to those suffering from accidents involving hazardous substances? Legislation on this was passed seven years ago. It has been talked of so often that some environmentalists believe that the tribunal exists. But the fact is that the environment ministry just hasnâ€™t been able to find a â€˜â€˜suitable incumbentâ€™â€™ to head it.

In other words, the National Environment Tribunal Act (Neta) of 1995 has remained inoperational all these years in what can only be described as a gross display of unconcern. Particularly so in a country where, say environmentalists, â€˜â€˜smaller Bhopalsâ€™â€™ occur almost every day â€” they were referring to the 1984 Bhopal gas leak tragedy.

The main hitch, it seems, has been finding someone to head the tribunal at the scales the government wants to pay. To kickstart the process, the chairperson has to be a sitting or a former judge of the Supreme Court or a High Court. But the scales on offer just donâ€™t match what a Supreme Court justice would get. Though the government was keen on appointing a Supreme Court justice, the finance department did not initially agree to upgrading the scales.

So, Neta â€” as the acronym goes â€” just had to wait. A scaled down version of the original grand dream of â€˜â€˜green benchesâ€™â€™ which would look at the whole gamut of rehabilitation issues, Neta was meant to provide for â€˜â€˜strict liabilityâ€™â€™ for damages from any accident while handling hazardous substances.

The national tribunal, with a provision for benches, would have been guided by the principles of natural justice, with powers to regulate its own procedures. It would, says one official, have been less expensive than the average court case â€” and, most importantly, sent a strong message to polluters. The Act has provisions for imprisonment and fine for any breach of orders.

â€˜â€˜It was a good law,â€™â€™ says an official. â€˜â€˜The

concept of civil liability was to be operated through this Actâ€™â€™ â€” rather than the existing overburdened courts. And, â€˜â€˜effective and

expeditious disposalâ€™â€™ of cases, aimed at giving relief and compensation for damages to a person, property and environment, would have been sorely needed relief.

All this is yet to be.
