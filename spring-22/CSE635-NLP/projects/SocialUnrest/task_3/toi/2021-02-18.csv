0,Sena-BJP will find the going tough in LS polls,"MUMBAI: The Shiv Sena-BJP alliance will have an uphill task in Maharashtra in the Lok Sabha elections while taking on the Congress-Nationalist Congress party (NCP) combine.

A review of the poll statistics for the state shows that themajority vote has always favoured the Congress and its splinter groups.

While the unified Congress has invariably secured over 40 per cent of the popular vote in the LS elections, except for the 1996 rout, the saffron alliance had only once scored more than 40 per cent of the votes.

This was for the 1998 election but strangely, its tally of seats suffered since Sharad Pawar, then in theCongress, had brought all anti-saffron elements under one umbrella.

The picture changed completely within a year in 1999 since Mr Pawar had formed the NCP by then and waged a battle against the Congress on the one hand and with the Sena-BJP alliance on the other.

The result was that the Sena could win 15 and the BJP 13 LS seats, although the total number of votes polled by the saffron alliance suffered. In the 1999 LS election, the Congress won a miserable ten seats while the NCP won just six seats although their votes were much more than the saffron alliance.

The Congress, with its 29.70 per cent topped the list in terms of the percentage of votes polled, followed by the NCP at 21.57 per cent. Together, their vote total was 51.27 per cent against the saffron score of 38 per cent. But the NDA had 28 seats from Maharashtra against the Congress-NCPâ€™s 16.

This became possible only because of a three-way splitting of the votes for which Mr Pawar was blamed. It was alleged that he had been helping out the NDA indirectly.

The saffron alliance won the following seats solely owing to the split in the opposition votes despite the fact that its voting per cent had decreased in these constituencies: Parbhani, Aurangabad, Osmanabad, Kopargaon, Washim , Ramtek, Thane, Nashik, Buldana and Chimur.

In spite of the three-way split, the Congress stood second in these constituencies: Mumbai north-east, Thane, Dahanu, Dhule, Jalgaon, Buldana, Vashim, Ramtek, Bhandara, Parbhani, Jalna, Aurangabad and Pune. Similarly, the NCP stood second in Ratnagiri, Nashik, Erandol, Beed, Osmanabad, Ahmednagar and Kopargaon. Together, these 20 seats will play a dominant role in the 2004 LS election.

1,SP will rally for non-kolis today,"MUMBAI: Resisting opposition to north-indian migrants seeking employment in the city, Samajwadi Party has decided to launch a dharna on Thursday to protest against attempts to bar nonkolis from buying and selling fish.

Scores of non-Maharashtrians, who had taken up to selling fish as their livelihood, were expected to participate in the dharna, under the leadership of SPMP, Abu Asim Azmi.

â€œOur constitution has empowered each one with the right to travel, reside and seek employment in any part of the country,â€™â€™ said Zulfikar Ahmed Azmi, member of the samajwadi machli vikreta sangh, Mumbai. â€œThe decision to ban north-indians from purchasing and buying fish was unfair,â€™â€™ he added.

â€œThe dharna would try to highlight on our right to seek employment in any part of the countryâ€™â€™, he said. The agitating members would also submit a memorandum to the chief minister.

2,"LIC will lend Rs 1,000 cr to state govt","MUMBAI: The Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) has decided to lend Rs 1,000 crore to the cash-starved Maharashtra government for development of social infrastructure works, including the completion of irrigation and water supply projects.

The decision taken by the LICâ€™s investment committee on Monday has brought much relief to the chief minister Sushilkumar Shindeâ€™s ministry, which is already burdened with a debt exceeding Rs 95,000 crore.

The ruling Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party camps are particularly upbeat with this development as it could not have happened at a more opportune time.

With the two political parties gearing up for general elections, the funds are likely to be allocated for projects taken up by the lossmaking Maharashtra Krishna Valley Development Corporation (MKVDC) in the western Maharashtra belt.

The region is significant to the two coalition partners as a majority of its ministers and MLAs come from western Maharashtra and are facing a tough-time in their backyards because of a drought situation and incomplete irrigation works.

It is expected that the funds will be utilised to take up small irrigation works in the MKVDC area and to speedily complete projects which are running much behind their schedule for want of funds.

The LIC, however, had earlier rejected any assistance to the state government for MKVDC where the project costs have more than doubled because of political interference and inflated quotations by the contractors.

The LICâ€™s investment committee met on Monday and agreed to sanction Rs 1,000 crore to the Maharashtra government after the Centre consented to it. â€œThe loan will be released in two instalments of Rs 500 crore each and the state will be charged 10 per cent interest on the amount, which is payable in 10 years,â€™â€™ said R.N. Bharadwaj, managing director of the LIC.

3,"Another hospital, courtesy polls","KOLKATA: The venue: Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose Road at Tollygunge in south Kolkata. The promise: A 300-bed hospital, within a year. The scene: A half-finished two-storeyed structure with about 250 shopkeepers in the ground floor.

Union minister Mamata Banerjee was scheduled to lay the foundation stone of the hospital, to be set up by Rammohan Mission, at 4 pm on Wednesday. Almost halfan-hour before the scheduled time, people were seen giving finishing touches to the plaque that the minister would unveil. A white paint was hastily put, a silk piece of cloth was placed on the tablet and the show was ready.

Come elections, and it is the season to lay foundation stones. The Lok Sabha poll was kept behind the veil on Wednesday, but Mamata waxed eloquent on the need for a modern hospital in the locality. Rammohan Mission representatives promised that 10 per cent of the beds would be kept free for poor patients. The only jarring note was the 250-odd shopkeepers in a makeshift market. Trinamul Congress MLA Pankaj Banerjee promised that the shopkeepers would not be evicted. Mamata, however, felt a hospital should not be set up on top of a market as this might disturb patients.

The traders present at the function submitted a memorandum to Mamata requesting against eviction. â€œThe problem of the market must be settled before the hospital is set up,â€� the minister said. She suggested to set up a separate block for the market, and that the mission should seek Hudcoâ€™s help in this regard.

Mayor Subrata Mukherjee too was present to give his â€œblessingsâ€�. An hour ago, he had presided over a meeting of the Kolkata Municipal Corporation mayor-in-council members where the rollback in the enhanced water tax was formally approved along with restoration of inheritance right of shopkeepers in KMC markets and the setting up of a graveyard for Muslims near the Bypass, as promised by Mamata at Topsia last week.

4,Few checks in corporation fast-track building laws,"KOLKATA: Realtors might be elated with Kolkata Municipal Corporationâ€™s decision to sanction building plans within a fortnight, but some civic engineers and architects feel that the move is hasty and ill planned.

There are just not enough safety checks in place to make the simplification foolproof, though some of the clauses in the fast-track building sanction procedure seem impregnable. Anyone who wants to avail of the fast-track facility has to give an undertaking that the corporation will have the right to demolish the unauthorised portions of the building if he deviates from the original plan, KMC officials say. And builders will have a trying time obtaining a stay on the demolition drive from a higher court.

There are some key deviations from the fast-track building sanction laws in Bangalore and Pune, which are apparently the framework of the new laws in Kolkata. Queries made by TNN to the civic authorities in Bangalore and Pune revealed that their norms were more scientific than the proposed â€œspeedyâ€� sanctioning of building plans by KMC.

Both Bangalore and Pune municipal corporations have set up a special cell for fasttrack sanction. In Pune, building department inspectors even go around collecting building plans from the architects. This is part of the plan where the architect, rather than the builder, is made responsible for any unauthorised construction. The apparent logic is that it would be easier to track down an architect, whose licence is under threat of being cancelled, than a truant realtor.

KMC engineers feel that KMC-empannneled licensed building surveyors (LBS) be made responsible for deviations in building plans. Director-general (buildings) Ashok Roychowdhury is leading a team to the two cities soon to get a first-hand experience of the building laws there.

BANGALORE Introduced the Sulabh Naksha Yojana a year ago after constituting a special cell for sanctioning building plans within 24 hours. It made architects responsible for illegal constructions

PUNE introduced the same scheme in August last year with a special cell sanctioning building plans within 48 hours. Here, too, architects were made responsible for illegal constructions.

5,It's make-or-break time for Cong party,"LUCKNOW: With Congress having failed to ink any pact with the BSP as yet, the state Congress is in for some major problems.

Muslim leaders in the party are already having a rethink about their stand. Some of the better-known faces have either quit or are on the verge of quitting the party, dashing all hopes of the grand Congress revival by riding the wave of a formidable Muslim-dalit combine.

And, even as the party stalwarts are hard-pressed to think of ways to check the exodus, the simmering insecurity among Muslims in the Congress has come as a boon to the BSP which has moved in swiftly to make a killing out of it.

Already, in a well-calculated strategy, the BSP''s gang of three â€” controversial former minister for environment Naseemuddin, high profile son-in-law of Maulana Bukhari Rashid Alvi, MP from Amroha and Daud Ahmad, the Shahabad MP â€” have been entrusted with the job of identifying, and focusing on, soft targets

The three, informed sources claim, are in touch with half a dozen prominent Congressmen and also negotiating with a few Muslims MLAs in the Samajwadi Party. Sources also named as a possible convert to BSP a prominent Muslim MP from the Samajwadi Party whose glacial vibes with the CM had earlier led to much speculation.

The next few days may actually make or break the Congress in UP, confided a concerned party leader. Mayawati''s meeting with Sonia Gandhi three days ago has come as a face-saver as party leaders have been consoling the rank and file with the all-is-not-lost line.

Senior leaders also sound highly optimistic as they interpret the meeting as Behanji''s olive branch to Sonia. ""The BSP supremo, under the BJP pressure,"" a top party leader told TNN, ""will open her cards in our favour at the eleventh hour and we are waiting.""

The trickle of desertions, state leaders claim, is of no consequence even as political observers dub it as a danger sign. Prominent among those who have left are Akbar Ahmad Dumpy and Talat Aziz who joined the blue brigade last week.

Waiting in the queue are former MP Mohammad Muqeem whose supporters had a free-for-all with supporters of UPCC chief Jagdambika Pal at Dumariyaganj during the Congress president''s road show in the constituency last fortnight. Sources also hint at strong chances of Afroz Khan, former MLA from Rampur and a close aid of Salman Khurshid, of quitting the sinking ship.

""The trend has just begun and it will gather momentum in the coming week if the BSP finally chooses to spurn the pre-poll advances of the Congress Party,"" they claim.

6,Fertiliser scam: Centre blames it on state govt,"LUCKNOW: The Central government has made a sensational disclosure in Rs 1200 crore fertiliser subsidy scam in Uttar Pradesh by admitting that about Rs 200 crore were ''misappropriated'' by 29 fertiliser units in the state.

In an affidavit filed with the Lucknow bench of the Allahabad High Court, the Centre claimed that ""the total amount of concession on sales of SSP (Single Super Phosphate) during the period 1994-95 to 1999-2000 by UP-based units would be approximately Rs 200 crore."" Taking the scam seriously, the Centre has blamed the state for inordinate delay in completing the inquiries and issued fresh directives to start taking actions against officials and owners of factories who were found involved into the multi-crore fertiliser subsidy scam.

The scam was detected in 2000 and the state government had handed over the probe to economic offence wing (EOW) and the SIB, Agriculture. During the investigation, it was found that 29 fertiliser units in the state had inflated their production of SSP without buying adequate rock phosphate to claim hefty amounts as subsidy from the Centre. Several hundred crores were claimed as subsidy from the Centre showing production beyond their capacity.

On submission of the report by the EOW and the SIB, FIRs were lodged against seven senior officials of the state agriculture department and chargesheets were served on seven units. The FIRs were also lodged against 10 other units. But, before the agencies could carry out further probe, the then Mayawati government abolished SIB on January 1, 2003 through a GO apparently to save UP officials and few big units involved in the scam. Although the state government had assured to hand over cases to different state investigating agencies, but since then no progress has been made in this regard.

""The government is out to save the officials and big shots who are owners of these factories. The Income tax department has already submitted a detailed report to the state of UP as well Centre in the scam way back in 1999 then why no action was taken against them till date?"" questioned Vishwa Nath Chaturvedi, a Congress leader and petitioner.

The Congress party seems to be taking a lot of interest in the case as a few leaders of the rival parties are likely to be exposed in the scam. The party has engaged a senior and prominent Supreme Court counsel MC Bhandare who would appear on behalf of the petitioner on Thursday when the case comes up for hearing at the Lucknow bench of the Allahabad High Court.

8,BJP 'sacrifices' minister for TN seat-sharing,"NEW DELHI: The BJP has ''sacrificed'' Union minister of state for communications S Thiruna-vukkarassu to ensure that its electoral tie-up with the AIADMK goes through smoothly in Tamil Nadu.

On Wednesday, when the poll panels of the two parties decided on the division of seats â€” 33 for the AIADMK and the remaining seven for the BJP in Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry â€” Pudukottai, the seat held by Thirunavukkarassu, was not on the BJP''s list of seven.

To the BJP''s lot has fallen Pondicherry, Chennai (North), Chidambaram (SC), Dharmapuri, Nilgiris, Coimbatore and Nagercoil, of which the party won the last three in the 1999 Lok Sabha polls.

Reports from Chennai quoted BJP''s TN chief C P Radhakrishnan as saying that though the party had not got Pudukottai, it was ""fully satisfied"" since in any alliance, every party had to adopt a ""give and take"" approach.

But party sources say that the BJP tried till the very last to secure Pudukottai as it was confident of winning the seat.

AIADMK supremo Jayalali-thaa has been determined from the start not to give the seat to the BJP.

9,Naik rules out ONGC stock split before float,"MUMBAI: The ministry of petroleum and natural gas on Wednesday ruled out the possibility of splitting the ONGC stock before the public sale of 10 per cent of the governmentâ€™s stake in the nationâ€™s most valuable company. â€˜â€˜So far as the petroleum ministry is concerned, there will be no stock split in ONGC before the offer,â€™â€™ minister Ram Naik said.

Earlier, there were reports that to ensure a large retail participation in the governmentâ€™s planned divestment of 10 per cent of ONGC shares in March, the company may split each of its shares of Rs 10 par value into five shares of Rs 2 each. The government holds an 84 per cent stake in the petroleum exploration and production company.

The minister remained non-committal on the issue of a discounted offer price for retail investors in the ONGC and Gail issues, saying that decision was the prerogative of the group of secretaries and the financial advisors to the two offers.

Asked about the status of the report by a committee appointed to probe the crash of an ONGC-chartered helicopter in August that killed more than 20 people, Naik said two interim reports had already been tabled and the final report was awaited. ONGC officials said the company had since raised its security standards.

Meanwhile, in a bid to become a $100 billion integrated oil and gas major in five years, ONGC proposed setting up seven non-government firms to manage its marketing, drilling, LNG, logistics, shipping and petrochemical businesses under a new corporate structure.

ONGC has proposed holding a 50 per cent stake in all seven JVs, while offering the rest to FIs and strategic partners in each of those businesses, it said.

As per the new structure, there would be a V-C and MD each for the firmâ€™s exploration and production and its overseas businesses under ONGC Videsh.

5% discount on IPCL IPO

NEW DELHI: The government has announced a five per cent discount on a floor price of Rs 170 for each of its 5.9 crore shares in petrochem firm IPCL it intends to offload from February 20.

Discount for retail investors is being offered for the first time in India and is an effort to sell the disinvestment process itself among the masses by distributing the spoils as widely as possible.

The discount will make the bluechip shares affordable for small investors.

Disinvestment minister Arun Shourie said the five per cent discount on the floor price practically works out to a 10 per cent discount of the scripâ€™s six-month average price of Rs 188.

There would also be no lock-in period for small investors.

10,Tribals launch new party in Kerala,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The Adivasi Gotra Mahasabha (AGM), a tribal forum of the hilly Wayanad district, on Thursday formed a political party named Adivasi Mahasabha, ""to put an end to the exploitation of the tribals by political parties"".

Announcing the birth of the new party in Kochi on Thursday, adivasi leader C K Janu said, the new political party emerged out of the realisation that it was necessary to become a vote bank to achieve the basic demands of the tribals in Kerala.

Janu alleged that the political parties become interested only in Adivasis at the time of polls. ""This situation will not be allowed to continue,"" she said. Referring to the recent Killi episode where the government took immediate action against erring police officials, Janu said that it was not out of any love for the affected Muslim families that the government took stern action. ""They realized that if action is not taken, the state culture minister and local MLA G Karthikeyan would lose the Muslim vote next time,"" she pointed out.

The announcement was made on the anniversary day of the Muthanga firing. Tribals under the leadership of Janu had forcibly occupied Muthanga forests and held hostage forest personnel.

The police used force to get the government employees released in which many tribals were seriously hurt and two lost lives.
