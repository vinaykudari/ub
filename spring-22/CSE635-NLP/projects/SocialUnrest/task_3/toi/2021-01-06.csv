0,Mudit Verma arrested,"LUCKNOW: Mudit Verma, former chairman of UP Cooperative Awas Sangh, was arrested by the Hazratganj police on Tuesday in connection with an FIR lodged against him by the administration of the UP Cooperative Housing Corporation Limited on December 2 for investing in the Mansarover Cooperative Bank while flouting government orders in this regard.

Verma had deposited crores of rupees of the Awas Sangh in the Mansarovar Cooperative Bank when he was chairman of the Awas Sangh. He also had flouted orders for becoming the managing director of the Awas Sangh. Significantly, he was also one of the promoters of the Mansarovar Cooperative Bank. A case has also been registered against the bank. Verma was arrested from his Mal Avenue residence. Police also took some papers into custody.

According to the FIR lodged with the police, Verma in the capacity of chairman of the Awas Sangh deposited Rs 1.40 crore as â€˜call deposit'' for 25 days on June 20, 2001 with the Mansarovar Cooperative Bank. The bank paid back the money with 10.5 per cent interest, but since it was not put to utilisation through reinvestment, Awas Sangh suffered a loss of Rs 158,566.

The investment was in violation of the state government order which prohibits investment in cooperative banks, except for the UP Cooperative Banks and the District Cooperative Banks. There were also allegations against Verma in the FIR that he flouted norms during the management committee meeting of the Awas Sangh held on June 28, 2001 and also took the post of managing director.

After assuming the charge of managing director, he again was instrumental in depositing Rs 7.83 crore of the Awas Sangh in the Mansarovar Cooperative Bank. Thereafter, on October 29, 2001, he withdrew Rs 25 lakh of the Awas Sangh from the Bombay Mercantile Bank and also deposited it in Mansaorvar Cooperative Bank. As per the FIR, a total of Rs 9.17 crore were deposited as FDRs and Rs 1.23 crore as call deposits in the Mansarovar Cooperative Bank, which were never paid back.

Meanwhile, investigations were also under way against Verma for misappropriation of funds and flouting rules and regulations to benefit several cooperative societies and business establishments in the state besides producing inflated bills allegedly for siphoning off the Awas Sangh money. Sources said that action would follow against other officials of the Awas Sangh who were instrumental along with Verma in alleged misappropriations.

1,"SIT probe is protecting ministers, alleges Gote","PUNE: Arrested Samajwadi Janata Party MLA Anil Gote on Tuesday levelled sensational allegations against the special investigation team (SIT), claiming it was trying to protect former deputy chief minister Chhagan Bhujbal and revenue minister Ashok Chavan in the multi-crore-rupee fake stamp paper case.

This was alleged by Gote in the say filed in the court of special judge S.M. Shembole on Tuesday, in reply to an application in which the SIT has asked the court to keep the four accused â€” Gote, assistant police inspector Dilip Kamat, advocate Rashid Kulkarni and Azim Telgi â€” in separate jails.

Gote has alleged that the SIT application could affect the whole case. â€œIt may put a question mark on all investigations by the SIT,â€� the application stated. He charged that investigations were carried out arbitrarily against a few â€œinnocentâ€� persons like him, to protect the â€œreal culpritsâ€� like Bhujbal, Chavan and the authorities who issued the licenses to Telgi.

Gote also questioned the need for separate jails when the SIT claims that investigations are to finish in a monthâ€™s time. Kamat, Kulkarni and Telgi have time till

2,Karnataka ministers favour joint elections,"BANGALORE: A majority of Karnataka ministers have reportedly favoured simultaneous elections to the Legislative Assembly and Lok Sabha if the dates of the latter are advanced.

The senior ministers, attending a meeting convened by chief minister S.M. Krishna here on Tuesday that lasted 45 minutes, are said to have discussed merits and demerits of simultaneous polls and the prospects of holding them on schedule in September 2004. â€œThe CM wanted to have an idea if the issue were to come up at the CWC meeting scheduled in Delhi on Wednesday,â€™â€™ sources told The Times of India.

It is learnt most ministers felt if the Lok Sabha elections are advanced to April-May, the gap before the Assembly goes to polls will be just four months. Advancing poll dates is expected to be discussed at the BJPâ€™s national executive committee in Hyderabad on January 11.

A senior minister from north Karnataka is reported to have suggested that Karnataka should be firm about completing its full term. â€œBut the CM pointed out that the Election Commission has constitutional powers to order for simultaneous elections if the gap between two polls is less than six months,â€™â€™ the sources stated.

But the main concern for the present government in the event of early elections is that power and water crises will be at their peak in April-May. The state has faced three consecutive droughts and the spectre of a fourth looms large. â€œBesides, summer will be severe in Karnataka unlike in the north where the temperatures soar to a maximum in May last week,â€™â€™ a minister said. Anticipating early polls, Krishna has advanced the state budget to the second week of February, ahead of the Union budget.

Krishna has been declaring that the Congress is â€œever readyâ€™â€™ to face polls whenever held but has been discounting the possibility of his opting for Assemblyâ€™s early dissolution. KPCC president B. Janardhana Poojary has time and again stated that the BJP will go in for early polls and that Karnataka should be prepared for it.

3,Left parties gear up to make bandh a success,"PATNA: Left parties have geared up to make the Bihar bandh, slated for January 7, a great success. The Left parties have given a call for the statewide bandh to protest the rising crime graph and growing nexus between politicians-police-criminals which has made the common man''s life miserable in Bihar. The Left parties have also demanded the release of former DGP, D P Ojha''s report on Md Shahabuddin.

Party workers of all the Left parties including CPI, CPM, CPI(ML), SUCI, RSP, MCPI and Forward Bloc were seen moving in different localities in the state capital and in its outskirts such as Paliganj, Maner, Bikram, Naubatpur, Dhanarua, Masaurhi, Punpun and Fatuha appealing to the people to make the bandh a success.

Various political and trade organisations, Nationalist Congress Party, Sampoorna Vikas Dal, Bihar Motor Transport Federation (BMTF) and Bihar Vyavsayee Sangharsh Morcha have extended support to the bandh. Essential services have been kept out of the purview of the bandh.

CPI(ML) activists have claimed that the entire bazaar in Dulhinbazar, Paliganj, Bikram-Bihta, Masaurhi and Dhanarua would remain closed and all the vehicular traffic would be disrupted during the dawn-to-dusk bandh. Besides, hundreds of villagers have already left for the state capital to show solidarity with the Left cause.

While condemning the Arwal massacre, Bihar Socialist Front has decided to extend full support to the Left-sponsored bandh. Activists of the Democratic Youth Federation of India organised street â€˜sabha'' at Science College, Patna College, Darbhanga House, Engineering College and B N College to mobilise students'' support for the Bihar bandh. SUCI leaders hand held meetings in Nala Road and Rajendra Nagar to make aware people of the cause for which the call for bandh was given.

Rlys take precautions: The railways have made elaborate security arrangements in the Danapur division of the East Central Railway (ECR), keeping in view the bandh call given by the Left and other political parties on Wednesday.

According to sources, all vital installations of the railways will be carefully guarded and patrolling on the tracks will be carried out roundthe-clock.

A close vigil will be maintained at all major bridges and railway armedforces will escort the trains passing and orginating from the division, sources said, adding that the trouble-torn places of the division will be strictly brought under close surveillance of the railway armed forces.

4,Road blocked to protest theft in jewellery shop,"PATNA: A theft was committed in a jewellery shop, Mahesh Lal Pappu Jewellers, in the Sadikpur area under the Alamganj police station here on Monday night in which property, including gold ornaments, worth about Rs 4 lakh was stolen.

Protesting against the incident, local businessmen and residents blocked the main road at least for four hours. According to the police, criminals entered the shop after breaking open at least seven locks. Evidence available on the spot suggested the involvement of a gang specialising in committing thefts at jewellery shops.

""The criminals took away mostly costly items from the shop,"" said Patna City DSP Arvind Gupta. Police sources said gangs from different states, including West Bengal,which specialise in committing crimes at jewellery shops, visit Patna every year. Angry over the delay in arrival of the police at the shop, local businessmen and residents blocked the main road demanding immediate arrest of the criminals involved in the incident.

The shop is situated close to the Sadikpur police outpost. They lifted the blockade after an assurance was given by the police that the criminals would be arrested as soon as possible.

5,"No environment minister yet, activists see red","NEW DELHI: For a fortnight, the country has been without an environment minister â€” and nobody seems to care.

Since the DMKâ€™s Baalu resigned from his ministership in December, the cabinet-rank position has remained vacant. Amid speculation on an early election and dissolution of the Lok Sabha later this month, nobody has even been given additional charge. Decisions, if any, would have to be taken by a Prime Minister who is busy with party and policy matters as he heads into an election year.

When Parliament was still in session, written answers went in the name of Mamata Banerjee, a minister still without portfolio. But that was it.

For a ministry reeling at the loss of three bigwigs in one year â€” a minister, a minister of state filmed taking money and a secretary whose name was dragged into the Taj scandal â€” this is the last straw.

Environmentalists and conservationists, even officials, are contrasting todayâ€™s situation with the priority given to environment issues by the Congress and the Gandhi family.

The ministership wasnâ€™t given to political lightweights, they say. Nor were issues given the go-by as they are today.

Says Sunita Narain, head of the Delhi-based NGO Centre for Science and Environment, â€˜â€˜If the finance minister was missing, action would have been taken to replace him. Environment is clearly not in the list of priorities for a government which doesnâ€™t realise that ecological security will be as important as financial security in the years to come.â€™â€™

Conservationist Ashok Kumar agrees. â€˜â€˜It shows what little importance this government gives to environment and wildlife. Decision-making has come to an end,â€™â€™ he echoes.

Ravi Agarwal of Toxics Link says the vaccuum â€˜â€˜shows the lack of focus on environment issues which are becoming so critical today. It may seem like a second-rung portfolio but the issues are so critical that in a feel-good situation, this is the feel-bad factor. We need much better policies on the environment.â€™â€™ Anybody listening?

6,"For CPI, elections a battle to survive","NEW DELHI: The No. 2 party in the first three general elections has now just two members in the Lok Sabha. After the death of Bhan Singh Bhaura, the MP from Bhatinda, last week, the Communist Party of India (CPI) has been reduced to a two-MP party.

If the CPI does not do well in the coming general elections, it could well lose the status of a national party. Even now, the party does not fulfil the Election Commissionâ€™s criteria for being a national party: six per cent of votes polled in any four states along with at least four seats in Lok Sabha or two per cent of the total Lok Sabha seats (11 MPs) from at least three states. In the 1999 elections, the party had two seats from West Bengal and one from Punjab.

Of course, it has never been the same for Nehruâ€™s principal Opposition party since the debilitating split of 1964. Party general secretary

A B Bardhan admits there has been an electoral downturn in the last three general elections.

Bardhan explained: â€˜â€˜Which party has gone from strength to strength? I donâ€™t think there has been a decline for CPI, these are only temporary electoral setbacks. Communalism and casteism have affected all the parties. Muslims and Harijans who were traditionally with the Congress are no longer so. The CPI could not stand the communal propanganda.â€™â€™

He admits that the CPM has largely been unaffected by communalism because it has been better organised and also because it has been in power for so long in West Bengal.

7,AICC leader slams Centre's disinvestment policy,"DHARAMSALA: The All India Congress Committee (AICC) secretary, Jai Kishen Sharma alleged here on Wednesday that NDA government''s disinvestment policy was detrimental to the country''s economy.

Addressing mediapersons, Sharma who is currently touring all the districts of Himachal Pradesh to get first hand information about party''s preparations for the Lok Sabha polls, said that mindless disinvestment by BJP-led government at Centre was not in the interest of the country adding that even profitable public sector units had been sold to the private sector.

Sharma further alleged that Vajpayee-led government was pursuing anti-people policies, due to which the progress of the country has suffered.

Sharma alleged that NDA government was giving step-motherly treatment to Himachal Pradesh by stopping liberal financial assistance to the state.

He asserted that the BJP had never contested any of the elections on a real issue pertaining to problems faced by the people of the country. He stressed that BJP had thrived on issues like Gnaga, Gau, Ram Rajya and Ram Mandir to whip the passions and emotions of the electorate for winning elections.

The AICC secretary alleged that BJP indulges in unfair tactics in the Congress- dominated states at the time of elections by resorting to fake voting and other manipulative tactics to win the polls.

He said that the BJP was training its workers to indulge in similar tactics for Lok Sabha polls, which could be held earlier than scheduled.

Sharma asked Congress workers to tour villages and far-flung areas to tell the people about its anti-people polices and expose its real face.

Sharma said that the Virbhadra government despite unfriendly attitude of the NDA government at Centre was doing a decent job. He said that Congress workers should make the people of the state including villages informed about state government''s policies and programmes.

He further emphasized that Congress was ready for Lok Sabha polls whether they are

held on schedule or before.
