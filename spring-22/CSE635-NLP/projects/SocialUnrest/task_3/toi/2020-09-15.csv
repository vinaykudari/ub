0,Squad of vice: When the law turns outlaw,"NEW DELHI: Naresh Kumar Jindal was aghast to receive a call from a station house officer on his mobile on September 2 night. Jindal, a resident of Dilshad Garden, claimed the police officer threatened him because he had approached the deputy commissioner of police (DCP) to lodge a protest against the SHO.

Jindal, a businessman, was so intimidated that he left his home the same night and went to a friendâ€™s house in Paharganj from where he sent a fax to the police commissionerâ€™s office.

When there was no reply, Jindal made a call to the police control room. Although an officer of Public Greivance from north-east visited him, there was no action. Jindal has now moved the vigilance department expecting action.

â€˜â€˜I was forced to visit the DCP after the SHO refused to register a case against one of my employees who robbed me two months ago,â€™â€™ Jindal alleged. Jindal is one of several victims of police apathy and terror.

A recall of past incidents reflects how extortion, threats and harassment are fast becoming synonymous with Delhi Police.Last year, the police had registered a case against South Extension resident, Manjeet Singh. The case was registered at the instance of a smack addict who attempted to steal something from Singhâ€™s shop. A police officer said: â€�Singh had to bear the brunt of the situation because he had started a campaign against the police for facilitating unauthorised construction.â€™â€™

While concluding that the case against Singh was improper, a vigilance officer said: â€˜â€˜It is important to judge the credibility of complainant who is a smack addict and a thief.â€™â€™ Following the vigilance inquiry, a sub-inspector and SHO were under doubt.

There have been instances where police officials have also managed to escape punishment after committing an offence. On April 10 this year, two constables reportedly robbed two businessmen of Rs 17 lakh worth diamonds. While constable Jarnail Singh was arrested, his colleague escaped. The case has been transferred to the crime branch, but the co-accused is yet to be arrested.

In another case involving police officials, a non-resident Indian was robbed of US $ 500 two months ago.

The victim reached his home in Punjab and lodged a complaint with police commissioner on telephone. A vigilance inquiry is still pending.

1,Documentary makers protest Films Division censorship,"BANGALORE: Taking up the ongoing nation-wide campaign, makers of films, documentaries and short films in Karnataka have decided to boycott the Mumbai International Film Festival (Miff) 2004, to protest the censorship of documentaries sought by the Films Division.

A press release said Delhi film makers had already registered their protest that censorship would be applied for the first time ever to documentaries screened at film festivals. Foreign films, however, are exempt from any censorship.

""It is an accepted practice world-wide that film festivals are arenas of uninhibited and creative expression. No international festival of repute censors films. It is strange that Miff2004 now wants to do this, while it managed seven previous editions without this regulation,"" the release said.

Top Karnataka film makers who will boycott the festival include Girish Kasaravalli, Pattabhirama Reddy, M.S. Sathyu, Girish Karnad and Kavitha Lankesh, along with 23 short film makers, while artist S.G. Vasudev and theatre director S. Prasanna and eight organisations including Vimochana, Samudaaya and Bangalore Film Society have lent their support to the cause, the release said.

2,Police busts riot-reprisal network,"AHMEDABAD: The Anti-Terrorist Squad (ATS) of Gujarat police claimed to have busted a network based in the Himmatnagar taluka of Sabarkantha which had allegedly masterminded the riot reprisals after the post-Godhra incidents that sparked off state-wide communal riots last year.

Special Inspector-General of Police (ATS) Vipul Vijoy Singh said: â€˜â€˜This group held meetings in March 2002 to plan the riot reprisals and even distributed weapons to those who could not afford.â€™â€™

3,Residents protest 'torture' in police custody,"CHANDIGARH: The city police were taken unawares when on Monday morning a number of residents blocked roads and burnt tyres in protest against the alleged torture of a youth in police custody.

The police had to resort to mild lathi-charge to clear the blockades and were pelted with stones at one of the sites.

Contrary to the announced plan, the protesters, belonging to ""Balmiki Samaj"", sat on a dharna at around 7.30 am, blocking roads dividing Sectors 14/25, 25/24 and 25/38.

They used sewerage pipes and burnt tyres to block the roads. The motorists who were going to schools, colleges and hospitals had to take a detour.

As the information reached senior police officers, the SHOs of the areas concerned were rushed to the spot with additional force in tow.

When efforts to disperse them failed, the police removed them forcibly through mild cane-charge. The protesters mostly belonged to Sector 25 colonies.

Senior police officers, including two DSPs and three SHOs, reached the spot and after a few hours, the protesters were allowed to leave in vehicles for the venue of their protest, Rose Garden roundabout.

The protesters, who had originally planned to assemble at Nehru Park, Sector 22, gathered near the Rose Garden roundabout.

In the end, only a handful of protesters, comprising mostly, children and women marched, carrying placards and raising slogans against the Chandigarh police.

After reaching the venue, they burnt an effigy of a policeman and went on to submit a memorandum to the UT administrator, seeking quick action against the ""guilty"" police officers.

A Sector 25 resident, Ashok Kumar, had accused two sub-inspectors of torturing him and demeaning his caste.

Ashok told Times News Network that on August 15, he was attacked by certain persons.

When he informed the police, instead of taking action against the accused, the police registered a case against him and allegedly tortured him.

UT SSP Gaurav Yadav then ordered an inquiry by a DSP into the episode, which is yet not complete.

The protesters demanded the inquiry be completed and the guilty police officers be brought to book.

A section of the police, on the other hand maintained that Ashok was a ""bad character"" as he had been convicted in many criminal cases and that his complaint was motivated.

6 of them held The city police arrested six protesters in two separate cases registered at the Sectors 11 and 39 police stations, on charges of rioting, causing nuisance and obstruction in public way. They were let off on bail later.

4,"Kokje acts, tells govt to review proposals","SHIMLA: Governor V S Kokje on Monday returned the proposed ordinance seeking amendments to the Himachal Pradesh University Act, with valid reasons for reconsideration by the government.

The ordinance had been sent to the governor in the first week of September for immediate promulgation.

Though the Raj Bhawan officials were tight-lipped on the issue and the governor was unavailable for comments, reliable sources said that Kokje, being a legal luminary, may have raised some legal points which could avoid unnecessary criticism from various sections, including the opposition.

The governor has reportedly taken the plea that reasons for the amendments to the Act may not meet the requirements of justice and fall flat if challenged in a court of law by any individual or university staff.

Earlier, former CM Prem Kumar Dhumal had claimed that the proposed amendments were being included to accommodate a particular person and not for the overall better management of the university.

HPU has been embroiled in a few scams involving various officials, including vice-chancellor (VC) S D Sharma. The governor had constituted two enquiries in financial and administrative matters.

The state vigilance department had also filed corruption cases against the VC and deputy registrar (secrecy) P N Bharadwaj.

The two officers, and some others had also been grilled by a vigilance team.

The cabinet, in its meeting on September 5, had decided to incorporate a new section 9 (b) in the Act to empower it to institute an inquiry into the financial and administrative matters of the university.

6,State drops sedition case against ML protesters,"PATNA: The Bihar government has finally taken the Darbhanga police to task for lodging a case of sedition against four CPI(ML) workers for allegedly showing black flags to deputy PM L K Advani on August 16.

While instructions have been given for withdrawal of the sedition charge against the four, the state DGP has been asked to issue a show-cause notice to the Darbhanga SP.

The ML has been agitating against the police move and intellectualise from across the country had written to the chief minister to withdraw the sedition charge. On Monday, The Times of India carried a report, quoting legal experts and political leaders who questioned the police move to book someone under the IPC Section pertaining to sedition.

Ruling RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav said DGP D P Ojha has been asked to issue a show-cause to the Darbhanga SP as to how sedition charges were framed against the four workers.

""Showing black flags does not amount to sedition. I have also been shown black flags several times,"" he remarked.

While admitting that the police action was unjustified, Laloo told journalists here on Monday the Darbhanga district magistrate has been directed to withdraw the sedition charges.

The RJD chief insisted that his government was sensitive about human rights and would not allow the police to violate them. ""I ensured the removal of shackles of PW leader Arvind after I visited him in jail,"" he pointed out, adding that showing black flags was a democratic way of expressing protest. ML sources claimed the four persons were arrested even before they could show the black flags to the convoy of Advani on way back to the Darbhanga aerodrome. The four -- all members of the All India Students'' Association, student''s wing of the ML -- were raising slogans against Advani when they were nabbed, the ML sources said.

In response to the TOI report on Monday which quoted Laloo as having said that he was unaware about the sedition case, the ML issued an open letter to ""Bihar ke asli mukhyamantri"" (read Laloo). While questioning his claim about ignorance, the letter said minister Abdul Bari Siddiqui was accompanying Advani as the state government''s representative when the four tried to show black flags to Advani. Also, AISA activists had on September 5 stopped the cavalcade of CM Rabri Devi near the I-T roundabout demanding the withdrawal of the sedition charge.

The letter further pointed out that several well-known personalities, including Booker prize winner Arundhati Rai, had faxed messages to the CM on the issue. A memorandum was also submitted to the state home secretary.

7,"SC restrains govt from HPCL, BPCL sell-off","NEW DELHI: The NDA government''s plans to indulge in massive disinvestment of government undertakings has suffered a major set back with the Supreme Court ruling on Tuesday that the government cannot go ahead with the disinvestment of HPCL and BPCL without Parliament approval.

With this land mark ruling, all the proposals for disinvestments and privatisation of various companies created by an Act of Parliament would have to wait untill Parliament grants its approval.

The ruling will be effective immediately and would guide the future decision of the government. It would not have any effect on the disinvestment and privatisation of certain companies in the past.

Allowing the appeals filed by the Centre for Public Interest Litigation and Oil Sector Officers Association, a Bench comprising Justice S Rajendra Babu and Justice G P Mathur said the government cannot go ahead with disinvestment of the oil sector PSUs ""without appropriate parliamentary legislation.""

The Bench took note of the fact that the two companies were acquired by the government after passing an appropriate legislation in Parliament in 1974.

The Bench agreed with the petitioners - Oil Sector Officers Association (OSOA) and Centre for Public Interest Litigation (CPIL) - that the government should have approached Parliament for enacting a suitable law for privatisation of the two companies which were in 1974 acquired through a parliamentary legislation.

OSOA''s counsel, senior advocate Fali S Nariman, said the petitioner was not against the decision to privatise public sector undertakings. ""What it was opposing was the manner of privatisation of the oil PSUs which were in the strategic sector,"" he added.

Notwithstanding the pendency of petition challenging the decision to privatise the two oil refiners, the government had gone ahead with due diligence of HPCL.

Suitors for government''s 34.01 per cent stake in HPCL began due diligence on August 5. Reliance Industries Ltd was the first firm to initiate the process and after it scrutinised the books and installations, British oil and gas major BP Plc visited the data room for the due diligence.

The Supreme Court had on September 5 reserved its verdict on petitions challenging the government''s decision to privatise oil refiners Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) and Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) without seeking Parliamentary approval.

The government had prayed that the Act of Parliament nationalising various companies in 1974 were of two kinds - one which imposed a specific bar on the government to lower its stake below 51 per cent and the other which did not contemplate any such condition.

The Acts nationalising banks and coal mines specifically provided that the government at all times shall hold not less than 51 per cent of the paid up capital but similar provision was not there in the Act for nationalisation of oil PSUs.

8,SC order to affect disinvestment process: Shourie,"NEW DELHI: The government on Tuesday said the Supreme Court decision halting disinvestment of HPCL and BPCL unless there was a Parliamentary approval, would have far-reaching consequences on the sell-off process.

""It will have far-reaching consequences not only for disinvestment in these two PSUs but in other matters also,"" Disinvestment Minister Arun Shourie said from Germany.

There may be other PSUs not only at the central level but also at the state level which were created through Legislative Acts and whose disinvestment would become more difficult, Shourie said.

The government had gone ahead with the sell-off process in the two Oil PSUs after getting Attorney General''s opinion that the disinvestment of government equity in the two corporations did not require a Parliamentary nod.

10,"Long wait for 4,500 displaced govt staff","BANGALORE: Over 4,500 government employees who lost their jobs due to the Supreme court judgement on rural weightage are faced with further delay in getting fresh government jobs.

Law Minister D B Chandre Gowda told reporters here on Tuesday that hundreds of objections had been filed against the draft rules to accommodate the rural weightage employees, which would take time to consider and settle. ``We do not want to get into further litigation. So all objections will be examined in detail and a final notification will be issued on the rules. But I cannot set a timeframe for this,"" he stated.

Objections have raised doubts such as eligibility of those whose orders were issued before the cut-off date of October 11, 1998, but received their appointment letters after this. Others contended that the merit selection process was itself faulty.

""We are examining all of these. We are also holding discussions with various departments, including education, to see if posts can be created everywhere to accommodate the rural weightage candidates,"" Gowda added and appealed to all the affected to be patient.

13,"Governance workshop a big yawn for officers, ministers","GANDHINAGAR: The day-long workshop on good governance, held on Saturday last at the Ahmedabad Management Association, was an example of how both ministers and bureaucrats are increasingly getting bored with the new workshop culture that Chief Minister Narendra Modi wants to enforce.

With the exception of Modi, no minister participated in the interactive session. And of the bureaucrats, just three IAS officers, S K Nanda, Jayanthi Ravi and Kirit Shelat intervened.

Such was the lack of participation, that even former chief vigilance commissioner N Vitthal, the keynote speaker, was compelled to comment at one point that it seemed to him that no one was motivated, except the CM. Said an officer, â€œThere was so much of lecturing that only 15 minutes were left for the interactive session.â€�

This stood in sharp contrast to the two earlier workshops â€” at the Indian Institute of Management and the Kevadia Colony â€” where a large number of bureaucrats and ministers had a lot to say.

Conspicuous by his absence at the workshop was principal secretary in the Andhra Pradesh government, P K Mohanty, a 1979 batch IAS officer working in Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naiduâ€™s office. He was earlier projected as the main tutor, but it was rumoured that Mohanty had been advised not to go to Gujarat in view of the Supreme Courtâ€™s indictment of the Gujarat government and its failure to follow â€˜raj dharmaâ€™, last week.

Modiâ€™s ministers however claim there is a â€œworld of difference between good governance and raj dharma.â€� A senior BJP leader Dattaji Chitranjit said â€œraj dharma is about the personal characteristics of a king.â€�

Bureaucrats were equally evasive while openly discussing the good governance seminar, they spoke in hushed tones with each other on the futility of such exercises.

They particularly noticed how most of the speakers brought from outside praised Modi. Even Vitthal, a retired Gujarat cadre IAS official currently at the service of the AP government, said â€œYou should be happy that you have a CM who will fully support you for whatever initiative you take.â€�

Vitthal even talked of the stateâ€™s potential to become â€œglobal playerâ€�. He went on say that as far as connectivity was concerned, Gujarat was number one in IT, adding there was â€œconsiderable hype around IT in other states.â€�

But he did not fail to advise the officers to follow Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu models of reform in their effort to reform the officiadom.

Vitthalâ€™s remarks that â€œ unique advantage of an IAS officer is ignoranceâ€� and that â€œthe danger is that while IAS officers may have authority, they may lack knowledgeâ€� was particularly disliked, coming as it did from a person who did nothing to reform the state administration when he was in Gujarat.

A presentation by two young e-governance experts from Andhra Pradesh sought to explain how Naidu could targets on the basis of specific indicators for the work done by each official. A software was presented for Gujarat follow and the general administration department has been asked to look into the matter.

Two IIM professors Pradip Khandwala and DVR Sheshadri â€” praised the dispensation under Modi for following the â€œright course developmentâ€�.

14,GHB residents clash with police during civic drive,"AHMEDABAD: The Naranpura area of Ahmedabad witnessed violence when residents of the Gujarat Housing Board (GHB) flats pelted stones at an anti-encroachment squad on Tuesday afternoon.

Seven persons were detained by the police for rioting when the GHB squad initiated its demolition drive on encroachments, for which notices had already been served.

The residents of the housing colony remained adamant and tried to drive away the police and GHB personnel.

Sejal Desai (17), a resident of Parasnagar (part 1) housing society on Sola Road suffered head injuries when GHB officials demolished illegal constructions and sealed blocks of residents who had failed to pay rent.

GHBâ€™s official claimed that of the 864 flats at Parasnagar Society, 60-70 per cent of the owners have dues outstanding.

The total dues amount to nearly Rs 15 crore, with Rs 3.84 crore being the instalment dues and Rs 11.15 crore being the penal interest piled up over the last decade and more. Amounts ranging from Rs 1.5 lakh to Rs 3 lakh are due from these defaulters.

GHB officials on Tuesday demolished seven unauthorised shops built on common open plots and sealed 13 flats. Officials claimed that in spite of repeated notices, the defaulters had not paid up. In the next phase, the GHB plans to seal more flats where payments have not been made.

Angered at the way the officials carried out the operation, the residents pelted stones at the GHB and police officials. Y Brahmbhatt, spokesperson of the Gujarat Housing Board Residentsâ€™ Association, said the team was high-handed in its approach and beat up people.

â€œMy 85-year-old father-inlaw, who is paralytic, was thrown out of the house despite our repeated requests that we be given some time to take away our belongings,â€� said a resident, Gitaben Patel.

Another resident Reena Thakkar alleged that the officials misbehaved with the residents, including women.

DCP (zone I) Ajay Kumar Tomar, who was present at the site during the anti-encroachment operation, said, â€œSome stray instances stone pelting did take place during the drive, but we did not use any forceâ€� GHB officials claimed that a local MLA approached them and requested that the sealed flats be opened so that the families could go back.

But as GHBâ€™s managing director V C Patel was in Gandhinagar, this permission could not be given.

GHB officials further claimed that most of the residents may have broken the seals later and re-entered their houses. If this happened, then the GHB would lodge police complaints against them, they said.

15,Campaign norms openly violated in MSU polls,"VADODARA: Stickers, banners, cards strewn almost everywhere and disfigured walls â€” these are what greet one at the M S University (MSU) campus, with the poll fever gradually peaking here. What is surprising however, is that these materials have been banned for electioneering, as per the rules.

The rule that a candidate who employs such ways for canvassing is likely to be disqualified hardly matters to the students. Interestingly, the issue is incorporated in the notification for the university polls itself.However, more often than not, the rules are flouted openly with the university authorities looking the other way.

The notification for the union polls states, ""Election campaign, if any, shall be conducted peacefully and in a dignified manner. There shall be no canvassing by means of cards, pamphlets, leaflets, posters, loud speakers, cinema slides, disfiguring of walls and such other means and any candidate employing or causing to employ such means shall be liable to be disqualified.""

The notification, along with the rule,was issued on August 30. The process of flouting the same too began on the same date.A group supporting a faculty representative (FR) candidate in the faculty of commerce was seen sporting T-shirts with the nickname of the candidate. Several other candidates contesting key positions in MSU Students'' Union (MSUSU) as well as faculty associations employed similar means of campaigning and have got away with it so far.

A section of student leaders have complained to university authorities regarding this, but the university is yet to act. What is more interesting is that candidates deny canvassing in the said manner. ""I have not asked anyone to canvass in such a manner. But either some of my supporters may have done so without informing me or those opposing me may have done so with the idea of putting me in a tight spot,"" said NSUI candidate for the post of vice-president Rutvij Joshi.

Joshi''s own vehicle has stickers displaying his name prominently. Same is the case with the opposing camp. Independent candidate for the post of VP Jignesh Rao and Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad''s (ABVP) GS candidate Vikas Dubey also have their names prominently displayed on several stickers in the university. According to Dubey, ""It is the university''s fault that it could not control the menace in the initial stages. Now, everybody is having a field day. Also there is no way to prove who put up the posters.""

16,City’s sports enthusiasts sore over selections schedule,"VADODARA: If the Vadodara district under-19 football team fails miserably in upcoming tournaments, don''t blame the players or the efforts they make in scoring goals and winning matches. Some of the best players of Vadodara could not participate in the selection trials. And that too for no fault of theirs.

The district has at least two players who have been selected for the junior national team. Apart from that, there are at least 10 other players who have represented the state at the national level. And all of them were busy giving exams in their schools when the selection trials were taking place. All they can do now is be mute spectators as the district sports authority refused to change the date of the trials despite representations, allege concerned school authorities.

Rahul Saxena, Priyank Singh, Hardik Mehta, Jaimin Bakshi, Chinmay Talegaonkar, Hemant Aashar, Luis Lobo, Kirtan Mankad, Kinjal Parikh and Prem Kumar are players who have been left behind by the district sports authorities.

And all of them have represented Gujarat state previously.

The players could not participate in the scratch selection trials for under-19 football trials held on September 15 as they had to give their school examinations, allege school authorities. According to them, the district education officer and district sports officer had held a meeting on August 5 at Ambe Vidyalaya and decided that selections will not be conducted during examinations.
