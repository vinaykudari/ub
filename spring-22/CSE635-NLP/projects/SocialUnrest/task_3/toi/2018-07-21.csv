0,Meet called to incorporate changes in policy,"gandhinagar: in a move to come up with a law to enforce the two-child norm in the coming state assembly session starting on july 26, the gujarat government decided here on thursday to change the basic tenets of the 'population policy of gujarat: final draft', at a top-level meeting to be held on monday. senior minister suresh mehta, who holds the temporary charge of health and family welfare department, has called a meeting of top government bureaucrats including chief secretary g subba rao to bring the draft in line with the idea of two-child norm. elaborating, a senior minister requesting anonymity, said, ""the state's services for subsidised health care, primary education, ration at fair price shops etc. are limited. those who cannot bear the responsibility of adopting the two-child norm would not be provided the services for the third child. for instance, the third child would not be able to avail of free primary education. or, the parents with more than two children would not be allowed to fight panchayat polls."" meanwhile, the central government has told the gujarat government to first implement the central prenatal diagnostic techniques act, banning female feoticide before introducing any kind of population control norms. ""the matter came up at a discussion of ministry of health and family welfare officials with our bureaucrats,"" the source said. ""the central population policy does not speak of incentives or disincentives for population control. but we will not follow that, as the matter comes under state purview.""

1,Trinamool rally to be a show of strength,"kolkata: for the trinamul congress, this year the annual martyr's day rally on july 21 is going to be more of a show of strength against rebel trinamul congress leader ajit panja than against traditional rival the left front. while mamata banerjee's trinamul youth congress (tyc) is rigging up a huge podium at esplanade, panja has taken his show to ghorir more, chinsura, a few kilometres away from the city. and both sides are keen to prove their points. tyc leaders point out that they are going ahead with the rally even though the police have not given them permission. ""we have the cmc permission,"" said aloke das, one of the organisers. das said that the party had written to the police in january this year, asking for permission. ""we received a letter from the police, denying permission. this is very unusual. but we are going ahead with the rally. let them impose a fine on us,"" das said. he also said that the ground beside sahid minar would have been ideal to stage a martyr's day. ""it is full of mud and slush,"" he said. people have already started pouring in for mamata's show from friday. according to trinamul youth congress president sanjay bakshi, 25,000 are expected to descend on the city from north bengal by friday evening. ""we are trying to accommodate these people in different dharamshalas and guest houses,"" bakshi told toins. according to the trinamul youth leader, the total attendence at the esplanade will cross the magic figure of 100,000. trinamul youth leaders feel that panja will lose much of his steam after seeing the crowd on saturday. by organising a separate rally, panja has challenged mamata's position as the party's numero uno and the trinamul youth congress has pulled out all stops to reestablish her position. this year, however, the mamata faction has several handicaps. after trinamul's electoral debacle, the wave in favour of didi is rather weak. moreover, with the elections over and the left front firmly entrenched in writers' buildings, trinamul's appeal as the trojan horse to oust the left is also blunted. moreover, the party being out of power, there are not too many sponsors to bankroll the rally. this is evident in the fewer buses and trucks that are going to ferry in people from the districts. tyc leaders point out that they have not been able to organise the vehicles as they did in the last few years. ""in a sense, this is going to be trinamul congress' real test of organisational strength,"" says a trinamul leader, busy giving the final instructions at the venue. ""but the crowd this year will be unprecedented,"" says mamata loyalist madan mitra. the panja faction is not sitting idle. ateam of 13 young men, carrying torches to commemorate the martyrs, assembled at the gandhi statue this morning. they were flagged off by ajit panja, who will receive the torches at chinsura on saturday. the venue for panja's rally can hold 5000 people at the most and his boys are confident that nothing less than 20000 will attend. the chinsura livewire is panja's trusted lieutenant tapan dasgupta who is going all out to establish that in chinsura it is he, and not mamata loyalist and mp akbar ali khondekar, who calls the shots.

2,Govt trashes last year's population policy draft,"gandhinagar: the gujarat government's final decision to come up with a bill on population control in the forthcoming state assembly session starting on july 26 sharply contradicts the 'population policy of gujarat: final draft' prepared by a high-level committee set up by chief minister keshubhai patel in february 2000. headed by the then health and family welfare minister ashok bhatt, the committee's draft policy spoke sharply against the very concept of population control and rejected the focus on highly centralised target-oriented approach, even incentives, to stop the sharp population rise. favouring a paradigm shift in favour of stabilising population, instead of control, the state's draft policy takes its cue from the national population policy of 2000, which talks of ""providing integrated health care services ... and upgrading health infrastructure"" with specific measures like ""raising the age of marriage of girls, providing health insurance, generating economic opportunities for women, raising literacy levels."" in fact, the state's draft policy praises the national policy for adopting a ""target-free approach as an alternative strategy."" the draft policy remains in hibernation ever since bhatt resigned last year, though consensus was obtained from mlas on march 14, 2000. the experts' working group formed on march 22, 2000 from various field comprising health, education, development, service, management and panchayati raj had also agreed with the draft policy. subsequently, a state-level consultative workshop was held on may 1, 2000 with unfpa support. the plan for a gujarat population commission, under the cm's chairmanship to implement it, has also been forgotten. sharply criticising the past focus on ""targets and incentives"" to stabilise population, the draft policy takes its cue from the 1994 cairo conference on population and development attended by 179 countries, including india, saying, ""(it) helped in developing a holistic and integrated approach to reproductive and child health, and to stabilise population ... with a shift in focus to include stress on greater community involvement, removal of contraceptive targets, introduction of decentralised planning, improving quality of care, gender sensitivity in programme formulation."" though a population policy statement was released on may 11, 2000, for some strange reason, the final draft population policy was never put out officially despite clear directions by the ministry of health and family welfare, government of india, to come up with a state-specific policy on line with the national policy. the ""final draft"" just says the government of gujarat is in the ""process of formulating a population policy,"" with four main objectives in view: * strengthen health care infrastructure as a means to reduce the total fertility rate from 3.0 to replacement level of 2.1 by 2010. * increase contraception prevalence from 57 per cent to 70 per cent. * reduce infant mortality rate from 64 to 30 per 1,000 births. * reduce maternal mortality from 389 to 100 per lakh live births. particularly ""realising that detriments to many reproductive and other health problems are due to gender imbalances in society"", the draft policy wants to enforce ""laws against sex determination vigorously"", improve ""nutritional standards of females through the life cycle approach and universalising primary education for girls that helps improve their self-esteem"", stress on men sharing ""responsibility of contraception"", and incorporate ""family life education in school curriculum.""

12,Doubts over sincerity of SGPC decision,"amritsar: the decision of shiromani gurdwara parbandhak committee (sgpc) allowing jatha bhindran to hold ``path bodh'' (comprehensive recitation of gurbani) at takht damdama sahib, talwandi sabo, which led to the resignation of head granthi of the takht, giani maan singh, who quit alleging gross violation of ``maryada'' (code of conduct) by the preachers, has raised doubts over the sincerity of the decision-making authorities of sgpc. the decision has also led to several questions being raised: were the authorities not aware that the maryada of jatha bhindran, damdami taksal (dt) differs from that of sgpc or was the decision was taken under some influence. the sgpc, in an order, on may 28, had allowed dt to hold the ``path bodh''. even the executive body of sgpc had resolved not to allow anyone to recite gurbani in a distorted form and only to follow the ``maryada'' in this respect. maan singh, who was earlier transferred from takht damdama sahib to gurdwara baba gandha singh, barnala when he pointed out the alleged violation of ``maryada'' by dt preachers and the misleading of the devotees over the correct method of recitation of gurbani, resigned on june 20. a senior sgpc official, on condition of anonymity, told toins, on thursday, that dt ``maryada'' was different from that of akal takht approved ``maryada'' on the recitation of gurbani. yet, he was unable to explain as to why dt was allowed to hold the ``path bodh''. he alleged an active role of an sgpc member in getting the permission to dt. jaswinder singh, coordinator of akal purakh ki fauj and an sgpc member, while hailing the decision of maan singh, said his organisation had all respect for the religious sentiments of the head granthi and would like to honour him in near future. in a letter to sgpc president, jathedar jagdev singh talwandi, singh questioned the issue of granting permission to a taksal for holding the ``path bodh'' when sgpc itself was capable to organise the function. he said such attempts could give rise to new traditions which may confuse sikhism followers. former jathedar of akal takht, bhai ranjit singh alleged that the violation of ``maryada'' was done in the presence of giani kewal singh, jathedar of takht damdama sahib, but he remained quiet which led to suspicion regarding his involvement . sources alleged that giani kewal singh was favouring dt for his vested interests and remained silent on the violation of ``maryada''. deputy chief of akhand kirtani jatha international, bhai baldev singh, while describing the resignation of mann singh, unfortunate, opined that it was time for sgpc to invite other organisations with different ``maryada'', and contemplate reaching a final decision, to dispel any confusion among the sikhs residing world over. giani mohan singh, head granthi of akal takht also echoed baldev singh's sentiments and preferred an early solution to the confusion. one of chief sewadars of dt, bhai didar singh told toins over telephone that the allegations levelled by mann singh were his personal opinion. he claimed that they had full support from sgpc, adding that their form of recitation of gurbani was the correct one. even within the taksal, which is divided into two, one headed by baba thakur singh at chowk mehta and other, headed by baba makhan singh at sato di gali, amritsar, differences persist in ``maryada''.

13,No power tariff hike for farm sector now,"bangalore: chief minister s.m. krishna on saturday hinted that the state would have to postpone power tariff hike in the agricultural sector by another year due to the prevailing drought-like conditions in more than two-thirds of the state. speaking after the signing of a power purchase agreement (ppa) between ntpc and kptc, where the latter will buy 500 mw from ramagundam project stage iii, krishna said: ``implementing power reforms is not easy. our agriculture calculations went haywire last year and we had to subsidise the farming sector by postponing the hike. this year, already much of the state is going through a bad phase and we have asked for central relief to the tune of rs 738 crore. hence, the path to reform is filled with potholes.'' accepting the necessity of reforms, krishna was, however, critical of the word being bandied about. ``reform sounds rather fashionable. but the reality of implementing reforms are the insurmountable problems in the process. we have assured consumers that reforms are taking us to the desirable destination. but looking at the path that we have taken, it does not seem so easy,'' he pointed out. krishna, however, stated that the issue required a pragmatic outlook. ``the country has to pursue reforms regardless of the consequences. we have to orient consumers about the good of reforms and send a loud, clear, transparent message,'' he stated. the cm said the state was moving in this direction and among the measures taken was the proposed amendment imposing stiff penalties for theft to make it a deterrent. ``officials belonging to the sector will also face jail sentences if they are found colluding with vested interests to steal power. this is the need of the hour,'' he added.

16,New excise policy to facilitate sale of foreign liquor,"new delhi: the city government ould soon formulate a policy to facilitate sale of imported foreign liquor in delhi. the excise department would be determining the price structure for the ifl before putting it on shelves in the government-run liquor vends. at present, only five-star hotels are allowed to serve imported liquor once they pay excise duty to the state government. however, there is no uniform price structure for ifl and the hotels are free to serve it at any price. according to excise minister mahinder singh saathi, the excise department would soon start working on the new policy for the sale of ifl. he said the government had planned to sell ifl from the proposed private liquor vends, but the proposal was delayed when the privatisation scheme was deferred three-months back. however, the government is now planning to bring back the new ex cise policy which advocates semi- privatisation of liquor distribution in the city. besides the 240 govern ment-owned liquor shops which are managed by the state-run corpora tions, the new excise policy proposes to have 45 private liquor vends. these vends will sell both foreign and indian-made liquor at prices de termined by the government. when ready, the government will notify the new policy permitting five private liquor shops to operate in each of the nine city districts. saathi said changes have been made to the current excise policy to make the liquor business more com petitive. recently, the government slashed the prices of popular brands of medium range liquor. prices of all brands sold in the government outlets which ranged from rs 91 to rs 200 were lowered by 10 per cent. how ever, prices of upper range and lower range remained the same. saathi said the idea behind this de cision is to check smuggling of liquor from the neighbouring states. ``now our prices are same as in the neigh bouring haryana and uttar pradesh. medium range liquor is consumed widely. our uniform pricing would deter bootleggers from smuggling li quor into delhi,'' he added. the government has done away with fixed ordering pattern with ef fect from july this year. the 10 per cent reduction in the maximum retail prices of medium range liquor also means 10 per cent reduction in the excise duty paid by these brand man ufacturers to the government. excise minister said the govern ment has already bridged the gap in revenue by pushing up the brand fee for upper range liquor brands. early this year, the government had raised the brand fee for high priced liquor from rs 50,000 per annum to rs 2 lakh per annum. saathi conceded there had been widespread resentment among the li quor manufacturers on reduction in liquor prices. ``some manufacturers have been unhappy about our deci sion. but the new prices are at par with other states. in fact, in the past, our government had been allowing these manufacturers to sell at a high er price which resulted in large scale smuggling. in turn, it meant huge revenue loss to us,'' he asserted. he said the government will en sure that all brands are put on the shelves and no particular brand is fa voured above another.
