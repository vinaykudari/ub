0,Police to arrest organisers of Ambernath training camp,"THANE: The police has said that it will arrest the organisers of an Ambernath camp at which youth reportedly are being trained to form suicide squads on the lines of those proposed by Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray. The organisers of the Maharashtra Military Foundation camp will be held under the Arms Act for using prohibited pistols, said additional superintendent of police, Thane (Rural), S J More.

The so-called commando training camp started from November 1 in Vasad village, seven kms away from Ambernath, in Thane district. The foundation has for the past two years been conducting such camps in Pune, aimed at helping youngsters prepare to join the army. The 15-day camp costs each candidate Rs 1,500.

The foundation is run by retired Col. Jayantrao Chitale. Of late, he has roped in Lt Gen (retd) P.N. Hoon to serve as the chief guest at camp graduation ceremonies. Lt Gen Hoon previously had been feted by Bal Thackeray at one of the Shiv Senaâ€™s Dasara rallies.

Thirty youngsters enrolled for the first batch of the camp. They were given certificates saying that they had completed commando training to be a part of of a suicide squad and that they would lay down their lives for the country. Training for a second batch was to start from November 16; 30 youths already have signed up.

Col. Chitale said the training camp was open to all castes and communities and the suicide squads were being formed to give a â€œfitting answerâ€™â€™ to terrorists. â€œWe are not connected to any political organisation and the commando-training programme is an ongoing project,â€™â€™ he said.

The Shiv Sena has already distanced itself from the foundation, saying that the party had nothing to do with the training camp. In fact, observers say that the suicide squads were just a publicity gimmick by the foundation.

Chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh announced on Thursday that he ordered an inquiry into the camps. Meanwhile, the Mumbai police said it was not taking any cognisance of the training camps run by the VHP to train women to use firearms.

1,UP govt takes up VRS onus of Uptron workers,"LUCKNOW: The Uttar Pradesh government has finally agreed to take up the financial burden to be incurred on offering VRS (voluntary retirement scheme) to employees of Uptron. With no chances of survival on the horizon, the government has taken this decision to facilitate the closure of Uptron. The company has accumulated a whopping Rs 423.77 crore of outstanding against an asset of Rs 44 crore. Loans taken from SBI are also included in it. The financial mess in the company forced the government to shy away from any revival measures for Uptron, said an official.After having paid salary dues of Rs 6.98 crore in 1991 to Uptron staff, the government stated that it was not it's job to pay these salaries and filed a PIL in the Supreme Court seeking an exemption from this responsibility. This dealt a severe blow to the company, from which it never recovered, said an official. As of now, out of 2065 employees, 670 employees have availed VRS. There is another lot of 543 employees waiting to accept the offer, while 243 have been absorbed in other units. Besides, 579 employees have already gone to other departments, said the official.After having failed to come up with an acceptable 'revival package' for the company, the government said it would give a salary amounting to Rs 23 crore to employees who opt for VRS. The government has stated that it would also pay Rs 49 crore for clearing salary dues of employees.Apart from these dues, the State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, Bank of Baroda, State Bank of Patiala and Allahabad Bank own as much as Rs 343.83 crore against the company. The managing director of Uptron said these banks had offered a cash credit limit to the company for transaction of its business.Now these banks, said the official, have an outstanding of Rs 70.73 crore on term loan. Then Uptron also took a term loan of Rs 9 crore from IFCI, State Bank of Patiala and SBI. Now in lieu of these loans, the company will be required to cough up Rs 79.5 crore. Of this amount, Rs 70.5 crore is the interest incurred on loans taken from the banks, said the official. Umpteen number of packages were prepared for the revival of the company, but they could not work, said a company secretary, Avinash Chandra. The first package of Rs 60 crore, prepared by IFCI, was put forward in 1995 and the second in 1997. This package sought an investment of Rs 104.54 crore. Then the third package prepared by DK Associates sought an investment of Rs 171.04 crore.Surprisingly, these packages were not approved by the government. On January 12, 1999, the government communicated its disapproval about these packages to the BIFR. Then another attempt was made in 1999 to prepare an agreeable package of Rs 100.33 crore, but this also failed to lift the spirits of the company. Eminent economist AK Singh said the company could have made a profit, if the planners had taken care of problems in right earnest. It is strange that at a time when the TV market is going up, Uptron failed, he said.The idea of spending Rs 1000 crore on VRS is not bright, Singh said. He added that if the government was willing to spend this amount, then Uptron could well be revived. The biggest mistake on the part of the company was that it failed to diversify itself, stated the economist. He remarked that it was not too late to revive it. In the past, only half-hearted revival attempts were made and if determined efforts were made even today, Uptron could be revived, he said.

2,CM wants report on ‘suicide squad’ camp,"MUMBAI/THANE: The state government has asked the police to investigate into media reports about a training camp for â€œsuicide squadsâ€� in Thane and submit a report in the next few days, according to chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh.

â€œSince many versions about the suicide camp were received, we have asked for a thorough investigation into it by the police and intelligence,â€� he said. He was talking to reporters on the sidelines of a Confederation of Indian Industryâ€™s seminar on Biotechnology in Mumbai on Thursday.

3,‘Suicide squad’ camp organisers face arrest,"THANE: The Thane (rural) police has taken serious note of reports in the media about youths being trained at an Ambarnath camp for a â€œsuicide squadâ€� on the lines of those proposed by Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray.

The police says it will arrest the organisers of the Maharashtra Military Foundation (MMF) for the use of pistols in its training camp. â€œWe will register a case against the campâ€™s organisers under the Arms Act for carrying prohibited arms,â€� additional superintendent of police, Thane (Rural), S.J. More, told TNN on Thursday.

The â€œcommando training campâ€� is being held by the MMF at Vasad village, seven km away from Ambarnath in Thane district from November 1. The MMF, run by Col. (retd.) Jayantrao Chitale, has been conducting such camps for the past two years in Pune. Each candidate has to pay Rs 1,500 for the 15-day camp meant for army aspirants.

Thirty youngsters were enrolled for the first batch of the training camp at Ambarnath. They were given certificates which said that they had completed commando training to be a part of a suicide squad and that they would lay down their lives for the country. Training for a second batch was to start from November 16.

Col. Chitale said the training camp was open to all castes and communities and the suicide squads were being formed to give a â€œfitting answerâ€� to terrorists. â€œWe are not connected to any political organisation and the commando training programme is an on going project of the MMF,â€� he said.

The Shiv Sena has already distanced itself from the MMF, saying that the party had nothing to do with the training camp. In fact, observers say the suicide squads were just a publicity gimmick on the part of the MMF.

The Sena chief in his Dassera rallyin Mumbai in October had urged Hindu youngsters to form suicide squads on the lines of those of the Lashkar-e-Toiba to counter militant attacks. Col. Chitale has also claimed that a large number of youngsters are keen to join his camps.

4,Guha opposes govt's border exercises,"KOLKATA: State agriculture minister Kamal Guha has opposed CM Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee''s move to enlist villagers staying or cultivating beyond the fences at the India-Bangladesh border.

The state government took up the exercise after the Union home ministry suggested relocation of the border population, ostensibly to check infiltration and movement of ultras. Guha, who is also the Forward Bloc chairman, made it clear that his party would oppose the move and demanded that Bhattacharjee discuss the issue at the Left Front committee and the state Cabinet.

""The district magistrate of Jalpaiguri has gone to survey the border population outside the fence on Thursday. I told my people there to foil his move,"" the minister said at the Writers'' Buildings.

""The CM had assured me the villagers would not be evicted but his officials sent different instructions to the district administration. I hope that the Front and the Cabinet would discuss the issue immediately and reject the Centre''s move,"" Guha said.

According to him, many villagers have not received compensation for the land acquired by the government for construction of border roads and erecting iron fences. His party has geared up to make it a major issue in the ensuing panchayat election. The Left Front partner will also hold a rally on February 24 in Delhi.

5,No funds for new govt colleges: CM,"KOLKATA: With a hole in its pocket, it will no longer be possible for the state government to set up any more colleges, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee bluntly told a gathering of teachers on Thursday.

""We have set up 44 engineering and technical colleges in the state. Three new medical colleges are also coming up. But that is all. It will not be possible for us to set up any more such institutions because of our financial crisis,"" the chief minister told the gathering organised by the All Bengal Teachers'' Association.

Bhattacharjee made it clear that his government was now looking up to private investors for setting up institutions of higher learning in the. ""If private investors want to set up medical and engineering colleges, they are welcome. Our government will provide full cooperation,"" he assured.

Minutes before the chief minister spoke, ABTA general-secretary Amal Banerjee had ripped apart the Centre and ""international imperialism"" for their conspiracy in handing over education to the corporate sector and turning it into a profit making venture.

The chief minister, however, turned the heat on teachers holding a section of them responsible for the poor standard of school education.

""Why do we have to hear that students are not being taught anything in government schools and that the English medium schools and those affiliated to the Central boards are much better? This is because some of our teachers are truly inept.""

Bhattacharjee also admitted that despite his government''s desperate efforts, a section of school teachers were still giving private tuition and were blatantly bunking classes. He appealed to the ABTA leadership to identify the errant teachers and take steps to stop the practice.

Bhattacharjee admitted that funds crunch was behind the lack of infrastructure in a large number of schools. Still, he insisted that his government was committed to setting up three centres of excellence, start vocational training in every school and implement the midday meal scheme to check the dropout rate.

Speaking earlier, school education minister Kanti Biswas, however, rolled out statistics to prove that the standard of education and the financial conditions of the teachers in the state was one of the best in the world. Left Front chairman Biman Bose wondered whether it would be possible for the government to improve school infrastructure immediately because of the financial crisis.

7,Mumbai blast accused arrested in Porbandar,"RAJKOT: The Porbander police on Wednesday night nabbed Babumiya Panjumiya, one of the most wanted man in the Mumbai serial blasts case of 1993, from the Memonwad area of Porbander town.

According to the Porbander police, Babumiya was wanted for the landing of RDX and deadly arms on the Gosabari coast nine years ago, and was absconding all these years. Investigations have been reopened in the entire case once again, police said. The RDX was later smuggled to Mumbai where it was used in the serial blasts to avenge the demolition of the Babri Masjid. The Porbander SP Rajkuar Pandiyan had ordered a watch after he was tipped off about the movement of Babumiya in Porbander in recent days, though he has spent most of the last nine years in Maharashtra.

The accused was to arrive at the residence of his brother Gaffarmiya to offer his condolence on the death of his nephew.

Police, in civilian dress, keeping a watch on Memonwad area nabbed him after a surprise raid on the house of his brother.

Police said Babumiya was instrumental in the landing of RDX used in the Mumbai blasts and also that of lethal arms at Gosbari in early 1993 using a small country craft. Deadly RDX, a pistol and some AK-47s were brought in by the gang which included Babumiya, Dadlimiya and Mamumiya. The trio had also smuggled in a lot of silver and had fled on seeing the police. It was also revealed that while Dadlimiya and Mamumiya had fled to Dubai, Babumiya was in India and had confined himself to Mumbai and Ajmer and was said to be working as a truck driver.

8,Independents don’t stand much of a chance in Gujarat polls,"AHMEDABAD: Gujarat has never been a happy hunting ground for independent candidates in assembly elections. But there was a small minority of such candidates who carved out small pockets for themselves in the battle of the lotus vs palm. Some of these non-aligned fighters even made BJP and Congress candidates taste bitter defeats.

Not any more. The December 12 elections are unlikely to throw up many â€œindependent voicesâ€� as the only three independent candidates elected in 1998 have decided to align with either of the Big Two of the state.

They seem to have realised that politics in Gujarat is a two-way lane. Trying to create your on path may lead to a dead-end. Among the three elected in 1998, Junagadh MLA Mahendra Mashru has already joined the BJP, while former Gujarati film star and deputy speaker of the dissolved assembly Upendra Trivedi is likely to join the saffron brigade and fight for the Bhiloda seat soon. Usman Gani Devdiwala, the only other independent who has retained his Jamalpur seat in Ahmedabad in three elections, is most likely to fight on a Congress ticket this year. â€œIn a state where almost all the votes are polarised between only two parties, it is very difficult to survive as an independent,â€� Devdiwala admits. â€œYou need over 30 per cent of the electorate behind you to win, unlike in states like Uttar Pradesh where the votes are divided between four or five large parties and you win on a smaller margin.â€�

Even in times when the independents have done well in the state, they have found it difficult to resist the temptation of joining a party and having the weight of an organisation behind them. In 1995 for instance, the independents constituted the second largest opposition group with 16 seats. Devdiwala had been appointed as their leader. But before they could develop any real bargaining power, 75 per cent joined the Congress while the rest joined the BJP.

This was immediately reflected in the 1998 elections where the number of independent contestants fell from more than 1,600 to 415 and only three were elected. â€œKeshubhai had personally asked me to join the BJP when he was chief minister and I could not resist it,â€� says Mashru. â€œContesting as an independent has never been a problem for me as even the deposit has been paid by friends. But you can get more done for your constituency with the support a party like the BJP.â€�

Mashru has gravitated towards the ruling party despite having made both the Congress and the BJP bite dust in the earlier contests. He was so popular in 1995 that all his 30 opponents lost their deposits!

For all his saffron rhetoric Mashru canâ€™t hide the fact that it no longer makes sense to remain the lone ranger in Gujarat. His compatriots in other states somehow still see light at the end of the tunnel. Uttar Pradesh for instance had nothing less than 5,533 candidates for the 402 seats in the recently concluded assembly election. Of these 2,352 were independents and 15 made it to the House. In 1996, 13 were elected among the 2,031 that contested.

Devdiwala however does expect some surprises. â€œThere are many tickets aspirants both in the BJP and the Congress,â€� he says. â€œObviously, not everyone will get a ticket, and many of the disgruntled elements may choose to go independent.â€�

9,Gujarat govt refuses permission for yatra,"GANDHINAGAR: On a day which began with VHP strongman Pravin Togadia flashing a copy of the permission granted by the Godhra administration for its yatra which has been disallowed, it was the dilemma of the stateâ€™s bureaucracy, caught between pressures from the political leadership and the Election Commission, which lay exposed.

The Godhra SDMâ€™s order, supposedly issued on Wednesday evening granting permission to the VHP to hold a rally to launch its controversial Hindu Pat Padshahi Yatra, was revoked by the district collector following orders from Gandhinagar.

Quite mysteriously, while the additional chief secretary for home, Ashok Narayan, was telling the media on Wednesday that the organisers had not yet approached the administration seeking permission for the yatra, it now appears that the application for permission was filed in Godhra on Tuesday itself and the permission was granted on Wednesday evening even as the EC in New Delhi told the government to clamp down on the proposed yatra.

Throughout Thursday, bureaucrats in the Sachivalay were seen scurrying in and out of the Chief Ministerâ€™s Office seeking directions on how to wriggle out of the situation before finally telling the Godhra collector to issue a fresh order cancelling the permission granted earlier. Not that it made much of an impact with the VHP which expressed its determination to launch the yatra on November 17 from Godhra and mounted a vicious attack on Chief Election Commissioner J M Lyngdoh.

An order issued by Godhra district collector Manoj Agrawal late on Thursday said, â€œWe have finally decided not to allow the VHP to go ahead with the yatra. We decided this as the EC said nothing should be done that would arouse communal passions. My order is based on the direction of chief secretary G Subba Rao along with the EC order to implement it.â€�

Officials in Gandhinagar had a hard time explaining how the SDM could have granted permission to the yatra without consulting the higher-ups knowing well that the Election Commission had sought a report on the yatra from the state government. There is speculation here that the SDM could not have acted independently and had perhaps got a cue from the top to grant the permission despite the state governmentâ€™s repeated commitment that it would abide by the ECâ€™s directives. Torn between the EC order and toeing the line of the political leadership, Gujaratâ€™s top administration appeared reluctant to decide on how to react to the situation. Subba Rao and Narayan had lengthy meetings with Chief Minister Narendra Modi before finally telling the Godhra collector to act. The two top bureaucrats put up a bold face before the reporters suggesting they cared little for any political pressure, whether it be the BJP or the Congress. Asked whether the CM agreed with the report on the yatra he had sent to the EC, Narayan told TNN, â€œYou can ask the CM. But let me tell you, I didnâ€™t reveal its contents to him before sending it across.â€�

At Godhra, collector Agrawal and other officers sat till late in the evening but failed to receive any clear-cut direction on what to do on the crucial issue. With the top state officialdom sending the EC order with the advice that â€œappropriate actionâ€� be taken, the district officials were hoping that Gandhinagar would make up its mind soon.

Narayan, however, claimed: â€œWhen the SDM gave the VHP permission on Wednesday, the EC order had still not come. When the EC order came, we did not know anything about the SDM having given the permission.â€�

10,HC seeks report on state govt companies,"PATNA: The Patna High Court on Thursday directed the registrar, Company Law Board, Bihar, to report within four weeks about the functioning and conditions of all the state government companies that have been registered under the Companies Act. A division bench, comprising Chief Justice R S Dhavan and Justice R N Prasad, made serious observation on the reported fact that the government companies that are registered under the Companies Act have not filed their audit report and ""no balance report"" for the last several years.

Proof sought: A single bench of HC presided over by Justice R S Garg on Wednesday asked the Bettiah-based NGO, Rural Education and Development (READ), to give proof to the financial director, Bihar State Electricity Board, regarding its claim of being a domestic electricity consumer. READ''s lawyer K M Joseph argued that READ had been engaged in providing informal education and other social development works. The BSEB had registered READ as a domestic consumer, but recently the former sent it a commercial consumer bill. He said that READ was engaged in producing paddy in 10 acres of land in Bettiah and the proceeds of the crop goes to imparting informal education to the needy and poor.

The power supplied to READ is being used at its hostel and a guest house within. Thus it cannot be designated as a commercial consumer, he added.

11,Kidnapped principal returns after 22 days,"SAMASTIPUR: Police heaved a sigh of relief as the principal of Sant Kabir College, Samastipur, Ramchandra Rai, who was kidnapped from Purnahi village under Warisnagar police station of Samastipur, returned home on Wednesday after spending 22 days in captivity.

Reports said the criminals allegedly received a handsome amount for the release of the principal.

Rai''s wife Bhagwati Devi is mukhiya of Purnahi panchayat.

The officer-in-charge of Warisnagar police station, Sri Prakash Singh, however, claimed that the police arrested half a dozen persons and put relentless pressure on the kidnappers'' gang which resulted in safe release of the principal.

Sources revealed that the principal was kept in Muzaffarpur district which has once again confirmed that the criminals operating in parts of Samastipur are in league with their counterparts in Muzaffarpur district.

The police had arrested two persons from under Piar police station of Muzaffarpur in connection with the principal''s abduction.

12,Waive interest on farm loans: CPM,"HYDERABAD: The CPM has criticised the Centre for its ""callous"" and ""inhuman"" attitude in dealing with the drought-affected states.

Reacting to Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee''s announcement on deferment of collection of farm loans in the drought-hit areas, CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury said the government''s gesture would only put additional burden on the farm sector in future.

""Deferring collection of loans will only mean that the collection process would commence later putting an additional burden on farmers,"" Yechury said at a press conference here on Thursday. He demanded that the government, at least, waive interest on the loans obtained by farmers, if it was not prepared to waive the loans.

Stating that 14 states in the country had been adversely affected by the drought, he said that despite repeated requests, the Centre did not convene a meeting of the taskforce on drought for announcing relief from the National Calamity Fund.

Referring to the Vishwa Hindu Parishad''s yatra in Gujarat despite being restricted by the Election Commission, the CPM leader said the VHP and Bajrang Dal were acting against the interests of the country to fuel communal sentiments in Gujarat.

In case the VHP sticks to its stand and defies the ruling by the EC, the government should act firmly against the organisation.

He, however, clarified that the CPM was not demanding a ban on the VHP.

When asked about CLP leader Y S Rajasekhara Reddy''s letter to political parties on the free power issue, he said the CPM would comment on the issue only after studying the contents of the letter.

13,Enhance farm output: Vadde,"HYDERABAD: Agriculture minister Vadde Sobhanadreeswara Rao has called upon the agriculture department to take technological advances in the field to the doorsteps of farmers to enhance food productivity.

Releasing the district-wise land resources atlas at the State Agricultural Management and Extension Training Institute (Sameti) on Thursday, Rao said the use of the atlas of land resources at the district level would help farmers plan their crops and investment on inputs for productivity.

The atlas was developed by the National Bureau of Soil Survey and Land Use Planning (NBSS&LUP), Nagpur.

Rao said productivity levels in the state were less compared to others, because of the high cost of cultivation, poor soil, frequent natural calamities, and other geographical factors.

The land resource maps should come in handy for farmers to enable them to achieve high productivity, he said.

V P Jauhari, principal secretary, agriculture, said that out of the available land in the country, only 50 per cent was cultivable. There were numerous problems including soil erosion and water logging in the cultivable land, reducing the productivity of the farmers, he said.

14,Clean chit to law officer in acid attack case,"BATHINDA: An inquiry by the Bathinda police into the alleged involvement of a judicial officer (now posted at Chandigarh) in the crime of blinding one Chhotu Ram, a resident of Goneana town of Bathinda district, by throwing acid at him, has exonerated the judge and his family members of the charges levelled by the victim''s family.

Harbhajan Singh, superintendent of police (headquarter) Bathinda, the inquiry officer, has given the judge Sandeep Singla and his father Madan Lal a clean chit after a thorough probe into the incident which occurred about 10 years back.

The judge had been cleared of charges as the victim''s family failed to provide any substantial evidence to prove their case, said the inquiry report.

The Bathinda police had started an inquiry into the case after Lawyers for Human Rights International (LHRI), a voluntary organisation, produced the victim Chottu Ram and his family members before media persons here, on July 18 this year.

The victim''s family had alleged that Chhotu Ram was given ''''acid punishment'''' for he had dared to contest municipal election against the father of the accused. The LHRI had conducted an inquiry into the incident, indicting the judicial magistrate and his father.

The ''crime'' was exposed by the victim''s family after about ten years of its happening during the press conference. All members of the aggrieved family, including Chhotu Ram (now blind in both eyes due to acid attack), his wife, two daughters and a teenaged son were present during the press conference.

The reason given by the family for revealing the incident after a full ten years was that at the time of acid attack while the victim was on the verge of death, the wife was busy moving between hospitals and looking after children and therefore unable to fight for justice.

After the incident was highlighted in the media and the police started a probe, the victim''s family had accused the judge and his family of exerting pressure to drop the case but an inquiry by the SP(H) claimed that the victim''s family failed to prove the allegations.

Harbhajan Singh declined to divulge the details of the inquiry report. When contacted Balwant Singh Dhillon, the senior vice-president of LHRI, said that another inquiry in the case was pending with the vigilance judge of the Punjab and Haryana high court.

15,HC stays govt order fixing price of sugarcane,"ALLAHABAD: The Allahabad High Court stayed the operation of a government order (GO), dated November 12, fixing sugarcane price. It also directed the state to desist from fixing prices in future.

The West UP Sugar Mills Association (WUPSMA) and 38 sugar mills filed a writ petition for restraining the state from announcing sugarcane price which was to be paid by factories of UP Sugar Corporation and UP Cooperative Factories Federation.

It also prayed for quashing of the GO and restraining the government from taking any coercive measure against petitioners.

A division bench, comprising Justices M Katju and Rakesh Tiwari stayed the GO and noted the persistence of the state in flagrantly flouting the judgement of the court passed on December 11, 1996, as well as order of the Supreme Court on January 22, 1997.

On December 11, 1996, the division bench of the High Court had held in the case of WUPSMA and others that the ""state advised cane price is illegal for two reasons (I) the minimum cane price can only be fixed by the Central government as is evident from clause (III) of the UP Sugarcane Control Order, 1966 and not by any other authority and (II) there is no statutory provision permitting the state government to fix the state advised cane price.""

Counsel for petitioners Sudhir Chandra had submitted that payment of a higher price by the factories of the corporation and cooperatives had affected private sugar mills since they were only paying the statutory minimum price fixed by the Central government.

""This anomaly is creating resentment amongst farmers and is also posing a serious law and order problem, he added.

16,"Needed, political will for mid-day meal","LUCKNOW: The members of Musahar community in UP often consume mice to stay alive. Similarly, people like Om Prakash, a snake charmer from Allahabad, though he hasn''t resorted to consuming his snakes yet, is struggling to make ends meet due to wandering nature of his tribe.

Mohani and Phulwasi from Kodhar Ghat, Tehsil Meja, are impoverished labourers. The names and stories are endless but the common ground that link their tales of woe is their starving children.

India is among the countries with highest undernutrition level. Half of all children are estimated to be undernourished and one third of all babies are born with a low ''birth weight.''

On Thursday - the Children''s Day - children and parents from 24 districts of the state congregated in front of the Vidhan Bhawan under the banner of ''Mid-Day Meal Campaign'' (MDMC) to protest against the non-implementation of the Supreme Court''s November 28 ruling directing all state governments to provide cooked meals to all primary schools children within six months.

According to an estimate, a well-planned mid-day meal would cost about Re 1 per child per day which will amount to a burden of Rs 640 crore per year for the UP government. And the government feels that''s too much. Currently, it provides 3 kg of grain per month to children attending primary schools.

Jean Dreze, eminent economist and social activist says ""Enrolment went up by 35 per cent in Rajasthan when mid-day meals were introduced. Yet the issue of providing mid-day meals has been drowned by cacophonous polemics of political gains. The government is so alienated from ground realities and its priorities so displaced that it doesn''t seem to comprehend that the future of 20 million children are at stake.""

Dreze claimed that even the estimate of Rs 640 crore was inaccurate as it was based on official enrolment figures which tended to be over-inflated. A more realistic assessment would trim this cost down to Rs 400 crore. However, for successful implementation there needs to be a political will.

Adiyog, co-ordinator of the MDMC, explained that the benefits accrued from this scheme were threefold. It is a strong enrolment incentive for poor students. Secondly, it protected children from hunger. A lot of students were unable to return to the school after they went home for lunch. Finally, sitting together and sharing meals helped break caste prejudices and gender barriers, he said.

17,Chidambaram defends UF govt decision,"NEW DELHI: P Chidambaram, finance minister in the United Front government (1996-97), on Thursday defended the then government''s decision to distance itself from institutions such as the Unit Trust of India (UTI) and letting them be managed by professional directors without interference in their commercial decisions.

Appearing before the joint parliamentary committee probing the 2001 post-budget stock scam and the UTI trouble, he said it was felt that banking activities should be taken away from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and entrusted to a separate independent agency.

Briefing reporters about the committee''s interaction with Chidambaram, JPC chairman Prakash Mani Tripathi said Chidambaram conceded that there were some regulatory deficiencies during his tenure, but defended them saying that the economy was in a transitional phase from a controlled economy to a market economy.

He said the government had nothing to do with the UTI''s decisions to declare higher dividend than the income by drawing down the reserves.

18,India aiming to increase self-sufficiency in crude oil,"NEW DELHI: India is aiming to up its self- sufficiency in crude oil from 30 per cent to 50 per cent in next the five years by tapping unexplored sedimentary basins and acquisition of oil equity abroad, Petroleum Minister Ram Naik said on Friday.

""Our target is to achieve at least 50 per cent self sufficiency in our energy needs in the next five years and I am confident that with the impetus to the exploration programme and acquisition of equity oil abroad, we would be able to meet these targets,"" he said at a seminar on ''Re-energising Performance'' here.

Indigenous crude production, which accounted for 8 per cent of the demand in 1980s, now caters to 30 per cent of the just over 100 million tonnes domestic demand.

""About 78 million tonnes of crude and petroleum products were imported in 2001-02 at a cost of over Rs 78,000 crore,"" he said, adding the government has awarded 47 blocks in the first two rounds of New Exploration Licensing Policy.

Oil and gas discoveries have already been made in one block on the west coast and two blocks in deep waters on the east coast, he said.

OVL''s acquisition of 20 per cent stake in Sakhalin oil fields in Russia, at a cost of Rs 8,500 crore, would give India 4 to 8 million tonnes of crude oil from 2005 and 25 per cent in Sudan would give 3 million tonnes immediately.

""The spurt in exploration activities had led to discovery of 7 trillion cubic feet of gas in Krishna-Godavari Basin by the consortium of Reliance Industries and Niko Resources of Canada,"" he said.

Earlier, Cairn Energy of UK had discovered gas reserves in Gulf of Cambay and KG Basin, Naik said.

""The country has achieved self-sufficiency in refining with the present refining capacity of 116.5 million tonnes. However, more refining capacity will have to be added over the years to keep pace with the growth and demand,"" he said.

Besides, oil industry would be required to invest Rs 18,000 crore by 2005 and Rs 12,000 crore by 2010 to produce Euro-III quality fuel for the entire country, he said.

Naik said competition in oil market would set in the next 2-3 years when Reliance Industries and Essar Oil, who have been granted authorisation to set up petrol stations, come up with their retail chain.

Speaking on the occasion, Petroleum Secretary B K Chaturvedi said oil companies have to cut refining and marketing cost to become globally competitive.

""Currently, refining margins (at around 3 dollars a barrel) look healthy. But they are far below the international standards,"" he said emphasizing that cost cutting would enhance refining margins.

For upstream oil exploration firms, Chaturvedi said, ""they have to cut down cost of production. (Domestic retail) price of petrol is still high and we want to bring it down.""

20,Gujarat polls won't affect the Centre: Advani,"RANCHI: Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani on Friday said the outcome of coming assembly elections in Gujarat will not have any bearing on the Centre.

""State elections do not have an impact on the Central government,"" he told a press conference here.

Elections in a state were important essentially because every state in the country was spread over a large area and Gujarat was not a small area, Advani said.

""It is a large state. It is an important state and has its own significance,"" he said.

Asked to comment on the VHP''s decision to take out its yatra in Gujarat defying the Election Commission ban, Advani said the state government would take an appropriate decision.

The DPM said since he was in government he would not comment on the matter. ""It is for the VHP to comment and may be for my party to do so. I do not comment on the Election Commission decision being a member of the government.""

Asked if he had talked to the VHP in this connection, Advani said he had neither spoken to any VHP leader nor would like to do so.

21,Centre to cooperate with Mufti govt: Advani,"RANCHI: Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani on Friday said the Centre will extend full cooperation to new Jammu and Kashmir government in combating cross-border terrorism and in development of the state.

""The coalition government of a national party and a regional party has two tasks before it -- to win over cross-border terrorism and take the state on the path to progress. And the Centre will cooperate with the state in both,"" he told a press conference here.

Advani, however, cautioned the government that the people would closely scrutinise every action taken by the coalition government.

The role of the regional party, the People''s Democratic Party, will be judged by local people while that of the other coalition partner, Congress, will come under review at the national level.

Stating the war against terrorism was a national issue, he said a large number of people had laid down their lives to protect borders.

Asked to comment on the release of POTA detenues by the Mufti Mohammed Sayeed government, he said, ""Every state has certain rights under the Constitution. It depended on a state what it would do to ensure success of its strategy.""

22,Unemployment by end of 10th Plan could increase to 9-10 cr,"NEW DELHI: Faced with the prospect of 9 to 10 crore unemployed by the end of the Tenth Plan period, Planning Commission on Friday said India will need to focus on asset generation programmes through labour intensive measures rather than focusing merely on poverty alleviation.

""There should be more emphasis on the asset generation programme than poverty alleviation through labour intensive measures,"" Planning Commission member S P Gupta, who also headed the special report on employment, said here.

Addressing a seminar on employment organised by PHDCCI he said there were about 3 crore unemployed persons in the country and if nothing was done the figure would touch 9-10 crore by the end of the current plan.

He said the Planning Commission was on a employment mission involving both corporate and non-corporate sector to find a solution to the employment problem in the tenth plan period.

Gupta pointed out that the corporate sector had failed to generate employment because of the increasing competition and technological expansion. Hence, despite an increase in capital intensity in the organised sector employment growth was negative.

Any structural changes should be done with a human face, he said adding that the country should develop its own R&D rather than relying on the western technology which is more capital intensive.

Flexibility should be brought in the labour market while carrying heavy labour into the new global order where changes in demand and supply were quick, he said.

24,Sena backs formation of suicide squads: Gen Hoon,"CHANDIGARH: In a bid to clear the ongoing controversy over the formation of suicide squads to counter terrorism in the country, Shiv Sena sampark pramukh for Uttar Hindustan Lt Gen (retd) P N Hoon has said that although Shiv Sena supported the formation of such squads it is not involved with the Maharashtra Military Foundation, which had recently announced that it had trained a batch of commandos.

Gen Hoon, who was the chief guest at the passing out of these commandos, reiterated that he supports the idea floated by Shiv Sena supremo Balasahib Thackeray on Dussehra. Over the years, Pakistan, through its ISI, has created a network of agents and moles in every walk of life in our country.

The security forces cannot penetrate this network. The terrorists can strike at will at our temples, Parliament, highways, markets and everywhere.

In fact, they have succeeded in their goal of terrorising people. The aim of forming suicide squads of dedicated people is to create a fear in the minds of terrorists that there are common people in India who are willing to die for the country.â€�

â€œThe trained commandos will not blow themselves up but they can form a network of intelligence gathering at the basic level and inform the security agencies and if time is short, sacrifice their lives to save the lives of hundreds,â€� Hoon added.

Lauding the spirit of the youth, who had volunteered to become suicide commandos, Gen Hoon said that those who called the formation of such squads as communal were themselves antinational and anti-secularism.

Commenting on the police crackdown on the Maharashtra Military Foundation, Hoon said that it was sad that government was catching those who were true patriots and releasing known criminals and withdrawing cases against them in Jammu and Kashmir under the newly elected government.

On the order of the Shiv Sena chief of the Punjab unit, the party has been dissolved and a 30-member provisional committee has been constituted to run the day-to-day affairs of the party. The committee will work under the chairmanship of Swami Pushpendra Swaroop Ji and will also decide on the names of future office-bearers.

25,20 illegal farmhouses demolished,"NEW DELHI: Over 20 unauthorised farmhouses, some allegedly owned by diplomats, were demolished in Rangpuri near Vasant Kunj by the Airport Authority of India on Friday amid tight security.

The demolition was carried out by the Authority to reclaim its land. The bulldozers worked for over seven hours to break the illegal structures on the land which would be used to rehabilitate Nangal Dewat village.

The Nangal Dewat village, facing the international terminal of the airport, is to be shifted to Rangpuri to make way for an additional runway for the Delhi airport. The runway is needed to handle the increasing air traffic.

Over 20 acre land was cleared of encroachment through a coordinated effort with the revenue department of the Delhi state government.

â€˜â€˜The action on these unauthorised farm houses had been cancelled on six earlier occasions,â€™â€™ said an AAI official, hinting at the influence wielded by the farm house owners.

27,Krishna tells farmers to use credit cards,"BANGALORE: Chief minister S M Krishna wants his farmers to move with the times and be at par with the world fast moving ahead.

And the first step towards this direction, he suggested on Thursday, was switching to the use of credit cards instead of hard cash. He also stressed on medical insurance.

At the inauguration of the 49th All India Cooperatives Week, Krishna urged Karnataka farmers to take a leaf from the Western lifestyle even as thousands of farmers gaped in incomprehension.

â€˜â€˜We should look to the Western countries like the US, England, Germany or even Japan. They do not take notes out of their pockets to buy everyday things like we do. They use credit cards, which gives them a better idea of their monthly expenditure,â€™â€™ he said.

Going on to the topic of insurance, Krishna said: â€˜â€˜Those of us who are rich can afford life insurance. But none of us even go for regular health check-ups. â€˜â€˜In the West, everyone goes for a medical check- up once a year, be it US President George Bush or Englandâ€™s Queen Elizabeth or their Prime Minister Tony Blair, everyone has a health insurance.â€™â€™

Advocating the Yashaswini health insurance scheme, which he earlier launched through a puja â€” complete with bells, flowers, incense and arti â€” Krishna said: â€˜â€˜If anyone of you or your family members suffers from any health problem, you can avail medical help under this scheme. If more people went for the Yashaswini programme, the demands on the chief ministerâ€™s fund for medical expenses, which come from MLAs, MLCs and MPs will come down.â€™â€™

Krishna said insurance should be a way of life. â€˜â€˜We have seen disastrous climatic conditions with the rains playing hide and seek with us for two years. Those who had their crop insured were saved from disaster. Donâ€™t plant any crop unless you insure it,â€™â€™ he advised.

Earlier, cardiologist Devi Shetty explained the Yashaswini scheme. He said under the scheme, each insured person has to pay Rs 5 per month (Rs 60 annual premium) and get almost every kind of operations performed for free at 50 hospitals all over the state. With 1.65 lakh farmers registering for the programme, a premium amount of Rs 1 crore was given to Dr Shetty at the function.

28,Organiser of suicide camp held under arms Act,"THANE: The Titwala police on Friday arrested Col Jayantrao Chitale (Retd) and â€˜Commandantâ€™ Sanjeev Atre of the Maharashtra Military Foundation under section 37 of the Mumbai Police Act for stocking swords and spears which were categorised as illegal weapons.

Both of them were later released on bail. The foundation, which claims to train youths to join the armed forces, recently announced that it was creating a suicide squad on the lines of the one proposed by Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray.

Shortly before his arrest, Col Chitale addressing a press conference at Badlapur, said that the swords used in the training were blunt.â€�You canâ€™t cut a candle with them, let alone injuring anybodyâ€™â€™ he said. Questioning the police action, Col Chitale asked, â€œSuch spears are found on all four sides of the bungalow belonging to the state industries minister Patangrao Kadam in Pune. Does this mean that he has violated the Act too?â€™â€™

The colonel said that the police action arose out of a misunderstanding. â€œWe had informed the prime minister, the home minister and various military officials before actually starting the camp.Unfortunately the authorities did not reply or respond to our letters.â€™â€™

Col Chitale claimed that such training camps were the need of the hour as the extremists were in a very aggressive mood. â€œIs it really necessary to take permission for such activities meant to safeguard the freedom of the country?â€™â€™ he asked, comparing the participants in his â€˜commando training campâ€™ to freedom fighters who had not sought permission from the British government.

The foundation, he claimed, had been invited by the Pune police to provide volunteers for Ganesh Utsav, Ambedkar Jayanti and Ramzan. â€œIf the government feels that we are violating the law by running the camp we will stop it,â€™â€™ he added. Mr Chitale, claimed that the training camp had nothing to do with any political party.

The land where the camp is held spread over 15 acres was given by the government 20 years ago at a concessional rate, Mr Chitale said. Meanwhile, many youths have already arrived to participate in the second batch scheduled to begin from November 18.
