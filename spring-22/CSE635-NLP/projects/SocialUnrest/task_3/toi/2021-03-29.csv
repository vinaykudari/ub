0,Foster care rules to be revised,"NEW DELHI: It''s an attempt to provide every child with a loving family environment. And if all goes well, disability, ailment age or gender will not be a barrier between a child and a loving home.

The Delhi government is reframing the fitness rules applicable on an individual offering to provide foster care.

According to social welfare department officials, the step is being initiated with the help of various NGOs and institutions working in the field of adoption and foster care.

""The main objective is to keep kids out of institutions. An institution can never compensate for the care and lessons in social skills a child gets in a family,"" said the official.

As a concept, foster care is not very popular in India, and next to non-existent in Delhi. A family offering foster care has no legal rights over the child.

""Most Indian families want to adopt a fair, male child who is preferably a month or two old,"" said Vineeta Bhargav of Alternative Parenting Association.

This, along with very rigid fitness rules for individuals offering foster care, makes sure that next to no one offers foster care.

""The rules so far favour families over single persons. Anybody suffering from a disease like TB, hepatitis, or infected with HIV is not allowed to provide foster care under the present rules. We have proposed that such criteria be removed from the rules,"" said M N Vidyarthi, member Child Welfare Board.

2,Hospital understates gross income,"NEW DELHI: Machines and equipment worth Rs 3.24 crore, bought by the research section of AIIMS during 2001-02, were not depicted in the institute''s balance sheet for that year.

This observation has been made in the institute''s last audit report, for the 2001-02 financial year.

The machines had been acquired for special schemes, and purchases made out of grants received from both government and private bodies over a period.

Thus, the assets and liabilities as listed in the institute''s accounts, have been understated by Rs 3.24 crore.

The report further points out: ""This is a very serious procedural lapse which may lead to pilferage...""

The institute had, in its reply, said that if these assets were suddenly entered into the balance sheets, unexplained differences would arise in the same. Such an argument is, however, rejected in the audit report as ""not tenable"".

An AIIMS spokesperson said, ""The action on the report has already been taken. Regarding machinery and equipment, it was simply separate accounting of the items meant for research. It does not indicate the possibility of any pilferage or misuse at all.""

In a separate observation, the report says the institute had understated its income by Rs 5.98 crore.

Credit balance was detected in the accounts of thallium tests (Rs 33,44,818), laboratory tests (Rs 23,30,269), cardiac tests (Rs 43,30,274) and in the gamma knife account (Rs 4,98,03,468).

The money received by the institute from the patients for the tests and the grant received under the gamma knife head, were not depicted in the income and expenditure accounts.

The institute had described the funds for the tests as ""revolving funds"", meaning that the money received from patients is spent on the laboratory concerned.

The audit report, however clearly states that ""This is not tenable as the transactions of these funds are not being accounted for under revolving funds....and the approval of the grant sanctioning authority has not been produced.""

In addition to several other observations on the accounts of the institute, the audit found that Rs 14,721,61, given by the institute to its various officials, as advances under different heads, ""were not being recovered from the concerned individuals for the last several years"".

Reacting to this, the AIIMS spokesperson said, ""Appropriate action has been taken in this case too. Appropriate institutional and procedural mechanisms exist in AIIMS to take care of all such situations and the possibility of advances not being recovered does not exist.""

3,Delhi Police prepare for election,"NEW DELHI: Fearing violence during the impending Lok Sabha elections, Delhi Police have sought 40 companies of central paramilitary forces from the home ministry to maintain vigil in the city.

About 25 companies had been pressed into service during last year''s Assembly polls in the city.

A senior police officer, however, admitted it was unlikely that more than 25 companies would be allotted to them.

""The election in Delhi coincides with that in 16 other states and Union Territories and we just hope that we have at least 25 companies. We will try and make up for the shortfall with the Home Guards,"" said the officer.

More than 10,000 Home Guards are expected to be pressed into service for the elections.

The police have also prepared a list of more than 900 criminals who are likely to indulge in bootlegging and arms supply during the elections.

""They are all ''bad characters'' of their respective areas and have a past record of creating problems during elections,"" added the officer.

The licences of all firearm owners will be verified in the next few days. ""Even valid licence holders will not be allowed to move around with firearms. All district deputy commissioners of police (DCPs) have been asked to verify the licences within a week,"" he said.

The special branch of Delhi Police has also prepared a list of sensitive areas. They have been further divided into communally sensitive places and areas from where bogus voting has been reported in the past.

These include areas like Okhla, Seemapuri, Mongolpuri, Kalyanpuri, Seelampur and the walled city.

""The list will help the Election Commission decide on which booth is sensitive or hyper-sensitive,"" stated an officer.

Help has also been sought from the MCD to prevent defacing of buildings by party workers. ""The police is empowered to act against those defacing public buildings. For private buildings, we have sought help from the Corporation,"" said an officer.

4,DPM latches onto Parthiv for polls,"AHMEDABAD: With the BJP planning to ride the wave of Team India''s performance in Pakistan for the polls, cricket came in handy for deputy prime minister LK Advani as he began his campaign in his constituency, Gandhinagar, on Sunday.

And, it was Parthiv Patel who got the DPM the most cheers and claps as he praised the ""local boy"".

Addressing three gatherings during the day, Advani''s speeches were heavy with cricket analogy. Calling the polls a ""political match"", Advani said that it was like the US, a country that does not play cricket, deciding to take on world champions Australia.

""The result is known even before the first ball is bowled,"" he told a gathering of party workers and onlookers at Shahpur, where he inaugurated an election office.

Later, at Asarwa, his praise for Parthiv evoked a cheer from the crowd. Advani, who was accompanied by wife Kamla and daughter Pratibha, was presented a cricket bat by a group of BJP supporters.He then wished Team India all the best and said the recent victory over Pakistan in the ODIs had boosted the ''feelgood'' factor.

Advani also announced that he would file his nomination at the ''vijay muhurat'' of 12.39 pm on Monday, after which he would leave for Porbander to begin the second leg of his yatra that would last 16 days.

In Shahpur, Advani compared the 14th Lok Sabha election to a cricket match to be fought between the BJP and the Congress. ""A forecast in this match is not necessary. Ask any voter in the country and he will tell you that Atal Bihari Vajpayee will take over as prime minister once again. It is much like the country''s first two elections in 1952 and 1957, when Jawaharlal Nehru becoming the prime minister was a foregone conclusion,"" he said.

The new election office was filled with cheers from party members and supporters who shouted slogans and burst crackers. However, in minority-dominated Shahpur, Muslims did not turn up for the programme. The only one present was chairman of the Gujarat Waqf Board, Yusuf Qureshi, who garlanded Advani.

""This election will ensure that India achieves the status of a developed nation within a few years. This will be possible because the BJP stands for credibility,"" asserted Advani. Later in the day, he addressed party workers'' meets at Shahibaug and Ghatlodia and inaugurated election offices at Vasna and Nava Wadaj.

5,Amarinder govt violating model code: Badal,"BHAGTA BHAI KA (Bathinda): Shiromani Akali Dal chief Parkash Singh Badal has accused the state government of violating the model code of conduct. He said the SAD would raise the issue with chief election commission during a meeting of national parties convened by the commission in New Delhi on April 6.

Apprehensive of irregularities and booth capturing in the state, Badal demanded the appointment of a central election observer in all 13 parliamentary constituencies in the state.

Talking to mediapersons before addressing an impressive party rally at Bhagta Bhai Ka town of Bathinda in favour of Paramjeet Kaur, SAD Lok Sabha candidate from Bathinda seat, Badal alleged the Amarinder government brazenly violated the model code of conduct. He said the government''s move of recruiting 20,000 Home Guards for ten days has sole motive of misusing them for booth capturing and bogus voting.

''''As the chief minister is panicky with the inevitable defeat of his wife at the hustings, so he was using all unfair means to win the election at any cost,'''' alleged Badal. He said that a major portion of the to-be-recruited Home Guards will be from Patiala so that the chief minister''s wife could use this to woo voters. ''''When thousands of Home Guards in the state police have not received their salaries for the last many months, the new recruitments is a cruel joke,'''' said Badal.

Badal was also very critical of some ''''slanderous'''' advertisements in some vernacular newspapers. ''''I hold the media in high esteem but it was unfortunate that some papers were carrying advertisements against me and my family members, having very derogatory and offensive language.

I can never expect decency from Congress and its cronies but the media should adhere to the advertisement code and avoid targeting my family in an unfair manner in these advertisements when no court had held me ever guilty in any case,'''' said Badal. ''''In last assembly elections, Amarinder himself gave these advertisements but now when he is facing a defamation case for this offence, some of his ''chamchas'' were carrying the job. All this blasphemous campaign against my family is being funded by the state government,'''' alleged Badal.

Speaking at the rally, Paramjeet Kaur, the party candidate, said that improving education and water facilities would be her topmost priority as the area of Mansa and Bathinda was gripped by these twin problems for the last many decades.

6,Ex-minister's son behind bars,"LUCKNOW: Contrary to usual image of politicians, this former Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MLA from Mau Manipur assembly segment of Bundelkhand was always known for his simple life, standing testimony to the fact that exceptions do exist in every field.

His mode of transport was rickshaws and tempos and he was a living symbol of ""simple living and high thinking"".

But his teenaged son, it seems, was stuck in the groove of the ""spoilt brat"" image. Little wonder, opting for company of youngsters who chose to make ""fast bucks"", this son of the former minister for Prisons and Public Works Department (PWD) in the Kalyan Singh regime has landed himself behind bars on the charge of lifting motorcycles.

Meet Vishwadeepak Kureel, son of former minister Mannu Lal Kureel. Two of Vishwadeepak''s friends, Mukesh and Vinay, were also arrested on Sunday by Hazratganj police who intercepted the trio riding two motorcycles near Laxman Mela ground.

While verifying documents of the motorcycles, it was found that the vehicles - LML Freedom - were stolen ones.

Identified as Mukesh Kumar Verma (16) of Vinay Khand in Gomti Nagar and Kishore Sharma of Mohammed Nagar in Malihabad, the duo revealed that the stolen motorcycles were given to them by one Babban of Vinay Khand in Gomtinagar.

Babban who was a listed auto-lifter. At the time of taking the motorcycles, Mukesh and Vinay were not aware that they were stolen ones.

But the moment they realised it, they tried to find Babban and hand him back the motorcycles. But Babban had ''disappeared''.

Fearing that they may land in trouble, they decided to fix registration numbers of their motorcycles - which they had given to Babban - on the stolen ones, only to be nabbed by the police on Sunday.

This was their first brush with crime. And they ended up in jail. Babban was untraceable.

Police said one of the motorcycles was lifted outside Tulsi complex and the second was stolen from Rajajipuram area under Talkatora police station.

7,BSP may poach on Rabri ministers,"LUCKNOW: To broaden its base outside Uttar Pradesh, Bahujan Samaj Party has decided to put up 40 candidates from Bihar.

Party president Mayawati who is scheduled to visit Patna in a day or two may spring a surprise by announcing names of the contestants there.

Taking advantage of the Bihar ministers'' desire to contest the Lok Sabha poll, the BSP may field some of the ministers of the Rabri Devi government in the fray.

Ministers whose names are making the rounds in this connection are Ramai Ram, Purnmasi Ram, Rama Devi and Cheddi Paswan.

Sources in the party said that Ramai Ram may be given Hajipur, Purnmasi Ram-Bagha and Rama Devi-Motihari.

Cheddi Paswan wants to contest from Sasaram, said sources. Along with these dalits, Rajan Tiwari, an independent MLA with criminal history, may also be given BSP ticket to contest the poll in Bettia.

These leaders though still with the RJD have been nursing a grievance against Laloo Prasad Yadav.

Ever since the RJD chief has forged ties with Ram Vilas Paswan of Lok Janshakti Party, Ramai Ram has been annoyed.

Rama Devi''s anger with Laloo began when her husband, a minister, was killed brutally and the Bihar government failed to arrest the killers.

BSP''s decision to put up candidates in Bihar is aimed at cutting into RJD''s votes and also opening its account in the neighbouring state.

The RJD chief had earned the ire of Mayawati when, last year, Laloo won over four BSP MLAs in Bihar and enrolled them in RJD.

They were made ministers in the Rabri Devi government. BSP has already announced to put up candidates for all the forty seats in Bihar. Samajwadi Party too has decided to contest all seats in Bihar.

Law minister Shakil Ahmad Khan, Shivanand Tiwari, Upendra Verma and Dadan Yadav, an independent MLA, too want to contest the Lok Sabha election. This becuaase of the perception that Laoo government may not last after the polls.

Meanwhile, the BSP leaders now want Mayawati to contest from the Bijnore Lok Sabha seat. She is likely to take a decision in this regard in a day or two, said a party leader.

8,Bar raids not linked to politics: Police chief,"MUMBAI: The Mumbai police on Saturday night raided 62 bars across the city, leaving bar owners fuming and frothing at the mouth.

President of the Fight For the Rights of Bar Owners Association, Manjeet Singh Sethi said that politicians should have a ""transparent"" systemof knocking out money from bar owners.

""Politicians invite businessmen and corporates to parties and seek funds for elections. Why don''t they invite bar owners to similar parties instead of using pressure tactics?"" he asked.

Sethi said he had provided the police witha list of 54 shady bars in Mumbai. ""Of the 54, they have raided only one (Evergreen). Why are they not raiding the others?"" he asked.

He said the police should not waste manpower raiding bars, but first cleanse its own staff of those who collect haftas.

Meanwhile, police commissioner A N Roy said, ""I don''t want to reply to baseless allegations made by bar owners,many of whom have dubious credentials.""

He denied that the raids had anything to do with politics. ""Politicians are not even aware of the raids,"" he told TNN.

""The raids have been conducted under my supervision and we have spared bars that were functioning legally. In 30 bars, we found girls indulging in obscenity, soliciting customers and places remaining open beyond 1.30 a.m.""

Roy said the police are already burdened with other priorities. ""Raiding bars is not a priority. But we are doing it in a big way to punish those involved in illegal activities,"" he said.

Bars raided on Saturday night included Basuri and Bumper in south Mumbai; Samudra Mahal, Ocean, Dock Master, Evergreen, Titli, Classic, Madeera, Priyanka, Raj Palace, Green Art, Utsav, Highway, Hardeep Punjab and Tipsy in central Mumbai; Sant Punjab, Antakshari, In hotel, Vaishali and NandDeep in the eastern suburbs; Campus, J-49, Pushpak and Oshiwara in the western suburbs; and Meridian, Vishkanya and Sursangeet in north Mumbai.

9,"State govt, cinemas in show-stopping showdown","MUMBAI: Board exams are over, summer vacations have begun, the India-Pakistan ODI series has ended and Bollywood has just had some releases.

Cinemas across the city should be bustling with people, but the crowds are missing. That''s because for 11 days 120 single-screen theatres in the city have been on strike, protesting against the state government''s ""failure"" to implement its decision to cut entertainment tax.

In November 2003, the state assembly had decided to bring down entertainment tax from 55 per cent to 45 per cent for singlescreen theatres.

It had also allowed the theatre owners to increase the service charge from Rs 3 to Rs 4 per seat. These decisions were approved by the governor in December 2003, but have not yet been implemented.

The state says it has not implemented the decisions because theatre owners are reluctant to guarantee that they won''t pass on the tax relief to the public.

The government fears that theatres may hike ticket prices once the tax is slashed. Theatres are not willing to commit unconditionally that they will not hike prices, says R C Joshi, principal secretary (Revenue).

Meanwhile, the CinematographExhibitors Association (CEA) says it does not want to lose the right to determine ticket prices. Single-screen cinemas are today competing with multiplexes and TV channels, the owners say.

Some theatres, like New Shirin Talkies at Jacob Circle, have tickets priced as low as Rs 15 for a stall seat and Rs 20 for balcony, they point out.

Only the high-end theatres charge Rs 70 and Rs 100. They add that multiplexes are given tax holidays for the first five years.

""With TV channels showing almost six movies a day and a plethora of soap operas, theatre audiences have decreased considerably. And when there are cricket matches, it becomes worse,"" says Kiran Shantaram, owner of Plaza theatre in Dadar.

On the day of the first India-Pakistan one-dayer, the 880-seat Plaza drew only 14 buffs for a superhit film like ''Munnabhai MBBS''.

Disagreements among theatre owners are also not helping their cause. When the CEA went on strike, some of its members were unhappy.

The owner of Maratha Mandir, Manoj Desai, says, ""The government is not going to budge anyway and we''ll have to withdraw the strike after losing business-just like we had to eat humble pie in October last year.""

But CEA president Nester D''Souza,who is also CEO of Metro cinema, Marine Lines, claims that it was because of a strike that the government increased the service charge and reduced the tax by 10 per cent.

""But maybe they should have moved the court, rather than resorting to a strike,"" notes distributor and exhibitor Shyam Shroff.

The disagreement is evident even in Plaza, where Vinayak Mayekar, who runs the theatre on contract, differs with the owner.

Mayekar says the strike is unnecessary and he would run a film the moment someone supplies him a print.

Despite the problems, single-screen theatre owners say they cannot shut shop even if they want to.

Shroff says, ""The government stipulates that the owner retain one-third portion of the area as a theatre. Perhaps the government thinks that the closure of theatres would deprive people of entertainment. But we have multiplexes coming up and therefore it''s unfair to force single-screen theatres to stay open.""

Adds Shantaram, ""Nowhere in the world will you find such a skewed rule where we don''t have the choice to shut shop-especially when the taxes are so high.""

Historian Sharada Dwivedi does not want to see the theatres shut shop, but she says the government''s short-sighted attitude is not helping the theatres survive either.

""It would be a tremendous loss to the city''s heritage if the theatres close down,"" she says.

10,China defence minister visits Mumbai dock,"MUMBAI: For the first time since the naval dockyardâ€™s inception here in 1799, a high-powered 18-member Chinese military delegation led by defence minister Gen Cao Gangchuan visited it and studied some of the its latest ships and equipment.

The visit assumes significance because India had refused security clearance to China Harbour Engineering Company, which had bid for dredging of a channel in the Mumbai Port Trust in October 2000. This company was owned by the Chinese government and the defence ministry felt sensitive information would be leaked. It has now sued for damages.

But on Sunday, the Chinese delegation got a warm welcome. Chinese experts asked questions about the weapons systems, their firing range and the sensors on board these ships. They also merrily took photographs while one member of the delegation wielded a video camera off and on.

11,'Tagore principles more important',"KOLKATA: Nobel laureate and noted economist Amartya Sen did not even look at his medallion after the day he received it. He felt it was more important to work towards a better future by imbibing the great ideas which had fetched the award.

Referring to the theft of Tagoreâ€™s Nobel medallion, he said on his arrival here on Sunday: â€˜â€˜There is indeed a sense of tragic and sad loss. But it will be a great mistake to concentrate on just the medallion and not work to implement Tagoreâ€™s ideas and shape the nation according to the vision the great poet.â€�

â€˜â€˜I myself have not seen the medallion after the day I received it. It must be in some wardrobe of my wife. I do not look at it every day after I get up in the morning,â€™â€™ Sen said. He said adhering to the philosophy and vision of Rabindranath is more important than the medal.

Tagoreâ€™s vision and idea of nation has taken a serious beating in recent times, he felt. â€˜â€˜The riots in the name of religion, hunger, poverty and the way the future of democracy is threatened have been contrary to the views of Tagore. I feel the view he had of India as a secular democracy needs to be upheld.â€™â€™

Regretting that this philosophy is waning, he said: â€˜â€˜We do not often see a reflection of his ideals in the current scenario of the country. People need to know what he actually thought about our country and what he wanted this nation to be. His idealism needs to be seriously contemplated.â€�

12,572 arrested in Mumbai raids,"MUMBAI: In a second major crackdown on bars in a month, the city police on Saturday night arrested 572 persons, including bar girls, bar owners and patrons, on charges of obscenity and prostitution.

In all, 62 bars were raided of which 30 were found to be flouting the law. Among them was the popular J49 pub in Juhu, operating way beyond the stipulated closing time of 1.30 am, the police said. Three bars in central Mumbai â€” Samudra Mahal, Evergreen and Dock Master â€” are likely to be sealed and their employees booked under the Prevention of Immoral Trafficking Act.

The raids came close on the heels of similar raids in February 25, when 1,500 persons were held from 52 bars. These two raids in the span of a month has rattled bar owners, who claim to pay regular haftas to policemen to keep their â€œdo number ka dhandaâ€� running.

Fight For Right Bar Ow-ners Association president Manjeet Singh Sethi said: â€˜â€˜The message is clear. The raids are being conducted for money. Either they want us to hike haftas or to fund the poll campaigns of certain politicians.â€™â€™

He added that politici-ans should have a â€˜â€˜transparentâ€™â€™ system of taking money from bar owners. â€˜â€˜Politicians invite businessmen and corporates to parties and seek funds. Why not invite bar owners to similar parties instead of using pressure tactics.â€�

Commissioner A N Roy denied the raids had anything to do with politics. â€˜â€˜Politicians arenâ€™t even aware of it. The raids are being conducted under my supervision and we have spared those which are functioning legally.â€�

13,BJP feels surrogate ad pinch,"NEW DELHI: First, some BJP sympathisers ran a surrogate ad on TV, with scenes from the freedom struggle including clips of Bhagat Singh going to the gallows, Mahatma Gandhiâ€™s Dandi March and voices in the background asking the videshis to leave India. Then came the punchline: â€˜â€˜Do you want a videshi to rule the country now?â€™â€™

Now, some Congress sympathisers have hit back, with an equally devastating surrogate ad on TV. It, too showed scenes from the freedom struggle but asked the question: â€˜â€˜Do you want a mukhbir (police informer) to rule the country?â€™â€™

If the first ad did not mention Congress president Sonia Gandhi, the second does mention the Prime Minister â€” the reference is to an incident way back in 1942 during the freedom struggle when Atal Bihari Vajpayee was arrested at Bateshwar near Agra for participating in a demonstration and secured an early release after 23 days, apparently because he gave the names of other participants who had not been caught.

Vajpayee has since said that his was an â€˜â€˜unconditionalâ€™â€™ release and without any surety, and his sympathisers say he was too young and apolitical to understand the implications.

Whatever be the case, the battle is now truly joined. On Monday, the BJP shot off a letter to the Election Commission complaining about three TV ads released by a Sajhi Virasat Trust. In his letter, general secretary Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said the first two ads â€˜â€˜purport to express dissatisfaction of some perons with the state of affairs in the countryâ€™â€™. He added that the language used in them was similar to the print ads released by the Congress.

Claiming that this was a violation of the ECâ€™s instructions banning political advertising on TV, Naqvi then gets to the third ad.
