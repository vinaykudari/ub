0,No need for my nod to arrest MLA: Speaker,"BANGALORE: Legislative Assembly Speaker M.V. Venkatappa on Tuesday clarified that the police did not require his permission to arrest Anekal MLA A. Narayanaswamy.

In a press release, the Speakerâ€™s office has said: â€œThe Speaker has clarified there is no need for the police to seek his permission, unless the arrest takes place in the legislative Assembly precincts. He has also said that he has not received any written request from the Bangalore rural police on the issue, nor is it necessary.â€™â€™

The Bangalore rural police has registered a case of abetment to suicide against Narayanaswamy and five others, after Anekal town municipal council chief Manjula Adikeshava named them in her suicide note.

Meanwhile, the HC on Tuesday adjourned hearing of an application filed for anticipatory bail by Narayanswamy.

1,Desperation for jobs led to clashes,"NEW DELHI: A staggering 74 lakh people applied for heavy manual labour against 20,000 vacancies in the railways.

The cyber capital of Secunderabad topped the chart with 12 lakh applicants for 2,700 vacancies. Next is Kolkata with 11 lakh applications for 2,000 vacancies.

The railway recruitment for the lowest, â€˜Dâ€™, category, has also resulted in a minor inter-state tussle between Assam and Bihar. The attendance ratio of Sunday examination held in Guwahati could explain why the Assamese are upset.

For the first exam on November 9, 93,000 examinees were issued call letters from Guwahati and 60 per cent of them turned up. But after the â€˜â€˜outsiderâ€™â€™ issue agitated the Assamese, only 45 per cent appeared for the exam on Sunday.

Does it mean that 55 per cent of the candidates were from outside the state? Railway officials are not willing to hazard a guess. But they admit that the situation is the result of rules that allow candidates to put in multiple applications. A person can apply in the Patna, Guwahati and Kolkata railway recruitment board (RRB) offices simultaneously.

Most people in the eastern region apply at the Guwahati RRB because traditionally competition is said to be less in this centre. Some Rail Bhawan officials said candidates from as far as Karnataka and Tamil Nadu had applied at the Guwahati RRB.

This is the first time that an all-India selection for category â€˜Dâ€™ employees is being done by the RRBs. Obviously, politics did play a part in staggering the examination schedule, thereby allowing multiple applications. If the exam had been held on the same date in all the centres, there would have been no inter-state tussles.

2,Anti-Bihari violence spreads,"GUWAHATI/PATNA/MUMBAI: The Army was called out in Tinsukia in upper Assam on Tuesday after a person hailing from Bihar was killed. Some houses and shops were burnt in other areas of Assam.

An all-party meet, convened by Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi, resolved to seek the Prime Ministerâ€™s intervention to defuse the situation and review the present railway hiring policy, to ensure preference is given to local people for group C and D jobs.

Tinsukia is the only town in Assam where Biharis are in a majority. The district administration has closed all educational institutions in the town for two days, as a precaution.

In Patna, the state government said armed police escorts will be deployed on all trains passing through Bihar to and from the north-east states, to ensure security. Seven companies of Central para-military forces will be deployed at different railway stations.

Meanwhile in Mumbai, the youth wing of the Shiv Sena ransacked the office of the Railway Recruitment Board at the central station on Tuesday to express anger at the alleged preference given to non-Maharashtrians in jobs.

â€˜â€˜Biharis and UPwallahs keep pouring into the metropolis for jobs in central government establishments. The Marathi jobless youth canâ€™t be expected to sit, twiddling their thumbs. Assam, too, is facing a similar situation,â€™â€™ said Raj Thackeray, head of the Sena youth wing.

The RRB in Mumbai appears to have got 6.5 lakh applications for 2,200 vacancies of gangmen, khalasis and other class-D category jobs. The examination for the first batch was on November 16 and most of the examinees were said to be from other states. The Sena wanted the entire exams to be postponed or cancelled. The ransacking was carried out after the board head refused to do it as it was an all-India exam.

The All Assam Students Union took note of the happenings in Mumbai and alleged Union railway minister Nitish Kumar was encouraging the hiring of people from his home state, Bihar, over others.

Meanwhile in Bihar, the number of arrests of people charged with inflicting violence on train passengers from the north-east rose to 41 on Tuesday, the authorities said.

3,Karun Srivastava demotes law officer after lapse,"MUMBAI: Civic chief Karun Srivastava, embarrassed after the city civil court attached his chair and table for contempt of court, demoted law officer Shabbir Ujjainwala while promoting his deputy Hemant Tendulkar to that post.

Civic sources said the move does not come as a surprise since Mr Srivastava was extremely â€œupsetâ€™â€™ over the negative publicity generated over the court attachment decree.

In fact, he had to publicly concede to â€œlapsesâ€™â€™ by the civic legal department. The official version, however, is that Mr Ujjainwala, who is junior to Mr Tendulkar, was promoted as law officer only because the latter was facing a departmental inquiry.

â€œBut since the inquiry recently exonerated him of corruption charges, he had to be given his rightful promotion,â€™â€™ a senior civic official said.

Meanwhile, additional municipal commissioner Subrato Ratho is likely to submit an inquiry report on the ""lapses"" committed by various civic officials in the Jennifer Fernandes case within the next three days.

4,Mann urges governor to hold early SGPC polls,"CHANDIGARH: SAD (A) chief Simranjit Singh Mann has urged Punjab governor O P Verma to hold early elections to the SGPC which were due two year ago.

The party has sought a ban on foreign tours of some SGPC members who have committed â€˜â€˜grave immoral actsâ€™â€™ and tarnished the image of the organisation and the community.

In a memorandum submitted to Verma, the five SGPC members owing allegiance to Mann have named these SGPC members and their alleged lapse which must invite some punitive measures.

In some cases, the cases are pending before the Sikh Judicial Commission. A supporter of Mann has filed a case against SGPC president Gurcharan Singh Tohra and 30 others for recovery of 31 lakh from the Sikh Educational Society. Another case pertains to a trust allegedly formed with gurdwara money and used for the benefit of Tohra and SAD leader Parkash Singh Badal.

The memorandum refers to former SGPC chief Bibi Jagir Kaur being an accused in the murder case of her daughter and another member Sadhu Singh who has been caught many times with contrabands while another SGPC member has a hotel which is allegedly notorious for its shady activities.

5,Mulayam defends his minister,"LUCKNOW: Stoutly defending himself, minister for externally-aided project Bhagwati Singh has urged chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav to hold a high-level inquiry into the charges allegedly levelled against him by senior IAS officer Harish Chandra.

The officer, who is posted as principal secretary, home guards, has charged the minister with threatening him and demanded security for himself through a letter written by him to chief secretary AP Singh.

Both the minister and the officer are locked in a dispute over a piece of land in Bakshi-Ka-Talab area.

Earlier, Bhagwati Singh, who is an MLC, raised the question in the Council House, which also got the whole issue probed by a House committee for social harmony.

But the contention of the officer was that Bhagwati Singh himself was the member on the committee which had probed the case in which Singh himself was involved.

6,Corporator Ekbote held in Wai riot,"PUNE: The Satara police on Tuesday arrested independent Pune corporator Milind Ekbote for his alleged involvement in Sundayâ€™s riot at Wai near Satara.

Superintendent of police (Satara) Prashant Borde told TNN on Tuesday that Ekbote had been arrested and remanded to police custody for two days because he had been part of the rioting mob.

Borde claimed that the situation was under control and added that 12 more people were detained on Tuesday. The police had arrested 22 on Monday.

Local MP Laxman Patil and district collector Omprakash Gupta have been holding peace meetings across the town, which will continue into Wednesday.

Independent reports from Wai, however, said the town remained tense after a couple of shops were reportedly set afire.

The windshield and windows of a jeep were also broken by a mob. It may be recalled that tension gripped Wai on Sunday after the news spread that cattle was being brought to the town in a tempo for slaughter.

The tempo, carrying the animals, was stopped by a group of people and four persons, including the driver, were assaulted.

This led to clashes, stone throwing and arson at various places in Wai. Curfew was imposed in the town and platoons of the State Reserve Police Force (SRPF) were deployed.

7,Farmers stage protest near CCI office,"BATHINDA: About 1,000 farmers of the cottongrowing areas of Muktsar, Bathinda, Mansa and Ferozepur staged a protest in front of the office of the Cotton Corporation of India (CCI) here on Tuesday afternoon.

The farmers, who staged the dharna on the call given by the Bhartiya Kisan Union-Ekta (Sidhupur and Ugrah), Democratic Farmers Association, Kirti Kisan Union, Punjab Kisan Sabha, All India Kirti Kisan Sabha, Kisan Sangrash Committee and Agriculture and Farmers Development Front, alleged that the government agencies were intentionally delaying the procurement of cotton in mandis, which had left them at the mercy of private traders.

Farmer leaders alleged that in the absence of government agencies, the farmers were under compulsion to sell their produce at a lower price to private traders.

The farmers demanded that the law-enforcing agencies were taking a lenient view of the sale of spurious pesticides, insecticides and seeds by some unscrupulous dealers. They alleged that though the market was stuffed with spurious pesticides and seeds, the police and agriculture department authorities had not initiated action against the guilty.

The farmers asked the government to clarify its policy on Bt cotton. They alleged that at the time when the government was in a dilemma over the genetically modified seed, unscrupulous traders were fleecing gullible farmers.

8,Many hurt in police-mob clash,"PATNA: The police fired at least 30 rounds on Tuesday in order to disperse a violent mob of people protesting against the killing of a person near the Durga Mandir close to Shivnar village on the Patna-Mokama road under the Mokama police station. However, no one was hurt in the firing, according to the police.

The agitators blocked the road while demonstrating with the body of the slain person, Karu Mahto. The police also fought a pitched battle with the mob. At least half a dozen people, including officer in charge of the Mokama police station K Chandra, two constables and the driver of a police vehicle, were hurt in the brickbatting.

The trouble started on Tuesday morning following the recovery of Karuâ€™s body by the police from the bank of Ganga river at Shivnar village. The news of Karuâ€™s killing spread like wildfire in the area, and people from the adjacent villages assembled near the site of the blockade demanding immediate arrest of the alleged killer of Karu, Viveka Singh, who had been released from jail a few months ago.

The reports reaching here said Karuâ€™s son Sujit Kumar had earlier been kidnapped allegedly by Viveka. â€œViveka was trying to persuade Karu to go into an agreement for the closure of the case lodged with the police in connection with the kidnapping of Sujit,â€� alleged a source in Mokama while explaining the reason for Karuâ€™s murder. In the meantime, the police had made a prayer in the court concerned for the attachment of the property of Viveka in the same case.

Incidentally, on Tuesday morning, the Mokama police attached the property of Viveka soon after the murder of Karu.

The mob turned violent before the arrival of additional forces from Patna. It started pelting the police party with brickbats and damaging vehicles passing through the spot. The attack on the police party and subsequent injuries caused to some policemen led to the police opening fire to quell the mob.

When contacted on phone, the officer in charge of the Mokama police station said a case has been lodged with the police station in connection with the road blockade and violence, adding that one person, Garib Sah, was arrested on spot.

9,Mimicry to be included in school syllabi,"HYDERABAD: The government has agreed to include mimicry as an art form in school curriculum and also in competitions organised by schools.

This is being done with a motive to encourage and develop the talent of children in this art form.

This decision is a response to a representation given by popular mimicry artist Dr Nerella Venumadhav. Venumadhav, in his appeal, said that schools do not include mimicry as an item in competitions in their programmes. He also urged the government to direct schools to introduce it as an item of art competitions.

The government has asked the Director of School Education to give instructions to all district educational officers and assistant project coordinators, district primary education programme to incorporate mimicry as a part of art curriculum and conduct competitions at school level.

Addressing a press conference here on Tuesday, Venumadhav said there are as many as 20 students in diploma courses in mimicry at Telugu University. He said most students, who have additional training in mimicry, apart from their main degree, are easily chosen for jobs. Students with mimicry diploma are being preferred by the Railways also, Venumadhav said.

Mimicry is more evolved in India than in any other country in the world, Venumadhav said.

â€œI started learning mimicry in 1947 and as a teacher, I used to give lectures changing my voice as per the character I was referring to. This made the class interesting and helped the students to develop interest in the lessons,â€™â€™ Venumadhav said.

One needs to practice regularly to become a good mimicry artist, Venumadhav said. Sometimes, this art may land you in tight spots. One should should be very careful while imitating others, he added.

10,Some MLAs find polls a big groan,"HYDERABAD: It is not only the Election Commission which is in no hurry to schedule the elections, some experienced candidates too are dreading the prospect of hitting the campaign trail again.

For, election campaigning means ceaseless travel, missed meals and sleep, long walks through dusty lanes, voice gone hoarse from speaking too much too often and disruption of oneâ€™s daily routine.

Sanatnagar legislator Sripathi Rajeshwar says Elections turn him into a rakshasa.

â€œThatâ€™s what I become during elections. I donâ€™t even get a wink of sleep,â€� he says. â€œIt is only when I travel in my car that I get to take a catnap.â€�

The run-up to the polls is threatening to be particularly long this time with the Election Commission expressing its inability to hold elections before March. The long hiatus does not mean that the average politico will be spared these travails.

Congress legislator from Asifnagar constituency D Nagender has already started his padayatras. He does 4 km everyday. This leaves no time for his 90-minute workouts. Itâ€™s going to get worse.

When the election season will peak, Nagender reckons he will have to walk for around 30 km everyday. â€œIn the last election, my supporters found it difficult to cope with that kind of schedule,â€� he says.

Nagender says he is managing to get five hours of sleep now. In the next few days, it may come down to just three hours.

Aspiring candidates are not willing to rest on their oars while the Election Commission takes its time to decide the election schedule.

â€œWeâ€™re used to the election-related problems like missing meals or lack of sleep. All that matters is winning,â€� says MIMâ€™s Asaduddin Owaisi.

Since winning is the only criteria, Sripathi Rajeshwar, who has contested five elections and won thrice, knows pretty well that it will be difficult to steal time for lunch as the election fever rises. â€œI have already started carrying a biscuit packet with me,â€� he says.

11,Police probe Golawala's link with Yasin Noor,"VADODARA: Alleged involvement in communal rioting, arms peddling, attempt to murder, suspected links with the underworld and now alleged connections with a suspected Lashkar-E-Toiba recruit Yasin Ibrahim Noor.

If sources in the Ahmedabad detection of crime branch (DCB) are to be believed Salim Golawala, wanted in a series of offences by Ahmedabad and Vadodara city police, may have a lot more to him than that has been unearthed so far.

Ahmedabad DCB officials said Golawalaâ€™s name cropped up during interrogation of Yasin, who was held from the Juhapura area of Ahmedabad for possessing an AK-47 rifle and ammunition. His son Kasim Noor and two others â€” Kirti Joshi and Prahlad Patel â€” were also nabbed in this connection.

Investigators are looking into the possible links of Yasin with terrorist outfits and his suspected involvement in funding nefarious activities in the country, including the July bomb blasts in Mumbai.

Golawala''s name cropped up in the episode when Yasin reportedly mentioned to crime branch officials that he had contacted Golawala to recruit men who could carry out terrorist activities.

Ahmedabad additional commissioner of police (crime) D G Vanzara said, ""Yasin has revealed during the interrogations that he had contacted four to five boys from Ahmedabad and Golawala from Vadodara to convince them to go for training in Pakistan. He had asked them to come for the purpose or convince people to do so.""

Vanzara said that Yasin had said that he had himself spoken to Golawala regarding the idea. ""Yasin has revealed that he had asked the youths to come to Dubai from where he would send them to Pakistan. However, whether Golawala actually did this is a matter of investigation,"" Vanzara said.

This is the second time in the recent past that Golawala''s name cropped up during investigation by the Ahmedabad police. Earlier, his name had surfaced as one who killed Rasul Ghanchi in Ahmedabad. Ghanchi was stabbed to death on November 9.

12,16 killed in fresh violence in Assam,"DIBRUGARH/GUWAHATI: At least 16 Biharis were killed across Assam since Tuesday, taking to 25 the toll in the current series of incidents since November 9, when some Assamese youth assaulted Bihari students and prevented them from taking the railway recruitment exams.

Four Hindi-speaking persons were shot dead and three injured in an Ulfa (United Liberation Front of Asom) attack near New Bongaigaon railway station on Wednesday evening. In Tinsukia district, bodies of three Biharis were recovered from Kakopathar.

The dead included a three-year-old who was hacked to death, according a PTI report. One person was killed in mob violence in Tinsukia town on Wednesday noon. Two more deaths were reported from Nalbari district.

Late Tuesday, six of a Bihari family were hacked to death at Kheronipathar in Dibrugarh district. The Army has been deployed in various parts of the state.

The administration on Wednesday clamped indefinite curfew in Tinsukia town, dominated by Hindi-speaking people.

Fresh trouble started in several localities of Tinsukia since early Wednesday, with armed Bihari groups going on a destruction spree. It was only after the police fired some rounds in the air that the mob could be dispersed.

Assam CM Tarun Gogoi said he has instructed all deputy commissioners and district superintendents of police to restore normalcy within 24 hours. â€˜â€˜Dibrugarh is badly affected. The killings of four truckers in Dhubri district on Tuesday evening were the handiwork of the Ulfa.â€™â€™

Gogoi said, â€˜â€˜My concern is the simmering situation. This should not happen and my only problem is shortage of forces. According to the Centreâ€™s assessment, the total requirement stands at 180 companies of paramilitary forces. But I have only 110 companies. Twenty companies have been withdrawn for poll duties in other states.â€™â€™

The situation in the industrial town of Duliajan continues to be tense. Oil production has been affected as drivers of tankers and Oil India Ltd vehicles have refused to drive following some violence.

Meanwhile, taking the demand of the All Assam Studentsâ€™ Union for 100 per cent job reservation for locals another step forward, Gogoi advocated for a review petition on the Supreme Court order of 1998 making recruitment in Central government organisations open for all Indian citizens. The Naga National Council, an underground outfit, has directed all Biharis living in Nagaland to leave the state immediately.

In Patna, Union minister for North-East affairs C P Thakur said he would submit to the Centre a report on the Assam violence.

13,EOU owners urge govt to examine S-T issue,"SURAT: With no redressal in sight regarding constraints due to imposition of sales tax on the export-oriented units (EOUs) despite representations to the finance ministry, EOU owners have sought intervention of the concerned ministry without any delay.

The South Gujarat & UT EOU Association (SGUTEOUA) urged the state government on Wednesday to take a decision as assured in a meeting held on July 24 with finance minister Vajubhai Vala in Gandhinagar so that the units could generate revenue for the public exchequer.

While officials at the headquarters of the sales tax department in Ahmedabad refused to divulge anything in this connection, the local authorities, on condition of anonymity, told TNN that so far on the basis of assessments made in the case of 60 units, Rs 2 crore has been demanded as sales tax and by the end of this month, another Rs 2 crore would be added as sales tax arrears in the case of EOUs here.

With no solution forthcoming, the EOUs have reduced their business, SGUTEOUA president Manoj Gandhi told TNN. When asked about imposition of sales tax on EOUs after a gap of almost 20 years since formation of EOUs, authorities in the sales tax department said the matter perhaps was never brought to their notice.

EOU owners have been exploring possibilities of setting up their units in other states and, in fact, some of them have already shifted their base to Nandurbar and other parts in neighbouring Maharashtra.

When contacted, sales tax official SP Chandurikar told TNN that a representation of EOU owners was made to the state government but they were not aware of any decision in this connection.

Raids on EOUs by the authorities have been continuing. So far, assessments in the case of about 60 EOUs in South Gujarat had been made, said officials.

14,Development plan for state Capital approved,"GANDHINAGAR: The Gujarat government has approved the development plan for the state capital under which several measures have been proposed integrated development of square km Gandhinagar area and the surrounding 39 villages.

Giving the details of the plan, urban development minister IK Jadeja said that all possible efforts would be made to maintain the special identity of green city and at the same time construction of high rise residential buildings would not allowed in the plots allocated MLAs and MPs in the notified area of the capital city.

In order to retain the organised planning and development, the government has decided not to allow setting up of shops and other commercial establishments.

As per the guidelines evolved for the new development plan, the construction of commercial buildings would allowed only on both sides roads in sectors 2,3,5 and 6. order to avoid traffic congestion in this commercial area, the entry would be restricted through six meter wide service road.

The state government has decided to develop 929 hectare land in Sarasan,Kudasan,Dholakuva, Randesan,Vasna-Hadmatiya, Tarapur, Uvarsad, Pore, Vavol, Raysan and Indroda villages. similar status will be accorded to seven villages which be developed as nucleus villages and permission will be given for residential areas in 1,600 hectares located outside notified area of the capital.

These villages are Koba, Adalaj, Shertha, Pethapur, Chiloda, Kolvada and Vavol. In addition to this, commercial activities would be developed on both sides of the Gandhinagar-Koba Circle Road for which 250 hectare of land has been earmarked.

The minister said that the government has decided to set up non-polluting units, including readymade garment and jewellery park, in the vicinity of industrial area falling under the limits of GIDC estate which has huge unutilised area.

â€œThe commercial sign boards have been banned in the entire notified areas as a part of maintaining beauty of this green city.â€�

As per the provisions of the development plan of Ahmedabad, the urban authorities have imposed ban on construction activities nearer to water bodies as they would adversely affect the ground water sources.

In view of representations made by the government employees, extra construction of stair cases and bath room and toilet would be allowed in the margin area of small plots measuring 90 square meter.

The builders will have to make necessary arrangements for water harvesting system and percolation wells for storage of rain water as has been made compulsory in big cities.

15,Increasing protests in PoK against Islamic studies,"NEW DELHI: The Pakistan-occupied northern areas of Kashmir like Gilgit and Skardu have been witnessing massive protests as the local population, mostly Shias, have resented the imposition of Islamic studies in schools and colleges by the Pakistan government.

At least 15 protesters were seriously injured in police firing in Gilgit recently, intelligence agencies said here on Wednesday.

The incident took place when over 400 students of two newly-established colleges clashed with the police on November 4. They were resisting the order asking them to vacate the Karakuram International University premises. The police first burst teargas shells and then resorted to a baton charge in which 15 students were injured. More than 40 students were arrested under the Maintenance of Public Order.

However, the protests have not died down and unable to control the situation, local administration has deployed 2,500 personnel of the Frontier Constabulary and the Khyber Rifles.

Since June this year, the Shias have been up in arms against the Pakistan governmentâ€™s decision to introduce â€˜â€˜Islamiyat curriculum in educational institutions which ignores their beliefsâ€™â€™, a source said. The situation took a turn for the worse when a mob reportedly tried to close down an army-run school in Gilgit town.

The local administration has already imposed prohibitory orders in the town following the failure of talks between the administration and a Shia group on the issue of introduction of Islamic studies in the school syllabus.

Shias dominate the northern area comprising the five districts of Skardu, Gilgit, Ghizer, Ghanche and Dimer. These areas are inhabited by diverse ethnic groups. Pakistani nationals who have migrated to these areas and settled there, have exploited the natural wealth and hold all positions of power. â€˜â€˜The local people have no political or administrative powers. Even graduates are working as daily wage labourers,â€™â€™ an observer noted.

He said that under direct Pakistani rule, the area has remained backward with no industries, factories or mills. The locals have even protested against the construction of the Karakoram Highway because they say it will only benefit the Punjabi and Pathan Pakistanis.

The Pathans from neighbouring North West Frontier Province (NWFP) have virtually taken over local trade and introduced their own cultural values which have caused serious conflicts in recent years, sources added.

16,"Prince is passe, now a new rape theory","NEW DELHI: Have the Delhi police hit a dead end in the Swiss diplomat rape case investigations?

On Tuesday, they enhanced the cash reward, for a clue, from Rs 50,000 to Rs 4 lakh. On Wednesday, a new theory was floated â€” the accused could be known to the victim.

Senior officials said the police have been trying for a week now to trace a man with whom the victim had long telephone conversations on several occasions.

The fact that the man has been ""untraceable"" has added to the police suspicion, the officials said.

According to a senior police official, it is normal to track people with whom a victim had telephone conversations.

""We are concentrating on two numbers, belonging to two individuals, because of the frequency and length of the calls made from them to the victimâ€™s number,"" he said.

In support of the latest police theory, the official said the appearance of one of the two callers came close to the computer sketch of the main accused. The sketch was made with the help of the victim.

However, there is a fair amount of scepticism within the Delhi Police about the new formulation.

""Earlier they had announced that Mustafabad royal Navdeep Randhawa could be involved in the rape. That theory boomeranged.

""Similarly, they had claimed earlier that the filmmaker who was also assaulted the same day was not cooperating with the police. That has also turned out to be false,"" said another police official.

""If the attacker was known to the victim, why did she not name him?"" said this official. Police officials said photographs of around 30 suspects have been mailed to the victim. The victim, however, has not been able to say with certainty if any of them was involved in the crime.

17,Cong likely to change rally plans,"MUMBAI: Chief minister Sushilkumar Shinde announced here on Wednesday that the Congress party was prepared to either shift the venue or date of party president Sonia Gandhiâ€™s public rally,which is scheduled to be held at Shivaji Park in Mumbai on December 28.

The Mumbai Regional Congress Committee (MRCC) had planned to hold the rally to mobilise public opinion against the BJP-led government at the Centre.

Last week, MRCC president Gurudas Kamat met Ms Gandhi in New Delhi and confirmed the date of the rally. The MRCC paid Rs 600 towards rent and Rs 500 as deposit to the BMC for the maidan.

However, it turns out that an organisation of varkaris (devotees of Lord Vittal of Pandharpur) had applied to the BMC for the maidan before the MRCC had put in its application. Sources in the Congress said the varkaris had not paid the rental and deposit and hence the maidan was allotted to the MRCC.

But, in view of the sensitivity of the issue, Mr Shinde suggested that the MRCC either change the venue or date of its rally. Meanwhile, the MRCC is trying to persuade the leaders of the varkaris to choose a different venue.

Mr Shinde said, â€œMs Gandhi respects the sentiments of the varkaris. Hence, we will not allow any politicisation of this issue. If necessary, we will shift the venue or date of her rally.â€™â€™
