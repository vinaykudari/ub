1,PSHRC unhappy with govt hospitals' attitude,"AMRITSAR: Punjab State Human Rights Commission (PSHRC) has expressed displeasure over the lax attitude of the government towards disposal of bio-medical waste in the three government hospitals of Amritsar.

The commission has directed the Director Research Medical Education (DRME) to look into the matter to ensure that the image of state government is not sullied due to lack of proper arrangements for disposal of bio-medical waste. In contrast, most of the private hospitals have tied up with a private company for effective and scientific disposal of biomedical waste.

HS Gill, medical superintendent of the governmentrun Sri Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital told TNN on Thursday that the contract policy had been forwarded to the concerned department for approval. And after the department''s nod, they would ink the agreement with the private company. As per the contract, Rs 3 per day per bed would be paid to the company for the government medical hospital at Patiala and Rs 3.50 per day per bed for Amritsar and Faridkot hospitals.

Out of total number of 70 hospitals and nursing homes in Amritsar, 55 have a tie-up with private company of Ludhiana for disposal of biomedical waste. Of the remaining 15, seven have recently gone for the option, while two units have closed down. The remaining three units are government hospitals, and are in the process of initiating a tie-up.

Two MC managed hospitals have also initiated proceedings for linking up for this. Lal Devi Hospital, which is managed by private trust, has also been advised by the MC to tie-up with the company.

The PSHRC has lauded the efforts made by the local administration for facilitating proper management of biomedical waste being generated by hospitals and nursing homes. The commission has also advised the MC to ensure that the two hospitals managed by it do not lag in this.

Terming the issue as one of vital importance, the commission have also asked the Commissioner Jalandhar division to visit Amritsar and submit his evaluation report on the progress made by local hospitals and nursing homes towards scientific disposal of bio-medical waste.

2,SC to TN govt: Cannot stop paying pension,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday asked the Tamil Nadu government not to withhold payment of pension to its employees, who went on strike and were reinstated. It also fixed August 5 for hearing the Jayalalithaa governmentâ€™s dispassionate decision on 30,000 employees, who had not been reinstated.

A Bench of Justices M B Shah and A R Lakshmanan reiterated that the employees had no legal, fundamental or equitable right to go on strike. The court also ridiculed the employees for resorting to strike and held the society at large to ransom.

â€˜â€˜It has become rampant, may be for social or political reasons, to go on bandhs affecting normal life. If on occasions when strict action is taken, and the courts keep intervening to show mercy, the problem keeps repeating,â€™â€™ the Bench said.

3,Man arrested for selling fake marksheets,"CHANDIGARH: Close on the heels of busting a racket of increasing marks by tempering with the answer sheets operations cell of city police has busted a racket where one could get degrees by just paying money.

Police arrested, Rajiv Kumar, who was running one such ''education shop'' promising top arrange degree of CBSE for class X and XII. The accused ran a non-descript shop by the name of Suvidha Educational Assistance Service, in sector 22 and also owned a eatery in Mohali.

The racket was busted when a youth, Jaspreet, also a resident of Mohali went to Rajiv for guidance for doing class X. Rajeev promised him that Jaspreet has just to sit in the CBSE exams and not even write anything in the answer sheets. Jaspreet paid him Rs 15,000.

However, when CBSE exams started, Jaspreet was not even asked to appear in any centre, that Rajeev told him that he has already procured a degree from him.

The class X degree belonged to CBHE (central board of higher education) instead of CBSE. Jaspreet then approached police.

After investigation police found that that CBHE was a fake board and operated from some corner of Delhi. After Rajeev''s interrogation he spilled the beans saying that this business flourished in big way in Ambala and Delhi. Though, till now, police has recovered one mark sheet and one degree, police is hopeful that the racket would turn out to be of much bigger scale.

Rajeev was produced in courts on Thursday and has been remanded to five day police custody. Police parties will be sent to Delhi and Ambala on Friday to trace more such degree and seize them.

Last month, operations cell has busted a racket where-in some persons employed for putting up fictitious roll numbers on answer sheets of class x and XII of CBSE, smuggled them out where then students could rewrite it. Seven persons were arrested in this racket. After analysis of suspected answer sheet it was detected that some 24 students have tempered with them. The second report is awaited in this case, before action is also taken against the students, who paid money to temper with the answer sheets.

4,Film-makers miffed about censorship rule,"MUMBAI: The announcement for the Mumbai International Film Festival (MIFF) declares that â€œhappy days are here againâ€™â€™. But behind the bluster lies an unpleasant surprise: For the first time in its 13-year history, the festival is insisting that participating films require censorship clearance.

This unexpected clause has generated alarm within the documentary-film fraternity, which sees it as an attempt to stifle freedom of expression. â€œAll over the world, film festivals are outside the purview of censorship,â€™â€™ said filmmaker Sanjay Kak,who has started a signature campaign in protest.

Added film-maker Rakesh Sharma, â€œMy last film, â€˜Aftershocksâ€™,was entered in 70-odd film festivals around the world, but the question of censorship didnâ€™t come up even once.â€™â€™

So why, after seven censor-free rounds of MIFF, are the dreaded scissors looming over the festival to be held in February 2004? Many suspect that this is not an isolated instance, but part of an ominous pattern.

Earlier this year, the censor board refused to clear â€˜Aakroshâ€™, a documentary on the Gujarat carnage, on the grounds that it â€œdepicts violence, reminds of the riots and shows the government and police in bad lightâ€™â€™.

Similarly, Anand Patwardhan was thrust into a prolonged battle with the censor board last year over â€˜War and Peaceâ€™, which addresses issues surrounding nuclear war.

â€œAs equipment becomes more accessible and young people join the field, documentaries are becoming a space for independent voices,â€™â€™ said Anjali Monteiro of the Unit of Media and Communication at Tata Institute of Social Sciences.

Added Bishakha Datta, who has spent a year tangling with the censor board over her documentary on commercial sex workers, â€œEarlier, if a screening was at some small venue, nobody bothered about the censor certificate. But today the censor board actually writes to the theatre and demands explanations.

""This is part of a larger attempt to control thinking and clamp down on diverse ideasâ€”the same process that has resulted in the revision of school curricula and scrutiny of international scholars visiting India for conferences.â€™â€™

Is MIFF is the latest victim of this paranoia? Films Division maintains that a censor certificate merely helps it to establish the date of completion of the film. â€œNobody has protested so far, and I see no reason why they should,â€™â€™ said a Films Division official.

However, the film-makers view the matter differently and point out that to demand censor certificates from Indian but not international films is both discriminatory and pointed.

â€œThe kinds of films being denied censor certificates are invariably those which do not speak highly about the establishment,â€™â€™ said Mr Sharma.

â€œWe have a ridiculous situation where the VHP is free to distribute horrible propaganda materials, but if I use excerpts from those I am certain to be censored.â€™â€™ Moreover, the fear of a sticky censorship situation might well influence upcoming film-makers for whom MIFF is an important forum.

â€œA film festival is a place to be experimental and outrageous, not be governed by the rules of sobriety,â€™â€™ said Mr Kak, pointing out that youngsters might shy away from politically explosive and sexually explicit subjects in order to make to MIFF. â€œMy greatest fear is that this will result in unhealthy selfcensorship, and set limits for the way we think.â€™â€™

A still from Anand Patwardhanâ€™s â€˜War and Peaceâ€™, which ran into trouble with the censors.

7,"Let Gowda talk about farmers, not me: Mallya","BANGALORE: Janata Party national working president Vijay Mallya on Thursday took on former PM H.D. Deve Gowda for criticising him in all his speeches.

Mallya said: â€œIf Gowda thinks I am irrelevant, he should not attack me like this on a daily basis. The fact that he is attacking me means I am relevant and my party is also relevant. As a person who has occupied the highest office in the country, Gowda should talk about farmers and other important issues.â€�

Mallya said he had no animosity against anyone and respected leaders from all parties. â€œThere may be political differences, but I will not get into mud-slinging. I did attend the funeral of Byre Gowda today.â€™â€™

On his relationship with senior JD leader Ramakrishna Hegde, Mallya said he was like a father to him. â€œI donâ€™t meet Hegde only to discuss politics. After my father expired, he is like a father to me. It is like a relative calling on a relative. In fact, after the crash, Hegde called me. He cares for me. It is not political. It is human. Several parties are competing to seek Hegdeâ€™s blessings. When I go to someone for blessings, I donâ€™t tell him not to bless the person behind me. I always wish good luck for everyone. Only after seeking Hegdeâ€™s blessings, I pursued my political path.â€™â€™

Reiterating his commitment to bring in a â€œchangeâ€™â€™, he said: â€œWhen my father died, people worried about the future of United Breweries (UB). Today, the results of the company speak for itself. When I take up something, I will pursue it. When Iâ€™ve enjoyed so much success, I donâ€™t want to be a failure.â€™â€™

Inducting DNA Networks chairman and MD T. Venkat Vardhan, who is the grandson of Kengal Hanumanthaiah, Mallya said: â€œWe need young people like him to begin a crusade against non-performance and non-governance. I am aware, that to be in politics is not an easy task. By no means, do I consider it a cakewalk. But I am determined to bring in the change. Venkat and I have the resources to do that.â€™â€™

8,CPM expels 339 party functionaries,"KOLKATA: As many as 339 members of the CPM have been expelled from the party for entering into â€˜unprincipled alliancesâ€™ with other political parties to capture power in the panchayats. More members have been handed milder punishment such as suspension from the party.

Disciplinary action against so many party members on these charges, was unprecedented, CPM state secretary Anil Biswas said.

The largest number of those expelled, 86, are from Coochbehar, followed by East Midnapore at 84. Thirty two were expelled in Birbhum, 12 in Burdwan, 20 in South Dinajpur, 14 in Howrah, 9 in Hooghly, 10 in Jalpaiguri, 7 in Nadia, 15 in West Midnapore and 12 in North 24-Parganas.

Biswas refused to comment when he asked whether violation of party instructions to grab power was the result of the weakening ideological grip of the CPM over its activists. â€œThis is for you to interpret,â€� he said.

9,Ayyo! Raga pop rules the charts,"LOS ANGELES: Vocalist Susheela Raman wears her Indian influences like a silken shawl. And it shows in her music too.Love Trap â€” which shot to the No. spot on CMJâ€™s world music charts last week â€” is probably the only pop album ever to feature tracks from two members of the â€œtrinity of Carnatic musicâ€�, Tyagaraja and Dikshitar.â€œWhat is really important to me is the sentiment with which these Carnatic songs are written,â€� Raman told India-West last week by phone from New York. â€œI try to stick to the essence of what the song means and how to be able to translate that.â€�Raman was born in London to Tamil parents, and moved with them to Australia when she was very young. Her mother, a music aficionado, ensured that the sounds of classical south Indian music and Hindi film songs were always in the air. Raman began her singing career giving recitals at an early age, and branched out into blues-based music as a teenager.â€œI was about 13 when I discovered Aretha Franklin and Anita Baker. Billie Holiday was a real revelation,â€� she told Rhythm magazine. When she formed a funk and soul band at the age of 16, she said, â€œI really threw myself into it and cut myself off completely from the Indian music I grew up with. My parents were tearing their hair out!â€�But at the age of 20, she went to India on a journey of self-discovery that reawakened her love of Indian music. Visiting a music festival in Varanasi, she fell in love with the voice of Hindustani vocalist Shruti Sadolikar, and returned to India in 1995 to study with her in earnest.Love Trap touches on a wide range of styles, all made distinctive by Ramanâ€™s smoky alto marked by throaty Carnatic-infused melismas; while guest artistes such as a Tuvan throat singer, a Hawaiian guitarist and a Nigerian drummer add surprising elements.A few of the songs are in English, including the title track, but most of the material is influenced by Indian sounds and is sung in Sanskrit and Telugu. Sakhi Maro is based on a Meerabai bhajan in Marathi, Manusoloni, adapted from a Tyagaraja composition, blends Afrobeat with drum â€˜nâ€™ bass.Two compositions by Dikshitar, Dhamavati and Bliss, use flamenco piano technique; and Raman even throws in a Hindi film song, Ye Mera Deewanapan Hai, written by Shanker-Jaikishan and made popular by Mukesh in the 1950s Dilip Kumar film, Yehudi.Ramanâ€™s pronunciation and sensuous phrasing on Yeh Mera will appeal to the world music lounge listener, but may leave the filmi purist camp nonplussed. Sheâ€™s fluent in Tamil but â€œI donâ€™t speak Hindi at allâ€�, she explained.â€œI know that song, and itâ€™s very sentimental for me, because itâ€™s a very romantic song that my parents played a lot when I was a kid. Itâ€™s a beautiful melody with very beautiful lyrics and I felt I really wanted to do it. â€œThe pronunciation is not entirely perfect, but the essence is there!â€�",LOS ANGELES
10,Rail settlers block trains to protest ouster,"KOLKATA: Hundreds of settlers living beside railway tracks between Ballygunge and Tollygunge stations on the Sealdah south section blocked trains on Thursday in protest against the move to evict them.

The Supreme Court has recently upheld the Eastern Railwayâ€™s plea for eviction of encroachers on its land.

The blockades took place near Dhakuria, Tollygunge and Lake Gardens stations around 11 am. Various organisations of the settlers, aided by Opposition political parties such as the Trinamul Congress and the SUCI, aided the agitators, along with activist groups like the Uchchhed Birodhi Jukta Mancha. Many women participated in the sit-in.

Despite a strong presence of government railway police personnel including a large number of women police, the demonstrators stayed on the tracks for some time, before being dispersing peacefully.

â€œEight Down and 5 Up trains were detained for more than halfan-hour due to the blockade. Six other trains had to be cancelled,â€� said a senior Eastern Railway official.

Trinamul Congress MLA Saugata Roy later said that evicting the people who had been living beside the tracks without rehabilitation was a violation of human rights. â€œThe railways should co-ordinate with the Centre and arrange rehabilitation under the Ambedkar-Valmiki Yojna,â€� he said.

11,NGOs to rally villagers against uranium plant,"HYDERABAD: With mining of uranium likely to begin shortly in Lambapur and Peddagutta villages near Nalgonda, several NGOs in the city as well as in the districts have begun the task of mobilising public opinion against the project.

The public hearing on the Uranium Corporation of India Limitedâ€™s (UCIL) plan to set up a uranium mining plant would be taken up on August 19. The Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) prepared by UCIL would be presented to the public on August 19 to seek their opinion.

NGOs like Samriti, Environment Protection Council, Centre for Resource Education, Citizens Against Pollution, and Mines Minerals and People are already camping in the area to increase awareness among the villagers about the possible side-effects. A documentary depicting the effects of a similar uranium plant in Jaduguda, Bihar, would also be shown.

â€œThe EIA says that the radiation will be minimal and constantly monitored, but they do not have any concrete action plan as to how they would minimise the radiation,â€� Narasimha Reddy of the Centre for Resource Education said.

As the proposed plant is close to Nagarjuna Sagar reservoir, the effect of radiation, if any, would not only affect the local population but people residing in a much bigger area, he said. â€œThe run-off water from the mine and surrounding areas will seep into the reservoir and finally find its way to the city,â€� Reddy said. The Akkampally reservoir is only 14 km from the proposed mining fields, he said.

12,US report pans India's domestic unrest,"NEW DELHI: Though President George W Bush has been busy implementing a radically new and big idea on Indo-US relations, there are indicators that the perceptions and expectations of top United States and Indian leaders are ""divergent on several key issues"".

According to US Congressional report, released on Thursday, the US has serious reservations over key issues like ""domestic unrest"", New Delhi''s role in the Persian Gulf and Central Asia and a potential US role in resolving the India-Pakistan dispute.

The brief on Indo-US relations to the US Congress, prepared by the Congressional Research Service, underscores a number of negative factors that undermine the otherwise optimistic picture of bilateral ties.

""Throughout the 1990s, regional rivalries, separatist tendencies and sectarian tensions continued to divert India''s attention and resources from economic and social development,"" the report says as quoted by the Associated Press of Pakistan from Washington.

On the political front, the report referred to the Gujarat elections and said the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ""rode a crest of rising Hindu Nationalism."" APP quoted the report as saying that ""Gujarat chief minister and BJP leader Narendra Modi called for early elections"" in an effort to take advantage of a polarized political setting, some say, he had a campaign that emphasized ""a perceived Islamic/Pakistani threat to the countryâ€™s and stateâ€™s Hindu Majority"".

The report observed Gujarat was the ""site of horrific communal conflict"" in 2002, which killed more than 2,000 people, mostly Muslims.

The report also said, ""Popular among upper caste groups, the party continues to be looked upon with suspicion by lower caste Indians, Indiaâ€™s 140 million Muslims, and non-Hindi-speaking Hindus in southern India, who together comprise a majority of Indiaâ€™s voters.""

In Kashmir, the report alleged, ""Many Kashmiris were moved to support newly-established military separatist groups after several incidents in which Indian troops fired on demonstrators.""

During the recent state elections in Kashmir, the report claimed that the ""voter turnout remained low, although many voters were herded to polling stations by security forces"".

The report also presented a dismal picture of the human rights situation in India. Human rights violation, it said, include ""extensive societal violence against women; extra judicial killings, faked encounter killings, excessive use of force by security forces, arbitrary arrests and incommunicado detentions in Kashmir and several northeastern states"".

The report quoted the US State Department as saying that ""many of these abuses are generated by a traditionally hierarchical social structure, deeply rooted tensions among the country''s many ethnic and religious communities, violent secessionist movements and the authorities'' attempts to repress them, and deficient police methods and training.""

At the same time, the report said, the United States lauds Pakistanâ€™s participation as a key ally in the US-led counterterrorism coalition.

The CRS brief of the Library of Congress is for the information of US Senators and Congressmen.

India has close relations with countries like Iran, Oman and Qatar in the Persian Gulf as peace and security in the region remain of great importance to India. Security of the Persian Gulf is vital for India in view of its relations with Central Asian States as India''s strategic concerns are tied up with the regions bordering its north and northwest.

After all, said Pant, decisions had to be implemented. ""The Prime Minister is concerned with the entire government... the idea behind the agenda is to see nothing is lost sight of to keep the spotlight on the process.""

14,Lesotho keen on Indian investments,"MUMBAI: Lesotho, a small mountainous country, totally surrounded by South Africa, is emerging as one of the most favoured investment destinations in the world with Taiwan and Hong Kong taking lead as the first batch of investing countries, said His Excellency Prime Minister of Lesotho, Pakalitha Bethuel Mosisili.

Earlier, in his welcome address, Vijay G.Kalantri, President, All India Association of Industries, said Indian industry has world-class technology in diverse fields and it has a vibrant and dynamic small sector. By setting up units in Lesotho, Indian manufacturers can get easy access to the African market as well as to the developed countries of EU, the US and Canada.

Addressing an Indian business meeting arranged by All India Association of Industries, Mosisili said although Lesotho is a small country it has concessionary market access to 50 million consumers in the South African Customs Union, 400 million consumers in the European Union and also to the United States of America through Africa Growth and Opportunity Act.

Recently a similar arrangement has been chalked out with Canada through a memorandum of understanding (MoU) providing for duty and quota-free access to all Lesotho-made products. Besides, a highly concessionary generalised system of preferences (GSP) also exists for made-in-Lesotho products to Japanese, Nordic and other developed countries.

The Prime Minister said that the Lesotho business fraternity is looking forward to several business ventures with India industry including harnessing Lesotho''s most valued asset - water, expansion of industrial base to include fully integrated textiles, assembly of consumer electronics and household appliances, strategic commercial services such as information technology, financial services, electronic commerce and smart cards, setting up of agro industries, development of eco-tourism based on Lesotho''s pristine beauty and last but not the least diamond mining.

The Lesotho government is deeply committed to privatisation and Indian companies have ample opportunities in power and telecom sectors.

While easy market access to rich nations has lubricated flow of foreign investments to Lesotho, foreign investments to the country has already been made more attractive by a low corporate tax of 15 per cent on profits earned by manufacturing companies and free repatriation of profits.

There is no withholding tax on dividends distributed by manufacturing companies to local or foreign shareholders, liberal export finance facility, unimpeded access to foreign exchange and provision of serviced industrial sites and factory for rental at competitive rates.

In addition to these incentives, Lesotho government has strong commitment to the rule of law and the country''s trade policy regime is based on internationally agreed norms. The country is also a signatory to the convention on the settlement of investment disputes between States and nationals of other States and a member of the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA).

The pro-industry policy of the Lesotho government has received a shot-in-the-arm by the young and abundant, predominantly English-speaking, literate and well-motivated labour force of the country with a tradition of manual dexterity at competitive wage rates.

15,"Control prices of life-saving drugs, govt told","NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday criticised the Centre for not including several life-saving drugs in the essential medicines list and said it would not allow the drug price control order (DPCO) under the Pharmaceutical Policy 2002 to operate unless certain crucial medicines used by the poor as well were also covered by the price order.

""India is a welfare state. You should see to the welfare of all the people and not that of the rich. Life-saving drugs should be included. We will monitor the case till it is done,"" a Bench of Chief Justice V N Khare and Justice S B Sinha said.

On July 11 the government had informed the court about inclusion of 75 new drugs to the essential medicines list.

When it was pointed out that several important drugs for treatment of typhoid, Hepatitis A and cardiac diseases have not been included in the essential medicines list, the Bench ridiculed the Central government for taking different stands at different points of time.

Objecting to linking the issue of inclusion of a medicine to the turnover of a company manufacturing the same, the Bench asked: ""what is this - if the price goes up and the turnover increases, the medicine will go out of the list?""

Brushing aside explanations offered by additional solicitor general Raju Ramachandran, the Bench said: ""We were given to understand by Attorney General Soli J Sorabjee that apart from the existing medicines, many more would be added to the essential drugs list"".

It further said, ""if proper steps are not taken by the government, we will pass a judicial order.""

The court granted four weeks'' time to the Centre file a proper affidavit regarding its final stand on the price control policy.

The court was hearing the Centre''s appeal challenging a Karnataka High Court order that virtually stayed the DPCO and directed the government to include life-saving drugs in the list of essential medicines.

The high court had passed the order on a public interest litigation filed by one K S Gopinath alleging that if the DPCO was implemented the prices of the drugs would be hiked on the whims and fancies of the manufacturers.

Ramachandran contended that the apex court had stayed the High Court order but had asked the government to review the list, which had been done and 75 new drugs had been added. As the needful had been done, he said, the government should be permitted to implement the DPCO.

Gopinath''s counsel C A Sundaram said that the drug manufacturers were interested in immediate implementation as it would give them leverage to take the drugs out of DPCO on the basis of their turnover.

18,Let us appear in courts after 2 pm: Docs to CJI,"NEW DELHI: Doctors in the city seem to be taking their concern for their patientsâ€™ interests to new limits â€” far enough to cover their own first. Close on the heels of its request to the Delhi government to allow doctors to use mobile phones in traffic, the Delhi Medical Association (DMA) has now approached the Chief Justice of India and sought exemption from appearing in courts before 2 pm.

â€˜â€˜The morning hours are crucial for patient-care and most doctors would serve the community better by spending more time in clinics than in courts,â€™â€™ said DMA president Anil Bansal. Doctors, especially those from government hospitals, need to appear in court as witnesses or for giving evidence in criminal cases. Lawyers donâ€™t seem to agree with the doctorsâ€™ prescription for relief from the so-called agony of a long wait in court.

Delhi Bar Council chairman K C Mittal said: â€˜â€˜Such a system cannot work because criminal courts take up remand work after 2 pm and this goes on till 3.30 pm.â€™â€™ â€˜â€˜Courts may take a sympathetic view of a particular doctorâ€™s request. But doctors should refrain from regulating the court system as per their own convenience,â€™â€™ he said. Even the medical fraternity is divided in its opinion over the gains from the proposal.

â€˜â€˜This appears to be the brain- child of private practitioners who lose financially if they are forced to spend time in courts rather than their clinics,â€™â€™ said a government hospital doctor.

Recently, the DMA had said that doctors should be exempted from the Rs 1,000 fine charged for talking on a cellphone while driving. The DMAâ€™s logic was that doctors often got emergency calls that needed to be attended to immediately, even while driving.

Police sources said on-spot verification has proved that only one library exists instead of the five. The FIR against the four accused, filed by H B Patel of government-run Science College in Gandhinagar, also mentions that they failed to supply supporting documents for miscellaneous expenditures.

The accused had not only spent the grant for miscellaneous activities but also incurred an overdraft in the account. Two offices in the college premises had been rented out to the telecom department and Punjab National Bank.

â€œInvestigations have revealed that the rent collected every month from these organisations by the college authorities was never paid to the University as per norms. We will seek remand of the four persons arrested in this regard,â€� said ACP Jadav.
