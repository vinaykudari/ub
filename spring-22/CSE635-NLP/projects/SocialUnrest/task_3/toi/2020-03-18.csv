0,Police arrest two after armed encounter,"SAHNEWAL: The small village of Sahnewal on the outskirts of Ludhiana once again was the venue of another armed encounter between police and smugglers, suspected of having links with Pakistanâ€™s ISI.

Two of the suspects have been arrested, while the third identified as Kashmir Singh of Burel village near Chandigarh, escaped in a Tata Indica car. Two kg of heroin, a .32 pistol, Rs 20,000 in counterfeit currency notes and Rs 40,000 in cash has also been recovered from them.

The arrested suspects have been identified as Sukhvir Singh and Amolakh Singh, from Bhurj Sarain village and Thathina village of Amritsar district, respectively.

SSP Harpreet Singh Sidhu told Times News Network that this encounter was not linked to the one which took place on March 8.

Interestingly, the SSP said more than once that the incident actually took place and the same could be verified by questioning passers-by. The scene of action was near Sahne Khurd village on GT road, a couple of kilometres from Sahnewal police station.

The SSP told Times News Network that police, on Tuesday, had received information about the exchange of drugs and money after which DSP Snehdeep Sharma was deputed to lead the operation. Sukhvir and Kashmir had come from Sahnewal side and were headed for Ludhiana. Kashmir was sitting inside the car while Sukhvir was handing over the heroin to Amolakh who was standing nearly 200 yards away.

This is when the police swung into action and arrested Amolakh who was unarmed, police said. Sukhvir, on the other hand, police sources claim, had already started firing shots at the police. In the meantime, police claim, Kashmir reversed his car towards Sukhvir when he was caught by the DSP from behind.

Sharmaâ€™s bodyguard â€” Bhupinder Singh â€” tried to stop Kashmir who shot at him in an effort to get away. The bullet grazed the bodyguardâ€™s forehead who is presently being treated at the civil hospital, Sahnewal.

The police operation was conducted by ten policemen. The cross-fire continued for several minutes, police claim, with the DSP firing six rounds and Sukhvir firing nearly ten.

1,Left lingo on globalisation floods farmers' crusade,"JALANDHAR: The recently concluded All-India Kisan Sabha Conference generated a lot of debate on the issue of globalisation and WTO on which governments at the Centre and in Punjab have kept mum for a long time now.

Kisan activists from across the country called a spade a spade and voiced some harsh truths about the national and international fallout of globalisation. The language of the Left invaded the city after a long gap as peasant comrades dissected and analysed the â€˜â€˜imperialist designs'''' in choice vocabulary. Farmers'' leaders exposed the pernicious agenda of globalistion with a mixture of homespun wit and sophisticated arguments.

The approach paper of the conference said: â€˜â€˜Fidel Castro, Cuban President and world-renowned Communist revolutionary leader, gave a simple but highly accurate description of globalisation. Globalisation, he said, was nothing but a conspiracy of the imperialist countries to turn our countries into their private property. It is the new strategy of imperialism to impose its economic, political, cultural and military hegemony over the whole world in general, and to carry out the unlimited loot and exploitation of the developing countries in particular.''''

Seeing the imminent attack on Iraq as the beginning of the new agenda of globalisation, the following argument was thrown up: â€˜â€˜The World Bank, the international Monetary Fund, the World Trade Organisation, powerful multinational corporations and its military prowess are the five main weapons in the new imperialist strategy. The main objective of globalisation is to establish its uncontrolled monopoly over the world market, natural resources, science and technology, communications and media and weapons of mass destruction. The aggressive war drive of American imperialism against Iraq to gain control over its vast oil resources is its latest vivid example.''''

Yet another argument thrown up during the conclave sought to trace the genesis of the problem and the ramifications of globalisation on other countries. Eschewing all academic circumlocution, it unfolded like this: â€˜â€˜The onslaught of imperialist globalisation began in the Eighties. It first made Latin American countries like Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Peru its targets, since these countries were directly in the American sphere of influence. In the Nineties, this phenomenon spread rapidly to several developing countries in Asia and Africa. The signing of the GATT agreement and the establishment of the World Trade Organisation in 1995 was a decisive milestone in the globalisation process.''''

Taking a direct hit at the BJP-led NDA government, the dhoti-clad, unassuming leaders of the country''s peasantry thundered: â€˜â€˜The BJP-led government which came to power in 1998 greatly speeded up the implementation of the LPG policies, which were introduced by the earlier Congress regime under pressure from the IMF-WB duo. Among several other disastrous decisions it began the disinvestment of even profit-making public sector enterprises like BALCO, VSNL, IPCL, HPCL and BPCL at throwaway prices. It gave tremendous concessions to both foreign and domestic monopoly capital; it removed all quantitative restrictions on the import of agricultural produce and industrial goods; it virtually destroyed the public distribution system; and it slashed subsidies for agriculture and for social welfare.''''

2,Arrest of Holi revellers sparks off protests in UP,"LUCKNOW: Police resorted to lathicharge to disperse mobs which surrounded two police stations in Moradabad and Jaunpur districts in Uttar Pradesh and indulged in stone pelting damaging vehicles during a protest against the arrest of some Holi revellers, a police headquarter spokesman said Tuesday.

The trouble sparked off in Sambhal in Moradabad district when police arrested some Holi revellers while they were taking out procession late on Monday night, he said.

Agitated over their arrest, a mob of about 500 people laid siege to the police station and indulged in heavy brickbatting, the spokesman said, adding some police vehicles were damaged and some police personnel sustained injuries.

3,"4,000 preventive arrests made on Holi","KOLKATA: The festival of colours was celebrated across West Bengal with gusto even as 4,000 persons were taken into preventive custody by the police.

4,"Private buses, trucks to go on strike","PUNE: Trucks, tempos and tankers; involved in the transport of LPG, petrol, milk, vegetables and other essential commodities; and private buses will go on a nation-wide indefinite strike from April 14 in protest against cess on petrol and diesel and in support of long-pending demands.

The strike, which was to begin on April 1, was postponed to April 14 to enable the All-India Motor Transport Congress (AIMTC) to give a 30-day notice to the government, said Baba Dhumal, president of the AIMTC. The congress has 40 lakh members across 30 states.

Speaking to TNN here on Tuesday, Dhumal said the transport industry has been in a bad shape for the last four years. This was evident from the 11 per cent fall in diesel consumption last year as compared to 2001.

Diesel constituted 68 per cent of the operating cost and the frequent hikes in diesel prices have added to the cost,while freight rates have remained unchanged, he said.

Listing the demands raised by the AIMTC, Dhumal said the government should withdraw the cess on diesel and regulate excise and custom duty in order to bring stability in diesel prices and transparency in price-fixing.

â€œIf the government cannot do it, they should fix minimum freight for trucks as they do for taxi and rickshaws,â€� he added. Dhumal pointed out that insurance companies were openly flouting guidelines by refusing to underwrite eight to 15 years old commercial vehicles and overloading third party premium by more than 100 per cent.

The AIMTC also demanded abolition of toll, stating that its members already paid road tax and diesel cess. The escort fee on highways should also be withdrawn, it said. Dhumal has pressed for immediate implementation of section 114 of the Motor Vehicle Act of 1988 to check overloading and scrapping of the golden token scheme started by states such as UP, Rajasthan, MP, Orissa and Gujarat, which led to â€œcorruptionâ€�.

The AIMTC has opposed scrapping of old vehicles, saying if there should be a national policy on replacement of old vehicles by giving concession in excise duty, sales tax and interest-free loans.

5,Foreign investment in TV channels capped to 26 pc,"New Delhi: In a setback to Star TV''s proposed 24-hour news channel, the government tonight fixed a cap of 26 per cent on foreign investment in Television news channels seeking to uplink from India.

It asked existing news channels having foreign equity like ZEE News to disinvest within a year to fit into the foreign investment limit of 26 per cent.

Briefing reporters after a meeting of the Union cabinet which fixed the cap, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj said foreign investment in news channels includes Foreign Direct Investment, Foreign Institutional Investment, External Commercial Borrowings and investment by NRIs.

However, for entertaiment channels there will be no cap as they could have 100 per cent foreign investment under the existing policy, Swaraj said.

At the same time, entertainment channels having news bulletins or current affairs programmes would fall under the 26 per cent cap, she said.

Star TV, which was the first wholly-owned foreign channel to request for uplinking from India for a news channel, will now have to apply afresh. After Star TV, which is to launch its news channel on April 1, similar requests were made by BBC and CNBC.

6,Centre asks J&K to review anti-militancy policy,"JAMMU: Stung by recent terrorist attacks in Jammu and Kashmir, Centre has asked the state government to take a fresh look on its policies and approach to deal with militancy.

7,Meghalaya govt ready for talks with militants: Jacob,"SHILLONG: Meghalaya Governor M M Jacob on Wednesday said that the government had kept the door open for dialogue with militants in the state to address their genuine grievances and problems.

Addressing the first budget session of the newly-formed Meghalaya Democratic Alliance (MDA) government headed by D D Lapang, the Speaker said that the government was committed to maintaining law and order and tackling problems posed by the banned militant outfits in the state.

The Centre would be asked for more central paramilitary forces to assist the state police in counter-insurgency insurgency and restoring the confidence of the people in the affected areas, he said.

The police force would be further strengthened and provided with better arms, communication and training facilities under the modernisation scheme, Jacob said.

He said that during the last one year the law and order situation in the state was largely peaceful unaffected by the communal incidents in other parts of the country and congratulated the people for maintaining peace and communal harmony.

However, the militant organisations were active in different parts of the state and insurgency-related crimes like armed robery, dacoity, extortion, kidnapping for ransom and murder were continuting.

In order to check infiltration of foreign nationals into the state, Jacob said that the Centre would be moved to extend the multi-purpose identity cards to Meghalaya also.

Steps would also be taken with the Centre for proper deployment of BSF along the Indo-Bangladesh border to prevent infiltration and cross border movements of militants and terrorits, he said.

Promising a clean transparent and efficient public service, he said that there had been serious allegation of corruption in the government during the last few years and assured that steps would be taken to strengthen vigilance to deal with such matters effectively.

He said, a new centrally sponsored scheme for strengthening and improving the security system in jails would be implemented. Civil defence and home guards would be sensitised to maintain the required level of preparedness in meeting unforseen natural calamities.

The approved outlay for the 10th five year plan of Meghalaya was Rs 3009.00 crore and the approved outlay for the current year''s annual plan is Rs 545 crore. The proposed outlay for the annual plan 2003-04 is Rs 605.00 crore.

The priority areas of the state government for the current year would be agriculture and allied services, including irrigation, rural development, road communication, education, health and water supply, the power sector and the industries sector.

Centrally sponsored schemes, namely Swarn Jayanti Gram Swarozgar Yojana, Sampoorna Gram Samridhi Yojana, Indira Awaas Yojana and National Social Assianstance Programme were being implemented to eradicate poverty in the rural areas, he added. PTI

8,Mamata rejects BJP advice on panchayat polls,"KOLKATA: Trinamool Congress chairperson Mamata Banerjee does not intend to accept the BJP leaders''plea to regard both the Congress and the CPI(M) as political adversaries in the coming panchayat polls in West Bengal.

On the contrary, she intends to have unofficial seat adjustments with the Congress to avert multi-cornered contests and ensure the ruling Marxists'' defeat in as many panchayats as possible.

She has already directed her party functionaries to initiate an unofficial dialogue with the Congress at the district level before finalising the list of nominees for the three-tier panchayat elections scheduled for May.

Mamata feels finalisation of the list of candidates at the earliest will help her launch a vigorous poll campaign targeting the CPI(M)''s ""corruption and misrule.""

The BJP leaders, including party president Venkaiah Naidu, who addressed a trainining camp of party workers here last week, wanted the Trinamool Congress-BJPs combine to target the ruling Marxists as well as the Congress as their common political enemy in the panchayat elections.

Naidu, in particular, felt the Trinamool Congress should not have any illusion about the ""pro-CPI(M) character"" of the Congress and must not go for any direct or indirect electoral entente with the party under any circumstances.

The Trinamool Congress chairperson, who has already cemented her party''s alliance with the BJP, however, has no intention to give up her move to have a ""Mahajot"" or ""grand alliance"" of all anti-

CPI(M) forces, including the Congress, in the panchayat polls. Unlike the BJP leaders, Ms Banerjee does not consider the Congress as her party''s political enemy in West Bengal and has been stressing the need for joining hands with the party as well as some major Left Front partners like the RSP, Forward Bloc and the CPI to isolate and defeat the Marxists.

The Trinamool Congress legislature party''s floor co-ordination with the Congress MLAs inside the state Assembly clearly indicates that the two parties will not mind an unofficial understanding at the block level to put up common candidates against the CPI(M) nominees in the May panchayat polls.

There is, of course, complete unanimity among the Congress, Trinamool Congress and the BJP over the main issues in the panchayat elections.

Besides corruption in the CPI(M)-controlled panchayat bodies, the recent rape cases involving CPI(M) functionaries in different districts will be a major election plank of all the three parties.

The Trinamool Congress-BJP combine intends to exploit the CPI(M)''s current predicament over the rape incidents following the arrest of party functionaries in connection with the specific cases.

State CPI(M) secretary Anil Biswas'' initial denial of the party workers'' involvement in the shameful incidents and chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee''s subsequent admission about the same have naturally prompted the opposition parties to launch a no-

holds-bar campaign against the Marxists, holding them solely responsible for the ""current sense of insecurity among the womenfolk in rural Bengal.""

One of the factors, which has come in handy for the mainline opposition parties to attack the Marxists over the rape incidents, is the critical stand adopted by other major Left Front constituents on the issue.

This is the first time that the RSP, Forward Bloc and the CPI have publicly criticised the ""big brother"" for the latter''s failure to rein in errant party cadres engaged in criminal activities including assaults on women.

The rape of a member of Ganatantrik Mahila Samiti, CPI(M)''s women''s wing, at Gokshadanga in Cooch Behar and the wife of an RSP functionary at Gosaba in South 24 Parganas and the subsequent arrest of some CPI(M) workers in connection with the ghastly incidents have naturally evoked the Left Front partners'' indignation and forced the Marxists to be on the defensive.

The CPI(M) is also worried about the erosion of its public image at the national level in the wake of the rape incidents. The Marxists, who had been quite vocal against the BJP over the gang-

rapes in Gujarat during the recent communal violence, do not have any credible explanation for the involvement of party workers in similar incidents in their stronghold.

Trinamool Congress and the BJP''s combined criticism of the CPI(M) in the Lok Sabha over the gang-rape incidents has made the Marxists'' position all the more vulnerable.

Anil Biswas, state CPI(M) secretary and politburo member, has tried to put up a brave front in the wake of severe criticism from different quarters, saying the party expelled about three hundred members last year for their involvement in ""corrupt practices and unlawful activities.""

Opposition parties, however, believe that the expulsion has no bearing on the present crime scenario in Bengal since ""real culprits have been left untouched as they help the ruling party win elections through unfair means.""

10,Reverse racial lawsuit against Sun Micro,"WASHINGTON: Sun Microsystems is faced by a lawsuit alleging it practices discriminatory policies by replacing older American employees with younger and lower paid Indians.

Sun Microsystems was co-founded by Indian-born Vinod Khosla.

Walter Kruz, 52, who worked in Sun from May 2000 as a software engineer manager filed a lawsuit charging the company with violating age and race discrimination laws by replacing 2,500 American workers and sought compensation for lost wages, attorney''s fees and unspecified punitive damages.

Kruz''s suit, filed in Superior Court in Santa Clara County, California, seeks class action status on behalf of all ""non-East Indian"" employees that were affected by Sun''s workforce reduction policies.

The suit alleged that ""ultimately, Sun''s scheme was successful, allowing it to keep certain positions filled while dramatically reducing its labour costs. Sun''s preference for Indian visa holders in its Reduction in Force selection process discriminated against workers of other races and national origin as well as against workers over age of 40"".

Claiming that preference for Indian workers was ""an extricable part of its corporate culture, it cited a 60 Minutes interview on CBS with Khosla, now a partner at venture capital firm at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, saying Indians are ""favoured over almost anybody else.""

James Caputo, an attorney representing Kruz, estimates the class could encompass as many as 2,400 former Sun workers.

Sun spokeswoman Diane Carlini said the company had not yet seen the suit and added that Khosla''s quotes were taken out of context. Khosla, no longer an employee, did not influence policy on hiring, she added.

Spokeswoman Carlini also said that Sun was cleared of similar charges that its H1-B practices violated labour laws.

""It seems similar to what we''ve seen in the past where we have been cleared,"" she said.

Although its not illegal to hire or retain H- 1B visas in lieu of American workers, employers must pay the ""prevailing"" wages for specific jobs in a region and the process could not adversly impact a specific population of workers.

Analysts note that the allegation struck at the heart of an ongoing debate between US technology groups and their high-tech employees over the federal government''s H-1B visa programme, which allows corporations to temporarily import foreign workers.

The visa programme was designed to help US companies find workers with hard-to-find skills but there is growing concern among American workers that the companies are taking advantage of it to merely cut costs.

11,Antony deplores violence during LDF stir,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Kerala Chief Minister A K Antony on Wednesday deplored violence the state had witnessed during the last two days during the LDF-sponsored agitation on Muthanga issue.

""Acutally what happened was a riot and not an agitation,"" he told reporters here after a cabinet meeting.

Antony said it was as unfortunate the LDF which was ruling in about 50 local bodies of the state besides West Bengal and Tripura had allegedly unleashed largescale violence in the state.

Public properties were damaged and for the first time in the history of the state, widespread attack on police stations and families of police personnel also occurred, he said asking the LDF to call off its agitation for a judicial probe into last month''s police action on tribals in Muthanga in Wayanad district.

LDF, he said, was deliberately unleasing violence in the state to tarnish the ""investment climate"" image developed in the state after the success of Global Investors Meet.

Ruling out a judicial probe, he said as the issue has been internationalised by the Opposition, it was better to wait for the report of National Human Rights Commission instead of probing the matter by a retired judge.

The Opposition agitation would be met using strong measures under law, he added.
