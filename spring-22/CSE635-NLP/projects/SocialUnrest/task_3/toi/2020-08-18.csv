0,Amarinder rules out policy on forest cover,"LUDHIANA: Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh strongly feels about replenishing the fast depleting forest cover but thinks differently when it comes to formulate some kind of policy initiative to check the menace.

When asked in the news conference after state-level Van Mahotsva function organised at Guru Nanak Bhawan here on Monday, he dismissed the idea saying there were hardly any forests in Punjab.

Interestingly, Amarinderâ€™s remarks come in light of the fact that the state accounts for just eight per cent of the total forest area in the country.

In his address earlier, the chief minister harped on the crucial local and global bearings of the problem. He stressed on the need to make efforts in this direction while expressing concern over spaces devoid of green cover, particularly in urban areas of the state.

Recalling his tenure as the state agriculture and forest minister, he said though plantation drives were undertaken, they sadly registered no growth of green cover for want of tending them.

Terming the problem as a â€˜man-made crisisâ€™, Amarinder stressed on voluntary efforts in this regard. He advocated planting of traditional trees like neem, kikar instead of poplar which have ceased to be remunerative anymore.

Punjab forest minister Tripat Rajinder Singh Bajwa also rued lack of maintenance of trees planted during government-sponsored plantation drives. He said that a target of planting one crore saplings in the state had been set.

Amarinder expressed his concern citing the existing international scenario where deforestation had caused global warming leading to drastic changes in the weather patterns.

The situation might lead to the point when the coastal areas worldwide could face risk of submergence due to increased inflow of water into oceans causing submergence of coastal areas, he said referring to the expertsâ€™ opinion.

1,"Stem law and order slide, Jois urged","PATNA: Expressing his serious concern over the recent incidents of kidnappings and murders in Patna and the neighbouring areas, Union small scale industries minister Dr C P Thakur on Monday demanded immediate intervention of governor M Rama Jois in the matter.

Thakur, in a letter addressed to the governor, has said that the kidnapping of noted neurosurgeon Dr Ramesh Chandra a few months back, recent murder of Danapur doctor Dr Om Prakash Verma, telephonic threats issued to several doctors and businessmen and the killing of two shopkeepers of Ramkrishna Colony located east of Rajendranagar, Patna, had clearly proved that the law and order had totally collapsed in Patna and the adjoining areas.

5,Engine derails at Chinchwad,"PUNE: A CSM railway engine belonging to the Pune division, which is used in track ballast operations, derailed near the Chinchwad station rail yard at 3.55 pm on Monday.

Although there was no disruption in rail traffic, passengers and senior citizens had a tough time boarding the Pune-Lonavla-Pune local trains between 4 pm and pm because the trains ran on main railway lines.

Danny Thomas, a daily commuter, said some senior citizens found it difficult to board the local trains due to the height between the train doorway and the main tracks.

Pune divisional traffic manager Brijendra Kumar said, â€œWe had to divert some of the Pune-Lonavla-Pune local trains on the main express train lines, near the Chinchwad station. However, we had made arrangements for senior citizens to board the trains. Likewise, we made frequent announcements of the same on the public address system.â€�

The CSM engine was put back on the railway track by 6.16 pm, he added.

6,Kashmir incomplete without Pandits: Pallone,"SILICON VALLEY: Any solution to the Kashmir problem was incomplete without the return of Kashmiri Pandits to the valley and compensation for the losses suffered by the community, US Congressman Frank Pallone has said.

""I feel strongly about Kashmir and the plight of Kashmiri Pandits,"" Pallone said addressing a highly successful fund-raising event organised by local activist and Kashmiri leader Jeevan Zutshi here on Monday.

Pallone, also the co-founder of India Caucus, said the issue of Kashmiri Pandits was not only important to India, but to the very soul of India.

""I think that a day has to come when the Pandits can go back to the valley. I know that is not an easy thing to say. But I think that has to be the litmus test,"" he told an Indian-American gathering, which comprised of a large number of Kashmiri Pandits.

""Whatever happens to the future of Kashmir, there has to be an opportunity for the Pandits to be compensated, to be able to go back for those who want to go back.""

Pallone said he had good relations with the Indian government and took every opportunity to speak out in support of the Kashmiri Pandits.

""I tell them you are not doing enough or you are not chastising the state government for not doing what they are supposed to do. I don''t think that their plight should be politicised, in the sense that New Delhi makes decision based on who they are trying to assuage in Srinagar.""

8,Centuries old profession on verge of extinction,"CHANDIGARH: The centuries old profession of manufacturing of clay idols of Hindu and other mythological characters is slowly dying due to the advent of modern technology in manufacturing of these idols coupled with the indifference attitude of people in buying the clay idols and toys.

Once a prosperous hand made clay toy manufacturing industry of Amritsar has now concentrated to a couple of families only who also manufacture clay idols on the occasion of either Janmashtami , Diwali or such religious festivals.

On the occasion of Janamashtami devotees of Lord Krishna display the events of childhood of Krishna besides takes out tableaux (Jhankiâ€™s) in forms of processions depicting various scenes from the life of Krishna which is one of the intrinsic part of Janamashtami . While the processions continues to be the part of celebrations ,the clay idols of Krishna and others are being replaced with plastic ones.

These skilled artisans who often manufacture toys and idols from their homes are spread over in the streets of Khilonae Wala Bazaar and Lahori Gate. During the festive season all the family members involve themselves in the manufacturing process to earn a little extra and keep the family tradition alive.

One feels strange to find the traditional artisans using modern gadgets like spray guns to paint the clay idols while many of them still adhere to old practice of manufacturing the idols with hands . And they have a reason for the same â€“ few devotees specially demands for hand made clay idols and buy them with more devotion.

Dharam Pal one of the clay idol manufacturer while talking to TNN on Tuesday said that most of the people buys idols of young Krishana and Jhulana (cradle) to recreate the scenes from Krishanaâ€™s infancy . ""There is lot of hardship than returns"" said he adding that they sell their idols for a meager amount of RS 1 while each idol costs around 75 paisa.

Jia Lal another toy manufacturer who has started using modern gadgets in the manufacturing process said that he used them to save time and money. ""I feel a disappointed lot after the buyer doesnâ€™t even hesitate in passing the comments that the clay idols would break in a jiffy- uncaring of the labour and devotion of manufacturer"".

Sant Ram , another manufacturers said that plastic idols and other toys were fast replacing the clay ones so they were suffering a lot on the financial front which was the main reason for closure of many such clay idols manufacturing units.

10,Deadlock over inquiry of Hazare and four ministers continue,"PUNE: The deadlock over the one man inquiry into charges of corruption made against noted anti corruption crusader Anna Hazare and four state ministers continues with former supreme court judge P B Sawant refusing to accept Hazare''s clarification saying that he did not express lack of trust in Sawant.

The anti graft crusader made a special trip to Pune to clear the air with Sawant in the afternoon on Tuesday despite doctor''s advise asking him to rest. He visited Sawant at his residence on Baner road early in the evening to clarify that he had utmost trust in him. ""We had suggested three names, including yours, to the state government to conduct the inquiry. If I had any objections to your appointment as the one man inquiry I would not have ended my indefinite hunger strike"", Hazare appealed.

Hazare further clarified that his statement about not accepting a one man inquiry and not co-operating with the same pertained to the suggestion that the government would choose its own inquiry officer. ""I have experienced how the Puranik committee appointed by the government functioned so I am opposed to accepting an inquiry official of government''s choice"", he explained.

However Sawant said that Hazare''s explanation was not acceptable to him. ""If he does not believe in a one man inquiry committee there is no point in foisting one on Hazare. I too have to consider my self respect and the prestige of the posts held by me earlier"", he stated. Answering a question as to whether he would accept to head the inquiry if the government requested again, Sawant said that the question was irrelevant and speculative.

Hazare later said that he has done his best the explain the matter and now it is upto the government and the people to decide who will head the inquiry.

11,Law Commission wanted change in no-confidence rule,"NEW DELHI: Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani''s suggestion during his speech on the no-confidence motion that the Opposition should have named the alternate Prime Minister stems from the Law Commission''s recommendation that vote of no-confidence should not be admitted unless it is accompanied by a motion expressing confidence in a named individual.

Borrowed from the German system, the Law Commission had recommended the new system in the aftermath of the fall of Vajpayee government by one vote in 1999 in its report on reforming the electoral laws.

The commission feels that the change does not even entail constitutional amendment. Addition of rule 198A in the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the Lok Sabha would do.

The Law Commission had also recommended that once a no-confidence is taken up for discussion and voted upon, no fresh motion expressing want of confidence in the council of ministers shall be permitted for two years from the date of voting of such motion. Advani''s other idea of synchronising parliamentary and assembly elections was also suggested by the commission in the same report.

The latest no-confidence motion has set the Commission thinking again. Says member N M Ghatate: ""There are three advantages of adopting no-confidence along with confidence motion. One, the country would have a PM who commands majority in the house. Last time, when Vajpayee lost by one vote, he was a lame duck PM for six months,"" he says.

Second, the President would never get dragged into the vortex of politics. How? ""In coalition politics when no party wins a majority, the President uses discretion in chosing a man who will lead the government. But if he is not sure of the choice and gets criticism. It happened when Neelam Sanjeeva Reddy chose Charan Singh after Morarji Desai''s government fell and Shankar Dayal Sharma decided on Vajpyee in 1996,"" he explains.

Third, the Parliament would continue for five years. What if house does not have confidence in any other leader? Says Ghatate: ""The German system is the best. In case the House cannot elect a leader, the President has the power to dissolve the House. This threat helps them to elect a leader. This can be done here also.""

Though Ghatate denies that the Law Commission''s idea was borne out of the Vajpayee government''s 1999 experience, he maintains that it is not undemocratic and unconstitutional. ""The Parliament would continue for five years but the government can still change and a new PM can be elected. Even the Supreme Court in the Bommai case said the best way to choose a PM is the floor test. How is it undemocratic? Our Constitution says that the term of the Parliament is for five years,"" Ghatate says, and gives the instance of the Rajasthan Municipality law which stipulates that once a mayor is elected, a no-confidence motion cannot be brought for two years.

Hopeful that one day the government would accept the Law Commission''s recommendation on a no-confidence motion, Ghatate says other recommendations like auditing of party accounts, ceiling on expenditure and regular elections have been accepted.

18,"Satellite surveillance of border needed, says J-K minister","AMRITSAR: The Centre must go in for satellite surveillance of the Jammu and Kashmir border with Pakistan to check the inflow of terrorists, said Chaudhary Lal Singh, minister for health, family welfare and medical education, Jammu and Kashmir.

With 75 per cent of militants in the valley being foreign mercenaries, the 25 per cent intake from among Kashmiris can be curtailed through consistent efforts, he pointed out. Lal told Times News Network that they had submitted this proposal to the Centre as it was impossible to watch the border and deploy security forces at every point, given the topography of the region.

He also expressed serious doubts over the results of Track II diplomacy initiated for normalising Indo-Pakistan ties. Talking at variance with the central governmentâ€™s â€œgive and takeâ€� stance to resolve the Kashmir issue, Lal said that they were not ready to give a single inch of Indian land to Pakistan.

And that instead of promoting Track II diplomacy government should engage in straight discussion with Pakistan to sort out contentious issues. He also observed that the time wasnâ€™t ripe for the return of Hindus who had left the Valley due to fear of terrorists. About the health services in J and K, Lal said they had begun tele-medicine service at Leh, Kashmir, Kathua and Poonch, and these centres were linked to All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, and Apollo hospitals.

The service would be extended to all places, which get cut off during extreme weather conditions. Floating medical health services on the Dal Lake would also be strengthened to provide medical aid to tourists and those staying in the area. Lal, who is on a peace march from Jammu to Haridwar, also lit candles at the Wagah border.

The arguments went on until the TTE found two seats for the two boys somewhere else. ""Finally, I agreed to the minister''s demand that his two daughters would stay in the cabin provided he apologised to my wife. To my pleasant surprise he apologised.

""A senior minister, Mr Siddique, arrived and asked if everything got settled. He was courteous to my wife

""Just when I thought everything ended peacefully and we were about to turn the lights off, Mr Hassan turned to me and said, ''You are a professor from America. You have law there. But in Bihar I am the Law. If I want I can stop the Rajdhani Express and turn it back.'' Then he told his daughters, ''If they were Indians, I would have thrown them out by grabbing their shoulders.''
