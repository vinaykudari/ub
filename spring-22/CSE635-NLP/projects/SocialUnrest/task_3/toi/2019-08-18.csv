0,Cong to stage dharnas against NDA govt,"CHANDIGARH: The Haryana Congress on Saturday decided to stage â€œdharnasâ€� in all the districts in the state to highlight the alleged irregularities committed by the NDA government at the Centre in the allotment of petrol pumps, gas agencies and land.

A decision to this effect was taken at a meeting here of district Congress presidents presided over by AICC secretary Hanumantha Rao.

Rao exhorted the DCC presidents to work hard to apprise the people of the policies and programmes of the Congress.

1,BJP may not be averse to Prez rule,"GANDHINAGAR: Contrary to popular belief, a powerful section in the BJP is not entirely averse to the idea of imposition of President''s rule in Gujarat till fresh elections are held.

The view of this dominant section is that with former ''pracharak'' Sundar Singh Bhandari as governor, a stint of President''s rule could work as a smooth transition, one that could help the party overcome the anti-incumbency factor and also leave Chief Minister Narendra Modi free for organisation-building.

Well-placed sources said some leaders discussed the issue with Bhandari informally on Saturday morning, a day after the Election Commission turned down the plea for holding early elections in the state.

Later in the evening, Bhandari left for New Delhi, ostensibly to attend Vice-President Bhairon Singh Shekhawat''s swearing-in ceremony on Monday. He is likely to meet some senior BJP leaders in New Delhi on Sunday. Sources said it is likely that the move for President''s rule may be supported even by Prime Minister Vajpayee.

What with the demand for President''s rule being renewed by the Congress after Friday''s EC order, a section in the BJP feels that with the power crisis worsening and a drought facing the state, it would be in the party''s interest to run the show by proxy.

It is significant that the ruling BJP, which is being advised on legal matters by e general secretary Arun Jaitley, has decided against going for an appeal in court for holding elections sooner.

Instead, an attempt is underway to turn the EC order to the party''s advantage. ""If President''s rule is imposed, we will be ruling the state and yet can pass the blame onto the bureacracy for any resentment that may surface among voters,"" reasoned a senior BJP leader.

In this connection, some BJP leaders said Modi as CM had been forced to call off the ''Gaurav Yatra''.

""If he ceases to function as the chief minister, he will be able to concentrate entirely on the campaign,"" said a leader, articulating the thinking in the party. Besides, he said, the condition that Keshubhai Patel had imposed on the party - that he wouldn''t campaign if Modi was projected as the next chief minister - would also be taken care of.

However, Modi''s views on the subject are not yet known and it is felt that he may not be willing to relinquish office yet as there are a lot of things that go with chief ministership.

Senior lawyer Girish Patel, who had met the EC in Ahmedabad and demanded postponement of elections, said: ""With Bhandari as governor and BJP ruling in New Delhi, President''s rule in Gujarat will hardly make any difference.""

However, since powers would be vested in the Union Cabinet to take decisions on Gujarat, it might help in restoring confidence among the people, he added.

2,Curfew in Dhoraji after clashes,"AHMEDABAD: A clash between two communities at Dhoraji town of Rajkot district left several residents injured and some autorickshaws damaged and burnt. Indefinite curfew was clamped over Dhoraji at 2.30 pm.

On Saturday afternoon a quarrel over parking of a cycle-rickshaw in front of a shop snowballed into a communal clash. Local residents poured out in large numbers on to the streets at the Nadi market place and threw stones and soda bottles at each other.

Eleven persons were injured in this free-for-all that last for more than an hour before the police could arrive and restore order. Police fired five tear-gas shells to disperse the mobs.

District collector of Rajkot Anita Karwal, who rushed to the spot, told TNN: ""The situation is now under control. We are trying to ascertain as to how such a petty matter assumed a communal colour and who could be behind this sudden eruption of violence.""

The district superintendent of police V M Pargi told TNN: ""About 150 persons have been arrested. Some of them for rioting and some for violating curfew.""

3,"No polls, clouds on Gujarat's horizon","GANDHINAGAR: With the Election Commission having finally said a firm ''no'' to early polls in Gujarat, officials hope that Chief Minister Narendra Modi would now agree to declare some districts as drought affected.

The government was so far dragging its feet on the issue on the ground that an impending drought would further negate the chances for early elections.

The state has so far received 45 per cent rainfall of its 10-year average this monsoon, and out of 225 talukas, rainfall received in 137 talukas was less than 300 mm.

Sources in the Chief Minister''s Office confirmed that despite this the chief minister had not given any instruction to carry out a survey of crop damage, which preceded any move to declare certain areas as ''drought-hit''.

The worst affected region is, of course, Kutch. Five talukas in the district have still not received more than 50 mm of rainfall. Four other talukas of the district have received less than 100 mm of rainfall. The state received an average rainfall of 852.68 mm in 1991-2000.

Kutch is followed by 10 talukas in Ahmedabad district, seven in Anand, 12 in Banaskantha, 9 each in Jamnagar, Junagadh and Mehsana, 7 in Patan, 12 in Rajkot, 10 in Sabarkantha and 9 in Surendranagar, where rainfall received this monsoon ranged between 51 mm and 300 mm.

State agriculture minister Purshottam Rupala has already declared that despite the late rains, 30-40 per cent of the sown area faces a bleak future.

He has instructed district authorities to ask the affected farmers to quickly switch over to the cultivation of fodder so that at least their cattle could be saved and the farmers could earn something.

Yet, while other states have declared several of their districts drought-hit and even demanded a bigger share from the Central assistance, Gujarat seems to be in no mood to do the same.

State irrigation minister Babubhai Bokhiria said, ""It is in October alone that the drought-hit areas and districts can be identified after assessment.""

Out of the 183 irrigation dams in the state, 86 have received less than 25 per cent of rainfall. And of the 11 major dams, only four hold between 50 and 80 per cent water of their total storage capacity.

Bokhiria claims that the state has been doing ""all it can to save the crops"". He said, ""We have given instructions to district collectors to release the water needed to save the crops.""

4,Modi govt pats own back over EC's order,"GANDHINAGAR: The irrepressible Narendra Modi government on Saturday ignored all the indictment of its performance in the 40-page Election Commission order which rules out early election in Gujarat.

Instead, a government spokesman said, ""The EC''s decision to hold the elections after the revision of voters list indicated that the law and order situation in the state is well under control"".

Notwithstanding the EC criticism about the prevailing sense of insecurity, he said, ""The decision (to postpone polls) has proved that those who were crying foul making an issue out of disturbances were absolutely wrong and baseless"".

He further said, ""The decision has weakened the hands of those who had unsuccessfully tried to belittle Gujarat and spread the canard that the situation in the state was not normal"".

Secretary of the state unit of Communist Party of India AN Shaikh while welcoming the decision to hold elections when the situation becomes conducive for the same, demanded dismissal of the Modi government and imposition of President''s rule in Gujarat.

The GPCC legal cell at its meeting on Saturday demanded immediate imposition of President''s rule.

It said that even after dissolution of the Assembly, the government had been functioning in a careless, irresponsible and unconstitutional manner. Under these circumstances, the Modi government should be dismissed under Article 356 and President''s rule imposed.

GPCC president Shankersinh Vaghela presided over the meeting and legal cell chairman Maganbhai Barot was among those who attended it.

5,Trinamul to take part in Monday's all-party meet,"KOLKATA: While Mamata Banerjee was busy holding confabulations in Delhi, the Trinamul Congress declared that it would attend the allparty meeting convened by West Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on Monday and adopt a common strategy to fight the railway bifurcation.

Announcing this on Saturday, party leader Pankaj Banerjee said,â€œWe had asked the chief minister to convene the meeting a long time ago. If all the parties came together then, the matter would not have gone this far.â€� He sighed, â€œThe chief minister is late in everything he does. Bhattacharjee went to Purulia after all chief ministers finished visiting their respective drought-hit areas.â€�

According to Banerjee, partyâ€™s national general secretary Mukul Roy and his counterpart from the state Partha Chattopadhyay will attend the Monday meeting. Earlier, the Trinamul had refused to participate in an allparty delegation of MLAs to Delhi on the issue.

Meanwhile, Mamata met vice-president-elect Bhairon Singh Shekhawat in Delhi earlier in the day â€œto thank him for expressing concern over the railway bifurcationâ€�.

Shekhawat had reportedly called up and assured her on Friday to look into the matter. â€œMamata thanked Shekhawat for the call and congratulated him on his election. Earlier, she had apprised the Prime Minister of the Trinamulâ€™s working committee decision to stay away from the NDA till the bifurcation was reconsidered,â€� said Banerjee.

Mamata made a â€˜courtesyâ€™ call on the PM on Friday. She is slated to return to the city on Sunday.

8,Man arrested for conning investors,"PUNE: The Cantonment police on Friday arrested a man for cheating scores of small investors under the guise of an incredibly lucrative investment scheme.

The name of the arrested person is Sanjay Kadam. His partner in the alleged crime, Sanjay Takle, is still missing.

According to the police, the two conned investors by floating a firm called Akanksha Marketing Concepts Limited near the Hussainy Bakery on Taboot street in Pune Camp.

Under its Multi-Cable Marketing Scheme, they invited investors to deposit Rs 2,100, rope in one more investor and earn 30 per cent of the total amount. They also gave away gifts worth Rs 1,500 to depositors at the time of investment, the police said.

Those introducing two subscribers to the scheme were promised 35 per cent of the turnover, 45 per cent for three members and 53 per cent for nine investors. Although Kadam and Takle disbursed such hefty commissions, they recently shut shop and fled.

The main complainant in the case, Babasaheb Malkondi Benali (48), had invested more than Rs 3 lakh in the name of his family members. Although he earned Rs 1.19 lakh as commission, he lost the rest of the amount.

The police have registered a case under section 420 of Indian Penal Code besides section 3 of Protection of Small Investors and Depositors Rights Act.

Assistant police inspector N Sheikh is investigating the case.

9,Foreign observers must be allowed for J&K polls: Gujral,"NEW DELHI: Former Prime Minister I K Gujral has strongly advocated inviting and giving all facilities to foreign observers to watch the polls in Jammu and Kashmir.

""The poll is a window of opportunity to wash away the sins of the past. We have not been able to carry all the sections of the people in Jammu and Kashmir with us. But through a free and fair elections we can remove the doubts and suspicions of the people,"" Gujral said at a ''Public Meet'' here on Saturday.

Pointing out that the ""institution of observers"" was not new in the subcontinent, Gujral said the polls must be carried out in the presence of observers which should be ""seen as entirely in the country''s interest.""

Recalling the time when he was a member of a team of observers which went to Pakistan, Gujral said, ""Benazir won that particular election. But she told me that she really won the election when observers from India told her that it was free and fair.""

Observers were allowed in Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Nepal too during polls, he added.

Lauding former Union Law Minister Ram Jethmalani''s efforts to bring all the parties involved together for discussions, he disagreed with suggestions that Jethmalani''s efforts were too late saying ""it is better late than never"".

10,SC to hear petition on J&K elections,"NEW DELHI: With the Election Commission deferring polls in Gujarat due to irregularities in the voters'' list, the Supreme Court will hear a petition tomorrow seeking postponment of September elections in J&K on the ground that the state electoral rolls have not been revised since 1988.

A Bench comprising Justice R C Lahoti and Justice Brijesh Kumar raised two questions on admissibility of the petition filed by Panthers Party Chief Bhim Singh and asked him to make up the deficiencies by Monday when the case would be heard.

The Bench asked him as to why he did not approach the J&K High Court and also whether he had given any representation to the Election Commission on irregularities in electoral rolls.

Singh, who claimed to have given written representation to the EC in this regard, said in his petition ""it is an admitted fact that nearly 1,50,000 names of the voters who died from 1990 till date have not been removed from the existing electoral rolls.""

The petitioner sought a direction from the Court to the Election Commission and the State Government to prepare voters list in accordance with Registration of Electoral Rules, 1960.

In case of Gujarat, the Commission found the situation on the ground in relation to electoral rolls, photo identity cards and relief and rehabilitation measures as unsatisfactory and ordered a special revision of electoral rolls with house to house enumeration in 20 riot-affected districts to update the rolls.

11,"SBI hints at rate cut, to restructure agricultural loans","NEW DELHI: The State Bank of India on Sunday hinted at lowering of lending rates, especially for priority sector loans, and said it will restructure agricultural loans given to farmers in drought-hit areas.

""Reserve Bank has instructed the banks about places that has been affected by drought. We will restructure loans in these areas,"" SBI chairman Janki Ballabh said on the sidelines of a function for granting Kishan Credit Card in Bagpat.

The bank intends to either extend the maturity period of loans taken by drought affected farmers or reduce the interest rate to facilitate them in repaying loans in better seasons. Ballabh said directives have been issued to all branches in drought-hit areas to look into problems of farmers.

Although the SBI chief foresees ""some revival"" of monsoon, he said ""there is a possibility of further reduction in lending rates depending on how much the bank was able to reduce its transaction costs and cost of funds."" ""There has to be reduction in interest rates for priority sector, especially on advances to weaker section and small farmers,"" he added, hinting at further cut in lending rates.

SBI''s prime lending rate (PLR) is at 11 per cent, but the bank lends at sub-PLR rates of 8.5-9 per cent to some of the sectors like exporters, which would be reduced further to provide relief to trouble-torn farmers. The bank''s interest costs is at 6.5 per cent while the cost of funds is at 8.5-9 per cent owing to operational expenses and non-performing assets.

The SBI chief said the bank plans to increase its direct advances to the agricultural sector to 18 per cent of total advances by March 2004, from 16 per cent in March 2002.

12,Left parties criticise Cabinet decision on Guj polls,"NEW DELHI: The Left parties on Sunday criticised the Union Cabinet''s decision to refer the Election Commission order on Gujarat polls to the President saying it displayed its ""contempt"" for the autonomy and independence of the poll panel.

""By doing so, the Cabinet has shown utter contempt for the independent existential status of the EC. It also displays their intention to actually use the communal polarisation in Gujarat to their political advantage against the country''s integrity,"" CPI-M Polit Bureau member Sitaram Yechury said here.

Asserting that there was ""no constitutional crisis"" as was being portrayed by the Cabinet, he said Article 324 has given EC the ""sole right to determine whether they can hold free and fair elections"" and Article 174 ""applies only to a live assembly"". Hence the BJP Government''s claims about a constitutional crisis was ""totally hollow"".

""It is very unfortunate that the office of the President is being dragged for petty political purposes,"" Yechury said.

In a statement, CPI-ML, while criticising the Cabinet decision, said the President ""should take this opportunity to affirm the autonomy and dignity of the EC and recommend dismissal of the Narendra Modi Government and impose President''s Rule in Gujarat"".

13,Cong slams Cabinet decision on Gujarat elections,"NEW DELHI: The Congress on Sunday castigated the Cabinet decision to refer the Election Commission order on Gujarat polls to the President saying it was tantamount to ""an assault on the Constitutional authority and dignity"" of the poll panel.

The decision ""confirms that the BJP government does not respect the institutions empowered under the Constitution for superintendence and conduct of the elections"", party spokesman Anand Sharma said here.

He said it was clear that the government and the BJP leadership ""have acted in furtherance of their agenda to cynically exploit the communal divide of their creation for electoral benefits"".

Stating that Deputy Prime Minister LK Advani had said in Parliament that the government would honour the EC decision on Gujarat, he said ""with today''s Cabinet decision, the government has gone back on its promise"".

He said it was unfortunte that the BJP had sought to ""question the very motive of the EC"", which has come out with ""a considered and judicious view after having taken note of the communal tension, failure of administration in rehabilitation of riot victims, feeling of insecurity among voters and non-updating of electoral rolls"".

Stating that EC''s powers under the Constitution were ""unfettered"", Sharma said it was only for the poll panel to determine whether the situation on the ground was conducive for the conduct of free and fair polls and also that all eligible voters were able to cast their votes without coercion or fear.

14,BJP will win polls: Modi,"AHMEDABAD: Recovering from the jolt over the Election Commission''s decision against early Assembly polls in Gujarat, Chief Minister Narendra Modi has claimed that the BJP will win whenever the elections are held in the state.

""BJP will win the Assembly polls in the state whenever they are held, whether in November-December, or in year 2003 or 2013,"" Modi told a television news channel at Patan in north Gujarat on Saturday.

""If the Congress feels that the Election Commission''s decision would help them win the elections, then they are under an illusion. BJP will win the elections whenever they are held and the five crore people of Gujarat would decide the winners and losers,"" he said.

Modi was in Patan to attend a number of functions, including opening of a new court complex.

Meanwhile, Defence Minister George Fernandes, who was in Bhavnagar on Saturday, said he was ""disillusioned"" with the Election Commission''s decision.

15,Trinamul blames govt for attack,"KOLKATA: The Trinamul Congress has condemned the attack on the CPM Dhupguri party office by suspected Kamtapur Liberation Organisation militants on Saturday evening. Five people were killed in the attack.

The Trinamul will conduct an independent inquiry into the attack and demand necessary action from the Union home ministry.

â€œWe condemn militancy in any form and the attack on any political party. We do not subscribe to the politics of murder. We strongly condemn Saturdayâ€™s attack,â€� partyâ€™s state general secretary Partha Chattopadhyay said in Kolkata on Sunday.

Chattopadhyay, however, blamed the state government for its failure to curb militancy in the state.

â€œThere has been a spurt of mili-tant activity in West Bengal in recent times. Saturdayâ€™s attack and the American Center incident prove that. We have cautioned the state government a number of times but no step has been taken,â€� he said.

He favoured the idea of the state government convening an all-party meeting on militancy to find steps to control it.

The Trinamul leader, however, said it was too early to blame any particular militant organisation for the attack. â€œFor all we know, it may have been the result of intra-party rivalry.

However, it is true that ISI activities are on the rise in West Bengal whereas the state government continues to maintain that it as an oasis of peace,â€� Chattopadhyay said.

16,Mahajan to check all aspects of law,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Union Minister Pramod Mahajan on Sunday said he would have to look into various aspects of the law before filing a defamation suit against Madhu Sharma, wife of Ravi Kant Sharma, wanted in the Shivani Bhatnagar murder case, for dragging his name into the case.

Talking to reporters here, he said he would have to check ""three aspects of the law"" with his lawyer, including that of Madhu Sharma who was ""changing her statement every day.""

Mahajan said he also did not want his defamation suit to become more important than the ""actual case"" which was being investigated. He said he was styding the Indian law, as often defamation cases took a long time for settlement.

He said he was not afraid of facing any inquiry decided by the investigating agency. ""I am open to any probe since I haven''t committed any wrong. Delhi police is investigating the case. It is for the agency to decide whether somebody is to be interrogated or put to lie detector test,"" he said when asked about Madhu Sharma''s reported demand that Mahajan be put to polygraph test.

Asked about the demand reportedly made by Sharma''s kin that Mahajan be subjected to DNA test to ascertain the paternity of Shivani''s child, he said ""the father of the child is not making any demand. If a third person makes a demand, then all of us have to undergo DNA test.""

17,Oppn flays Cabinet decision on Gujarat polls,"NEW DELHI: Constitutional experts and Opposition parties have accused the government of creating an unnecessary controversy by deciding to refer the Election Commissionâ€™s (EC) decision on the Gujarat polls to President Kalam.

â€˜â€˜The ECâ€™s decision on Gujarat elections is unquestionable; I am sure the Supreme Court will uphold it if its opinion is sought by the President,â€™â€™ legal expert and former law minister Shanti Bhushan told Times News Network on Sunday. He said the BJP-led governmentâ€™s refusal to accept the EC decision would â€˜â€˜reflect on itâ€™â€™.

Senior constitutional expert and Rajya Sabha member Fali S Nariman too, justified the EC decision. â€˜â€˜In my opinion, the EC has acted correctly,â€™â€™ he said.

However, Nariman did not see anything extraordinary in the governmentâ€™s move. â€˜â€˜It is the governmentâ€™s prerogative to refer it to the President,â€™â€™ he said.

Former Chief Justice of India, A S Anand declined to comment on the ground that the matter was being referred to the apex court.

The Congress assailed the government for attempting to â€˜â€˜impair the authority and dignity of the ECâ€™â€™. Party spokesman Anand Sharma said the government had gone back on its assurance to Parliament that it would accept the ECâ€™s decision on Gujarat.

â€˜â€˜Despite Advaniâ€™s sta-tement in Parliament during the Gujarat debate, the government has now chosen to question the ECâ€™s decision. It is unfortunate because under the Constitution, the ECâ€™s power is unfettered,â€™â€™ he said.

CPM politburo member Prakash Karat said, â€˜â€˜It is another step to undermine the constitutional authority of the EC. The President is being dragged into a needless controversy.â€™â€™ He felt that the cabinet decision was unwarranted since no constitutional problem had arisen.

His party colleague Sitaram Yechury said that by its action, the government â€˜â€˜has shown its contempt for the independent status of the EC and sought to subvert the parliamentary systemâ€™â€™.

Alleging that the Central government wanted to â€˜â€˜take control of the mode of transport which is a state subject,â€™â€™ Delhi state transport minister Ajay Maken said the city government would resist the move and is working on a response.

â€˜â€˜The Centre has spent just 15 per cent on the project while the Delhi government have spent the rest. The project is making fast progress just because we have ensured that there is no paucity of funds for it,â€™â€™ he said.

19,Mafia stalls liquor sale at govt vend,"NEW DELHI: A tussle between the liquor mafia and the Delhi government has spilled on to roads with alleged sympathisers of Haryana-based liquor smugglers laying siege to a Delhi Tourism liquor vend in Nangloi.

The vend appears to have invited the wrath of the liquor mafia as its brisk sales had started eating into their profits from sale of illicit liquor which was being smuggled from Haryana.

The protesters, including women, allegedly manhandled and prevented over 200 customers from purchasing liquor from the vend in Rajdhani Park area of Nangloi on the eve of Independence Day, a dry day.

â€˜â€˜They have been sitting outside the vend and preventing customers from purchasing liquor from the vend,â€™â€™ said managing director, Delhi Tourism and Transportation Development Corporation (DTTDC), Rajeev Talwar.

In view of the agitation, DTTDC has sought police protection for smooth operation of the vend.

Deputy commissioner of police, west, Dependra Pathak claimed a picket had been set up near the vend to ensure no problem was caused to the customers approaching the vend for buying liquor.

â€˜â€˜The protest is being carried out by local villagers and we are trying to maintain law and order in the area,â€™â€™ he said. Pathak denied the possibility of associates of liquor smugglers provoking villagers against the vend.

A DTTDC official, however, claimed despite police presence the protesters had managed to get close to the vend on several occasions. This, he said, was scaring customers away.

20,"North Bengal tense, CPM calls bandh","DHUPGURI: Life came to a halt in this north Bengal town on Sunday as the CPM observed a bandh in protest against Saturdayâ€™s firing by militants on the partyâ€™s Dhupguri office.

Five deaths were confirmed officially in the attack. Three others were said to be critical. The CPM has called a further bandh in the Jalpaiguri, Cooch Behar and Darjeeling districts on Monday.

Sitting at the party office amid bullet marks and blood stains, former forest minister Banamali Roy said the attack was the Kamtapur Liberation Organisationâ€™s handiwork. â€œIt was planned to terrorise the masses,â€� he said.

Jalpaiguri MP Minati Sen and district CPM secretary Manik Sanyal felt that militant outfits such as the United Liberation Front of Asom, National Democratic Front of Bodoland and KLO were still holding out in Bhutan and they wanted to keep their Bhutan-Assam route undisturbed.

People of nearby villages such as Salbari and Sonakhali refused to talk out of fear. Two platoons of the state armed police and one of the CRPF had been deployed, said additional SP A. Kumar.

Director general of police Dinesh Vajpai is expected to arrive in Jalpaiguri on Monday. Dhupguri and Moynaguri fall within the Bhutan-Assam route and serve as the militantsâ€™ supply hub.

Dhupguri, with the Jaldhaka river in the west and Torsha in the east, is within a few kilometres from the Khutimari forest. With this, the jungles of Ramsahi, Garumara and Jaldhaka form a 27-km forest corridor up to the Bhutan border.

The river beds of Dyna, Murty and Jaldhaka also serve as routes for militants. â€œThus, keeping Dhupguri and Moynaguri under control is too important for them,â€� Sanyal said.

The additional SP said that KLO operatives who earlier used to get large donations were now short of funds since people were not bowing to them following the arrest and surrender of least 15 leaders.

â€œBy creating terror, they are trying to build up favourable conditions again,â€� he said. Most CPM leaders indirectly blamed â€œinadequateâ€� police action for repeated attacks on party members.

In Jalpaiguri, eight Left Front leaders were gunned down by the KLO last year. Some Congress supporters and many common people suspected, however, that internal tussles of the CPM were responsible for the killings.
