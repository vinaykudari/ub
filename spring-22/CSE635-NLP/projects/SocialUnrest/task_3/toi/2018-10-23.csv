0,"Satam, 8 Sainiks charged for protests","mumbai: the worli police have booked former mayor, nandu satam and eight other shiv sainiks for rioting and defying prohibitory orders by staging a maha-aarti and holding protests against the 10 p.m. deadline for dandiya celebrations. no arrests have been made but top police sources said action will soon be taken against the defaulters. the maha-aartis at worli and kherwadi had caused major traffic jams on saturday night. besides mr satam, the police have booked nandu gawde, eknath salvi, sanjay gaikwad, chhotu desai, deepak bagwe, rajesh dhupe and hemant shinde under sections 143, 149 and 349 of the indian penal code and section 135 of the bombay police act. mr satam, when contacted, said the sena would continue to stage maha-aartis but care would be taken not to cause any inconvenience to the common man as directed by party chief, bal thackeray. but joint commissioner of police (law and order), v.n.deshmukh told tnn that even protests against the deadline amounted to contempt of the supreme court which had issued orders for strict implementation of the environment protection act, 1986 and the noise pollution (control and regulation) rules, 2000. the ep act provides for an imprisonment of five years and a fine of rs 5 lakhs for the defaulter. if the authorities do not take action against the defaulters, they are also liable for similar prosecution. according to the police, a case was registered against mr satam when on saturday he along with a large number of shiv sainiks staged a dharna at worli naka demanding that the sarvajanik navratri utsav of panchmukhi mitra mandal at worli naka be allowed to use loudspeakers beyond the 10 p.m. deadline set by the supreme court. mr deshmukh said, the police had no problem with any religious group staging aartis or maha-aartis provided no loudspeakers were played beyond the deadline. ``so far, 43 maha-aartis have been held in the city and no law and order problem was reported. we have no objection if large number of devotees gather for such aartis' but it should not lead to violation of any law. in fact, we have no objection even if they play dandiya beyond 10 p.m. but without using the loudspeakers,'' he said. ironically, the police are taking action only for flouting the 10 p.m. deadline and not for violation of the decibel levels since the department has no noise meters to measure the noise levels. the police have estimated, they need at least 12 noise meters which could be ferried by patrol vans to different venues to measure the noise levels. a noise meter costs between rs 70,000 to rs 1.5 lakhs.

1,Ayodhya incident: AMU demands JPC inquiry,"aligarh: the aligarh muslim university staff association has demanded a probe by a joint parliamentary committee (jpc) into last week's incident at ayodhya where vhp leaders broke the security cordon and stormed inside the sanctum sanctorum of the ram janmabhoomi complex. members of the association, at the special meeting, also demanded a jpc probe into a similar incident at agra where members of the sangh parivar went on the rampage inside taj mahal. the amu teachers said that both these incidents are ''part'' of a well orchestrated campaign to inflame communal passions on the eve of the up assembly elections. association president naseem beg told times news network later: ''muslims should, however, not fall into the trap laid by the sangh parivar and act with restraint despite the provocations caused by recent incidents.'' beg said: ''the country, and in fact the whole world, is passing through a very critical juncture and all sections of society should not do anything to weaken the country's unity and solidarity. it is shameful that leaders of the sangh parivar are indulging in provocative acts which can only weaken the country's solidarity just for the sake of gaining some electoral mileage.'' the staff association leaders said that a jpc inquiry was necessary as there were reports that the state government was trying to ''hush up'' both the incidents. the association also accused the up government of deliberately tampering with the electoral rolls in the state ''to rig the elections''.

2,"Bhadauria let off the hook, Singh is KGMC principal","lucknow: it's official now. gs bhadauria, reader in ancient indian history department of the lucknow university, has been exonerated of the charges of 'scandalous misconduct'. also, dr km singh is the permanent principal of the king george's medical college. the lu executive council approved both the decision on monday evening. the ec also finalised december 13 as the date of annual convocation and recommended the name of sgpgi director prof ms bhandari for the three-member search panel for the selection of the new vice-chancellor of the lucknow university. the tenure of the present incumbent completes on january 7, 2002. the other two members of the said panel will be recommended by the chief justice of the high court and the governor, who is also the chancellor of state universalities. a gold medal and two scholarships were also approved for the toppers of the department of botany. bhadauria was accused of allegedly jotting down lewd remarks against nishi pandey, reader in the english department. earlier, on august 20, bhadauria was given a clean chit in a case in which he was charged with sexually harassing girl students of the institute of tourism management four years back. on monday, the ec accepted the recommendation of the three-member disciplinary committee which said that 'proceedings against bhadauria be dropped as pandey failed to produce any witnesses or evidence.' the decision to exonerate bhadauria invited stiff opposition from some ec members, who demanded that the inquiry should be conducted as per government rules. however, majority ruled in favour of bhadauria. it was learnt that in its report the disciplinary committee suggested nishi pandey to accept the apology of bhadauria, if he did so, in good faith. ec members were of the view that by refusing to testify before the committee, pandey had shown disrespect to the vice-chancellor and the executive council. there was also anger among the ec members for the alleged hard words used by pandey in her representation to the governor.

3,"PM flays attack, tells Pak to shun violence","lucknow: prime minister atal behari vajpyee on monday strongly denounced pakistan for its attempt to attack srinagar air base and said that if it does not shun the path of confrontation there can be no further discussions with pervez musharraf during his visit to new york next month. india feels offended by pakistan's posture and the latest incident is a setback to our peace efforts with islamabad, the involvement of which is evident in the attack, the prime minister said while talking to newsmen here at raj bhawan after his hectic day-long schedule in the state capital. in reply to a question he said, i do not think there is any need for talk if it does not serve any purpose. but he added that india was open to peace efforts on the pre-condition that pakistan must stop cross-border terrorism in kashmir and elsewhere in india. reiterating india's stand on terrorism, the pm said that our view on the issue had been gradually appreciated by the world, including the us, which itself was fighting a war against terrorism. we too are committed to eliminating terrorism from our soil and for this we are fully prepared, he said, adding that we are not to be governed on the issue by america or anybody else. probed on what the government planned to do to combat terrorism in kashmir, mr vajpayee said that 'we have something decisive in our mind but we will not divulge what it is.' vajpayee said that it was wrong to say that india's foreign policy was influenced by america. that india joined the world in condemning the attack on world trade centre (wtc) should not be misinterpreted, the pm clarified. we never allow america to have its say in our foreign policy, the pm said and disclosed that new delhi had snubbed washington when it rejected outright its proposal for a compromise and foregoing some of its land during the kargil conflict. in reply to another question, the pm said india favoured a broad-based popular government minus the taliban after the end of the war. he also justified defence minister george fernandes's statement in which he had held pakistan responsible for attack on wtc and said that it he did not see anything wrong in it as taliban was a creation of pakistan. on the supply of medicines to america, he said it had been done on humanitarian ground. with regard to the exodus of indians from bangladesh in the wake of the new government there, the pm said, we are very much concerned about the issue. the matter had already been taken up with bangladesh, he said and hoped that a solution would be found to the problem soon.

4,'Conduct UP polls fast',"hyderabad: the central committee of the cpm has demanded that the government immediately take steps to conduct elections to the uttar pradesh assembly. ""the term of the present government expired on october 17 and it has no legal right to govern the state anymore,"" cpm politburo member sitaram yechury said. speaking to reporters on monday, yechury expressed concern that the bjp was bent on using religion for gain in the up assembly elections and was therefore trying to fan communal passions. the cpm would represent the issue to the centre as well as the president asking them to ensure that such a situation, which could result in a major crisis, does not occur. he said that the two-year rule of the bjp-led nda government at the centre has only resulted in 'very deep crisis' in the economic sector and had given rise to recession. ""unemployment is high while suicides and starvation deaths have become a common phenomenon in many states. the government should take firm steps like implementation of food for work programme at the national level to control this,"" he suggested.

6,Citizens debate helmet rule,"pune: even as the congress-led democratic front government has used its head and made helmets compulsory for two-wheeler drivers, the city unit of the party decided to hold a debate on the issue on monday. 'helmets - should they be made compulsory or not' was attended by a large number of people hotly debating what has become a contentious issue, with the december 1 deadline drawing near. madhusudan bhide, who has written to successive government protesting any rule making helmets compulsory, argued that government should focus on the ""larger picture"" to reduce accidents instead of concentrating only on two-wheeler riders. ""anyone walking on the road or riding a cycle can also meet with an accident. will the government then make helmets compulsory for them too?"" he questioned. it was mr bhide's contention that a person not wearing a helmet does not cause loss of life or damage to property while going on the road, and the the state government's directive deprives a person of his fundamental right of freedom of movement! he argued that the government should make serious efforts to control smoking instead of limiting its concern to a statutory warning. dr vidya yerwadekar, director of symbiosis health centre, argued strongly that state governments decision to make helmets compulsory is necessary to save loss of young lives. giving statistics, she said there were almost 17 students in her college who suffered serious head injuries due to rash driving. ""but ever since symbiosis society made it compulsory for its students to wear helmets, the number of cases related to head injuries have come down drastically."" sassoon hospital has several cases of serious head injuries, she added. ms yerwadekar said it had been proved scientifically that isi marked helmets do not cause any problems in vision or hearing. ""the peripherial vision offered by a standard helmet is good enough to see each side while driving,"" she said. siddharth desai, a student from mit college, said that although he personally supported wearing helmets, it should not be imposed forcibly through legislation. he said vision is a problem while wearing helmets notwithstanding the scientific figures quoted by some speakers. ""there are so many youths who break signals and drive their vehicles on a one-way street without any restrictions. this shows that just having rules does not cure the problem; rather there should be stricter implementation of the existing laws,"" he said. dr pradeep bafna, a neuro-surgeon at ruby hall clinic, said helmets should be made compulsory as head injuries can reduce a person literally to a vegetable-like state. ""the amount of money spent on treatment of head injuries is exorbitant and still does not guarantee a successful result,"" he said. although creating awareness is better than implementing a rule strictly, somehow people in pune have not responded to various drives and hence the state rule had become mandatory, he felt.

7,Soren criticises Jharkhand govt,"jamshedpur: jmm president sibu soren has criticised the babulal marandi government in jharkhand for the ""pathetic pace"" of development which had caused a ""large-scale exodus"" of tribals to other states. it was unfortunate that such exodus of tribals continued despite the fact that jharkhand was rich in natural resources. ""the babulal marandi government should concentrate on the development of the state as it will be accountable for all its misdeeds on the pretext of development,"" he told newsmen on monday. about the state's reservation policy, he said it was irrelevant at the moment and suggested that prevailing imbalances be removed first. ""if the government is serious about the uplift of poor tribals, then it should give top priority to tribes like chero, paharia and malpahari who are on the verge of extinction. ""it is obvious the reign of power has fallen into the hands of people those who always opposed the creation of separate tribal state and hardly had any contribution in the jharkhand movement...jmm will not allow anyone to play with the sentiments of tribals"", he said. referring to extremists' activities in jharkhand, soren said the chief minister was alone not responsible. ""the entire government machinery should be held responsible for failing to tackle the problem."" the surrender of some alleged extremists in giridih district a few months ago was a ""political gimmick"" and suggested that instead of adopting oppressive measures the government should begin negotiations with the ultras. he alleged the government's assurances to conduct panchayat elections soon in the state was only a ""false propaganda."" on his party's programme, soren said jmm has launched a month-long padyatra all over the state to make the people aware of the government's all round failure. the party, he said, would stage demonstration in all district headquarters on november 2 to protest against the ""incompetent"" jharkhand government.

10,Govt mulls tax sops on donations to political parties,"new delhi: in a bid to make political funding transparent, the centre is considering various options including giving income tax exemption to corporate houses making donations through cheques to political parties. the other two options before the centre are resorting to the audit and accounting procedure prescribed for political parties in a british enacted law and putting into practice certain recommendations of the indrajit gupta committee regarding state funding of elections, law ministry sources said. ""the group of ministers (gom) headed by home minister l k advani on political funding has met couple of times and would meet shortly to finalise the minutes of the earlier meeting,"" they said. on the corporate donations, the sources said at present the companies are giving money to the political parties from their profits and almost all of it go unaccounted, thus, the amount of money that comes to play in election goes undetected. ""the gom is considering whether income tax exemption could be given to those corporate houses who give donations to political parties through cheques,"" they said. this would encourage the corporate houses to donate to parties in a transparent manner, they added. the law ministry sources said a stringent law enacted by britishers had put lot of checks on political parties for receiving donations and the government is considering taking its help while framing the new law on political funding. the gom is also considering the option of making it mandatory for the political parties to submit to the election commission details of the funding received by it on an yearly basis, the sources said. the gom in its next meeting would also take into account the recommendations of the indrajit gupta committee on electoral reforms, which had advocated state funding of political parties contesting elections. the sources said the government is considering the recommendations for state funding in kind rather than in cash. the manner and mode of funding of political parties during elections had been a controversial subject and many governments over the years had not been able to achieve any consensus to enact a law as no political party is willing to give details of the money it received from various sources, they said. sometime back, there had been controversy about political parties receiving foreign donations from dubious sources without accounting for them and a litigation had been on in the delhi high court whether it amounted to violation of foreign contribution regulation act (fcra), the sources said.

""i am happy and i will continue to work for the party,"" he said. asked if he would extend his support and cooperation to the new leader, patnaik quipped, ""if he needs my help."" the 47-year old new pcc chief, elected twice to the lok sabha in 1991 and 1996, is expected to arrive here towards the end of this month, party sources said. however, three senior party leaders hemananda biswal, giridhar gamang and k p singh deo described the move as a good one.

13,Sonia to visit Beas ahead of Punjab polls,"new delhi: congress president sonia gandhi is likely to visit the headquarters of the radhasaomi sect at beas in punjab next month. the trip is, however, yet to be cleared by the security agencies. ostensibly a visit to an eye camp organised by the sect every year and attended by lakhs of devotees, sonia trip is not without political undertones. the eye camp is held november 1-5 and the congress president has been invited by the organisers, congress leaders from punjab say. punjab is headed for elections next february and the congress is widely perceived to be on a come-back trail in the state. the trip, scheduled for november 4, has obviously been timed to coincide with the bjp's national executive at amritsar on november 2 and 3. beas is about 30 km from amritsar. sonia last visited the state last year when she also made a special trip to the golden temple. this time round, the visit comes in the midst of the congress party's hectic election campaign. the party is presently in the process of holding district-level election rallies. senior congress leaders hope the impact of the bjp's meet would be blunted with sonia's visit. at the same time, they say, it will provide another opportunity to sonia to shrug off the ``foreigner tag'' and reinforce her assimilation with the indian way of life. besides helping the party electorally, her spin doctors believe, such visits would appeal to hindu sensitivities at a time when the bjp has reopened the ayodhya issue in an obvious bid to consolidate its hindu vote bank in uttar pradesh, which is also headed for elections. earlier this year, sonia demonstratively participated in the mahakumbh at allahabad and taken a holy dip in the sangam. she also went to tirupati where she was not allowed darshan on the ground of being a foreigner. sonia stood her ground and was allowed in after she gave an undertaking that she was an indian. however, there are some in the party who think such symbolic gestures would not impact voting patterns. they recall how rajiv gandhi had launched his election campaign from faizabad with a promise that the congress would usher in ram rajya but to little avail.

14,Disinvestment in three companies finalised,"new delhi: claiming that tuesday's meeting of the cabinet committee on disinvestment (ccd) was ""one giant step forward"", arun shourie, minister for disinvestment, announced that the transaction document for hindustan zinc ltd (hzl), itdc and hotel corporation of india (hci) had been finalised. in hzl, the government will be selling 26 per cent of its stake. ""letters will be sent to bidders on wednesday,"" shourie said. in itdc's case, the ashoka hotels in delhi and bangalore will be given on a 30-year renewable lease while six other properties in agra, madurai, manali, bodh gaya, hasan and mahabalipuram will be sold. similarly, hci's properties in mumbai, delhi and rajgir will be sold along with its subsidiary chef air. according to shourie, while itdc had 97 bidders, hci had attracted 18 buyers. ccd also decided to stagger price bids for eight days in the case of itdc and five days for hci. ""we acceded to this request by bidders as this would help them arrange bank guarantees and other requirements,"" he explained. in case of hci's property in srinagar, shourie said ""there are certain issues which are being sorted out"". he refused to put any date to the sale of this property. however, he reiterated his earlier stand that proceeds from the hci sale would be put into air-india. the ccd also decided to continue with disinvestment in ibp and balmer lawrie along with restructuring. in ibp, said shourie, the buyer would have to invest rs 2,000 crore in the hydrocarbon sector, excluding investment in petrol pumps, within 10 years of the deal. the government has a 52.97 per cent stake in ibp, out of which 26 per cent will be divested. ""ibp will no longer be a marketing company. it can get into exploration also,"" he said. when shourie's attention was drawn to the securities appellate tribunal's dismissal of sebi's order barring sterlite from entering the capital market, he said: ""we are colour blind in applying guidelines. it will be applied mechanically. any bidder becomes eligible if it has got a stay or any order has been overturned."" shourie said that he hoped right progress was being made in the divestment in 13 psus. ""in case of one or two companies, the milestone might slip by a week but the overall time-table will not be affected,"" he said. bidders for bharat heavy plates and instrumentation india have asked for some time. shourie felt that the system of making the secretary of administrative ministry responsible for time-table adherence has proved effective.

15,Scholars discount `clash of civilisations' in India,"new delhi: muslim opinion-makers here have rejected the ``clash of civilisations'' scenario in the indian context, insisting that the country's social mosaic is too deep to be dented by any theory that the current conflict in afghanistan would overcome national borders to acquire civilisational dimensions. dealing with political scientist samuel p huntington's 1993 hypothesis that essential divisions in the post-cold war world are not among nations but among civilisations, muslims scholars here say india with its complex social fabric and unique cultural history defies such prospects. ``if you travel across rural india, you come across a rich socio-cultural mosaic which betrays no hints of any conflict,'' noted islamic scholar maulana wahiuddin khan says. the ``clash'' theory which has gained currency following the terrorist strikes in the us, khan believes, lacks a historical perspective. ``if sufi philosophy is the true expression of islam in india, then there is really no civilisational clash between hindus and muslims, that theory does not extend to india,'' he said. muslim women's forum convenor sayeeda hameed sees the us-afghan conflict more as a ``clash between the peoples who have and who do not have.'' terming india also as a nation of ``the have-nots of the world'', she wonders how the ``great digital divide is going to self-perpetuate.'' she feels one way out of the civilisational conundrum is to lay a major emphasis on the regional identity of south asia. noted political scientist ashis nandy, in fact, questions the adequacy of huntington's theory, claiming that it suffers from severe limitations. ``it is a bogus theory, western civilisation is not entirely autonomous, they used chinese discoveries,'' he remarks, observing that civilisations are never single entities. nandy claims that interesting civilisational overlaps in this part of the world point to a rejection of the theory. ``many muslim communities in india have closer affinities to hindus than to other muslim social groups,'' he observes, stressing that an attempt to separate them is unlikely to succeed. ``religion outside north america and europe does not have an exclusive meaning,'' he says, questioning the theory first published in the journal foreign affairs. he is emphatic that ``civilisational borderlines cannot be marked out.''

17,"UTI suffered Rs 5,000 cr loss on PSU investment","new delhi: disinvestment minister arun shourie on tuesday said that the country's largest mutual fund unit trust of india suffered a notional loss of over rs 5,000 crore on its investment in psu shares compared to what appreciation could have been made on similar investment in bank deposits. stating that uti invested rs 6,403 crore in psu shares, divested during 1991-92 to 1994-95, he told reporters the mutual fund earned a net profit of only rs 1,650 crore on this investment till now. ""value of such investment would have been rs 13,109 crore even at a compound interest rate (bank deposit rate) of 9 per cent per annum"" he said, pointing out that this reflected a net loss of rs 5,056 crore to uti as compared to bank deposit. giving a presentation on the government's decade long disinvestment programme, shourie said that minority sale of shares of even blue chip psus like indian oil corporation and videsh sanchar nigam were made at a maximum price earning ratio (price per share to earning per share) of six during 1991-92 to 1999-2000. in case of strategic disinvestment, the government sold balco for a p/e ratio of 19, while in case of cmc this figure was 12. he said that the government had realised a total of rs 1,128 crore through strategic sale in balco, modern food, cmc and hindustan teleprinters, and added that this could have given a return of rs 112.85 crore annually in fixed deposit, whereas dividend paid by these four psus averaged rs 7.26 crore in the last eight years.

18,It's a politically motivated case: Jogi,"raipur: chhattisgarh chief minister ajit jogi on tuesday decided to contest, politically and legally, the order of the national scheduled castes and tribes commission (ncscst) declaring that he was not a tribal. jogi has already moved a petition before the chhattisgarh high court, seeking contempt of court proceedings against ncscst chairman dilip singh bhuriya, a former congress mp from jhabua and now in the bjp. talking to times news network here, jogi said the congress had decided to extend full support to him as party president sonia gandhi felt the case was politically motivated. jogi has made the state chief secretary and principal secretary as respondents. the ncscst had directed them to cancel jogi's st certificate and file criminal cases against him. jogi counsel, a.m. singhvi, stated that the commission's orders were politically motivated as the petitioner, sant kumar netam, who had filed the case before the ncscst, was a bjp worker. after jogi moved a petition before the hc in bilaspur, chief justice w.a. shisak stayed the implementation of ncscst findings till further orders and directed the respondents, the ncscst chairman and the district magistrate of bilaspur, not to take any action against jogi. jogi said the ncscst had exceeded its brief as its findings were only advisory in nature. it could not take cases up against individuals. according to article 338 (5) of the constitution, the commission is expected to take up cases of general welfare of scs and sts, he added. on his status as a ``tribal'', jogi said the matter had been settled earlier by the indore hc bench on july 24, 1989, and the mp hc in jabalpur on april 27, 2001. the jabalpur hc had imposed a fine of rs 10,000 on the petitioner for filing frivolous cases. according to jogi, the ncscst should not have entertained the case as it has already been settled by two hc benches which confirmed his tribal identity. he also said the commission chairman conducted the proceedings alone without taking other members into confidence, and said that he passed an ex parte judgment too. bhuriya's action has been supported by jogi's opponents within the congress and the bjp. a group of anti-jogi congress leaders met on tuesday and decided to launch a campaign for his ouster from chief ministership. brijmohan agawral, bjp mla, demanded jogi's resignation. jogi had been facing a caste identity crisis since 1986 when he was made a rajya sabha member. at least 60 congress legislators and mps had filed a memorandum before then prime minister rajiv gandhi, challenging his tribal identity. during the assembly byelection in marwahi, this issue was the bjp's main poll plank, but jogi was elected by a thumping majority. earlier, he was elected to the lok sabha from raigarh, a tribal seat.

25,Infant's death in City Gold exposes political chinks,"ahmedabad: the death of 13-month-old agastya bhatt appears to have exposed political links in the city gold cine-multiplex, the mention of which were hitherto considered taboo since the earthquake. curiously, son of former state revenue minister vajubhai vala, bhavdeep, admitted publicly on tuesday that he had withdrawn his shares and resigned as director from the sujas members association of sujas entertainment which built city gold. vala's admission in a public notice published in all major newspapers is not merely incidental, coming as it does after the multiplex got caught in another whirlpool of controversy following the infant's death. agastya drowned in the 10 feet deep water sump located in the cine-multiplex premises last friday, but the family which is recovering from the trauma has not yet lodged a complaint with the police. what prompted vala to declare that he had resigned as director and shareholder from the city gold project three months after he submitted his resignation, (he claims to have resigned on july 2) is still a mystery. when contacted, bhavdeep vala denied that there was any connection between his declaration and the accident. ""it was necessary so that nobody misuses vajubhai's name to bring pressure in case a legal notice has to be served,"" he said. asked why he had withdrawn from the project, he said, ""i am building a multiplex right here in rajkot and find it difficult to come to ahmedabad all the time. moreover there were people bothering me for tickets and all that ... ,"" he confessed. but bhavdeep is clear that his business stakes in ahmedabad were only restricted to the theatre bit of city gold and nothing else. ""i am not interested in politics and my father is not involved in my business, just because i was friendly with sanjay agrawal (chimanbhai agrawal's son), i took this up,"" he said. chimanbhai agrawal flatly denied that there was negligence involved in the accident and added that ""vala's declaration of his resignation was long overdue."" denying that there was any political or business pressure on him, he said ""vala wanted to restrict himself to rajkot"". the navrangpura police station took cognisance of the incident by making an entry under 'accidental death' and is investigating into the case of agastya's death. meanwhile, the citizens council ahmedabad has written to the chief justice of the gujarat high court requesting his intervention in the matter. chairman hariprasad vyas and co-ordinator ranjit singh dhillon of cca have demanded that the owners of the complex be brought to book and the multiplex be closed down immediately. a similar letter has also been shot to the chief justice by the lokshahi suraksha sangathan, vijay mistry from the sangathan told tnn. police officials opine, ""it will be considered an accident unless proved otherwise."" incidentally, this is not the first accident in this premise after a painter suspended from a cord to touch up the multiplex's exterior, slipped to his death some six months back. today the police has evidence to prove that there was negligence on the part of the painting contractor involved ""since the cord had thinned at certain points and was already weak when the labourer was using it,"" said a police officer investigating the case.

26,Cong gears up for 'early' Assembly polls,"ahmedabad: the gujarat pradesh congress committee has formulated a strategy to gear up for a possible dissolution of the assembly and subsequent elections, as is being rumoured in political circles after narendra modi took over as chief minister. a meeting of the steering committee of the state congress, which was held at aicc general secretary kamal nath's residence on monday, deliberated on the need for the party to review its strategy in the event of changed political equations. to ensure discipline among its ranks, the leaders also decided to disqualify those who had already served two terms as dcc presidents. the committee also stressed on implementing the one-man-one-post principle effectively. the meeting was attended by gpcc president amarsinh chaudhary, madhavsinh solanki, ahmed patel, shankersinh vaghela and urmila patel. the congress, which was exuding confidence that chief minister modi would find it difficult to identify a 'safe' constituency to get elected within the mandatory six-month period, is now troubled with rumours that modi might be at a vantage point if the assembly is dissolved and polls held simultaneously with those in uttar pradesh. amarsinh said on tuesday that the bjp and the sangh parivar appeared to be raising the ramjanmabhoomi issue with the up elections in mind and this was an indication that it might choose to dissolve the gujarat assembly. chaudhary also alleged that the bjp government had not only made attempts to cancel the names of dedicated congress voters from the voters' list but was also ""avoiding registering of voters from certain areas"". he said the gpcc would appoint a high-powered committee to keep a tab on such attempts and would also send circulars till the taluka-level, directing the authorities to scrutinise the voters' list carefully. a campaign committee and publicity committee would also be constituted to plan for the assembly elections. the congress also decided to form a cell that would monitor the functioning of municipalities.
