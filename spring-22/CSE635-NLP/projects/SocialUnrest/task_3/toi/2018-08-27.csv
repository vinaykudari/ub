0,"Despite starvation, states fail to lift grains","new delhi: it's an oft-repeated lament by the centre that states don't seem to lift the foodgrains which are offered to them under the public distribution system (pds). the latest lament came from prime minister vajpayee himself who bemoaned that the off-take of foodgrains by the states remains poor. ironical as it may seem, the off-take by the states continues to remain dismal even as some of them battle drought and starvation and the government's godowns face a problem of plenty. last week, the centre as also the states found themselves being reminded by the supreme court about their responsibility to ensure that food reaches the hungry. particularly when the country has abundant foodgrains with 61,000 million tonnes of foodgrains available as against a buffer norm of 25,000 million tonnes. says union minister for consumer affairs and public distribution shanta kumar: ``it is the states which are to be blamed for their failure to lift food-grains."" the pds, he says, is ``the joint responsibility of the centre and the states."" the centre procures, stores and then distributes foodgrains to the states. and the centre is not lacking in this task. what is worrying for the centre, says kumar, is the fact that foodgrains offered to the state governments under the pds and other schemes is not lifted entirely by them. statistics speak for themselves. during april-may this year, of the total allocation of around 29.30 lakh tonnes of wheat to the states, the off-take was merely 9.11 lakh tonnes. in percentage terms, this comes to just about 31.12. bihar lifted a mere 11.8 per cent of the allocation while gujarat's off-take was 27 per cent. punjab had an off-take of just about 12 per cent while rajasthan fared slightly better with 26 per cent. even up had an off-take of only about 36 per cent. the story repeats itself where rice is concerned though the off-take at a total of 48 per cent was somewhat better. of the allocation of around 37.30 lakh tonnes to the states, just about half, 17.83 lakh tonnes, were lifted by the states. bihar lagged behind several others with just 7.8 per cent. uttar pradesh lifted 24 per cent while rajasthan took merely eight per cent of its rice allocation. the response wasn't any better from states in the grip of a drought. of the 22 lakh tonnes allocated to them, only 13 lakh tonnes had been lifted by them, says kumar. equally discouraging was the implementation of the annapurna scheme which provides for 10 kg of foodgrains free of cost to those aged above 65. curiously, at least six states ^ haryana, punjab, karnataka, madhya pradesh, tamil nadu and gujarat ^ have informed the centre that they are not implementing the scheme.

2,"Baywatch or ‘methi’ farm, ask Versova residents","mumbai: this is a novel case of bhaji on the beach where fresh fenugreek can be plucked out of the sands. but the save versova beach association (svba) is unimpressed. that's because the illegal methi (fenugreek) patches on the beach are proving an impediment in its campaign to spruce up the vandalised stretch of sand. these methi plots, cultivated by the residents of the sagar kutir slum, on the beach need to be removed before the association can proceed with its clean-up and beautification operation which the beach clearly needs. as an angry seven bungalows' oldtimer says as we walk around the place, versova beach could well win a spot in the guinness book of world records for being the only public beach that has slums, open-air toilets, methi patches, wells and tabelas with cattle milling around.'' however, as is the norm in this endlessly encroached city, the encroachers are refusing to clear out. what's more, the suburban collector and the bmc are taking no steps to restrain the cultivators, he adds. this, despite several requests from the svba as well as a high court order prohibiting any cultivation on the beach. naturally, the local greens are feeling distinctly frustrated. more so because they obtained the official sanction to beautify the beach in may last year after five years of lobbying with the authorities. all that they have managed to do since then is to build a protective wire fence around the mangroves on the beach. they have sponsors willing to fund the restoration of the rest of the beach, but cannot embark on the next phase of levelling and planting because of the methi plots and wells that dot the sands. is a beach meant for vegetable cultivation?'' asks usha kiran, a leading light of the svba. no. but mumbai is the land of the unimaginable,'' she adds. we understand that these slum- dwellers need to eke out a livelihood, but they cannot be allowed to cultivate crops on the beach. as it is, their sagar kutir slum has swallowed more than a quarter of the four-km-long beach,'' emphasises a local doctor, shalini deshpande, whose flat overlooks the beach. what's more, the slum is growing all the time, as several other oldtimers are at pains to highlight. that is all too evident at the beach: local women can be seen excavating sand and stuffing it into bags, while their men can be seen piling the bags one on top of another to lay the foundation of new houses on the beach. this is simply not on,'' asserts dr deshpande. the government assured the svba that the post-1995 slum-dwellers would be evicted and the pre-1995 ones would be rehabilitated under the srd scheme, but it had done nothing towards keeping this promise. worse, local politicians have recently been encouraging the slum-dwellers to carry on with their methi cultivation. that too, after the cultivators had stopped growing their crop (for nearly two years) after the high court order the svba obtained in 1997.'' this is confirmed by methi cultivator ram yadav. our local mla, baldev khosa, and even sunil duttsaab came to us and said that we could grow methi on the beach until we were provided with alternative land by the government. so we started the cultivation again. we need this crop, it fetches us a daily income of rs 150,'' says the 'bhaiya', as he draws sweet water out of a well on his plot. we have been doing this business for 30 years. it provides employment to dozens of sagar kutir's residents. we don't care whether it is legal or illegal,'' notes another cultivator. digging wells to source sweet water needed for the methi does ruin the beach,'' he acknowledges, but it is our livelihood.'' svba activists, however, insist that it is vital for the government to stop this vandalisation because the beach is the only large open public space available to about one million residents of andheri-versova. this is mumbai's most populous suburb, as the latest census will confirm, and its inhabitants desperately need a clean beach where they can get a breath of fresh air,'' says rahul berar. if the government stops this misuse of the beach and helps us restore it to the community, it will be doing a service to the entire suburb,'' adds pradeep chaudhary. when the problem is brought to his notice, capt s.k. jha, hydrographer-surveyor of the maharashtra maritime board, which is in charge of the state's coastline, says that he will survey the beach soon to study the situation. mumbai district suburban collector c.s. sangitrao is away in nagpur, but resident district collector milind shambarkar says that his office has reported the problems of versova beach to the state environment department and action will be taken soon. the svba certainly hopes so.

4,'Farooq should step down before polls',"jammu: people's democratic party (pdp) leader mufti mohammed sayeed on saturday asked chief minister farooq abdullah to step down from the top post before the next assembly elections in the state to ensure ""free and fair polls."" ""if farooq abdullah has the moral courage and actually enjoys as widespread support among the masses as he claims to (enjoy), he should not be afraid of quitting his post before elections.this would be a step in the right direction as free and fair elections may then become possible in the state,"" he said. mufti pointed out that even in that scenario, the elections would be held under central rule and the chief minister's party national conference (nc) was an alliance partner in the national democratic alliance (nda) government at the centre. the former union home minister pointed out that successive rigged elections in the state had contributed in no small measure in fomenting turmoil in jammu and kashmir. he said the people of the state were never allowed to exercise their franchise freely as happened in most parts of india and this has bred alienation and extreme cynicism in them. this has also eroded the kashmiris faith in indian democracy and farooq's stepping down before elections may contribute towards restoring this faith in some measure, the pdp president said. ""farooq abduallh should follow the example of the bangladesh pm. if it can happen in a weak democracy like bangladesh, why can't this be done in india to win back alienated people?"" he asked. referring to prime minister atal behari vajpayee's independence day address in which he promised ""free and fair polls in j&k,"" mufti said this clearly showed that the pm was now acutely aware of the manner in which rigged elections have vitiated the atmosphere in the state.

5,RPI will protest govt’s non-inclusion of caste in UN conferance,"mumbai: the republican party of india (athawale faction) would launch agitations in all state capitals from august 30 to protest the vajpayee-led nda government's decision not to include caste discrimination as a topic of discussion at the united nations' world conference against racial discrimination in south africa. addressing reporters here on saturday, rpi president ramdas athawale criticised the central government's decision to keep out caste discrimination from the world body's discussion, as it did not fall under the purview of racial discrimination. we oppose the idea of the nda government. in india, caste discrimination is worse than racial discrimination. and the world community should know about it'', he said. (pti) the party would also extend an invitation to south african leader nelson mandela to attend the party's second national convention to be held in new delhi in november, he said. lambasting the changes made by the nda government in the new education policy, mr athawale said the communal'' educational policy of the government would not only affect but would also damage the secular fabric of the country.

6,"Centre, state govt to finalise joint CNG proposal","new delhi: the centre and the city government will finalise on monday a joint proposal for submission before the supreme court to resolve the cng crisis in delhi. the officials will work out the details with supreme courts' amicus curie(friend of court) and solicitor general harish salve as a sequel to the meeting petroleum minister ram naik had with chief minister sheila dikshit and salve to work out ``broad contours'' of the proposal. ``the centre and the delhi government have agreed on broad parameters to reduce difference on the issue and work out a feasible solution. the same would be put before the amicus curie on monday,'' union petroleum minister ram naik said. besides the vehicles presently plying on cng, naik said, ``we can supply cng to only those vehicles that are likely to be registered by persons who have filed affidavits before the supreme court after placing firm orders.'' the present allocation of natural gas to indraprastha gas ltd is sufficient to meet the demand of cng vehicles that have been registered/converted up till now. but it would be difficult to supply cng to vehicles that may register in future, he said. naik said igl will double the dispensing capacity of the cng stations in delhi to 4.40 lakh kg per day from the present capacity of around 2.20 lakh kg per day by the end of next month. the number of cng stations would be increased from the present 74 to 87 by september 30, 2001. fourteen new compressors are being imported from argentina and italy to increase delivery. five of these have already arrived while nine are being airlifted, naik said. five of the 14 new compressors would be for delhi transport corporation buses, taking the number of dedicated cng stations for dtc buses to nine. ``this will reduce the problem substantially,'' he said, adding 50 petrol and diesel retail outlets have been identified for setting up cng dispensing stations. naik, however, said the overall availability of the natural gas at the national level is not likely to improve in the near future and there were supply side constraints for meeting demand of new vehicles that may register. against the allocation of 0.15 million cubic metres per day, delhi's present cng requirement is around 0.516 mcmpd. in case the trend of conversion of private vehicles also to cng mode continues, the total requirement of cng by june 2002 would touch 2 mcmpd. to meet this demand, gas allocation for cng supply in delhi has to be increased by over 12 times from the existing allocation, naik said. ``alternatively, we would request the supreme court to allow use of unleaded and low benzene petrol and ultra low sulphur diesel in euro-ii compliant vehicles as they are also clean fuels,'' he said. besides, the government has also allowed lpg to be used as an automobile fuel and 220 sites across the country have been identified for setting up lpg dispensing stations, he said.

7,Centre to provide foodgrains to Bihar,"patna: the centre has decided to provide one lakh tonne of foodgrains to the flood and drought-affected people of bihar. an announcement in this regard would shortly be made by prime minister atal bihari vajpayee. this information was given by radha mohan singh, mp and chairman of the regional advisory board of the food corporation of india (fci), at a press conference on friday. ironically, the bihar government has not been able to lift the free of cost foodgrains from the fci godowns under the centrally-sponsored midday meal scheme. according to data provided by the fci, the bihar government has lifted only 8,303 tonnes of wheat against the allotted 2,15,280 tonnes and 5,590 tonnes of rice against the allotted 1,21,416 tonnes in 1999-2000. during 2000-2001, the state government lifted only 15.05 per cent of the total allotted wheat (1,59,024 tonnes) and 49.49 per cent of the total allotted rice (65,364 tonnes). singh said the centre has the requisite stocks of foodgrains and it wants to cooperate with the bihar government in this regard. he said that the bihar government is yet to send its requisition for the allotment of foodgrains under the antyodaya scheme which was implemented by the centre on december 25, 2000. the state government has not even initiated the process to issue cards to the beneficiaries, he added. singh further said that the bihar government has also failed to reap the benefits of several centrally-sponsored schemes for those living below the poverty line. according to data, out of the total allotted 12,36,960 tonnes of wheat and 8,24,640 tonnes of rice in 2000-2001, the bihar government lifted only 5,01,166 tonnes of wheat and 1,45,577 tonnes of rice from the fci godowns. similar is the fate of the centrally-sponsored schemes meant for those living above the poverty line. singh said that barring bihar, 15 states and three union territories have so far successfully implemented the antyodaya scheme. he said the centre is ready to cooperate with the bihar government in this regard. singh said that the centre has also decided to implement a new scheme ""jagriti shivir yojana"". he said that a district-level committee will be constituted in each state and the concerned district magistrate will be its ex-officio secretary. the local mps, mlas and chairmen of the district boards will be the members of such committees, he added.

10,Grain merchants protest levy on rice,"baroda: grain merchants are on an indefinite strike from from monday to protest gujarat government's decision to levy cess on rice, according to baroda grain merchant's association (bgma). ""the strike is in response to the statewide call for agitation given by merchant's state-level body"", a bgma spokesman said, even as the central gujarat chamber of commerce (cgcc) president, bhupendra patel, said the chamber also supported the strike. the grain merchants had challenged in the high court the state government notification issued on september 26, 2000 which had included rice in the list of items under the agriculture produce marketing committee rules of 1963. ruling in favour of the merchants, the high court had said rice is not an agriculture produce. it is a secondary item because it is made after processing and paddy hence attracts no cess, it had held. patel charged that the notification proved that ""the state government could overrule even the high court's order and take decisions favouring a certain sections whenever it wants to"". patel has sought a meeting with the state chief minister keshubhai patel to discuss the matter.

12,SP youth protest against BJP policies,"allahabad: youth brigade activists of the samajwadi party on monday held a protest demonstration at the district collectorate against various policies of the bjp government and handed over a memorandum addressed to the governor to the district magistrate. the activists were demanding scrapping of english language and protesting against the atrocities being meted out to cattle owners of the district. on the occasion, the activists also blackened the registration number plates of official vehicles whose numbers were written in english. addressing the gathering, dharmendra yadav accused the bjp government of being anti-people which was acting against the interest of students, minorities, farmers, women and employees. city president of the sp, mushtaq ahmed kazmi while lambasting the gathering stated it was for the first time that the farmers were being forced to commit suicide owing to policies of the state government. terming the incidents as unfortunate, kazmi criticised the police excesses in ramkola, padrauna, jaunpur, babatpur and meerut. he alleged, the move of increasing the fee in colleges was basically initiated to scuttle the education prospects of the havenots. president of the yuvjan sabha, yogesh chandra yadav and district president of youth brigade abdul salman jointly criticised the bjp government for its failure to provide adequate supply of water and power to the citizens. ridiculing the government policies in this regard, the duo questioned the moral ground of the bjp continuing in power. another youth leader manoj chowdhury condemned the government for being unable to implement the recommendations of the fifth pay commissions on the state government teachers. commenting on the issue of liberalisation, the bjp government again came in for criticism from the sp activists for its move of bringing in 715 foreign products. the leaders said the bjp was bent upon creating english raaj under the garb of promoting indian culture.

13,Hussainsagar turns ‘suicidesagar’,"hyderabad: the hussainsagar which was built to serve as a source of drinking water is slowly turning into 'suicidesagar'. on an average one body is recovered from the lake every third day. according to the records available with the saifabad and ramgopalpet police stations, which have jurisdiction over the lake area from two directions, 43 people ended their lives by jumping into the lake so far this year. last year, the number was 89, while in 1999, it was 118. the suicides in the lake are posing problems to the police.while it is difficult to establish the identity of the highly decomposed bodies, police are also having to spend some money from their pocket towards retrieving the dead from the lake. the saifabad and ramgopalpet police spend about rs 400 on the retrieval and transport of each dead person.while rs 200 is paid as charges to people who retrieve the dead from the lake, another rs 200 is paid towards transportation charges and payment of 'mamool' to the mortuary staff. the government gives rs 150 as expense for retrieving a body from the lake but the police say it is insufficient. when a body is found in the lake, the police register a case under suspicious death (u/s 174 of ipc) and alter the sections if the autopsy report reveals the cause of death. in one such incident, saifabad inspector a venkataratnam said, the body of srinivas, a resident of sircilla was retrieved from the lake on july 4. the autopsy report revealed that srinivas was killed and his body dumped in the lake to cover up the crime. police investigations found that srinivas was done to death by his friend nagaraju to settle personal scores. venkataratnam said the department had a proposal to recruit few of the locals as home guards for they often help the police personnel in retrieving the dead from the lake.

14,Bihar govt ill-equipped to control malaria menace,"patna: despite the outbreak of malaria in an epidemic form in several villages falling under haveli kharagpur sub-division of munger district two months back, the bihar government is yet to gear up its machinery to implement the national anti-malaria programme (namp) in the state. out of the 3,322 sanctioned posts in various categories under the programme, 987 posts are lying vacant for past several months. they included the lone post of state entomologist, two posts of assistant entomologist, one post of zonal malaria officer, 14 posts of district malaria officer, 22 posts of assistant malaria officers and 15 posts of malaria inspectors. according to a report prepared by the directorate of namp, 354 posts of laboratory technicians, 117 posts of surveillance inspectors, 201 posts of basic health workers, four posts of insect collectors, 47 posts of basic health inspectors, 48 posts of field workers, three posts of surveillance inspectors, 30 posts of clerk, 17 posts of motor mechanic, 26 field workers, 9 posts of sweepers, 31 posts of drivers, 18 peons and one post of superintendent-cum-accountant are also lying vacant. with 92 percent of the health budget being spent by the government to meet the establishment expenditure leaving only 8 percent to execute the development works, the health department is not in a position to even initiate measures to fill up these vacant posts. while admitting that the government was unable to fill up the vacant posts under namp posts due to resource crunch, a top official of the health department said that even if the entire plan fund for the current financial year was released to the department it would still fall short by about rs 20 crore of its actual requirement. the official, however, said the department has decided to establish ""malaria control society"" both at the state and district level shortly. let alone filling up the vacant posts, the health department is yet to start the spray of ddt in the malaria prone areas even as 611 cases of malaria had been reported between january and april. the report said that between june 26 and july 3 this year 375 blood samples were collected through mass survey of which 22 were turned out to be cases of plasmodium vivax and 6 turned out to be cases of plasmodium falciparum. the namp directorate said it is yet to receive the annual report for the year 1999 from the bihar govt. the poor reporting system had made it difficult for the namp to keep a watch on the malaria situation which prevailed in the state, the report said. the report described the surveillance system as poor. the delay in the spray of ddt is surprising since the centre had on june 11 released rs.70 lakh to the state government under modified kala-azar control programme to meet the operational cost of the ddt spray.the centre also supplies the ddt. the fund is, however, yet to be made available to the all the 34 kala-azar affected districts. so far it had been undertaken in only 8 districts. the health department official said that the ddt spray in all the kala-azar affected districts would reduce the incidence of malaria to a great extent.

15,"ADM booked for challan of 200 trucks, tractors","kanpur: vijay narayan sengar a senior lawyer of kanpur court on monday charged the adm finance, kanpur nagar, with tarnishing the image of the state government by his acts. in a fax massage sent to chief minister raj nath singh, sengar, who was former district president of the bjp, said that the adm finance had seized more than 200 trucks and tractors loaded with morang without going through the provisions of the mines and mining act. as a result, the rates of morang had not only doubled in the city but this move had paved the way for easy extortion of money by the police. he said that what was even more surprising was the fact that the adm finance chose not to inform the chief mining officer of this move. according to section 9 of the act, royalty could be realised at the place of mining and there was no bar in holding it. morang was being mined in hamirpur district not in kanpur. hence, the adm finance, kanpur nagar, had no right to realise the royalty.
