0,"Burying skeletons, the govt way","NEW DELHI: This is one skeleton that refuses to remain buried. A late Harappan skeleton was found in Narela eight years ago, but the Delhi Government buried it right back, claiming they did not have the means to preserve it.

But six years later, conscience-smitten, they decided to lay it at the National Museum''s door, but the latter won''t have any of it.

Nita Bali, secretary, art, language and culture department, Delhi government, defends the decision to re-bury the skeleton. ""This was because we did not have the resources to preserve the skeleton, our experts said it would be better preserved if it were reburied,"" she says.

However, B D Chattopadhyaya, professor of ancient Indian history at JNU, feels the Delhi Government could have done better than turn ostrich. ""The department could have got the skeleton examined by the Deccan college in Pune, the ASI''s paleontology department or even archaeology experts at Allahabad University,"" he says. Even now, the options are open, he says, if the National Museum does not want the historical treasure.

Bali does admit: ""The skeleton is of great historical importance and was found with some other artifacts of the same period, it is a shame that it remained buried for eight years."" But how did the skeleton come out of the department''s closet? About two years ago, says Bali, ""I was on a routine visit to the state museum when I saw the mould of the skeleton."" Enquiries revealed the original had been reburied due to ''lack of resources''.

Now repeated requests to the National Museum to take over the skeleton are being ignored. ""We plan on sending one letter every week on the issue,"" says Bali.

However, Director-general, museums, ASI, Hari Manjhi says his department has not received any such request. But the Delhi Government has copies of the letters it has sent the museum.

Meanwhile, the Delhi Government isn''t revealing where it buried its treasure â€“ after a stratigraphical dating showed it belonged to the late Harappan era. ""We''re afraid someone might desecrate the skeleton,"" Bali explains.

2,Ban on crackers after 10 pm goes for a six,"PATNA: It was a new and somewhat sad experience of an indoor Diwali for the people of Patna this year as the rain god played a spoilsport. But the ban imposed on the use of firecrackers after 10 in night went for a six on Saturday with the authorities looking the other way.

The sky over the city, which normally shines with colourful lights of â€œrocketsâ€� and other fire displays on the Diwali night, was less glittery on Saturday. The sound of high-power â€œbombsâ€� also got subdued in the rain. â€œIn the last 40 years that I can remember, I have not seen a Diwali like this. We had clouds and fogs but we never had rain,â€� said Sitaram Jha, a retired professor of Patna University.

The helplessness of children and also of adults in several households was to be seen to be believed. Sanjay Shukla, his wife Aparna and their four-year-old daughter Jaya of Pataliputra Colony kept waiting for the rain to stop till they finally went to sleep, depressed. â€œOur celebrations ended much before it does every Diwali. We could not put diyas and candles and had to remain content with series bulbs,â€� said Anuradha Singh, another housewife. The celebrations in the Singhsâ€™ family might have ended early, but revellers went on lighting crackers till late after midnight.

â€œThe quantity was less but the duration was not short,â€� said a resident of the Boring Road area. â€œThe rain did not stop people from using crackers till 2 am in my area even though it was on a smaller scale,â€� Kumar Ravi of Indrapuri said.

What happened was that the people kept wishing and hoping that the rain would stop by the evening. Many optimistic children pestered their parents to go to the market for buying firecrackers and other items. â€œAll these crackers were used by revellers till the wee hours,â€� explained Ritu Jaiswal, a housewife.

â€œI could sell crackers worth only Rs 10,000 though I had bought a consignment of Rs 60,000 keeping in view the last yearâ€™s trend,â€� said a visibly upset Sanjeet, who puts up a cracker stall in the Kidwaipuri area every Diwali as a part-time business. â€œMain to barbad ho gaya,â€� he rued, pooh-poohing the suggestion that the crackers could be sold during Chhath or next Diwali.

According to him, Chhath does not see any brisk sale of crackers. â€œThe crackers have turned soggy due to wet weather conditions, and if we dry them for sale next Diwali, the colours on the package would fade,â€� he stated.

In many areas, cracker shops remained open on Sunday. â€œI still have goods worth Rs 10,000 left,â€� said Mohammad Ejaz of Raja Bazaar who sold items at â€œthrowawayâ€� prices on Diwali. â€œLast year, I made a profit of up to Rs 15 on each unit. This year it was up to Rs 4,â€� he said sadly.

3,Vatal gears up for long stir against govt,"BANGALORE: Former Border Areas Commission chairman Vatal Nagaraj on Sunday said the state government had failed in addressing the problems of Kannadigas in the border areas and announced a year-long Kannada Jaagruti (Kannada awareness) agitation from November 1.

Speaking to reporters here, Nagaraj said: ""The interim report that I gave the government is gathering dust even as Kannadigas in 70 border taluks continue to languish due to neglect. To protest this, we will hold seminars, rasta and rail rokos and picketing for a whole year from Rajyothsava day (November 1).""

This is the 47th year since the unification of Karnataka, but an emotional unity among the people of the state had not yet been achieved due to the discriminatory attitude of every government since then.

""The people of Kodagu and North Karnataka feel that they are of no importance to the state because their areas have not received any attention at all. This government set up the Nanjundappa committee to look into regional disparity, but that report is also gathering dust,"" he rued.
