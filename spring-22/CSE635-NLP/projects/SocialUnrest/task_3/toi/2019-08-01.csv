0,Hanspal selection rebuff for CM’s detractors,"CHANDIGARH: Appointment of the Namdhari leader and former Rajya Sabha member H S Hanspal as the Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee president is less of a personal victory for Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh and more of a rebuff to his detractors in the party.

After ensuring victory of the party at the hustings and forming government, it was evident that chief minister Amarinder Singh would have to quit the coveted post of the partyâ€™s state unit considering the partyâ€™ policy of â€˜â€˜one man one postâ€™â€™.

However, Amarinder continued to hold the dual charge of the chief ministership and party chief for more than five months as the party high command was anxious to let him settle down and ensure the partyâ€™s victory in the corporations and Panchayat Samiti and Zila Parishad elections. And as party president he successfully wrested the control of four corporations and all the Zila Parishad and Panchyat Samitis in the state.

Having consolidated his hold both over the party and the government, and eager to forge ahead with his anti-corruption campaign, Amarinder wisely decided it was time for him to step down as Punjab Congress chief to concentrate fully on the statecraft. Hanspal turned out to be the perfect choice for him as he wanted a weak president who would toe his line and not one who would create hurdles. The idea was to show dissidents who is the real boss.

Bereft of mass base, Hanspal is a lightweight politician who has neither devoted supporters nor enemies in the party. He has influence over Namdharis (the community to which he belongs) who are concentrated in Malerkotla and can affect electoral fortunes in only one assembly segment.

The mild-mannered Hanspal is a good negotiator and is said to have clinched the CPI alliance with Congress in the assembly elections early this year.

Put together, Hanspal was just the man Amarinder needed as a counterweight to his detractors who had been lobbying hard for Lok Sabha MP from Ropar (SC) Shamsher Singh Dullo, a combative politician who had been close to the late Beant Singh.

Since the chief minister Amarinder Singh was a Jat Sikh, Dulloâ€™s supporters had been selling â€˜â€˜dalit card.â€™â€™ (The state has 30 per cent dalit population.). What had gone against Dullo was that he had been indicted by Lokpal, a serious handicap for a party which is flaunting its crusade against corruption.

But all said and done Hanspal may not, after all, prove a strong party boss especially as the party is facing a tough challenge from the Akalis who have been hurt by Amarinder Singhâ€™s anti-corruption campaign. However, in the end the success of Hanspal as the PPCC chief will depend on the support he would get from Amarinder and his government.

1,State police go on arrest spree,"KOLKATA: Swapan Lodh of Regent Park and Chhotka of Jadavpur and hundreds of others had managed to elude the law even with charges of extortion, rape, robbery and murder against them.

Their luck finally ran out when in a series of raids conducted simultaneously throughout the state and four GRP areas on Tuesday and Wednesday, the West Bengal police arrested a staggering 7,160 persons including Swapan, Chhotka and other dreaded killers.

However, the list provided by the police left a few questions unanswered including whether any of those picked up were political detainees. â€œOn Tuesday and Wednesday we launched combing operations across the state picking up 7,160 men and women.â€�

â€œA total of 1965 persons had arrest warrants against them of whom 481 had specific cases of robbery, rape, murder and arson pending against their name,â€� state Inspector General of Police (Law and Order) Chayan Mukherjee said on Wednesday.

Mukherjee further said that 4,713 of those arrested were taken into custody as a preventive measure. He, however, did not say why the â€˜preventiveâ€™ arrests were made. Nor did he elaborate on whether any of the arrested were political detainees.

A cursuory look at the break-up of the list revealed that 482 of those arrested had neither cases pending against them, nor included in the list of â€˜preventive arrests.â€™

â€œAltogether 53 fire arms,most of them locally produced but carbon copies of sophisticated foreign firearms,were recovered from the. Along with this 67 rounds of ammunition, 114 live bombs, two choppers and Rs 14,164 was recovered from them,â€� he said.

The police also seized 11,337 litres of country liquor. South 24 Parganas topped the list in both number of criminals as well as quantity of arms and drugs seized.

While more than 1,400 were arrested from the district, 22 kg ganja and 2,600 litres of country liquor were seized from them, district superintendent of police D.K Ganguly told TNN.

2,Left to oppose TMC bandh,"KOLKATA: The ruling Left Front will oppose the bandh called by the Trinamul Congress supremo Mamata Banerjee in protest against Union cabinetâ€™s nod to eastern railways bifurcation on August 5, declared former chief minister Jyoti Basu on Wednesday.

However, the LF is also opposed to the Centreâ€™s ratification of railway minister Nitish Kumarâ€™s moves and will hold a protest rally which would start at Brigade parade ground on August 11.

Finding Mamata cornered, CPM state secretary Anil Biswas chose to rub it in. â€œWhy has she decided to abstain from the vote for the vice-presidential election ? People will trust her only if she comes out of NDA and vote for the Opposition candidate in Parliament,â€™â€™ Biswas quipped.

â€œThere is no question of a joint movement on rail issue till then,â€� he said. According to him, the CPM overtures to Trinamul MP Ranjit Panja in AIIMS Delhi poll was more an â€˜individualâ€™ case.

While lambasting the NDA government for pursuing â€˜ruinousâ€™ policy for narrow political gains on rail issue, both Basu and Biswas accused Mamata of provincialism in the same breath. â€œThis is not a West Bengal Vs Bihar problem but affects Jharkhand and other states too.â€�

3,Trinamul calls Bengal bandh on August 5,"KOLKATA: Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday called a 24-hour Bangla bandh on August 5 in protest against the Eastern Railway bifurcation.

She also threatened that her party would abstain from voting in the vice-presidential election on August 12 if the bifurcation decision is not revoked by then.

Instead of casting their votes, she and other Trinamul MPs would sit in a dharna outside the Prime Ministerâ€™s residence, she said, after a meeting of the party working committee here. The working committee would meet again on August 13 in Delhi to take a final decision on quitting the NDA.

Mamata is anticipating that the NDA would fall short of the required numbers to elect their candidate to the post of vice-president. â€œIf they (the NDA) require the votes of our MPs to get their candidate elected as vice-president, let the Centre accept our demand,â€� she said.

She also announced a series of agitation, including the bandh call, in West Bengal against the Centreâ€™s decision till August 12. Significantly, she was silent on requesting for support from other political parties on August 5.

The Trinamul chief reiterated that the Trinamul had agreed to support an NDA government led by Vajpayee. â€œNow, we doubt if the Prime Minister is being allowed to function. We want him to assert himself,â€� she said.

However, the party has decided to give the NDA some more time after a telephone call from the Prime Ministerâ€™s Office. â€œVijay Goel called up on Wednesday and requested us to wait for some more time. The decision to wait was taken unanimously by the working committee,â€� she claimed.

But she did not sound convincing enough. Observers said she deferred her decision to break away from the NDA for a few more days. On the demands by other states for railway bifurcation, Mamata maintained she was against any move that harmed the countryâ€™s unity.

â€œIn 1981, the review committee proposed creation of only four new zones and bifurcation of ER or SER was not involved. Even in 1996, the separation of Dhanbad and Mughalsarai from ER was not planned,â€� she said, adding that she would demand the return of Dhanbad and Katihar divisions to the railways headquartered in West Bengal.

4,"LJP, NCP plan joint agitation against govt","PATNA: Both the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) have decided to launch joint agitations in the state for the redressal of peopleâ€™s grievances.

Talking to mediapersons here on Wednesday, LJP president Ram Vilas Paswan said that members of his party and that of the NCP would tour the flood-affected districts of the state on August 9 and 10 and sit on dharna at the district and block headquarters on August 12. NCP leaders Jagannath Mishra and Tariq Anwar were also present.

Paswan said in view of the present flood in some parts and drought in some other parts of the state, he had postponed his â€œVikas Rath Yatraâ€� scheduled to begin from August 9. Mishra said that so far, 150 people had lost their lives in the current flood, which had affected 1.25 crore people in 16 districts.

â€œThere is no stock of foodgrain in the affected districts, while no relief is being sent to the affected people due to disruption of road and rail communications. Even the families of the deceased are not getting compensation from the government. In the last 12 years, none of the 302 vulnerable points at the embankments has been strengthened.

No boat was constructed, nor the boatmen have been paid their dues,â€� he stated, and demanded immediate Central intervention to provide relief.

On the ongoing PMC strike, Paswan said instead of paying them, the government had invoked ESMA against them. He claimed that four PMC employees had so far died of starvation, adding that full payment of salary should be given to them.

5,All-party meet on Jharkhand domicle issue may be a flop,"NEW DELHI/RANCHI: Expressing serious concern over the loss of life and property in the wake of implementation of the domicile policy in Jharkhand, the Centre has directed the state government to maintain law and order â€œat all costâ€�.

Making a statement in Lok Sabha on Wednesday, minister of state for home I D Swamy said â€œnobody should be permitted to take law in his own hands and disrupt peace in the state.â€� Meanwhile, the all-party meeting on the domicile issue called by the chief minister Babulal Marandi on Thursday is likely to turn into a one-party meet as major opposition parties have decided to boycott it.

The Jharkhand Mukti Morcha had initially supported the governmentâ€™s domicile policy but has now accused the government of adopting double standards and trying to dilute the policy. BJP national vice president Kailashpati Mishra indicated that anybody who settled here as recently as in the 90s would also be considered a local.

This was a major shift from the governmentâ€™s notification defining the last survey of record of right of land as proof of being a local, said Stephan Marandi, leader of the opposition. RJD MLA Girinath Singh also announced the partyâ€™s decision to boycott the meeting. The Congress was yet to decide whether it would attend the meeting or not.

Earlier on Tuesday, the Jharkhand High Court asked the state government to file counter-affidavits within 10 days in connection with the PIL challenging the domicile policy of the Jharkhand government.

A division bench comprising Chief Justice V K Gupta and Justice Tapan Sen referred the case to a full bench comprising five judges given the significance of the case while fixing August 19 as the next date of hearing.

6,Woman arrested in Kamalia murder case,"PATNA: â€œShe loved him, felt rejected and got him killed.â€� That, in a nutshell, is the outcome of the police investigation into the much publicised murder case of city businessman Manoj Kamalia.

At a press conference here on Wednesday, senior SP Sunil Kumar and city SP O N Bhaskar confirmed the arrest of Afsa Anzim, commercial tax officer, currently posted at Hajipur. She has been arrested on the basis of a statement made by Suraj Kumar alias Surja, an accused in the case, before a judicial magistrate under Section 164 of the Cr PC.

Anzim, who is unmarried, too was presented before mediapersons at the press conference. However, she continued to cry: â€œMain ismein nahin hun. Fansaya Gaya hai. (I am not involved. I have been framed.)â€�

According to SSP Kumar, Anzim came close to Kamalia at the time of her posting in Patna City in 1996. Shortly before his murder, Kamalia was planning to sever all ties with Patna and shift his business to some other place.

â€œBetween April 1 and April 17, they had conversations on the mobile phone at least on 125 times,â€� Kumar said. â€œAnzim was talking to Kamalia on his mobile (number 9835030088) even at the time of his murder,â€� Kumar added.

The SSP maintained that both had spent more than an hour roaming around Hotel Maurya in the evening just a day before Kamalia was killed.

Quoting the confessional statement of Surja, Kumar added that Anzim had visited the house of one notorious criminal, Sultan Mian, in the company of one Maulvi three or four days before Kamaliaâ€™s murder. Both Maulvi and Anzim made a proposal before Sultan Mian to kill Manoj Kamalia and offered him Rs 4 to 5 lakh. After two days, Anzim again met Sultan along with Maulvi and handed over Rs 1 lakh in the presence of Suraja.

Later, Sultan Mian, Chhotaka Santosh, Sunil and Suraja went to Patna City to identify Manoj. They gathered information about his daily routine, which included a visit to Mangal Talab for playing badminton.

On April 17, all the four criminals reached the Hitaishi Pustakalaya on two vehicles. Surja disclosed that Kamalia was killed by a bullet fired by Sultan. After killing Manoj, they all returned to the house of Sultan.

The senior SP added that Surja has already identified Anzim, who met Sultan for killing Manoj. However, he said the police are yet to identify Maulavi.

The police first suspected the involvement of notorious criminals as 0.45-bore pistol was used for killing Kamalia.

According to Kumar, Surja was arrested following an encounter with the police at the Maujhimpur village under the Fatuha police station of the Patna district on July 29. Another dreaded criminal Ajoy Kumar Pandit was killed in the same encounter, the SSP said. The other accused â€” Sultan Mian, Chhotaka Santosh and Sunil â€” are absconding.

About the involvement of Khalid Mian, at present lodged in the Siwan jail, City DSP Arvind Gupta said he was suspected to be involved in the conspiracy to kill Kamalia and the police are trying to gather evidence in this regard.

7,Gram sevaks peeved with govt over GOs,"HYDERABAD: The state government appears to be in a hurry to issue GOs without studying the implications, allege the Gram Sevaks Association.

According to D Rajalingam, the president of the association, the government in the recent past had issued a number of GOs which had led to controversies and agitation by gram sevaks. Talking to reporters on Wednesday, he said the latest in the order was GO 292 which would adversely affect about 55,000 gram sevaks in the state.

GO 292 makes it mandatory for gram sevaks to get clearance from the panchayat raj secretary before drawing their salaries. The association feels that this would lead to avoidable complications.

Gram sevaks are supposed to be part-time employees, but have been working full time, drawing an honorarium. Transferring them to the panchayat department would add to their woes, he said. The government had issued yet another GO no. 292 which puts them at the mercy of the panchayat department. It demanded that the government withdraw GO 292 and restore status quo.

8,YSR exposes govt’s irrigation schemes,"CUDDAPAH: Tall claims of the government of improving irrigation facilities in the state by taking up new projects stand belied in the face of problems encountered by farmers of Cuddapah district due to the non-completion of the Gandikota reservoir.

Works on the Gandikota reservoir, a part of the ambitious Galeru-Nagari project aimed at mitigating the thirst of the perennially drought-prone Rayalaseema region, are yet to commence even after six years of laying its foundation stone. The foundation stone was laid by chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu amid much fanfare. His bete noire Y S Rajasekhara Reddy was also present on that day.

Six years later, a visit to the project site reveals nothing more than a dilapidated foundation stone on the banks of a canal constructed as part of the project during the Congress regimes. According to a small group of farmers, government had acquired 14 acres of their land more than three years ago but so far it had not paid them any compensation. Same is the case with some other farmers in whose fields the department dug up trial pits for testing the reservoir capacity before undertaking the works.

What is worse in this case is that the government had dug up the fields rendering them uncultivable without acquiring them or paying compensation for the damage. Rajasekhara Reddy accompanied by legislators M V Mysoora Reddy, N Varadarajulu Reddy and several Congress leaders from the district visited the project site on Wednesday.

Calling it as expose of governmentâ€™s indifference towards solving peopleâ€™s problem, Rajasekhara Reddy said, â€œThis is one of the standing monuments of the unfulfilled promises by the chief minister in the region. The foundation stone was laid on February 29, 1996. This proves that the foundation stone was just an election promise to garner votes,â€� he said.

Reiterating that the Gandikota project was only one among several such promises made by Naidu in different districts, Rajasekhara Reddy said that the Congress was only trying to educate the people and create awareness among them about the unkept promises.

Reddy symbolically planted seven plants at the Gandikota project site to commemorate the seventh year of foundation stone laying, and asked the farmers to take care of the trees, besides adding one more tree every year to see how long would the government take to take up the project works.

10,Naik rules out change in petro prices,"NEW DELHI: State-owned oil retailing companies would not alter prices of petrol and diesel this fortnight as prices in the international markets had stabilised, Petroleum Minister Ram Naik said on Thursday.

""For the third successive fortnight, oil companies are not increasing prices of petrol and diesel. This is because international prices have stabilised and we hope the trend would continue in the future,"" Naik said here.

In accordance with the mechanism evolved by oil companies to review prices every fortnight after dismantling of administered pricing mechansim (APM), IndianOil, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum reviewed the prices of motor spirit (petrol) and high speed diesel (HSD) and had decided not to increase them as they were almost at import parity, he said.

12,Cong sends questionaire to Marandi on domicile policy,"RANCHI: After three days of delebrations on the domicile issue, the Congress on Thursday sent a questionaire to Chief Minister Babulal Marandi asking him to clarify how those who had settled in Jharkhand since 1947 could get job benefits.

""Adivasis and moolvasis should get benefits as their contribution is immense. At the same time, people who have settled here since 1947 should not be deprived of benefits,"" AICC secretary Subodhkant Sahay told reporters.

He also cricised the BJP led NDA government in the state for blaming Congress MLAs for allegedly instigating the July 24 violent bandh.

""Wits and power of the government have gone bankrupt, so it is blaming us to cover its failure on all fronts,"" Sahay alleged.

The Congress which started its meeting on Wednesday ran into rough wather with a section of leaders going against the domicile policy while officiating president Pradeep Kumar Balmuchoo said he was interested to attend today''s all-party meeting till last night. The party, however, did not participate in the meeting.

15,EC faces barrage of arguments against polls,"VADODARA: A plethora of arguments pitched against conducting early polls in riot affected areas, today rained down on the three-member election commission (EC) team, during its visit here on Thursday. The team, is in Gujarat since Wednesday to assess the situation before deciding on a date for the polls. The team also visited Chhota Udepur.

From housewives performing their daily chores, to offices-goers and persons in the marketplace-the members met a cross section of people gauging opinions regarding polls being held in the state.

The commission first met senior officials representing the district administration as well as the city and rural police. Later in the day commission paid their visits to the riot-affected areas in Fatehgunj, Kishanwadi, Yakurpura, Raja-Rani Talav, Wadi, Maneja, Maretha and Makarpura.

While the members refused to divulge with their observations. Those whom the team approached were clear regarding what they wanted. Rejecting the call for early polls, Hanif Sheikh, a resident of Fatehgunj told the team, ""The situation is still tense. ''Yahan rehne ka sukoon nahin, filhal election nahin hona chahiye'' (There is no peace of life, the polls should not be conducted now).""

Haji Inamdar, of Fatehgunj, said that several persons had suffered during the riots and it would not be advisable to hold polls. ""We lost a young boy in our family during the riots. Why would we vote in such a situation?"" questioned Naseem Bano.

More was in store for the representatives when they went to the Raja-Rani Talav area in Panigate. Members of the Anjuman-E-Imdad-E-Bahami (AIB) alleged that a relief camp that the representative visited in Yakutpura had been closed on Wednesday night itself. AIB functionary Zubair Goplani said that rehabilitation work in the villages of Maneja and Maretha was still not complete. ""People there have still not been allowed to go back to their homes by villagers despite several attempts by the administration,"" Goplani said.

The claims of the organisation were found true when the members visited the Maretha village in the afternoon. The members were surprised when the sarpanch of the village Kantaben Somabhai herself informed them that villagers were against the entry of persons who did not own land in the village.

""The villagers have said that initially they would allow only those persons who had land to settle here. I do not know the reason for such a stance, but this is what they are saying,"" Kantaben said. A visit to the minority dominated areas in the village by the representatives revealed that almost all the houses there were empty.

However, the willingness of some riot-affected persons to participate in the electoral process came as a surprise to many. ""I will definitely participate in the elections. It would be better to complete the process early,"" said Saiyed Hayatbibi of Fatehgunj.

Sarvarjahan Sheikh, a resident of Kishanwadi, said, ""There is still fear amongst the residents, but I will definitely go for voting. That way we can select better representatives."" Similar views were expressed by others who were not directly affected by the riots.

The representatives also met the representatives of political parties and non-government organisations during their visit. While the BJP and a section of advocates made representations for the polls, the Congress, AIB, Janta Dal (Secular) and People''s Union for Civil Liberties opposed the same at this stage.

The three officials which comprised the team were S K Mendiratta, legal advisor to the Election Commission, secretary to the commission, Ghanshyam Khohar and N N Butolia, under secretary.

18,We are well stocked with food: Delhi govt,"NEW DELHI: Even though Delhi has been declared drought-hit, the state government said there was adequate stock of all essential food items. â€˜â€˜We have an abundance of all essential items. Prices rise only when there is panic buying,â€™â€™ Delhi state food and supplies minister Haroon Yusuf said.

Food Corporation of Indiaâ€™s senior regional manager for Delhi, Neena Seth, said, â€˜â€˜We have nearly 300,000 tonnes of wheat and rice in our stocks for the city. The state government is collecting only 20,000 tonnes a month.â€™â€™ She said all states supplying food items to Delhi had plenty of stock to meet the cityâ€™s requirements for a long time. â€˜â€˜We have 64 million tonnes of wheat and rice as stock in the country,â€™â€™ she said.

An official of the state governmentâ€™s food and supplies department said, â€˜â€˜Both the Centre and the state are so well stocked that even in the most unlikely event of a drought lasting three-four years, we will have no shortage.â€™â€™

â€˜â€˜The Centreâ€™s monthly quota of kerosene for the Delhi government is 20,223 kilolitres. The entire amount is available and there is no report of any shortage from any oil depot or public distribution system shop,â€™â€™ he said.

He said even the poor wouldnâ€™t suffer. â€˜â€˜Under the Antodaya and Annapurna schemes, we have 320 tonnes of rice and 800 tonnes of wheat. For people below the poverty line, we have 3,770 tonnes of rice and 9,425 tonnes of wheat,â€™â€™ the official said.

He said there are about 1,500 licensees for selling pulses and each had a storage capacity of 2,000 quintals. Other retailers were likely to have similar stock, the official said.

Officials, however, fear some unscrupulous traders may start hoarding to make fast money. â€˜â€˜The government will take strict action against hoarders. The enforcement department has been asked to ensure that people below the poverty line get their ration,â€™â€™ Yusuf said.

He said in case supply to shops dwindle or prices rise, the government would impose the Essential Services Maintenance Act.

The minister said members of agricultural produce marketing committees had been directed to make rounds of retail vegetable markets and check for any overcharging. He said the prices of vegetables would continue to be published in newspapers.

After his return from South Africa, he criticised in Kolkata on Thursday the Trinamul Congressâ€™ bandh call on August 5, saying that the party had no â€œmoral rightâ€� to do so. â€œThe Trinamul Congress has no moral right to call a bandh as they are still with the NDA. Mamata Banerjee is herself partially responsible for the situation, as she did not do anything to revert the decision when she was the railway minister. What the Trinamul Congress wants to do is not clear to us,â€� the chief minister told newspersons at the state secretariat.

Bhattacharjee regretted the Centreâ€™s decision of going ahead with the bifurcation. â€œThis decision will go against the interests of West Bengal and the neighbouring states. The national perspective should have been kept in mind while taking the decision,â€� he said. The chief minister said he will speak to deputy prime minister L.K. Advani again over the issue.

â€œWhen I had talked with him earlier, we had hoped that something positive would emerge from the Cabinet meet. It is sad that it did not happen. I will speak to him again,â€� he said. Bhattacharjee attacked railway minister Nitish Kumar for pressing ahead with the bifurcation. â€œThe decision has been taken under political pressure. â€œNitish Kumar is fomenting regional parochialism through such decisions,â€� he added.
