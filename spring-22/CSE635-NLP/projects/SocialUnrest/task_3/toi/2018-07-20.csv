0,Elusive fire safety norms at govt buildings,"ahmedabad: as the ahmedabad municipal corporation eyes on 418 buildings having failed to abide by fire safety norms and functioning without building use permission, a paradox of sorts stares the civic body in the face. according to congress corporators of the amc, no less than 110 buildings housing government and semi-government institutions continue to flout the norms that till date has seen disconnection of gutter, water and power lines at 17 commercial high rises. while officials of the amc disclosed that stern notices have been issued to all the 418 residential and commercial high rise buildings for non-installation of fire-fighting equipment, sources in the public works department pointed out that numerous government and semi-government institutions continue to function without heeding to any norms. ""though notices have been issued by amc to these government-owned office-buildings, little has been done to follow up. while innocent occupants of commercial and residential high rises are being penalised for the builders' follies (it was primarily their job to ensure fire safety in buildings) the corporation, under pressure of the state government is content to turn a blind eye to this problem,"" said a resident of a high rise in shahibaug. recently, residents of one samvid apartment in shahibaug lodged a police complaint and filed a case with the high court against amc's ""threat-notice"" for disconnection of water, gutter lines if they did not install fire-fighting equipment in the building. ""the builder should be held responsible for the over 18 flats that he gave possession to private individuals (mostly of middle class) during the past seven years. why should the corporation hold us responsible ? we are not to blame,"" a resident of samvid said. sources in amc disclosed some of the semi-government and government institution-defaulters: ""banks, hospitals, post and telegraph, the list includes virtually every government-owned and recognised institution one can think of. yet, only residential and commercial buildings owned by private individuals are being targeted."" the list includes three blocks of civil hospital, central bank of india in raikhad, post and telegraph headquarters in khanpur and its branch office in shahpur, apna bazar building in bhadra, state bank of india and bank of india offices in raikhad, bombay mercantile bank in kalupur. a senior officer of amc disclosed, ""we have served notices to all government institutions directing that they adhere to fire safety norms. but, without gujarat government's nod we cannot proceed against its offices.""

4,"Mango season over, export policy announced","lucknow: while mango goes out of its season, the up government now announces its mango export policy. however, the belated announcement brings no cheers to the mango growers, whose total export has not been able to cross more than 40 per cent of their total production of nearly 42 lakh tones this year. the new export policy was approved by the state cabinet that met here on thursday under chief minister rajnath singh. the new policy stipulated for three years with immediate effect, envisages to give incentives to mango exporters. while raw material for packaging purposes will be exempted from trade tax, the government has decided to give a subsidy of 50 per cent or rs 40 per kg on air freight in the first year. this will reduced successively to 40 per cent or rs 32 per kg in 2002 and to 30 per cent or rs 24 per kg in 2003. besides this, the existing scheme of an incentive of rs 5 per kg for brand promotion will be intact for mainly three mango verities-- dusseheri, langra and chausa. as the mango is perishable commodity, insurance cover has been provided to mango exporters in adverse situation caused by insolvency and market slump. but such a benefit would be given only after the mango exporters are able to give proof of his sufferings and strictly when the trade tax liability has not been passed on to third party. while briefing about the policy, chief secretary bhola nath tiwari, however, fumbled when asked to comment about the delay in the announcement of the policy. although finding it difficult to defend the government, he said the policy had still scope, as chausa variety of mango grown in saharanpur has still time to ripe. but then the worst deprived of the benefit are the mango growers of famous malihabad and mall, known for its dusseheri variety world over. by another decision, the government has decided to give away its 50 acres of land for setting up of a regional sub-centre of the sports authority here on kanpur road. similarly, the speech aid called ""vani sri"", a device developed by iit, kanpur to help mentally retarded children has been exempted from trade tax.

6,Controversial Bengal minister to pen a book,"kolkata: writing a book is not something novel. but when controversial transport minister subhas chakraborty writes a book, it is bound to generate interest. chakraborty knows this well. so he is working overtime to complete it. though chakraborty claims humbly that it will be an ""ordinary book on social issues"" he does not deny that it will deal with ""controversial issues such as problems within his party as well as national political issues."" the salt lake scandal - the ongoing controversy over the recent police raid at yuva bharati stadium - and charges that he has links with the underworld will also feature in his book. chakraborty has no doubt that the raid was instructed by top bosses of the cpm to further marginalise him in the party. ""am i to believe that an ordinary dsp conducted the raid (at salt lake stadium) on his own? he would not dare to do so unless instructed by people at the top,"" chakraborty told this newspaper on thursday. yet he looked relaxed. sitting at his first floor room at the state assembly, chakraborty described the ""unending attempts"" by a section of the ""top cpm leadership"" to malign him and corner him in the party as ""natural"" and ""part of a dialectical process."" ""in the 21st century the entire marxist-leninist philosophy has to be critically examined. i can no longer blindly support lenin and stalin,"" chakraborty said. ""but most of the comrades in my party do not dare to question leaders like lenin, stalin and mao zedong. so they blindly follow the gospels and criticise me for talking aloud,"" the controversial leader said. chakraborty also laughed away the recent attempts by his party to gag his voice. the manner state cpm secretary anil biswas recently decreed that he would no longer be allowed to talk to the media only evokes a smile from him. ""how can you stop me from talking? true, i am revealing the problems that exist within my party to the people. but i do not consider the common man to be our enemies. those who are trying to suppress my voice should have had the confidence to reveal inner-party problems to the common man,"" he said. and it is his strong faith on the people, that inspired him to write the book, he says. the truth must be revealed to all. ""i don't know when i will be able to complete the book. but it will be published,"" chakraborty said. but what if the party takes disciplinary action against him for revealing party secrets? chakraborty laughs again. ""there will be more conflict. but conflict will help development. this is the dialectics through which our party will mature,"" he said with a smile. then he turns serious, even slightly agitated. ""before the elections i had told you that i would not quit the cpm unless i was expelled. now i say that i will not quit even if i am expelled. i will continue my fight within the party,"" he said with conviction.

7,CAG pulls up Bengal govt for poor performance,"kolkata: the left front government's repeated claims of big achievements in the field of rural develoment and job generations have drawn severe flak in the latest report of the comptroller and auditor general office in west bengal. on the other hand, cag report is stated to have indicated massive corruption by highlighting 'unauthorised expenditure, diversion of funds and creation of private assets with government money'. sources at writers' buildings admitted that the report has indicted the government for the poor performance in the field of poverty alleviation in rural bengal. thirty one per cent of the total budgetary expenditure earmarked in this purpose has been used to foot the bills for the 'top-heavy' 'babudom' of the panchayets and rural development. in contrast, as much as 82 per cent of the assisted families in the integrated rural development programme in between 1995 and 1999 remained mired below the poverty line. monitoring of the assisted families was grossly neglected as only 113,000 families were were monitored while actual numbers should have gone up to 757,000. out of 113,000, only 20,000 could cross the poverty line, the report recorded. nevertheless, state finance minister asim dasgupta assured to reduce the number of bpl people to 22 per cent in the current year. indicting the government of poor implementation and monitoring of the rural employment generation programmes, the report said it 'led to the failure to provide adequate employment opportunities' the report maintained that only four mandays on an average were provided to each rural youth as against 100 days of 'assured employment' under the employment assurance scheme in between 1995-2000. similarly there was a massive shortfall of 23.5 million mandays in jawahar rojgar yojana during the same period. the task of creating tangible rural assets remained largely unattended as 'only 1 to 2 per cent' of the irdp fund was spent on an average all over state as against the 20 per cent of the fund earmarked for that purpose. even though rs 7.24 crore was spent for that purpose during 1995-2000, rs 2.16 crore was found 'unfruitful'. meanwhile, the central grant to the tune of rs 222.57 crore for jawahar rojgar yojana and irdp could not be availed due to 'consistent non-utilisation of the funds by the department'. the cag team's test checks in four selected districts - burdwan, coochbehar, purulia and murshidabad highlighted the 'fund mismanagement and flagrant violation of norms'. the report noted that 27 panchayat samities of these districts did not prepare their annual budgets and accounts during last five years while 45 other panchayat samities did not maintain appropiation register of grants, register of works and assets,advance register etc. no internal audit was conducted in any of these samities. the state government failed to 'explain' the 'overstated expenditure' of rs 24 crore by the burdwan, purulia and coochbehar zilla parisads. while mursidabad zp made an advance of rs 1.39 crore to the staff of the samities was charged as the expenditures. muster rolls also did not indicate the address and and the quantum of works done by the labourers working under different job generation projects are done without dates. in the meantime, private assets were found created with the rs 6.57 crore of 'government money'. ""in the absence of the asset registers, no maintaince or identifications of assets are possible. consequently the creation of fictitious assets is highly probable,"" observed the report.

11,V P raps govt for not preparing for summit,"new delhi: former prime minister v p singh has deplored the lack of diplomatic groundwork before the summit, and said every initiative of the vajpayee government to improve ties with pakistan had ended in a disaster.singh told reporters here on thursday that though political parties had supported the government on the summit, the opportunity had been botched up by inadequate handling of the subtler aspects of diplomacy.""even when the ministers meet, they are sure that the officials have already covered much of the ground,"" he remarked. tracing the evolution of the normalisation efforts beginning with the lahore bus trip, the former pm said every such move had resulted in a fiasco.on the abrupt collapse of the agra talks, he remarked, ""they had promised new history; in the end, they could not issue even a joint statement."" he felt the government had rather a ""casual approach"" to such an issue of international importance. in the entire exercise, he said, musharraf had left vajpayee confounded by stealing a march over him in pushing across the pakistani viewpoint.commenting on the apparent ""pressure from the hardliners"" on the prime minister, singh said the top leadership should not come under any such pressure.

12,"Deal firmly with Pak, Jammu groups tell govt","jammu: pakistan president pervez musharraf's terming of masood azhar as a religious leader, his meeting with the hurriyat leaders, insistence on centrality of the kashmir issue and his refusal to link it with cross- border terrorism led to the collapse of the agra summit, according to jammu mukti morcha president virender gupta.addressing a joint press conference here on thursday called by the all parties jammu statehood movement, gupta said it was a fallacy to talk of the kashmir issue as the kashmir valley alone did not constitute the entire state of j&k. the two other regions of jammu and ladakh are much bigger and should be given equal weightage in any talks with pakistan. the indian government undermines its own case by talking only of kashmir and not j&k, he asserted.the hurriyat, he pointed out, represented but one miniscule section of kashmiris and that too secessionists. why should then government give these elements so much of importance? he asked.he asserted that the government should deal firmly with pakistan and discuss how to take back the areas of j&k which it has illegally occupied. if this was not possible, the government should snap the dialogue and start sponsoring anti-pak organisations.pakistan, he said, is dominated by the punjabi elite who have been prospering at the cost of mirpuris and other people whose culture had been destroyed due to the construction of the mangla dam.incidentally, the statehood movement is an umbrella organisation which was constituted recently to articulate the aspirations of the jammu people in various fora, jammu and kashmir nationalist front convener yash bhasin said. at least 16 organisations, including some political parties like the panthers party and the local units of the janata dal factions, were part of the movement, bhasin said adding intellectuals and several local politicians had also pledged their support to the movement.senior janata dal (s) leader dhan raj bargotra said it was important that jammu was conferred statehood at the earliest as it would help the centre in containing militancy in the state. bargotra declared that the first chief minister of the proposed state of jammu would be either from poonch, rajouri or doda. none of the jammu leaders would be a claimant for the post. these regions, which were less developed than jammu district and other nearby areas, would get top priority in developmental allocations, he added.the movement leaders declared that they would mobilise public opinion for the creation of jammu state and take a pledge to intensify their struggle for it on august 15. five days later (on august 20), those owing allegiance to the movement would take out a procession from satwari to raj bhavan.unlike the present state of j&k, in which a miniscule ruling junta from kashmir had been discriminating against jammu and ladakh, the sub- regions within the proposed jammu state would get equal treatment, various leaders asserted.jammu muslim united front leader n.d. qazi said it was wrong to term the demand for j&k's trifurcation as communal. people from all communities had been living in harmony through centuries in the jammu region, he said, adding they would continue to do so even after the creation of jammu state.

13,NGOs protest AIDS workers' arrests,"new delhi: can material prepared for spreading awareness on hiv/aids be construed as pornographic? the question has been raised by activists, angered at the denial of bail to members of a non-government organisation working with gay groups in lucknow. they have been charged with running a sex racket.signed statements by activists from across the country are questioning the arrests of the bharosa and naz foundation international members. these ngos have been charged with promoting ""unnatural sexual activities"" and distributing obscene books. the offices of the ngos have been sealed and material used for aids education and awareness seized for being obscene.according to the up police, the two organisation have been promoting homosexuality, which is inimical to the indian cultural values. ironically, in the wake of the deaths due to aids, the central government has recognised gay groups as being a vulnerable segment, requiring urgent intervention.the national aids control organisation supports ngos working with these groups. naz foundation international, in fact, provides support by way of awareness material to 13 ngos all over the country. ngos, which have signed protest letters, noted that like other individuals, gays have the basic right to life and health, to accurate information and services without discrimination and fear. ngos are demanding that those arrested should at least be granted bail.naco project director jvr prasada rao termed the incident ""most unfortunate"". aids activists have had a brush with the police in the past too. but it was limited to arrests of the peer educators, who need to go out in the field and talk about safe sex practices. to get over this problem, state aids societies have started giving identity cards to peer educators.lawyers' collective, one of the activist organisations working on aids, while asking for bail, has termed the activists' arrests and sealing of ngo offices, a gross violation of the activists' fundamental rights.

14,Bihar govt unconcerned about kala-azar menace: Thakur,"patna: the centre is alarmed over the rise in kala-azar cases in bihar and few districts of jharkhand and uttar pradesh and has prepared a rs 300 crore comprehensive plan to eliminate the disease in next ten years. 3955 cases of kala-azar were reported from 36 districts of bihar in june. addressing a press conference here on friday, union health and family welfare minister c p thakur voiced concern over the negligence shown by bihar government in tackling the situation and said that centre sanctioned rs 70 lakh for controlling the disease, but bihar government is yet to inform about the utilisation of funds. the centre, he said, would strictly monitor the eradication of kala-azar from bihar. he said that bihar government is not properly distributing medicines of central pool in primary health centres, referral hospitals and district hospitals. ""centre is ready to provide assistance to bihar government for improving health services in the state, but state health department even did not attend national-level meetings of state governments, including the recent one on family welfare measures,"" thakur said and added that bihar government spent only rs nine crore on family welfare measures against the sanctioned amount of rs 95 crore in 1997-98, rs 39 crore against rs 72 crore in 1998-99 and rs 72 crore against rs 117 crore in 1999-2000. thakur admitted that the central team also detected five kala-azar deaths in sitamarhi district and one in madhubani district caused by spurious sodium antimony gluconate (sag) medicines which was supplied by the union government store. ""the centre had purchased the medicines from toshika, a chandigarh-based medicine company,"" he said and added that all medicines of the company were withdrawn and seized for laboratory test in calcutta and delhi for its authenticity. ""test report is expected to be submitted in next few days and the centre is ready to hand over the supply of spurious kala-azar medicines case to the cbi, if the need arises,"" he added. thakur, who is himself a physician, said that first line of drug of kala-azar, sag, is not effective in the present circumstances. second line medicine, like pentamidine, also proved less effective and a new drug ampho tericin and lipid complex is effective. centre has decided to encourage treatment of the disease through ampho tericin, 20 doses of which cost rs 8000 -rs 10000 per patient, he said and added that treatment of kala-azar from lipid complex, which costs around rs 1.50 lakh, would prove costly. thakur said doctors should properly diagnose the patients before prescribing the medicines as they have side-effects. spraying of ddt, two times per year, is essential to control sand-fly, the carrier of the disease. bihar is a kala-azar prone area. in 1977 and 1991, over 700 and 10000 people had died respectively of the disease, he said. the minister said that centre has sanctioned rs 2.5 lakh for installing 10 condom vending machines at important public places in patna. he said that it is not possible to allot 50 per cent of the seats in the government medical colleges of bihar on donation basis. ""only 15 per cent seats for the nri could be made available on donation as per the guidelines of the union government. in private medical colleges, 50 per cent seats on merit, 35 per cent on donation and 15 per cent also on donation for nri had been provided under the central guidelines,"" he said and advised bihar government to develop proper infrastructure, including filling up of vacant posts in all medical colleges and increase the seats by 50 per cent so that students of the state do not migrate to other states for medical education.

16,New excise policy to facilitate sale of liquor,"new delhi: the city government would soon formulate a policy to facilitate sale of imported foreign liquor in delhi. the excise department would be determining the price structure for the ifl before putting it on shelves in the government-run liquor vends. at present, only five-star hotels are allowed to serve imported liquor once they pay excise duty to the state government. however, there is no uniform price structure for ifl and the hotels are free to serve it at any price. according to excise minister mahinder singh saathi, the excise department would soon start working on the new policy for the sale of ifl. he said the government had planned to sell ifl from the proposed private liquor vends, but the proposal was delayed when the privatisation scheme was deferred three-months back. however, the government is now planning to bring back the new excise policy which advocates semi-privatisation of liquor distribution in the city. besides the 240 government-owned liquor shops which are managed by the state-run corporations, the new excise policy proposes to have 45 private liquor vends. these vends will sell both foreign and indian-made liquor at prices determined by the government. when ready, the government will notify the new policy permitting five private liquor shops to operate in each of the nine city districts. saathi said changes have been made to the current excise policy to make the liquor business more competitive. recently, the government slashed the prices of popular brands of medium range liquor. prices of all brands sold in the government outlets which ranged from rs 91 to rs 200 were lowered by 10 per cent. however, prices of upper range and lower range remained the same. saathi said the idea behind this decision is to check smuggling of liquor from the neighbouring states. ""now our prices are same as in the neighbouring haryana and uttar pradesh. medium range liquor is consumed widely. our uniform pricing would deter bootleggers from smuggling liquor into delhi,"" he added. the government has done away with fixed ordering pattern with effect from july this year. the 10 per cent reduction in the maximum retail prices of medium range liquor also means 10 per cent reduction in the excise duty paid by these brand manufacturers to the government. excise minister said the government has already bridged the gap in revenue by pushing up the brand fee for upper range liquor brands. early this year, the government had raised the brand fee for high priced liquor from rs 50,000 per annum to rs 2 lakh per annum. saathi conceded there had been widespread resentment among the liquor manufacturers on reduction in liquor prices. ""some manufacturers have been unhappy about our decision. but the new prices are at par with other states. in fact, in the past, our government had been allowing these manufacturers to sell at a higher price which resulted in large scale smuggling. in turn, it meant huge revenue loss to us,"" he asserted. he said the government will ensure that all brands are put on the shelves and no particular brand is favoured above another.

17,Oppn stops minister from tabling varsity report,"bangalore: opposition members in the upper house on friday succeeded in preventing higher education minister g. parameshwar from presenting the joint select committee's report on universities on grounds that it had lost its character following the abrupt resignation of some opposition members. at the end of an hour's acrimonious debate, acting chairman david simeon announced that the issue would be resolved in his chambers on monday by consulting the treasury and opposition members. when parameshwar sought to present the committee's report, opposition leader k.h. srinivas objected on the ground that it had lost its character with some members resigning. ``you call it by any name but not report of the joint select committee.'' srinivas was supported by d.h. shankar murthy and b.s. yediyurappa (both bjp), b.s. horatti and m.p. nadagouda (jd-u) and m.c. nanaiah (jd) who were unanimous in their opinion that the report could not be called as that of the joint select committee. the members had resigned protesting against the ruling party members' `partisan' attitude. refuting the allegations, parameshwar asserted that the meeting's proceedings were made available to all members while several had even given a note of dissent to various clauses. ``the members have resigned for no valid reason,'' he maintained. according to parameshwar, the committee hadn't lost its character just because a few members resigned. ``there are members from other parties also and hence the committee continues to be called as the joint select committee. moreover, the note of dissent given by the members has been incorporated in the report.'' srinivas suggested that the issue be resolved in the chairman's chambers on monday. the house was adjourned for the day.
