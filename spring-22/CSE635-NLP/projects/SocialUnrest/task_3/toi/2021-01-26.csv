0,UP Congress to decide on support to Mulayam govt,"KANPUR: The Uttar Pradesh Congress President, Jagdambika Pal said here on Monday that a decision on whether or not to continue support to the Mulayam Singh Yadav government in the State would be taken on Tuesday at a meeting of party''s office-bearers to be held in Lucknow.

The State Congress President told reporters that party office-bearers had earlier decided to support the Mulayam government and added that they will now take a decision on whether or not this must continue.

Pal said that the decision that is arrived at tomorrow would be conveyed to the Party High Command.

1,Cricket may hit polls,"HYDERABAD: The India-Pakistan cricket series, tentatively scheduled for early March, has the potential to hamper voter-turnout, affect poll prospects of political parties and catch the pollster off guard, a fact that went unnoticed so far.

The state government realised the potential threat when a city caller, Ajender Reddy, during a phone-in programme with chief minister Chandrababu Naidu, on Monday said that there was a possibility of politicians getting bowled over if the poll dates clash with the Indo-Pak cricket series, a much-anticipated event in the sub-continent.

He said as the Indo-Pak series has special importance, the voters will get glued to the television sets and will not step out of houses to exercise their franchise.

The appeals by the President and the governor, exhorting people to cast their vote without fear or favour,may go unheeded.

Taken aback, Naidu said the government would draw the attention of the Election Commission to this issue. He said, ""Vote is our right and educated sections need to think more seriously and see that they exercise their franchise.""

Later talking to reporters, Naidu said the government would write to the EC and urge them to ensure that the cricket series does not clash with poll dates.

""Cricket can affect voting percentage across the country as simultaneous polls to the Lok Sabha and Assembly are likely,"" he said. During the elections to the Municipal Corporation of Hyderabad some time ago, the voter-turnout was poor in the posh localities of the city, due to an international match, which was live on satellite channels.

2,AP govt unguarded on potential flu outbreak,"HYDERABAD: The bird flu (avian flu) is sending alarm bells ringing across Southeast Asian countries even as Pakistan confirmed on Monday that the deadly virus has surfaced there also.

However, it appears that the state government is yet to take cognisance of the outbreak, which the World Health Organisation warned could mutate and become more dangerous.

Till late on Monday evening, the state government has not received any alert message from the Union health ministry on the problem, nor is it working out modalities to contain the potential virus spread.

When contacted, health minister Kodela Sivaprasada Rao said that the state government had not received any directive from the Centre, but promised to take up the issue with the officials on Tuesday.

According to the WHO, individuals who are exposed to chicken are most likely to be contracted with the avian flu. Though there has been no evidence that â€˜person to personâ€™ transmission is occurring, there are fears that the strain could mutate.

The bird flu was first noticed in 1997. Like any other flu, it has similar symptoms that include fever, sore throat, and cough. The types known to infect humans are influenza A subtypes H5N1 and H9N2.

Following the outbreak in Hong Kong, it was found that all living in close proximity with infected poultry was the main cause in all the 18 cases.

The conditions cited by the health organisations â€” including poor sanitation in the chicken markets and their close proximity to residential areas; no central slaughtering facility for chicken â€” for the spread of the avian flu exist aplenty in Hyderabad and elsewhere in AP.

Except for a couple of chainstores, the rest of the chicken outlets in the city slaughter the birds within their premises and hardly maintain hygienic conditions.

The WHO pointer that as of now, person-to-person transmission is not taking place for the outbreak has come as a saving grace for scores of passengers, who travel to the Southeast Asian countries.

3,"NGOs, govt give A'bad the go-by Money matters","AHMEDABAD: Its proximity to the seat of power has not helped the city. The quake-affected people in Ahmedabad feel that while an overwhelming number of NGOs and the state government were seen working in Kutch and other affected districts, they have got a cold-shoulder from all quarters.

""The thrust of reconstruction has been in rural areas alone. But villagers are not the only ones who need help. Some of us are under tremendous financial stress and are in no position to fund reconstruction of our houses. Just because we live in Ahmedabad does not mean that we have money,"" says Bharat Choksi, member of the committee to reconstruct Mansi.

Choksi conceded that when they started to rebuild Mansi they had great hopes, but that is not the case now as lack of funds had forced them to stop the work. ""We have approached many agencies but no one has the funds to help Crores of rupees came for reconstruction work but when we ask the NGOs they say they have been instructed to concentrate on Kutch alone,"" says Choksi.

Office-bearers at Home Losers'' Service Association of Ahmedabad (Holsaa) admit that such a sentiment is prevalent among residents. ""People feel the government has not done enough in terms of helping them rebuild their lives. Merely giving compensation money is not enough,"" says a Holsaa official.

The state government gave a compensation of Rs 1.75 lakh to those who lost their houses in the January 26 earthquake. According to sources, the victims were given 90 per cent of the amount with a rider that the remaining 10 per cent will be paid after the completion of work. However, the district collectorate started issuing recovery notices to residents of the buildings that collapsed in the quake and have not been reconstructed so far. According to Holsaa figures,work is yet to start at as many as 26 sites because of a number of reasons, ranging from paucity of funds to the differences among residents.

Rahul Purohit, who had a flat in the A-block of Shikhar Apartments, believes that the focus of all the agencies, including the state government, has been on Kutch from the beginning. ""The focus being on Kutch is justified.

But those who have suffered in other parts should not be completely forgotten either,"" says Purohit. According to him, forget nabbing the builders, the government has not even helped the residents of Shikhar get a plan of the building from AUDA.

MS Shanker, who had a flat in Padmashree Apartment in Navrangpura, believes that the discrimination between rural areas of Kutch and Ahmedabad was there from day one. ""Sometimes many of us feel that we should have died in the quake. At least, we would not have been forced through such hardships later.""

4,EC to take a call on simultaneous polls: Poojary,"MANGALORE: Congress leader and state party president Janardhan Poojary said it was the Election Commission''s discretion to hold simultaneous polls, as the gap between Lok Sabha and Assembly polls in eight states was less than six months.

Replying to a query on the difference of opinion between the Chief Minister S M Krishna and himself regarding the simultaneous polls, Poojary maintained that as the chief minister he has been given the mandate by the people to rule for five years. ""But, think of the cost of holding polls within a gap of six months to state assemblies. It would be enormous. Moreover, the people have given the mandate to the Election Commission to decide how to hold the polls, if the two polls fell within six months,"" he answered.

He pointed out that 99 per cent of the leaders and partyworkers had given their vote in favour of simultaneous polls and this issue would be decided at the party''s legislature party meet soon, he added.

On the chances of Congress in the ensuing polls in the light of Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh results, Poojary said it was not anti-incumbency, but ''Hindutva'' slogan which had given unfavourable result to his party. ""Here, we know how to counter the Hindutva brigade,"" he asserted. He also indicated that a survey had indicated that Congress would win two-thirds majority in the polls.

5,Congressmen asked to demand arrest of Ananth Kumar,"MANGALORE: KPCC president Janardhan Poojary on Tuesday has directed the Congress party workers to carry out widespread agitations all over the state, to pressurise the Centre to arrest state BJP president Ananth Kumar, against whom the Supreme Court has issued notices based on a petition alleging arbitrary sanction of loans to the tune of Rs 14,500 crore when he was the union minister of urban development.

Speaking to reporters here, Poojary said the issue will also be one of the main poll planks for the coming assembly elections, which would be held simultaneously along with Lok Sanha polls. He urged the Centre, which was maintaining a glorified silence over the issue, to attach the properties of Kumar immediately.

Alleging that Centre was biding its time to help Kumar ''destroy evidence'', he questioned why the BJP, which was baying for the blood of Roshna Baig in the Telgi case, was silent on this issue for so long.

Poojary said the probe into this incident should not be handed over to the CBI, as he had lost faith in the agency and should be handed over to an independent agency like Stampit, which is currently investigating multi-crore Stamp paper racket.

""If the CBI was honest, it could have suo moto registered a case against Kumar and other officials and investigated the matter. This has not happened so far,"" Poojary observed pointing out at Judeo case, where CBI stepped in late.

He also accused that Karim Lala, the prime accused in stamp paper racket, had purchased the Centre stating that otherwise why would an accused demand for CBI investigation?

7,SC to come out with law on right to shelter,"NEW DELHI: As cold wave has already taken a toll of 700 people without a roof to cover themselves, the Supreme Court on Tuesday admitted for hearing two significant public interest petitions raising the fundamental issue of right to shelter.

The petitions have sought a direction to the Centre and 13 states to take immediate steps to provide, shelter, food and warm clothes to lakhs of poor and homeless people across the country.

One E R Kumar along with Rohit Mammen Alex and one Deepan Bora and six others have said that the governments must draw up immediate and time-bound plans for construction of adequate shelter houses along with basic and essential amenities as well as their efficient management.

Maintaining that right to shelter was a part of right to life under Article 21 of the Constitution, the petitioners said that ""there is a clear mandate in our Constitution that the state must provide basic amenities to the citizens, which is required to lead a dignified life.

""This must include the most basic of these amenities, which is shelter"", petitioners'' counsel Prashant Bhushan said.

8,SC issues notice to UP Govt over anti-Sikh riots plea,"NEW DELHI: Moved by the plea of an anti-Sikh riots victim 20 years ago alleging denial of compensation due to him, the Supreme Court on Tuesday issued notice to Uttar Pradesh government.

Petitioner Gurbachan Singh Salooja''s counsel H S Phoolka said that pursuant to a Allahabad high court order in 1996, the district magistrate had quantified the compensation as Rs 95,000 and Rs 85,000 for arson and looting of victim''s residential premises and commercial establishment respectively.

The state government challenged that order but the apex court in 1999 dismissed its plea.

However, when Salooja appeared before the compensation officer and submitted the certificates issued to him by the district magistrate for grant of Rs 1,80,000 compensation, he was given only Rs 15,000 in January 203.

When he challenged the compensation officer''s action in the high court, he was asked to raise the issue before a civil court. The high court failed to appreciate that Salooja was not asking for enhancement of the compensation but only seeking enforcement of his fundamental rights.

A Bench of Justices N Santosh Hegde and B P Singh issued notices to the Mulayam Singh Yadav government, its special secretary (communal control cell), district magistrate of Lalitpur and member of the revenue board, who acts as the compensation officer.

9,Proposal to remove jute from Essential Commodities list,"KOLKATA: In a significant development the Union textile ministry has proposed to bring raw jute and jute textiles out of the purview of the Essential Commodities (EC) Act.

The joint secretary (textile), Atul Chaturvedi, has asked the Jute Commissioner (JC), S Majumdar, to send him a detailed report on the after ""examining the pros and cons of removing raw jute and jute textiles from the EC Act"".

Bringing raw jute and jute textiles out of purview of EC Act means the end of protectionism to the jute industry. The Union textile ministry feels that its proposal stems from the concept of ""repositioning the jute industry to become an internationally competitive industry in the country against the backdrop of liberalisation"".

According to the textile ministry, there was no need to control production of jute textiles since jute was already covered under the minimum support price (MSP) fixed by the government. Besides, the ministry was of the view that since the JC has powers to notify MSP for different varieties and grades of jute, the price of value added items could be left to the market forces.

This means that if raw jute is brought out from the purview of EC Act then it would mean the end of MSP for raw jute as well as fixing the price for value added products. It also indicates that the Mandatory Jute Packaging Act would become ""armless"".

The textile ministry is insistent on bringing raw jute and jute textiles out of purview of EC Act for it feels that the jute industry ""needs to be freed from the shackles of regulations"".

Meanwhile, the Indian Jute Mills'' Association (IJMA) had convened an emergency meeting last week to discuss the issue. The IJMA is expected to hold another round of meeting soon and submit its opinion on the textile ministry''s proposal.

13,"Monkey menace: Delhi govt blames MCD, NDMC","NEW DELHI: Monday''s incident, where a two-month old baby was mauled by a monkey in east Delhi, seems to have had little impact on officials responsible for keeping the menace in check. Even while Kajal''s parents grieve the death of their child, civic agencies and the Delhi government are too busy passing the buck.

Though the number of complaints regarding monkey attacks have nearly doubled, according to a wildlife expert, there has been little progress by concerned agencies in dealing with the issue.

The Delhi government''s environment ministry has blamed the civic agencies, the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) and the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) for not catching monkeys. ""The responsibility lies with the MCD,"" said environment minister Raj Kumar Chauhan.

Ministry officials say that growing urbanisation has domesticated the simians. ""People feed these animals and even take care of them. MCD cannot shirk responsibility. In most states the civic agency is responsible for capturing the animals. We have given the MCD powers to do the same in Delhi,"" the official said. He added that if the NDMC was fulfilling its responsibility, there was no reason why the MCD couldn''t. NDMC''s enforcement department hires langurs to catch monkeys.

According to a senior official, MCD has just one contractor to catch monkeys who is often beaten up by residents, when he goes about his job. ""Monkeys are wild animals. It is not part of our job to capture them. But we have still hired a contractor who takes over 20 calls a day,"" said director, veterinary department, MCD, Dr S Srivastava.

In October last year Delhi government had captured some monkeys with the assistance of the civic agencies and Mumbai-based Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS). The monkeys were dumped in Rajokri earning the ire of the Haryana government.
