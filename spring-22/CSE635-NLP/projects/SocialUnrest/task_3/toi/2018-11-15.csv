0,Bihar feels the pinch of bifurcation,"patna: the posh guest house of steel giant tisco here recently went up for sale. the sale signifies the vanishing of the zamindari in which one was south bihar, remarked noted economist saibal gupta. jharkhand, he stressed, to residual bihar is like a rich brother living in america whose existence never affects the lifestyle of his brother living in india. there was never an economic integration between the plateau and the plains. thus when the state was bifurcated, it appeared that there was never any relationship between the two parts, he observed. however, one year after the bifurcation, its economic impact is being felt in patna, the capital of undivided as well as residual bihar. it's only the big hotels like maurya and chanakya which have not been much affected. smaller ones have seen their customers decreasing by 30 to 50 per cent. estate prices have crashed as builders of high-rise flats complain that finding buyers has become much more difficult. house owners are finding it hard to get tenants with roughly one-third of the officials shifting and offices of various union government undertakings and private companies moving lock, stock and barrel to the new promised land of jharkhand. after the bifurcation, the number of upper class people has drastically decreased, conceded sushil kumar modi. the economic statistics of bihar after bifurcation have gone from bad to worse. the credit-deposit ratio has dropped to around 20 per cent. about 93 per cent of the government revenue is spent on its establishment, said s c jha, chairman of the bihar finance commission, who pleaded for the downsizing of the government. bihar, economists point out, gives away rs 3,000 crore in debt service. a major portion of the rs 30,000-crore liability of undivided bihar is expected to fall on residual bihar. the only reason the state has managed to keep its deficit down is that it has refused to spend. all the government departments are flush with funds being surrendered year after year, observed gupta while expressing the hope that spending would increase under a decentralised panchayati raj system. the full impact of depleted internal revenue in terms of coal royalty and other sources due to the loss of jharkhand is yet to be felt. the coming years will see the government struggling more and more to pay even the salary to its employees. yet the government has shown little inclination for revitalising the slowing economy. jha was made to wait for three days before he was able to present his interim report to the chief minister. it has been more than two months since j j irani presented his report on ways and means for setting up industries in bifurcated bihar. among other things, irani strongly pleaded for a change of image. it may be difficult to say which state — bihar or jharkhand — is governed more badly. but in sharp contrast to bihar, jharkhand has already announced its industrial and sales tax policy to lure investments. residual bihar has shown no such urgency, remarked an official. at the time the state was bifurcated, there was a lot of talk about making residual bihar another punjab or haryana with emphasis on agriculture. farmers of bihar have been able to do wonders in growing paddy, tea, litchis etc despite an indifferent government. but the state saw paddy prices collapsing last year without a procurement price even as paddy from outside was dumped in the store houses of bihar. undivided bihar lost financially due to the freight equalisation policy of the centre. residual bihar may lose due to the lack of ability to procure and market its agricultural products.

4,Change in eye donation rules planned,"new delhi: plagued by the problem of over 10 lakh blinds and at least half a lakh more every year, the union health ministry desires to amend the total human organs act with a novel intent. it wants to make it binding on doctors, attending on a dying patient, seek the concerned relatives' consent for donating the dead's eyes. the proposed amendment would permit to incorporate the request for organ removal in the death certificate itself. it will also remind the doctors that they should seek the dead person's relatives' consent for the removal of the eyes, as a necessary formality, says dr r jose, a deputy director in the ministry of health and family welfare. ''since the original law does not mention eye banks, eye donations and other infrastructure related with corneal transplant, we want to amend the act,'' he said adding, ''we have framed the draft and are awaiting it's approval from the law ministry.'' dr jose elaborated that the proposed law is an amendment to the draft rules of the indian organ transplant act, 1994. the rules include storage of a dead's body organs to avoid their sale or misuse. enacted, the new act will also create demand for more corneal surgeons, better equipment, quality eye preservation media and quick services for collection of eye. as of today, the capital has the best of facilities, and about 900 eyes are being collected from about 450 donors every year. though the number of pledges is in lakhs, the execution of the will is not even one per cent. ''because of emotional barriers, wish of only 0.1 per cent of the 'pledged' donors is fulfilled by their relatives, highlighting the need for creating awareness about the critical need for eye donations,'' dr jose says. earlier, about 80 per cent cases of eye ailments comprised cataract-related blindness, which could be cured by surgery. but at present the hospitals are getting more cases needing corneal transplant for which the donors' eyes are required. ''to counsel the relatives, many hospitals have introduced trained grief counsellors who approach the aggrieved family and espouse the cause of eye donation,'' said dr ritu arora of guru nanak eye centre.

6,CMs to discuss stand on terror law with Sonia,"new delhi: congress chief ministers, who will be in delhi over the next two days for the meetings called by the prime minister and the home minister, will have special discussions with party president sonia gandhi on friday evening to formulate their line on the prevention of terrorism ordinance (poto). the main opposition party's stand is critical since the congress-led opposition has a majority in the rajya sabha and is, therefore, in a position to ensure that poto does not get parliamentary approval. as of now, all opposition parties have taken a united decision to oppose poto and reject it in parliament in view of its harsh provisions and the vast possibilities of misuse by the police, especially against the minorities. the congress, however, is in a dilemma. it has already drawn flak from the bjp on the ground that some congress-ruled states have poto-type laws. with the bjp deciding to launch a massive campaign on poto, particularly in the up elections, the congress also fears being branded ''anti-national and pro-terrorists''. since the meeting called by home minister advani on saturday is expected to focus on poto, it is imperative that the congress finalises its strategy and speaks in one voice. although it has taken a categorical position, seeking to justify it the party has asked its legal experts kapil sibal, salman khurshid, ashwani kumar, abhishekh singhvi and h r bhardwaj to do an indepth scrutiny of the bjp proposed law and the legislations in the congress-ruled states. they are to compare various clauses to see if they are any different and whether their provisions are as draconian as those contained in poto. the party is divided on the issue with one group agreeing that poto be opposed unequivocally and others arguing that the party cannot afford to oppose an anti-terrorism law. ''the situation has changed after september 11 and the country does need a special law. what we can do is seek dilution of the more draconian clauses so as to minimise its misuse,'' said one senior leader.
