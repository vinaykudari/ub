0,President clears new law for pvt hospitals,"NEW DELHI: Owners of nursing homes operating without registration can now be fined up to a maximum of Rs 5,000 and be sentenced to imprisonment of up to six months.

An estimated 1,500 illegal nursing homes operate in the city.

The proposed legislation, brought by the Delhi government, making laws governing nursing homes more stringent, received the presidential assent two weeks back.

The state government amended the Delhi Nursing Home Act (1953) and increased the fine on unregistered nursing homes from Rs 500 to Rs 5,000. The imprisonment term has been extended from three months to six months.

Delhi state health minister A K Walia said stricter set of laws were needed to book unregistered nursing homes. â€˜â€˜They donâ€™t meet basic medical requirements. We are not even sure whether they have qualified doctors and nurses, or even proper operation theatres and labour rooms,â€™â€™ he said.

By the new law, the registration period of the nursing homes has been increased from one year to three years.

About 550 nursing homes in Delhi are registered under the state health department. â€˜â€˜As we have a rough estimate of unregistered nursing homes, the health department is conducting a survey to determine the exact number of such illegal set-ups,â€™â€™ an official said. This, he added would ease a crackdown on them.

1,Nurse arrested for negligence,"AHMEDABAD: The police on Wednesday arrested a nurse of Shardaben Hospital, Jayashree Shah (42), on charges of negligence on duty causing harm to a 15-year-old boy, Kamlesh Gharade.

Kamlesh''s right arm had to be amputated allegedly because Shah had been negligent.

A case had been filed by the victim''s father, Charan Gharade against the Shardaben Hospital doctor and nurse attending to his son on April 30.

In his complaint, Gharade said Kamlesh''s right hand turned blue after he was administered an injection. On being shifted to V S Hospital, medicos there allegedly diagnosed that gangarine had set in the right arm of Kamlesh.

This could have been caused due to use of an injection after its expiry date. PI of Sherkotda AM Jadeja said: ""Shah has been booked under sections 337, 338, 114 of IPC (for negligence on duty causing harm to somebody).""

2,Delhi govt gets tough on gas pumps,"NEW DELHI: The recent case in which two petrol pumps were caught selling adulterated fuel by the Delhi Food and Civil Supplies (FCS) department has exposed the ease with which fake products can be passed off to the unsuspecting public.

In a series of raids, the department has lodged cases against two petrol pumps, Paras Auto Service Station at Asaf Ali Road and Sher Service Station at Pankha Road for selling adulterated petrol. Raids were also conducted and cases registered against two LPG agencies located in Gole Market and Trans-Yamuna areas. Six fair price shops were raided and their licenses have been suspended.

The raids were conducted with the assistance of the crime branch. And 22 fair price shops and four LPG agencies have been raided since Friday. ""We wanted to send a clear message that corruption will not be tolerated,"" food and civil supplies minister Haroon Yusuf said.

But despite all, adulteration especially in petrol pumps, is rampant.

""We all know that petrol is adulterated but it is very tough to bring the culprits to book,"" a government official said.

Easily accessible adulterants like naphtha and kerosene, also called solvents, are commonly used. They not only make the quality of petrol and diesel inferior but also cause pollution.

This is a major health hazard. Adulteration lead to an increase in particulate matter in the air that in turn causes respiratory ailments. The high benzene levels can be carcinogenic.

The Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) had done an independent study on fuel testing last year only to discover various loopholes even in the laboratory testing methods used for inspecting the samples.

""Mixing kerosene to petrol and diesel can increase the amount of sulphur which causes more pollution. This is very common in autos and taxis,"" Sunita Narain from CSE said. Such steps also nullify any positive effects of green fuels like CNG.

Meanwhile, an inquiry has been ordered against the officers in fair price shops. The raids are likely to continue for some time.

3,Spate of suicides in Dharwad,"DHARWAD: A spate of suicides in a span of 48 hours has shocked Dharwad. In separate instances, six persons took the extreme step. Shivanagouda Babugouda Biradar, a B.Sc second year student committed suicide by consuming poison at the U.G. Hostel in the University of Agricultural Sciences, Dharwad.

Hailing from Ingaleshwar in Bijapur district, Shivanagouda was reportedly disappointed in a love affair.

Autorickshaw driver Panchaksharaiah Veerayya Salimath of Mrutyunjaya Nagar, ended his life unable to wriggle out of a debt trap. He also consumed poison, the police said.

Twenty-four-year-old Hemalata Sangamesh Sajjanar, a resident of Jayanagar in Dharwad hanged herself in her house when family members were away, the police reported. The reason for the suicide is not known yet.

In yet another case, Vasudev Narayanrao Nadager (70), who was said to be suffering from mental illness jumped into an open well in Burli compound of Malamaddi and 40-year-old Durgappa Manappa Shivalli also ended his life the same way at Lakshmisinganakere, the police said.

Police said, Hanumant Reddy, a watchman in Mission compund died after he consumed poison reportedly in an inebriated condition. All the six bodies were sent to the district civil hospital for post mortem before being handed over to relatives.

4,'Vote bank politics ends in neglect',"DHARWAD: Disorder is the order of the day in Ward No. 20 in Dharwad. Represented by Congress member Mimija Begum Guttal, the ward has seen little improvement in the last two years.

Ward 20 covers slums like Jannat Nagar, Ambedkar Nagar, posh localities like Hukkerikar Nagar, Shivanand Nagar, part of Hosayallapur and Hirekeri. While citizens continue to suffer lack of civic amenities, little have they done to pressure the authorities. The corporator has blissfully ignored them.

The problem common to all these areas is lack of drinking water, bad roads, pig menace, filthy gutters and heaps of garbage strewn all over. I.M. Javali, who was mayor of Hubli-Dharwad Municipal Corporation twice earlier, had represented this ward. During his tenure, Javali did try to provide certain facilities. However, he concentrated on areas where his vote bank resided. Guttal has followed suit, allege residents of Hukkerikar Nagar. Their grouse is that the corporator never bothers to visit all the localities in the ward.

The water supply was erratic in the ward till the KUWSSB took over the responsibility of supplying water to the twin-cities. Residents complain that even now, the quantity of water they get is inadequate. The ward has a well-equipped crematorium which has been renovated recently, thanks to the efforts of some well-meaning citizens who got together to do it.

Even last journeys are memorable here â€” though it is said the dead go to hell or heaven, in Dharwad, it is difficult to reach even the crematorium. It means wading through slush and tripping into potholes â€” that is the road linking Hosayallapur to the crematorium. Those accompanying the dead curse the civic administration every step of the way to the funeral.

The water in Hirekeri, also known as ''Kolikere'', which lies adjacent to the crematorium, is highly polluted. The much-hyped scheme of desilting the tank was a flop. The atmosphere in and around the crematorium is also polluted due to the limestone kilns in the vicinity emanating foul smell and smoke.

Jannat Nagar and the adjoining Irani colony has been a hub of criminal activity.

Several illegal structures have come up near the Hubli toll naka and the authorities have failed the check their growth.

Citizens lament that those with muscle power have been encroaching on prime land with support from local politicians.

Mimija Begum Guttal claimed she has got five borewells drilled during her tenure and also got roads metalled in Ambedkar Nagar.

Construction of five tanks and electrification of 200 unauthorised houses are her other achievements.

Guttal has the habit of taking credit for works done by her predecessor I.M. Javali, said a resident of Jannat Nagar. Refuting this, Guttal said she had taken up several works ignored for the last 10 years.

5,Power tariff hike: Ministers asked to counsel farmers,"GANDHINAGAR: Chief Minister Narendra Modi instructed his ministers at the Cabinet meeting on Wednesday to ensure that the farmers'' unrest, as a result of the sharp rise in un-metered electricity rates, did not go out of control.

Ministerial sources said the CM told the ministers to fan out in different districts, and with the help of state officials, explain to the farmers and their leaders why the hike was necessary.

One minister later told TNN, ""There is indeed a need to tell the farmers that the per unit power cost has gone up drastically, while the electricity rate charged from the farmers has remained stagnant since 1990. Roughly, the cost of power incurred by the Gujarat Electricity Board in 1990 was 70 paise per unit, while the farmers were charged only 20 paise per unit.""

""Today, even after the price hike, the government would pay a subsidy of Rs 1.50 for every unit of power sold by the GEB to the farmers â€” much more than what was in 1990,"" the minister informed.

The CM wanted ministers to explain to farmers that the price of farm produce had gone up in the decade, but the energy bill to the farmers had remained the same. This justifies the hike.

On instructions from the CM, several ministers on Wednesday asked the state energy department to give them details on the cost at which electricity was produced by the GEB, the price at which it is made available to the farmers, subsidy being given by the state government per year, and a comparison with other states. Rajasthan, Maharashtra and MP pay considerably less subsidy than Gujarat.

Interestingly, the ministers with farming background are learnt to have still remained unsure on how they should convince farmers about the need for the price hike. They are learnt to be pinning hope instead on a good monsoon, which they believe would automatically cool the farmers'' tempers.

6,"Metro station on 'disputed' site, residents protest","NEW DELHI: Pusa Road residents on Wednesday blocked traffic to protest against the acquirement of their property by Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC).

The Karol Bagh metro station, on the third line between Barakhamba Road and Dwaraka, is due to come up in the disputed area.

Residents allege DMRC has not yet made it clear what kind of compensation will be provided to those occupying the premises. The property in question is 27, Pusa Road. The residents say the DMRC had served them the notice to vacate the premises latest by July 21.

â€˜â€˜We are all for the Metro, but we have been living here for 50 years, some alternative arrangement has to be made for us,â€™â€™ said Madhu Chaddha, a resident. As many as 15 families and 22 shops are located in the property.

DMRC officials, however, say legally they are in the right. â€˜â€˜Although we tried to serve the vacation notices on Tuesday, the residents refused to accept the same,â€™â€™ said chief project manager (third line) Vijay Anand.

Anand said the development was not sudden and the residents had even approached the court. â€˜â€˜Even the court conceded that technically and from the point of view of ridership this was the best location for the station,â€™â€™ he explained.

The residents contend that they have not been offered any compensation by DMRC so far. DMRC officials, however, say this was the Delhi governmentâ€™s territory. But the solution is not acceptable to both the Panchkuian Road and Pusa Road traders.

7,Modi govt shrugs off criticism in Best Bakery case,"GANDHINAGAR: The Gujarat government appeared unconcerned over the increasing pressure from a large number of international and national human rights organisations on reopening the Best Bakery case.

""As social organisations, they are within their rights to say what they like,"" commented state home minister Amit Shah, reacting to fresh criticism from Amnesty International.

He added, ""We cannot take a hasty decision in the matter as it is a very sensitive issue.""

Shah told TNN here on Wednesday, ""It will take between 60 and 70 days to study all the legal issues involved, including the statements of the witnesses and their legality.""

State legal secretary Bela Trivedi said she had received instructions from the home department to study the Best Bakery case and suggest what should be done next. ""I cannot say whether we may go in for appeal or not. We are studying. It will take time.""

8,Amarinder not bothered about law and order: Badal,"MUKTSAR: Former Punjab chief minister Parkash Singh Badal said that there was no possibility of SAD(B) snapping ties with the BJP led NDA government.

Though the NDA team could not reach Punjab to assess the political situation, Badal said Deputy Prime Minister LK Advani had already made the stand of the NDA government on the issue very clear, so there is no need to withdraw support, he said.

Badal was talking to media persons at his village on Wednesday where he had come to attend the ""bhog"" of the mother of Parmjeet Singh Lali, a SAD leader and member Punjab Public Service Commission.

He said at the time when caste violence had surfaced in Punjab, the economic condition was at a low and the law and order situation was deteriorating every passing day with a spurt in incidents of robberies and murders, the state police machinery was being tasked to harass Akalis by the chief minister.

Seeking action against Congress ministers indicted for indulging in corruption by Lok Pal, Badal said that before raising an accusing finger at Akalis without even a shred of evidence, the CM Punjab should set his own house right.

Being corrupt and anti-Sikh is an old tradition of Congress, he alleged, referring to PV Narsimha Rao and Rajiv Gandhi for their alleged involvement in JMM bribery case and Bofors scandal.

9,PU relaxes hostel rules for research scholars,"CHANDIGARH: The research scholars of Punjab University heaved a sigh of relief as the university authorities conceded to their demands and relaxed the rules of availing the hostel accommodation for this academic session, on Wednesday.

The scholars were agitated over the universityâ€™s new rules for giving hostel accommodation only to those scholars who have either cleared UGC NET or are funded by any other agency.

This left a large number of research scholars, who were not getting any assistance with no other option but to agitate against the new rules. The university since then had been thinking about relaxing the rules.

The university also agreed to provide the hostel accommodation to the research scholars for a period of three years during which they would be encouraged to qualify their UGC NET examination.

10,'Vote bank politics heart of the slum problem',"CHANDIGARH: The UT administration considers slums and politics to be deeply interlinked. In an official synopsis of encroachments and slums, the administration has said nurturing of vote banks by elected representatives and corporators has aggravated the problem of illegal occupation of public land.

Vested interests of politicians, emergence of new pressure groups and tactics employed by them have contributed in worsening the slum problem. The report deals with the critical issue of politicisation of rehabilitation.

It states the 1997 amendment to the Licensing of Tenements and Sites and Services in Chandigarh Scheme 1979, to extend the cut-off date for slum dwellers eligible for rehabilitation from January 1991 to December 1996 was done with an eye on the first municipal corporation elections.

The rationale behind the move was to include more slum dwellers in the list of registered voters. Rehabilitation policy measures of the UT administration date back to 1975 when the Licensing of Tenements and Transit Sites scheme was formulated. The scheme was area specific, with the cut-off date of January 1974.

However, the 1979 scheme took into its fold all squatters, irrespective of the place of residence. The cut-off date for the scheme was January 1978. Several amendments were made to the scheme thereafter.

In 1983, an amendment was made so that shops could be allotted to slum dwellers. The closing date for eligibility was extended to January 1991 in the year 1992.

The UT administration has also pinpointed reasons because of which the rehabilitation policy proved to be counterproductive.

The chief among these was allotment of plots and independent dwelling units to slum dwellers who were reselling them to earn profits.

Absence of rehabilitation policies in Panchkula and Mohali has also had a deteriorating effect on resettlement of slum dwellers in the city.

Citing the case of Dhanas milk colony, the report blames lax regulation on part of the official machinery to ensure that the land allotted to displaced persons was not misused.

Since the period of stay was not relevant while considering slum dwellers for rehabilitation, large-scale in-migration took place in the last decade.

The report says the intervention by courts and maintenance of status quo have also held up encroachment removal initiatives at different stages.

Referring to the devastating impact of slums, the report adds slums have crumbled civic infrastructure in the city, deteriorated law and order, increased traffic problems, added to in-sanitary conditions, reduced open spaces and caused theft of electricity and water.

11,Private colleges to contest govt fee,"HYDERABAD: Counselling for admission into private medical and dental colleges in the state is likely to be delayed as the Andhra Pradesh Private Medical and Dental College Managements Association is set to challenge the management quota and fee structure stipulated by the government on Tuesday.

This year 1,500 medical and 920 dental seats are available in the 14 medical and 10 dental private colleges in the state.

The government has fixed Rs 55,000 for medical and Rs 40,000 for dental seats for the Eamcet convenerâ€™s quota. A fee of Rs 2 lakh has been fixed for medical and Rs 1.1 lakh for dental seats to be filled by the management on the basis of the Eamcet rank. This leaves 25 per cent of the seats for the private colleges to sell as they like.

The association says the fee structure set by the government is not enough for private colleges which need a revenue of Rs 16 crore per annum to keep the classes going.

Association president P Ajay Kumar told The Times of India that as per a study conducted by A F Ferguson & Co in 1994, the private colleges incurred an expenditure of Rs 3.18 lakh per student per annum. The study was conducted at the behest of the Medical Council of India and the Union government in accordance with a Supreme Court judgment.

Even a study conducted by the state government in 2001 found that the cost of imparting medical education was Rs 3.51 lakh per student per annum, he said.

Against this backdrop, it was only fit that the government should implement the Supreme Court verdict to ease the burden on private managements, he said.

The association feels that the government should leave 50 per cent the total seats to the managements allowing them to charge a fee of Rs lakh per annum for each seat. If these contentions of the private colleges are not met, they would consider the option of conducting their own admission process, as per the apex court judgment, he warned.

Meanwhile, AP State Junior Doctorsâ€™ Association president B Prabhakar blamed private college managements for not following the MCI guidelines and making do with â€˜substandardâ€™ infrastructure and faculty. The entry of private colleges into the field has only increased the cost of education, he said.

12,"Online lotteries are illegal, says minister","KOLKATA: Bad news for online gamblers. State finance Asim Dasgupta said in the Assembly on Wednesday that the flourishing online lotteries such as Super Lotto and Fortune were illegal in West Bengal.

""These lotteries are being illegally run in the state. We have already filed cases against them, which are pending both at the High Court and the Supreme Court. That is why we cannot take any steps against them at present,"" Dasgupta told the House.

Dasgupta was answering a question by Sibdas Mukherjee of the Trinamul Congress on how various forms of gambling and betting were flourishing here if the state government was actually strongly opposed to these.

The Left Front government does not seem to mind though in netting Rs 7 crore annually from the races held at the Royal Calcutta Turf Club.

Dasgupta stated that the government had earned over Rs 38.5 crore from taxes on horse racing in RCTC over five years.

""The money comes from three different taxes â€” the TOT tax, betting tax and entertainment tax,"" he said, adding that the money usually came to the state governmentâ€™s coffers every week.

However, he explained that the state only allowed racing in Kolkata because it brought good money to its state exchequer.

""Otherwise, we are firmly against encouraging any form of betting in West Bengal,"" the minister told the House.

Dasgupta doled out detailed statistics to show that only 51 races were held in Kolkata ever year, against 267 in Chennai and 469 in Bangalore. ""While last year we earned Rs 7.66 crore from the races, Chennai earned around Rs 7 crore and Bangalore Rs 11 crore,"" he informed.

Replying to another question, Dasgupta said the state had no plans of starting another race course in Siliguri despite a high demand for such a facility.

""There is no such plan. What we are rather considering is a proposal to allow other states to bet on the Kolkata races from their own cities. However, we need to conduct some investigation and RCTC needs to clear its dues first before we can proceed further,"" he said.

13,Autos hold city traffic to ransom after clash,"KOLKATA: Major intersections across the city witnessed traffic snarls on Wednesday as auto-rickshaw drivers staged road blockades pre-empting a crackdown on their ''unauthorised'' counterparts.

The crossing near the Tollygunge Metro station saw vicious clashes between the police and auto drivers. Tempers ran high when a traffic sergeant slapped an auto-rickshaw driver. Police had to resort to a lathi-charge after hundreds of auto-rickshaws blocked the road in protest.

The drivers then started hurling stones at the police. To bring the situation under control, RAF personnel were pressed into action.

In solidarity, auto-rickshaw drivers staged blockades at Taratala, Hazra and Rash Behari Avenue crossings, throwing traffic completely out of gear. The blockades were withdrawn after police intervention.

The Ulto Rath Yatra also proved to be a great hurdle for commuters in the southern part of the city. Traffic was disrupted on Syed Amir Ali Avenue, Gariahat Road, Rash Behari Avenue, Ashutosh Mukherjee Road and Hazra Road.

In north Kolkata, dislocation of trams led to traffic chaos, DC (traffic) M K Singh said. â€œAt the Shyam bazar seven-point crossing, several trams derailed during the day. Tram services were also affected at Park Circus, Moulali, Lenin Sarani and Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road.â€�

Calcutta Tramways Company sources said deteriorating condition of the road surface and consequent pressure on the tracks led to the derailment of the tram cars.

The city police, meanwhile, planned a crackdown on the unauthorised autorickshaws soon after the distribution of holograms was over. A large number of autos have been denied holograms because of forged engine and chassis numbers, though they have valid papers.

14,Agitation over Shiv-Kali temple turns violent,"SAMASTIPUR: The ongoing agitation of people for the protection of a Shiv-Kali Mandir at Mathurapur Ghat near here turned violent on Wednesday when a Mandir supporter, identified as Rakesh Kumar Singh who had declared to immolate himself, was arrested and people lathicharged.

Samastipur SP Meghnath Ram denied that the police resorted to lathicharge but many eyewitnesses said that the police caned even women and children who got their limbs fractured.

According to sources, people, including Shiv Sena activists, had been agitating for a fortnight, demanding that a Shiv-Kali Mandir at the Mathurapur Ghat which has been threatened due to the ongoing construction of an approach road to the newly-built road bridge across the Burhi Gandak river be saved.

15,Ayodhya panel flays UP govt for seeking more time,"NEW DELHI: The Liberhan Commission on Thursday came down heavily on the Uttar Pradesh government for seeking more time to submit its arguments.

The state government counsel had requested three more weeks when the Commission met in the morning. He also asked for a video tape of the events of December 6, 1992.

Taking exception to the state government''s request, the Commission in its order said that a decade had passed and when the time had come for the Uttar Pradesh government to put forward its views, it was seeking more time, which was not acceptable.

Finally, the Commission gave the state government two days - July 24 and 25 - to submit its arguments.

On July 21, the Commission will meet to decide on a number of applications, which have been filed recently by the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) and Mohd Aslam Bhure.

While the AIMPLB has demanded that former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Kalyan Singh be summoned for cross-examination, Bhure has sought examination of Prime Minister Vajpayee, Kalyan Singh and re-examination of Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani.

A bizarre incident took place during the hearing when one Ayodhya Prasad Tripathi began distributing a pamphlet criticising the Commission for rejecting his application. He was asked to leave.
