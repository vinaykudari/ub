0,Human foetus display: nobody knows the law,"KOLKATA: Ray Chand Khatua or his brother Panchu does not know that exhibiting human foetus was illegal. No one has ever told them so â€” neither the police nor people at the nursing home from where they buy these regularly to display at fairs all over the state.

The duo has two offices by the name of R.S. Enterprises in the city, one in Bhowanipore and another at Beadon Street. From the Kasba Maidan, their next destination is Haridebpur Rathtala where they are currently exhibiting human foetus in a fair. No one has stopped them. â€œWe have taken permission from the police and the fair organisers,â€� they claimed.

â€œEverything is peaceful here. There is no complaint from the fair organisers or locals about the display. Anyway, you will have to go to the SP for any further details,â€� said Kasba police station additional IC G.M. Jamadar. Health officials admit they can do little.

â€œEven if there is a law, it will be up to the police to enforce it,â€� claimed director of health services Prabhakar Chatterjee. There is already growing concern over the illegal embryo trade. The National Guidelines for Accreditation, Supervision and Regulation of ART Clinics in India, 2003, prepared by a 20-member committee chaired by Dr Baidyanath Chakravarty has observed, â€œThere can be no further insult to human dignity than human embryos being exported.â€�

A Bill drafted on the basis of the guidelines is soon going to be introduced in Parliament. It says, â€œWith no ban on the use of 14-day-old em-bryos as well as a large number of unregulated clinics offering in-vitro fertilisation, India possesses the right ingredients to become an embryo surplus nation.â€�

1,State council of ministers accepts power reforms,"CHANDIGARH: The Punjab council of ministers has accepted in principle the recommendations of the expert group on power sector reforms.

In its meeting held here on Tuesday, the council of ministers after going over the report of the expert group said that the transitional costs of power sector reforms, and the funding by World Bank and multilateral agencies, must be worked out separately and placed before the cabinet for approval. The power sector reforms are on the lines of the Central Electricity Act, 2003, which was enacted recently in Parliament.

The reforms will also include improvements proposed under the Punjab Electricity Bill, 2003, which was introduced in the Punjab Vidhan Sabha in the last budget session. The power reforms are aimed at providing adequate and quality power at the right price to consumers in the state and unbundling as well as restructuring of the Punjab State Electricity Board (PSEB). The reforms will also create an environment for healthy competition aimed at cutting costs and improving the quality of power supply.

Other than this, the council of ministers also approved a major move for improving the infrastructure of roads and bridges by validating the concession agreement for collection of toll tax and maintenance of the newly improved Ropar-Phagwara road as well as the highlevel river bridge on the Satluj connecting the Jagroan-Nakodar road. The rates of toll tax would be Rs 10 for cars, Rs 15 for buses and trucks including Rs 20 for multi-axle vehicles.

The rates would be increased by Rs 5 each in 2005 and 2007. It was also decided to levy a concessional rate of sales tax at the rate of one per cent on non-conventional renewable energy devices from April 1, 2002, to March 31, 2003, on solar cookers, solar heating panels, bio-gas plants, photo-voltaic cells and panels including wind mills.

2,Cong policy creating mess?,"PATHANKOT: The change in Raman Bhallaâ€™s portfolio from PSIDC chairman to PSEB administrative member and the â€˜â€˜open letterâ€™â€™ of Fatehgarh Churian MLA Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa to chief minister Amarinder Singh casting aspersions on his style of working, have raised questions over the Congress governmentâ€™s policies.

While Randhawa in his letter had also refused to accept the chairmanship of Punsup, Bhalla, a PSIDC defaulter, was first appointed as PSIDC chairman and then shifted to PSEB administrative post. The BJP leaders say that both the incidents speak of the â€˜â€˜messâ€™â€™ in the Congress government. They say that Amarinder Singhâ€™s policy to â€˜â€˜appease his MLAs and party membersâ€™ has also proved futile.

Former BJP ministers Satyapal Saini and Mohal Lal said the Congress government, which had been accusing the Badal government of creating fiscal mess, was infact doing the same. They said that questions raised by Randhawa in his letter had vindicated the stand of BJP government that Congress had not been following any agenda and was adopting anti-people policies.

They said the incidents also reflected on the decision making capacities of the CM and were indicative that dissidence within the Congress against Amarinder would grow. Sources in the Congress, however, said that Randhawaâ€™s letter was nothing but an unruly act. â€˜â€˜This is just a lesson for the CM that all the vocal MLAs should be given a patient hearing in the CLP and other party fora.,â€™â€™ they said. Sources said Randhawa could incur the wrath of the party and the CM on the ground of indisciplinary behaviour.

But with the backing five to seven Congress MLAs from all over the state and a strong lobby support due to his father and former PPCC president Santokh Singh Randhawa, any punitive action against him will recoil on Amarinder, they added. Sukhjinderâ€™s supporters said that not all Congress MLAs, who were given a raw deal, could be so bold to accuse Amarinder in public.

â€˜â€˜The MLA should been given a ministerial berth during the last Cabinet expansion. Since Amarinder did not oblige Sukhjinder and his father, his public outpour was but natural,â€™â€™ they defended. For Raman Bhallaâ€™s supporters too, the CMâ€™s decision came as a bolt. Congress sources said it looked ludicrous when Bhalla reached Chandigarh for coronation as PSEB chairman, but was told that he had been shifted to PSEB administrative post.

3,BSP candidate wins Chiraigaon by-election,"LUCKNOW: The opposition camp suffered a jolt when the Bahujan Samaj Party candidate Virendra Singh won the Chiraigaon vidhan sabha by-election in Varanasi by defeating his nearest Samajwadi Party rival Anil Rajbhar by a margin of 3,510 votes.

With this victory, strength of the BSP has gone up to 111 in the vidhan sabha of 403. A former minister, Singh''s victory over Rajbhar in the keenly contested bypoll has added another feather in chief minister Mayawati''s cap, especially when the opposition parties claimed that the BSP-BJP government had lost the majority in the vidhan sabha. The BSP candidate got 54,648 votes while the Samajwadi Party nominee secured 51,441 votes, said the EC sources.

The Congress nominee got 5,870 votes which was 4.24 per cent of the total polled. The BSP victory percentage was 39.52 while, the SP''s was 37. A notable feature of the poll was that the Apna Dal candidate got 14,308 votes which is 10.35 per cent of the polled votes.

Bypoll for the seat was necessitated following the death of Ranjit Rajbhar of the Samajwadi Party. His son Anil was put up by the Samajwadi Party who had the support of some opposition parties. The poll was held on June 21. Earlier, the poll was to be held on May 21 but was postponed for a month after the Election Commission officials detected violations of the model code of conduct by the ruling contestants.

After the postponement of the poll for a month, the opposition parties had shown some unity and Mulayam Singh Yadav and Kalyan Singh had campaigned for the opposition candidate. The result of this seat was keenly awaited in political circles after the opposition parties joined hands to oust the BSP-BJP government. The opposition had made it a point to state at the election meetings that the BSP-BJP government had lost majority support after the 14-member Rashtriya Lok Dal withdrew its support from the government.

5,Ceilings in Lucknow Development Authority crumble,"LUCKNOW: When the Lucknow Development Authority (LDA) itself faces the dilemma of crumbling ceilings, how will it be accountable to the masses? On Tuesday, LDA officials had to undergo what is a routine thing for its consumers when the ''false-ceiling'' outside the vice-chairman''s new office in Gomtinagar collapsed.

As the word went around, it didn''t take long for the LDA employees to come up with various hypothetical causes that could have caused the bizarre incident. A few even blamed ''rodent menace'' for bringing down the one-and-a-half-year old false ceiling.

However, an employee working on the same floor painted a contradictory picture. ""The ceiling collapse within a short span of a year of its installation points to the usage of inferior quality raw material or, else, negligence in construction."" Referring to the inexplicable happening, vice-chairman Mahesh Kumar Gupta said: ""OP Pandey, a junior engineer, has been suspended and payment to contractors stopped.""

While employees gave various views, the engineers struggled to come up with a concrete cause which might have resulted in the caving in of the false ceiling. Following the unfortunate incident, the damage incurred by the LDA amounts to almost Rs 3 lakh. Chief Engineer Lalit Mehrotra said: ""The factors which might have caused the occurrence are not clear as of now. We are conducting an inquiry which may take a day or two.""

Reacting to the party defeat in the Chiraigaon bypoll, AICC general secretary Subodh Kant Sahay said that it was a victory of ''Mayawati culture'' and failure of the Election Commission as, while polling was going on in the constituency, a good number of BSP ministers were seen camping there.

8,Dutch govt not to fund new projects in state,"HYDERABAD: The Netherlands government has decided not to fund any new projects in Andhra Pradesh. It will, however, continue to provide the promised financial assistance to the ongoing projects.

The Dutch government is one of the major donors for Andhra Pradesh and its current commitments under various projects touches over Rs 1,200 crore. The municipal administration and urban development department (MA&UD) is presently negotiating with the Netherlands government for a Rs 200 crore grant for extending Velugu scheme to 10 more municipalities in the state and expanding the Green Hyderabad Project to more areas.

According to MA&UD sources, Netherlands ambassador in India, P F C Koch had recently wrote a letter to chief secretary Mohan Kanda explaining the reasons for stopping the funding to the state government.

â€œThe Dutch government has spent 0.8 per cent of the GDP on development activities through bilateral and multilateral channels. The downward trend in economic activity affected the Netherlands too,â€� the Ambassador said in his letter.

Koch said, despite these internal developments his government had decided to continue the ongoing activities, â€œbut no major multi-year commitments can be made for the time being.â€� He said the new decision would specifically affect the Dutch governmentâ€™s current involvement in the Andhra Pradesh Economic Reforms Loan (APERL).

The Dutch government also wished to opt out from the APERL activities and conveyed the decision to the state government. Besides MA&UD, the Dutch government is also aiding rural development, water management and sanitation and agricultural research projects in AP. A major chunk of the Dutch funds come in the form of grants.

9,Lok Ayukta probe against 4 ministers,"VIJAYAWADA: Lok Ayukta R Ramanujam said here on Tuesday that he was inquiring into corruption charges against four ministers, two MLAs and a Zilla Parishad chairperson.

He would not reveal their names. At a news conference, Ramanujam said: â€œWe have taken up inquiries against these persons based on newspaper reports. If the charges are established prima facie, we will serve notices to them and summon them.â€�

Apart from corruption charges, the four ministers are also accused of abusing their power, Ramanujam said. He said people are intimidated to testify before the Lok Ayukta against corrupt ministers and officials.

â€œWe will try to provide security to such people if they come forward as witnesses,â€� he said. Ramanujam said there is need to amend the Lok Ayukta Act on the lines of the Karnataka Lok Ayukta Act giving it wider powers and financial independence.

The AP Lok Ayukta Act in its present form lacks teeth, he said. â€œWe have no power even to summon for necessary records or initiate contempt proceedings,â€� Ramanujam said.

Recommendations have been sent to the state government for amending the Act by including 12 provisions, he added.

10,"Chinese firms reluctant about exporting zinc, lead","SHANGHAI: China, a major global zinc and lead exporter, will be reluctant to export both metals for the immediate future because prices are stronger at home, industry officials said on Wednesday.

It is also expected to produce less of both metals in the second half of this year, despite a rise in output in the first five months, due to low treatment charges, they said.

""The zinc market is very quiet now and Chinese firms are not keen to export because domestic prices are better,"" said a senior trader with an Asian trading firm in China.

""For lead, we were negotiating deals with Japan and they failed to materialise because prices were too low,"" he said.

In the first five months of this year, refined zinc exports were down 17.1 per cent year on year at 179,693 tonnes, while refined lead exports fell 13 per cent to 188,462 tonnes, customs figures showed.

Some firms are still exporting because they have to fill long-term contracts, while others preferred to sell within China to makers of galvanised steel and battery manufacturers which need lead, traders said.

Some analysts said SARS might cut domestic zinc demand by a marginal 20,000 tonnes in 2003 from the 1.8 million tonnes last year, although overall usage remained strong. They kept estimates for lead demand at about 1.1 million tonnes.

""SARS has had some impact on certain zinc-using industries, especially in the hardware business in the southern part of China,"" said Feng Juncong of state-backed Beijing Antaike Information Co.

""SARS didn''t quite hit the battery-making sector,"" she added.

SLOWER OUTPUT IN H2

Analysts also said it would be tough for Chinese producers to keep up the zinc and lead production growth of the first five months.

From January to May, zinc output rose four per cent 861,500 tonnes, while lead production grew nine percent to 555,700 tonnes, according to customs figures.

""It will be hard to maintain that kind of pace and we might see production falling in the second half of this year. Concentrates will still be a problem,"" Feng said.

Overall supply remains tight although a concentrate squeeze has eased somewhat after some smaller mines re-opened in the southern region of Guangxi after restructuring, traders said.

""For zinc, the situation is slightly better. But lead concentrate supply remains quite tight,"" said a trader based in Hong Kong.

Analysts said smelters were unwilling to import concentrates due to low treatment charges - paid by overseas mines to domestic producers to make the refined metal.

""We don''t see much appetite for concentrate imports because treatment charges are very low and some of the producers can''t take it,"" said a trader with China Minmetals Group.

""We haven''t heard of any more shutdowns after Baiyin, but we might see more cutbacks,"" he said.

Earlier this year, Baiyin Non-ferrous Metals closed its key 100,000 tonnes-per-year line because of a concentrates shortage.

Traders said mines were willing to offer zinc treatment charges of only around $135 a tonne, but most Chinese producers wanted $145-$150.

For lead, treatment charges are at a low $60-$65 a tonne, compared to $80-$90 late last year.

""For the past two months, China''s purchase of imported lead concentrates has slowed. It may be because they already bought a lot in the first quarter,"" the Hong Kong trader said.

11,Venue of BSP rally shifted under govt pressure,"CHANDIGARH: Bowing to pressure from Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Mayawati has decided to shift the venue of the proposed Davit rally from Jalandhar to Chandigarh.

The Davit rally, which was earlier slated for July 7 in Jalandhar to protest alleged police excesses on Dalits in Talhan village, which remained under curfew for about a fortnight, would now be held in Chandigarh on July 15.

Talking to mediapersons here on Wednesday, senior BSP leader from Uttar Pradesh Narinder Kumar Kashyap described the Punjab Chief Minister''s objections to the proposed BSP rally as ""undemocratic and unconstitutional"".

Asserting that the BSP never favoured disturbing the law and order situation, Kashyap regretted that Amarinder Singh''s refusal to allow the BSP rally had come after the Jalandhar district administration had granted its permission for it.

Punjab chief secretary Rajan Kashyap had also written a letter to his Uttar Pradesh counterpart on Tuesday suggesting that the Mayawati rally might be avoided in Jalandhar in view of the tense law and order situation there.

12,IRDA favours unified law for managing disasters,"NEW DELHI: Favouring a unified legislation for disaster management, Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) on Wednesday said it will discuss with insurers a mechanism whereby municipalities could be empowered to collect premium for covering risks associated with major calamities.

""We will discuss with the insurers about the mandatory premium that can be collected by municipalities for covering risks of calamities,"" IRDA chairman C S Rao said on the sidelines of a Ficci-World Bank seminar.

Although the various bodies like municipalities, state governments or the Centre can be entrusted with the collection of the premium, Rao said it is ultimately the insurance companies which would cover the risks.

Referring to the Tenth Five Year Plan, he said there was a need for a unified legislation for disaster management.

""It should clearly define what constitutes a disaster at the national level and what should be the role of different agencies in relief efforts,"" he said.

In view of the current division of responsibilities between states and the Centre, he said ""there is a need to create a body of legislation dealing with response to natural disasters and other emergencies, clearly delineating responsibilities and powers of each entity and specifying what powers or actions would need to be activated on declaration of a disaster by government.""

He said the legislation should also include laws dealing with chemical disasters.

Former IRDA chairman N Rangachary said certain risks should compulsorily be insured by either municipalities or other agencies. Rangachary said there was a need to create a ""insurance pool"" for disaster management.

In this context, he said insurers should be allowed to create a Catastrophe Reserve and exempt it from tax. ""I had suggested this to the then Finance Minister (Yashwant Sinha) in 2002. He had agreed but something went wrong somewhere and it did not come in the Budget for 2002,"" he said.

To create a fund, Rangachary also proposed issue of Catastrophe Bonds by government, which would be subscribed by the insurers.

13,Police lathicharge rallyists in Shimla,"SHIMLA: Police lathicharged rallyists at the gathering addressed by former chief minister of Himachal Pradesh and senior BJP leader Prem Kumar Dhumal at the Ridge Maidan here on Wednesday afternoon.

State BJP spokesman Ganesh Dutt Dhumal, Mahila Morcha president Indu Goswami and MLA Virendra Kumar were among those injured. Dhumal, however, was not injured in the lathicharge.

The BJP has alleged that the attack was unprovoked. The rally was held to protest the ""draconian"" polices of the Congress government in the state, which completed 100 days on Wednesday.

BJP leaders and workers were rounded up and taken to the outskirts of the city before being let off. However, the protestors managed to stop at Tunnel 103 and block traffic for about half an hour.

Fourteen legislators of the party left the Vidhan Sabha where the Budget session was on, after Question Hour, and went to the Ridge maidan, where other party leaders and workers were waiting for them.

Apart from Dhumal, state BJP chief Jai Krishan Sharma, former ministers J P Nadda, Narendra Bragta and R D Kashyap and other party legislators were present at the rally.

As party leaders were addressing the gathering, the police began lathicharging them without warning, claiming that the BJP was violating Section 144, which was in force at the maidan.

It was not clear who ordered the lathicharge. The Shimla police chief denied that there was any lathicharge on the rallyists and said that there was only a ""minor scuffle"" between the police and BJP workers. Deputy commissioner SBKS Negi also denied the lathicharge.

Dhumal told newspersons that the police action was ""against all norms of democracy."" He said that they were to call on the governor to hand over a memorandum to him against the state government after the meeting.

Alleging that the ""brutal lathicharge"" on peaceful demonstrators was an attack on democracy, he said that Virendra Kanwar was forcibly taken away by over a dozen policemen. ""The incident reminds me of June 25, 1975, when besides Loknayak Jaiprakash Narain, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Lal Krishan Advani and a host of other leaders were forcibly taken to jail"", he added.

The DC claimed that some police personnel were injured when the BJP leaders ""incited party workers to attack the police, who were trying to round up the demonstrators and take them to the waiting vehicles.""

He said that Nihal Chand, a constable who had been posted in the region, was seriously injured and he had been taken to hospital for medical treatment. ""There was no intention to arrest any one, but as Section 144 was in force on the Ridge, we only wanted to remove them from there"", he added.

Negi said that cases had been registered against some BJP leaders and workers, but did not divulge names.

The state unit of the BJP proposes to hold demonstrations till July 10 in different parts of the state.
