0,"O Brother, Punjabi flavour rules Amritsar","AMRITSAR:Pizzas may be in, but it is the mouth watering delicacies like Amritsari â€œkulchasâ€�, â€œSarson Ka Saagâ€�, butter chicken and Amritsari fish that are a favourite with the foodies here, and are able to satiate the Punjabisâ€™ hearty appetites. And the dhaba culture remains a winner.

While most dhabas continue to cater to the Punjabi palette and have dedicated customers, a couple of enterprising ones have also added junk food to their menus to please customers with slightly more exotic tastes.

But fast food giants have nevertheless been able to secure a fairly sizeable number of patrons. Pizza Hut, Dominoâ€™s, Burger King, My Kind of Place, Beeâ€™s, Pizza Land are some of those with outlets here.

Bharawan Da Dhaba, one of cityâ€™s famous food joint serving â€œparantha and dalâ€�, has branched off to pizzas and burghers under the new label of â€œBrotherâ€™sâ€�. In contrast, other famous dhabas like Kesar Ka Dhaba have stuck to traditional fare.

A brisk business in pizzas, noodles, burgers and pasta is being done even by the rehri-wallas. With sales worth few hundred to a thousand rupees a day, they cater to the fast food crazy consumers from the lower strata of society.

Plaza hotel general manager PK Vaid said: â€œWe are trying to change the eating habits of Amritsaris by holding Chinese, Rajasthani, Kashmiri food festivals.

We are trying to introduce different Indian cuisines to those craving for quality food.â€� Similarly, Vivek of Bharawan Da Dhaba said that they chose to transform a part of the dhaba into a fast food joint called Brotherâ€™s because they didnâ€™t want to lose customers who wanted to try pizzas or burgers.

Tourists visiting Amritsar prefer â€œparanthasâ€� to pizzas since they do not want to miss the opportunity to try out Amritsari paranthas, dal, â€œsarson da sagâ€�. â€œWe serve junk food since it is a favourite with children. But, traditional fare remains the first choice of our customers,â€� points out Vivek.

Reflecting the change in preferences, Pizza Hut manager Kanwal said that even the die-hard traditionalists have now at least started experimenting with other kind of food. â€œPeople want to dine out and taste pasta, and become regulars once they develop the taste,â€� he said. In this race, Amritsari â€œkulchasâ€� are not losing out either. Vendors have started offering kulchas with modern packing at an additional cost, which in turn has been attracting customers in large numbers.

But medical practitioners caution against the switch over to junk food which they say leads to various health problems including obesity among children.

1,Prohibition policy fails in tribal areas,"AHMEDABAD: Anyone who has been to the eastern belt of Gujarat would not have realised that this is a â€˜dryâ€™ state which still swears by Gandhian ideals. With the aroma of â€˜mahudaâ€™ and â€˜tadiâ€™ brews filling the air, the abject failure of the prohibition policy in Gujarat canâ€™t be more emphatically felt than in this nearly 700-km stretch inhabited mainly by tribals.

And now, a study carried out by Gujarat Vidyapithâ€™s Tribal Research Centre TRC) for the government makes it official. The prohibition laws are too simplistic and totally out of sync with the culture of the tribal population in the state. The study, titled â€˜Effectiveness of excise policy in tribal areas (with reference to prohibition)â€™, was commissioned by the Government of India last year.

The report, now lying with the state government, is expected to be sent to the Centre soon. The study was ordered essentially to evaluate the performance of excise and prohibition departments in the tribal regions vis-Ã -vis their effectiveness in implementing the policy.

The study also investigated how the central government allocation to the tune of Rs 20 lakh every year is spent on awareness campaigns as part of the prohibition policy. â€œThe findings of the study reveal that the ban has done little to change the drinking habits of the tribal population in the stateâ€™s eastern belt. This is because the policy fails to associate alcoholism among tribals with issues such as unemployment and starvation,â€� says TRC director Chandrakant Upadhyay.

Citing a paradox, Arun Patel â€” who conducted the study â€” said, â€œOn one hand, there is a blanket ban on alcohol. And on the other, liquor manufacturing units are flourishing in certain tribal regions such as in the stretch between Bardoli and Vyara. â€˜Desiâ€™ liquor units are run by tribals under the very nose of the police,â€� he said, adding, â€œAs it is the only means of living for many tribals, authorities often turn a blind eye willingly.â€�

W h e n asked to comment on the findings of the report, tribal welfare commissioner Ramaji Rai said, â€œI have yet to see the report and can only comment once I read the contents.â€� Minister of state for prohibition and home Amit Shah was unavailable for his comments. The report also points out that prohibition is relaxed in these areas during elections. Madhusudan Mistry, the Congress MP from Sabarkantha, agrees with the view that liquor is used as an effective tool to glean tribal votes. â€œBut, this is a problem of lack of effective policing.

If the ruling party does not have a vested interest, it would put a clamp on liquor supply during elections,â€� he said. He also rued that prohibition was not implemented with a humane face. â€œThe government should make more economic options available for tribals to curb alcoholism,â€� he added. Vadodara-based tribal activist Ganesh Devy said it is time the government admitted that the policy has gone wrong and needs to be revised. â€œBanning a traditional drink like â€˜mahudaâ€™, consumed during festivals, is side-stepping the issue. Alcoholism stemming from socioeconomic issues is what the government should be targeting,â€� he said. He also said that the cause of tribals will be served properly if the allocation for policy implementation is used for the upliftment of tribal population instead.

2,NID students call for dialogue on riots through films,"VADODARA: The moving frames of animated capsules made by two students of the National Institute of Design NID) left everyone present in the audience thinking. On Saturday, the first screenings of the films were held at MS Universityâ€™s faculty of fine arts.

A five-minute animation film titled Dharamveerâ€™ by Pravin Mishra is an interpretation of how fanaticism manifests into collective hate and overrides logic. Another 22-minute film, â€˜Yusuf Ke liyeâ€™ For Yusuf), by Nirmala Nair is a story of Yusuf Mansuri, who was arrested in Narodagam during the communal riots. Both the films call for a debate on the need to speak out against violence.

â€œMy film revolves around Dharamveer, a common man at the crossroads who is under utter confusion. He is caught in conflicts owing to the multi-ethnic and cultural fabric of India. Then, he is taken into the storm by roving forces of fundamentalism and conditioned to be one among them. He soon begins to assume that he is a warrior and chooses violence to peace,â€� says Pravin Mishra, a student of animation film design at NID.

For Nair, the film is a tribute to the undying spirit of Yusuf, who was actively involved in relief and rehabilitation of his community members in the post-Godhra scenario. â€œThe film portrays Yusuf through his family and friends and explores the insecurities of people belonging to the minority community,â€� says Nair, a student of film and video communication at NID.

If Mishra captured many frames of the deserted streets of Ahmedabad during the 2002 riots, Nair highlighted the internal turmoil of Yusuf, who strongly adheres to doctrines of peace and harmony against all odds. The films are meant to evoke reaction from the present generation, say the amateur designers. â€œI am planning to visit as many colleges and institutions as possible to reach out to a maximum number of thinking individuals. As a designer, my concern is to create a medium to provide solutions to problems rather than just reliving the horrors through artistic expression,â€� reasons Mishra, referring to the objective of his mission. â€˜Dharamveerâ€™ was made using the cell animation technique, which Mishra decided was just right to bring out the right emotion and action.

â€œIn animation, it is important to convey the maximum in less time. It has to be a crisp and clear image conveying a whole lot of emotions. I have blended animation and video footages of Behrampura and Naroda-Patia areas during the riots. Itâ€™s an effort to simplify the complex issue, yet give enough space for interpretation,â€� explains Mishra, who has used a lot of symbolic expression in the film that can help people identify themselves with the character.

The faculty has the largest number of students on the campus and all leaders made it a point to remain present at its entrance to welcome students coming for the first time to the campus. The NSUI, which performed dismally in the MSUSU and faculty-level student association polls last year, has already finalised its candidates for the MSUSU vice-presidentâ€™s post.

Current MSUSU general secretary Rutvij Joshi will contest the polls for NSUI. Also, the NSUI is contemplating to make Vikki Shah their candidate for the post of faculty general secretary (FGS) of the commerce faculty. District NSUI president Prakash Verma said that they were still in the process of finalising the candidate for the post of the MSUSU general secretary. â€œSeveral students, including those from our rival camps, have expressed willingness to contest the polls. We are adopting a wait and watch approach for the second seat,â€� he said.

The ABVP and other likeminded leaders are still holding their cards close to the chest. â€œThere are several candidates who are capable of contesting the polls. Who has to contest at what post will be decided by us soon,â€� said a student leader from the camp. The names of Dharmendra Panchal, Vikas Dubey, Jigat Thakkar and Jignesh Rao are making rounds in the campus as probable candidates from the group. Said ABVP state general secretary Bharat Dangar, â€œWe will deliberate at length at the organisational level and only then take a final decision. Let the notification be out first.â€�

4,"Chief justice against north Karnataka HC bench, says govt","BANGALORE: Karnataka High Court chief justice N.K. Jain has ruled out constitution of a HC bench in north Karnataka. The decision has been conveyed to the state government. The cabinet discussed CJâ€™s letter at its meeting on Saturday. â€œBut we will urge the CJ to reconsider the decision.

Chief minister S.M. Krishna will meet him soon and take up the matter,â€™â€™ law and parliamentary affairs minister D.B. Chandre Gowda told reporters after the meeting. A seven-judge committee, headed by justice G.C. Bharuka (who retired recently), had been set up to look into the demand for a high court bench in north Karnataka. The committee submitted the report to the chief justice sometime back.

â€œWe are not aware of the report findings. We have only received a letter from the CJ,â€™â€™ Gowda said. Extracts from the letter written by the CJ read out by Gowda are: â€œI am of the considered opinion that in the absence of basic criteria, constitution of a bench away from the principal seat (high court in Bangalore), is not necessary at the present.â€™â€™ Asked if the government could approach President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam for the bench, Gowda said there was no such provision.

â€œThe President may consider a bench only if there is a recommendation from the high court CJ. The governor and the CJ will be consulted by the President before any decision is taken,â€™â€™ he said. The justice Bharuka committee was constituted in 2002 after a delegation led by the chief minister called on the chief justice.

5,Cabinet okays rules to absorb rural weightage staff,"BANGALORE: The Karnataka Cabinet on Saturday approved special rules framed to absorb 4,800 employees, who will lose their jobs as per a Supreme Court order scrapping their selection on rural weightage basis.

The rules â€” Karnataka Civil Services Absorption of Persons Appointed to Civil Services Under Rural Weightage Benefits 2003 â€” will be published soon inviting objections. â€œWe want to reiterate that the government will protect interests of all the 4,800 employees.

The posts that have fallen vacant after discharging 4,800 staff would be filled with merit candidates. But it is only after two petitions filed before the Supreme Court are disposed of. The affected employees had urged the apex court to reconsider its decision on humanitarian grounds, while merit candidates filed a contempt petition seeking the courtâ€™s directive to the government to employ them on merit basis. Gowda urged merit candidates to withdraw their petition to help recruitment of affected candidates. â€œItâ€™ll be of assistance to either parties.â€™â€™

7,Lucknow News - Times of India,"LUCKNOW: The government, it seems, is indifferent towards improvement of patient care facilities in the state medical colleges.

Or, else, how can one explain that neither the medical education minister Lalji Verma, nor senior officials of the medical education department, who were invited as â€˜special guestsâ€™, came to attend the UP Medical College Teachersâ€™ Association conference at the CSMMU on Saturday.

Some teachers, however, were also of the view that by their absence, government officials had indicated that orders to strictly deal with private practice by medical teachers would not be taken back.

Interestingly, teachers disclosed that as many as three senior IAS officers called up an oncology surgeon and a paediatric surgeon, during the conference, to make request of seeing their relatives at private clinics. When asked why not hospitals, these officers told the surgeons that they did not want their kin to be exposed to the unhygienic and poor infrastructure of the hospital.

10,Bihar govt wants financial year to start from June,"PATNA: The state government has made a strong plea before visiting court commissioner N C Saxena that the financial cut-off date be extended to June from March each year.

Saxena, a retired IAS officer appointed by the Supreme Court to assess the progress made by the state government in the implementation of various centrally-sponsored poverty alleviation programmes, returned to Delhi on Sunday after having detailed discussion with officials, including chief secretary K A H Subramanian.

According to sources, the state government, while presenting its case before Saxena during his four-day visit, said most of the districts are totally in the grip of floods from July till November. During this period, no construction or earthwork is possible in the interiors of flood-affected districts, the government is learnt to have said.

""It is increasingly difficult for officials to send a proposal during this period to the Centre in this extreme period of crisis,"" said a senior government official.

Saxena, who is likely to submit his detailed report on Bihar to the Supreme Court, is learnt to have agreed to the proposal of the Bihar government to extend the financial cut-off date to June in order to utilise the centrally- sponsored schemes within stipulated period of time.

Inquiries revealed that the Centre deducts the amount from the allocated fund in case of late submission of proposal from the state government. If the government submits its proposal after December, the Centre deducts 10 per cent share of the estimated amount. Similarly, after March, the deducation rate becomes much higher by 25 per cent.

To save this allocated amount, the Bihar government has made a strong plea before Saxena to consider the proposal regarding extension of the financial year to June to achieve optimum utilisation of funds.

Saxena is learnt to have expressed his satisfaction on the work done in his four-day Bihar visit. He has lauded the achievements of Bihar in pulse polio programme. Compared to neighbouring Uttar Pradesh, Bihar had done a remarkable job without any sex discrimination. In UP, the pulse polio programme has got communally motivated, said an official.

The state government has decided to introduce first phase of mid-day scheme in 10 districts (in three blocks of each of the districts) from September 1 for primary school students. The government has already allocated a sum of Rs 11 crore for supplying cooked food to the students, an official informed Saxena in the meeting.

11,BJP lists Rabri govt's failure before N C Saxena,"PATNA: Following denial of appointments from court commissioner N C Saxena, chief whip of BJP, the main opposition party in the state legislative assembly on Sunday issued an open letter. The letter addressed to Saxena consists of figures of physical performance of centrally sponsored poverty alleviation programmes namely Jawahar Rojgar Yojana, Sunischit Rojgar Yojana, Indira Awas, Food For Work, Annapurna Yojana, figures of monthly allotment and off take of wheat and rice under TPDS, Antyodaya and other schemes as a proof of dismal performance of the state government.

The letter was formally released to the media at state BJP headquarters here on Sunday.

Quoting figures from these statistics Sinha has written that Bihar was receiving on an average Rs. 1600 crore per annum from centre for poverty alleviation programme since 1992-93. But it could not yield favourable results. He has said that the population below poverty level in the state was 40 per cent in the year 1990-91 which increased to 42.8 per cent in the year 2001 and further 56 per cent in the year 2003. The number of poor families in the state was 65 lakhs in the year 1992-93 which rose to 95 lakhs in the year 1998-99, say the letter.

He has further added that the state government''s claim of issuing red cards to Rs 65 lakh families were found to be issued on forged names. As a result all red cards were cancelled and till date no fresh cards have been issued to genuine beneficiaries.

The state government has failed to identify 10 lakh poor families to be issued white cards for being provided subsidised food grains under Antyodaya Anna Yojana. Even identification of beneficiaries has not been done. However; the state government is receiving 21000 metric tonnes wheat and 14,000 metric ton rice per annum under this scheme since last four years.

The letter also says that there was vast gap between the opening and closing balances of Jawahar Rojgar Yojana, Sunischit Rojgar Yojana and Indira Awas Yojana during the period between 1994-95 to 1998-99.

The letter also find mention of state government''s failure in identifying beneficiaries of Annapurna Yojana, not spending Rs. 104.16 crores of Jawahar Rojagar Yojana fund and Rs. 43.59 crore Sunischit Rojgar Yojana fund during the financial year 2000-01. The state was deprived of Rs. 700 crore under these two schemes in the same year as it could not submit utility certificate.

State government too failed in spending Rs. 181.24 crore and Rs. 154.76 crore respectively under Jawahar Gram Samriddhi Yojana and Sunischit Rojgar Yojana in the year 2001-02.
