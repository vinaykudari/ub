0,Patients protest meal charges at hospitals,"KOLKATA: Around a thousand patients in hospital wards at National Medical College, R.G.Kar, S.S.K.M and Calcutta Medical College refused to take food from the newly appointed contractors. At NRS, relatives of the patients handed leaflets to hospital visitors and NRS authorities later declared that the patients would be given all their meals on Friday free of charge.

From Friday, hospitals throughout the city introduced diet charges on paying patients. Besides, the decision to hand over food supply in government run hospitals to private catering agencies has been opposed by the Haspatal-O-Janaswasthya Raksha committee.

""Medicine and diet are correlated. How can private caterers ensure that diet specifications are maintained for particular patients. The private caterers will be guided by profit motives. This is a covert move by hospital authorities to absolve themselves of any responsibility,"" Tarun Mandal, secretary of the committee told TNN on Friday.

Further, the committee has demanded that all indoor patients in government hospitals be given improved scientific diet free of cost. In addition hospital kitchens and kitchen employees be disciplined and be properly trained to serve the right kind of diet to the patients.

Similar views were echoed by a young house surgeon outside National Medical College hospital. "" Earlier attending physicians could question the kitchen staff if the quality of the food was substandard. Now it will be difficult to fix responsibility because the staff will be directly answerable to the contractors,"" he quipped.

Rabin Ghosh, who has bagged the contract to run hospital kitchens at NRS, R.G. Kar and CMC, says the fuss is misplaced.

1,Katiyar: BJP may opt for fresh polls,"LUCKNOW: Confusion over the fate of coalition government continued as the two main parties in the ongoing dissident drama - the BJP rebels and the party high command - failed to arrive at any understanding.

A rankled Vinay Katiyar, the BJP state president, even hinted at the possibility of dissolution of the Assembly.

He told the media on Friday ""the party may decide to opt for fresh polls rather than allow mass-scale horse trading as planned by the SP"".

Ruling out any threat to the government, Katiyar dismissed the claims of SP supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav that the arithmetic did not favour the coalition.

""Congress has not supported them and the 12 MLAs who met the governor on Thursday gave nothing in writing. All this proves that the government still enjoys majority in the House,"" he declared on Friday.

Efforts are on to bring back the truant legislators into the party fold, Katiyar claimed, tactfully avoiding the question if any disciplinary action was being planned against the 12 BJP rebels who had called on the governor on Thursday.

On Friday, senior party leaders held several rounds of meetings with the high commandâ€™s emissary Kushabhau Thakre, who is still camping in the city.

The BJP spokesperson claimed that such efforts were partially successful, as some of the dissidents finally took the initiative of meeting Thakre and Katiyar.

However, the rebelâ€™s leader Ganga Bhakt Singh vehemently denied this claim. ""No dissident MLA is trying for a truce,"" he told the TNN. Singh also called on the governor on Friday and lodged a formal protest against the alleged harassment of the dissidents by Mayawati government at the behest of the senior BJP leaders.

Making light of the peace attempts by Thakre, Singh said that the senior leader is extremely unhappy at the way the crisis has been handled by the state leaders. He also expressed reservation at the way Thakre was monopolised by a section of leadership while the dissidents were kept out of the scene deliberately.

2,LU squirms at having to play 'Yes minister',"LUCKNOW: Who decides what should be taught to students in universities - teachers, the academic council, the University Grants Commission or ministers?

In the case of the subject Rashtra Gaurav, it has been the minister who laid the foundation, guidelines and framework for the course curriculum, with specific instructions and left it to the university academicians to do the ''clerical job'' of compiling the course material.

Although the final draft of the syllabus was approved by the deans of Lucknow University on Friday, there was resentment among the teachers regarding the manner in which, the minister''s dictums were imposed on the university.

To be introduced as a compulsory subject at the under-graduate level, the syllabus has been divided into 11 chapters on ancient Indian culture, art, traditions, architecture, agriculture and science including texts from the Vedas and Puranas.

With a special stress on the concepts, which were first developed in India, lessons on astrology, ancient vaastu shastra, India''s ancient universities, Hindu mathematics, astronomy, chemistry, botany, zoology, mining and metallurgy as prevalent in ancient India, ayurveda, ancient techniques of agriculture and farming, ancient literature and languages, have also been included.

Although a threadbare analysis of the syllabus is yet to be done by the teachers, as LU has not yet formally released the text, however, after going through the initial reports, the teachers are quite ""perturbed"" and ""apprehensive"" about the emphasis being laid on ""ancient India"", in the curriculum. ""Is only the ancient era glorious and not the contributions made during the mediaeval and modern period,"" questioned a teacher.

Another reason for discontent has been the syllabus earlier prepared by LU, which was rejected by the minister on the grounds that it was too personalised and individualistic. Teachers said that instead of taking the approval of the minister, the LU authorities should have placed the draft before the Academic Council.

LU officers however, said that due care has been taken to ensure that nothing controversial is included in the syllabus and the text is acceptable to all sections of society.

Pleading helplessness, they said that they have to abide by the directions of the minister.

They said the entire syllabus would be taught in 30 lectures and the deans of faculties of arts and science were asked to identify teachers who could teach the topics in the classroom. Since the university cannot bear the expenditure, financial help has been sought from state government for this purpose.

""Teachers of associated colleges are demanding extra remuneration for teaching. We would also require huge amounts of money to publish over 80,000 copies of the syllabus, which have to be distributed to students of LU and its 28 associated colleges, said a senior university officials, adding, that if the government does nothing to provide help, the syllabus would be put on sale at the ''cost price''.

3,RJD-Cong ministers’ standoff continues,"PATNA: Even as the standoff between three Congress junior ministers belonging to the minority community and the RJD leadership continues, the development is being viewed as a fallout of the â€œworking environmentâ€� of 1, Anne Marg rather than a conflict between the two allies.

While RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav described the event as an â€œinternal matterâ€� of the Congress, Choudhary Mahmood Ali Qaiser, one of the three ministers to have offered to quit, speaking to mediapersons stated that he was not willing to work under the present working conditions. â€œI have held talks with the party high command, the three ministers, RJD chief and the chief minister. I am hopeful that the matter will be resolved within a few days,â€� said BPCC chief Shakeel Ahmad.

The three Congress ministers still swear by the Congress high command and insist that they would stick to its decision. Congressmen point out that two of the ministers â€” Qaiser and Mohd Javed â€” are sons of powerful cabinet ministers during the Congress regime.

â€œThey have seen the dignity and power associated with ministers. Now, when they have become ministers themselves, they feel helplessness,â€� pointed out a Congress leader.

Incidentally, one of the ministers felt ignored by the SP of his district when he wanted to talk to him about a murder case. The SP did not even bother to call back. It was only after he pleaded for help in 1, Anne Marg that the SP perused his case.

However, political circles in Patna point out that the feeling of â€œhelplessnessâ€� and â€œpowerlessnessâ€� among ministers of state is not confined to the Congress.

Monajir Hassan of the RJD, who is the junior minister of youth and culture department, finds himself helpless against his senior minister Ashok Singh and complains that not a single file reaches him. More recently, the state has witnessed a war of words between health minister Shakuni Choudhary and his junior minister Akhilesh Singh over a file.

Most of the 32 ministers of state are faceless. They seldom come to their offices or are allotted files by their senior ministers. â€œItâ€™s only ministers close to Laloo, like Shyam Rajak, Akhilesh Singh, Ashok Choudhary who get their share of power,â€� remarked a cabinet minister.

4,HC for contempt notice against top govt officials,"PATNA: The single bench of Justice R S Garg of the Patna High Court on Friday ordered initiation of contempt proceedings against chief secretary, home commissioner, DGP, urban development secretary, state housing board managing director and Patna DM and SP for not preparing an action plan for the removal of encroachments from the Digha land of the Bihar State Housing Board (BSHB).

The HC had passed the order on September 16 and had directed the officials concerned to comply with its order. The officials were present in the court. The court directed them to re-appear before the bench on November 20 with the action plan.

On the letter patent appeal (LPA) filed by the state government against the September 16 order of Justice Garg, a division bench of the high court presided by Chief Justice Ravi S Dhavan on Friday refused to stay that order and reserved its own order in the matter.

â€œShould the state government be allowed to play fraud with the high court? By not submitting an action plan and filing an LPA, the state government has taken the high court for a ride,â€� Justice Garg noted in his order.

On September 16, the Advocate General (AG), appearing personally in the court in the presence of all the government officials concerned, had sought a monthâ€™s time from Justice Garg to prepare the governmentâ€™s action plan for the removal of encroachments from 1,024 acres of Digha land acquired by the state government and handed over to the BSHB in 1984.

The judge had granted the time. On Friday, when the government officials mentioned appeared before the single bench of Justice Garg without any action plan, an order for the initiation of contempt proceedings of the court was passed.

The officials concerned pointed out that an LPA in the said matter was pending before the division bench. In the LPA filed by the state government before the division bench comprising Chief Justice and Justice R N Prasad against the September 16 order, the division bench refused to stay the order of the single bench and kept its own order in the matter reserved.

The CJ asked government pleader R K Datta to explain why he, instead of appearing before the single bench judge with the action plan after the state government had already been granted a monthâ€™s time for the same, filed an LPA in the matter.

Incidentally, on September 11, 1987, a division bench of Justice L M Sharma and Justice Yadunath Sharan Singh had directed the state government and the registration department to see that no registry of 1,024 acres of the land concerned is done.

The court had also said if the registration to â€œoutsidersâ€� (meaning persons who are not allottees of the said land) is done through fraudulent means then that registration should be cancelled.

Its order was also that the state government and the BSHB should see that no further encroachment on the land is made.

But despite the court order, some plots of the land concerned were sold illegally by original owners to â€œoutsidersâ€�, allegedly in connivance with the government and BSHB officials, and no action was taken either by the state government or the BSHB.

Most of the 8,000 allottees, who had deposited the required amount with the BSHB in 1972 and received agreement papers, are â€œon the roadâ€�, while â€œoutsidersâ€� who had encroached the land and constructed concrete houses on it have been living â€œpeacefullyâ€� in their houses since 1977, the record says. Senior lawyer Shravan Kumar appeared on behalf of the BSHB.

5,Independent MLA Ansari extends support to govt,"LUCKNOW: Independent MLA Mukhtar Ansari has sent a letter to governor Vishnu Kant Shastri saying that he supported the coalition government.

In his letter sent to chief minister Mayawati, Ansari said that keeping in view the efforts of some opportunists to destabilise the government, he had decided to extend his full support to the government and work under the leadership of Mayawati throughout his life.

He said that he was well acquainted with the opportunistic and cheap politics indulged in by the Samajwadi Party. He said that the SP claimed itself to be well-wisher of Muslims but did nothing for their welfare.

Ansari said that he was obliged to Mayawati, who had left a distinct mark on him by bestowing her affection, and he greatly respected her. He said that the people of the state wanted the farsighted leadership of Mayawati so that her government could work for their welfare for a long time.

In these circumstances, the letter said, he had decided to extend his support to the government and requested Mayawati for his inclusion in the BSP list of supporters, promising to fulfil any responsibility assigned to him with honesty and sincerity.

Ansari said he would play an active role in foiling the efforts of opportunists to destabilise the government.

Mayawati has accepted the request of Ansari and included his name in the list of BSP supporters, according to a party press release.

6,Dismiss Maya govt: SC lawyer,"LUCKNOW: Senior Supreme Court lawyer PC Srivastava on Friday urged governor Vishnukant Shastri to immediately dismiss the Mayawati-led BSP-BJP coalition government in the state.

""The government is in a minority and has no moral right to continue,"" Srivastava said, adding that allowing such a minority government was a violation of the Constitutional provision.

Srivastava, during his stay in the capital, also held meetings with former chief minister Kalyan Singh and BJP dissident leader Ganga Bhakt Singh. Not only an eminent lawyer of the apex court, Srivastava is also well known in the state politics.

It was he who had caused worry for the BJP by filing his nomination for the keenly-contested Rajya Sabha election in 2000 with the support of the BJP allies, including 19 ministers and one MLA. He, however, later withdrew from the fray.

Commenting on the prevailing political situation, he said the Mayawati government had lost majority after withdrawal of support by nearly two dozen legislators, including those of the BJP.

The entire scenario had now changed and Mayawati no longer enjoyed the confidence, which she had proved by securing 217 votes as against the requisite number of 202 during the trial of strength some five months ago on the floor of the House.

In such a situation, it was a duty cast upon the governor to act under the constitutional provision. The governor was thus duty-bound to direct Mayawati to prove her majority on the floor of the House, instead of acting on the assumptions, Srivastava added.

In support of his contention, Srivastava recalled the incident of 1967 when an identical situation was created after Chaudhary Charan Singh crossed the floor along with 17 legislators.

As a consequence, the then government headed by CB Gupta fell in minority. Gupta, on his part, preferred to resign instead of indulging in horse-trading. This led to the formation of a coalition government headed by Chaudhry Charan Singh.

Srivastava said that the governor should take a lesson from this precedent and explore the possibility of forming an alternative government. And the obvious choice was no body else except the Samajwadi Party leader Mulayam Singh Yadav, who is the leader of the single largest party and has also the number game in his favour, he said.

In the political drama, the BJP was the worst sufferer, which had got thoroughly exposed, Shrivastava said added that its claim that it was a party with a difference had turned out to be a hollowed one.

People were fed up with its politics of permutation and combination and it was the reason that it had faced internal contradictions, he said.

7,Towards incident-free journeys,"PUNE: One good thing about getting off a train in Pune (or even Shivajinagar for that matter) is the presence of the pre-paid auto rickshaw service.

Unlike other stations, passengers no longer need to worry about being taken for a ride by unscrupulous elements.

However, stations in and around have their own set of evils. The deplorable prank of pelting of stones at passengers in speeding trains is on the rise. And so is the incidence of bag-lifting, aggravated by inadequate patrolling of railway platforms and premises.

Let''s look at the good part first. Passengers whole-heartedly endorse the pre-paid rickshaw scheme. Mumbaiite Mansur Sheikh, a frequent visitor to the city, told TNN, ""I always use the prepaid scheme. I don''t mind paying more for some peace of mind. In so many other cities, rickshawmen have given me a hard time with their efforts to squeeze extra fare.""

In fact, one of the rickshawmen who is a regular at the pre-paid booth, recently returned a bag left behind by a passenger, reveals deputy commissioner of police (DCP-traffic) Ravindra Sengaonkar said.

""More than 2,100 passengers take advantage of the facility every day, but the number needs to grow as many passengers are still not aware of it. We plan to put up a large hoarding at the station making passengers aware of the system,"" the senior officer added, while expressing the intention of cracking down on rickshawmen who try to bypass the pre-paid scheme.

Speaking with TNN superintendent of police (SP-railways) Vijay Chavan said, ""The biggest problem we face is that of bag-lifting. It is very difficult to detect the crime as it often takes place at an earlier station, which sometimes is in another state. But the complaint is in lodged our jurisdiction. We have increased out night patrols to nab bag-lifters.""

This has reduced the incidence of bag-lifting from 356 in 2000 to 302 in 2001 and just 250 till October 31 in 2002, he claimed. ""Kurduwadi in the Solapur section and Wathar on the Kolhapur line are notorious for dacoity attempts on full moon and new moon nights. We have been deploying armed patrols on trains on such dates,"" he added.

On Pune-Lonavala locals, one male constable and one female constable have been posted in ladies compartments, he adds, addressing ''local'' concerns. ""At Pune station, we always have two officers and 30 to 40 constables on duty. Two constables monitor the safe arrival and departure of every single train,"" he reveals.

Chavan, however, admitted failure to prevent pranksters from pelting stones at passing trains. ""Tracking the vandals in such cases is next to impossible and educating the local populace against such mischief is the only solution,"" he adds.

But the parting shot on railway-related concerns came from regular Pune-Mumbai commuter Ranjana Pokarna, ""Eunuchs often board trains, especially at Lonavla, and literally extort money, especially from women passengers. At such times, no policeman is to be seen. Can somebody do something about this nuisance?""

8,Two arrested for thefts on trains,"VIJAYAWADA: The Government Railway Police (GRP) arrested two members of an inter-state gang that committed robberies in trains and recovered stolen property worth Rs 1.12 lakh from them.

Addressing a press conference in Vijayawada on Friday, superintendent of GRP, Vijayawada, K Rajaratnam Naidu said Sanjay Kumar Yadav and Dhanunjay Kumar Yadav of Munger district in Bihar had committed two major offences in Palnadu Express and Repalle-Secunderabad Passenger in Guntur district.

In an another case, the GRP men arrested a suitcaselifter at Rajahmundry and recovered stolen property worth Rs 96,000 from him.

Naidu said the police who detected and arrested the culprits were rewarded suitably.

The Rotary Club of Vijayawada too honoured the GRP men for busting two inter-state gangs that committed a series of robberies in trains in this region.

9,CPM for all-party meet on evictions,"VIJAYAWADA: The CPM has demanded that the government constitute an all-party committee to discuss the eviction of hutdwellers from the three canal bunds in the city. The party also demanded that the government regularise the house-sites occupied by the hut-dwellers along the canal bunds. Addressing a press conference here on Sunday, CPM city secretary Ch Babu Rao deplored the ""unilateral actions"" of the Vijayawada Municipal Corporation and VGTM-UDA authorities in evicting the hut-dwellers from the canal bunds without taking political parties into confidence.

""The eviction of hut-dwellers will have serious socio-economic repercussions as hundreds of persons will lose their jobs. Moreover, property worth over Rs 70 crore would be destroyed in the process,"" he pointed out. Babu Rao also released details of a survey conducted by the CPM in about 6,526 families residing along the three canal bunds spread over 15 civic divisions in the city. Discussing the survey report, Babu Rao said more than 84 per cent families built houses on the canal bunds over 10 years ago while about 51 per cent had been residing there for more than 20 years. Among the 6,500 households we have surveyed, a sum of Rs 27,97,65,000 was spent on construction of houses while the total amount could be around Rs 50 crore if all the 10,000 houses were taken into account"", he said.

An estimated 50,000 people were residing in more than 10,000 houses along the canal bunds in different parts of the city, the survey revealed. The VMC had spent Rs 20 crore on infrastructure development like construction of cement roads, provision of drinking water, street lights and other amenities. ""If the houses are evicted, the Rs 70 crore property will be destroyed,"" the CPM leader observed. He said 69 per cent of the houseowners had regularly been paying property tax to the civic body while 31 per cent were still not assessed. It was mostly families belonging to the weaker sections that had occupied the canal bunds and constructed houses and eking out a livelihood by doing petty jobs in the city. If these families were relocated at Payakapuram on the outskirts of the city, 44 per cent the population would lose jobs. About 13 per cent of the people would not have access to education, he said.

More than 25 per cent of the respondents surveyed by the CPM teams expressed fear about their security if they were relocated on the city outskirts. ""Almost all the respondents we interviewed have resented the proposed eviction"", he added. The hut-dwellers want the government authorities to reconsider the decision and develop necessary infrastructure facilities here it self and take steps to check pollution in the canals, Babu Rao observed.

10,Govt may rework gas import policy on Reliance find,"NEW DELHI: Neighbour''s envy, owner''s pride. That''s how it is going to look like from Dhaka after the Reliance Industries-Niko Resources consortium''s gas find, the latest and the largest in the Krishna-Godavari basin off the Visakhapatnam coast.

This, together with the gas find reported earlier by the UK-based Cairns and hydrocarbons find by state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation in the region could turn US major Unocal''s plan to sell piped Bangladesh gas to India into a pipedream.

The Unocal plan, a subject of great debate in Bangladesh, has been hanging fire for quite some time due to political opposition in that country.

Besides, with more future finds expected as firms drill deeper into the ocean, the government is unlikely to dust the files on long-forgotten plans to import piped gas from Myanmar and the current talks of a pipeline from Iran. Both the options are fraught with great security concerns.

Is the government then evolving an ''Oil from the West and gas from the East'' policy? Could be. A hint of this came from oil minister Ram Naik.

""With the Reliance find and ONGC-Videsh''s acquisitions in Sakhalin, Vietnam and now Sudan, India has moved closer to securing its energy needs after deregulation,"" he said on Friday while announcing the actual signing of an agreement for ONGC-Videsh''s acquisition of 40 per cent stake in a Sudan oilfield for $720 million. The country at present imports 70 per cent of its crude requirement worth Rs 80,000 crore a year.

""Two historic developments have given a big boost to India''s efforts to achieve energy security: We have now secured equity oil from the West and discovered our own gas in the east,"" he said.

The Sudan oilfield has reserves of over 150 million metric tonne (over 1050 million barrels) a day with an upside potential of even more oil and gas in the block.

The field is currently producing about 12 million metric tonnes per annum (about 240,000 barrels per day), which is about the same as the production of the Mumbai High field. Thus, OVL has acquired about 3 million metric tonnes per annum of crude oil from this producing property as of 31st August this year.

OVL already has an ongoing gas project in Vietnam. The first gas is expected to flow by December. The estimated gas production would be about 7.5 million cubic metres per day, of which OVLs share would be 45 per cent. The estimated investment of OVL in the Vietnam project is about $300 million.

OVL''s Sakhalin offshore project, at an investment of about $1.7 billion, would fetch about 5 million metric tonnes per annum of oil and about 8 million cubic metres of gas per day from 2005. In addition, OVL has acquired interest in exploration blocks in Iraq, Myanmar, Libya, Iran and the US.

Domestically, the new gas finds will be good enough to feed the eastern and southern parts of the country. Though Reliance is reported to be more interested in moving the gas to the western states, others like Cairn or ONGC may yet settle to feed the east.

11,Cong to raise co-op scams in Gujarat polls,"NEW DELHI: The co-operative bank scams would be the major election issue for the Congress in Gujarat. It would also highlight loss of jobs and business, the sense of insecurity and lowering quality of life in the state during the election campaign said Kamalnath, Congress general secretary in charge of Gujarat.

Talking to reporters on Thursday he announced that the party''s election exercise would begin after Diwali, with the AICC screening committee pruning the list of candidates on November 6 and Central Election Committee finalising the list on November 10. The Gujarat pradesh election committee has sent a list of 600 names from 2,000 applicants.

At the organisational level, for each district in the state the party has drafted in 28 ministers from the adjoining Congress-ruled states Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan to coordinate party activities. These ministers are expected to collate the profiles of each district and devise strategies accordingly.

According to Kamalnath, 20 lakh people of the state have been directly affected by the cooperative bank scams and around 80 lakh indirectly and hence this issue would become the focal point of the Congress campaign.

""The BJP should explain real issues like the cooperative bank scams and developmental issues instead of diverting the people''s attention,"" said Kamalnath. The Akshardham outrage and the Gujarat riots would obviously give the party a tool to attack the government for its poor law and record.

The party might make some electoral adjustments with Ram Vilas Paswan''s Lok Jan Shakti and the Nationalist Congress Party that has influence in South Gujarat. Kamalnath claimed that the Congress would win over 105 seats in a House of 182 members. The party expects 35 out of 58 seats in Saurashtra.

The central leadership is confident of Shankersinh Vaghela''s leadership and feels that Narendra Modi by taking out a Gaurav Yatra much before the elections has burnt himself with an early intensive campaign.

Congress president Sonia Gandhi is expected to tour Gujarat, just the way she did in other states. The Congress is also banking on a platform of non governmental organisations that had given a call for unity among Opposition parties.

12,J&K govt won't be soft towards militancy: Sonia,"SRINAGAR: Congress President Sonia Gandhi on Saturday dismissed apprehensions that the new coalition government in Jammu and Kashmir will be ""soft"" towards militancy. Sonia said concerns expressed in certain quarters in this regard were ""incorrect"".

The steps being taken by the government regarding merging of the Special Operations Group (SOG) with local police and releasing of political prisoners, will by no means affect the situation in the state, Gandhi told reporters after the swearing-in ceremony of Mufti Mohammed Sayeed-led coalition government in the state.

She described Sayeed as a very experienced and responsible leader who will lead the government ""effectively"".

Asked whether the coalition will be able to provide a stable government, Gandhi said ""The coalition will provide a stable government to the people.""

On the share of Congress in the ministry, she said ""We will not press for numbers but try to provide a stable government.""

Gandhi described the ministry as small and indicated an expansion was likely in the near future.

Meanwhile, the new Chief Minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed said ""It is historic day. I pray to god that the government comes upto the expectations of the people"".

Sayeed refused to answer any further questions. He is expected to hold a press conference on Sunday afternoon.

13,SGPC executive polls to be fair: Govt,"CHANDIGARH: The Punjab government assured the Punjab and Haryana High Court on Friday that the elections to the executive committee of the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC), due to be held on November 12 at Teja Singh Samundari Hall, Amritsar, would be absolutely fair and no pressure would be exerted on anyone to vote for a particular candidate.

This assurance was given by Punjab advocate-general Harbhagwan Singh, while responding to the writ petition filed by 61 SGPC members, led by Harbhinderbir Singh, seeking directions to ensure that these elections be conducted without any interference by any government agency so that SGPC members are able to cast their vote as per their free will.

In their 34-page writ petition, these members had also sought directions to the Sikh Gurdwara Judicial Commission against passing any orders which would debar any SGPC member from participating in the elections.

The SGPC members submitted that over the last few months, an atmosphere had been created by the state government wherein members of the SGPC owing allegiance to the Shiromani Akali Dal-Badal (SAD-B) have been subjected to various kinds of pressures, intimidation and threats with a view to force them to change their allegiance and vote for candidates sponsored by the Sarb Hind Shiromani Akali Dal led by Gurcharan Singh Tohra.

In this context, these members submitted that coercive tactics adopted included raids by the state vigilance department on SGPC members, picking up their close relatives, registration of false cases against SGPC members, subjecting them to surveillance and posting security personnel at their residences, ostensibly for their security, but actually to keep a tab on their activities and to pick them up when the voting day arrives.

The petitioners said that fearing their life and security, a large number of SGPC members were forced to flee their homes. They further alleged that they feared that the state government might try to prevent SGPC members of the SAD (B) from reaching the venue of the meeting in Amritsar or resort to other tactics to prevent them from exercising their franchise freely.

However, the Punjab advocate-general submitted that he had contacted the chief secretary and the Punjab director-general of police in this regard and they had assured that the elections would be fair.

A division bench of Justices V K Bali and Virender Singh observed that in view of the statement of the Punjab advocate-general and the statement of the counsel for the petitioner made following the state governmentâ€™s assurance, the petition had become infructuous. Daraâ€™s petition dismissed: Suspended Sikh Gurdwara Judicial Commission (SGJC) member Dara Singh on Friday challenged his suspension and sought the intervention of the Punjab and Haryana High Court to have it quashed.

However, a division bench of Justices R L Anand and Surinder Singh Saron dismissed the petition as the petitioner had not attached a copy of the suspension order nor the show-cause notice which might have been served to him in this regard. The petitioner was allowed to withdraw the petition and to approach the court, if required, by annexing the copies of the suspension order and other necessary documents.

Ambala XEN imposed costs: Justice N K Sud of the Punjab and Haryana High Court on Friday imposed Rs 10,000 as costs on S P Sikka, executive engineer, public works department, Ambala, for not complying with the orders of the high court.

This was done on the contempt petition moved by Daya Kishan and two other workers of the PWD from Gurgaon who had pointed out that despite court orders staying the reduction in their salary, the respondent went ahead with the pay reduction. HC holidays: The Punjab and Haryana High Court will remain closed from November 2 to 10 on account of festival vacations. Justice Hemant Gupta would be the vacation judge during this period to hear urgent cases like habeas corpus and bail matters.

AAG transferred: Pankaj Bhardwaj, additional advocate-general, Punjab, has been posted as such to the New Delhi office of the Punjab advocate-general at Punjab Bhavan. He is expected to assume charge after the high court vacations.

Meanwhile, R K Rathore, a Delhi-based lawyer, has also been appointed as additional advocate-general, Punjab, at the New Delhi office.
