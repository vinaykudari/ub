0,Bajrang Dal activists arrested over priest attack,"hane: eighteen bajrang dal activists were arrested on tuesday in connection with the attack on a priest at st. john baptist church in thane on monday night. three of them, who the police say were the principal instigators, have been remanded to police custody for three days, while the rest have been remanded to judicial custody till august 21. they have been charged under section 120 (b) of the indian penal code, which deals with criminal conspiracy. bajrang dal activists, meanwhile, have called for a thane bandh on wednesday in protest. the priest, father oscar mendonca, had been manhandled by a mob of 50-odd persons around 8.30 p.m. the mob, belonging to the rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (rss) and the bajrang dal, were returning after attending a condolence meeting in front of thane railway station. the meet, where fiery speeches were apparently delivered, was organised to condole the reported killings of four sangh activists in tripura two years ago. according to thane police commissioner s.m. shangari, soon after the meet, the group dashed off to the st. john baptist church, where they manhandled fr mendonca, who was returning from a dentist's appointment. he ran into the church premises for cover but could not open the door of the house and was beaten up by the mob. he suffered injuries on his head and legs and was hospitalised at the thane civil hospital. the attack has been strongly condemned by all quarters. following the assault, cardinal archbishop ivan dias visited thane to take stock of the situation. he also visited fr mendonca at the hospital. speaking to newspersons, cardinal dias condemned the attack, terming it a ``barbaric act'', that too in a civilised city like mumbai. ``the offence is very serious as a person anointed by god was attacked. it is nothing but sacrilege. we hope that the government gives us justice,'' he said. speaking to this newspaper, mr shangari said the culprits would be brought to book and stern action taken against them. the commissioner said that all churches had been provided with protection, adding that he, however, did not see any negative fall-out as police action had already been initiated. meanwhile, the assault has evoked strong reaction from the catholic community, which is feeling apprehensive after the attack. many convent schools in thane, including the st. john baptist school, remained closed on tuesday. schools are likely to remain closed next monday as well. president of the youth wing of the nationalist congress party jitendra awhad met the thane police commissioner in this regard and handed over a memorandum demanding a ban on bajrang dal. he told this newspaper that bajrang dal activists were spreading communalism and ``disturbing the homogeneous structure of society.'' the indian christian congress has also condemned the assault on fr mendonca, calling it ``madness'' to assault ``an innocent priest in mumbai because some rss activists were killed two years in tripura, as alleged by them.'' bajrang dal activists have their own story to tell. office-bearer of the vishwa hindu parishad at thane, vikram bhoir told this newspaper that wednesday's bandh was to protest the fact that no action had been taken following the killings of sangh workers in tripura. ``for just two slaps, 18 of our people are arrested, while there is no action at all when four of our activists are killed,'' he said. justifying the bajrang dal's behaviour, mr bhoir further said that rss and dal activists had gone to the baptist church to submit a letter in protest to the tripura killings. ``however, we were pushed around and therefore some of our people hit back,'' he claimed.
