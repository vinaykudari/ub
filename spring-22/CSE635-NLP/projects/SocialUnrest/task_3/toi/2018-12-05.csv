7,Hashmi among 4 Delhi ministers axed,"new delhi: four of the six ministers in the sheila dikshit cabinet were shown the door on tuesday, a move which is expected to trigger a new round of dissidence in the delhi congress. after five days of hectic negotiations with the congress leadership, dikshit finally dropped transport minister pervez hashmi, power and industry minister narendra nath, social welfare minister krishna tirath and civil supplies minister yoganand shastri. a meeting with congress president sonia gandhi earlier in the day clinched the issue with dikshit and aicc general secretary in charge of delhi kamal nath agreeing on the names of haroon yusuf, ajay maken, deep chand bandhu and raj kumar chauhan for inclusion in the cabinet. finance minister mahinder singh saathi and health minister a k walia have been retained. while the portfolios of the new ministers have not been announced, the ministers are likely to be sworn in on thursday at raj nivas. dikshit has sent the names of the new ministers to the president for approval. dikshit also appointed patel nagar legislator ramakant goswami as her parliamentary secretary. goswami would replace rajouri garden mla ajay maken who will be inducted into the cabinet. after much delay, dikshit and nath had agreed to drop four ministers from the cabinet on monday night. the names of the ministers to be dropped were, however, decided on tuesday morning when the two leaders met sonia. sources said while there were differences between nath and dikshit on the choice of candidates and the number of ministers to be dropped, the two leaders finally settled for four names. all two-time mlas, the four new faces not only balance caste equations but also represent the various factions in the delhi congress. among the four new ministers, 37-year-old maken is the youngest and close associate of dikshit. haroon yusuf, who replaces hashmi as the minority face of the government, is essentially congress stalwart arjun singh's choice. in the outgoing council of ministers, singh was known to be yoganand shastri's political mentor. chauhan's induction is being seen as the victory of the sajjan kumar camp, which has influence on outer delhi. interestingly, both maken and yusuf had followed arjun singh and left the congress to join congress (tiwari). they returned when sonia took over as congress president in 1998. raj kumar chauhan, who represents the backward community and serves as a replacement for krishna tirath, belongs to the sajjan kumar faction. a legislator from mongolpuri, chuahan is also the only minister representing outer delhi. the name of deep chand bandhu, who would represent the jat community in the cabinet, was proposed by former delhi mp jagdish tytler. tytler, however, had also been pushing the name of deputy speaker in delhi assembly kiran chaudhury.

10,Tinaikar raps govt for BMC's `financial mess',"nagpur: mumbai's former municipal commissioner sadashiv tinaikar has lashed out at the state government for turning a blind eye towards the financial mismanagement in the brihanmumbai municipal corporation (bmc). the civic body has landed in a financial mess ``owing to connivance between the administration and the elected representatives'', he told tnn. incidentally, the first instalment of the tinaikar committee report was tabled in the maharashtra legislature by minister of state for urban development sunil tatakare on tuesday. the opposition stayed away from the house, boycotting the proceedings of the day over the cotton issue. although chief minister vilasrao deshmukh had earlier stated that the dissolution of the bmc house was out of question in view of the civic elections in february 2002, it is felt that the tabling the report in the legislature would provide an opportunity for the congress-led democratic front government to mount a scathing attack on the shiv sena- bjp alliance, which has controlled the corporation for the past five years. the report, besides castigating the saffron alliance, has not spared the state government and top municipal officials. maintaining that even the chief minister and the finance minister were aware of the deep morass into which the civic body was sinking, mr tinaikar challenged the government to prove that its decision to appoint half a dozen ias officers with the specific objective to improve the administration of the bmc had made any difference. furthermore, mr tinaikar had criticised successive municipal commissioners for totally abdicating their responsibility towards the corporation by forming a ``cosy relationship'' with corporators of different political parties. the 34-page report, which has disclosures of civic irresponsibilities, may come up for discussion in the legislature at a later date. however, there was no announcement of any schedule for discussion when the report was tabled in the house on tuesday. mr tinaikar also said that the statutory responsibility of the municipal commissioner to monitor financial provisions and maintain the sanctity of the accounts of the corporation could not be delegated to anyone. this is precisely what happened in the bmc from 1995. ``there is no discipline in accounts keeping. the present commissioner (karun srivastava) has defended this procedure as a tradition,'' mr tinaikar said. the report observed that ``irresponsible'' and ``careless'' corporators do not deserve to be entrusted with the civic exchequer even for a single day. ``irregularities have been taking place on a regular basis since 1994-'95 and these lapses are unpardonable. the administration and the elected representatives are responsible for this mess,'' mr tinaikar said.

12,Another quiet move by Rajnath to win farmers,"lucknow: chief minister rajnath singh has come out with yet another decision to widen the base of the bjp in rural areas. this time it is through 'petty diesel dealership', meant for open sale of diesel in areas unserved by service stations. the government has decided to issue around 6,000 new licences by the end of this month. advertisements have been issued inviting applications to be finalised by a committee headed by district magistrate for each district. two members, each nominated by the scheduled tribe and scheduled caste commission and the backward commission, will also be there on the committee. the district magistrates have been asked to expedite the process as early as possible and finish the task well before this month. this is because the government does not want to risk its postponement or deferment in the wake of the election notification, which is expected to be announced anytime now. the decision is significant as the government stands to gain in two ways. first, it has an opportunity to shower favour on bjp's workers at grassroots level and second, it can woo farmers who have to fetch diesel from far off places to run their tubewells. describing it as an 'election gimmick', former mla and senior leader of the samajwadi party, ambika chaudhary said: the decision is meant to rehabilitate the bjp workers. he said the committee set up for the selection of applicants was nothing but an eye-wash. rebutting the allegation, an official said that there was no scope for favouritism as the applicants would be selected by the draw of lottery. any educated unemployed of 21 years of age and having rs 40,000 will be eligible to apply for dealership. no licence for dealership will be issued within a five-km radius of any existing service station. a licensee can obtain a maximum stock of 4,000 litres at a time. it's storage in drums, and not underground tanks, will be mandatory. annual licence fee will be rs 1000 and it will be liable to be terminated in case the guidelines are violated. at present, nearly 11,900 such dealers are already there. while each district will have its share in the 6000 new licences to be issued, majority of them are said to have been allotted to major towns like lucknow, kanpur, agra, allahabad, jhansi, meerut, besides in areas from where the bjp has sitting mlas.

14,Thumb impressions to help govt cut graft,"hyderabad: the much-maligned thumb impression, considered a symbol of illiteracy and ignorance, is soon expected to save the state a lot of money and put an end to swindling of funds by wardens of social welfare hostels. the government is in the process of installing 200 biometric systems in as many hostels. the systems will scan thumb impressions of students to prevent wardens from claiming full attendance in the mess and pocketing the unspent money claimed towards food bills. once introduced, officials believe that the system will put an end to corruption in the social welfare hostels. so far, the wardens have been inflating the number of inmates in the hostels and have been requisitioning more provisions than needed. on more than one occasion, watchdog agencies like the anti-corruption bureau and the vigilance and enforcement wings detected major frauds by the wardens and suggested an overhaul of the entire system. the government runs 2,210 hostels under the social welfare department, while another 1,500 hostels function under the tribal welfare and backward classes welfare departments. the government spends about rs 60 crore annually for the maintenance of these hostels. the leakages are estimated to be around 20 per cent of the total budget. according to social welfare department officials, several of the wardens were found to be drawing provisions in excess of the inmates and selling them in the open market. with no foolproof mechanism to check the exact number of inmates residing in a hostel at a particular time, the government is being forced to release the provisions as indented by the wardens,'' the official said. with the introduction of the new system, a machine will scan the thumb impressions of all those taking food in the hostel — during breakfast, lunch and dinner — and an exact figure can be had at the end of each month. the provisions for the wardens will be released according to the number of inmates who actually eat in the mess,'' the officials said. the government has already directed the andhra pradesh technology services to purchase 200 biometric units, to be installed on an experimental basis.

19,"Govt bans PWG, MCC under terror law","new delhi: invoking the controversial prevention of terrorism ordinance (poto), the centre on wednesday banned the people's war group (pwg) and the maoist communist centre (mcc). read this story in... home ministry sources said these groups, along with all their formations and front organisations, have been declared ""terrorist organisations'' under the provisions of clause (a) of sub-section 2 of section 18 of poto ""with immediate effect"". wednesday's ban took the number of groups banned and declared ""terrorist"" to 25. the ordinance, promulgated on october 24, had already proscribed 23 groups, including lashkar-e-taiba, jaish-e-mohammad, harkat-ul-mujahideen, hizbul mujahideen, ulfa and simi. the action against pwg comes in the wake of its recent high-impact attacks, mostly in andhra pradesh, and sporadic violence in orissa, bihar, jharkhand and chhattisgarh. the ban of the naxalite groups comes a day after prime minister vajpayee told an all-party meeting on tuesday that there was no question of withdrawing poto, agreeing only to consider some amendments. this indicates that there is no meeting ground now on the terror law and and the stage is set for a bitter confrontation in parliament. the amendments would be discussed by the cabinet on thursday, said vajpayee at an iftaar party hosted by jammu and kashmir chief minister farooq abdullah, whose government is the first and only one yet to implement the ordinance. he, however, did not elaborate on the amendments. asked whether the government was considering convening of a joint session of parliament to adopt the bill if it failed in the rajya sabha, the prime minister declined to comment. home minister advani, meanwhile, indicated that the government would remove those provisions in poto that affect the media. ""we may not be able to allay the apprehensions of others on poto, but we will certainly do so fully with regard to mediapersons,"" said advani, while presiding over the foundation ceremony of the national press centre. the ordinance would be placed before the lok sabha on december 12 and 13, and in rajya sabha the subsequent week. the decision was taken at a meeting of the business advisory committee of the lok sabha on wednesday. in parliament, poto continued to come under fire. in the rajya sabha, during wednesday's question hour, the government clarified that though some provisions of the control of organised crimes act enacted by maharashtra and andhra pradesh are similar to the erstwhile tada, there is no overlap with the poto. ""while poto is specifically aimed at combating terrorist activities, the laws mentioned deal essentially with the control of organised crime. there are also differences in key provisions relating to bail, presumption of guilt, admissibility of confessions made by a person before a police officer, and the power of the court to take cognizance of an offence,"" minister of state for home affairs vidyasagar rao said in a written reply.

20,Student fed up with ragging commits suicide,"hyderabad: a student of mahanandi agricultural college in andhra pradesh's kurnool district committed suicide following humiliating ragging by his seniors on monday, police said. according to a delayed report reaching here on wednesday, b govardhan, a first year student, committed suicide by hanging himself at his native place at tadipatri in anantapur district. senior students at the university had a party on november 30 and some of them, in an inebriated condition, misbehaved with govardhan and forced him to do all sorts of humilating acts, police said. unable to bear the humiliation, govardhan left for his native place the next day and took the extreme step on december 3, police said. one of the three students responsible for the incident, was arrested on tuesday night, mahender reddy, dsp, nandyal, said on wednesday adding efforts were on to nab the other two. meanwhile, the three students allegedly responsible for the ragging, have been suspended from the college, according to dr s raghuvardhan reddy, registrar of acharya n g ranga agricultural university. a three-member enquiry committee has also been constituted to probe the incident in addition to the police enquiry, reddy said in a release here on wednesday.

21,Nothing political about this iftaar,"new delhi: opposition bonhomie was on full display on wednesday when a congress bandwagon led by party chief sonia gandhi rolled into the samajwadi party iftaar, hours after a congenial multi-party breakfast at left leader somnath chatterjee's residence. but the iftaar hosts, sp chief mulayam singh yadav and able aide amar singh, who organised the show at the former's residence, strove hard to send the message - ""nothing political about it"". also present at the over-crowded affair for a short while were prime minister atal bihari vajpayee, home minister l.k. advani and other nda leaders like sharad yadav and bjp spokesman v.k. malhotra. conspicuous by his absence was defence minister george fernandes who lives next door. the star invitees sonia and vajpayee gamely posed for photographs but disappointed mediapersons by making no statements. all lok morcha allies of the samajwadi party were present in full force, but the attention was clearly grabbed by the descent of congress leaders in droves in the wake of the new-found warmth. anyone who is someone in the congress was present, among them leader of opposition in the rajya sabha dr manmohan singh, spokesman jaipal reddy and former prime minister p.v. narasimha rao, senior leaders pranab mukherjee, n.d. tiwari, margaret alva, girija vyas, k.c. pant, kapil sibal and others. significantly, almost all those who attended were from the parliamentary party and not from congress' organisational structure - an attempt perhaps to bolster the claim that the new unity is not to come together for electoral purposes, but essentially for a united opposition in parliament. earlier in the day, another attempt to get the opposition together over a meal was equally well-attended when communist party of india (marxist) leader somnath chatterjee followed up his successful hilsa dinner last week with a breakfast. chatterjee's breakfast meeting, which he said he had called to improve floor coordination in parliament, was attended essentially by opposition leaders in the rajya sabha with a few important invitees from the lower house too. among those who attended were kapil sibal and jaipal reddy of the congress, amar singh of the samajwadi party, praful patel of the nationalist congress party, prem shankar gupta of the rashtriya janata dal and left party leaders. apart from coordination in house, poto, ayodhya, the disinvestment policy and other issues were discussed, chatterjee said. it was also decided to hold such sittings regularly at different venues.

26,Rajnath tries to woo farmers,"lucknow: chief minister rajnath singh has come out with yet another decision to widen the bjp base in the rural areas. this time it is through ""petty diesel dealership"" meant for open sale of diesel in the areas unserved by service stations. the government has decided to issue about 6,000 new licences by the end of this month. advertisements have been issued inviting applications to be finalised by a committee headed by the district magistrates for each area. two members, each nominated by the scheduled tribe and scheduled caste commission and the backward commission, will also be there on the committee. the district magistrates have been asked to expedite the process as early as possible as the government does not want to risk its postponement or deferment in the wake of the election notification, which is expected to be announced anytime now. the decision is significant as the government stands to gain in two ways. first, it has an opportunity to shower favour on bjp's workers at grassroots level and second, it can woo farmers who have to fetch diesel from far off places to run their tube wells. describing it as an ""election gimmick,"" former mla and senior leader of the samajwadi party, ambika chaudhary said: ""the decision is meant to rehabilitate the bjp workers."" he said the committee set up for the selection of applicants was nothing but an eye-wash. rebutting the allegation, an official said that there was no scope for favouritism as the applicants would be selected by the draw of lottery. any educated unemployed of 21 years of age and having rs 40,000 will be eligible to apply for the dealership. no licence for dealership will be issued within a five-km radius of any existing service station. a licensee can obtain a maximum stock of 4,000 litres at a time. it's storage in drums, and not underground tanks, will be mandatory. annual licence fee will be rs 1000 and it will be liable to be terminated in case the guidelines are violated. at present, nearly 11,900 such dealers are already there. while each district will have its share in the 6000 new licences to be issued, majority of them are said to have been allotted to major towns like lucknow, kanpur, agra, allahabad, jhansi, meerut, besides in areas from where the bjp has sitting mlas.
