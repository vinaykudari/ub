1,Most youngsters least bothered about polls,"lucknow: as the candidates kept their fingers crossed, the polling on monday in the nawabi city saw people of all age groups thronging the polling booths. while many were there to exercise their franchise, some others were only curious to have a look at the electronic voting machines.

however, a majority of the younger lot shunned the polling exercise. with the schools and colleges closed, the newly-turned eligible faction preferred recreational activities. speaking to the times news network, prateek singh (18) said: ""its just a holiday for me and my buddies, we have planned to go for cricket match and watch a movie in the evening."" plans to exercise vote for the first time? ""no way. who''s gonna waste a holiday for that trash?"" he quipped.

on the other hand, barring a few indifferent youths, there were some youngsters very enthusiastic to cast their votes for the first time, but could not. rohan tripathi, who was willing to give the vote but found his name absent in the voters, list, said: ""it''s so absurd, i just can''t vote because my name does not exist in the list!"" he said furiously. faria ahmed, who recently turned 18, lamented: ""i was so eager to cast vote ever since i was a kid, now when i''m eligible, my ammi doesn''t approve of my going there, because of the mob.""

not only the young generation, even some middle aged people felt that there was no need to vote. speaking to tnn, mrinalini sachdeva, a housewife, said: ""i don''t find anyone worthy of our vote. all the netas are no do-gooders, they are crooks."" sharing similar views was sumit vaish, a businessman, who felt that the promises made by politicians were meant to gain votes, which were forgotten afterwards.

as the polling continued on monday, people had mixed feelings on whether to vote or not. and the argument still continues...

3,BJP will form next govt: Goraksha Prant chief,"basti: bharatiya janata party may be shying away from the ram mandir issue but the bjp goraksha prant chief vijaysen singh still firmly holds the view that ""ram mandir is a matter of belief of crores of hindus.""

talking to times news network, here on monday, he said that the prime minister had put in all his efforts to solve the vexed issue but the muslims remained adamant which caused a deadlock.

commenting on islamic terrorism, he said, ""though all muslims are not terrorists but it is true that all terrorists are muslims"". he added if the muslims withdrew their claim on ram janmabhoomi, the world community would change its opinion against them.

speaking on various opinion polls going in favour of the samajwadi party, vijaysen said, ""the ground reality is that the bjp is going to form the government. today terrorism is the main issue and only the bjp under atal behari vajpayee has the courage to fight it. instead of fighting terrorism, the sp, bsp and the congress were siding with it, he added.

5,No victory rally for this BMC poll winner,"mumbai: anjali satardekar of the shiv sena won the elections to the bmc a week ago from tilak nagar in chembur, but she hasn''t yet organised a victory procession. ""the police informed me that firecrackers and megaphones would not be allowed during the procession and nobody would be allowed to use gulal or chant slogans,"" ms satardekar said.

8,No threat to govt over shrine issue: RSS,"nagpur: the rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (rss) gave a new twist to the ayodhya shrine issue saying that muslims were welcome to build a mosque some distance away from the disputed site. ""we are ready for a dialogue with muslim leadership and willing to offer ''kar seva'' for constructing a mosque which could be built some distance away from the proposed shrine on the banks of the sarayu river in ayodhya,"" rss spokesman m.g. vaidya said here on monday. commenting on the vishwa hindu parishad (vhp) threat to begin construction from march 15, mr vaidya said the rss had extended support to the vhp programmes up to march 12. after that, the rss will review the situation at its general council meeting beginning in bangalore on march 15. however, he ruled out any threat to the vajpayee-led nda government at the centre over the issue. the rss believes that the shrine construction at ayodhya and the stability of the nda government are not conflicting. the rss also does not apprehend any law and order problem or a communal flare-up in the event of the vhp beginning the shrine work from march 14. about 1,200 delegates of the rss will attend the three-day general council meeting in bangalore, he said. mr vaidya said the rss supported the vhp demand that the union government should return the 61-acre undisputed land that it acquired soon after the babri mosque demolition on december 6, 1992. ""the vhp and the temple trust own the land and the vhp is demanding that the undisputed land be returned so that the construction work could be started on that land. ""it would take more than two years for the construction work to reach the disputed site, by that time verdict on the dispute could be expected,"" mr vaidya said. he made it clear that the rss also favoured a judicial settlement of the issue, but the process should be expedited and the matter before the court settled in a year or so.

9,NCP establishes lead in zilla parishad polls,"pune: the nationalist congress party (ncp) had established a clear lead in both the zilla parishad and panchayat samiti elections of pune district by 9.30 pm, when counting was halfway through. they had won 20 of the 38 declared zilla parishad seats and 29 of the 74 declared panchayat samiti seats. the 13 talukas of pune district have 75 zp constituencies and 150 panchayat samiti seats. the congress party, ncp''s alliance partner in the state goverment, was relegated to the third position with a tally of four in the zp and 16 seats in the panchayat samiti. the bharatiya janata party (bjp) started its account quite late and it was the shiv sena which saved the day for the saffron alliance. the sena bagged five seats in the zp and 12 in panchayat samiti polls at the time of filing this report. the bjp showed a poor performance with only two zp seats and four panchayat samiti seats. the biggest suprise was the janata dal (s) which won four zp seats and seven panchayat samiti seats.the jd (s) owes its success to maharashtra minister of state for agriculture dada jadhavrao who ensured that his hold in purandar taluka remained intact. in fact, jadhavrao''s son and son-in-law who were standing from purandar taluka zp both won their seats. the independents who always play a crucial role in forming the ruling front got three seats in the zp and five seats in the panchayat samiti till the time of going to press. fortunately for the ncp, which was decimated badly in the municipal corporation polls held all over the state last sunday, the results were according to expectations. the party made a clean sweep in baramati taluka by winning all the zp and panchayat samiti seats.the only noticeable setbacks for the ncp were in haveli taluka where incumbent zp president jalinder kamthe''s wife, jaishree, lost the phursungi urali devachi seat to kaushalya harpale of the shiv sena. the son of senior ncp leader and former minister bapurao thite lost his zp seat in shirur. the haveli taluka, adjoining pune city limits, was also dominated by the ncp which won five out of the eight zp seats. while the ncp candidates won from dhayari khadakwasla, dehu-loni kand, urali kanchan, loni kalbhor, the shiv sena won from khed shivapur, wagholi kalawade and phursungi urali devachi. an ncp rebel, laxman keskar, won the zp seat from theur alandi. the 13 talukas of pune district had witnessed more than 65 percent polls on sunday. the counting was expected to continue till late midnight, said officials.

10,PCMC union condemns govt on octroi rules,"pune: the pimpri-chinchwad municipal corporation (pcmc) employees federation, on monday, strongly condemned the state government''s decision to withdraw implementation of the new octroi rules for the pcmc. it may be recalled that the revised octroi rates, with minimum 15 to 20 per cent hike, had come into effect just two days ago, when the stay was imposed by the government itself. enforcement of the new octroi rules was earlier objected to by the maharatta chamber of commerce, industries and agriculture (mccia). interestingly, the state government has justified its stand by re-directing the pcmc to revise the octroi rates in consultation with members of the industry. describing the government decision as a perplexing one, the pcmc employee federation warned of an agitation if the government fails to withdraw the decision within the next three days.

11,Bihar singled out for law on street vendors,"patna: bihar happens to be the only state in the country that bestows upon the police right to arrest street vendors, says a study report prepared by the national alliance of street vendors, india (nasvi). the report is based on a study of hawkers and street vendors conducted in mumbai, ahmedabad, indore, kolkata, imphal, patna, bhubaneswar and bangalore. this report was discussed during the three-day ""asian workshop on street vendors"" -- from february 11 to 13 -- at bodh gaya. the conference was attended by foreign delegates from asian countries, namely china, korea, cambodia, philippines, thailand, bangladesh, lanka, nepal, singapore and also from the countries outside asia, like south africa and kenya. the workshop was sponsored under the joint auspices of an international street vendors body, street net, and the nasvi. while talking to tnn, a participant in the workshop, suresh bhatt, said that the delegates discussed the problems faced by the street vendors and the possible means to overcome them. the meet noted that in most of the indian cities, the urban poor survive by working in informal sector and abject poverty prevailing in the rural areas drive a large number of people to the cities for earning their bread, bhatt said. it further noted that shrinking of protected jobs in the organised sector during the recent past has led even those having requisite skills to an extent to vending and hawking business, thereby enormously increasing the vending work force in the indian cities, he said. besides, due to the closure of industries, shrinking of jobs due to automation etc., a substantial increase has been seen in the hawking work force. according to the survey, mumbai has the largest number of hawkers, around 2 lakh, kolkata over 1 lakh, ahmedabad and patna around 80,000 each and indore, bangalore and bhubaneswar having around 30,000 hawkers, said bhatt. the meet felt that solution to the problem of encroachment of roadside lies not in banning or curbing hawking, but in regulating this profession, and that this is possible only when the municipal authorities, civil administration and police stop treating hawkers as anti-social elements. hawking can be regulated only if it is legalised, felt the delegates. but for manipur, no state government has given the hawkers a right to earn livelihood as a fundamental right in the light of the famous supreme court judgment regarding the issue (hawking) in the sodhan singh versus ndmc case, bhatt said. recognition of hawking as a profession would benefit the urban local bodies, as they would be able to enforce levies on the hawkers, which may run in hundreds of crores of rupees annually, felt the delegates. this would provide additional revenue for cash-strapped urban local bodies and for the hawkers, recognition of their profession would mean that they too have a right to their profession. in turn, it would also loosen the stranglehold of the corrupt urban local bodies officials and employees, policemen and gangsters over them, the delegates stressed, bhatt added.

12,HC for coordinated procurement policy,"patna: the patna high court has asked the centre and the state government to procure food grain from the districts as the farmers were being forced to go for distress sale of their produce. chief justice ravi s dhavan observed that the objectives of the fci included procurement of food grain but he reminded the state government that it cannot escape responsibility. the petitioner''s counsel appeared before the division bench of the chief justice and justice sudhir kumar katriar to put the union and bihar governments in the dock again. the court directed the two governments to come out with a coordinated procurement policy. g s kang, state food and civil supplies secretary, was also present in the court room. the centre, during the last hearing, had filed an affidavit saying that it does not purchase food grain directly from farmers in any state and had blamed the state government''s ""omissions and commissions"". however, the petitioner''s counsel mrigank mauli submitted information collected from the centre''s website which categorically said that the fci and state government agencies, in consultation with state governments concerned, open a large number of purchase centres throughout the state to facilitate purchase of food grain. also, the farmers should not be required to cover more than 10 km to sell their produce. it also said that bihar ranked 5th in rice production and 6th in wheat production in the country. it produces 6.97 per cent of the entire food grain output of the whole nation. interestingly, it is ahead of states like andhra pradesh, haryana, maharashtra, rajasthan, karnataka and tamil nadu. however, the procurement of food grain in bihar by the fci is negligible and at the bottom end of the table. an example of the stepmotherly treatment meted out to bihar is best illustrated by comparing the production and procurement in other states with those in bihar. haryana produced 2.59 million tonnes and the procurement was a healthy 0.986 million tonnes. bihar had the production at 7.74 million tonnes, but the procurement was negligible enough to be bracketed in the ""others"" category.

14,"Nehru still sells, not his party","allahabad: for half a century, anand bhawan was the spiritual hub of india''s anti-colonialism and the organisational anchor of the congress party. today, it seems like just another tourist landmark: the home of allahabad''s greatest son, jawaharlal nehru. as the rhetoric of caste and religion â€” and free market â€” overtakes nehru''s party and legacy in the gangetic plains, the memories of the man have all but faded. in civil lines, bhola rainwal, a young dalit driver, recalls going to the anand bhawan as a child but admits he ""hardly remembers anything from the visit"". more sheepishly, he acknowledges that he knows ""very little"" about the ""great man"" who did so much ""for us"". but rainwal''s curious mix of ignorance and reverence hides more than reveals. because anand bhawan is no ordinary tourist attraction. on a balmy tuesday morning, it resembles a site of pilgrimage more than a political museum. the mood is less of mundane curiosity and more of rapturous darshan. the men and women who solemnly file into the main building belong to every corner of uttar pradesh: from gorakhpur to mathura, from azamgarh to moradabad. but there is almost no one from allahabad city and hardly any from the middle classes whose darling nehru once was. one of the guards who ushers in the ticket-holders says that the average daily turnout at the bhawan is in the region of 1,000-1,500 people. apart from busloads of foreigners on conducted tours, a majority of those who arrive are the poor from the hinterland. ""they first go to triveni and then come here,"" he explains. if there is a patronising undertone in the comment, then it is difficult to detect and, at any rate, unjustified. unlike the ghats, entry to anand bhawan costs rs 5 per adult â€” a choice, perhaps, not easily made for some of those who turn up. so what brings them to anand bhawan? not the memory of nehru the political and economic visionary, but nehru the mahapurush: the man who put self before others, who happily embraced the harsh conditions of the colonial prison over a life of luxuries and riches and, finally, who was the chosen favourite of the real mahatma. but how do they reconcile the canonisation of nehru with their rejection of his party? by an process of differentiation. first between nehru and his party and then between past and present. ""nehru was not just a pradhan mantri. he was a yug purush (an epochal figure),"" says a young student from gorakhpur. ""this congress is not nehru''s congress,"" nods his older companion in agreement.

15,Ayodhya issue will fade once polls are over: Dutt,"vadodara: the ayodhya issue will die out once the assembly polls in the country come to an end. the people who raked up the controversy will themselves leave it as it was raised for electoral purposes only. veteran movie star and congress mp sunil dutt said this while speaking to newsmen here on monday. dutt was in the city to campaign for congress candidate for the sayjigunj assembly by-polls, dalsukh prajapati. according to dutt, those involved in the controversy should wait for the supreme court verdict on the issue. ""however, one is disappointed to see that people have been raking up the issue despite the fact that a suit regarding it is pending in the apex court,"" dutt said. dutt called on political parties to leave the temple issue aside and start working for the development of the country. ""will problems like poverty, unemployment and education be solved by raking up controversies like the present one,"" he said.

16,Low turnout a show of protest,"lucknow: with the murder of ayush agarwal (7) and his sister mansi (4) on february 14 by the rickshaw- puller who used to take them to school and consequent protest and arson still fresh in the minds of the local residents, the low turnout in the polling on monday in the congested daliganj area of the state capital came as another silent protest by the people of the area. none was ready to forgive the police for adopting a lackladisical attitude. for they still believe that timely police action would have saved the lives of the two children. the suspension of four policemen on charges of dereliction of duty has not helped ease their anger. ""the suspensions cannot bring the two children back to life,"" rajendra, a neighbour of the agarwals, told times news network. fareed, a resident of the ekka stand in the daliganj area, said the local people would not forget the incident so easily. ""the children were murdered for no rhyme and reason,"" he said. even the police admitted that the motive behind the killing had not established. the accused, who has been arrested, had claimed that the children were kidnapped for ransom and killed around midnight on february 14 when they tried to raise an alarm. however, the captors did not even make any attempt to call the agarwals for ransom. the agarwals had alleged that had the police not taken the alibi of being busy with rehersals for the prime minister''s programme and searched for the missing ayush and mansi, the two could have been saved. they were the only children of gopal agarwal and their cold blooded murder has once again exposed the alarcity with which the police act in the pm''s constituency. in fact, had it not been for their parents, even the bodies of the two children would not have been found. ayush and mansi left for their town hall public school on february 14 but did not reach. later, it was discovered that the rickshaw-puller who took them from home was missing. while the police chose to sit back, the agarwals managed to locate the residential address of the missing rickshaw-puller at raitha village under the bakshi ka talab police station. the police, in the first visit to raitha village, did not raid the house of the suspect. when they finally did during the second visit around midnight, the children were found dead. this led to tension in the daliganj area and the people indulged in arson the next morning. two days later, on monday, the gloom cast by the death of ayush and mansi could be felt in daliganj which a local trader vinod summed up by saying: ""i shudder to think that instead of ayush and mansi, it could have had been my children.""

18,"Schools flouting law, say stationery sellers","mangalore: the dakshina kannada and udupi district book and stationery sellers association here said the state government was losing revenue to the tune of rs 50 crore annually due to schools selling books forcibly to students. the president of the association, mohandas shenoy told reporters here that despite the education act banning schools from indulging in commercial activities, the schools were pressuring students to buy books and stationery items from them, at the beginning of the academic year. shenoy said as these schools were not bound by sales tax and other regulations, the state was losing heavily and also making the registered book sellers lose heavily. the association has already submitted a memorandum to the government to prevent schools from indulging in commercial activities. he said, despite education minister vishwanath passing the order, it did not have much impact. according to the karnataka education act of 1983, the student has the right to purchase books and stationery items from anywhere and the schools have no say in this matter. shenoy was elected as the president of the association with krishnaraja saralaya of udupi and rajaram shenoy of karkala as its vice-presidents. other members are: sukumar kamath (secretary), k. ashok prabhu of sullia and gabriel coelho, (joint secretaries) and mohandas bhandary (treasurer).

""the taking-over of dpc by ntpc will seriously burden the resources of ntpc and adversely affect the credit rating of ntpc which in turn will jeopardise the capacity addition programme of ntpc,"" the state-owned power utility said. ntpc said the proposal was properly considered taking into account its capacity addition programme, debt servicing requirements and the issues involved in dpc.
