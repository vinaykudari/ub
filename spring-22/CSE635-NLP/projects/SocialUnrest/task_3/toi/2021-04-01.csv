1,Maharashtra will decide who rules Delhi: Pawar,"MUMBAI: Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar said that Maharashtra would decide the next government in Delhi as the Congress-NCP candidates would sweep the Lok Sabha elections in the state.

Pawar was addressing a rally at Ghatkopar in northeast Mumbai on Wednesday.

â€œThere is a mood to change the government which failed to deliver the goods,â€™â€™ he said. He praised Congress president Sonia Gandhi for taking an initiative to bring like-minded secular parties on common platform to fight BJP-led coalition in the Lok Sabha elections.

Earlier, taking the Sena-BJP combine head-on at another rally at Thane, the rank and file of the NCP launched scathing attacks on the saffron combine and the NDA government for their alleged duplicity and misrule, and singled out Sena chief Bal Thackeray for sharp criticism. The attack was led by NCP president Sharad Pawar.

Angered by the recent remark of Thackeray that he was â€œa blot on the Maratha communityâ€™â€™, Pawar accused the former of having a sham committment to Chhatrapati Shivajiâ€™s ideals.

â€œThackeray was present when PrimeMinister Vajpayee publicly opposed the state governmentâ€™s ban on the controversial book on Shivaji by American author James Laine in a rally at Mumbai.Why did he keep mum at that time?â€™â€™ Pawar thundered.

The Sena did nothing against Laine despite being in power in Delhi, but it was the state government which acted in the matter. He further accused the Sena of commercialising Shivaji.

Pawar, further said that the five years of BJP rule witnessed more farmers committing suicide, national assets being sold and the centre pandering to the dictates of multinational companies than working for the welfare of Indian companies.

â€œNhava-Sheva port was built by the Centre at a cost of Rs 800 crores. Now it is being sold to a Danish company.Also thousands of factories in the Thane-Belapur belt and Pimpri-Chinchwad area were shut because of the economic policies of the BJP,â€™â€™ he said.

Congressâ€™ star candidate Govinda gave a new slogan to the party workers, when he announced in hi inimitable style, â€œSoniaji is not a â€˜Bahuâ€™ but she is a â€˜Betiâ€™ of the country as she has decided to fight for common people.â€™â€™

2,They wear political loyalty on their sleeves,"GAYA: At social gatherings and other places in Gaya, the question innocuously asked from local political leaders is â€œAj kal ap kis party mein hain (to which political party do you belong to these days)â€�.

The response ranges between embarrassment and brawl.

But political activist Bhagwan Bhaskar does not see anything wrong in it as, according to him, the local politicians have even put frogs to shame through effortless response to the call of an ever-pricking conscience.

The list of Gaya-based political â€œaya ram gaya ramâ€� virtually reads the whoâ€™s who of Gaya politics. To begin with, the outgoing MP Ramji Manjhi, was till the other day singing the development tune and even caused major embarrassment to the energy minister Shakeel Ahmed Khan during the inauguration of the DD news transmitter in Gaya a few weeks back. On being denied the lotus symbol, Manjhi approached Khan for the lantern symbol.

Manjhi is not alone, when it comes to jumping sides. Two-time Gaya MLA and self-proclaimed Indira-loyalist Jai Kumar Palit has been to three political parties.

He quit Congress to contest the Gaya Town assembly seat on the lantern symbol and could not end up even as the runner-up.

On this election eve, Palit joined the BJP and yet the lotus symbol eluded him for the Koderma seat.

Like Palit, former MP Rajesh Kumar, too, has been in different parties at different points of time. Starting his political career in the now extinct Janata Party, Kumar was in the Congress and the JD(U) before homecoming in the RJD. Dhirendra Agrawal, the former Chatra MP, too, has come to the RJD via the Congress and the BJP.

Rajesh Manjhi, the RJD hopeful for the Gaya seat, contested assembly election from Bodh Gaya as the BJP candidate. If the speculation is to be believed, Balbir Chand, the BJP candidate from Gaya, also courted RJD supremo Laloo Prasad Yadav and LJP chief Ram Bilas Paswan before making a belated knock at BJPâ€™s doors.

When it comes to switching parties, the law, energy and minority welfare minister Shakil Ahmed Khan appears to be the proverbial country cousin of his more conscientious political peers as he (Khan), has only one jump to his credit.

Khan was in the CPI before joining the Laloo bandwagon. And he has good reasons to envy the likes of Jai Kumar Palit and Rajesh Kumar. But then, every saint has a past and every sinner has a future, goes the saying.

7,Jilted youth commits suicide,"CHANDIGARH: Dumped by his girlfriend, a 20-year-old youth Jai Prakash, allegedly committed suicide by hanging himself from a ceiling fan on Wednesday.

Jai Parkash was a resident of Sector 52. The youth committed suicide in a room in the backyard of the house while his father was sleeping in his room and his brothers - Asho and Pareep -were in their room on the first floor of the house.

He was found hanging by his father on Wednesday morning. It is learnt that the boy was upset for the past few days, and had a long chat with his father before going to bed on Tuesday night.

His father Sarju Parshad, a labourer, tried to convince him not to take things to heart but failed. His mother had expired few years ago.

Police have recovered a suicide note from a register kept in the room where Jai Parkash committed suicide, which says that a girl spoiled his life and no one else is responsible for his death.

This is the second incident of a boy ending his life because of a girl in past four days.

On Sunday, 25-year-old Kashmiri Lal had allegedly committed suicide by consuming sleeping pills.

Kashmiri had also mentioned a girl in the suicide note. His father Phoney Ram, an employee of CSIO, too, ended his life as he could not bear his son''s death.

8,Religion and elections don't mix: SC,"NEW DELHI: In an oblique warning to those who might mix religion with electioneering in search of votes, the SC on Wednesday held that no person, even the most popular leader, should be allowed to give speeches to destroy the country''s secular fabric.

""Oneupmanship in the name of religion, whichever it be or at whomsoever''s instance it be, would render constitutional designs countermanded and chaos, claiming its heavy toll on society and humanity as a whole may be the inevitable evil consequence,"" a Bench of Justices Doraisway Raju and Arijit Pasayat said.

It upheld a Karnataka government ban on VHP leader Praveen Bhai Togadia from visiting certain ""communally sensitive"" areas in the state in February 2003 on the ground that his utterances would incite communal feelings affecting the communal harmony.

On Togadia''s petition, the Karnataka HC quashed the ban order resulting in the state government moving the apex court.

Allowing the state government''s appeal, the Bench said: ""No person, however big he may assume or claim to be, should be allowed irrespective of the position he may assume or claim to hold in public life to either act in a manner or make speeches which would destroy secularism recognised by the Constitution"".

The Bench said secularism was not to be confused with communal or religious concepts.

""It means that the state should have no religion of its own.""
