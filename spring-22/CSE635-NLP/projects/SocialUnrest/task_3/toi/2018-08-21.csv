0,'Govts have hindered tribal developments',"shimla: bjp national vice-president and mp from jharkhand, kariya munda, said an effective mechanism was needed for monitoring funds sent for tribal development schemes, as they were being squandered in most of the states. in an informal chat with newsmen here on sunday, the tribal leader who was here in connection with a function organised by the himgiri kalyan ashram accused the state governments for being responsible for the hurdles in the way of development of the tribal communities. he said that over the past decades crores of rupees had been spent on development of tribal areas and schemes for the uplift of tribals, but the ground realities had hardly improved. ''the main reason for this is that the funds do not percolate down to the tribal population and at times are also squandered elsewhere, he added. pleading the case of tribals, munda said no effective measures were undertaken to uplift the tribals immediately after independence, and over the years their position only deteriorated. things had reached a stage when there is divided opinion over whether the tribals should be kept confined to their traditional paradigms, or brought within the national mainstream, he added. he, however, hastened to add that there was no dearth of schemes for the upliftment and betterment of tribals of the country, the only problem was their effective implementation.

3,Krishna govt is ignoring drought: Tanga,"hubli: the ""it-savvy"" government led by chief minister s.m. krishna has totally failed to counter the threat posed by drought in many districts of the state and the threat of famine is imminent if these these rainless days continue, bjp state vice-president m.r. tanga said in hubli on monday. lashing out at the inefficiency of the state government, tanga said the rainy season is late by almost three months in north karnataka, and krishna had only toured bijapur and belgaum districts. it was almost two months since the cm had gone on record announcing 143 talukas as totally drought-hit and nothing in terms of compensatory intervention had been done by the government, he charged. tanga wondered why the government was not serious in tackling drought and demanded that an all-party committee be set up immediately to tour the state and complete relief projects. he said the government had not made a systematic and scientific study of the drought situation and said its seriousness was not being understood. tanga denied charges that the grains being supplied were of inferior quality and said that in case such a consignment had arrived, it was the duty of the state government to send it back and demand quality consignment. he said it was unfortunate that the ""state government was going in for a confrontationist stance with the nda government at the centre"". he pooh-poohed the allegation by the congress that the centre was neglecting the congress in karnataka in favour of nda partner andhra pradesh. tanga said the centre had sanctioned rs 302 crore for rural development, rs 140 crore for irrigation, rs 42 crore for drinking water facilities for bellary, mysore and mangalore districts. apart from that, rs 83 crore worth of foodgrain was being delivered with clear instructions that all funds should be mobilised for drought relief. he said the state government should immediately utilise these funds for drought relief and stop the senseless migration of landless agricultural labourers to neighbouring states. to the charge of the state government that it had sanctioned fodder, tanga said the centre had only promised free transportation of fodder and not free fodder. he said the cm was not interested in taking into account the woes of citizens and was only laying foundation stones, attending festivals, inaugurals, exhibitions, seminars and other glamorous events. tanga said the state government was losing it's grip over the bureaucracy and official machinery was not being fully utilised. he cited the example of the raichur deputy commissioner not attending drought review meetings because he had ""no time"". he said this attitude of the bureaucracy would put the common man and the farming community in dire straits. he said that each taluka headquarters should start drought relief offices to bail out citizens being affected by drought and famine. he said the office should list the amount received by way of drought relief from the state and centre, projects taken up, names of officials at work and status of the projects at a given time.

4,Fuzzy laws allow quacks to prosper,"panchkula: confusion regarding the district health authorities' power to initiate action against quacks and bogus registered medical practitioners (rmps) operating in the district has facilitated their growth. crippled by lack of clear cut instructions, the health authorities have neither cracked down on bogus doctors in the past nor do they have any plan of doing so in the future. health authorities in the district admit that there are a large number of quacks practising medicine illegally without any qualification and that there had been no crackdown on them. this has only encouraged more people to take to quackery as a full time profession. there are over 300 rmps practising in panchkula and same number of unqualified quacks practising illegally, say sources in the health department. although the presence of bogus rmps in the urban area is almost negligible, but they dominate the rural and slum areas of the district. interestingly these registered medical practitioners have a certificate obtained by them from bihar and uttar pradesh along with their registration numbers from that state. civil surgeon panchkula dr h c nagpal highlighted that lack of any clear cut policies in dealing with those having bogus degrees or practising without qualification had resulted in little action against these doctors. ''how genuine the degree of the medical practitioner is, whether that degree is valid in the state of haryana, whether someone registered in one state can practice in another, whether someone having a degree in ayurveda can practice allopathy are some points which are not very clear and neither do we have any clear cut policies on them,"" said nagpal. a visit to some of these ''doctors"" is an eye opener of sorts as some of these ''medical shops"" are in a pathetic condition. a small dingy dilapidated room with space to just about manage a table and a stool and bare minimum medical equipment serves as a ""clinic"" for a ""doctor"" doing roaring business in rajiv colony. the colony alone has over ten such shops frequently visited by the residents for ailments.the rush of patients is more so in the monsoons owing to break out of diarrhoea and monsoon related problems. one such doctor claiming to have a degree in ayurveda was brazenly giving out allopathy medicines including antibiotics andpainkillers. poverty and illiteracy in slums are the main reason attributed to the growth of these quacks and rmps. doctors at general hospital sector 6 said that a number of cases were reported to the hospital where treatment had earlier been given by a quack and had resulted in complications. dr h c nagpal admitted the fact that these rmps were yet to come under direct control of the district health authorities. the only power the health authorities had was to inspect the drugs or the material they used. for this purpose one senior drug inspector accompanied by a medical officer was already on the job,he added.

5,Who will rule tomorrow's techology landscape?,"bangalore: the sun's j2ee versus microsoft's .net battle will be the action thriller of the decade for the geeks to savour. it's all about the two choices that businesses have for building xml-based web services: the java 2 platform - enterprise edition (j2ee), created by sun microsystems and other industry players, and microsoft's .net, developed by microsoft corporation. although both j2ee and .net cover a vast expanse of technologies and standards, right now the focus is on building web services. over the past few years, extensible mark up language (xml) has come up enabling heterogeneous computing environments to share information and business processes over the web. and, now it's all about the brave new world of web services. says sanjay parthasarthy, vp, microsoft,""the development of these new web services is considered as the next generation of computing. just imagine, a future where information resides in a central repository and can be accessed by a range of computing platforms. for instance, if my wife sends me an email, i should be able to get it through the phone. the telephone database should be connected to my computer in an intelligent way so that the computer knows i am not using it but knows i am on a phone and i get the email, read out to me. that is the future we are looking at."" there are lofty promises and harsh realities pertaining to both platforms. j2ee is a rather brilliant move on sun's part, and obviously is not an altruistic initiative. all vendors who participate in j2ee are after financial gains, as well as an effective weapon against microsoft. j2ee enables these vendors to collaborate together and stand ground. characteristically, for microsoft.net, the initiative is a monopolistic one. microsoft has been claiming that .net is about open and interoperable web services, when in reality it is already making their web services closed and proprietary. however, it is tying up with hundreds of services companies across the world, under the name of hailstorm. interestingly, both platforms are useful and lead you to the same destination. but the deciding factor will be the existing developer skill-sets, systems, vendor relationships and customers. those almost always drive the decision, not the minor features. web services are in reality simply xml-based interfaces to business applications and it is on this dynamically slippery xml ground that the battle for developers skills is being fought. says reginald hutcherson, sun evangelist, ""basically, j2ee was designed to simplify complex problems with the development, deployment, and management of multi-tier enterprise solutions. it has become more of a standard, as a result of a large industry initiative led by sun microsystems."" on the other hand, .net is a product strategy, where a whole new world of web services come by. and, bill gates has put his `a' team on this job to create the marketing hype. says rafique, a programmer who works on .net framework, ""this is language independent and works between different languages. a single .net component can be written, for example, partially in vb.net, (the .net version of visual basic) and c#, microsoft's new object-oriented programming language. that makes things easy for us."" incidentally, microsoft's single-vendor integration, the ease-of-use, and the super-cool wizards are awesome to have when building web services. but move over to microsoft's passport services (shared context) and you open a pandora's box of opinions. ""to understand this shared context, think about how many usernames, passwords, credit card information, and so-on that you need to remember and re-type in every time you visit a web site. with shared context if you type this information once, then that information is accessible to all web services that you choose to give access,"" added siddharth dutta, another programmer who works on .net. but for j2ee, shared context is a decentralized, distributed suite of shared context services that live on the internet. each user might have a list of one or more of their preferred shared context services, with each repository storing select information about that user. ""the noticeable difference is that the sun j2ee approach will spawn a marketplace of shared context repositories on the internet, whereas the microsoft.net solution is a single shared context repository approach with a `big brother' effect, says atul chitnis, ceo, excore. and, given that almost no web services use shared context yet, it is too early to tell which approach is the best, says sun's hutcherson.

17,Hold early local bodies' polls or face President's rule: HC,"patna: irked at non-committal attitude of the state government on holding of municipal elections in bihar, a division bench of the patna high court on monday observed that it may recommend president's rule in the state under article 356 of the constitution if the state government did not satisfy it about the proper functioning of the constitutional machinery. the court added that the recommendation could be made for a limited purpose of holding early municipal elections in the state. the court, as a matter of fact, made its terse observation having heard the arguments put forward by the chief secretary earlier and by the urban development department secretary on monday in their separate affidavits. on monday, the bench comprising chief justice r s dhavan and justice s k singh asked the standing counsel of the state government, r k dutta, to explain if there was any constitutional breakdown in the state that was having effect on holding early municipal elections. the court had taken a serious view of the affidavits sworn in by the chief secretary earlier, and the urban development secretary on monday, in which they were not clear about holding early municipal elections. the court's concern was that an early, free and fair municipal elections should be held in the state. on august 13, the division bench had observed that ""bihar was losing the federal grant meant for the grassroots planning"" due to failure of the state government in holding timely local bodies' polls. the bench had observed that holding of municipal polls ought to be treated as ""virtually a war-time emergency"" measure. ""the people of bihar are entitled to know when municipal elections are going to be held. the schedule of the time table of the election must be placed before the court crystal clear,"" the court had further observed. but the attitude of the state government, as reflected before the court, made the judges doubt its seriousness in holding the early municipal elections. earlier, the chief secretary had on an affidavit stated that all preparatory work with regard to holding the municipal elections would be completed by the end of september this year. but the chief secretary had also added that he was ""not in a position to give a schedule of the municipal elections."" then on monday, the urban secretary said on an affidavit before the division bench that the cabinet secretariat and coordination department had decided to defer the proposals for amending the patna municipal (preparation of electoral roll and conduct of election) rules, 1953, and bihar municipal election rules, 1953. he added that the draft rules were being prepared afresh and it would be sent to the cabinet secretartiat shortly. at this, the lawyer and secretary of council for protection of public rights and welfare, m p gupta, said that the date for preparatory work for holding early municipal elections had already lapsed. he added that the statements of the chief secretary and the urban secretary were misleading. he said that the state legislature had already amended the two municipal rules, but ""the bureaucracy had adopted a dilly-dallying tactics.""

18,"IMA, minister differ on family welfare measures","patna: the seminar on ""population explosion"" organised by the bihar chapter of indian medical association(ima) in patna on sunday brought into sharp focus the differences of opinion between the medical body on one hand, and family welfare minister dr shakeel ahmad on the other, over the issue of implementation of population control measures. the seminar was inaugurated by the rjd national president laloo prasad yadav. while the state ima president dr ajay kumar said that the indira gandhi government fell in 1977 due to the coercive measures adopted to check population, ahmad said that there was nothing wrong with the implementation of the programme during the congress rule at the centre. kumar said that the population measures lost both direction and grassroot touch in the late 60s which led to excesses in the name of implementation of family planning programme during the emergency period. ahmad, however, strongly defended the execution of family welfare programmes during the indira regime. although he admitted that incidents of coercive measures adopted to meet the family planning target in some parts of the country could not be condoned, still it remained a fact that the programme lost its thrust after 1977 as the successive government failed to take up the programme in right earnest due to political considerations. ahmad said that although the ima president had criticised the implementation of the family welfare programme, the medical body failed to suggest an alternative method to execute it. expressing his serious concern over the population growth rate, he said that the 2001 census figure indicated that population growth rate had exceeded national average in the state. a senior ima functionary said that it had advised all its members to visit at least five village each to create an awareness regarding the need of having small families. the ima would be issuing letters to all its members in this regard within 10 days, he said. he also felt that the state government should establish a separate ministry to implement family welfare programme in bihar. inaugurating the programme, laloo said that the government would soon hand over the responsibility of implementing the programme to the panchayats. asking the doctors to remain present at their place of postings to provide medicare facilities to the people in rural areas, laloo said that population control had emerged as the biggest problem before the state. he, however, advised the doctors to perform tubectomy and vasectomy operations with caution. the rjd chief said that the presence of doctors at their places of posting would go a long way in checking the population. the rjd chief, however, surprised the doctors when he said that doctors too were somehow responsible for the growth in the population rate as they increased the life expectancy of people through treatment. ""you are trying to make people immortal(amar)"" he told doctors. he also felt that the population control was a natural process. kumar also lamented the poor percentage of males opting for vasectomy. males opting for tubectomy operations constituted only two per cent of the population opting for contraceptive measures.

26,Sporadic violence during NDA-sponsored `Bihar bandh',"patna: barring sporadic incidents of violence and disruption in the movement of trains at various places, the national democratic alliance (nda)-sponsored `bihar bandh' passed off peacefully on tuesday. the bandh call was given to protest against the ""all-round failure"" of the rabri devi government. in patna, the police resorted to two rounds of firing in the air to disperse a group of bandh supporters armed with lathis and iron rods trying to stop the movement of vehicles near the hardinge park. no one was injured in the police firing. according to ig (operation) neelmani, in all, 3,280 bandh supporters, including three mps -- raghunath jha, ramjivan singh and sanjay paswan -- and over two dozen legislators of the parties constituting the nda, were picked up by the police from different parts of the state. among the arrested legislators were bjp state unit president nand kishore yadav, leader of the opposition in the state assembly sushil kumar modi and samata leader p k sinha. in patna alone, 645 agitators were arrested. earlier, the state government had sounded red alert in bihar with special emphasis on the railways as it apprehended large-scale violence by bandh supporters. dgp r r prasad said no major incident of violence was reported from any part of the state during the bandh. however, bandh supporters at some places, including ara, buxar, turki (muzaffarpur), madhubani town, supaul, pipra and chakia (both in east champaran), squatted on the railway tracks and disrupted the movement of trains for a few hours. a major disruption in the railway traffic was reported from the shiho station (in muzaffarpur) where the train movement could be normalised at 2 pm after the police intervention. samata party mla bhagwan singh was arrested along with other bandh supporters at ara for trying to obstruct the railway and road traffic. according to a report from warsaliganj, 15 bandh supporters received injuries when the police resorted to lathicharge on them at warsaliganj (nawada district). the bandh hit the normal life as the vehicular traffic was paralysed all over the state. office-goers and commuters had to face a lot of problem as only a small number of tempos and rickshaws plied on the roads of patna. shopkeepers on the main thoroughfares kept their shutters down. in view the bandh call, many schools were closed for the day in patna. modi said the people of the state have lost faith in the rabri government. claiming the bandh to be a big success, he said the people have expressed their solidarity with the bandh supporters agitating against the massacre of dalits at mataurha and the police firing on flood victims at aurai. in darbhanga district, the response to the bandh was ""unprecedented"", something never seen in the last 20 years, he added. other nda leaders said the ""overwhelming response"" to their bandh call has proved beyond doubt that the people of the state are fed up with the ""corrupt, ineffective and incompetent laloo-rabri regime"". the bjp state unit president charged the police with resorting to lathicharge on the bandh supporters ""demonstrating peacefully"" at buxar. samata party state office secretary sanjay kumar sinha said about 20 party workers sustained injuries in the police lathicharge at dumraon. incidentally, this was the second joint `bihar bandh' call given by the nda in protest against the ""deteriorating"" law and order situation, ""discrimination"" in the distribution of flood relief and other ""failures"" of the state government. before this, the nda had jointly called for a `bihar bandh' in 1999 to protest against the senari massacre after which president's rule was imposed in bihar for a brief period.

27,Ground work for municipal polls will be over by Sept 30,"patna: advocate general (ag) shashi anugrah narain on tuesday submitted before the patna high court that preparatory work, including amendments in the municipal rules, would be over by september 30. arguing before a division bench, comprising chief justice r s dhavan and justice s k singh, the ag said that the state government would now be in a position to request the election commission to hold municipal polls in bihar. the court adjourned the case to september 20 and observed that it was not satisfied with the affidavits filed by the chief secretary and the urban development secretary in which they could not clarify the government's stand to hold early municipal polls. panchayati raj: the patna high court on tuesday asked the state counsel to give government's reply as to whether all the power provided in the constitution had been devolved to the panchayati raj institutions to make the latter act as the local self-government. a division bench, comprising chief justice r s dhavan and justice s k singh, expressed concern at the delay in devolution of power to the three-tier panchayati raj institutions. stressing on the need of early transfer of power, authority and responsibility to the panchayati raj institutions, lawyer m p gupta submitted that the state government had failed to transfer the power as envisaged in article 243-g and 11th schedule of the constitution. he added that the 11th schedule contains a list of 29 subjects in which power with responsibility has to be transferred to the panchayati raj institutions to enable them function as the local self-government. standing counsel alamdar hussain said that modalities were being worked out to transfer the power to panchayati raj institutions. the power might be devolved to the panchayats and other panchayati raj institutions by middle of september, he added. ajanta circus: a single bench of the patna high court, presided by justice radhamohan prasad, held on tuesday that the state government and the union government were not justified in ""requiring the ajanta circus to take proper health care of the animals by giving them healthy diet in their own enclosures when the latter was prohibited from exhibiting the animals in its shows"". allowing partly the writ petition of ajanta circus, the bench held that once the animals became a state property it was the duty of the respondents to maintain and take the animals to the rescue centres. the plea of the ajanta circus was that the respondent's directive asking the circus management to take the animals, including tiger, lions and some other animals, to the rescue centres was unjustified. on this, the court held that ""once the animals of the circus become the state property it is the duty of the respondents to maintain and take them to rescue centres"". directive to bpsc: a single bench of the patna high court presided by justice s n jha on tuesday directed the bihar public service commission (bpsc) to initiate criminal proceedings against a so-called aspirant for the bihar judicial service competitive examinations, who, in his writ petition, gave false statement that he was in the merit list. petitioner subhash chandra pandey had claimed that he stood 58th in the merit list of 68 candidates. the bpsc had to make recommendations from this list for appointments to the bihar judicial service. the court, on the basis of the records submitted by bpsc counsel ashok kumar sinha, found that the original applicant in the bpsc record was subhash chandra pandey, son of s p pandey. the name of petitioner's father was balram pandey. the petitioner's educational certificates and registration as lawyer, too, did not tally with those mentioned in the bpsc record about the original applicant and the examinee was named as subhash chandra pandey, the court maintained. the bpsc plea was that the original examinee did not appear with the certificates.

28,Laloo's back in national politics?,"new delhi: with a three-hour dharna against the vajpayee government near parliament house on tuesday, rjd leader laloo prasad yadav sought to make a comeback to national politics after a long gap. himself beset with a spate of corruption charges and the ongoing cbi probe in the fodder scam, the irrepressible rjd leader, however, seemed all set for a fresh innings in opposition politics at the national level. among those with him on dharna were former pm chandra shekhar, congress general secretary mahavir prasad and cpm leader h k s surjeet apart from the mps of his party. organised by the rjd, the dharna demanded the ouster of the vajpayee government, but more specifically called for finance minister yashwant sinha's resignation owning responsibility for the uti scam. ``the dacoits in the government will not go on their own, we have to chuck them out,"" laloo said in a typical bluster. he said from now on, he would make special efforts to consolidate the opposition unity. there were clear indications that the rjd leader had sensed an opportunity to come back to national politics. going by the response from the other opposition parties, if not of the crowd, laloo seemed to have recovered some of the lost ground. however, that it would not be a smooth ride was apparent from what samata party member prabhunath singh said in the lok sabha. reacting to rjd group leader raghuvansh prasad singh's mention of the demonstration, the samata member bluntly remarked, ``all those sitting on dharna at jantar mantar are themselves tainted people.""

29,"Principal canes student, fractures his hand","new delhi: a class xii student of a government school fractured his left hand when the principal caned students, apparently, due to lack of cleanliness in the classroom. the incident happened in sarvodaya vidyalaya in west vinod nagar when the evening shift of boys was in progress and the principal was taking a round of the school. the second period of economics was going on in class xii. on finding the classroom dirty, the principal decided to punish all the 60 students by caning them on the palm. dharmender kumar, who was sitting in a corner in the front row, tried to withdraw his hand. he started crying after he was caned, his classmates said. after the principal left, his classmates took him to the nearby mangalam hospital. according to doctors, 17-year-old dharmender had a hairline fracture and his hand was plastered. however, when spoken to, dharmender refused to comment. the boy's father mukhtiar singh, who is an employee with the postal and telegraph department, had no complaint. ''all teachers and principals have the right to discipline students,'' he said. on his part, principal a p daundiyal said the boy fractured his hand after a fall. he also alleged that the teachers were lending a political hue to the issue. ''the school's result when i joined four years back was 26 per cent. now it is 90 per cent,'' he said. he alleged that the teachers, unhappy with his performance, were instigating the students against him. ''when i asked the students why the classroom was not cleaned, the students spoke to me in a disrespectful tone,'' daundiyal claimed. it was then that he decided to punish the students. students said this was the first instance of the principal caning students. giving the genesis, a teachers said: ''when zonal deputy director nile singh visited the school some time back, he raised the point of cleanliness with the principal. since then, the principal became very concerned about that.'' interestingly, only two persons are employed for cleaning the school for both morning and evening shifts. the school has 60 rooms and more than 2,500 boys study in the evening shift. the students had been instructed to keep the classrooms clean. the incident one again brings to light how several schools in the capital continue to defy a government ban on corporal punishment for disciplining students. the high court too banned corporal punishment in schools, following several such incidents. earlier in february this year, a class vi student of a central delhi school collapsed after she was allegedly hit on the head by the teacher. last year another class vii student reportedly perforated his left eardrum after he was slapped by the school's sports teacher.

""it is peanuts as compared to what i will be able to earn once i start practising as a general surgeon. then why pursue a denigrated profession like politics?"" questions jaydev gadhvi, a ms (general surgery) student of km school of post-graduate medical sciences. official salary of rs 12,000 per month, rs 10,000 constituency allowance, rs 14,000 office expense allowance, transport allowance of rs 8 per km, 25 per cent hike in the daily allowance of rs 400, mobile phones and free electricity and water upto 50,000 units and 4,000 kilo-litres respectively... the recent hike in emoluments of mps is manna from heaven, one would say. but not so for the generation next's wannabe professionals who confess they would consider taking up politics only as the last option...when all other options dry up! ""the hike would be good news for those already in politics... more income is always welcome. but not for me... i am sure i will be able to earn much more after i start my own construction business after completing my engineering. if i fail in that and in all other fields that i may chose, i might consider politics,"" concedes maulin shah, general secretary of ld college of engineering. shah is pursuing de (civil) and plans to go abroad for further studies and start his own construction house later. curiously here, it is not that the salary and other perks are less. it is only that the same is not ""compensation enough"" to enter the big, bad and defamed world of politics. ""politics is basically a thankless job. hard work you may, but all you will get in return is public abuse. no matter how upright or honest you are, you will be viewed as one corrupt baddie, siphoning off the public's hard-earned money"", says akhil bhartiya vidyarthi parishad's state organising secretary govind vagadia , who plans to start his own business. interestingly here, vagadia confesses to feel so from his own experience. ""i have worked as a student leader and have personally witnessed that no student has ever praised the good things that we have been instrumental in bringing out, say, the insurance policy. but all are ever-ready to deride politicians and ever student leaders as corrupt who get admissions at a price and so on and so forth. so its not really worth it"", feels vagadia. shah could not agree more. ""for becoming an mp, one has to minimum invest rs 1 crore. i am the general secretary of my college, i know that entry into any level of politics comes at a specific price-tag. so for a person who has invested rs 1 crore, the hiked salary would mean nothing. he would gain only through corruption and that is something which i am not ready to taint my hands with. small-time student politics is ok, there is nothing exciting about big-time politics"", shah says. bharat dangar ms university students union (msusu) general secretary says, that there are several issues to the rise in mp's emolument. ""on the one hand, it would be wrong to say that those who enter politics do so for the income that it provides, as most politicians have their own business. but on the positive side, it is possible that the salary rise would benefit those who want to work honestly for the society."" prakash verma former msusu vice-president believes that the salary rise per se would not prompt those not interested in politics to enter it. ""most of the politicians enter the field either due to their own social objective or activism or to carry on a family tradition. many politicians are corrupt and the salary increase may not make the field lucrative,"" he said.

33,Finance ministers lambast Centre,"kolkata: imagine the finance minister of a congress-run state lambasting the nehruvian model of planned economy where the planning commission failed imbibe the time component into its gradiose five year plans. or the finance minister of a state ruled by an ally of the national democratic alliance hitting out at the present policies of the government and labelling the current economic crisis worse than that which prevailed in 1990-91 prior to manmohan singh's historic reforms. may sound incredulous but finance ministers of assam and orissa were in a rather candid mood at a confederation of indian industry conference on tuesday. shedding their political garb and guarded statements, the two along with their counterpart from chattisgarh expressed dissatisfaction at the results of reforms and hit out at successive governments for neglecting the east and the northeast. commenting on the role of the planning commission since the early 1950s, assam finance minister d konwar said that while the wise men did a lot of planning on material resources, they discounted one important factor - human resources. ""the time factor was never factored into the planning process, leading to time and cost over-runs. thousands of projects are either incomplete or remain half completed,"" konwar said. the 100 mw karbi-langpi hydel power project which was conceived 14 years ago at a cost of rs 36.36 crore is still incomplete and the cost has risen to nearly rs 400 crore by now. ""it does not make sense to keep projects alive by announcing negligible budgetary provisions to serve political gain,"" he said candidly. konwar alleged that the centre's financial packages were only on paper and very little of it actually percolated down to the states. he was also critical of fellow partyman and former finance minister manmohan singh for agreeing to the gas cracker project in which he had agreed to provide gas to reliance at rs 600 per tonne for 16 years after the commencement of the project. orissa finance minister r k patnaik, who is in the biju janata dal ministry led by navin patnaik, said the current economic situation was worse than that prevelant prior to the reforms. ""in the eighth plan, investment has been lower than that in hte seventh plan. recession has set in and there are no apparent answers. at least, the mess of disinvestment is no answer,"" he said. patnaik also warned all present of the so-called electricity reforms that had first been initiated in orissa. ""peolpe are being compelled to pay higher tariffs while services have worsened. against 43 per cent transmission and distribution (t&d) loss earlier, it is now a mere 2 per cent lower. and not a single paise has been invested in the state power sector,"" he alleged. criticising the world bank for advocating in favour of distribution firms like aes, he said that if the latter threatened to pull out of the state, it would not affect its economy as the orissa electricity board would then step in. ""in any case, our agreement is with cesco and not aes,"" he said. chhattisgarh finance minister r c singh deo said the high debt burden of both the centre and the state governments was a cause of concern for the economy. ""the centre's debt of over rs 700,000 crore is not being used for productive purposes. it should be used in creating infrastructure rather than in restructuring debt,"" he said.
