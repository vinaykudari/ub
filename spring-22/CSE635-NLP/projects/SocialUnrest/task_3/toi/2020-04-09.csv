0,Truckers hold city to ransom as govt remains passive,"MUMBAI: The eight-day-long statewide transportersâ€™ strike may be pushing up your weekly grocery expenditure, but donâ€™t expect the state government to sympathise.

For the first time in years, a strike of this nature has gone on for so long, without the government taking any action.

In the last few years, there have been several strikes by transporters in the city, but the government of the day had always gone on an overdrive to get it called offâ€”usually by holding a series of meetings with union leaders.

These meetings get more frequent and frantic as people get inconvenienced or the price of food starts rising. In some cases, the government has actually contemplated invoking the Essential Services (Maintenance) Act (ESMA) to make the strike illegal, most notably when V.M. Lal was the transport commissioner.

But this time, the government seems to be making little effort to get the strike called off or take punitive action against those holding the city to ransom. The transport ministry held one meeting last week with the transporters, to discuss their options.

(Transporters are seeking to soften the high court orders which have imposed a daily fine of Rs 500 on 15-yearold heavy commercial vehicles plying after March 31). In that meeting, the government â€œrequestedâ€™â€™ the transporters to call off the strike.

State transport minister Ashok Chavan says the government cannot do anything to help the transporters since it is a high court order. â€œOnly the supreme court can do something,â€™â€™ he says. The government has promised full support to the transporters in courtâ€” even filing affidavits in their favour twice in the last six monthsâ€”but seems to be nonchalant about the strike itself.

â€œWe are talking with them. But things are normal in Mumbai. As far as supplies are concerned, I donâ€™t seem much of a problem,â€™â€™ Mr Chavan claims. However, most in political and industry circles do not share Mr Chavanâ€™s views.

Vinod Tawde, president of the Mumbai unit of the BJP, says the government should have taken a pro-active view right from the outset as the problem had been building up for some time. â€œThe government should have taken the stand in the high court that the vehicles plying for more than 15 years will be phased out in three stages within six months: first remove trucks and buses that are 20 to 25 years old, and so on.â€™â€™

â€œEven after the strike began, the government has been laid back about resolving it,â€™â€™Mr Tawde alleged. Meanwhile, export orders are being cancelled, stocks are piling up in godowns pushing up costs. Babulal Todi, president of All India Manufacturers Association urges a quick end to the impasse by bringing the transporters under the ESMA. â€œThe government should discuss problems with the transporters and arrange for soft loans from banks to help them buy new trucks,â€™â€™ he asserted.

Ajay Shah, president of the Bombay Industries Association, complained that a payment crisis had already set in. â€œGoods are stuck at entry and exit points and raw material canâ€™t come in and finished goods canâ€™t go out,â€™â€™ he said. He feared that manufacturers may have to bear the penalty stipulated in many contracts for delay in delivering goods.

A.C. Patankar, a business advisor, fears a law and order problem if the strike is prolonged. Admitting that the truckersâ€™ problems were genuine, he said however that the Bombay high court would not have taken this decision if there was anything on record to show honest efforts to change over to CNG.

1,Scientists asked to study ryots' suicides,"MYSORE: Karnataka agriculture minister V.S. Koujalgi on Wednesday sought the assistance of scientists to tackle problems faced by farmers and asked them to evolve a strategy to end suicides among farmers.

He was addressing delegates at the 10-day annual Facilitator Planning and Refresher Practicum 2003 here. The Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations in association with European Union and the state government has organised the practicum on Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for cotton.

While referring to a spate of farmersâ€™ suicides in the state in the last two years, the minister sought the assistance of scientists to end the problem. He asked them to come up with concrete suggestions.

FAO is executing European Union funded programme â€˜FAO-EU IPM Programme for Cotton in Asiaâ€™ in six countries -India, China, Bangladesh, Vietnam, Phillippines and Pakistan since October 1999. The main objective of the programme is to develop a cadre of cotton IPM facilitators, who will impart knowledge on over-dependence on pesticides in cotton cultivation.

In India, cotton cultivation is a major traditional occupation which provides employment to about 60 million. At present cotton is cultivated in an area of 8.2 million hectares and consumes about 50 per cent of the total pesticides used, though it occupies only 5 per cent of the area of cultivation.

Koujalgi said, cotton cultivation had become risky due to pest attack and added, failure of the crop sometimes drove farmers to take the extreme step.

In his inaugural address, principal secretary of agriculture and horticulture A.K. Agarwal, asked scientists to study whether use of pesticides reduced the life-span of farmers.He observed, pest management should percolate to the base from lab to land, if it had to achieve its goal.

Centreâ€™s additional plant protection adviser-cum-director IPM, Directorate of Plant Protection, Ministry of Agriculture Dr A.D. Pawar said, in the last three years, pesticide use was contained in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra, where IPM programme for cotton was being implemented. He added, the Union government was launching organic farming programme where no chemical pesticides are used.

Around 80 facilitators from Karnataka, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Punjab are participating in the practicum. They will also visit Ballahalli, Jakkahalli and Harohalli in the district to interact with IPM trained farmers. Chief technical adviser of the programme Dr Peter Ooi was present.

2,Ministers oppose cut in farm subsidy,"GANDHINAGAR: The Gujarat governmentâ€™s decision to increase the power bill of farmers by slashing the Rs 55 crore per-month subsidy, given for over two years, came under sharp criticism at the state Cabinet meeting on Wednesday. Several ministers said this would add to the existing burden faced by farmers, who are already reeling under the effects of unprecedented drought.

Sensing the decision might lead to trouble on the farm front, Chief Minister Narendra Modi announced the setting up of a Cabinet sub-committee to review the decision to slash the subsidy. Minister of state for energy Saurabh Patel was particularly asked to be â€œmore sensitiveâ€� towards the needs of the farmers before announcing such decisions. A concession package for the farmers is now being contemplated.

Without the subsidy, the farmers would have had to pay Rs 1,764 per horsepower of unmetered power as against Rs 350-Rs 500 they currently pay. The ministers, including Ramanlal Vora, Narottam Patel and Mangu Patel, said the concessions will be continued till the Narmada waters reach the farms. Amit Shah, a confidant of the chief minister, was sharply criticised for his remark that the farmers were â€œover-exploiting underground waterâ€�.

The discussion on the crucial issue took place during the Cabinet debate on drought, after the CM told the ministers to â€œconvince the MLAs not to grumble about starting relief workâ€� as it led to unnecessary burden on the fund-starved state exchequer. The CM had received reports that the MLAs had complained to the guardian ministers of several districts over the failure of the government to promptly start relief work in the affected areas.

One minister of state, Prabhatsinh Chauhan, is learnt to have forcefully raised the issue of having an MLAsâ€™ meeting to discuss drought-related issues.

State education minister Anandiben Patel, a Modi confidant, complained about widespread corruption in relief work. Mentioning several instances in Viramgam taluka of Ahmedabad district, Anandiben said that on-the-spot checking at one place revealed there were just 1,000 workers at the relief site, even though the muster registered nearly 2,000 workers.

6,SP leader questions validity of party meet,"PATNA: Samata legislature party leader Uma Shankar Singh has sent a letter to the partyâ€™s state convener Vashisth Narayan Singh, MP, informing him that convening of the legislature party meeting by him on April 13 is not only irrelevant but also against the constitutional provisions of the party.

In his letter, Singh said that as per the established norms, it is the duty and responsibility of legislature party leader of any political party to convene such a meeting. Besides, quoting from the written clarification of partyâ€™s national general secretary-cum-spokesman, Shambhu Srivastava, to the Election Commission (EC), he informed Vashisth Narayan Singh that his appointment as the convener of the Bihar state committee had been made under an ad hoc arrangement, only to look after the membership drive and facilitate the internal elections of the party.

Attaching a photocopy of the Srivastavaâ€™s letter to the EC, he stated that since his appointment is only for specific tasks as an interim arrangement till the elections are over, he should not cross his limit by convening a meeting and establish a precedent. â€œA formal approval of convening such an unconstitutional meeting by you can not be given, which can not be taken cognizance ofâ€�, he stated.

Meanwhile, Samata Party leader in the legislative council P K Sinha has said that since the membership drive has already ended and Rana Gangeshwar Prasad Singh has already been appointed state returning officer by the national committee from a panel of three names suggested by the state executive committee of the party, he is fully authorised to conduct internal elections under the party constitution. â€œHe may appoint office-bearers to assist him in his works, if he so desires. Vashisth Narayan Singh has no right or responsibility in the organisational matterâ€�, he added.

â€œWhen party leaders, who have now publicly accepted that state executive committee exists, the meeting of the state executive or the state council can only be convened by partyâ€™s vice-president, as the post of state president is vacant, and no other office-bearersâ€�, Sinha added. He requested Singh to postponed the meetings convened by him.

8,PPCB chief rules out forcible compliance,"LUDHIANA: Terming the reports asking certain categories of manufacturing units in the state to install technologies recommended by consultants of Punjab State Council for Science and Technology (PSCST) as wrong, Punjab Pollution Control Board chairman NS Tiwana, sought to clarify that the exercise was not meant to make money by subjecting the units to forcible compliance of board recommendations.

Tiwana, who holds charge of both organisations, while talking to TNN after a workshop on pollution control, said the exercise was meant to help the entrepreneurs from being fleeced by private consultants. At the same time, the purpose was to provide them quality service at reasonable cost, he said.

The issue had been talked about in hushed tones so far without anybody coming out in open. An advertisement had been issued some time ago asking new cupla furnaces and rice sheller units to avail consultancy service regarding the project design and feasibility report. The entrepreneurs, though conceding the recommendatory nature of exercise, had been alleging bureaucratic insistence on compulsory compliance. The matter was also raised during the workshop.

Claiming that the entrepreneurs were under no compulsion, Tiwana asserted that PPCB had not authorised any consultants. We have only made arecommendation, which is not binding on anybody, he said. And that the aim was to help entrepreneurs get quality service.

Putting things in perspective, Tiwana said they had been receiving complaints from various quarters of the industry since 1983 about being charged exorbitantly by private consultants. A Consultancy Cell was set up in PSCST in 1992, through a resolution, to provide service without overcharging. As per norms, the government committed to fund the council for three years, after which it was to operate on self-sustaining basis. The initial charges for these low cost technologies developed for furnaces was raised from Rs 2,000 to Rs 20,000,and such technologies were developed for as many as 14 categories, he said.

Tiwana justified the existing consultancy charges in view of the annual cost of running the Cell that comes to about Rs 60 lakh. However, a discount up to 50 per cent was offered as in the case of brick-kiln forming cluster of about 50 units, he said, while claiming that these units profited from the consultancy as it enabled them to Rs 3 lakh on per year cost of coal.

12,Bihar minister Surendra Prasad Yadav quits,"PATNA: Junior minister for excise Surendra Prasad Yadav submitted his resignation letter to the chief minister on Wednesday, even as the police said there was no â€œtimeframeâ€� for the arrest of Surendra, MLC Azad Gandhi and Pappu Yadav, brother-in-law of the CMâ€™s brother Subhash Yadav.

The resignation letter was forwarded to the Raj Bhavan around 2 pm for being accepted. A Gaya court had issued non-bailable warrants against the three in connection with a kidnapping case.

According to police sources, Gaya SP Raveendran Sankaran has asked the officials of Rampur police to include Patna DSP (law and order) Shashi Bhushan Sharma on the list of accused. â€œThe resignation letter has been forwarded to the governor,â€� said RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav while insisting that the matter was sub judice and that the law would take its own course.

Surendra became the sixth minister to quit the present Rabri Devi government on being charged with unlawful acts. Surendra is reported to have gone to Subhashâ€™s house and sent his resignation letter to the CM through an aide. However, Subhash denied that Surendra had visited his house.

Even as the police arrested police constables Niyaz Khan and Mahendra Singh and sub-inspector Ramakant Ram (who is also a complainant in the case lodged against Surendra), DIG and spokesman of the police headquarters Rituraj said, â€œThere is no timeframe for the arrest of other accused. The police are in the process of implementing the non-bailable warrants against them.â€�

He said the three policemen had been arrested because of their involvement in the illegal confinement of Atul Prakash, a fraud case accused. Surendra, Azad and Pappu were reported to be in Patna, but the police had not made any move to arrest them till evening.

Meanwhile, Prakash filed a complaint case in Patna CJMâ€™s court against SI Ramakant Ram and two constables for kidnapping him.

Prakash said in the complaint that Ram and two constables had gone to Anand district in Gujarat on April 2 to bring him to Patna in connection with a Rs 5 lakh fraud case. Azad and Pappu were along with the policemen to identify him.

He had asked the SI at the time they were boarding the Rajdhani Express in Delhi as to why they were boarding the train for Gaya instead of Patna.

After reaching Gaya, the SI asked him to give Rs 50,000 and save himself from paying Rs 5 lakh on reaching Patna. On this, he asked for two daysâ€™ time to arrange the money, during which he and the policemen were asked to stay in a small room. After the expiry of time when he could not arrange the money, the SI became furious and started torturing and abusing him, Prakash maintained.

The CJM directed the police to institute a case against the SI and two constables.

Surendra moved a bail petition in the Gaya CJMâ€™s court on Wednesday.

13,Principals' meeting with CM a pressure ploy: Complainants,"LUDHIANA: The complainants alleging donation demanded by two leading city schools for admissions on Wednesday termed the reported meeting of one of the principals with the Punjab chief minister as pressure tactics to thwart enquiry against them ordered by the deputy commissioner.

As many as five complainants told newspersons that though similar complaints had been made against some schools previously, no action was initiated by the district administration.

They said that now when the present DC ordered enquiry into the case following complaints by them, the schools are now trying to stop this through influence of political bigwigs.

A complainant â€” Rajiv Kalia had complained against DAV Public School BRS Nagar and Sacred Heart Senior Secondary School Sarabha Nagar for demanding donation to admit his ward in elementary class.

Taking cognizance of the matter the DC ordered an enquiry that is being conducted by additional deputy commissioner Rahul Bhandari. Other principals of both schools were summoned by ADC and in their presence statements of complainants were recorded.

Though the principals were asked to submit written replies but extended the date on request. The complainants included Dr Deepak Jain, Munish Kumar, Rajan Jain and Manu Nanda. Meanwhile, Kalia had moved the High Court on behalf of his minor son Jatin Kalia. The court has fixed May 8 as next date of hearing. The remaining four complainants said that they too would move court if the outcome of the ongoing enquiry is not fruitful.

14,Just wait for Cong govt: YSR,"CHEVELLA: Setting off on his 1600 km walkathon from this town about 40 km from Hyderabad, Congress leader Y S Rajasekhara Reddy on Wednesday tossed a challenging proposition to the people and to the ruling Telugu Desam Party in particular: Just wait for the Congress to come to power.

And when that eventuality happens, the Congress Legislature Party leader asserted, the party would implement his promise of free electricity for farmers regardless of any reformist rationale against such a sop.

Addressing a well-attended meeting before starting off on his 60-day journey through 11 drought-hit districts, Rajasekhara Reddy said he respected the sentiments of the people of Telangana and lashed out at the TDP government for â€˜neglectingâ€™ their interests.

â€œIt is the TDP which is opposing the creation of a second States Reorganisation Committee despite Sonia Gandhi asking the Centre to do so,â€� he pointed out.

PCC president M Satyanarayana Rao said the Congress bore no political motives behind the padayatra, while Telangana Congress Legislators Forum (TCLF) convener A Indrakaran Reddy encouraged Rajasekhara Reddy to get to know the Telangana peopleâ€™s problems better during his walkathon.

Before going to Chevella in a convoy of 500 vehicles, the CLP leader stopped to garland a variety of statues: Rajiv Gandhi at Somajiguda, Mahatma Gandhi at the Assembly and Ambedkar at Tank Bund. He also visited a dargah at Nampally and a temple at Lunger Houz.

The entire route from Hyderabad to Chevella was painted with the colours of the national flag (or the Congress pennant, from a different perspective). Security personnel threw a ring around the chief marcher but had a tough time keeping the crowd at an armâ€™s distance.

The public meeting at a market yard in Chevella took place under a fierce sun. In a gesture to the scores of people including senior leaders sitting in the audience, Rajasekhara Reddy bid local MLA Sabita Indra Reddy to remove the white cloth providing shade to the dais. Enthused by this, Congress workers removed even the shamiana erected for mediapersons.

When the march finally got under away, the sun eased up a little and a light dusty breeze blew along. About 2,000 people, including MLAs, MPs, and zilla parishad chairpersons, walked with Rajasekhara Reddy on Day 1. The march stopped for the night at Manneguda village. The Congress leader was stopped at several places by his supporters during his padayatra.

Meanwhile, in Vizianagaram, chief minister Chandrababu Naidu said on Wednesday that leader of the opposition Y S Rajasekhara Reddyâ€™s padayatra had more to do with overcoming problems he is facing within his own party rather than the peopleâ€™s distress due to drought in the state. Naidu told reporters, â€œAs all we know, the Congress is full of internal problems. He (Rajasekhara Reddy) is going on a padayatra to overcome those problems. I am at a loss to understand how such yatras will relieve the people from the severe drought.â€�

The fever has come down in most cases and their chest X-ray shows no signs of pneumonia, he said. The severe acute respiratory syndrome has so far claimed 106 lives in the 16 countries that it has affected so far.

Aggarwal said the US national detained at Mumbai airport on Tuesday was ``being discharged''''. Her two associates, who were kept under observation at RML hospital had already been discharged. Officials said extra precautions were being taken with suspected SARS cases as the tests available so far had a high risk of giving out a false negative report. Even in a second test of the sample, there was a 30 per cent risk of a false negative result, Aggarwal said.

18,Wildlife: Good news or flawed vision?,"NEW DELHI: The Union environment ministry says the number of tigers and elephants countrywide seem stable and the numbers of leopards, lions and rhinos are actually going up causing conservationists to question the methodology.

According to the census, tiger numbers are down from about 3,800 in 1997 to 3,642 in 2001-02. Elephant numbers were put at over 28,000 in 2001, down from 29,000 in 1997 but up from 1993â€™s 25,541.

Rhinos increased in numbers from under 1,500 in 1993 to 1,817 in 1999. Lions, their range limited to the Gir sanctuary, increased in numbers from 304 in 1995 to over 320 in 2001. Uttar Pradesh has the dubious distinction of topping the list in leopard and tiger poaching.

â€˜â€˜At best, the numbers are stable,â€™â€™ says recently retired additional director-general (wildlife) S C Sharma. â€˜â€˜Growth has not been possible.â€™â€™ Conservationist Ashok Kumar says numbers tend to be inflated, with the analysis less than believable.

Six-year-old leopard numbers are the most controversial. The ministry says the numbers of this animal rose from 6,828 in 1993 to 7,273 in 1997. The past six years have seen such poaching pressure on the leopard that Kumar doubts very much that numbers could have gone up. The numbers of this resilient animal, he says, is â€˜â€˜exceedingly difficult to estimateâ€™â€™, the methodology being shaky.

Sharma tends to agree, saying at least a thousand animals must have been killed, even on a rough estimate, since the last census. The ministry says 404 leopard poaching cases were reported between 1999 and 2002.

Kumarâ€™s hypothesis is that the past few years have witnessed a greater demand for leopard skins in the Western fashion industry and poached skins may be mixing with legal skins from Africa.

19,Iraqi embassy still represents Saddam's govt,"NEW DELHI: While the Saddam Hussein regime seems to have gone underground and the appurtenances of its power destroyed, one corner of Delhi remains firmly committed to the deposed president: The Iraqi embassy continues to represent Saddam Hussein''s government in India, undaunted by the rapid changes that have taken place in Baghdad over the past two days.

In fact, Iraq''s diplomatic representatives here seem completely unfazed by the possibility that they may soon become persona non grata. ""As far as I am concerned"", says Iraqi charge d''affaires Adday O Al-Sakab, ""I am still representing the Iraqi government in India"".

Asked for the Indian government''s view, the external affairs ministry spokesperson said that a decision on the embassy''s status would be taken ""in accordance with standard diplomatic practice."" He, however, emphasised that the situation was ""fluid"".

Sakab told the The Times of India on Thursday that though he has had no communication with Baghdad for several days, he is in constant touch with Iraq''s friends in India. ""I am constantly getting calls and messages of support"" he says, asserting that ""Indian people are our friends.""

Sakab declares that Iraq is very satisfied with the Lok Sabha''s anti-war resolution. He cites the use of the Hindi word `ninda'' to argue that the Indian government has been supportive of Iraq. ""Even some of our Arab friends did not make such statements. We are very satisfied. We were expecting it because of our Indian friends.""

The MEA, however, has already started looking at the situation post-Saddam. Though the ministry spokesperson replied to a question on whether India still recognised Saddam by saying: ""I have not made any announcement on this issue"", he said that India''s primary concerns at this time were Saddam of law and order, territorial integrity and sovereignty of Iraq and Iraq''s humanitarian needs. India had always expressed its desire for an immediate end to the war and early withdrawal of forces, he said.

On its part, the business community went a step ahead with FICCI declaring its intention to send ""a delegation immediately to the UN office of Iraq programme"" to discuss ""for fructification of Rs 3000 crores of goods and material to be supplied before May 12.

In addition, FICCI declared, the delegation would ""also be visiting Washington to meet the US organisations designated for the reconstruction of Iraq to seek India''s participation."" The delegation, FICCI said, was ""likely to be led by Secretary (ANA) in the Ministry of External affairs, R M Abhyankar"".

20,Industrialists slam govt for appalling work culture,"SILIGURI: North Bengal will never be industrially developed because of faulty policies and appalling work culture in most of the government departments, claimed the Joint Action Committee of Industrial Associations of North Bengal.

In a letter to the west Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on April 4,the JAC complained against the ""negative, hostile and delaying tactics"" of departments like West Bengal Pollution Control Board and West Bengal State Electricity Board.

According to convener of the association S Paul, the harassment meted out by the PCB Siliguri office has reached such a stage that the association was forced to make specific complaints against some officials.

At a press meet on Wednesday night, armed with documents, he even claimed that the board officials were involved in various monitory irregularities.

Paul further informed that the association would stop paying the enhanced security deposit of Rs 1,200 per HP to the SEB as it had increased from Rs 200 per HP in the last 20 years over a number of phases, but only for those applying for new connections.

SEB demanded that all old connection holders, too, should pay as per the new rate, which is irrational.

""A 20-year-old 1,000 HP consuming enterprise will have to deposit an additional Rs 12 lakh for which the department will not pay any interest,"" added Paul.
