0,India opening up to art as investment,"NEW DELHI: Realistically, most average investors are likely to restrict themselves to contemporary art - where prices can be low and returns often spectacular - or the even more speculative ''collectables'' market.

Says art collector Harsh Goenka: ""I have always bought from the heart. The only two paintings I have ever bought as an investment are a Tayeb Mehta and an N S Bendre - the value of both has appreciated by over 700 per cent but they are not my personal favourites. In fact, I''d say the liquidity of art is not very good. Art must be collected as a passion.""

Sharan Apparao of Apparao Galleries claims that investing in art internationally makes for good business sense since the market has a lot of backup in the form of insurance, resale, art finances and the like.

""There is no clear pricing strategy for art in India right now. In fact, it is only in the last five years that India has published figures as far as art prices are concerned.""

The final word comes from Vadehra though: ""For those who enjoy and appreciate it, art is a sound investment. It provides visual pleasure and also translates into money growing on the walls.""

1,They pay the price for boycotting polls,"LUCKNOW: ""They boycotted the election. Now let them suffer."" This was the reaction of city mayor Dr SC Rai to the plight of Jankipuram residents, when the matter was brought to his notice on Saturday.

Residents of Sector-I, Jankipuram, have been doing the rounds of civic bodies for the last four years for street lights. Though they pay all civic taxes, they have been deprived of this amenity. The residents, mainly retired senior citizens, are unable to fathom as to why civic departments left out Sector I from the street light map. All other streets in Jankipuram have lights. The residents had no inkling on the disappointment in store for them, when they boycotted elections, hoping that their work would be done.

Lucknow Development Authority (LDA) had handed over Sector I to LMC for street lighting on June 1, 2001 and the document had been duly signed by municipal commissioner SP Singh and the then LDA VC Diwakar Tripathi. But LMC officials insist that it was handed over on March 1 last. Talking to Times news Network on April 5, 2004, municipal commissioner SP Singh had assured that the lights would be installed within 10 days. Over a month later, not even a pole is in sight, leave alone lights. An LMC official claimed that street lights could not be installed due to implementation of the model code of conduct. Incidentally, the model code of conduct does not bar any civic agency from providing the basic civic necessities to residents during elections.

Dr Rai, while talking to TNN on Saturday, vented his ire on Jankipuram residents for not participating in the polls. But he said he had received the file regarding the sector on Saturday and would look into the matter. Once again, an assurance has been given that the sector would have street lights within 10 days.

2,Satyam murder: Residents continue protest,"PATNA: Residents of Bari Path locality continued their protest on Saturday against the killing of a 16-year-old boy, Satyam. They blocked the road at different points on Ashok Rajpath and Bari Path.

Police had to use mild force to disperse the mob and remove blockades. The police lobbed more than half a dozen teargas on the spot. Satyam''s uncle Subodh was also beaten up by the police.

Later, administration held talks with a delegation of local residents requesting them to stop the agitation.

""We want to concentrate our energy to ensure the conviction of all the arrested persons involved in the killing of Satyam,"" town DSP R K Dubey told the agitators.

Satyam''s family members were unhappy with the failure of the police of Gopalpur outpost in identifying Satyam''s body. In-charge of district control room Rajnish Kumar Singh also participated in the negotiation between administration and the agitators.

Satyam was kidnapped on April 28. Police investigation disclosed that Satyam had been killed by his kidnappers in a house in Sorangpur area under the Gopalpur outpost.

""Had they made real efforts, they would have succeeded in ascertaining the identity of the recovered body,"" said Satyam''s uncle Subodh who is an advocate.

Earlier, Gopalpur police cremated the body after recovering the same near a godown in Sorangpur. Dubey said Satyam''s father identified an amulet wore by the Satyam at the time of incident. However, Satyam''s mother Ragini is yet to believe that her son is no more.

""I still hope my son would return one day,"" she told TNN at her residence.

She said she had offered the criminals Rs 50,000 for the release of his son while talking to them on phone. ""But they have now stopped making phone calls to us,"" she remarked in choked voice.

3,Peaceful polls due to me: Laloo,"NEW DELHI: On Saturday it was RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav''s turn to come to the Election Commission requesting it not to pay much heed to the demand of countermanding election in Chhapra or repoll in other places.

While praising the EC, the state government and himself for what he claimed a ""peaceful election in Bihar"", Laloo alleged that NDA leaders are trying to mislead the commission by concocting flimsy charges of rigging.

In fact, Laloo alleged that BSF personnel helped voters in two polling stations of Madhepura to cast votes. He demanded action against erring officials. ""Their action would lower the credibility of para-military forces,"" he said.

After nearly a half-an-hour meeting with EC''s top brass, the RJD chief told reporters that the EC should do what it deems fit.

He said that Rajiv Pratap Rudy, his opponent in Chhapra, is making allegations since he knows he would be defeated. ""This is their old trick to save themselves from the ignominy of defeat.""

In Chhapra, Laloo said a false picture has been presented to the EC by Rudy. Therefore, he said, ""We have requested the EC not to get carried away but do what it considers to be right. The EC can order repoll in booths where it feels there was rigging. We are not making any such demand since the election was peaceful,"" he said.

Laloo also gave to the commission documents of a flat owned by Rudy''s wife, a fact which, he alleged, has been concealed in his declaration affidavit.

The RJD chief also maintained that the polling in Siwan and Bettiah, two constituencies where inquiry has been ordered by the EC, was peaceful and even repolling has been completed.

Referring to JD(U)''s demands for repolling in over 200 booths in Madhepura, where Laloo Yadav is pitted against his friend-turned-foe Sharad Yadav, the former Bihar chief minister maintained that polling was peaceful in that key constituency.

He said the EC gave him a patient hearing and promised to take appropriate decision. ""I am fully satisfied with EC''s assurance,"" he added.
