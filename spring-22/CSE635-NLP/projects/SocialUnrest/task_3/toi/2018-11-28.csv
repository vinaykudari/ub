0,Law to limit ministers favoured,"new delhi: union cabinet ministers lk advani and arun shourie would both like a law limiting the number of ministers in a union or state government. during a debate on extending president's rule in manipur in the rajya sabha on tuesday, both spoke of how the situation there had got so bad. both said the way parties swelled or shrank overnight, depending on who was ready to accommodate how many into power was a regular and disgusting feature. in a 60-member house, it was usual to have 40 or more ministers. mlas change party labels with aclarity for power. ''when we in parliament amended the constitution in 1993 to give delhi a legislative assembly and a council of ministers, we had it say there would be no more than seven ministers. it had a very good effect,'' said advani. ''i think we should try for a consensus to have the same thing in the north-east. and why only in the north-east, why not the whole country?'' he added. ''the anti-defection law has not achieved its end; the effort to accommodate genuine splits in a party by saying if a third of the legislators break away, they don't lose their seats has defeated the purpose,'' said advani. ''everyone's concentrating all the time on how to get the number of mlas with you to that one-third figure. i personally would advocate if anyone quits a party on whose ticket he's elected, he must lose the seat, too,'' he said.

1,Three of a family die in suicide pact,"hyderabad: in a suicide pact, three of the six members of a family died due to the consumption of poison at their residence. the incident occurred in the rikabgunj area of the old city on monday night when a housewife, p meena bai (35) administered poison to the entire family by mixing it in milk and soft drinks. as a result, her sons santosh yadav (18) and sai krishna yadav (10), daughters sapna (17) and aarti (15) and their 15-year-old maid-servant lakshmi fell unconscious. all were rushed to the osmania hospital by the neighbours where meena bai, krishna yadav and lakshmi succumbed on tuesday morning while others are in a critical condition. according to charminar police, meena's husband p mallesh yadav, a milk vendor, was having an affair with a woman lakshmi bai of dhoolpet for the last few months. on learning about the affair, meena had an argument with her husband and asked him to end the affair. but mallesh refused saying that she should not object to any of his activities as he was fulfilling the needs of the family. police suspect that this could be the reason that led meena to commit suicide and out of frustration she poisoned the entire family. however, meena's parents alleged that the family was poisoned by mallesh himself as he wanted to kill everyone for marrying lakshmi bai. mallesh was taken into custody and a case has been registered against him for abetting his wife in suicide. further investigations are on.

2,Fight caste discrimination as political evil: VHP,"hyderabad:caste discrimination has to be fought more as a political evil than a religious one, according to vishwa hindu parishad zonal organising secretatry k koteshwara sharma. sharma, who is in charge of karnataka and andhra pradesh units of the vhp, said discrimination in india today was caused more by the political mobilisation in the name of caste than the casteist mentality itself. unless people realise that they are being divided into vote banks in the name of caste, this evil will not end, he said. however, if the battle against untouchability is waged through the temples by appointing dalits as archakas, as proposed by kancha iliah, the vishwa hindu parishad would not object to it, he added. he cautioned that the process of eliminating caste evils from the hindu society will have to be a long-drawn process. anything done at short notice or any radical moves always evokes protests, he warned. sharma said the parishad itself has been providing archaka training to dalits in the rural areas of the southern states.in tamil nadu alone, we trained around 60,000 dalit youths, he added.these archakas mostly perform duties at the village temple or the gramadevata. the vhp member clarified that he was not subscribing to the view that archakas should be appointed against the sampradayam (traditions) of a temple.this is because maintaining the sampradayam of a temple is considered integral to preserving its sanctity. if such a move is considered, the opinion of matadipathis of the state should be sought, he said. hitherto, the problem in defining a commonly acceptable solution to the problems of hinduism was that there was no common platform to discuss issues, he said. we have been successful in at least bringing the various matadipathis together under one roof, he said.the vhp felt that there was still a lack of unity among the leaders of various sects and thus it felt the time was not right to propose religious reforms, he said.

4,Oil industry takes over from Assam govt,"duliajan: need vehicles to conduct a public programme? or, spruce up the approach road for a meeting venue? require a new school building? or, replenish medicine stocks in a dilapidated village hospital? well, in the oil country of upper assam, the option is simple - approach the oil majors operating out of here. in a state where the government is crippled with a major financial crisis and vital developmental work has come to a grinding halt, people are increasingly turning to the oil industry for succour. from uplift of educational institutions to sports promotion, from rural development activities to welfare services like supporting spastic schools, the industry has gradually incorporated all these in its charter of activities. at his office in the oil india limited (oil) headquarters at this oil township in dibrugarh district, public relations manager prasanta barkotoky and his department screens as many as twenty-five to thirty such requests every month. ""people look forward to our company. we are trying to get involved in the developmental process. the requirement is not much...all that is needed is a sympathetic attitude"", barkakoty feels. ""as part of our corporate social responsibility, we not only create social assets but also extend periodic assistance to various institutions."" as many as 689 odd villages in the three upper assam districts of sibsagar, dibrugarh and tinsukia have benefited from the oil largesse. ""simultaneously, we are also running the area development scheme, a long-term programme looking into education, construction of roads, educational institutions, primary health centres and the like in a particular area. annually, we spend rs 3.2 crores for developmental activities - rs 220 lakhs under our social welfare programme and another rs 100 lakhs for area development - primarily in and around these three districts"", the oil executive said. close monitoring and community involvement ensures that the oil schemes are, in most cases, a runaway success. take for example the sleepy little village of salmari close to here, which witnessed a rapid transition after oil involved the local youth club, salmari dighalia yuba sangha, while starting welfare projects here. ""till a few years back, our village was in a bad shape. development seemed an alien word to us. then, oil came and the transformation began. they constructed our roads. under the oil rural development society, an agriculture cooperative project - which will benefit two hundred odd households - was started"", pointed out a grateful manimanik gogoi, the secretary of the sangha. the local school got a facelift, while construction of the village auditorium was initiated. binanda gogoi, another local, says with a tinge of pride in his voice: ""our village, with financial assistance from oil, also hosted a rural sports meet for about one thousand odd school children. we plan to make it an annual event."" inspired and eager to establish salmari as a model village, motivated villagers next turned to the nearest primary health centre at nahoroni, manually working on a chosen day (shram daan) to white-wash and repair the dilapidated hospital even as local businessmen donated fans, cement bags and whatever else they could. ""the villagers' concern is touching. we will also pitch in and develop the hospital"", assures oil public relations executive, tridiv hazarika, who has been handling the salmari affairs of the company.

8,Speaker calls all-party meet over Fernandes issue,"new delhi: lok sabha speaker g m c balayogi has convened a meeting of floor leaders of political parties thursday to resolve the government-opposition stand-off over the re-induction of george fernandes as defence minister. the government does not favour the congress notice of censure motion on the matter being admitted as it feels the prerogative of the prime minister cannot be questioned, parliament sources said. the decision to hold an all-party meeting was taken at a meeting of the business advisory committee of lok sabha on wednesday. though congress agrees that induction of a minister was the prime minister's prerogative, it is of the view that the ""propriety"" of certain actions of the government can be raised in the house. the sources refused to divulge the exact wording of the congress' notice, but said if a way out of the deadlock was found at wednesday's meeting the issue is likely to be taken up in the house on december 6. the government does not want the prime minister to respond in the house on the re-induction of fernandes, who had quit in the wake of the tehelka expose, which is still being probed by a judicial commission. the congress, which has given a notice for discussion under a clause which requires voting, is of the view that re-induction of fernandes had no parallel or precedent in political history of independent india. the ayodhya issue, which was to be discussed in the house this week, has now been scheduled for monday, the sources said.

9,RJD to protest 'disrespect' to Rabri,"patna: bihar law minister and a senior lawyer shakeel ahmed khan on wednesday claimed that the life of rjd president laloo prasad yadav lodged in judicial custody at a camp jail in ranchi in connection with the multi-crore fodder scam was in danger and threatened to launch a movement for the ouster of the babulal marandi government. he said rjd workers would launch a concerted movement to overthrow jharkhand government for showing 'disrespect' to bihar chief minister rabri devi at ranchi on tuesday. khan told reporters here that the rjd preisident had been lodged in a dilapidated guest house at ranchi. ""we feel that yadav can face attack from his detractors as proper security arrangements had not been made by the jharkhand government in total violation of the jail manual"", he said. khan, however, did not disclose the date for launching the movement against the marandi government but said the rjd would move a petition before the jharkhand government for not maintaining the minimum decorum in receiving the bihar chief minister. there was hardly any security or protocol at the ranchi airport and the chief minister went to beacon factory camp jail at kanke in a bihar government car to meet her husband, he said. the facilities made available to laloo prasad yadav at the camp jail were even less than the facilities being made available in the houses constructed under indira awas yojna meant for people living below poverty line, he alleged.

13,French govt aid for heritage conservation project,"ahmedabad: the french government on wednesday bestowed a million euros (approximately rs 4 crore) grant to amc for the heritage conservation project of ahmedabad. the money will be used to part-finance preservation of the walled city. ambassador of france in india bernard de monteferrand made the announcement during the inaugural function of sambhav iii _ a seminar on the conservation and revitalisation of urban heritage of ahmedabad. the programme is the first-ever indo-french heritage exercise in the country that looks to adopt the legal structure to prevent damage to heritage structures in the walled city, to garner financial assistance for repair and maintenance of privately-owned heritage buildings, and to preserve the physical and socio-cultural structure of ahmedabad's kot vistar (old city). monteferrand said, ""president of france, who was the guest of honour during the 50th anniversary of independence celebrations in india in 1998, had proposed for co-operation in the field of heritage conservation. ahmedabad was chosen as the city where the first comprehensive joint exercise is being undertaken. ahmedabad presents a unique combination of historic urban architecture and interesting contemporary architecture to which french technicians have made significant contributions in the past."" he added, ""one of the key challenges of an enterprise of this kind is to preserve heritage, at the same time improving living conditions in the historic city and enabling the citizens to access modern amenities of life. this project is multi-disciplinary and there has been a remarkable co-operation between indian and french experts. the product of this two years of reflection has been a set of very pragmatic and specific proposals on technical, legal and financial aspects of the walled city revitalisation."" earlier, mayor himmatsinh patel said, ""the city has already lost many of its heritage structures due to ignorance among the masses. but, now that amc has taken upon itself this responsibility of conservation, one is sure that the future generations will have the old ahmedabad city retained in its age-old ambience complete with artefacts and heritage buildings"". the exercise has its genesis in 'sambhava i' and 'sambhava ii' which were held in the city in 1998 and 1999 respectively. during this period the french experts had pooled their experience with indian counterparts (namely heritage cell of the amc) and intach. this was after the signing of an mou between the government of france and the amc. sambhava iii, which highlights the conclusions of this couple of years' worth exercise, has also got a significant addition to its list of heritage conservationists _ housing and urban development corporation (hudco). hudco has volunteered to be the steering body for getting financial assistance and give out loans for conservation of privately-owned heritage structures in the walled city. using the french contribution, worth rs 4.5 crore, interest on loans given out by hudco to residents of the walled city will be lower than the going market rates. municipal commissioner p panneervel told tnn: ""we are looking at an interest rate that will hover around five per cent."" p s rana from hudco added, ""a strategy for heritage financing has been jointly designed by the french government, amc and our experts. this will be fine-tuned during this three-day seminar. we will have brainstorming sessions to arrive at interest rate to be charged for giving loans to heritage building owners."" apart from the multi-crore grant, which was made in view of the damage caused by january 26 earthquake, the government of france has also decided to depute a french architect who will work in close collaboration with amc and hudco.

14,Famished AMC gives new car to political bosses,"ahmedabad: what would you do if you are going through a lean financial phase ? cut down on expenses and save for a rainy day? if you're looking for an exception to this virtual thumb rule, then take a trip to the ahmedabad municipal corporation. you would find two new maruti esteems being washed and polished, waiting for the exalted occupants to arrive. walk up the wooden staircases of the corporation to the various civic committee offices and you might chance upon excited chats and preparations for excursions. compare that with the amc's dipping financial health and you have got the picture. while the octroi collections continue to stand at five per cent below last year's collections and property tax earnings show a bigger dip, celebrations for the political wing continue unabated. post-diwali these expenses could make a dent in the civic body's finances to the tune of rs 30 - 35 lakh. thanks to a resolution by standing committee, deputy mayor khemchand solanki and chairman badruddin sheikh have new esteems. had the now much-talked about cash flow been as usual the leader of congress and bjp, too, would have new maruti esteems at their disposal while yet another one would be a stand by. after all one has to consider the image of the country's oldest civic body (established in 1858). while five such cars could cost rs 22 lakh (the two already bought have taken rs 11 lakh off from corporation's coffers), the recreational and cultural committee has sought rs 5 lakh from the amc for a trip to ooty. that's not all. the housing and improvement committee left on november 24 for a visit to slum quarters of mumbai and pune with an advance of rs 1.5 lakh. the water supply and solid waste management committees, too, have proposed trips to bangalore and other cities of the south, ostensibly to study systems there. the paradox does not end there as the cash-strapped amc has stopped payments to the ahmedabad municipal transport services. the municipal transport committee on wednesday passed a proposal to demand for rs 19 crore from the administrators of the corporation. ""this amount was set aside for amts in the annual general budget. but, no monetary sanctions had yet been made from april,"" the committee stated.

15,Modi rules out early Assembly polls,"gandhinagar: the ruling bjp is unlikely to go in for early assembly elections. ending speculation in political and bureaucratic circles, chief minister modi said on wednesday that those who are talking of mid-term polls ""are merely spreading a canard meant for misinformation"". averring there is ""no reason"" for holding polls ahead of schedule, in february 2003, modi, who addressed his second news conference ever since he took over on october 7, however, refused to divulge from where he would contest assembly elections. ""it will be one of the 182 state assembly seats."" top bjp circles said he would contest polls much before the legal deadline in march, may be even before february 15, when the assembly is scheduled to meet. the cm's clarification on a controversial issue came even as he moved forward in further distancing himself from his predecessor keshubhai patel. coming out of the weekly cabinet meeting, modi announced the decision to appoint senior ministers purshottam rupala and ik jadeja as his official spokespersons. rupala and jadeja, known to be allies of the cabinet's no 2 suresh mehta, were not inducted into the cabinet by keshubhai, despite repeated demands by mehta. rupala is also close to bjp mp dilip sanghani, a known modi supporter who on tuesday was appointed the state bjp vice-president. modi also displayed clear indications of his intention to give weightage to a political programme of action, rather than a harsh economic agenda, by announcing a plan to ensure that welfare schemes, central or state, reach beneficiaries. ""we will be holding district-level fairs to make people aware of the welfare schemes and find out whether they have benefited,"" modi said. the fairs, which will begin soon after the december 23 village panchayat polls, will be attended by secretaries and ministers. a committee will be formed to work out the details. ""both rural and urban beneficiaries will be covered,"" said modi. ""for instance, we would like to know whether the widow pension scheme is working normally."" in yet another important decision meant to woo the common masses, the cabinet on wednesday raised the financial limit of small cause court cases from rs 5,000 to rs 2 lakh. rupala told newspersons that since 1961, the financial limit of the small cause court had remained rs 5,000. as a result, the district courts were flooded with cases, while there was little work with the small-cause courts. ""with the important decision, the problem of inordinate delay will be met."" rupala pointed out that only recently, the state government had raised the financial limit of the taluka-level civil cases from rs 50,000 to rs 1 lakh for the rural people. ""the new decision will help the urban dwellers. the limit has been fixed at rs 2 lakh, as land prices in urban areas are higher.""

19,KCC Bank stir continues; govt yet to act,"dharwad: the stoic silence of cooperation minister d.k. shivakumar over the murky affairs of karnataka central cooperative bank, dharwad, has raised eyebrows here. the minister, who had inspected the bank four months ago, was so enraged by the mismanagement that he had threatened to supersede the bank and initiate legal action against the management. the bank continues to be mismanaged and the minister has forgotten what he had said. many others remember: a shocked shivakumar had given the officials an eight-day deadline to recover loans, and a threat to supersede the bank management. employees of the bank have struck work for the past five days, protesting gross mismanagement by bank president shivakumargouda patil and his team. business in its 90 branches has come to a grinding halt. the 85-year-old kcc bank, nourished into a sound financial organisation to cater to farmers by the old guard like rao bahadur rudragouda artal and shantaveerappa menasinakai, is now in deep debt. when shivakumargouda, son of former cooperation minister s.s. patil, took over as president, the people of dharwad district expected the bank to grow in strength. patil represents mundargi. ironically, the bank suffered a severe setback: scandals surfaced and the bank fell speedily into the debt trap. shivakumargouda has been charged with sanctioning loans to his cohorts to the tune of rs 100 crore without proper security. the loans were allegedly sanctioned in fictitious names. audit reports were tampered with and employees who refused to toe the line were allegedly threatened. it may be recalled that the tampering of the audit report had been detected by then managing director of the bank ajit sasanur, who had brought it to the notice of higher-ups in the cooperation department. he had also reported the illegal activities of the president and others to the joint registrar of cooperative societies and urged disciplinary action. shivakumargouda patil had sanctioned rs 2.61 crore to varada sugars in dombaramattur of haveri district, of which he was a director. the loan was sanctioned without proper security. the project never took off and there was no tangible asset to be attached to the bank. dharwad north mp vijay sankeshwar had complained to the reserve bank of india, which in turn directed nabard to enquire into the allegations. besides corruption, low recovery also ails the bank, which stopped refinance. the failing kharif crop hit the farming community, and nabard took up an enquiry into the irregularities. it found that bank officials could not make any headway in recovering loans from the strong and influential, and when they approached the small debtors, they had to face the ire of farmers hit hard by drought. nabard found the management guilty and informed the rbi accordingly. a public interest litigation is pending in court and shivakumargouda patil has obtained anticipatory bail. meanwhile, shivakumargouda managed to get elected as president again, with those opposed to him boycotting the elections. initially, political parties had raised a hue and cry against the bank president and have now taken to the streets, demanding action. they are pleading with the authorities to save the bank and the farming community. but the state government is turning a blind eye to the goings-on in a premier rural banking institute. what has shocked the customers of the bank is co-operation minister d k shivakumar's indifference to the developments. the minister who visited haveri on tuesday objected to the employees going on strike instead of talking of disciplinary action against the erring management. this has not gone well with the depositors.
