0,"Cong, NCP ministers clash in cabinet meeting","MUMBAI: The meeting of the state cabinet on Wednesday turned into a big fight event following a heated argument between Congress ministers Patangrao Kadam and Satish Chaturvedi and Digvijay Khanvilkar of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP).

The bone of contention was a recent notification which allows state-control on the fees and the admissions to private medical colleges across the state.

Industries minister, Mr Kadam who runs the Bharati Vidayapeeth medical and dental colleges said the notification was illegal and demanded its withdrawal. He was supported by Labour minister Satish Chaturvedi who controls the Priyadarshini engineering college and the Lokmanya Tilak engineering college in Nagpur and Mumbai respectively.

Mr Kadam argued that since the state government does not fund the college it should not have any say in the admission or the fee structure of the privately-run colleges.

The Congress minister said that despite his presence in the state government the authorities have the temerity to issue such a notification. ""Is this our government or is it run by the opposition,"" he is learnt to have said.

State health minister Digvijay Khanvilkar said that though the state does not finance the institutions run by Mr Kadam and Mr Chaturvedi, both are running the colleges on land given by the state on a long lease period.

Mr Khanvilkar said as these colleges are run on state land they are automatically partially funded and the state is empowered to intervene in the admission process.

Mr Khanvilakar''s argument only raised tempers in the cabinet hall with Mr Kadam raising strong objection. Mr Khanvilkar, however, was supported by other ministers belonging to the NCP, even as chief minister Sushilkumar Shinde made futile attempts to pull the curtains down on the debate.

Mr Khanvilkar also pointed out that proper procedures was not followed by the privately-run colleges. He said local students were denied admission to Mr Kadam''s college and preference in given to those from outside the state.

The entrance examination conducted by the Bharati Vidyapeeth for admissions to the medical course is also not full-proof. ""Marks are given in pencil and there is a possibility of change, whereas there cannot be any tampering with the marks scored in the common entrance test conducted by the state,"" Mr Khanvilkar said.

1,'YSR playing dirt politics',"HYDERABAD: Taking strong exception to Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader Y S Rajasekhara Reddy''s allegation that the government was allowing garbage dumping in the Autonagar yard without taking precautions, tourism minister T Srinivas Yadav alleged on Friday that the Congress was playing ""dirt'''' politics.

The minister told reporters that the government was making alternative arrangements to dump garbage at nine different places. Out of them, Gandhamguda and Adibhatla (Rangareddy) were identified suitable places, he said.

Yadav said everyday 2,200 MT of municipal solid waste (MSW) was generated in the city. The entire waste was disposed at the Autonagar dumping site as the operations at Gandhamguda were suspended on an AP Pollution Control Board (APPCB) order.

The entire 70-acre site in Autonagar was completely filled with garbage and the height of the dump ranges from 50 to 90 feet. Autonagar landfill receives 7.2 lakh MT of garbage in an year, he said.

Outlining the steps initiated by the government to clear the garbage, the minister said the government would set up a scientific landfill site at Gandhamguda with Rs 4.5 crore. The Selco power plant, when fully operational, would absorb 700 MT of MSW per day. The plant would be commissioned by the end of September.

Yadav said the land at Adibhatla would be handed over to RDF Power Projects after getting clearance from the APPCB. When this plant is commissioned, it would absorb another 700 tonnes of garbage, he added.

In a related development, mayor Teegala Krishna Reddy accused the CLP leader for raking up the issue of environmental hazards posed by the Autonagar yard for deriving political mileage.

On many occasions, the residents of Autonagar had demanded shifting of the garbage yard out of their area. The longstanding demand of the residents hit the headlines after Rajasekhara Reddy inspected the yard on Thursday.

The Congress leader had reportedly captured the attention of the public on the dismal conditions at Autonagar after he was photographed at the garbage yard with a handkerchief pressed to his nose.

""It was Congress who set up the garbage yard in Autonagar and started the problem.

They are politicising the issue,"" said Krishna Reddy.

According to the mayor, plans are afoot to slowly shift the garbage yard away from Autonagar.

He said 188 acres in Ibrahimpatnam has been handed over to the MCH for utilising it as a landfill. Further, 50 acres in Gandhamguda would soon be handed over to the MCH for extending the garbage yard.

2,Ayodhya: The BJP's theme for the elections?,"NEW DELHI: The public promise to build the Ram Temple at the ``birthplace'' of Ram in Ayodhya by the Prime Minister and deputy PM L K Advani on Friday, taken with the resolution that the BJP passed on Ayodhya at its recent national executive meeting in Raipur, is a clear indication that the issue is back on the party''s electoral agenda even if it is not on the NDA''s Agenda for Governance.

The statements made by the PM and the DPM were made while addressing mourners at the funeral of the late Ramjanmabhoomi Nyas chairman Mahant Ramchandra Paramhans on the banks of the Saryu in Ayodhya, a few kilometres away from the disputed spot on which the Babri Masjid once stood, and where the BJP and the sangh parivar would like a Ram Temple to be built.

Reports from Ayodhya said that the PM, while addressing the crowd, vowed that a grand Ram temple would be built at the Ramdhya Janamsthan: ``We would fulfil his (Mahant''s) last wish. We are confident that all obstacles would be removed and the path paved for it,'' he said, adding, ``Good sense will prevail even on those who are opposing it and, together we will fulfil his dream. We feel confident in front of his funeral pyre.'' And Advani added, `` Nobody will now be able to stop the mahant''s dream from being fulfilled now.''

Indeed, these statements go a step beyond the BJP resolution, which had promised to work towards a negotiated settlement of the Ayodhya problem, as the party was committed to building a Ram Temple.

4,Citu denies hand in unrest at port,"KOLKATA: Centre of Indian Trade Unions leader in charge of port workers, Hemlal Chatterjee, said on Friday that his organisation was in no way involved in the labour unrest which held up unloading of cargo at the Kolkata port on Wdenesday.

â€œA section of the press have deliberately blamed us for the incident, which we have, in fact, condemned.

The violence was committed by the Port Sramik Janata Panchayat set up by Noor Ahmed. Why are we being blamed,â€� Chatterjee asked.

The Citu leader said his organisation was in fact convincing the port workers that maintenance of peaceful industrial relations would guarantee an increase in cargo handling.

â€œThis, in turn, will benefit the workers as they will get more work. Any irresponsible act, like a wildcat strike, will only harm the workersâ€™ interests,â€� he said.

Condemning the incident in which a section of workers demanded money from an Indonesian ship carrying petroleum coke and held up mechanical handling of cargo for over 24 hours, Chatterjee said that the incident was the result of a business rivalry between two stevedore companies in which one hired the services of the Janata Panchayat to disturb the other.

â€œCitu is being falsely implicated in incidents of industrial violence,â€� Chatterjee and described this as a part of an overall campaign in favour of â€œde-unionisationâ€� in the state.

Unloading of petroleum coke from an Indonesian ship was held up for over 24 hours at Kolkata Port since Tuesday due to resistance from a section of contractual labourers.

Matters took an ugly turn on Thursday afternoon when mechanical unloading was about to begin.

The labourers refused to let payloaders and other equipment near the vessel docked at the Kolkata Dock System and clashed with police and other workers.

5,Water woes: TDP angry at govt,"NEW DELHI: The Telugu Desam Party (TDP) is upset over the Centreâ€™s indifference to the ongoing water dispute between Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. It believes that the BJP is being lenient towards Karnataka as the party has a political stake in that state while that is not the case with AP.

As an important ally of the ruling NDA, the TDP had expected that the Central leaders, including PM Vajpayee, would rush to admonish the Karnataka government for overdrawing its water and violating the inter-state agreements on irrigation projects. As it happens, its plea for Central intervention has fallen on deaf ears.

Last week, when AP chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu was in Delhi, he especially met Vajpayee in this connection and asked him to restrain Karnataka from overdrawing water. The PM merely assured him that justice would be done. However, there has been no follow-up action, said TDP MPs.

Similarly, when this issue was discussed in the Rajya Sabha this week, no assurances were held out to the AP members who had charged that Karnataka is depriving AP farmers of their legitimate share of water, resulting in drought-like conditions in several parts of the state.

6,NHRC appeal worries govt,"NEW DELHI: As a worried Gujarat home minister Amit Shah met Union law minister Arun Jaitley on Friday, the echo of NHRCâ€™s Special Leave Petition on the Best Bakery case is being felt in the law ministry.

Though officials are categorical that â€˜â€˜at this stage no legal opinion could be given to the state governmentâ€™â€™, they feel that if the Supreme Court admits the petition, it would â€˜â€˜open a Pandoraâ€™s box of revisiting communal cases where justice is perceived to be not doneâ€™â€™. Notwithstanding the legal blocks, which might come in the way of ordering retrial, officials feel it would be a â€˜â€˜historic legal landmarkâ€™â€™ both for the apex court and NHRC if the SLP is admitted.

â€˜â€˜Never before has a statutory body moved the apex court with a prayer to set aside a trial courtâ€™s judgment. It would herald a new chapter in our jurisprudence,â€™â€™ a senior official said. How? â€˜â€˜We have a history of communal riots. What would stop a victim from knocking on the SCâ€™s door in case he is not satisfied with the trial courtâ€™s judgment?â€™â€™ the official asks, referring to cases related to the 1984 anti-Sikh riots in Delhi.

The cases all saw Congress politicians acquitted in circumstances strikingly similar to the Gujarat cases. The official feels NHRC plea of seeking non-bailable warrants against all the accused in the Bakery case would be untenable.

7,NCM team's focus only on violence,"LUCKNOW: Readers of The Times of India, while extending their views on whether minor schoolchildren should be forcibly involved in agitations related to public issues, may have condemned the management of St Maryâ€™s School for exposing the young ones to violence and indiscipline instead of academic empowerment.

But none among the delegates from the National Commission for Minorities (NCM) and many a non-government organisation visiting the school campus on Friday afternoon appeared to buy the view. Their focus remained confined to the alleged police highhandedness during a protest on Monday morning.

Asked whether young students should be forcibly made to participate in â€˜rail rokoâ€™ agitations to protest against pathetic civic conditions, NMC member Renuka Dean curtly quipped that this was not in the ambit of her review. â€œI met those arrested by the police and languishing in jail on Thursday,â€� Renuka said, giving details of her four-point programme in the state capital adding that after meeting students and teachers of the school on Friday she visited the Jalalpur railway crossing, the site of the protest where violence erupted, to talk to the residents for a first-hand report. The third leg of her tour comprising meetings with the officials of the district administration and police on Saturday will be followed by an interaction with various religious organisations which had labelled principal of St Maryâ€™s School Father John Augustine as one who does not deserve priesthood anymore. Renuka Dean was clear on the focus of her visit stating that the delegation was here to look into the atrocities against the minorities and nothing more.

Interestingly, while the Friday visit of Renuka Dean was meant to ensure an interactive session with students and teachers when the school re-opened for the first day since the violence, the delegation arrived on the campus after 2:30 pm. By this time the 70-odd students, out of the total of some 600 enrolled with the school, who had dared to attend regular classes had left for the day. It took quite an effort for the school management to call a handful of students residing in the vicinity of the campus, who reluctantly replied to queries of the delegation. Fear was evident in the area which bore a deserted look as only a few parents came forward to be vocal on what all happened at Para on Monday. Charges of police highhandedness were repeatedly levelled as a pregnant woman alleged that even she was not spared by the lathi-wielding men in uniform. Others in the delegation included Raziya Noman, Meena Siddiqui, Geeta Sahu, Manju Trivedi, Ruby and Rajesh Singh of St Josephâ€™s Cathedral along with Adam and Narel Paul. Majority of the delegates were members of prominant activist groups and non-government organisations who were moved by the news reports of alleged police atrocities against schoolchildren and had come on a visit to the site.

8,Power employees warn government,"LUCKNOW: Strongly reacting to NTPC chairman CP Jain''s statement regarding the takeover of Kesco, the Vidyut Karamchari Sanyukt Sangharsh Samiti has warned the government of a backlash in case the contract between the government and the samiti is breached.

The distribution company is likely to be handed to the NTPC on October 1.

Referring to the April 29 agreement entered into between the samiti office -bearers and energy minister Ramveer Upadhyay, the sangharsh samiti has maintained that it is clearly specified that the government will consider the proposal put up by it regarding the management of the distribution company. ""But Jain''s statement indicated that the government was going ahead unilaterally to hand over the company to the NTPC.""

Prominent office-bearers like Shailendra Dubey, AK Singh and RS Rai stated that in accordance with the proposal submitted by it the cost for the purchase of power from the UPPCL had been pegged at Rs 1.64 per unit. Opposed to this was the rate of Rs 1.35 per unit proposed by the NTPC.

The centrally -run corporation had proposed that it would run the distribution company at a loss for five years and would reduce the line losses by 17 per cent. The samiti, on the other hand, had proposed that it would ensure that Kesco would begin earning a profit after a gap of two years and would reduce the line losses by 22 per cent.

The samiti has also raised strong objections to handing over of assets to the NTPC for a mere Rs 30 crore. The Kanpur-based company''s assets were to the tune of Rs 2000 crore.

10,Court refuses to stay Shahabuddin's arrest,"SIWAN: A local court here on Saturday refused to stay execution of arrest warrant against RJD MP Mohammed Shahabuddin and adjourned hearing on his anticipatory bail application till August 7 in a kidnapping case.

Siwan District and Sessions Judge Abhijit Sinha, while hearing the anticipatory bail plea of Shahabuddin, refused to entertain the prayer of his counsel Ishtdeo Tiwari to stay the execution of arrest warrant and asked the police to submit case diary on August 7 when the court will resume hearing.

Shahabuddin''s counsel had on Friday filed the anticipatory bail application following Wednesday''s order of state Director General of Police D P Ojha for his arrest in the case of the kidnapping and suspected murder of CPI-ML activist Munna Chaudhary in 2001.

A local court had on February 5, 2001 issued a non-bailable arrest warrant against Shahabuddin and five others for alleged kidnapping and suspected murder of Munna.

Chaudhary''s parents had alleged that their son was kidnapped and murdered for having dared to oppose the MP in the Lok Sabha Elections in 2000.

The MP got some reprieve on Friday when Siwan Chief Judicial Magistrate Sushil Kumar Sinha turned down a police prayer for attaching his property.

The CJM, while turning down the prayer of investigating officer in the case, Shivnath Chaudhary, for attachment of the MP''s property, had allowed the police to publish a written proclamation asking Shahabuddin to appear before the court in a month''s time from the date of issuing of such proclamation in accordance with Section 82 of the CrPC.

13,"Cong ready for simultaneous state, LS polls","KOLKATA: The Congress seems to be warming up to the Centre''s idea of holding Lok Sabha and Assembly elections in the country simultaneously.

Congress Working Committee member Pranab Mukherjee said in Kolkata on Saturday that his party was game to the idea as it would save the financially strapped Centre and state government''s a lot of money.

Aware that the attempt to arrive at a consensus on the issue might prompt the BJP-led NDA government to prepone the Lok Sabha polls slated for next year, Mukherjee said it was quite within the powers of the Prime Minister to recommend an early Lok Sabha poll.

""Going by the country''s records, the earlier Presidents always approved of such recommendations from the Prime Minister,"" Mukherjee said.

Mukherjee was reacting to deputy Prime Minister L K Advani''s comments that the Centre was holding informal discussions with NDA allies and the Election Commission members on synchronizing the Lok Sabha and the Assembly elections.

The veteran Congress leader agreed with Advani that political parties, remaining in a continuous election mode, could be a handicap for good governance as they feared to take unpopular but essential decisions during an election year.

""Till 1967 we had simultaneous Lok Sabha and Assembly polls in the country. Now we have elections throughout the year. This is indeed a huge burden on the government exchequer,"" Mukherjee observed.

15,BJP demands immediate arrest of Siwan MP,"PATNA: The Bihar DGP D P Ojha''s directive to the police to arrest Siwan RJD MP Mohammad Shahabuddin in connection with the kidnapping and subsequent murder of Munna Chaudhary two years back and his request to the government to hand over the investigation of Gopalganj regional rural bank dacoity case in March this year to the CBI has snowballed into a major controversy.

While a large number of RJD legislators have demanded immediate removal of Ojha, the BJP has come out strongly in support of the beleaguered DGP. A 10-member delegation of the party led by its state president Nand Kishore Yadav on Saturday submitted a memorandum to the governor M Rama Jois requesting him to ensure that the police executed the arrest warrant against Shahabuddin.

Accusing the controversial RJD MP of unleashing a reign of terror in Siwan, the delegation also requested Jois to summon the chief secretary and home secretary and direct them to ensure the compliance of Ojha''s order. It also urged the governor to call the DGP to get the details of various criminal cases pending against Shahabuddin.

The leader of opposition in the state assembly Sushil Kumar Modi, leader of opposition in the Legislative Council Ganga Prasad, three general secretaries of the party Chandra Mohan Roy, Baleshwar Singh Bharti and Kameshwar Chaupal, treasurer Awadhesh Narayan Singh and legislators Birkeshwar Prasad Singh, Raj Kishore Keshri and Rameshwar Prasad were the other members of the delegation.

The BJP will also submit a memo to the NHRC urging it to move the Supreme Court seeking re-trial of 14 cases, in which Shahabuddin had been acquitted for want of evidence, outside Bihar.

With regard to DGP''s missive to the home secretary requesting the government to order a CBI probe into Shahabuddin''s assets as well as Gopalganj rural bank dacoity in which the dacoits looted Rs 20 lakh from the bank, the BJP has requested Jois to direct the government to hand over the matter to the CBI besides asking it to move the Supreme Court to seek the re-trial of 14 cases involving Shahabuddin outside Bihar.

Talking to mediapersons Nand Kishore and Modi said that Jois had assured the delegation that he would take appropriate action within the constitutional framework.

Both of them charged the RJD government with searching for an excuse to remove Ojha. Modi said that the statements of RJD legislators demanding removal of Ojha was issued at the behest of RJD supremo Laloo Prasad Yadav. He said that the legislators were summoned at chief minister''s residence to put their signature on the statement. Modi said that even the lower judiciary officers were scared of Shahabuddin.

Modi said that the Shahabuddin issue was a test case for the police as far as tackling law and order was concerned. This case would decide whether the state government was serious about improving the law and order situation in the state, Modi added.

Charging Shahabuddin with issuing threats to the police officials who ventured to take action either against him or his henchmen, Modi said that the government had in the past transferred two Siwan SPs S K Singhal and B S Meena under former''s pressure.

He also referred to the attack at the Haroonnagar, Phulwarisharif, residence of Gopalganj SP Saheb Akhtar and the killing of a dozen political opponents of the Siwan MP which included the murder of son and servant of the Siwan district BJP president Ramakant Pathak and a former president of JNU Students'' Union Chandrasekhar.

16,Producers see red over 'high' canteen income,"BANGALORE: In yet another twist to the animosity between film producers and exhibitors in Karnataka, the producers association on Saturday pledged their support to a government crackdown on ""unauthorised"" income of canteens in theatres.

This is in retaliation to some theatres in North Karnataka not screening new Kannada releases on Friday.

Speaking to reporters here, producers association president Basanth Kumar Patil said: ""Canteens in film theatres charge much higher rates for snacks and drinks than the maximum retail price (MRP). We are extending our support to the department of legal metrology to crackdown on this.""

The producers met the legal metrology officers on Friday, after they imposed fines totalling Rs 21,000 on four theaters in Bangalore â€“ Nartaki, Santosh, Majestic and Kapali. ""We told them that these fines are pittance for the theatres, because each day about 5,000 people come to the theatres and if a canteen sells just 400 soft drinks a day, they will have raised Rs 3,000! In fact, the day after the raid, we found that the theatres continue to sell products at inflated rates,"" Patil alleged.

He has suggested that the legal metrology department should exhibit boards at every theatre about canteens adhering to MRP and offered to publicise the issue on their behalf. ""We said we will also tell the public about the issue whenever possible,"" he added.

17,Rival Youth Congress groups clash in Hyderabad,"HYDERABAD: The internal squabblings in the AP Youth Congress (APYC) came to the fore again on Saturday as rival groups clashed at the Gandhi Bhavan, the headquarters of the Congress party.

While one group was demanding the removal of APYC president Venkata Rao on charges of ''selling away'' party posts, the other was supporting his continuation in the post.

Earlier, the two central observers from Delhi sent by YC national president Randip Singh Surjewala to look into the allegations levelled against Venkata Rao were forced to ''flee'' from a private hotel as the two groups created a ruckus. The two observers, Vidya Bhushan Sharma and Anil Thomas, fled in an auto rickshaw from the hotel and asked the warring groups to be present at Gandhi Bhavan.

However, the two observers did not turn up at the party headquarters till evening. Meanwhile, activists of the dissident camp rushed to Gandhi Bhavan and started shouting slogans against Venkata Rao. Meanwhile, the supporters of Venkata Rao retaliated with counter slogans.

PCC treasurer D Vittal Rao tried to pacify the activists of the rival groups but in vain. The dissident group led by Rangareddy YC members B Kishan, Bajrang Sharma and others manhandled APYC general secretary B Krishna Murthy accusing him of collecting money from aspiring candidates and later ditching them.

After over one-and-half hours the police came in and dispersed the two groups. The dissident group members alleged that Venkata Rao was selling away the party posts to new entrants neglecting the activists who worked for strengthening the party at the grass-roots level.

However, Venkata Rao later speaking to reporters refuted the allegations and said that all the appointments into the Congress youth wing were made after the approval of the unit''s high command at Delhi. He alleged that a ''handful'' of activists, with the influence of external forces, were trying to malign his image and that of the party as well.

20,Hizbul warns of more suicide attacks,"SRINAGAR: The Pro-Pakistan militant outfit Hizbul Mujahideen on Saturday warned of intensifying suicide attacks within and outside Jammu and Kashmir and refused to acknowledge the ceasefire proposal of separatist amalgam Hurriyat Conference.

It is for the militant leadership to decide on the timing of calling off operations, the pro-Pakistan militant outfit''s spokesman Junaidul Islam told a local English daily in a telephonic interview.

""Ceasefire has its own time and political people cannot decide it. Only militant leadership knows how and when to announce a ceasefire,"" Islam said.

He said the outfit did not feel the necessity for a ceasefire for dialogue as talks could go on simultaneously.

Hurriyat Chairman Maulana Mohammad Abbas Ansari and newly-elected Amir(chief) of Jamaat-e-Islami had called for a ceasefire between militants and security forces to put an end to bloodshed in the state.

""If we feel that India is sincere in its approach (to resolve Kashmir issue), then we can think of it. However, at the moment, the Mujahids will intensify their operations against security forces, especially fidayeen (suicide) attacks and expand them to other parts of the country as well,"" he said.

""Hizb leadership has decided to carry out suicide attacks comprising Pakistani and Kashmiri militants in the coming days. Scores of deadly attacks will be carried out,"" he claimed.

Islam also said India and Pakistan cannot resolve the issue bilaterally and called for world powers, notably the US to intervene in resolving the dispute.

He parried a question on whether the outfit was involved in the attack on Akhnoor army camp recently and claimed that Hizb cadres were 5000-strong with ""negligible presence of foreign militants.""

Referring to the ceasefire announced by the slain Hizb leader Abdul Majid Dar, he said, ""we gave peace a chance a few years ago, but were forced to call if off because of the Indian attitude.""

25,GERC working on third party sale model for power,"AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat Energy Regulatory Commission (GERC) is trying to work out a model for the third party sale of captive power generation as has been mentioned in the Central Electricity Act 2003 but has not been provided for in the Gujarat Electricity Bill, GERC chairman Subba Rao has said.

â€œWe are consulting with various players from the power sector to arrive at a feasible model,â€� said Rao, who was speaking at an interactive session on The Electricity Act 2003, organised by the Electricity Consumersâ€™ Consultative Forum of Gujarat along with the Confederation of Indian Industry here on Saturday.

CII (Gujarat Council) chairman Piruz Khambatta pointed out the need for following up the act with a clearly enunciated electricity and tariff policy for large scale domestic and international participation. â€œA clear policy framework on open access, elimination of subsidy and success and condition for a second licensee is required,â€� Khambatta said.

According to CIIâ€™s senior energy advisor V Raghuraman, the act, which has been enacted recently by Parliament and is expected to be implemented by December 10, 2003, was a win-win one for the sector and would go a long way in cutting down mounting power losses and curbing theft and leakages.

â€œPower losses have mounted from Rs 3000 crore in the early nineties to Rs 36,000 crore in 2002 and theft, which constituted 26 per cent of the losses 10 years ago has gone up to 50-60 per cent,â€� he said.

IL&FSâ€™ power business group chief executive Ashok Harane called for the creation of a proper rural-urban divide for the successful implementation based on the learnings of the Orissa model Maharashtraâ€™s rural electrification experiments.

According to Ms C Baliga, principal executive officer, Tata Power Ltd, though the forthcoming act was a milestone beginning it was not a panacea for the ills already embedded in the basic structure of the present act.

28,"LS, assembly polls may be clubbed","NEW DELHI: The Vajpayee government wants assembly elections in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Delhi and Mizoram, slated for this year-end, to be deferred to January 2004 and hold the general elections along with them.

Though the tenure of the Vajpayee government will last till the end of 2004, the law ministry is holding informal consultations with the Election Commission on such a possibility. The Centre is justifying this by stating that a combined election will reduce the expenditure and it will be easier for the Election Commission to hold polls simultaneously.

There is also a possibility to hold assembly elections in Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra in January as well. These states are scheduled to go to polls later next year.

Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani told reporters on board special IAF aircraft en route to Pune on Saturday, â€˜â€˜the government is consulting the EC on holding these elections simultaneously in the first quarter of 2004.â€™â€™ Informal discussion has also been held with one of the major NDA allies, he added. Whether the EC will consider the governmentâ€™s proposal is not clear.

About the reaction of allies and Election Commission members to the proposal, he said, â€˜â€˜There is a lot of appreciation. Generally people agreeâ€™â€™. To a query whether it would be taken up formally, he said, â€˜â€˜first let it be decided by the governmentâ€™â€™.

It is learnt Prime Minister Vajpayee, Advani, law minister Arun Jaitley and BJP president M Venkaiah Naidu, who have discussed the matter several times, favour this proposal.

The BJP hopes to take advantage of this yearâ€™s good monsoon which is likely to give a bumper kharif crop.

It also favours a combined Lok Sabha and assembly elections because of the five states, four â€” MP, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and Delhi â€” are ruled by the Congress where anti-incumbency factor will add to its advantage.

In its Mumbai ''chintan baithak'' party leaders were of the opinion that if BJP did not perform well in these states in the year-end assembly elections, it will go against the party in

the general election. Sources said this was another reason why the party is now taking of a simultaneous election in January.
