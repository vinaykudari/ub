0,State suffers sharp drop in industrial investments: CII,"PUNE: Industrial investments in Maharashtra have suffered a sharp slowdown with investments in the state having dropped from Rs 10,000 crore in 1993-94 to barely Rs 65 crore in 2002-03.

While the number of sick units in Maharashtra have increased â€œmanifoldâ€�, new industrial projects in the state have reduced from 850 in 1993-94 to 32 in 2002-03, according to the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII).

The CII has expressed grave concern over this situation and has urged the government to â€œdeal with the situation urgentlyâ€�, CIIâ€™s western region chairman, Firdose A. Vandrevala, said here on Saturday.

He said the number of sick units have increased manifold in Maharashtra, while fiscal issues were also causing serious concern as government guarantees and balance-sheet borrowings have mounted to Rs 83,799 crore.

Speaking at a news conference, Vandrevala (managing director, Tata Power) said a CII delegation met chief minister Sushilkumar Shinde on June 2 and suggested the formation of an industry-government task force to promote economic revival in the state.

â€œThe CM asked us to pursue the matter with the chief secretary,â€� he said.

Vandrevala said the CII has commissioned an international consultancy to study the situation in the state and highlight the necessary steps to promote investments.

He said the CII has offered to work with the government in creating a â€œmodel villageâ€�, where the CII would help build industryfarmer-government linkages by providing financial guidance, marketing support and technology inputs.

The CII has recommended that the government give a boost to the manufacturing and service industries in the state, promote industrial and commercial development in secondary towns such as Nasik, Aurangabad, Nagpur, Ratnagiri and Kolhapur, and implement reforms in the power sector.

The CII has offered to work with the government in crop-specific initiatives in grapes and mango; in creating an international market for Asian films in Mumbai; and in promoting biotechnology, tourism and information technology.

About the national economy, he said, the CII expects the buoyancy in industry and services to continue and expects GDP growth of 6-6.4 per cent in 2003-04 as against 5 per cent last year. Vandrevala said there is a need for the development of an industrial policy in Goa, simplification of factory rules in Maharashtra and implementation of VAT (value added tax) across the country.

â€œWe feel that it is good governance and infrastructure development that will attract investments, and not policy sops,â€� he added.

The CII western region has decided on â€œcompetitiveness for growthâ€� as its annual theme and will help facilitate good governance in states. In Gujarat, the CII will work with the government for the development of IT and BT (biotechnology) policies, among other areas.

1,Government able to control price increase,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Kerala Food and Civil Supplies Minister,G Karthikeyan on Saturday claimed that UDF government was able to check and control price rise of essential commodites in the open market through effective government intervention.

This was mainly due to the presence of fare price shops, the ""Maveli stores"", run by civil supplies corporation in almost all parts of the state, he said while participating at a meet the minister programme on completion of two-year rule of UDF government.

Presently 835 Maveli stores were functioning in the state and within two years mavelie stores would be opened in all panchayats, he said, adding 208 panchayats did not have mavelie stores now. The total sales turnover of the maveli stores was rs.172.31 crores last year.

2,All-party agreement on women's Bill must: Joshi,"PUNE: Lok Sabha speaker Manohar Joshi on Friday called for an all-party agreement on the womenâ€™s reservation Bill. He said he had convened a meeting to the effect on June 16. Joshi was speaking at a function to discuss womenâ€™s empowerment, organised by the Stree Aadhar Kendra.

Joshi said prime minister A.B. Vajpayee and Union health minister Sushma Swaraj were very keen on getting the Bill passed, but the criticism it drew from a number of political parties had deferred the discussion on it.

The Bill provides 33 per cent reservation to women in the Lok Sabha and state assemblies.

Joshi said women could progress only if they attained economic independence. â€œWhether it is the watch company HMT or sewing machines, providing employment to women is important to empower them and solve their problems,â€� he said.

Lauding womenâ€™s selfhelp groups and bachat dals (savings groups), he said, â€œThere is no limit to what a woman can achieve.

This is why it is important that they unite and strive for their progress.â€�

Joshi asked women to vote only for those politicians who help them. â€œWomen should decide who should run the nation. Donâ€™t vote for those who donâ€™t listen to you,â€� he said.

3,Liquor barons influencing Karnataka politics: George,"MYSORE: Samata Party national president George Fernandes on Saturday urged party leaders in Karnataka to steer the party clear of the liquor lobby and build it on a strong ideological foundation.

Addressing party office-bearers here, the defence minister was critical of political parties and their leaders in Karnataka and alleged that every party was being influenced by liquor barons. â€œI am pained to say that liquor barons have a great role to play in Karnataka politics and I do not want to build my party in the state with the support of liquor barons,â€� he said. He urged party leaders not to follow other parties in the state which failed to grow independently on their own ideological background.

Reacting to the plea from a section of party leaders in Karnataka on the party searching for electoral alliances, he said it was too premature to talk about possible allies in Karnataka. Instead of discussing the issue of alliance it was better for party workers to think about building the party and spreading its base.

Union minister Srinivas Prasad, who is also member of the party, told the party leadership to guide local leaders on finding alliance partners to face the Congress in Karnataka in future polls.

â€œThe BJP in Karnataka has lost its support base over the last three-and-half years and it doesnâ€™t have the support of even 5% of the electorate who stood by it in the previous election,â€� he said.

He said despite the disunity among Janata Parivar leaders, each faction had its own support base which was also the case in Karnataka. â€œWhile the JD(S) has support base and limitations, AIJD is a bunch of confused leaders,â€� he said, indicating how it would help the party forge a viable partnership with a JD faction, independent of partyâ€™s presence in the NDA.

4,"Formula for catching votes, winning polls","NEW DELHI: The Congress has never been out of power this long. In the past four years, the party could hardly reconcile itself to playing an effective Opposition, but as the elections draw near, it seems to have perked up and is working out an effective political strategy to recapture power. ""We are gearing up for the 2004 polls.

The election machinery has been galvanised,"" says senior Congressman Manishankar Aiyar. According to CWC member Salman Khurshid, various committees are at work on documents which will all go into devising an effective election strategy. The economic cell has been beefed up with the inclusion of Arjun Sengupta. A document on the 50 failures of the NDA government and chargesheets on non-Congress state governments have been prepared.

Election strategy committee: A ten-member Election Strategy Committee headed by Dr Manmohan Singh is busy working out winning stratagems.

Membership drive: An aggressive membership drive is on. The party hopes to enrol over a crore active members and 3.5 crore primary members. Even through Internet.

Pre-emptive strike: With drought set to provide fodder to the political parties to score points ahead of the elections, Sonia made a pre-emptive strike with her letter to the PM demanding timely steps. This deft political move, analysts say, could pay electoral dividends. The party plans to fight the anti-incumbency by attacking the BJP-led NDA governmentâ€™s discriminatory attitude towards Congress states particularly on the drought issue.

Good governance Vs misrule: The Congress also plans to contrast the good governance of Congress-ruled states with the BJPâ€™s misrule. According to Ahmed Patel, the BJP was in power in Delhi for five years. They changed three chief ministers. The party is now in power at the Centre but their state leadership has failed to persuade them to solve the problems of the Delhiites.

Secular alternative: The partyâ€™s flip flop on secularism didnâ€™t work in Gujarat. So will it soft Hindutva yet again? Aiyar says: ""We must take a clear unambiguous secular line and provide the electorate a secular alternative.""

The coalition question: Is an electoral tie-up with the SP on the anvil? Congressmen say coalitions are part of the Congress culture but the decision of whom to align with will be left to partyâ€™s state units. As of now, nothing is ruled out or ruled in, they say.

5,BJP slams govt for 'inaction',"HYDERABAD: The state unit of the BJP slammed the government and police for its â€œindifferent attitudeâ€� in tackling rioters who attacked and ransacked properties on Friday.

Addressing a press meet on Saturday, BJP floor leader in the assembly, N Indrasena Reddy, alleged that the police failed to take preventive measures following Thursdayâ€™s events despite apprehensions of violence in view of Friday prayers. He urged the government to take action against an MIM legislator who was openly supporting the people involved in violence on Friday.

The MIM MLA freed rioters who were arrested by deputy police commissioner C V Anand, he said. â€œPolice machinery failed to stop attacks on properties of one community and religious places, including Digambar Jain and Hanuman temples at Aghapura,â€� he said. He criticised Chandrababu Naidu for visiting the house of MIM leader Mohammed Ghouse â€” who was killed on Thursday â€” but not visiting the places of worship that were attacked.

â€œBoth the places are a stones throw away from each other and we waited for the him to visit the temples for four hours,â€� he said. This would create a feeling that the government is adopting a â€œpartisanâ€� approach on the issue, he said. The BJP leader said that the police were terrorising the people of Mangerbasti and trying to evict them from their houses in the name of arresting those involved in Thursdayâ€™s incidents.

6,State to warn ministers about power abuse,"MUMBAI: The Maharashtra government has decided to comply with the recommendations made by Lok Ayukta V.P. Tipnis in his report on the role of two ministers in protecting illegal settlers on a Vakola plot earmarked for a school.

Mr Tipnis had passed strictures against housing minister Syed Ahmed and minister of state for home (rural) Kripashankar Singh, both of the Congress. The report indicted Mr Ahmed and Mr Singh for â€œabusing their official positionâ€™â€™ and â€œunjustly favouring the encroachersâ€™â€™.

â€œThe Lok Ayukta has not recommended the dismissal of the two ministers, but has asked the government to warn them,â€™â€™ an official in the chief ministerâ€™s office told TNN on Saturday.

However, Narayan Rane, leader of the opposition and former chief minister, said that he was not satisfied with the governmentâ€™s response.

â€œWe insist that Mr Ahmed and Mr Singh be dismissed from the ministry,â€™â€™ he said. â€œIt is not the first case where Mr Singh has been accused of favouring encroachers. Earlier, he had given protection to those who had encroached on airport land in Santa Cruz.â€™â€™

Mr Rane said that by supporting illegal activities, Mr Ahmed and Mr Singh had violated their oath of office.

The case involves a stateowned plot that in 1990 was allotted to the Hind Seva Parishad trust for the construction of a womenâ€™s college.

Shishir Shinde claimed that the security staff of the clothing chain threw stones at his men first.

It is learnt that the Mulund unit of the Shiv Sena plans to renew the agitation if retail outlets in the area fail to offer more jobs to local Maharashtrian youths by August 30.

8,"Promotion delayed, PCS officer threatens suicide","CHANDIGARH: Senior PCS officer posted as additional deputy commissioner in Moga district has threatened self-immolation if he is not promoted to IAS cadre before his day of superannuation on June 30.

In a letter addressed to the chief secretary, 1984 batch PCS officer HL Kumar has categorically stated that the delaying tactics of the state government have forced him to take this extreme step.

Kumar along with seven others had been selected by the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) way back in November 2002 but the government has failed to issue notification.

In fact, no promotion from PCS has been effected since March 1997 though the selections for promotions should be held annually to fill all the fresh vacancies in the promotion quota. What have compounded the agony of Kumar are few tragedies in his personal life. Kumar said, â€˜â€˜I lost my 27-year-old married daughter in 1999 and my wife died six months later and soon after my sister expired too.

And now I am deprived of my hard earned promotion, which is yet another tragedy.â€™â€™ â€˜â€˜I had written to the chief secretary a fortnight ago to highlight my plight and level of frustration but it was of no avail,â€™â€™ rued Kumar.

All these have increased his frustration which, he said, was driving him to take his own life. Sources point out that such vacancies to be filled by promotion were permitted to be accumulated to ensure that the very junior officers, who were favourites of the then powers that be, come in the zone of consideration. For instance, for eight posts in 2000, 24 officers came in the zone of consideration but incidentally some â€˜â€˜favouritesâ€™â€™ failed to make it to IAS and the entire selection was stalled. Despite the UPSC directions, couple of review meetings and directives of the CAT and high court and the apex court, said Kumar, the government has not honoured the selection of the UPSC panel- comprising four representatives of Punjab government, one of the Union government and one UPSC member.

Now, three more vacancies have occurred yet the government is not anxious to hold selection so that the number of vacancies increase to enlarge the zone of consideration to ensure that the â€˜â€˜favouritesâ€™â€™ too fall in the zone of consideration. The others who were selected along with Kumar are Hans Raj Gangar, Arvinder Singh, Som Nath, Amrita Atwal, RL Mehta, Megh Raj and GR Bansal. Som Nath retired in October last year without getting the promotion while Atwal and Gangar would attain the age of superannuation within a year. Atwal is widow of Punjab police DIG, who was killed by terrorists at the gate of the Golden Temple.

9,Saathi's arrest may be taken up with Naidu,"AHMEDABAD: The arrest of Deepak Patel alias Saathi, the BJP MP from Anand, in connection with multi-crore Charotar Nagrik Co-operative Bank scam is likely to be discussed during the party president Venkaiah Naiduâ€™s visit to Gujarat on Sunday.

The arrest has caused ripples in the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and a majority of the party leaders have urged state unit chief Rajendrasinh Rana to take up the issue with the Central leadership for punitive action against Patel.

Rana, who was in his constituency of Bhavnagar when the arrest was made, has already discussed the issue with state-level leaders who felt the incident had tarnished the image of the party.

In fact, this is not the first cooperative bank scam which has left the state BJP with egg on the face. Former chairman of the state- owned Gujarat Alkalies & Chemicals Limited (GACL) CR Patil, a prominent leader from South Gujarat, had earlier been arrested in connection with irregularities in the Diamond Jubilee Co-operative Bank of Surat. He is still behind bars.

When contacted, Rana said the arrest of the party MP was a serious matter and he had apprised party president Venkaiah Naidu about it.

10,Development to be main plank of NDA,"NIRMALI, Supaul: Prime Minister Vajpayeeâ€™s speech at Nirmali on Friday indicated that development would be the main plank of NDA campaign in the next Lok Sabha (LS) polls due next year and that he was trying to push the NDA constituents into the election mode.

Vajpayeeâ€™s announcement that Maithili would be included in the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution was clearly aimed at getting electoral mileage in the LS polls. Inclusion of Maithili in the Eighth Schedule had been a long-pending demand of the Mithilanchal people.

The PM not only stressed on development issues, including the need for improving road network in the state, but also appeared inclined to compensate Bihar for the loss of mineral-rich areas going to Jharkhand after its bifurcation in November 2000. Laying emphasis on the construction of roads, Vajpayee said the distance by road between far flung places had to be shortened at any cost.

He said Bihar had already got a few major Central projects while more such projects were in the offing. The huge turnout of people at the Nirmali college ground, where Vajpayee laid the foundation stone of Rs 323-crore Koshi mega railway bridge, must have strengthened his view that development was still a major issue with the people, particularly those living below the poverty line.

The model of the bridge put on display at Nirmali station seemed to have generated a lot of interest among the people. Aware of the devastation caused by the Koshi year after year and the pressure being put by the state government on the Centre to solve the perennial flood problem of North Bihar, Vajpayee said the Union government was holding talks with the Nepal government to tackle the destruction caused by the rivers originating in Nepal. Bihar had been facing either floods or drought for the last several years. Fund was not at all a problem.

â€œEvery family should have a means of livelihood before an Indian lands on the moon.â€� He also laid emphasis on the monitoring of development works, adding that development issues should not be politicised. The presence of Samata Party president and defence minister George Fernandes and JD(U) president and Union food minister Sharad Yadav at the function was meant to show the unity of NDA to the people even though the cold war between Kumar and Fernandes has become an open secret.

The presence of state BJP president Nand Kishore Yadav and leader of the opposition in the state assembly Sushil Kumar Modi at the function suggested that Vajpayee did not want the NDA constituents to fight among themselves. A few senior BJP leaders, including Giriraj Singh, had earlier criticised Kumar for not inviting Nand Kishore and Modi to the Nirmali function.

11,Penny-pinching state govt tells drought-hit to fend for themselves,"RAJKOT: Much before the advent of monsoon, district administrations in Saurashtra have begun shutting down drought relief works, ostensibly because the state government is feeling the cash crunch.

For instance, there were 323 relief works going on in Rajkot district till last week. Today, the number has come down to 293. â€œAt some places, the work was stopped because of some irregularities. In many cases, workers have started gearing up for the monsoon and have left. And some works were closed because they were over,â€� says a senior official. While officials say that this is routineâ€™, many believe that the cash-strapped government is cutting down on expenses. In fact, it is now alleged that in constituencies represented by opposition MLAs,works are wound up at the drop of a hat. Says Dr Dahyabhai J Patel, president of Rajkot district panchayat, â€œThe whole policy is dubious. At several places,work has been stopped in spite of the fact that there was a demand. Though the drought is worse than last year, the amount spent this year is much less than what was spent last yearâ€�. The administration has so far paid about Rs 11 crore in wages in drought relief works this year. The figure crossed Rs 17 crore last year.

The situation is similar in other districts like Jamnagar and Amreli. In Jamnagar, around 1,20,396 workers earned a living from 321 relief sites in the 10 scarcity-hit talukas till last week.

At present, however,work is on at 317 sites even though the drought and drinking water situation has worsened. â€œEvery week, new works are started and a few are closed down. So there is nothing unnatural,â€� says a Jamnagar district administration source. Of the 11 talukas of Amreli, as many of seven have been declared scarcity and semi-scarcity hit. In the course of the last few days, the number of relief work sites is down to just over 30 from 45. â€œOf these, nearly 15 works which have been closed,we found irregularities at three to four sites,â€� says Yunus Munshi, deputy DDO, Amreli. Also, there are districts like Bhavnagar, which may not have been declared scarcity-hit but does have some pockets where the situation is grim. â€œThere is not single relief work going on in Bhavnagar. It is sad because villages in the Bhal area are in a bad shape. Many of them have been demanding that relief work should be started. Besides, there a feeling among people that more works are being stopped in areas where the MLA is not from the ruling party,â€� says Shaktisinh Gohil, a Congress leader. However, Bhavnagar DDO Mona Khandar says, â€œThough there is no relief work site, we have started works under the Swarna Jayanti Rojgar Yojana at places where the situation was bad.â€�

Gohil argues that the primary reason for stalling relief works so early is that the government has no money. â€œBesides closing down many sites for the season,we have had complaints that work has been stopped for two weeks at places where even 10 per cent of people were absent on the day of the inspection. This is inhuman. The work has to go on even if there are 50 people and it has go on till there is adequate rainfall,â€� he says.

Surendranagar district, perhaps the worst-hit, is one of the few regions where the number of relief work sites has gone up. Penny-pinching state govt tells drought-hit to fend for themselves

12,Rudy assails Rabri govt's attitude to development,"PATNA: Minister of state for civil aviation (independent charge) Rajiv Pratap Rudy here on Saturday said that Bihar had reached a ""pre-civilisation stage"" as security has become primary concern of people as a result of which the development of the state has been hampered.

Rudy was here for the first time after becoming the minister of state for civil aviation (independent charge). Senior BJP leaders, including state BJP president Nandkishore Yadav and leader of the opposition Sushil Kumar Modi, welcomed him at the Patna airport. He held a press conference with them at the state BJP office in the afternoon. Rudy said that he would review the blue-print for civil aviation created by former civil aviation minister Shahnawaz Hussain, and would carry forward the work on principles set by him.

""Some changes are likely,"" he said. He promised transparency in the functioning of the civil aviation department, and also said that at present there was no proposal for disinvestment in Air India and the Indian Airlines. Rudy, who as minister of state for commerce, had contributed his mite to catalysing establishment of export based industries, is not satisfied with the approach of the Bihar government. According to him, now that his ministry had been changed, he was not in any position to do much for furthering the cause of trade and commerce in the state, particularly in establishing export based industries.

He said that the state government had maintained apathetic attitude towards development. Among those present in the press conference were senior BJP leaders, including Yadav, Modi, Ganga Prasad and Kiran Ghai. They lashed out against the state government ""for its not non-cooperation in implementing various development schemes sanctioned by the central government"".

Rudy charged the state government of not signing the memorandum of understanding (MoU) to kick-start the construction of Rs 387-crore Sheetalpur power grid, which is to be executed by Powergrid Corporation of India. The Sheetalpur grid falls in his Chapra parliamentary constituency. Rudy said that the project would benefit a lot of people in his constituency and surrounding areas.

14,Drug fugitive used high links in govt,"KOLKATA: The fugitive drugrunner S.N. Thanga had high connections with politicians and government officials, besides underworld dons in the North-eastern states.

He was bailed out twice by a customs superintendent and a Lieutenant-Colonel after being booked under the wildlife protection Act and the Arms Act, Narcotics Control Bureau detectives have learnt. Thanga was about to start manufacturing ATS at the ground floor of the Salt Lake residence of former CBI additional director general U.N. Biswas.

He used to operate transborder smuggling of rhinohorns and firearms, NCB sources said. But in both the cases, he came out of the police dragnet easily.

Thanga became an automatic choice for the Chinese drug cartel because of his connections. He was handpicked by druglord Kin Cheung Wang, better known as Mr 125 in the drug cartel.

Wang, who weighs 125 kg, had been running a drug ring covering the USA, Myanmar, Canada, India and China. He was arrested in China after a 20-month-long joint operation by the drug enforcement agencies of the USA and China.

NCB officers arrested two more persons in Chennai after the recovery of 500 kg ephedrine hydrochloride, the main ingredient for ATS.

Meanwhile, the detectives carried out raids at China Town in east Kolkata following the drug trail.

16,"BJP ministers get closeted, discuss situation","LUCKNOW: The BJP was suddenly abuzz with political activity here on Saturday when its nearly two dozen BJP ministers put their heads together to discuss, among other things, the present political situation created by the opposition unity in Uttar Pradesh.

In the absence of chief minister Mayawati, who is away on tour abroad, the BJP is saddled with the responsibility of defensive reinforcement of the coalition government, dislodging of which is an immediate object behind the opposition unity.

Four major pillars of this unity are the Samajwadi Party, the Rashtriya Kranti Party, the Congress and the Rashtriya Lok Dal, which withdrew its support from Mayawati-led BSP-BJP coalition government. These parties are likely to hold their crucial meeting later this month.

The meeting of BJP ministers, though viewed as significant, was described as a routine affair by leader of the BJP legislature party and urban development minister Lalji Tandon. The meeting was attended, among others, by senior including Om Prakash Singh (irrigation), Hukum Singh (agriculture) and Tandon himself, who presided over it.

Although it was a closed-door meeting stretching over three hours, it was believed to have discussed the emerging political situation and the challenge thrown by the opposition unity. Within political circles, the opposition unity is described as a serious challenge. â€œThe opposition may or may not be able to form an alternative government, but it certainly seems to be better placed to dislodge the government,â€� felt an independent observer. And this is not without reason.

The government has only a marginal majority of around nine members with its total strength 211 as against the requisite number of 202 in a House of 403. The government has an advantage of nine independents. But, notwithstanding the reiteration of their open support to the government, they are also believed to be on a slippery ground and can become a tool for change in the political situation. But, dismissing any threat to the government, Tandon said: â€œThe political situation is bound to change in favour of the ruling coalition in the state.â€�

While refusing to elaborate, he quipped: â€œDo not ask this question to me but from the Rashtriya Lok Dal, which has virtually imprisoned its legislators.â€� â€œThe government is pretty comfortable and any talk of threat to it is like a day dream for the prophets of doom,â€� Tandon said confidently. When asked about cabinet expansion, he said there was no question of expansion, but yes there was need to fill at least seven vacancies created by the resignation of the five RLD and two BJP ministers. But he refused to specify the timeframe for it. As for the meeting, he said this was a routine party meeting and emphasis had also been laid on it by BJP president Venkaiah Naidu for better coordination among, and self-appraisal by party ministers.

He said he was floating a new party Lok Dal (Charan). Singh said he did not approve of Ajit Singhâ€™s decision to withdraw support from the Mayawati government. Singh, who was a close associate of Charan Singh, was talking to newsmen, said that he was pained at the attitude of Ajit Singh, who had brought in the state cabinet a novice like Anuradha Choudhary against the wishes of RLD leaders.

Singh said that many MLAs of the RLD were critical of Ajit Singh but were not willing to take the risk at this moment. Ajit Singh should not have supported the demand of a Telangana state while he was a minister, he said.

Ajit Singh was a known party hopper who had never contested two elections on the same symbol, he added. He said that the Mayawati government enjoyed majority support in the House and there was no threat to it, adding that he would also ask Ajit Singh to quit the RLD and join the new outfit.

21,'NC running out of issues against Mufti govt',"SRINAGAR: Opposition National Conference has been reduced to merely criticising the language of ruling coalition members and ministers during the ongoing budget session of the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly as it seems to have run out of issues to attack the government.

While presenting the annual budget for 2003-2004 earlier this week, Finance Minister Muzaffar Hussain Beigh had at length discussed the shortcomings of the budgets presented by the previous National Conference governments.

Rising to the occasion, former finance minister and senior Opposition leader Abdul Rahim Rather spent most of the over one hour during the discussion on this year''s budget defending himself and his party.

A diversionary tactic adopted by the ruling PDP-Congress combine which worked to perfection as rather was left with little time to find flaws in Beigh''s proposals.

And when Rather did criticise the budget, it was in the meekest form and observers feel that it was more of admiration for the first zero deficit proposal for past 13 years than criticism that could have put the government on the backfoot.

Rather could not help but wish good luck to the coalition government in fulfilling the objectives of the budget.

Leader of Opposition in the Assembly Ghulam Mohiuddin Shah kept on harping that he was not opposing the budget for the sake of opposition but actually had nothing concrete in his suggestions.

Shah criticised the proposal to shift the Rs 1200 overdraft from the Jammu and Kashmir Bank to Reserve Bank of India as it would mean making the state government subservient to the RBI in financial terms.

""Though I admit that RBI will be giving you loans at half the interest rate charged by Jammu and Kashmir Bank, they will make you wriggle and writhe for money when you need it the most,"" he said.

Jammu and Kashmir''s debt servicing is an enormous Rs 550 crore a year, considering that the total plan has just been increased this year to Rs 2500 crore.

Shah also suggested that if the authority to impose taxes and custom duty on imports was restored to the state, Jammu and Kashmir would not need to rely on loans and too much of grants.

This suggestion seems to be very appealing to the mind as it would yet another step towards fiscal autonomy -- a policy adopted by the coalition government -- but needs an amendment to the country''s constitution in the Parliament where J and K has just six elected members, not enough to bring about the necessary change.

A former MP and an Opposition MLA seems to be busy correcting the grammatical mistakes of the ruling combine members and ministers -- be it in Urdu or English -- besides raising questions about his constituency.

When a ruling coalition MLA was expressing his opinion on the budget -- obviously in its support, the Opposition members interrupted him umpteen number of times to correct his Urdu -- whether ''ka'' or ''ki'' was more appropriate to be used in particular sentence or whether he recited a certain verse of poetry correctly.

The Opposition even tried to criticise the coalition government for failing to correct the wrongs of the past regime within seven months of assuming power only to be pushed on the backfoot by the ruling combine with its performance which might not be satisfactory for most but is moving in the right direction.

The issue of political prisoners and human rights violations has become the buzz word for the Opposition, probably not realising that most of arrests and alleged abuses took place during their rule.

Though there has been a substantial drop in allegations, but the government needs to do more if it wants to leave the Opposition with fewer issues in the House.

The government has not hesitated in translating into reality the good policies and steps that had remained on papers during the six-year NC rule.

The beautification drive, appointment of militancy affected victims in government jobs and opening of university campuses in other districts are a just few promises made by the NC government but implemented by the present dispensation.

The coalition might be drawing plaudits from all quarters, especially the masses, but it has to face criticism from its constituents who also have high expectations and are not ready even to accept glitches that were ''run of the mill'' till 2002.

Even PDP President Mehbooba Mufti has warned the government against complacency and asked it to maintain the momentum that was created when the coalition government took over in November 2002.

She asked the government to take effective measures to curb corruption in the state which has started raising its head again after a lull of nearly three months.
