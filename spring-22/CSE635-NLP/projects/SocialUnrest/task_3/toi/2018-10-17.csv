0,HC clears decks for BCC polls,"bangalore: the karnataka high court on tuesday cleared decks for holding of the forthcoming elections to the bangalore city corporation (bcc) and directed that the election process shall continue. a division bench comprising justices h l dattu and a v sreenivasa reddy issued notices to the state government, bcc and the state election commission on a batch of writ petitions filed by r a ashok kumar and other voters of the city challenging the validity of the government notification prescribing the quota for seats in favour of sc/st, women and backward classes for the 100 wards for which elections have been notified. the bench had however, declined to grant any stay order in respect of the notification. instead, the court said, ""the election process shall go on and the elections held will be subject to the results of the writ petitions."" the main grievance of the petitioners is that the quota of the reservation of seats in favour of sc/st, women and backward classes as prescribed under article 243 of the constitution had to be made by legislation by framing rulesunder the karnataka municipal corporations act. ""but the quota had been prescribed by the government with political ends in view and the reservations are illegal and arbitrary,"" they contended. the notification had been published on october 10, 2001, without publishing the draft earlier and thereby depriving the public the opportunity to put forth their grievances. the ""notification being null and void is liable to be struck down by the court,"" contended the petitioners.

2,Tumkur bandh against firing 'near total',"tumkur: the bandh called by both factions of janata dal, farmers organisations, cpi, cpm, dyfi and dss on monday against the police firing in channapatna was 'near total'. farmers later congregated before the deputy commissioner's office, where two former jd (s) ministers addressed the gathering demanding action against the guilty and protesting the government's stance on extraction of neera. former minister b. satyanarayana ridiculed the district incharge minister andcalled him a 'coconut mite minister' for failure to prevent the disease from ruining coconut trees. ""the government does not provide pesticides, nor does it allow the farmers to earn their livelihood by extracting neera,"" he charged. another former minister d. nagarajaiah, and suresh babu, mla, also spoke. kabaddi tournament: the three-day state-level kabaddi tournament to be held here from thursday has run into problems, said official sources. they said officials boycotted the tournament meeting as it was not adequately represented, resulting in its postponement. many didn't turn up even for the next meeting as they were not informed. the invitation card apparently was the bone of contention as it contained the name of a municipal councillor, which some officials objected to. their grouse: he does not represent the area where tournament is being held. all hurdles have been cleared, yet it is feared the rain could play spoilsport.

5,HC asks panel to hold municipal polls,"patna: the patna high court on tuesday directed the state election commission (sec) to hold municipal polls in bihar immediately in accordance with the provisions of the constitution. a division bench comprising chief justice r s dhavan and justice s k singh directed the sec to hold the municipal polls within six months from august 30, 2001. on this date the state government had notified constitution of nagar panchayats, municipal councils and municipal corporations in bihar. the court maintained that the sec must adhere to the provisions under article 243(q) of the constitution, which mandates holding of municipal elections within six months from the notification of municipal bodies. the sec's counsel submitted before the court that the municipal polls would be held in april next year. the state government's plea was that it has done its job of notifying the municipal bodies and that the ball is now in the sec's court so far as holding of the elections is concerned. on this the petitioner's lawyer, m p gupta, argued that the municipal polls are urgently needed by december so that the elected municipal bodies can be given grants from the supplementary budget of the state. the court observed that the municipal bodies should not lose such grants and so early municipal polls are important. it said the panchayat polls were conducted on the intervention of court and now the municipal elections will be held after a long time on court's order. proceedings quashed: the same bench quashed the proceedings of the court of chief judicial magistrate of vaishali in which the district magistrate was made one of the accused in the case relating to alleged irregularities committed in the vaishali collectorate. the high court had earlier dismissed the writ petition of bihar dalit vikas manch, asking the petitioner to file an fir if irregularities have been committed in the collectorate. on this the petitioner filed a complaint case in the court of vaishali cjm. on tuesday, the vaishali dm moved the high court, submitting that he was made a party in the case while he was himself supposed to inquire into the alleged irregularities. the high court then quashed the proceedings against the dm pending in the cjm's court.

6,Light punishment for errant principals,"kolkata: in a shocking display of leniency, the west bengal board of secondary education has let off 65 'corrupt' principals of secondary schools, with a light rap. the 65 headmasters, 25 of whom are from the city and the rest from districts, allegedly took bribes from students who had failed in class ix and admitted them to class x in their schools. instead of taking stringent action, the board decided that the annual increment of these headmasters might be stopped by way of punishment. the board apparently is wary of the teachers' unions. president of the board, haraprasad samaddar said, though we understand the necessity of harsher punishment like suspension, for such errant teachers, it is not easy to suddenly decide on such punishment before consulting the different teachers' organisations. this will soon be done. samaddar did admit that the issue was serious. a student who has failed in class ix cannot take the madhyamik examination the same year. if any student does this with the connivance of a headmaster, it is tantamount to cheating. educationists are shocked at this lenient view taken by the board. if the charges are proved against them, such erring headmasters deserve much harsher punishment — after all, they are expected to be incorruptible! said former visva-bharati vice-chancellor and eminent historian nemai sadhan bose. the matter first came to the board's notice when a public interest litigation was filed in the calcutta high court early this year by some guardians complaining that four students of rahara ramakrishna mission who had failed in class ix had taken admission in class x in a school at titagarh. after investigation, it was proved that the headmaster of the school had taken at least rs 3,500 per student. expressing its displeasure, the high court asked us to find out if this had become a practice, said board secretary pradyut haldar. he admitted that it was the faulty registration system which gave students a chance to cheat the board, and so we are changing the registration system. according to the existing system, on promotion to class ix, students are given a registration number that remains unchanged up to the madhyamik exam. even if they change their school, their number remained unchanged. from now, as soon as any student decides to change school, the registration number will be changed. a circular to this effect will soon be sent out, halder said. checking the registration numbers of class ix and x students all over the state, the board found that there were a few hundred students who failed in class ix, took a transfer certificate from the school and then took admission in class x in another after bribing the authorities of that school. all such students identified in course of the probe are being sent back to class ix.

9,Contaminated water for govt hospital patients,"hyderabad:absence of proper drinking water facility is forcing the patients and their relatives at government hospitals in the city to consume contaminated water, thus exposing them to health hazards. though the hyderabad metropolitan water supply and sewerage board is supplying regular drinking water to both osmania and gandhi hospitals, the authorities are, in turn, storing the water in overhead tanks. hospital staffers says that the tanks seldom get cleaned leading to algae bloom. according to a staffer of osmania general hospital, the overhead tanks in the hospital were cleaned three months back. similarly, at gandhi hospital, the last cleaning of overhead tanks were done one-anda-half month ago. also the officials seems to have taken no steps to ensure clean water supply after the flash rains lashed the city recently. rain water seeps into the overhead tanks through cracks and broken tank covers, which coupled with direct exposure to sun light, is resulting in formation of algae over the surface of water. in some of the overhead tanks, which were installed more than 15 years ago, there are hardly any provision to clean them.the staff deputed for the maintenance of tanks finds it difficult to clean the tanks because of narrow openings. to ensure pure water supply to the patients several water coolers were installed in both the hospitals. but due to lack of proper care and maintenance, most of them are reduced to scrap forcing the patients and their relatives to rely on overhead water supply.

13,City Congress unit opposed to direct mayoral elections,"pune: the plan to introduce direct elections to the mayoral post and to extend the mayorâ€™s term to five years, has come in for opposition from the city congress unit. with the state cabinet scheduled discuss the issue on wednesday, city congress chief mohan joshi has already dashed off a letter to the chief minister, in this regard. elected corporators have hitherto enjoyed the privilege of electing the first citizen. according to the latest state cabinet proposal, citizens would vote for the mayor directly, a system followed in several cities in the uk and usa. â€œif this system is to be followed, then candidates running for mayor would be required to launch bigger campaigns than those for mp,â€� mr joshi quipped. he pointed out that unlike in foreign countries, mayors the state did not enjoy financial executive powers. hence, there was no need to conduct direct elections to the post, he added. the congress unit has also demanded that the mayorâ€™s tenure should be restricted to one year. presently, mayors enjoy a tenure of two-and-a-half years, a system which was introduced last year. city mayor datta gaikwad has in fact had the honour of being elected to the post for three consecutive terms! political observers point out that most corporators aspire to becoming mayor. since mayors enjoyed only a year-long tenure till 2000, during a five-year term of the civic body, five ruling party corporators got a stint in the top seat.however, the extension of the tenure to twoand-half years, proportionately reduced the opportunities to become mayor. moreover, reservation of the post for women and backward class corporators, further reduced the chances of many an ambitious corporator. this led to unrest in the ruling party in the city and hence, the congress city unit has urged the chief minister to revert to the old system, wherein the mayorâ€™s tenure was just one year, the observers say.

16,Cong in a fix over anti-terror law,"new delhi: the vajpayee government's decision to promulgate an ordinance to combat terrorism, as a replacement for the lapsed terrorism and anti-disruptive activities act (tada), has once again placed the congress in a dilemma. it is unable to reject the proposed legislation as it would then be charged with not being serious enough about combating terrorism. on the other hand, it is unable to support it either, for past experience with tada shows how such laws are misused, particularly against minorities. the congress' problems will be forced to take a clear decision on this matter as the law cannot be passed in the rajya sabha without its support. congress sources indicated the party might eventually be forced to support the bill in parliament but it would do so only after pressuring the government to amend the bill to include further safeguards. as in the case of the government ban on simi and the us air attacks on afghanistan, the congress is unable to take a clear and firm view on the matter. ``the problem is that we cannot take extreme positions like the samajwadi party and the bjp,"" explained a worried senior congress leader. he said the congress was well aware that the bjp-led government was using the september 11 terror attacks to create a communal divide here, particularly up which is headed for assembly elections. congress leaders said the timing of the ban on simi, the war hysteria being built up by bjp cadres in up and the revival of the ayodhya issue are all pointers to the bjp's game plan in up. the congress' dilemma was obvious on wednesday when its spokesperson, anand sharma, did not outrightly reject the ordinance, saying the party would only be able to formulate its response after it had thoroughly scrutinised the full draft. sharma's objections were limited to the timing and manner in which the government had introduced the law through an ordinance, especially one perceived to be oppressive with far-reaching implications on human rights. he referred to the criminal law (amendment bill) pending in the rajya sabha since 1995, stating there was no justification for bringing an ordinance when parliament was already seized of the matter and the session is only four weeks away. ``we cannot give the government an easy ride. we have to make our presence felt or else they will take us for granted,"" commented a senior congress leader.

17,One-way rule challenged in HC,"bangalore: the seven-week old one-way rule enforced in the vicinity of k.r. circle on the nrupathunga road, post office road, k.g. road and palace road, has been challenged before the karnataka high court. a division bench comprising chief justice n.k. jain and justice n. kumar on wednesday issued notices to the state government, police commissioners, bangalore city corporation (bcc) and bangalore metropolitan transport corporation (bmtc) and the bangalore agenda task force (batf) on a writ petition filed by n.p amrutesh and another city-based advocate, challenging the one-way rule. the petitioners contended that the police commissioner had issued a notification in this regard and enforced the one-way rule temporarily for a month from august 26, which was further extended for a month. the rule is unscientific and unnecessary which has resulted in traffic jams, wastage of fuel, public time and loss of public funds. the respondents had not considered the representations made by the petitioners, advocates and the public seeking withdrawal of the rule. ``it is liable to be struck down as being illegal and injurious to public interest,'' petitioners contended. judges differ:the judges of a division bench of the karnataka high court on wednesday delivered two different judgments while disposing of an appeal filed by seven police constables who had been convicted and sentenced in a `lock-up' death case. while justice m.f. saldanha has set aside the convictions and allowed the appeal, the other member of the bench, justice s.r. bannur math has upheld the convictions and partly modified the sentences. in view of these different judgments, the matter will be placed before the chief justice for being referred to a third judge. police constables k.h. shekharappa and other six police constables of doddapet police station of shimoga were tried and convicted by the additional sessions judge on charges that they were guilty of murder and other offences, and convicted and sentenced to different periods. it was alleged by the prosecution that on august 13, 1988, one gurumurthy alias gurudutt who was in police custody, along with three others, was a victim of a brutal assault by the police resulting in his death. on a detailed scrutiny and reassessment of the evidence on record, the two judges have rendered different judgments. however, the bench allowed a separate appeal filed by h.m. gangadharappa, a police sub-inspector who had also been convicted in the same case. the judges have aquitted him stating that the charges against him had not been proved by the prosecution.

18,New terror law goes beyond TADA,"new delhi: the prevention of terrorism ordinance (poto), hurriedly promulgated on tuesday by the union cabinet, is the first concrete indication that civil liberties are also going to be a casualty of the new ``war against terrorism''. the law is intended as a replacement for the terrorism and disruptive activities (prevention) act, or tada, which was allowed to lapse in 1995 because of public outrage at the manner in which it was being abused by the police. tada was also spectacularly ineffective as an anti-terrorism law. according to the home ministry, 95 per cent of tada trials had ended in acquittals by 1994 and only one per cent of those arrested were convicted. by 1997, the conviction rate had climbed to 2.5 per cent. all the three militants freed after the hijacking of ic-814 ^ masood azhar, ahmed sheikh and mushtaq zargar ^ had been arrested under tada but their trials had been pending for between six and eight years. the new law is an improvement over tada in that it has formally dropped the catch-all crime ``disruptive activities'' under which even writings and speeches could fall foul of the law. however, since most of the acts defined as terrorist in poto are already proscribed by the indian penal code, the new law introduces an element of arbitrariness by seeking to target the intent of ``threatening the unity or integrity of india or striking terror in any section of the people''. thus, even ``ordinary'' criminal or ``disruptive'' acts could attract poto's stringent provisions ^ and parallel judicial process ^ if the police or government decide the aim was, for example, to threaten the unity of the country. one of the major criticisms of tada was that it was used in some states against legitimate political and protest activity such as strikes. poto does not do away with the danger of such misuse because it defines as terrorism any activity which disrupts ``essential supplies and services''. a state government could then, presumably, invoke the new law to arrest striking hospital, electricity or postal workers. while poto improves upon tada by ruling as inadmissible any confession made to a police officer below the rank of an sp and provides for the confession to be confirmed before a magistrate, this cannot prevent torture of suspects in a situation where the state government decides it is going to abuse the law. in the shaheen case, the supreme court found that tada was being misused at the state level, i.e. as a matter of systematic official policy, and not just at the level of individual policemen. in one crucial respect, poto goes even beyond tada by obliging citizens to ``furnish information in their possession'' to an investigating officer who believes they have it, failing which they could be imprisoned for up to three years. journalists, for example, could then be forced to divulge information the police believe is relevant, and the relatives of suspects could also be jailed if the police believe they are not parting with information they may or may not possess.

19,Overstaying journalists have to vacate govt housing,"new delhi: for nearly 70-odd print and photo journalists desperate to cling on to heavily subsidised government houses in the heart of the capital, it is the final nail in the coffin. on october 10, the cabinet committee on accommodation endorsed the union ministry of urban development's move to evict them from government houses which most have been occupying for years, even decades. according to ministry sources, the committee, which is chaired by union human resources development minister murli manohar joshi and has among its members urban development minister ananth kumar and water resources minister arjun sethi, considered the cases of the journalists concerned and turned down their request to be allowed to stay on. entreaties to be allowed to retain their accommodation have, in the last six months, also been made to prime minister atal behari vajpayee, union home minister l k advani and lok sabha speaker g m c balayogi. a delegation even met ananth kumar after stating they wanted to discuss a matter of ``urgent importance'' with him. but he, too, was firm about his ministry's decision. following the committee's decision, notices have been sent to the journalists from the director of estates in the ministry, achala sinha, asking them to vacate their houses by october 15. they have also been told that their request to retain accommodation cannot be acceded to since existing rules do not allow it. with none of them having vacated their accommodation until wednesday, ministry officials said beginning october 16, they would have to pay rent at market rates. this could range between rs 15,000 and rs 60,000 depending on the size and location of the bungalows most of them occupy for rentals amounting to a few hundred rupees. also, the ministry is expected to begin eviction proceedings against them under the public premises (eviction of unauthorised occupants) act, 1971. notices asking these journalists to vacate their government accommodation were first sent during the tenure of ananth kumar's predecessor, jagmohan, in mid-april. the ministry's move was prompted by the fact that not only do most of these 70-odd journalists own houses in delhi from which they collect substantial rent, but also the fact that most take accreditation from the press information bureau after retirement simply to retain their government houses.
