0,UT seat free from criminalisation of politics,"CHANDIGARH: Believe it or not, all the 17 candidates in the fray for the Chandigarh Lok Sabha seat have no criminal background. While the disease called criminalisation of politics afflicts the whole country, Chandigarh seems to stand out as an island of peaceful people, so to say.

A careful look at the affidavits filed by each of the candidates shows that none of them, except for independent candidate Arvind Jain, have a criminal case pending against them. The UT police had filed a minor case against Arvind Jain. His offence was a violation of the ban order imposed in the city under Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code under which not more than five people could gather at a place at a time.

Arvind Jain had led a protest by traders against the amendments to the Rent Control Act brought in by the Chandigarh administration.

The police had filed a case against him under Section 188 of IPC (disobedience to an order duly promulgated by a public servant) and the case had been taken cognisance of by the judicial magistrate (first class).

It is a minor offence inviting a punishment of imprisonment up to a maximum of six months or Rs 1,000 fine or both. ""I was arrested when my family along with my fellow traders and their families went to the Sukhna Lake to express our protest in the form of a shramdan.We were just carrying placards against the Rent Control Act amendments, yet we were arrested and a case was filed against me and 12 other traders,"" Jain explains.

On the reasons for the city politics being free of criminals, Jain explains that the residents are highly educated and enlightened. ""The voters will support only those with a clean image. No goonda can go scot-free here. People themselves will catch them and hand them over to the police,"" he adds.

Dr Rabindra Nath Sharma, a keen political observer from Panjab University, says the people are peace loving here. ""The people here do not resort to violent means to achieve their ends,"" he adds. He also points out that there is no power struggle in Chandigarh, as the government in the form of the Municipal Corporation has not much of financial powers.

""The criminals have no stake in the UT politics,"" he notes.

Indian National Lok Dal candidate Harmohan Dhawan says the citizens of the city are generally good people with a good knowledge of who should represent them. This was the reason for the city being free of criminalisation of politics, he adds.

Just like Dhawan, the other two main contenders for the seat - BJP''s Satya Pal Jain and Congress'' Pawan Kumar Bansal - have no criminal case pending against them.

1,"Flawless record of free, fair polls in UT","CHANDIGARH: It''s a â€˜feel-good'' factor of a different kind for which the NDA government cannot take credit â€” it exclusively goes to Chandigarh residents and our local netas. The Election Commission has never had to order repolling in the city for technical or law and order reasons in any of the 10 general elections conducted after Chandigarh became a Union Territory in 1966. Right from the first elections held here in 1967 to the last in 1999, the city has an unbroken history of free and fair polls.

Talking to The Times of India, INLD nominee Harmohan Dhawan said the fact that electoral malpractices had never vitiated free and fair polls reflected the spirit of healthy competition. Although repolling appears to have become an integral part of the democratic process in the country, the city has consistently bucked this electoral trend.

If there are no instances of vitiation of the poll process by rigging, boothcapturing, bogus voting, threat to voters or any other type of election fraud, the credit is shared by political parties and candidates who have cooperated with the administration to keep the electoral battles free from violence. BJP candidate Satya Pal Jain said the trend actually indicated the level of confidence of the electors in the democratic process. The fact that the election process has never been derailed in the city even when the conventional system of voting was in use, which is more prone to electoral malpractices, has made the election department extra optimistic that chances of vitiation of poll process are even less with electronic voting machines. Law and order reasons aside, there have been no cases of missing ballot papers or boxes that could warrant repolling.

The city''s unblemished election record has also removed hurdles in the way of observers appointed by the Election Commission to oversee the poll process. Guidelines issued by the EC for observers require them to study in advance and acquaint themselves with the pattern of electoral malpractices reported in a constituency in past elections to facilitate better planning. They can skip this part here. The report prepared by the observers is the most important input for taking a decision on ordering repolls or cancelling elections.

With the size of the electorate growing, voter turnout has spiralled upwards from about 49,000 in 1967 to 2.82 lakh in 1999 but the ""spirit of healthy competition"" apparently remains untouched by time.

2,Cong-NCP ministers offer to quit,"MUMBAI: Congress and Nationalist Congress Party members of the 67-strong Democratic Front ministry on Wednesday volunteered to resign to enable chief minister Sushilkumar Shinde to downsize his team.

However, this is not being done as part of cost cutting. With the July 7 deadline for restricting the size of all ministries to 15 per cent of the strength of the legislative assemblies fast approaching, the ministers do not want to run the risk of being sacked.

The size of ministries across the country is being limited following a constitutional amendment. Shinde will have to drop 24 ministers. At present, Congress and NCP have 28 members each in the ministry, while the remaining 11 ministers are Independents.

Shinde dare not sack the 11 Independent ministers since their support is crucial for the survival of his government. Hence, he has no choice but to turn to his own party, Congress, and its ally NCP.

The CM is expected to discuss the pruning exercise with NCP head honcho Sharad Pawar before wielding the axe. On Wednesday, Congress ministers offered to put in their papers to avoid political turbulence, with the assembly polls only five months away.

Taking the cue from their Congress counterparts, NCP ministers too decided to lay down office. State NCP chief R R Patil said Pawar would decide the fate of NCP ministers.

All the top posts in state-owned corporations and boards are already occupied and there is no way in which Shinde and Pawar can rehabilitate the sacked ministers.

Political observers said a decision would be taken after the DF tables its final budget during the six week-long session of the state assembly which begins on May 24.

â€œMoreover, elections to the Rajya Sabha are also scheduled in June-July. It is after the whole process of presenting the budget and Rajya Sabha elections that the CM and Pawar will work out the pruning exercise,â€™â€™ a minister said.

Observers claimed that the DF may go in for early assembly polls so as to avoid any controversy on this issue. Patil, however, categorically denied that any such proposal was under consideration.

3,Sena blames state ministers for Khed clash,"PUNE: Sena candidate from the Khed parliamentary constituency, Shivajirao Adhalrao Patil, has blamed state energy minister Dilip Valse-Patil for the clash between NCP and Sena workers at Landewadi in Ambegaon taluka on polling day.

â€œHe wanted to defame me, and inflame passions, because defeat is staring the NCP in its face on its home turf,â€� Shivajirao told a press conference on Wednesday.

He also accused the police of taking a partisan stand on the matter at the behest of state home minister R.R. Patil. Denying any involvement in the clash, he said, â€œI was only trying to pacify frayed tempers, when the incident happened.â€�

Trouble broke out on Monday, when Sena workers allegedly tried to prevent NCP workers from setting up a party booth. NCP leaders blamed Shivajirao and the police filed charges against him. The NCP even demanded a re-poll in the area.

Shivajirao, however, produced video footage to prove that the clash occurred when a group of eight NCP workers forcibly tried to enter the polling booth at Landewadi. When the locals tried to stop them, an argument broke out. â€œAlthough the police claim the NCP workers were polling agents, they had no documents to prove it,â€� Shivajirao said.

Shivajirao also alleged that an NCP activist had assaulted two Sena men with razors. Adhalrao also accused NCP workers and Valse-Patilâ€™s brother, Pratap, of trying to intimidate Sena polling agents and said the Manchar police had refused to register the Sena complaint in this regard. He also accused Valse-Patil of organising a morcha in Manchar to protest against Mondayâ€™s incident, although prohibitory orders were in place.

4,Dons in election fray: HC reserves order,"PATNA: The hearing on the writ petition filed by an organisation, Jan Chowkidar (People Watch), challenging the right of candidates under judicial custody to contest the ensuing Parliamentary election, concluded on Wednesday before the division bench of the Patna high court, comprising Chief Justice Ravi S Dhavan and Justice Shashank Kumar Singh. But the order was reserved for Friday. Jan Chowkidar''s convener Basant Kumar Choudhary, an advocate, appearing for the petitioner stated before the bench that in view of the provisions contained in section 62(5) of Representation of People Act (RPA), 1951, a person, who is confined in prison, whether under a sentence or imprisonment or transportation or otherwise,or in lawful custody of police shall not vote at any election.

Since a person in custody is debarred from even voting in any election during the period of his confinement, his right of being an elector is suspended and as such under Section 4 of RPA without being an elector he cannot qualify for membership of the Parliament, Choudhary argued, citing newspaper reports on how sitting RJD MP from Siwan Shahabuddin, independent MLA from Govindganj Rajan Tiwary and Ranveer Sena supremo Barmeshwar Nath Singh, who are behind bars under judicial custody in connection with a number of criminal cases, had filed their nomination papers from Siwan, Bettiah and Ara Lok Sabha seats respectively.

Choudhary further submitted that since there is a statutory bar for candidature in absence of any provision entitling a prisoner to file nomination, the nomination paper filed by a person, who is in prison, is liable to be cancelled and as such there is statutory obligation on the part of Chief Election Commissioner and chief electoral officer, Bihar, to cancel all such nomination papers. Additional advocate general S K Ghose, who appeared for Bihar government, advocate J P Karna, who appeared for Election Commission, standing counsel P K Shahi, who appeared for Union government and senior advocate Y V Giri, who appeared for Shahabuddin, advanced their arguments but none could satisfy the bench on the issue.

6,Principal of Ahmedabad school held for fraud,"AHMEDABAD: The Bapunagar police on Wednesday arrested the principal of Holy Child School Shashibala Sharma on charges of cheating and fraud.

Three other accused Dr Murlidhar Sharma, Hemangini Sharma and Madhubala Mehta, are still absconding. The BBA College run by the trust that runs the school was also inspected by Gujarat University officials.

It was found that some architecture students were studying at the same premises, despite building permission for the college given in Limbadiya village near Ahmedabad, where the trust already runs another school.

Even more shocking is the fact that both the school and college in Limbadiya have been given permission to run in a cow-shed! In a startling revelation, an assistant education inspector (AEI) has claimed that she had first brought irregularities of the now derecognised Holy Child School to the notice of the commissioner of schools as early as 1999-2000.

Kashmira Parikh, now an AEI at Patan recently informed the district education office, Ahmedabad (DEO) that she had submitted an adverse report earlier, against the school for running a dummy teachersâ€™ racket and showing fictitious students on its roster.

â€œParikh had prepared the report after a routine inspection of the school and submitted it to then commissioner of schools. This means, the officials did not heed her report at the time,â€� says a DEO official.

The latest bit of information points to the fact that the commissionerate of schools and Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board (GSHSB), that have launched an inspection drive in granted schools, should actually be looking within.

Parikh''s statement proves the fact that financial bungling has been on in many granted schools of the state such as Holy Child, in connivance with education department officials.
