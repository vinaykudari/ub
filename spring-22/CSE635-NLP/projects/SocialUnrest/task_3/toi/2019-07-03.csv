0,DSP arrested in multi-crore MPSC scam,"MUMBAI: Deputy superintendent of police Baban Kadam was arrested by the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) on Tuesday for his role in the multi-crore MPSC scam, in which aspiring sales tax inspectors and police sub-inspectors paid lakhs of rupees to ensure high marks in the entrance exam.

Mr Kadam is the fifth person to be arrested the case. The ACB has far raided 14 places Mumbai, Nashik and Thane and seized incriminating documents and Rs 40 lakhs in cash. Mr Kadam, attached the state director-generalâ€™s office, was arrested after the ACB conducted 20-hour search at his plush bungalow in Gorai. Several incriminating documents, 15 kg of silver ornaments and about two kg of gold were recovered. The ACB has booked him for possessing assets disproportionate to his known income. He is also accused of acting as a middleman in the scam.

Among the other suspects now absconding is sub-inspector from the Mumbai crime branch. Sanjay Patil allegedly collected money from some candidates who appeared in 1999 for the examinations, conducted by the Maharashtra Public Service Commission (MPSC), ACB sources alleged. An MPSC inquiry has found that 398 answer sheets had been replaced with sheets that fraudulently gave candidates much higher marks.

An officer said that Mr Patil worked as a front man for some MPSC officials and charged hopefuls anywhere between Rs 3 Rs 5 lakhs.

1,SAD(B) loses Delhi Gurdwara polls,"AMRITSAR: The defeat of Shiromani Akali Dal (Badal) Delhi unit in the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee elections (DSGMC) is likely to have an adverse impact on the fortunes of former chief minister and president of SAD(B) Paraksh Singh Badal.

With this setback, the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) in Punjab is the only major power center left with Badal after losing state Assembly elections this year.

On the other hand, the elated SGPC members loyal to Sarb Hind Shiromani Akali Dal (SHSAD) chief Gurcharan Singh Tohra who had extended support to SAD (Delhi) are eagerly looking forward to defection of Badal loyalist SGPC members to their fold. This will have major impact on the SGPC elections, say Sikh observers here.

There are some, however, who still opine that DSGMC election results would have little impact on the SGPC elections because of its varied electoral nature compared with that of Punjab.

One of the senior SGPC employees, on condition of anonymity, told TNN on Tuesday that SHSAD had enough ammunition in the form of controversial issues to embarrass Badal. Some of the issues he stated includes alleged relationship of SGPC president Kirpal Singh Badungar with the infamous Baba Piara Singh Bhaniara, alleged corruptions in various purchases, admissions scandals in the SGPC-run medical colleges besides alleged failure of SGPC in resolving disputes between the warring high priests.

Sukhdev Singh Bhaur, SGPC executive member loyal to Tohra, who in recent past had raised various issues, is once again set to target Badal loyalists in the committee. SGPC member loyal to SAD (B) Puran Singh Josh had also exposed alleged various irregularities and had levelled serious allegations against the SGPC management.

Bhaur, while talking to TNN over the phone, said that Sikhs of Delhi have given their verdict against the alleged anti-Panthic activities of Badal who had only promoted nepotism and had sheltered the corrupt persons both in the party and in the SGPC. â€˜â€˜The right time has come to take back the cont rol of SGPC form Badal and reinstate the maryada in SGPC,â€™â€™ said he. Taking a different stand, SGPCâ€™s general secretary Kiranjot Kaur said, â€˜â€˜As for now, I am unable to understand why the election canvassing could not be converted into votes in Delhi.â€™â€™

However, she said that whichever party wrests control of religious bodies, they should not compromise with the principals of the institutions. Asked about the impact of the defeat on SGPC, she said it was too early to predict any thing and added that they have to wait and watch before making any comments.

Interestingly, Parkash Kaur, sister of former Jathedar of Akal Takht Bhai Ranjit Singh, convener of SAD-D â€™s election campaign, who had contested on SAD-Delhiâ€™s ticket lost to Ranjit Singhâ€™s guru Gurcharan Singh Gatka Master.

2,"It's Bihar, BJP all the way in Vajpayee govt","NEW DELHI: Bihar and BJP have come to dominate the government of Atal Bihari Vajpayee. A dozen Biharis adorn the ministerial berths, while Tamil Nadu, with its multiplicity of membership of the National Democratic Alliance, comes next with nine members. Delhi, its political importance belying its tiny size, has half a dozen ministers.

This is not counting high-profile Bihari ministers whose constituencies are now part of Jharkhand. Or Delhi''s political bigwigs who have got elected from elsewhere. Following Monday''s changes, the BJP has as many as 56 members in the council of ministers, leaving only 20 berths for its NDA partners.

The 76-member council of ministers, one of the largest ever, has less than 20 members from the southern states of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. It was as if Vajpayee''s gaze did not go beyond Bihar. The Monday changes left the entire eastern and the north-eastern region untouched.

While there are 56 members from the BJP itself in the government, the Samata Party has four, Shiv Sena three, the Biju Janata Dal two, National Conference one and the Janata Dal (United), Akali Dal and Rashtriya Lok Dal one each. Among the parties from the south, the DMK has three members in the council of ministers and the PMK and MDMK two each. Of the 13 ministers inducted on Monday, two were from the PMK and one from Shiv Sena while the others belonged to the BJP.

There are eight members from Maharashtra, and six from Uttar Pradesh, including the Prime Minister, and five from Gujarat, including the Deputy Prime Minister.

Among the 32 ministers of Cabinet rank, 22 are from the BJP which holds among others the crucial portfolios of home, finance and external affairs. There are two Cabinet ministers from Samata Party, having defence and railways portforlios, two each from Shiv Sena and DMK besides one each from Akali Dal, JD-U, BJD and RLD.

These allies hold the portfolios of commerce and industry, power, agriculture, environment, chemicals and fertilisers, heavy industries and public enterprises and water resources.

The rest including parliamentary affairs, communications, information and broadcasting, disinvestment, HRD, science and technology, petroleum, law and justice and civil aviation are with the BJP ministers.

3,"Congress graph, coming polls make BJP up ante","NEW DELHI: The BJP''s decision to give more importance to the party rather than the government â€“ as demonstrated by Monday''s reshuffle â€“ follows an internal assessment by the party and Sangh, according to which the Congress â€“ which is in power in 13 states â€“ has peaked.

BJP sources say the Congress''s electoral graph can only dip now, regardless of the perception of the BJP-led government''s performance at the Centre, something that was heralded by the party''s victory in Goa. And with general elections slated for 2004, there was an urgent need to revamp the party and put in place a young and energetic team there.

With his strong background as an organisation man, Deputy Prime Minister Advani''s will be the dominant influence in the new party hierarchy. And with M Venkaiah Naidu in the party chief''s chair, and the decision that Advani will visit the BJP office once or twice a week to maintain ""live contact"" between government and party will ensure his control over the party.

Along with Advani, the other two winners in the BJP appear to be information technology minister Pramod Mahajan and Naidu. Apart from the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister, finance minister Jaswant Singh and occasionally, Fernandes, Mahajan is the only one of the BJP''s second generation leaders who has been involved at every stage in the consultations on the changes that have been made in the government and party. And now, in BJP circles, the buzz is that the recent changes herald the party''s Generation Next duo â€“ Mahajan and Naidu.

Meanwhile, according to NDA sources, the decision to push for LK Advani as Deputy Prime Minister dates back to mid-March, when the sangh parivar was upset at the manner in which the BJP''s allies in the NDA as well as the opposition had created a situation in which the Vishwa Hindu Parishad could not carry through its plans in Ayodhya. These sources said it was conveyed to the PM that he should over the next few months install Advani as Deputy PM or face the possibility of his government collapsing on the shila puja issue. In the end, the VHP conceded and there was an abbreviated ceremony minus any fanfare.

It was then that the PM asked NDA convenor George Fernandes to sound out the various NDA partners â€“ eventually, the changes took a few months with the violence in Gujarat and the tension on the border taking centrestage. And contrary to the belief that Vajpayee was the only acceptable face as far as the NDA allies were concerned, all the alliance partners concurred with the view that Advani should be made Deputy PM.

5,Delhi govt to enact law against power theft,"NEW DELHI: After handing over electricity transmission in the capital to private parties, the Delhi government is to bring in an Anti-Theft Power Bill in the coming Assembly session to help the companies curb the practice which causes huge losses every year.

Work is already in progress on the bill which will be an amended version of Indian Electricity Act and will be introduced in the Assembly in the coming session beginning July 15, Delhi Power Minister Ajay Maken said here on Wednesday.

He said such an act would help BSES and Tata Power, which have been handed over the transmission with effect from July one, come down heavily against the practice of power theft.

Expressing confidence that the Mumbai-based companies, having experience of over 70 years in the field, would improve the power situation in the capital, Maken said the Delhi government will extend all support to them in this endeavour.

Regarding the long-duration power cuts in many parts of Delhi on Tuesday, the minister denied that it was the result of sabotage by many sulking former employees of Delhi Vidyut Board.

""These are teething problems. We should give them time,"" he said.

To a question, he said the government would not intervene if the companies took action against ""lazy"" or ""corrupt"" former employees of DVB.

Junaid Sheikh, meanwhile, alleged following forcible closure of relief camps, around 20,000 people were on roads.

The state government was not providing them food supplies or cash doles, he said, adding, some social service organisations, like Aman Pathik, St Xaviers'' Social Service and Sanchetna, were, however, extending help to the people.

Sheikh said that despite many relief camps having been declared as closed, people preferred to put up at the same places braving heat, humidity and rains.

12,"NGOs, govt meet to make adoption easy","PUNE: The next time you find a destitute child wailing on the streets, don''t put him in a destitute home. Because, he may even find a better place.

A two-day state-level consultation of non-government organisations (NGOs) with the department of woman and child development in the city will finalise modalities for easy adoption or foster care of such children.

The programme, scheduled for July 6 and 7 at the Yashada hall in Baner, is being jointly organised by Cry (child relief and you) and Mumbai-based ""Saathi"", voluntary organisations working for underprivileged children.

Mansoor Quadri, general secretary of ""Saathi"", told reporters on Wednesday that the consultation was aimed at finalising the details for providing a family environment to such children. ""This is a part of the UN convention on rights of children to which India is a signatory,"" he said.

Sudhir Sudhal, a Cry member, said the primary aim was to develop alternatives to institutionalisation. ""Earlier, such children used to be put in destitute homes, but over the years it has been proven that this doesn''t help much.""

""We will be discussing alternatives like adoption, foster care, sponsorship and community centres,"" he said, adding that delegates from 55 NGOs across the state would participate in the programme.

13,State govt cancels NoC for Pimpalwadi plan,"MUMBAI: The state government has finally cancelled the no-objection certificate (NoC) issued by the housing board to a private developer, Shreepati Group, to redevelop a cluster of chawls in Girgaum known as Pimpalwadi.

The governmentâ€™s decision, taken a couple of days ago, comes in the wake of a scathing high court order, which passed severe strictures against senior officials of the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (Mhada) for handing over the Pimpalwadi property to the builder.

The officials include Mhadaâ€™s vice-president Uttam Khobragade and the housing repair board chairperson Sachin Ahir. Mr Ahir is a Nationalist Congress Party MLA and nephew of reformed gangster Arun Gawli.

The HC had directed the government to decide what action it should take against them. Although the court order is almost two months old, the state government has still not taken action against the erring officials. â€œIt is surprising that despite the court holding Mr Khobragade responsible for giving the green signal to the builder, the government has not thought it fit to transfer him out of Mhada,â€™â€™ Mantralaya sources told this paper.

In Mr Ahirâ€™s case, the court asked the government whether he should continue as chairperson of the repair board. However, sources said that since Mr Ahir is the only NCP MLA from Mumbai, his party leadership was not likely to take any action against him.

The Pimpalwadi property, comprising ten dilapidated buildings, was acquired by the government in 1988 for Mhada to rehabilitate 330 existing tenants as well as those living in transit camps. The housing board was supposed to redevelop all these buildings on its own and also construct additional tenements, which it could have sold in the open market for a huge profit.

14,V-C’s selection: Guidelines ignored,"PATIALA: Though the Punjab government has initiated the process for selecting vice-chancellor of the Punjabi University by constituting a three-members search committee, it would appear it has decided to ignore the UGC guidelines laid down for the selection of the V-C.

According to the guidelines the search committee for the selection of the V-C may comprise of a nominee of the chancellor, who should be the chairman of the committee and should be selected in consultation with the government concerned, a nominee of the chairman of the UGC, a nominee of the executive council (Syndicate) and a nominee of the Academic Council of the University. Notably, none of the three members of the selection committee falls in these categories.

Besides, the guidelines say that the nominee of the above authorities shall not be connected in any manner with the university concerned or any constituent parts, but in this case, a member of the search committee, HK Manmohan Singh, is the former V-C of the university.

Guidelines are clear that in no case there should be a provision for calling a fresh recommendation from the search committee nor should there be a provision for reconstituting the search committee.

According to guidelines, it is important that the chancellorâ€™s office should initiate the process and procedure for the preparation of panel for vice- chancellorship in a university at least six months before the office of the vice-chancellor is likely to fall vacant. But in the case of Punjabi University, no such activity was initiated from the due period.

The UGC guidelines clearly state that a university should not be left in the charge of an acting V-C, but in the case of Punjabi University, principal secretary, higher education, NS Rattan is working as the officiating V-C. Moreover, the UGC is against the practice of appointing an administrator in place of vice-chancellor.

The guidelines clearly say that the appointment of an administrator is not at all desirable and consistent with the nature of the university system. In absence of the V-C, the pro vice-chancellor shall officiate as the V-C.

In cases where there is no pro V-C, a senior dean/professor should function as the V-C. The guidelines categorically state that in no case an officer of the government should function as V-C but in the Punjabi University the pro V-C is being ignored.
