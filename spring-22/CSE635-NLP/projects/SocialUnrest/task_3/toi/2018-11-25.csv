0,Advani for state funding of polls,"new delhi: home minister advani has strongly advocated the state funding of political parties for elections and said the government was keen to bring in poll reforms to curb the increasing role of money-power in polls. the state funding of parties could be a better way out as it had worked well elsewhere. speaking at a workshop on ""money and democratic politics"" organised jointly by the election commission, cii and the commonwealth secretariat here on saturday, advani said the centre's keenness on poll reforms was evident from the recent decision to amend the law on election of rajya sabha members. ""they (rs members) will now be elected through open balloting so that there is no scope for malpractice in the form of cross-voting or of buying mlas,"" he said. the government, advani said, was basically considering two reports on poll reforms — one of the all-party indrajit gupta committee on poll financing and second, the congress party's report on donations. the indrajit gupta committee spoke of the kind of assistance that could be given by the state with no public funding in cash but in kind, he said. the government was also considering the possibility of individual contributions and see whether some tax relief can be given on that, he said. whatever legislation needed to curb use of money power in the polls will be brought, he added. noting that elections are a costly affair and are becoming more expensive, advani said funds generally come from business houses not in cheques but in black money. ""however, dependence on sources for large contributions is never a happy experience. and, if necessary care and diligence is not shown by the leadership, it can have very negative consequences on a political organisation,"" he said. stressing that state funding of parties for polls could one of the measures to check the influence of money power on elections, he said, ""many countries have adopted this. it has, on the whole, worked well although by itself it cannot be a panacea for all the ills of democracy.""

12,House joint session for terror law likely: Naidu,"thiruvananthapuram: bjp leader and union minister m venkaiah naidu said on sunday that the vajpayee government may indeed avail of the constitutional provision for a joint session of the parliament to pass the prevention of terrorism ordinance (poto). naidu, who was here to drum up popular support for poto, said that the option of a joint session was the only avenue open if the congress behaved irresponsibly. talking to newsmen, at a press conference, he said that he marvelled at the congress' political chichanery when it postulated that the dowry act, which was passed with the joint session of the house decades ago, appeared to the party more important that the integrity of the country. ""terrorism has claimed 53,000 innocent lives in india so far. how can anybody belittle the gravity of the situation?"" he said. blasting the opposition and human right activists, whom he accused of holding the brief of terrorists while ignoring the plight of civilians, naidu said, the congress of all parties should not have forgotten the acts it passed in the past, including the misa, the tada, the preventive detection act and the disturbed areas act. he also questioned opposition leaders on their opposition to poto even though 17 of the states had supported a stringent measure to deal with terrorism. ""why do they have two meanings for one word?"" he asked. ""maharashtra and karnataka have laws to deal with terrorism. west bengal was about to enact an act similar to poto but held it in abeyance when it learnt of the centre's move. "" it's a case of the ""devil quoting bible"", he derided the detractors of the bjp government. ""we have a funny situation where these people (opposition) say the government failed in rooting out terrorism from the country. on the other hand they do not want the government itself with an extra-ordinary law to curb the menace. the un security council has, in its recent solution numbered 1371, advised all nations to enact such laws to prevent terrorist threat."" calling poto's branding as ""anti-muslim"" by the congress and communist parties as cheap politics, he said, ""when similar allegations was raised by jaffer sherrif against tada, a study was done and it was found that muslims formed only four per cent of the total detenus under the act. ""terrorism has no faith, creed or caste."" naidu claimed there was total agreement on poto among the nda partners. the reported difference by chandrababu naidu on the issue was false. he also welcomed the ""principled stance"" the aiadmk had taken in supporting the terror law. the opposition's tirade against defence minister george fernandes was baseless, to say the least, he said. by refusing to ask the minister questions, the opposition was not serving people.

13,State civic councils gear up for polls,"mumbai: a new class of political leaders is emerging in maharashtra with 167 municipal councils in the state going for direct election of new presidents. as a result of direct election by citizens, these presidents will carry considerable political influence and extract better compliance from the reluctant administrations. while all the major political parties have swung into action for a bitter battle for supremacy, the mlas, representing assembly constituencies comprising these municipal councils feel threatened. the congress party took a lead in putting up candidates on the party symbol. other parties too took up the cue. this is a deviation from the normal practice of allowing party workers to set up their own civic fronts and fight the elections on their own. despite the fact that the major political parties have put their own candidates on their party symbols, civic fronts have set up political heavy weights to retain their control on the civic bodies. though the municipal councils are mostly having deficit budgets and no development funds, there are several government schemes, which keep on feeding these local self-government bodies. ministers and mlas are back in their constituencies to ensure that their rivals do not hijack the municipal councils. in most of the cases, fronts have been set up to oppose the candidates supported by sitting mlas. a congress mla from western maharashtra said that he could not allow his rivals to win the municipal councils from his constituency. a president of these municipal councils is a probable candidate for the next assembly elections. the state leaderships of the major political parties tried to remain away from the selection of candidates for these elections. for example, mpcc president govindrao adik asked district congress committees to select their own candidates. ""we considered cases where there were disputes at the local level,"" he said. political observers compare the municipal council presidents to the zilla parishad presidents though the zp presidents have more clout and financial powers. a zp president is also in the run for the assembly elections and proves to be a better legislator due his experience in running the zilla parishad. in fact, former chief minister late sudhakarrao naik had bestowed on this zp president status of a cabinet minister and wins them over to his side in his effort to set up his own network of prominent political leaders in the state. similarly, these directly elected municipal council presidents will also be playing an important role in the near future. despite the hard-line adopted by the congress as well as the ncp against joining hands with each other, the grass roots workers of both the parties have ignored this dictate due to the political compulsions at the ground level. in sindhudurg district in south konkan, leader of the opposition narayan rane is a force to reckon with. former congress mp sudhir sawant and ncp general secretary gurunath kulkarni have joined hands to set up a front to fight the shiv sena. sugar barons from the western maharashtra who occupy prominent positions in the government are also affected due to these municipal council elections. they have been divided between the congress and the ncp and know that if they fight separately, then the shiv sena-bjp alliance will gain out of division in traditional congress votes. in satara, ncp stalwart, former minister abhaysinhraje bhosale whose son has joined the congress, has set up a civic front while his archrival and nephew udayanraje bhosale has set up another front. former speaker shankarrao jagtap is supporting one panel, which is opposed by senior ncp leader and former minister shalinitai patil. finance minister jayant patil and rural development minister r.r. patil, both from sangli district are keenly observing developments in their respective constituencies and prefer panels. in solapur district, in most of the municipal councils civic fronts have been set up supported by powerful cooperative dons. the senior leaders of both the congress parties are turning a nelson's eye towards this informal understanding knowing well that if they interfere, they will burn their fingers in the fights between traditional rivals.

14,Stop abuse of election machinery: Governor,"mumbai: maharashtra governor p.c. alexander said that the anti-defection act has failed to achieve its desired objective to stop defection of legislators from one party to another. though there are several provisions to stop elected representatives from crossing floor, including their disqualification, they have used loopholes to indulge in this practice, he pointed out. addressing a yashwantrao chavan memorial lecture on 'accountability of parliamentary system in india', last week, he said individual defections had become rare but it had been replaced by en bloc defections, adding that the number of defections per year had increased after the anti-defection law came into force. the provision that makes a defection by one-third of the party strength a ""split"" in the party is being misused by the legislators, he added. this represents the major lacuna in our system and it should be tackled properly. the process of split shows that the members are not accountable to the voters as they change parties without facing the voters, mr alexander said. he suggested that the size of the council of ministers should be ten per cent of the membership of the house. once this suggestion is accepted, there is no major incentive for engineering defection . mr alexander said that the framers of the constitution preferred parliamentary system because they believed that accountability of the government was more important than its stability. he said that the corrupt and criminal elements influencing the electoral process was one of the major factors which has eroded the concept of accountability of elected representatives. if you want to ensure accountability of elected representatives, then the major lacuna in electoral process, of abuse of election machinery by corrupt and criminal elements, has to be stopped at any cost. mr alexander said that unfortunately there was no serious attempt by elected representatives to maintain even a ""semblance of contact"" with voters who sent them to the legislature. in many cases the legislators became conscious of their responsibilities to their electorate only when the next election is round the corner. of late, the trend in legislatures has been to neglect the important function of holding the ministers accountable through the forum of the house. time intended for questions, adjournment motions and debates was often misused for holding demonstrations and staging protests, he lamented. the governor suggested that the legislatures should take action against members who misused the forum of the house or defied directions of the speaker. punishment should be prompt and severe for all acts of disturbance of the working of the legislature or disobedience to the chair, he said. he also had a dig at coalition governments. he said some unhealthy trends had been noticed in the functioning of coalition governments as parties tried to retain their separate identity even though there was no differences on ideological grounds. ""the leaders of the small parties try to maintain their separate identity as political parties in order to get a share in the government. this type of coalition does not make the government more broad-based because such leaders have narrow following and do not represent distinct political base which brings stability or strength to the government,"" he said. the governor suggested that no political party should be considered eligible for a berth in the cabinet unless it had prescribed minimum number of seats in the legislature. ""if they do not have required number of seats in the house, then they should remain partners of the coalition without any berth in the cabinet.""

15,CBI has not bothered to probe Bhatkal incident: Kharge,"gulbarga: home minister mallikarjun kharge on sunday said the central bureau of investigation has not begun probe into the bhatkal and kambalpalli incidents, which had been referred to it a long time ago. ""this is why we were hesitating handing over the case to the cbi,"" kharge said. he is banking on bangalore police commissioner h.t. sangliana to take up the matter. but all this would be decided after receiving the report from the director general of police, he added. touching on the veerappan issue, kharge said the state government was yet to hear the cassette sent by the brigand to the tamil nadu government. both governments would then sit together and discuss the demands. he said the special task force of the two states were working in tandem to nab veerappan. asked about the arrest of sivasubramaniam, kharge said stf personnel had arrested him to collect information about veerappan's hideouts. kharge criticised the centre for not giving its assent to the karnataka organised crime act (koca) which has been pending for the president's assent for a year now. he blamed the union government for its partisan attitude as it has given the nod to the andhra pradesh government, though it was sent much later. appreciating koca, kharge said it was perfectly framed to prevent activities by the underworld and prevent organised crime. he said the act, modelled after maharashtra's moca, provided for punishment of police officials if arrests were made with ill intentions. according to the act, cases could be booked only by officers of the rank of dysp and above. on the flip side, those who feel they were being harassed by the act could approach a committee comprising the chief secretary, home secretary and law secretary of the state. they could even file an appeal before the high court, the minister said. the centre should have taken opposition parties into confidence while mooting prevention of terrorism ordinance (poto), kharge said. it clearly shows that the union government has brought this ordinance about for political gain, and is facing opposition. the karnataka government has sent a proposal of rs 750 crore for the modernisation of the police force over a period of five years. of this amount, the karnataka government is entitled to spend rs 82 crore every year and the centre to rs 82 crore. the centre has handed over the amount, which is going into building quarters for the police personnel and to strengthen border area police stations, the minister said. he said a provision of rs 10 crore has been made for the purchase of modern weapons. still on the police department, kharge said for the first time in the country, the karnataka government has framed rules for the promotion of constables and head constables to the post of sub-inspector. he said of the 700 vacant posts, 150 would be filled in this manner. these staffers could undergo departmental examinations for promotions, he added.

16,Jail inmates pay for lawyers’ strike,"ghaziabad: with lawyers in western uttar pradesh on strike for the past four months, inmates of a dozen district jails are in a jam. overcrowding, resulting from many undertrials' failure to obtain bail, is leading to both emotional stress and diseases due to insanitary conditions. in ghaziabad's dasna jail, which houses inmates from both noida and ghaziabad, undertrials and convicts have been ''taking turns'' to sleep in their packed cells. they have to bring their own blankets, bedding and warm clothes. in the hospital cells, patients have to sleep on the floor, said a senior jail official on condition of anonymity. two undertrials have died within three days of each other. both, said the jail's doctor, dr r k srivastava, died of diseases associated with overcrowding. surendra (35), accused of theft, died of fulminant hepatitis last thursday. and undertrial irshad (40) died of a burst blood vessel on monday. he was undergoing treatment for tuberculosis. dr b n tandon, former dean and head of gastro-enterology at aiims, explained that fulminant hepatitis was usually a form of water-borne hepatitis e. it destroys the liver and causes swelling in the brain, resulting in coronary failure. it is known to occur in closed, insanitary conditions like those in prisons and barracks. the dasna jail doctor, who is tending to tuberculosis, aids, fever and trauma cases in the overcrowded 20-bed hospital, described tb as a ''disease of overcrowding''. he said tb's causative organism lies latent in all of us. ''it can manifest its presence in closed and unhealthy conditions. irshad, who was diagnosed as having tb two months ago, had been in jail for about six months. surendra was here for over two years,'' dr srivastava said. the jail, which has a capacity of 600 currently contains almost 3,000 convicts and undertrials, despite efforts by the judiciary to decide as many bail cases as possible, without lawyers. there has been a considerable spurt in drug abuse, particularly that of smack and some synthetic drugs. and as inmates bring in their own bedding, clothes and woollens, the risk of infection goes up. scabies, a particularly troublesome and persistent skin disease, is on the increase as are viral fever and malaria. however, the district administration is yet to take remedial measures. jail superintendent ranvir singh could not be contacted for comment. ghaziabad additional district magistrate (executive) usha raman tripathi, who has been overseeing conditions in the jail, agreed that dasna is ''extremely overcrowded''. but about the death of the undertrials, tripathi said, ''a magisterial probe is soon going to be set up.'' asked if temporary arrangements could be made, by housing some of the inmates in police lines, tripathi said, ''this could be done in case of political prisoners. but criminals who escape from regular jails could much more easily escape from makeshift jails. we are trying to see what can be done.

17,Furore in BJP over party MP's function,"patna: factionalism surfaced in the bjp over afunction organised by dissident party mp madan prasad jaiswal here on saturday in which he along with another discontented bjp mp shatrughan sinha shared the stage with rjd chief laloo prasad yadav. the function held in the s k memorial hall under the auspices of the bihar pradesh jaiswal (sarvavargiya) mahasabha was boycotted by a majority of bjp leaders in the state with leader of the opposition in the state assembly sushil kumar modi describing the function as an insult to vaishya caste. jaiswal, who has aired his anger for not being given a berth in the union ministry, held the function on the pretext of honouring leaders belonging to the caste, organising marriages within the community and removing the dowry system from the caste. the function, which was organised to mark the 120th birth anniversary of eminent historian k p jaiswal, came close on the heels of a similar invitation extended to laloo by film star-turned-bjp mp shatrughan sinha on the occasion of the staging of his play pati, patni aur main. describing the invitation to laloo as an insult to the vaishyas, modi, himself a vaishya, told journalists that the community has suffered most under the rjd rule with a large-scale exodus of businessmen from the state due to increased lawlessness. ""over 10,000 members of the caste have fled the state under the laloo-rabri regime,"" he asserted. modi charged laloo with reneging on the promises of tax concessions to businessmen and creating a hospitable business environment. jaiswal has been feeling sore over the bjp central leadership's decision to induct junior leaders like rajiv pratap rudy and ravi shankar prasad from bihar into the union ministry, ignoring his claims while sinha has long been unhappy for not being accommodated in the union ministry despite the party using his services during elections. jaiswal has also complained about inadequate representation of vaishyas in the union government. modi countered this by saying that two members of the community, including vijay goel, have already found place in the union ministry while the leaders of the opposition in both houses of the state legislature are vaishyas. ""all mps cannot be made ministers,"" modi remarked. he, however, stated that sinha deserves to be included in the union ministry. while attending the function, the rjd supremo made obvious attempts to fan discontent in the two aggrieved bjp mps, saying that they have been sidelined despite their doing everything to strengthen the party. ""you will gain nothing by remaining a loyal soldier of the party as you have seen its consequences,"" he said. addressing the function, sinha said he has no ambition of becoming a minister. ""i cannot fawn on the bjp high command to find a place in the ministry... i cannot compromise my self-respect,"" he maintained while urging the business community to come forward to rid bihar of poverty. jaiswal described the saturday function as purely apolitical and denied that he wants to quit the bjp. in his speech, he urged laloo to provide adequate security to businessmen so that they can make positive contribution to society.
