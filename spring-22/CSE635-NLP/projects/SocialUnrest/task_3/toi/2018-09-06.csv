0,Indian foreign policy growing ambitious: Haider,"chandigarh: from regional to global considerations, indian foreign policy is growing ambitious and is slowly taking a new turn,'' says former indian foreign secre-tary salman haidar. while delivering a talk on 'tak-ing stock of foreign policy after agra' at a pn haksar memorial lecture series here on wednesday, haider said that although recent developments in the realm of for-eign policy had not been well artic-ulated, indian foreign policy was now definitely more ambitious. to-day, military component seems to be more important in formulating foreign policy; there is a perception that india's global emergence de-rives its strength from its nucleari-sation, he remarked. ''the sentiment of solidarity with third world countries now weighs less as do re-gional consider-ations. as a re-sult, organisa-tions like saarc have gone in limbo for the past many years. there is a lack of participation in regional is-sues even as core foreign policy concerns have moved to larger ambi-tions for future. the policies that guided us in the past have been slowly discarded,'' he said. elaborating on a few instances that have helped shape the shift, haidar said racism formed one of the central planks of indian foreign policy in the past. india was the first to protest against apartheid in the united nations. today, india is on the defen-sive due to its own caste is-sues being voiced at that forum. pointing to india's growing relationship with israel, haidar said this had made us ignore developments in the middle east. palestinian leader yasser arafat's recent visit to india did not even cause a stir. now concerns on the middle east are expressed in different tones. even group solidarity with the non-aligned movement and other afro-asian groups get less impor-tance. instead, global concerns and, more particularly, relations with the us figure with greater empha-sis. former us president bill clin-ton's visit, he said, has set a differ-ent order to indo-us relationship. india has now become a part of that small group that is perceived to have a global role. relating to nehru's vision of 50 years ago, when he looked at india as a possible global player, haidar said that vision was now slowly be-ing actualised. paradoxically, he said, this very fact has affected good neighbourly relations with pakistan and even other neigh-bouring countries who perceive in-dia as an emerging regional power. perhaps, we are pursuing a larger role for ourselves with a narrower vision, he concluded.

10,"People's will not above law, SC tells Jaya","new delhi: though the supreme court on thursday asserted that the people's mandate cannot override the constitution, tamil nadu chief minister jayalalithaa's counsel k k venugopal said if a murderer could continue as an mp, minister, chief minister or even prime minister until his conviction was confirmed by the superior courts, it would be reasonable to say that her conviction was not final till it was affirmed by the final court. related links addressing a five-judge constitution bench currently hearing a batch of petitions challenging the then tamil nadu governor m fathima beevi's decision to appoint jayalalithaa as chief minister in june, venugopal said disqualifying jayalalithaa would go against the will of the people, which was ""supreme in a democratic polity"". to this, the bench said: ""please consider what you are saying. today, it is a question of a sentence of two to three years. tomorrow, it may be a sentence for murder. are we left with no standards at all?"" justifying beevi's action, venugopal said: ""if the governor looks into any criteria other than the fact that the elected leader of the legislature party enjoyed the majority support of the house, then the will of the people will be defeated."" the bench, comprising justices s p bharucha, g b pattanaik, y k sabharwal, ruma pal and brijesh kumar, told venugopal: ""restrict yourself to the law. people's mandate cannot be more supreme than the constitution."" responding to venugopal's submission that despite her conviction people overwhelmingly voted for her party knowing fully well that if it came to power she would be the chief minister, the bench said: ""we are not concerned with the mandate of the people. constitution is supreme. that is what we are interpreting, not the people's mandate. ""the argument is that as the lady has been elected by a party (aiadmk) which has won overwhelming majority in the elections, we should respect it. we will respect it provided it is not in conflict with the constitution,"" justice bharucha remarked. venugopal replied that if the constitution itself was silent on the qualifications or disqualifications of a non-elected member being appointed cm by the governor, how could the court interpret the provisions to supplement that. at this, the bench remarked: ""if it can be so construed, then according to you it is open for anybody, whether convicted or not, to go to the electorate and get elected and assume office."" on the discretion of the governor to appoint a cm, the bench said: ""we are yet to come across a governor who has sworn in a person convicted under the prevention of corruption act. we have a constitution which has never imagined this. we have judgments which have never conceived this."" jayalalithaa was convicted under the pca. venugopal said: ""even if the court holds that the constitution barred even non-members from becoming ministers on the basis of a conviction, which is not expressly spelt out by constitution, the operation of such a ruling should be made prospective as the governor, while appointing jayalalithaa, did not have the benefit of this judgment."" he added: ""the people of tamil nadu believe that her conviction has become an irrelevant factor and they believe that she has been unjustly convicted. and hence, as the people's will is supreme she could become the cm."" the court, however, said: ""by all means. in that case she should wait till the order of conviction is set aside. because of this feeling, should the constitution be thrown overboard? we are hearing you and not the people. this kind of proposition will be dangerous.""

13,'DPC problems to darken US investment',"mumbai: the serious problems faced by us multinational investors in the indian power sector, including those with the dabhol power plant in maharashtra, have 'darkened the scope for foreign investment in the country'. ""i want to be frank. there is no doubt that problems put in the indian energy sector have put american investment in india in a shadow,"" us ambassador to india robert d blackwill told reporters after his speech on 'the future of us-india relations' at a function here on thursday. he said the ongoing disputes in india's power sector had 'darkened' india's investment climate and that the us was looking forward for 'an equitable solution among all parties to this issue soon.'

14,GE to review power investments in India,"mumbai: global conglomerate general electric has decided to review its investments in its power ventures in india. industry sources familiar with the development said the us major has decided to re-route its investments earmarked for india to other developing countries due to lack of clarity in the power policy and delay in achieving financial closure of power projects. as part of its rethinking on power investments in the country, general electric has informed the av birla group about its decision to not to go ahead with the engineering and procurement contract (epc) of the rs 2,060 crore 500 mw rosa power project in uttar pradesh. industry sources familiar with the development said, ``ge is not keen on selling their turbines in india as also to undertake engineering and procurement contracts due to delay in achieving financial closure of power projects.'' the public relations agency handling the general electric account here said that ge officials were unavailable for their comments. ge holds 10 per cent stake in the enron power corporation-promoted 615 mw dabhol power project in maharashtra. the company is planning to encash its investments when the us major sells its 65 per cent stake. the delay in achieving financial closure, coupled with lack of commitment from the state electricity board to undertake reforms, has taken its toll on several multinationals who have decided to pull out of power projects in the country. among them include the us utility major eastern generation pulling out of the kondapalli power project, national power from videocon-promoted power project in tamil nadu. aes power of the us has recently stated that it is reviewing its 49 per cent interest in orissa power corporation. av birla officials said in view of ge's decision against taking up the engineering and procurement contract, the group has decided to scout for a new epc contractor. in this regard the company has initiated talks with bharat heavy electricals ltd. (bhel) and abb alsthom. however, the officials said they have decided against ceding equity in the project to epc contractor which is the normal practice followed in a power project. as part of the commitment to any power project, the epc contractor is offered a minority equity in the project. engineering and procurement contract of any power project involves 65 per cent of the project cost including supplying of turbines for running the project. av birla group has decided to undertake the operations and maintenance contract in house, industry sources said. the group is close to achieving the financial closure by tieing up the funds from the financial institutions and banks.
