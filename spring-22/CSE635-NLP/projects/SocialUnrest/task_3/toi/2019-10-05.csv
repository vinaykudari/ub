0,Indian squirrel on way to extinction?,"PUNE: Human interference and â€œdevelopmentâ€� activities near forest areas might soon force the state animal of Maharashtra and pride of Bhimashankar Wildlife Sanctuary â€” the Indian Giant Squirrel (Ratufa indica elphinstoni) to join the list of extinct animals.

Commonly known as Shekru in Marathi, the giant squirrel is the star attraction at the 130.78 sq.km. Bhimashankar Wildlife Sanctuary. Although its population has remained constant (700 only) for the past two decades, forest officials and wildlife activists are concerned over the increasing human interference and â€œdevelopmentâ€�.

Although the state government in 1985 directed conservation of the bio-diversity of this tract, for the past few years, the sanctuary has come under the onslaught of imprudent picnickers, boisterous eatery owners, clamorous devotees and politicians.

Nature group Pugmarks founder Anirudh Chaoji said that despite strong opposition from environmentalist and wildlife organisations, a local politician has recently authorised fresh constructions near the temple area at Bhimashankar.

â€œConsequently, today there is a well-developed tar road passing through the forest area. Likewise, the temple area is dotted with vendors, eateries and fast-food joints,â€� rued Chaoji, adding that three years ago a proposal was mooted restricting vehicles to a parking lot 10 km away from the sanctuary, but in vain.

â€œToday, there is a huge parking lot in the heart of the sanctuary,â€� Chaoji said. The eateries and roadside dhabas generate mounds of litter all around everyday.

Also, smoke from the fast-food kitchens forces the shekru to leave its habitat in search of denser regions. Assistant conservator of forest (Bhimashankar wildlife sanctuary) V.T. Abhang told TNN that everyday, 25 field officers guard and patrol the entire sanctuary.

It is very difficult to get an accurate count of the squirrel population they are extremely agile and keep moving across high branches. However, there are 700 giant squirrels in the sanctuary today,â€� Abhang said.

The giant squirrels generally dwell evergreen, semi-green and deciduous forests. They are usually three feet length and about six inches in height. The three sub species found in western ghats are Ratufa indica indica, Ratufa indica elphinstoni and Ratufa dealbata.

â€œThey are arboreal and rarely come to the ground. They have a brownish dorsal coat colour and leap from one tree to another, across gaps upto 20-footwide,â€� said Abhang. The giant squirrels in Maharashtra are reddish brown colour, while the ones found in Madhya Pradesh and Kerala are brick-red and black respectively.

Abhang said squirrels get disturbed during the annual fanfares at the temple. Nearly three lakh devotees visit the Shiva temple during Shravan and Mahashivaratri every day. The department is celebrating Wildlife Week from October 1 to October 7.

1,6-year bar from election after prison term,"NEW DELHI: In a move aimed at cleansing the public life, the Union cabinet on Friday approved a proposal that a person convicted for social and economic offences, would be eligible for contesting an election only six years after his release from the prison.

An amendment to the Representation of the Peoples Act would remove a â€˜â€˜majorâ€™â€™ anomaly by which a person could notionally seek an elected office even while serving a prison sentence.

Information minister Sushma Swaraj said after the cabinet meeting that this had been pointed out by the National Commission for Women and a consensus had been reached among the political parties.

In effect, a Bill would be introduced to amend Section 8, sub-section (1) of the Representation of the Peoples Act, 1951, in the next session of Parliament. Besides crimes like murder and rape, the revision would cover additional offences under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 and Prevention of Terrorism Act (POTA). The TADA offences area already covered.

The new provision would provide for disqualification for six years from the date of conviction of a person where the punishment is only fine and the disqualification for the period of prison term and a further six yearsâ€™ periodafter the release.

The six yearsâ€™ disqualification was a benchmark determined by the framers of the original law, ostensibly with an idea to debar a person for two terms, the rationale being that the legislature would last its full five-year term, the minister explained in response to a query.

The sub-section (1) of the law provides for disqualification for specified offences for six years from the date of his or her conviction. In sub-section (2) the offences have been enumerated for which a person could be disqualified from the date of such conviction and continued disqualification for six more years if the prison sentence is not less than six months. The sub-sections (3) and (4) cover offences not provided in the earlier two sections.

2,‘Patents are incentives for disclosure’,"LUCKNOW: The Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants (CIMAP) hosted a one-day roving seminar on â€œIPR in biotechnologyâ€� on Friday. The event focussed on various aspects of intellectual property rights and the role of the patent system in the countryâ€™s macro economic policy for technological and industrial development.

In his inaugural address, BN Dhawan, former director of CDRI said that patent protection needed to strike a reasonable balance between adequate and effective protection of the rights of the patentees on the one hand, and the developmental and public interest needs of the nation, on the other. The varying degrees of patent protection, he pointed out â€” pharmacologically especially â€” has been one of the causes of friction between the developed and developing countries.

The current Indian patent laws he said, had several major differences with the provisions of the TRIPS agreement signed by India. However, the laws have enabled the Indian pharma industry make rapid progress as drug prices in the country are nearly 15 times lower than the global prices. India therefore, is currently a net exporter of drugs and the producer of the largest number of bulk drugs in the world. However, the scenario he said, was bound to change with the new guidelines coming into force. Dr Dhavan went on to list new guidelines and urgent steps, which need to be taken to avoid damage to the industry and cautioned the Indian pharma industry to be more vigilant about their IPR and premature disclosures.

In his welcome address, Dr SPS Khanuja, director, CIMAP said that the world today was moving towards real-time harnessing of the benefits of science, through commercialisation of products, processes and even genes â€” this is a platform, which will help strategise the objectives, goals and milestones in a targeted manner, he declared.

Dr KV Swaminathan from WITT emphasised that patents are, â€œnot a certificate of merit but an incentive for disclosureâ€�.

3,SAD (B) decides not to back INLD govt,"AMBALA: Shiromani Akali Dal (Badal), Haryana unit, has decided not to back the INLD government headed by chief minister Om Prakash Chautala. This was stated by state president of Haryana unit of SAD (B) Sukhdev Singh Gobindgarh here on Friday.

Gobindgarh while talking to mediapersons said that the party had decided not to make any alliance in future with the INLD as the SAD (B) workers were kept away from the functioning of the INLD government inspite of the full-fledged support given by them.

He alleged that Chautala broke all the promises made by him to their party.""Chautala had promised to give tickets to our candidates to contest the Vidhan Sabha elections but during election time he told us not to contest and promised to adjust our candidates.

However, not even a single position was given to any of our workers,â€� said Gobindgarh. He further alleged that Chautala did not call their party members for rallies and meetings. He declared that their party would contest on all the 90 seats of Vidhan Sabha in the next elections in the state.

Gobindgarh said that SAD (B) would protest and hold rallies in public interest against the present government and denied of any coalition with the Congress. The election strategy would be to give tickets to non-Sikh candidates also, he added.

He said that SGPC (Amritsar) was the supreme body and the constitution of a separate body at Haryana was not required.

4,DJJS followers march to DC's office in protest,"JALANDHAR: Tension in Nurmehal and Jalandhar mounted here on Friday with Divya Jyoti Jagriti Sansthan (DJJS), for the first time sending a fairly large procession of followers to the DC''s office and the latter deciding to inform chief minister Amarinder Singh about the issue ""taking a turn for the worse"".

The DJJS is believed to have reacted to the burning of the Ashutosh Maharaj''s effigy by some miscreants, after some Sikh organisations met at a gurdwara in Preetnagar on Thursday evening, to stage a protest against the satsangs being held by DJJS every Thursday and Sunday.

That DC K Siva Prasad decided to immediately contact the chief minister reflected the sensitivity of the issue as it ""took a new turn on Friday with the DJJS adopting a confrontationist approach, even though their procession was peaceful.""

The DC assured the spokespersons of the DJJS that ""action would be taken as per law and nobody would be allowed to take the law into their own hands.""

Asked if a case had been registered against those responsible for assaulting SP Pawan Kumar on Thursday evening, when he had tried to get a grip on the situation, the DC said, ""Yes a case is being registered.""

Hundreds of followers who appeared at the DC complex on Friday sat on dharna for over an hour in ""padam aasan"", giving out a message that they were for peace.

Even their spokesmen, who went into the DC''s office repeatedly said they were for peace. They said: ""Some mischievous elements want to incite crowds to violence like it happened on Thursday evening. How can anyone tolerate an attack on their â€˜bhagwan''. We are educated. We can understand that this is the handiwork of elements hired by vested interests. But the commonman does not understand this. They could get violent and things could go out of control. People turned up at the ashram at Nurmehal and said they were ready to die. But we managed to control the situation.""

5,LU Reader Bhadauria arrested on criminal charges,"LUCKNOW: Lucknow University (LU) created history on Friday but for all the wrong reasons. For the first time, a Reader Gajendra Singh Bhadauria was arrested and sent to jail on criminal charges. With two criminal cases to his discredit, police were now preparing to slap the Gangsterâ€™s Act on him.

The Vice-chancellor announced Bhadauriaâ€™s suspension soon after the news of his arrest was communicated to him. Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP), Lucknow, Anil Kumar Agarwal said that late on Thursday evening Bhadauria was picked up by the Hasanganj police in connection with a criminal case lodged against him by a junior clerk of the university.

In the FIR lodged on May 1, clerk Bhairon Prasad Gupta stated that he was reimbursing invigilation remuneration when Bhadauria, a reader at the department of Ancient Indian History (AIH), reached there and entered into a heated argument demanding more remuneration than what he was entitled to. Bhadauria allegedly assaulted him and tore the documents. Though the case was registered in May last itself, Bhadauria was arrested on Thursday night.

Soon after his arrest, the Mandiaon police slapped another case on him in which he was charged with criminal conspiracy in connection with attempt to murder another university lecturer Manoj Dixit on January 28, 2001. On Thursday Mandiaon police had arrested Sandeep Misra and Chitranjan Matty, who are said to be contract killers associated with Jitendra Singh Babloo gang. The two told the police that they were hired by Bhadauria to eliminate Dixit.

The SSP said that the police were preparing a case under the Gangsters Act against Bhadauria as he had connived with Gangsters.

Bhadauria has been hitting the headlines since 1997 when he was accused of being involved in a sex scandal. He was twice suspended but later reinstated. Now the third time, he ran out of luck.

6,Tibetans' protest Chinese envoy's visit to city,"CHANDIGARH: A routine protest by local Tibetans against the visit of Chinese ambassador Hua Jun Duo to the city turned into a major embarrassment for the Chandigarh administration on Thursday. Apparently unaware of Duo''s scheduled programme to inaugurate a photo exhibition depicting China''s heritage at the Government Art Gallery in Sector 10, where Union minister for chemicals Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa and advisor to the UT administrator Neeru Nanda were also to be present, the Chandigarh police failed to post security at the venue. Taking advantage of this, some 25 to 30 protesting members of the Regional Tibet Youth Congress (RTYC) confronted an advance party of the ambassador, which included the Chinese cultural counsellor, and chased them into the auditorium where a brief ceremony was planned before the formal inauguration. The advance party comprising four to five members had to beat a hasty retreat through a narrow fire exit, which was shut behind them. The protesters, however, broke through the fire exit by breaking the thick glass on it. But by then a small posse of not very well-equipped policemen led by superintendent of police (city) Baldev Singh had reached the venue, who roughed up some of the protesters and chased them away. Soon police reinforcements along with senior superintendent of police Parag Jain arrived on the scene, followed by Neeru Nanda and inspector general of police B S Bassi. However, by the time the ambassador, and after him Dhindsa, arrived things were back to normal and the ceremony went off smoothly. The incident had its aftershocks with the police registering a case of rioting against the protesting Tibetans after Neeru Nanda is understood to have expressed her displeasure to the senior police officers about the happening. The Chinese cultural counsellor is also learnt to have taken the members of the Indo-China Friendship Association, a collaborator in the ambassador''s entire itinerary, to task for not informing the police about the programme. Association''s general secretary B S Shergill, passed the buck to the administration saying it should have arranged for security as the show was organised by Lalit Kala Akademi and that they were only â€œcollaboratorsâ€�. Akademi secretary Madan Lal claimed their role was confined to displaying the exhibits in the gallery but an administration spokesman said the administration was in no way involved in organising the event.

7,Rly police identify body of riot victim,"VADODARA: After seven months, the Vadodara division railway police have identified the unknown body of a man, which they had found on March 2 in the Godhra-Vadodara Memu train during the peak of communal riots in the state.

The railway police here said that they had conducted a drive to identify the deceased by using his photograph, which they used to show to commuters on trains bound towards Godhra and Dahod.

The drive bore fruits when one Noor Mohammed recently recognised the deceased as Aktiar Mohammad Sabeer Khan Pathan, his 55-year-old co-worker at the brick kiln near Godhra railway station.

Recalling the fateful night of March 1, Mohammed told the railway police that Pathan and five of his other co-workers were sleeping in the brick kiln when some armed men attacked them. As Pathan was sleeping outside, he became their first target while the rest of them fled by catching the first train to Dehradun.

The police said that Pathan hailed from Kamalpur village in Khatgunj in Uttar Pradesh. He is survived by his wife Naseer Banu (50), a son (12) and a daughter (9). The police have asked Naseer Banu to approach the Kalol panchayat.

8,No govt funds for police refreshments,"KOLKATA: Be it drawing up puja guide maps or refreshments served at the meeting for the launch, the Kolkata Police have to depend on corporate sponsorship and private houses.

""Every year on the eve of Durga Puja, organisations like the IOC sponsor publication of guide books/ pamphlets for the Kolkata Police for distribution among the public, "" said DC (headquarters) Sivaji Ghosh in a rejoinder sent to The Times of India against a â€˜pictorial reportageâ€™ with the caption ""Whither Austerity?""

At the launch of the puja guide maps by Sujoy Chakraborty, Commissioner of Kolkata Police, on October 1, ""There were as many as 21 sponsors and the official release of these printed materials and hospitalities were also sponsored by them. No government fund is either sanctioned or spent in this connection, "" wrote DC (headquarters).

""There is a sanctioned fund for tea and biscuits served at meetings,"" said Chakraborty. The city police has a contingency fund where Rs 75 is allotted to cover the expenses of meetings only once a month.

""We have a benevolent fund where everyone down to the rank of a constable contributes every month. This money is used in case of emergency,"" said Chakraborty.

The contribution varies from Rs 17 to Rs 5. The money from the fund is used to cover medical expenses of policemen or their family or if somebody needs money for the cremation of a family member.

According to Ghosh, ""No funds are available from the government to publish puja guide maps. We have to run around to get sponsors in order to publish only for the convenience of the people during Puja.""

9,Unions to protest SCCL privatisation efforts,"KOTHAGUDEM: Recent developments in Singareni Collieries Company indicate that the management is all set to privatise open cast mines in the Kothagudem region.

However, trade unions-- the Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU) and Indian Federation of Trade Unions (IFTU) are planning to launch an agitation from Saturday to protest the move.

They alleged that as a prelude to privatisation, the company handed over some works to private parties and it is now planning to hand over coal exploration in open cast mines too to private parties.

SCCL privatised these projects in Koyagudem with a view to cut expenditure on exploration equipment, sources said. The cost of equipment, including side-dumpers and other machines, according to a technical expert in SCCL, would be Rs 35 lakh or more.

The unions alleged that the management had transferred nearly 1,000 coal fillers from Kothagudem to other regions in a phased manner, which they say was also a planned move of the management.

10,CPM calls for all-party meet,"VIJAYAWADA: CPM city secretary Ch Babu Rao has demanded that an all-party meeting be convened immediately to discuss the rehabilitation measures for the families evicted from the canal bunds in the city. Addressing a press conference here on Friday, Babu Rao criticised the Vijayawada Municipal Corporation authorities for evicting the encroachers from the canal bunds without providing rehabilitation. â€œThe VMC does not even have a proper plan nor necessary funds for the rehabilitation of the encroachers. More than 10,000 families living along the canal bunds for three decades now are worried about their future. It is a burning issue and should first be discussed in the VMC Council for appropriate action,â€� he said. Babu Rao questioned the need for removing encroachments when the government was anyway planning to sell away the canal bund sites to private parties. He said the authorities can as well regularise the encroachments by charging a fee. In this context, he demanded that the government cancel the lease granted to the Telugu Desam Party for the construction of a party office in 1,300 sq yd of irrigation land on the Ryves canal bund. The CPM activists conducted padayatras at Mutyalampadu, Madhuranagar, Gulabithota, Labbipet and Governorpet areas on Friday to protest the removal of encroachments. Babu Rao said a dharna would be held in front of the sub-collectorâ€™s office here on Saturday over the issue.

11,"Waive loans to farmers, demands CPI","GUNTUR: CPI state secretary Suravaram Sudhakara Reddy has demanded that the agriculture loans be waived off keeping in view of the severe drought.

Addressing a press conference here on Friday, he criticised that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government at the Centre was showing more enthusiasm in giving sops to heavy industries while not bothering about the agriculture sector in the country.

He alleged that the government declared nearly Rs 1 lakh crore as dead debts and non-performing assets, which were given in the form of loans to the big industrialists of the country.

However, the government was treating farmers as defaulters when they failed to repay the loan amounts that too in adverse seasonal conditions. He said that the drought situation was worsening in several states and sought immediate relief measures to be taken up by the government.

He recalled the decision taken by the V P Singh government in 1989, which gave a waiver of crop loans up to Rs 10,000 and emphasised such measures were the need of the hour. He also demanded that the State Assembly should be convened to discuss the drought situation in the state.

While stating that there is nothing wrong in inviting Chandrababu Naidu in the capacity of chief minister for inaugurating the Neelam Rajasekhara Reddy Bhavan at Hyderabad, Sudhakara Reddy ruled out any possibility of joining hands with the Telugu Desam Party in the next elections. He said that the CPI is not in a hurry to have an alliance with the TDP as long as it was part of NDA.

15,BSP not likely to join NDA govt,"NEW DELHI: The Bahujan Samaj Party is not likely to join the NDA government at the Centre even though it is heading a coalition in Uttar Pradesh in alliance with the BJP.

The prospects of the BSP joining the BJP-led NDA coalition at the Centre were not in the offing as of now since the two parties would first have to work out an alliance for Lok Sabha elections, party sources said.

Another factor that was weighing against BSP joining the Government at the Centre was that the party leadership was not keen on another ""power centre"" emerging at the Centre, the sources said.

The BSP, with 14 MPs in the Lok Sabha, is supporting the Vajpayee government from outside. ""As of now the BSP would continue to maintain this rather than joining the government,"" the BJP sources said.

The sources said Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani attending the Lucknow rally on September 28 was to signal the party cadres that the BSP-BJP alliance was firm unlike the past coalition governments formed by the two parties.

""We have to look at the long term interests of the party in the state which is crucial for BJP and it is in view of this that the party was keen on working out an alliance with BSP in Uttar Pradesh for Lok Sabha elections. The alliance in Uttar Pradesh would be beneficial to the party even at the all India level,"" the sources said.

16,Co-op minister finds China trip inspiring,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: China offered a model for the communists as well as countries like India, by proving how a poverty-stricken backward society could be taken to the path of fast-track progress with bold policy initiatives that suited the changing times, Co-operation minister and Communist Marxist Party leader M V Raghavan said on Saturday.

Raghavan, who recently toured China as part of an official delegation, said the changes that had been taking place in that country since the days of the late Deng Xiaoping were amazing, with a predominently agrarian society making great strides in all-round economic development.

""Creation of wealth is imperative for distribution of goods and services among the people. This in no way runs against the socialist ideology. Moreover, communism is not a rigid creed based on a Bible, Quran or Geeta,"" Raghavan who was expelled from the CPM in the late 1980s, said.

""The Chinese model holds a lesson or two to the Indian communists who still hold fast to out-dated precepts. Marxism has changed since the days of Marx, who himself knew that change is inevitable,"" he said.

17,Kannada protestors to boycott Tamil movies from tomorrow,"BANGALORE: Stepping up their agitation on the Cauvery issue, farmer leaders and Kannada protaganists on Saturday decided to boycott all Tamil movies and channels from Monday even as they urged Chief Minister S.M. Krishna not to ``succumb'''' to any force.

The meeting, convened by Kannada protaganist Vatal Nagaraj and attended by leaders of various political parties and farmer leaders, also urged Chief Minister S.M. Krishna to tell Prime Minister A.B. Vajpayee, once and for all, that the state has no water to release to Tamil Nadu.

``While we compliment our CM for refusing to release water, we, however, want him to stick to this stand and not to revise under any circumstances,'''' Nagaraj said.

Cauvery Horata Kriya Samiti Convenor and former MP G.

19,New water policy a sell-out: Expert,"PUNE: The Centre has mortgaged the countryâ€™s self respect and independence by proposing to hand over the management, distribution, use and ownership of its water sources to private companies, Magsaysay award-winner Rajendra Singh has said.

The noted water-conservation expert was commenting on the countryâ€™s new water policy (declared on April 1) on Friday, as part of a discussion on the recent world summit on sustainable development (WSSD) held at Johannesburg.

The discussion was organised by city NGO Gangotri and the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad.

â€œThe danger of multinational companies capturing and controlling our water sources is very real and the people will have to fight against it,â€� he said, adding that he had requested the prime minister to at least insert a clause saying that MNCs should be prevented from â€œcapturing water resourcesâ€�.

Underlining the general lack of awareness about water security and conservation in the country, Singh said, â€œWater management should be left to respective communities since the government is least interested in the job.

Singh also lamented the fact that developed countries, which had exploited natural resources the most, got their way when it came to drafting proposals at Johannesburg.

While the Indian government made scant preparations for the summit, MNC representatives came in droves to protect their vested interests, Singh pointed out.

They were canvassing for hygiene and sanitation in order to boost their sale. No wonder, there was no discussion on protection of water resources, water harvesting or community management of water.

Gangotri trustee Vijay Paranjpye said the official Indian representation was not to be seen when issues like poverty alleviation and equal distribution of water were being discussed in Johannesburg.

20,Gangster shoots self to escape arrest,"SURAT: Kanu Nath Boricha of Chhota Rajan gang shot himself to death in the wee hours of Saturday at Valsad when a team of police officials and commandoes from Surat cornered him at his hide-out in a residential society after laying a trap for the last two days.

Involved in several cases of extortion and murders â€” most sensational being the killing of builder Hanskamal Grover and Mehmood Paredwala some years back â€” Boricha had of late activated his network in the silk city.

According to police commissioner V K Gupta, the police had information that Boricha was in Valsad for the last three-four months.

Investigation by detection of crime branch sleuths revealed that he was living with his wife and three children in a flat at Chidanand Apartments in Mograwadi in Valsad under a fictitious name of â€˜Girish alias Subhas Patelâ€™.

A watch was kept on him for quite some time by a special police team from Surat .

In the early hours of Saturday, the police cordoned the flat where Boricha was staying.

When the police knocked on the door, there was no response for some time. According to Borichaâ€™s wife, she was asked by her husband to open the door while he went inside to fetch a pistol.

Seeing the police at the door, Boricha shot himself with a 9 mm pistol in the stomach. He was rushed to a nearby hospital where he was declared brought dead.

21,India cautious on Nepal govt dismissal,"NEW DELHI: India has reacted cautiously to the dismissal of Nepalese Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba by King Gyanendra.

While steering clear of passing any judgment on the dismissal, a carefully crafted response from the external affairs spokesperson described the postponement of elections as â€œunfortunateâ€�.

The statement is significant since Deuba being â€œincapable to conduct elections as scheduled earlierâ€� was the reason cited by Gyanendra for his decision, even though the decision on postponement of elections was backed by the major opposition parties, a fact mentioned in the external affairs spokespersonâ€™s response.

The external affairs spokeperson further said that India hoped the present crisis, which had been developing for sometime, would be â€œresolved soon within the framework of the consitutional processes, paving the way for elections at the earliest and installation of a democratically elected government in the interest of peace, stability and development in Nepal.

Spokesperson said, â€œthere are two pillars for stability in Nepal - multi-party democracy and consitutional monarchy and both these pillars should remain strong.â€�

""We are planning to play tape-recorders or even hold a magic show, to combat the ban. You have to give value for money to people who will spend hundreds on entry-tickets!"" said Shah.

Barely coping with the looming fear of terrorist attacks that saw a number of garbas being cancelled, the 10 pm deadline for loud-speakers has come as an added blow for the garba-organisers and late-night revellers.

""Navratri is the only big festival Gujarat has. Why do we have to make such a big issue of noise-pollution for these nine days? It would be better if people sing and dance in their societies and local lanes, as was Navratri was celebrated decades ago,"" says Sandeep Patel of the Devang Patel Group.

Miffed at the 10 pm deadline, the Patel group on Saturday decided to cancel their garba-shows at Nova village on October 13 and Karnavati Club on October 14. ""We would rather start work on a movie we have planned,"" Patel told TNN.

Patel is not alone. There have been a slew of cancellations of big-time garba celebrations across the state, which includes the prestigious MSU Fine Arts garba in Vadodara.

In Ahmedabad, the casualty is greater, with organisers like YMCA Club and Gandhi Decorators withdrawing from the celebrations. Individual organisers planning garbas at Karnavati Club, Rajpath Club and Gokul Club are also in two minds as they realise that the 10 pm deadline is for real!

""Such a restriction will dent the cultural identity of Gujarat. This will simply kill the spirit of the festival,"" said trustee of the Gujarat Orchestra Association, Anupam Vyas.

Garba enthusiasts in Vadodara, which regards itself as the garba capital, too, are an extremely disappointed lot.

""It is a strange decision. People come into garba venues only at 10 pm. Loudspeakers are necessary even for a group of 50 people and our garba attracts thousands,"" says Rajesh Parikh of Maa Shakti, one of the two most prestigious garbas in Vadodara.

""The Supreme Court order, as far as we interpret, is for organisations that use loudspeakers throughout the year. I don''t know how it has been made applicable for a programme that goes on for just nine days. Moreover, its not just noise and dance, Navratri and garba are also aesthetically pleasing,"" feels Dr Vijay Shah, organiser of the famous BITA-Indu Blood bank garba.

Not all have given up completely. Many organisers are desperately trying to make the best out of the current situation.

""I have asked my orchestra guys to arrange for at least five ''dhol-wallahs''. Loudspeakers may be banned, but we will try to make do with drums,"" says Rajiv Thakur, organising the Gokul Raas-Garba in Maninagar.

23,Rally turns violent in Bhavnagar,"BHAVNAGAR: Peace here was again shattered on Saturday afternoon after a 2,000-strong silent rally organised by several minority organisations, and led by the Muslim Welfare Committee, turned violent.

This was the second such incident in Bhavnagar within 72 hours. ""The situation is under control but tense,"" Bhavnagar SP Anupamsinh Gehlot told TNN.

The rally had reached the collectorâ€™s office where a charter of demands was handed over to district collector KA Patel.

While dispersing, some miscreants in the crowd began throwing stones in the Moti Bagh area, near the district panchayat office, damaging auto-rickshaws and breaking window panes of some shops.

The incident, which took place around 3 pm, was brought under control after police fired tear-gas shells and resorted to a lathi-charge. Several persons were arrested.

""The charter of demands says justice has not been provided to the minorities who have suffered during the riots. I tried to explain that the minorities had nothing to fear and that justice would be done,"" Patel told TNN.

The charter also complained about non-receipt of earthquake assistance.
