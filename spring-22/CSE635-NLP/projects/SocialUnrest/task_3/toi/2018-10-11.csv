16,Modi for selection not election,"gandhinagar: in a new twist to the bjp's reluctance to hold panchayat elections in the state, chief minister narendra modi has said that he wants to eliminate the ""evil of politics of vote"" from the villages. the chief minister, who has already announced that villages which co-opt their sarpanch and panch would be given incentives by the government, wants to ""create harmony in villages reviving the spirit of selection and not election"". this could be achieved through the medium of gram sabha, he said. the chief minister has told the administration to organise gram sabhas starting from jayprakash jayanti on thursday to sardar patel jayanti on october 31. while the opposition has accused him of sabotaging grassroots democracy, modi said ""in a democratic way, villagers should sit together and discuss their problems threadbare and with an open mind"". october 11 -- the first day -- is the birth centenary of jayprakash narayan while october 31 -- the last day -- is the 125th anniversary of the iron man of india, sardar vallabhbhai patel. to coincide with the two events, he said, the state government has decided to organise gram sabhas in all the 18,000 villages to make each of them strong and vibrant. on the gram sabha day, all concerned regional employees, talatis, minister, gram sevaks, health workers, primary teachers, vidya sahayaks, anganwadi workers, veterinary employees and panchayat workers will remain present and discharge their duties.

17,Social security schemes put govt in tight spot,"chandigarh:the punjab government is in the process of finalising its plan, according to which social security schemes will be funded. these schemes were grounded last month, following punjab and haryana high court striking down imposition of cess on sales tax for social security. under these schemes, the government provides financial assistance to older citizens (women above 60-years of age and men above 65 years), widows and destitute women, dependent children and disabled persons. all beneficiaries were receiving rs 200 per month, till last year. with the high court doing away with the cess on sales tax, the government is in a fix.arranging for at least rs 200 crore, to fund the social security schemes, is a gargantuan task. chief secretary nk arora said, ''the government is considering various proposals. like levy of surcharge on sales tax, which could be implemented soon.'' a senior officer of the department of excise and taxation added, ''still there would be a shortfall of at least rs 50 crore.this could be attributed to the fact that unlike cess, the surcharge will not be imposed on units enjoying sales tax exemption.'' with imposition of a uniform sales tax and value added tax (vat), the surcharge on sales tax could prove counterproductive, diverting trade to neighbouring states. this year, at least rs 78 lakh have been passed on to the social security department, which has furthered financial assistance to its beneficiaries till july 2001. but now the source has dried up.a delay would only send wrong signals to the beneficiaries, who would soon start resenting the state government.and with the assembly elections, only six months away, bad publicity is what the sad-bjp regime can ill-afford. the nature of the task to be performed worsens, given the number of beneficiaries, which are a staggering nine lakh. in march 1997, the number of beneficiaries was three lakh. the growth since then has been tremendous. their numbers have shot up especially during the past two years, with the government organising camps for enlisting beneficiaries under old-age pension scheme. nearly 80 per cent of the beneficiaries under social security schemes are older citizens. in 1999 also, the state government had failed to further financial aid to beneficiaries.the reason, a serious financial crisis. back then, the government had dug into the reserves of the state consolidated fund. the government had also imposed a cess on sales tax and had set up a separate account to facilitate disbursement.

18,"Rewind, play: Films on terrorism, patriotism set for re-run","mumbai: reel has just pressed the replay button to keep up with the real. with all their great leaps of imagination with rattle-tattle ambassadors and villain-mower machine guns, films made on terrorism, patriotism and war are poised for re-runs at theatres and on television, targeting a collective psyche overfed with extremist threats and sensational images of conflict currently. however, there are many others in the media business who are consciously keeping out, saying the attacks on u.s. establishments and the ensuing war in afghanistan are enormous human tragedies and too sensitive as issues to be cashed in. foremost among first-movers is karma, subhash ghai's self-styled tribute to patriotism, which is lined up for a high-profile re-release all over india on october 12. the press release is headlined: `patriotic karma comes back to unite india.' mr ghai says the timing is probably just right, and given the fact that ``karma has been the biggest grosser for my company__mukta arts__it should see crowds this time around again''. the film, which flew off the block in 1985 with the film-maker taking an early brush with six-track sound and 70 mm effect, stars dilip kumar, nasiruddin shah, anil kapoor, jackie shroff and anupam kher. in the movie, `mr dang' the head of the terrorist organisation harbouring the all-so-familiar grandiose design of destroying the nation, encounters a jail warden out to fight terrorism on his own terms. ``right now, there is a dearth of terrorism-related films. so the distributors approached me for karma and i agreed,'' says mr ghai. the other movie that has been retrieved from the sunset of its dream run and put back into orbit is mission kashmir. it is running in dreamland, its ads are becoming bigger and brighter again, and it is staging a comeback at satyam from friday. manoj desai, who owns the `g-series' of theatres including gaiety, galaxy and gossip, says he would be happy if distributors ask for his film that he shot almost entirely in afghanistan__khuda gawa__starring amitabh bachchan and sridevi. the opening scene was shot in mazar-e-sharif, and kabul features prominently in the film. ``najibullah was the president in '91, when we went for the shoot. he was exceptionally friendly,'' recalls mr desai, adding, ``if i get a slot free in my theatres, i'll run it, or karma for that matter.'' cable lines are also blazing with films like lawrence of arabia, platoon, saving private ryan and border in a deja vu of the kargil days. the ad flow, say cable business sources, has also gone up. and while sources say that there has been a sudden profusion of films like siege and speed on certain tv channels, the official line seems to be not to cash in on the situation. many say they are genuinely repulsed by the idea of commercially exploiting such profound tragedies. ``frankly, it's cheap. i don't think we will queue up terrorism-related or patriotic films now,'' says partha sinha, director, marketing of zee. vikramjeet roy of columbia pictures also says the u.s.-based production giant is averse to cash in on the situation. ``we respect the sensitivity of the issue.'' so despite having a battery of such movies including assignment, arlington road and devil zone, columbia is not encouraging their distribution now. a spokesperson for buena vista, which has produced big-time war and hijack films like pearl harbour and air force one, says it is ``unethical'' to make such films return with an eye on returns. according to raj nayak, marketing head of star tv, ``our programming of movie schedule is done three months in advance. we do not have any plans of scheduling anything particularly related to patriotism, terrorism, war etc.'' he adds that if by chance there happens to be such a movie scheduled in this period, it is purely co-incidental. even sony, which has mission kashmir lined up for end november, says it was not scheduled keeping the current events in mind.
