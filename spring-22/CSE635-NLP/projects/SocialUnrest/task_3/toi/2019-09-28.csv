1,CMC team left task incomplete: Krishna,"BANGALORE: Chief Minister S.M.Krishna said on Friday the task of the Cauvery Monitoring Committee (CMC) panel as assigned by Prime Minister A.B. Vajpayee has remained ``incomplete'''' as it did not visit the Cauvery delta region in Tamil Nadu.

The CMC team visited KRS, Kabini, Harangi and Hemavathy Cauvery reservoirs but did not visit Tamil Nadu''s reservoirs as the TN government objected to it.

When reporters sought his reaction to these developments, Krishna said: ``The task has now been rendered incomplete as the Committee could not gauge the status of standing crops, water storage and inflow in both the states.''''

To a question, he said: ``CMC was only following the PM''s mission and should have visited Tamil Nadu.''''

Referring to the truant monsoon, Krishna said farmers of the nation, not just Karnataka or Tamil Nadu, would suffer. This would in turn affect the nation''s economy and growth.

He declined to comment on Union Water Resources Minister Arjun Charan Sethi''s reported remark that Karnataka''s decision not to release water was ``unconstitutional''''.

Krishna has written to the PM highlighting this aspect, sources in the CM''s secretariat said. The letter has asked the Centre to bring this aspect to the notice of the Supreme Court.

2,Three of Abu Salem’s men arrested,"NEW DELHI: The Delhi Police on Friday claimed to have arrested three associates of underworld don Abu Salem, who were allegedly targeting city businessmen for extortion. While two of the accused â€” Sadiq (40) and Ishtiyaq (28) â€” are sharpshooters, the third, C P Rai (42), was responsible for receiving money through hawala to be paid to Salemâ€™s hitmen, the police said.

Chief metropolitan magistrate Sangeeta Dhingra Sehgal sent the accused to police custody till October 4. On July 26, a south Delhi businessman lodged a complaint with Delhi Police that he had been receiving threats from Salem and his Dubai-based associates, demanding Rs 1 crore. The businessmen was warned that if he did not pay, his family would be killed.

The police sent teams to Azamgarh, the native place of Salem and to Mumbai and Bhopal where the donâ€™s gang was active. From Azamgarh, the team learnt that one of Salemâ€™s gangsters had left the place for Old Delhi to target businessmen in the city.

The police came to know that the gangster would be going to the office of the south Delhi businessman who had not paid up on Thursday. A trap was laid and the three accused were arrested. A revolver, a Mauser and a pistol with 17 cartridges were recovered from them, the police said.

The police said Sadiq revealed he entered the crime world in 1985 when he killed the pradhan of his village. After being acquitted in the case, he went to Saudi Arabia, where Sadiqâ€™s younger brother, Zahid, was working for Salem. Later, Sadiq also joined Salemâ€™s gang.

The police said Ishtiyaq, Sadiqâ€™s first cousin, admitted to be being involved in criminal cases, including murders. Both Sadiq and Ishtiyaq are history sheeters in district Azamgarh.

C P Rai, who graduated from Azamgarh, initially worked in a liquor shop in Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh. Later, he became a personal assistant to a member of Parliament and set up his own business. The police said, in 1997 Rai came in contact with an associate of Salem, Narendra Mishra, who was killed in an encounter with the police in 1998.

3,Mastermind behind bus robbery arrested,"NEW DELHI: The mastermind of the bus robberies and hijackings that shook the city in the first week of September, Charanjeet Singh alias Dabboo (30), was arrested on Thursday afternoon. The accused allegedly had said that some Delhi Police personnel were involved in his activities.

Dabboo was arrested by the northeast district police from Dehradun. The police claimed Dabboo lead the criminals involved in the bus robberies. Dabboo allegedly ran a gang of about 12 to 14 criminals and was registered as a habitual offender with the Seelampur police.

He was involved in 36 cases of robbery, dacoity, attempt to murder and violation of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act and the Arms Act.

He was detained under the National Security Act last year and was released early this year.

â€˜â€˜Dabboo has confessed to his involvement in the bus dacoity at Dhaula Kuan and a robbery in Kashmiri Gate. He was also preparing to commit a dacoity in Hazrat Nizammuddin area,â€™â€™ said B K Gupta, joint commissioner, New Delhi range. His confession to the police, however, will not be admissible as evidence in court.

â€˜â€˜It is unfortunate that Dabboo was thriving and evading arrest due to the connivance of some policemen, former and serving. Delhi Police is going to take strict action against them,â€™â€™ Gupta said.

A special team was constituted to identify criminal groups operating in buses and it was found that Dabboo was involved in these crimes, deputy commissioner of police (northeast) Vivek Gogia said.

The northeast district police had apprehended five members of the Dabboo gang earlier this month. The arrest of five more gang members at Sarai Kale Khan on September 21 by the south district police provided some more vital clues, the police said.

â€˜â€˜During their interrogation it was learnt that Dabboo could be hiding in Uttranchal. A special police team under inspector Ombir Singh Bhati apprehended him on Thursday at about 2 pm in Dak Pather in Dehradun,â€™â€™ Gogia said.

5,Notice to admn over misuse of Rose Garden by protesters,"CHANDIGARH: The issue of trampling of the Rose Garden by Bhartiya Kisan Union activists, who had assembled here to draw the attention of the authorities towards the difficulties being faced by the farming community, figured in the Punjab and Haryana High Court on Friday through a public interest litigation.

The petitioner had sought directions especially in the nature of mandamus to the Chandigarh administration, the deputy commissioner and the municipal corporation, for taking urgent measures to save the Rose Garden and the Leisure Valley from a virtual carnage by the ongoing agitation and similar agitations in the future.

The petitioner, an advocate practising at the high court, also sought appropriate directions to the respondents to change the venue of public agitations from Jan Marg (Sector 16/17) to some other place not as busy.

A division bench of acting Chief Justice G S Singhvi and Justice Kiran Anand Lall, while taking cognisance of the fact that the residents of Chandigarh too were equally dutybound to maintain the cleanliness of places like the Rose Garden and Shanti Kunj used by them free of cost, issued notices to the Chandigarh administration and the municipal corporation for September 30, asking them to provide amenities like water and mobile toilets to the agitating farmers. The bench observed that the residents of Chandigarh were enjoying these facilities free of cost and more so at the cost of less privileged people, so it was their duty not to litter these places but to maintain them.

The petitioner has also sought an alternative site for agitations and dharnas. Singhvi and Lall also directed the Chandigarh administration and the municipal corporation to make a statement on September 30 about the steps being taken by them to provide basic amenities to farmers and prevent further damage to these public gardens. The bench observed that residents were not doing their bit in maintaining important public places like the Rose Garden, the Lake and the Shanti Kunj,which had begun to stink due to the litter thrown by people.

The petitioner,who had clippings the photographs and the news report carried by The Times of India, also pointed out that the respondents have permitted Jan Marg to be the venue the agitations, dharnas and other mass protests.

The petitioner said that for the last few years, it has become a fashion that all protests, agitations , dharnas and strikes in Chandigarh take place around Jan Marg. As a result, these gardens have become direct casualties of the agitations, particularly prolonged ones. The protesters used the gardens to ease themselves, besides bathing, resting and cooking. Bamboo and other trees are cut to make provision for cooking fuel and tender rose flowers and saplings are either trampled upon or plucked for the sake fun, the petitioner added.

The bench has directed the Chandigarh administration and its public health department to place on record the amount spent towards the maintenance of public parks.

6,Cong stands by promise of free power to farmers,"HYDERABAD: The Andhra Pradesh Congress Committee on Friday said the party was committed to providing free electricity to farmers once it comes to power.

The PCC has also asserted that there were no differences among the Congress rank and file in the state over the issue. â€œThe Congress has promised free power to farmers after studying the pros and cons of the issue in detail before the 1999 elections and the party will not back out from its promise,â€� PCC official spokesman V Arun Kumar said.

Arun Kumarâ€™s statement comes in the light of the controversy raised over the comments made by PCC president P Satyanarayana Rao on the Congress promise that the issue will have to be discussed thoroughly before including it in the manifesto.

â€œThe PCC president was mentioning only about the technicalities involved in the issue like referring it to the manifesto committee that would be constituted before the elections. But Satyanarayana Rao did not speak anything contrary to the party stand,â€� Arun Kumar said. He added that AICC general secretary and AP affairs in-charge Vayalar Ravi, on behalf of the party high command, had given his nod to the Congressâ€™ promise.

The PCC spokesman took strong exceptions to the ruling Telugu Desam Partyâ€™s (TDP) demand that CLP leader YS Rajasekhara Reddy call off his tours in the light of the PCC presidentâ€™s comments. He dared the ruling party to come forward for an open debate on the promises given by the Congress and TDP during their tenures.

7,OCR: City’s suicide point?,"LUCKNOW: Is the Old Councillors Residence (OCR) in Hussainganj turning into a suicide point? Prior to the suicide reported from the two high-rise complex on Friday, residents have witnessed similar suicide blood twice within the last one week and thrice in last three months, this year.

The increasing rate of suicide by youths at the OCR is not only feared to create in a sense of terror among the young minds residing there but may also give them ideas at times of stress. To begin with was the incident reported on June 21 when Kiran Bharti (20) of the nearby Udaiganj locality reportedly jumped to her death from one of the middle floors of B block. Though initially the incident was seen as that of murder, but later turned out to be one of suicide when the victimâ€™s elder brother Pawan revealed that she was suffering from acute mental stress.

Next on September 2 last when a failed CPMT aspirant Ashutosh Kumar (24), too, jumped from the high-rise complex to end his life. Son of a bank officer and residing at Kurmanchal Nagar in Ghazipur police circle, Ashutosh had come all the way to the OCR from his house situated more than 5 kilometres away. Though on the way there were other multi-storeyed buildings but what made Ashutosh choose the OCR to end his life remains a mystery till date.

The alleged suicide by Swati on Friday evening has created fear and anxiety among the residents.

â€œIt seems this place is getting jinxed,â€� commented a resident when this scribe reached the site to collect details of the incident. â€œThere is hardly a case that has been reported here and the investigations had come to their logical conclusion,â€� commented another suggesting that these cases were not mere suicides but had much more to them than could meet the eye.

But for the police, the suicide theory remains a convenient way to end investigations into a case. With no arrests to be made or chargesheet to be filed, a final report is all that is required to end the case once and for all.

9,State coffers opened for rallyists,"LUCKNOW: The state government has opened its coffers for the rally. Over Rs 2.5 crore has been sanctioned so far for the development of the rally site at Jail road. It does not include expenses incurred on transportation of the rallyists, electricity charges, publicity material and huge amount spent on the officers who have been camping at the venue for the last 15 days. The entire state government machinery descended at the venue on Friday.

However, till the evening only 60 per cent work was completed.

Only one gate out of four proposed were constructed till the evening and much of the ground was yet to be levelled. The officers, however, perfectly executed the â€œcover upâ€� exercise.

The soil in the freshly dug up ground was yet to settle down. Thus it was covered with durries and quick levelling by some bulldozers. Orders have been given to withdraw around 110 water tanks of Jal Sansthan and Jal Nigam from all over the city and deploy them for rallyists at the venue. A 630 KV transformer with electricity supply from Gomtinagar and Sarojininagar substations has been ensured along with a generator and air-conditioning facility on the dais.

White tiles costing around Rs 300 per square metre have been used between the front gate till the dais.

While on the side were the four huge cutouts (approx 40x10 feet) of BR Ambedkar, Kanshi Ram, LK Advani and Mayawati, on the other side there were huge cutouts of Mayawati and hoardings displaying the picture of Ambedkar smarak. Wall writings, posters, banners and flags have flooded the city.

Vehicles of VIPs, including senior officers of the chief ministerâ€™ secretariat, BSP ministers and senior district administration officials zoomed in and out all day.

Scores of bulldozers, over 400 labourers and officers of the LDA, the LESA, the LNN and half a dozen other departments were busy trying every trick up their sleeves to finish the â€œimpossibleâ€� by Saturday morning.

The company neeeds to improve outright turnover in the secondary market as STCI has fallen behind some primary dealers in this regard, Basu said, adding, the corporation also has to improve return on net worth.

The retail investment in government securities had not picked up well as they were able to get tax benefits and incentives for other government bonds with similar risk profile, he said.

11,BSP rallyists throw city life out of gear,"LUCKNOW: BSP supporters took over the state capital on the eve of partyâ€™s Dhikkar rally on Friday. Thousands of them poured in from all directions, deluging the city streets, throwing traffic out of gear and literally taking over almost all the public places and parks.

Undoubtedly, one could call it as articulation of â€œDalit powerâ€� but, due to inadequate preparedness the cityâ€™s civic amenities crumbled under the pressure.

Over 5 lakh people are expected to attend the rally. A rough estimate of civic authorities states that over 200 metric tonnes of solid waste would be added by the rallyist to the 1200 metric tonnes already generated in the city every day. Further, around 70 million litres of sewage is expected to add to 370 million litres daily produced in the city. And, certainly, all will not go down the drains. With civic authorities deploying around 70-odd mobile toilets, open grounds and roadside will become the â€œfavouriteâ€� places for rallyists.

In fact, the pressure was felt on Friday itself. The legislatorsâ€™ hostel of Darulshafa was packed to the fullest capacity with rallyists occupying all the corridors and stairs. The compound was reeking with a foul smell and residents complained about â€œsuffocatingâ€� atmosphere. With rallyists bathing and washing clothes in the open, peeing on roadsides, streets on the Darulshafa campus were full of filth and sludge. Similar scenes were seen outside OCR Building, Bahukhandi complex, Dayanidhan park, Begum Hazrat Mahal park, Ambedkar memorial and Charbagh railway station.

With rallyists occupying all the street pavements all along the Vidhan Sabha marg till Charbagh, from Chinhat on Faizabad road all the way till Gomtinagar and all around Ambedkar park as well, the places were turned into a garbage din. While from Ramkrishna, the barber in Darulshafa, to puri vendor Saroj outside Ravindrayala did a brisk business all day, the rallyists, however, dumped the leftover eatables and waste on the streets. Banana skins, polybags, leftover vegetables, pan masala pouches and human excretions were strewn all over the place outside Ambedkar park where hundreds took a night shelter.

The situation was no different near Ravindralaya and Bal Vidya Mandir at Charbagh where the makeshift vishramgrih for the rallyists were constructed by the district administration.

Though a handful of sweepers deployed by the LNN were seen working overtime, it proved too little for the huge amount of garbage generated by the rallyists. Unmindful of all the chaos they were generating, the rallyists moved around with excitement. Men rubbing tobacco leaves or puffing bidis led the way with women of the house in tow carrying bags and babies. Some had even brought stoves and food to meet all kinds of eventualities.

The traffic chaos was obvious with the huge turnout in the streets. Traffic jams and blockades were order of the day as rallyists walked around freely. While some kept to the road sides, however, whenever they had to cross the streets, they did so without caring about vehicles plying on the road. Forget about the problems of daily commuters, even VIP cars were forced to stop and give way to the rallyists crossing streets.

13,City buses diverted for use in BSP rally,"LUCKNOW: If the marriage of Laloo Prasad Yadavâ€™s daughter couple of months ago in Bihar saw brand new luxury cars being forcibly taken away to cart the baratis, the â€œMahadhikkar Rallyâ€� to be held here on Saturday is no different.

About 200 city buses were forcibly pulled off the roads on Friday evening. This is understood to have been done at the behest of transport minister Naseemuddin Siddiqui of BSP for use in the rally on Saturday.

According to sources, the district officials were busy arranging for free fuel for these buses. The decision to withdraw the buses put office-goers and other commuters to a great deal of inconvenience. At about 3:30 p.m. many buses from busy routes went off. Office-goers were seen waiting for hours at bus stops, in vain.

Later, it was found that nearly 200 city buses were parked at the Laxman Mela ground. Though the minister could not be contacted for comment, the administrative officials and those from the transport department stated that they were not aware of any move to divert the buses. â€œThe administration or the officials are not involved in this,â€� explained an officer when contacted by the Times News Network (TNN).

For the commuters, it was dikkat on the Mahadhikkar rally. â€œAs it is we are facing problems like traffic congestions all over the city owing to the movement of the rallyist, now the scarcity of city buses has made matters worse,â€� said a government employee waiting for the bus at an Ashok Marg stand.

â€œThe government must keep in mind that it is not a holiday today and neither there is one tomorrow. Then on what grounds has such a step been taken. We commuters are left in a lurch without any prior notice.â€� That was the reaction of many who waited long hours for a bus. A student of Madiaon who was to attend coaching classes in Hazratganj did not have a good word either. He had to miss his classes today due to the unannounced withdrawal of buses.

14,"J&K polls: NC, PDP face-off in Anantnag","SRINAGAR: With the Congress deciding to withdraw its candidates from three constituencies - Bijbehara, Homshalibugh and Pahalgam - in Anantnag district, it will virtually be straight fight between the ruling National Conference and People''s Democratic Party.

Forging an informal alliance, the Congress decided to withdraw its candidates in favour of other stronger Opposition party (PDP) to defeat the National Conference.

PDP vice-president and chief ministerial candidate Mehbooba Mufti is contesting from Pahalgam segment.

Although there are three other contestants in the fray, Mehbooba''s strongest challenge comes from National Conference candidate Rafi Ahmad Mir, who managed a sort of revenge by getting a party ticket against sitting MLA Abdul Kabir Bhat. Mir was earlier dropped by the party in favour of Bhat after winning the seat in 1987 elections.

The ruling party has put special emphasis on the Pahalgam segment to ensure that its candidate emerges victorious as Mehbooba had campaigned vigorously against NC president Omar Abdullah in Ganderbal segment.

The PDP has even gone to the extent of alleging that NC was using all unfair means to ensure Mehbooba''s defeat to exact revenge for Omar''s possible defeat.

The other candidates in the fray for this segment are Ghulam Nabi (CPM), Muhammad Yousuf Malik (BJP) and an independent Nazir Ahmad Khan.

In Bijbehara, NC and PDP will slug it out between themselves as here also Congress withdrew its candidate in favour of PDP to avoid division of opposition votes.

The segment was won by Mehbooba Mufti in 1996 elections on a Congress ticket but she quit her seat alleging perpetuation of corruption and nepotism by the state government and launched the PDP alongwith her father Mufti Mohammad Sayeed.

The ensuing by-election for the segment was won by PDP candidate Abdul Rehman Veeri, which adequately reflects Mufti''s hold on the segment, which had been represented by PDP president Sayeed in 1967 as a Congressman.

Veeri is seeking re-election against Abdul Gani Shah of NC. There are five other candidates in the fray for the seat with three independents and one each from BJP and Awami League.

The Homshalibugh segment would witness a quadrangular contest with PDP and NC being the main contenders.

Abdul Gafar Sofi is seeking election on PDP ticket and is facing the challenge of a new face Firdous Ahmed of the ruling party, which dropped the sitting MLA. Sofi is believed to hold an edge over Ahmad.

The three segments will be interesting to watch with the Opposition making a strong bid to wrest them.

Militant presence in the area is reportedly strong as is evident from the recent spurt in violence and more anti-poll attacks are apprehanded.

15,Temple attack was to incite communal riots: Advani,"NEW DELHI: Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani on Saturday asserted that the intention behind the terrorist attack on Akshardham temple in Gujarat was to provoke communal disturbances and said that the force behind it was being unmasked.

Describing the recent communal violence in Gujarat as an ""aberration"", he hailed the people of the state and rest of the country for maintaining calm after the temple attack, thereby defeating ""enemy''s diabolical conspiracy"" to cause a communal flare up.

""The intention of the two terrorists who attacked the Akshardham temple was not merely to kill devotees but to destroy the marvellous monument and provoke disturbances,"" Advani said at the inauguration of a seminar here.

""Evidence of who did it and who was behind it is slowly falling in place,"" he said, adding within three days of the attack, a breakthrough was achieved.

He said ""disturbance of communal peace and sparking Hindu-Muslim violence is the prime objective in the strategy of cross-border terrorism"" sponsored by Pakistan and this was reflected in the attack on the temple.

He lauded the role of security forces in rescuing people from the temple and killing the attackers.

The Deputy Prime Minister asserted that the Vajpayee government was committed to secularism and ensuring social harmony among various castes and communities.

""We have a proud record in this area - barring the sad and unfortunate episode in Gujarat. But this, I assure you, is an aberration. We should not let communal violence in Gujarat to be used as a pretext for political propaganda and much less for anti-India forces to malign and attack India,"" Advani said and cited reference by Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf to Gujarat during his recent speech at the UN.

Advani further said that India had a standing in the world because of its democracy and since National Democratic Alliance (NDA) assumed power three years back, there had been political stability in the country ""after a period of debilitating instability"".

Despite many obstacles such as economic sanctions after the Pokhran nuclear tests, the Kargil war, several natural calamities, the Vajpayee government had been ""steadily advancing the agenda of economic reforms"", he said.

""Our aim is to unleash, through these reforms, the tremendous untapped developmental potential in our nation of enviable natural and human resources,"" Advani said, adding the government was determined to accelerate India''s economic growth to 8 per cent annual GDP growth rate as envisaged in the 10th Plan document.
