0,Builders slam central rule on eco-clearance,"MUMBAI: City builders on Friday condemned a new country-wide regulation that requires developers to get environmental clearance from the Centre for all projects worth over Rs 50 crore. Builders said it would hamper development in Mumbai and Maharashtra.

The draft notification, issued by the environment ministry in October this year, states that all projects that cost more than Rs 50 crore, house over 1,000 people or involve discharging 50,000 litres of sewage a day must be assessed for environmental impact.

Most housing projects in Mumbaiâ€™s suburbs cost much more than Rs 50 crore because of the high land prices here, said representatives of the Maharashtra Chamber of Housing Industry at a press conference here on Friday.

â€œOne building in the island city and a project with several buildings in the suburbs easily crosses this amount. Even slum rehabilitation projects of over one-and-a-half-lakh square feet will also cost more than Rs 50 crore,â€™â€™ said Niranjan Hiranandani, who has filed objections with the ministry.

â€œWhat is Rs 50 crore today?â€™â€™ asked architect Hafeez Contractor, adding that if developers had to keep going to Delhi it would push up the costs and time frame of projects.

â€œAnd when the minister sitting in Mantralaya does not know what is happening in Borivli, how will someone in Delhi understand the situation?â€™â€™ he asked.

Incidentally, environment minister T.R. Baalu is part of the DMK party, which is at loggerheads with the AIADMK head and Tamil Nadu chief minister J. Jayalalithaa.

Over the past year, environment ministry notifications have scuttled some of Ms Jayalalithaaâ€™s projects in Chennai. Referring to this, Mr Hiranandani said, â€œIn the fight between Baalu and Jayalalithaa, we are getting affected.â€™â€™

Builders said the rule would affect construction of all residential and commercial projects, townships and even hospitals.

While the new rule is intended to ensure that large projects donâ€™t have an adverse impact on the environment, builders said they were taking care of sanitation and environment in their projects.

â€œThere are local zoning and sanitation laws for this, which we all have to follow,â€™â€™ said Sunil Mantri, secretary of the association. Builders said that while liberalisation and decentralisation was happening in every other sphere, a licence raj still prevailed in the land and housing sector.

â€œNo country has such laws, where local developers have to run all the way to the capital for housing projects. This will just promote corruption,â€™â€™ said Mr Hiranandani.

According to Mr Contractor, most of the new information technology companies want their buildings to be constructed and fitted out within six months. â€œThis will be impossible now,â€™â€™ he said.

â€œWhen the minister sitting in Mantralaya does not know what is happening in Borivli, how will someone in Delhi know?â€™â€™

3,Focus on rapid industrial development in state,"LUCKNOW: Youth of the state, it seems, will have to look for self-employment as a means for survival considering that employment opportunities were on a downswing in the state. Honing up entrepreneurship skills should be on top priority in times to come then.

On the first day of the two-day national seminar on ''Policy and Programme for Rapid Industrial Developmentâ€™ at Hotel Taj Residency on Friday, the minister for small industries, Jagdish Singh Rana said that besides improving infrastructure, the government will provide facilities to investors to promote industrial development in the state. The new industrial policy would be designed so as to encourage self-employment, he said.

Minister of state for small industries, Prabhudayal Valmiki said that industrialists should improve the quality of their products to counter global competition.

Mentioning that industrial development was a challenge, commissioner and director industries, Chanchal Kumar Tiwari said that there was a need to inculcate a global approach.

While director of the Institute of entrepreneurship development (IED), AK Srivastava informed that the seminar would focus on arriving at a solution after deliberations, seminar director AN Pandey said that since UP was an industrially backward state, policies and programmes had to be taken at the state level to ensure industrial development. Director Small Industries Service Institute (SISI), Shyam Dev commented on the paradigm shift in the policies of the government post WTO.

4,Punjab model for state development,"LUCKNOW: With only two months left to fulfil promise for a complete turnaround, the Mulayam government has now turned to adopting the ''Punjab model'' for speeding up the development wheel in Uttar Pradesh.

In an exclusive interview with Times News Network, the new chief secretary VK Diwan unfolded the government''s plan. ""Emphasis is on rural areas and developing infrastructure facilities,"" claimed Diwan, who took over as the head of state bureaucracy at a time when two of his predecessors were either unceremoniously removed or had to quit office.

Like Punjab, the road to development will now motor through villages in Uttar Pradesh. ""Power, education and health are the priority sectors in rural development,"" said the chief secretary.

Accordingly, electrification of villages has been accorded top priority under the new power policy announced by the state government recently.

""Even after 56 years of independence, over 40,000 villages have remained without power. All villages in the state will be electrified in the next five years,"" he promised.

This is not a mere promise but the government has already done the planning and arranged funds. Although the plan of action will be ready by February 15 but directions have already been issued to the UPPCL for energising 8,000 villages each year. A senior officer has been appointed in each district to supervise the rural electrification programme and orders for transformers, poles and wires have been placed.

The Central government has been approached to provide extra funds. The Rural Electricity Corporation (REC), which provides Rs 150 crore, has promised to double the funding. Funds available in Central government schemes like the PMGY will also be used to meet the expenditure.

Like in Punjab, roads are next in the priority list. For the first time, the government has decided to earmark 40 per cent of Mandi Parishad earnings for development and maintenance of roads.

""In Punjab, 70 per cent of Mandi Parishad earnings are used for rural roads,"" claimed Diwan justifying the government''s decision.

Mandi Parishad has constructed about 7,000 to 8,000 kms of roads in rural areas. The government emphasis is on carpeting another 2,000 kms and using the fund for maintenance of existing roads in villages.

Health, education and drinking water are other sectors which need to be strengthened further. To ensure presence of doctors in PHCs and CHCs, the government is planning to popularise ''mobile health services'' by sending team of doctors in villages all week days. ""Sending all children below 14 years of age to schools and checking dropout rate are main concern of the government,"" said Diwan.

But how all this will be done when the morale of the state bureaucracy is at its lowest ebb and corruption has become the order of the day? The new chief secretary said he didn''t like to work under ''undue'' pressure but, at the same time, he did know how to get things moving with his team.

""A bureaucrat should have the guts to say ''no'' but, at the same time, he should be judicious enough to distinguish between the right and the wrong and development related works and personal favours,"" quipped Diwan.

''Reward for honest and upright and punishment to corrupt'' is the message to state bureaucrats under him.

""I am unbiased. Transfers will not be used as atool but for speeding up development. Corruption will not be tolerated,"" warned Diwan.

5,Defamation notice against minister,"LUCKNOW: The Babri Masjid Action Committee (BMAC) has served a legal notice to and sought Rs 50 lakh damages from the minister for wakf Shakir Ali for issuing defamatory statements and derogatory remarks against Muslim leaders during a meeting on Thursday.

The AIMPLB legal advisor has also threatened to initiate criminal proceedings against the minister in the Mulayam cabinet.

""Members and office-bearers of the AIMPLB and the AIBMAC may initiate separate proceedings against the minister for his remarks against these two highest bodies of Muslims in the country,"" warned Jilani, who is also AIMPLB member. He has sought public apology within 10 days.

8,Doctors protest attack on colleague,"JAMSHEDPUR: Doctors at the state-run MGM Hospital on Friday struck work in protest against the assault on their colleague by relatives of a patient brought dead to the hospital late on Thursday night.

Hundreds of patients went unattended as the agitating doctors paralysed work both at the emergency and out-door units since the morning. The MGM is the only government hospital catering to poor patients in and around the Steel City here. The striking doctors castigated the police for failing to prevent the last nights brawl at the emergency ward.

Sources alleged the doctor on duty was allegedly in front of the police that preferred to remain a mute spectator. Eyewitness said the trouble started after a police patrolling party brought a middle-aged man found near a bus stand to the hospital. The doctor declared the person dead after examination and ordered to shift the body to the post-mortem unit.

The relatives and the friends of the victim, who arrived at the scene moments later, allegedly bashed the doctor for shifting the body to the post-mortem unit and not keeping it at the emergency ward. Meanwhile, the East Singhbhum deputy commissioner Sunil Kumar Barnwal on Friday afternoon held a meeting with the striking doctors to persuade them to call off their strike.

The district authorities have assured better security arrangement to prevent recurrence of similar incidents in the hospital.

9,Nine accused yet to be arrested in Mehndi case,"PATIALA: Leaving popstar Daler Mehndi aside, nine others are yet to be arrested in the illegal human trafficking case.

These persons are Daler Mehndi''s wife Daljit Kaur, Shamsher Mehndi''s wife Balwinder Kaur, Bulbul Mehta, Rakesh Kaushal alias Rockey, Gurdial Mama, Surinder Singh, Tejinder Singh Ladi, Dhian Singh and Harchand Singh. Shamsher Mehndi, in a complaint recently filed in a local court had alleged that Surinder Singh, Tejinder Singh Ladi, Dhian Singh and Gurdial Mama were the accused in the case along with the complainants, Bakhshish Singh and Jaswinder Singh. The court has already rejected the anticipatory bail application of Balwinder Kaur and Bulbul Mehta. The others are said to have gone underground.

The police have also started to verify the authenticity of the complaints of 32 persons which had surfaced after the registration of the case against the Mehndi brothers and others.

SSP, Patiala, A S Rai told Times News Network here on Friday that the authenticity of these complaints could be proved or disapproved only in the presence of both the parties. With Daler''s arrest, the police is now in a position to check the legitimacy of the complaints, he added.

Rai clarified that if a complaint was found baseless, the police would definitely initiate proceedings against the guilty under section 182 of the IPC.

Sources said that many complaints were baseless and the complainants were fearing police action. Daler''s involvement in the illegal human trafficking case would be decided on the basis of these complaints, but it would be impossible for him to prove his disassociation with his brother Shamsher Mehndi as after his arrest.

He had claimed in his complaint filed before inspector general, Patiala, Shashi Kant that he had disassociated himself from Shamsher in March 2001. Sources said that the police have sufficient proof that despite the public notice printed in a section of the press, Daler was still associated with Shamsher. Besides, Shamsher''s website also claims that he is working with Daler as a musician.

10,Stamp scam: Telgi's lawyer accuses Baig,"BANGALORE/NEW DELHI: Fake stamp paper scam kingpin Abdul Kareem Telgi''s advocate Abdul Rehman on Friday accused Karnataka minister R Roshan Baig and Maharashtra deputy chief minister Chaggan Bhujbal of being ""major beneficiaries"" of the scam.

Rehman told the media after meeting Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani in New Delhi that he had named the two and sought protection.

Baig, speaking to The Times of India from New Delhi, denied the allegation. ""I will file a defamation suit against Rehman. I have nothing to do with the scam,"" he contended.

Asked whether he would put in his papers until he is cleared of the suspicion, Baig asked: ""Why should I?""

Baig said: ""The printing of fake stamp papers or currencies is an anti-national activity and I will be the last person to indulge in it. I have come up the hard way in politics and have maintained some standards in public life. I am innocent.""

Stampit chief and ADGP R. Srikumar, however, said an arrest warrant has been issued against Baig''s younger brother Rehan. ""He is not available. But another accomplice of Telgi, Fayaz Ahmed was arrested from Tumkur on Friday,"" he added.

Stampit has posted on its website photographs of four persons including Rehan as ""Wanted"" under the multicrore stamp paper scam. The site said cases have been registered against them by Upparpet police station.

On the Stampit manhunt for his brother, Baig said Rehan was away on a pilgrimage and would be coming to Bangalore on Saturday.

Both chief minister S M Krishna and home minister Mallikarjun M. Kharge declined to react to the allegation made against Baig. Kharge told reporters in Bangalore: ""We will not respond to what a client''s advocate says. Stampit is conducting every kind of investigation required and it will take action against all those involved, be it X,Y or Z.""

Kharge contended that Karnataka had taken the lead over all other states and filed 11 chargesheets. ""Several of these have come to the stage of sentencing in the special court. This is not the stage to hand it over to the CBI or anybody else,"" he maintained.

11,"His marathon from law ends, Daler is arrested","NEW DELHI: Punjabi singer Daler Mehndi was arrested from a Vasant Vihar house on Friday afternoon. A special cell team of the Delhi Police nabbed Mehndi hours after his advocate promised the Supreme Court that he will surrender before a court in Patiala.

Earlier in the morning, Mehendi''s advocate, Kapil Sibal, gave an undertaking in the apex court that his client would appear before the local court in Patiala on January 8.

Following this submission, Justice Doraiswamy Raju and Justice Arijit Passayat fixed January 16 as the date for hearing Mehndi''s bail plea.

But at 3 pm on Friday, the police team arrested Mehndi, who was staying at his friend Shamsher Singh''s Vasant Vihar residence.

According to Delhi Police, Mehndi had reached Vasant Vihar on Thursday night. ""Before that he was hiding with another friend, Jagdeep Singh Dhumal, in Vasant Kunj,"" said the special cell officer.

Both Singh and Dhumal are property dealers. A special cell officer said: ""Nonbailable warrants (NBW) against Mehndi were to lapse on Saturday and, since there was no stay on the NBW, we went ahead with the arrest.""

The Supreme Court did not restrain the police from arresting him.

Mehndi''s advocate, D K Garg, however, termed it illegal. He said: ""The Supreme Court had specified that Mehndi would inform the SP of Patiala before surrendering. The local police was supposed to provide him with security.""

Immediately after his arrest, a Punjab police team was sent to Delhi. They would seek transit and police remand of Mehndi, Patiala police chief A S Rai said.

The Patiala police had registered a case of cheating against Mehndi and his brother, Shamsher Singh Mehndi, on September 29. While he was arrested, Daler escaped. He moved an anticipatory bail application on October 23 before the Delhi High Court which granted interim relief for 10 days. On November 3, however, the high court dismissed his application.

12,Energy minister rules out talks with farmers,"AHMEDABAD: Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS), with its threat of organising rallies on eve of Republic Day, could not get the attention it wanted from the state Energy minister Saurabh Patel, who on Friday ruled out possibility of talks with the farmers. The BKS have been demanding complete withdrawal of the hike in power tariff for agriculture sector.

""It is a closed chapter since the government has offered concessions to farmers as recommended by the cabinet sub-committee and nothing more was left to be done on the issue,"" said Patel, while addressing a news conference on the occasion of Siddhi Yatra.

Meanwhile, the minister claimed that for the first time, the Gujarat Electricity Board (GEB) earned an additional income of Rs 390 crore by checking powerthefts during July to November. This, he said, was a major achievement of the BJP government. Under the voluntary disclosure scheme, 1,26,000 consumers confessed to power-thefts, fetching the exchequer Rs 20 crore, he added.

Referring to the proposed new power projects the minister said that as per the programme schedule the GEB would set up 13 new power projects with power generation capacity of 6945 MW.While it has entered into agreements for four new projects having 1414 MW capacity, some of these projects will be commissioned next year. The government, he said, has signed MoUs for power generation and distribution worth Rs 27,000 crore and some of them would be operational by 2005.

Patel said that the government has already entrusted the gas grid project to the private firms and for Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar Adani group has been selected to implement the project which would be completed by the end of next year.

The work for setting up of CNG stations was also in full swing and CNG would be used as a fuel for automobiles by February or March. The state transport corporation has decided to run CNG buses in Surat city while Ahmedabad Municipal Transport Service (AMTS) has also chalked out a plan for CNG-run buses.

13,US slams Gujarat for riots record,"AHMEDABAD: A US State Department report on international religious freedom has slammed India, and particularly Gujarat, for a poor record in protecting the interests of religious minorities.

The ''International Religious Freedom Report 2003'', which was released on Thursday in Washington by the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labour is seen as the official position of the US Administration on the subject.

Almost 15 pages in the voluminous report have been devoted to India, with a clear focus on incidents in Gujarat which took place last year and the failure of the government to deal with the matter subsequently.

The report says after the Godhra train burning case, ""Hindu mobs in Gujarat, incited and organised by members of the Sangh Parivar, destroyed Muslim businesses, raped Muslim women, and killed an estimated 2,000 Muslims. In addition, 100,000 Muslims were forcibly displaced into makeshift camps throughout Gujarat. The government closed the camps in mid-June, forcing the displaced to return to burnt houses.

""Initially, the government announced a probe only of the attack on the train; however, after criticism by Opposition parties and the media, the government expanded the probe to include the violence after the attack on the train.""

The report further said, ""Human rights groups expressed concern that those responsible for the Gujarat violence may never be tried or convicted for their crimes.

They charged that although the government initially arrested thousands following the attacks, most of those arrested have since been acquitted, released on bail with no further action taken, or simply released. In addition, even when cases did reach trial, Muslim victims often faced biased prosecutors. Judges and lawyers representing Muslim victims also have faced harassment and threats.""

The report says that in some instances of Hindu aggression against Muslims, police and government officials abetted the violence, and at times, security forces were responsible for abuses.

""Police sometimes assisted Hindu fundamentalists in committing violent acts,"" said the report. It said human rights activists reported that the Gujarat Police received specific instructions not to take action to prevent a possible violent reaction to the February 27 attack on the train. The report said that in December 2002, ""the BJP, with its Hindutva brand of politics, won the Gujarat election in a landslide, sweeping those constituencies in the central part of the state that were most affected by the rioting"".

The report said, ""The state government appointed a judicial commission to investigate the riots. (This) investigation has been criticised by the media and human rights activists"".

14,Centre takes a break from farm price policy,"NEW DELHI: In a departure from the past farm price policies that provided annual increases in the minimum support prices (MSP) for foodgrain, the government on Thursday kept the MSP for 2003-04 rabi wheat pegged virtually at 2002-03 level while providing substantial hikes in MSP for oilseeds and pulses in a bid to encourage diversification of Indian agriculture.

This is for the first time in years that the government has not hiked the MSP for wheat.

Unlike in the past, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) strictly went by the recommendations of the Commission for Agriculture Costs and prices (CACP), not succumbing to political pulls and pressures from the farm lobbies.

The MSP for wheat for 2003-04 rabi crop, to be marketed in 2004-05, has been fixed at Rs 630 a quintal against last year''s Rs 620. But last year, the wheat producers were also given a drought incentive of Rs 10 a quintal. There is therefore no actual increase in MSP for wheat for rabi 2003-04.

The skewed farm price policies over the years have rendered Indian foodgrains uncompetitive in the world markets, led to public overprocurement, created problems of management of mountains of grain stocks, increased the carrying costs for grain and priced out grains from the reach of the hungry poor in the country.

By the significant change it brought about in farm price policy on Thursday, the Vajpayee government has signalled that is it serious about heralding a ""second green revolution"".

Crop diversification from grains to oilseeds and pulses and to horticulture forms a key element of this second green revolution strategy, analysts said.

The 2003-04 rabi MSP for gram and masur (lentil) is thus hiked by Rs 180 each and rapeseed/ mustard and safflower have got increases of Rs 270 and 200, respectively.

15,SC notice on death of Britons in Gujarat riots,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday issued notice to the Gujarat government and the Centre on a petition by UK-based Imran Mohammad Salim Dawood alleging that he and his relatives were cornered by a mob on February 28, a day after the Godhra train carnage incident.

The petitioner said four of his relatives, including three British nationals, were killed. Dawood accused the Gujarat police of shoddy investigation into the killing of the three British nationals and sought a CBI probe into it.

A Bench of Chief Justice V N Khare and Justices S B Sinha and S H Kapadia asked the state government and the Centre to file their responses within two weeks.

Dawood''s counsel said the British high commission repeatedly wrote to the police saying that the accused mentioned in the complaint were not arrested. The response of the police was that investigation was on to trace the culprits.

The court also asked the Gujarat government to provide a status report on the number of accused in all the riot cases, those on bail and those in custody.

Gujarat government''s counsel and additional solicitor-general Mukul Rohtagi said several cases were referred by petitioners and amicus Harish Salve where the high court has granted bail to the accused, yet the blame is put on the state government.

In its status report, the Gujarat government gave details of the riot cases and said more than 24,000 accused had been arrested in substantive offences and more than 2,090 chargesheet filed.

Rohtagi said the trial in the Godhra train carnage incident need not be stayed as it was nobody''s case that there was anything amiss in it. The court asked for the comments of Salve, who is assisting the court in Gujarat violence matters, on this issue.

17,Peace rally in Srinagar on New Year Day,"JAMMU: Coalition partners in the Jammu and Kashmir government will organise a massive peace rally in Srinagar on New Year Day, to emphasise the early opening of the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad Road to pave way for meeting of the families on the either sides of the Line of Control.

The peace rally, which comes ahead of the Saarc summit in Islamabad, will commence at noon and was expected to draw people from across the Kashmir division, an official release said on Saturday.

Coalition partners in the state government took a decision to this effect at a meeting chaired by Chief Minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed on Friday evening, it said.

The rally would give impetus to the ongoing peace process and strengthen confidence-building measure taken by India and Pakistan to normalise ties, it said.

Sayeed said the prospect of reopening of the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad road had kindled hope among the people on the either side who have divided families.

He said the resolution passed by the state Assembly hailing the peace process had a very good impact and represented the longing of the people of Jammu and Kashmir for peace and friendly relations between the two neighbours.

The peace rally would reflect the strong urge of people of the state for the success of the peace process, he said.

""We have to go back to the people and explain to them that their government has accorded top priority to the restoration of peace with dignity and seek their involvement in the process,"" he said.
