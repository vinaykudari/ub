3,New terror law to cover flaws of present law,"lucknow: india needs to fight terrorism, not the prevention of terrorism ordinance (poto), says union law minister arun jaitley, who describes it absolutely necessary to overcome the inadequacies of the existing law to deal with the growing menace of the terrorism. in an informal chat with the times news network during a discussion, jaitley said around 54,000 people had fallen to the terrorist bullets, the worst of it being the gruesome assassination of former prime minister rajiv gandhi. while we condemn terrorism, we fail to achieve much on this front, he said adding that it was all because of an inadequate law for this purpose. most of us are the critics of the tada, but the fact remains that whatever dent was made in the trial of the rajiv gandhi case was because of the tada. otherwise, it would have been difficult to prosecute a single culprit, jaitley said. the existing law was not adequate to deal with the terrorists, particularly those of the suicide squad, who were was out to eliminate their target or get eliminated themselves, he said. but then terrorism goes beyond such kind of action and for it one needs to intercept terrorist communication and their funding or supporting agency. however, action against them is possible under a special law like the poto and not a simple law under which evidence against them are not admissible in the court of law, jaitely said. hoping that the poto would find smooth sailing in the forthcoming session of the lok sabha despite opposition, jaitely said that false notions about it were unfounded and uncalled for. specific safeguards had been taken in the ordinance with a view to prevent the possibility of the misuse of the special powers given to the investigating officer and address the concern of violation of human rights raised in different quarters. but at the same time, precautions had been taken against dilution of any of its provisions. underlining some of its provisions, he said no court could take cognizance of an offence under the ordinance unless the sanction of the state governments or the centre, as the case might be, was obtained. thus, this would provide an opportunity for review in each case so that proper application of the provisions of the ordinance could be made. similarly, investigation of an offence under the ordinance has to be done by an officer not below the rank of deputy superintendent of police. further, unlike the tada (p) act, 1987, the ordinance provides safeguards against abuse of the provision relating to admissibility of confession made before a police officer by stipulating that such confession must be recorded before a magistrate within 48 hours, he said. a legal practitioner on behalf of the accused shall be allowed to be present during the interrogation, but not throughout his interrogation in line with the supreme court judgment in dk basu case. these measures are designed to contain allegations of torture. it is now provided that courts will not hold that the accused had committed an offence under section 27 and section 52 of the ordinance providing for possession of explosives, refusal to provide samples of finger prints, saliva etc for investigation. the courts can only draw adverse inference. this is unlike the provisions in tada (p) act, he said. notably, the maximum period of police remand from up to 60 days under the tada has been reduced to 30 days now and for judicial custody it has been reduced from up to one year to three months, which can be extended up to six months, if chargesheet is not filed. similarly, there are provisions for prosecution of police officers for malafide actions under the poto with provision of compensation to the affected persons in such cases, said jaitely.

5,Paswan for CMP in assembly polls,"lucknow: lok janshakti party president ram vilas paswan is of the view that the allies of the bjp-led government in the state should contest the forthcoming vidhan sabha elections in uttar pradesh on a common manifesto and a common minimum programme. he said that it would not only help the leaders of various constituents of nda to canvass for one another's candidates, but would also help both bjp and its allies to get the benefit of the popularity gained by the state government under the leadership of rajnath singh in an exclusive interview, paswan, who is union minister of coal and mines, said that with a common manifesto, it would be easier to convince the people about the government's achievements. it would also check the possibility of the leaders of different parties speaking in different tunes during election campaign. since rajnath singh has taken over as the chief minister of the state not only has the graph of the bjp gone up considerably but the position of its allies has also improved a lot, he said. cautioning the nda constituents in the state to play their cards very carefully, he said that the next vidhan sabha election results were bound to have a great impact on the stability of the central government. he said that it would be the first election after the lok sabha elections which would befought in a state having a bjp-led government. if the bjp and the allies work as a team, then they are sure to win with a thumping majority, he added. paswan said that it was high time the political parties gave up the politics of caste and religion and started doing ideology-based politics with the support of all communities. he asserted that caste-based politics was done only by those who were weak and lacked credibility among the masses. asserting that the bsp had done nothing for the benefit of the dalits, he said that this party (bsp) had only exploited them by collecting money from them. dalits had no alternative but to support bsp in the past, but now the situation had changed with the emergence of the lok janshakti party, he said. evading a question regarding the rashtriya lok dal's demand for 100 seats in the vidhan sabha polls, paswan said that the bjp and its allies should sit together and finalise the names of the candidates in the near future. he said that so far his party was concerned, he would be happy if such seats on which the candidates of bjp and its allies were not even on second or third positions were given to his party. he said that instead of trying to field larger number of candidates, bjp and its allies should try to ensure that only such candidates were fielded by them who have winning prospects.

9,Vajpayee for open debate on terror law,"new delhi: seeking a national consensus on the policy on national security, prime minister atal bihari vajpayee on saturday advocated a ""free and frank"" debate on anti- terrorism ordinance, saying the centre has taken care to remove the shortcomings in tada that lapsed six years back without a successor law to combat terrorism.

inaugurating the day-long chief ministers'' conference on internal security, vajpayee also sought the establishment of a federal agency to deal with terrorism across the country.

""we have come across a number of cases where conspiracies for terrorist action have spread across a number of states. although discussions on this were initiated a year back, we do not not have as yet any agency in place, which can take on and pursue such cases on its own,"" he told a day-long conference of chief ministers on internal security here.

the prime minister regretted ""enormous delays"" in trials due to huge pendency of cases and said the inefficiency in the criminal justice administration system led to criminals committing further crimes with impugnity.

he said all murderous groups, wherever they may be in kashmir or elsewhere, must be declared as terrorist organisations by all civilised nations. ""their sources of funding have to be plugged. countries giving safe sanctuaries or any other kind of support to them must be placed under sanctions,"" he said.

in an obvious reference to pakistan and afghanistan, vajpayee said new delhi has been alerting major countries to the fact that some countries in india''s neighbourhood had made export of terrorism and religious extremism an ""important instrument"" of their state policy.

declaring that india will play an active and positive role in the global war against terrorism, he said new delhi was ""legitimately satisfied"" with its diplomatic efforts in the past two months which have found support among almost all countries.

he said during his recent visit to russia, us and the uk, india''s principled stand on terrorism and religious extremism was ""high appreciated"" by the leaderships of these countries.

""major nations around the world have acknowledged --some of them for the first time-- that there cannot be double standards in identifying and tackling terrorism,"" he said, adding ""the self-evident truth that terrorism and killing of innocent people cannot be justified on any political, ideological or religious grounds has now become evident even to those who earlier preferred either to ignore it or to rationalise it"".

dwelling on india''s diplomatic campaign following the september 11 attacks in the us and the ""inseparable linkage"" between internal security concerns and external environment in the region and the world, he told the conference that ""our foreign policy has always been a product of national consensus.

""you will agree that the time has come to similarly make even our policy on internal security a matter of national consensus,"" vajpayee said.

referring to prevention of terrorism ordinance (poto) which has been strongly resisted by opposition parties, he said, ""the circumstances that have compelled us to bring in this legal instrument are well known to you. we have held consultations with the state governments and the law commission before taking the step.""

stressing the need for a free and frank debate on the proposed statute, vajpayee said, ""we have also taken care to remove the shortcomings in tada, which lapsed some years ago without a successor anti-terrorism law"". recalling his appeal for a consensus on poto at the inter-state council meeting on friday, vajpayee told the chief ministers that he had the ""fullest confidence that you will give your studied views on this ordinance consistent with your own assessment of nation''s security needs"".

delivering his address, home minister l k advani asserted that poto was a ""comprehensive legislation"" against terrorism taking cognizance of terrorist act, terrorist organisations and financing of terrorism.

""provisions and penalties in a law directed against terrorism are bound to be harsh. yet, the ordinance provides suitable safeguards in respect of investigation, arrest, interrogation, trial and other related matters,"" advani said, hoping the state governments would take necessary steps to make use of the ordinance to quell terrorism and terrorist activities in their respective jurisdictions.

besides almost all chief ministers and union territory administrators, the conference, organised by the home ministry, is being attended by defence minister george fernandes, law minister arun jaitley and planning commission deputy chairman k c pant.

observing that the centre had come across a number of cases where conspiracies for terrorist action had spread across a number of states, vajpayee said, ""although discussions on this were initiated a year back, we do not as yet have any agency in place, which can take on and pursue such cases on its own.

""until we have such a federal agency, the key to success will be cooperation and timely exchange of intelligence between the centre and the states and among states themselves,"" he said.

11,Gujarat in favour of terror law,"new delhi: gujarat on saturday came out strongly in favour of poto saying attempts for providing necessary legal frameworks for facing deep-rooted terrorist threats should ""not be clouded by ill-conceived and misplaced imaginary fears about encroachment of individual liberties"". ""the fears about misuse of poto are misplaced. wiser from the experience of tada, adequate safeguards have been built into the new legislation"", state chief minister narendra modi said addressing the conference of chief ministers on internal security. stating that the constitution had provided adequate safeguards for the protection of fundamental rights, he said, ""any weapon can be misused when it falls into bad hands. if a policeman misuses a weapon, you do not disarm the whole police force. you hold him accountable and punish him"". in an obvious dig at the congress, which is staunchly opposing poto, he said ""emergency provisions were misused. but we did not scrap them from the constitution. those who misused them were held accountable by the voters and made to pay the price"". appealing to other states to show ""statesmanship"" by supporting the legislation, he said those leading the battle against terrorists from the front needed a psychological reassurance that the entire country was behind them. he said gujarat supported the ideal of setting up a federal agency for dealing with crimes against the nation. he said ""taking a leaf from maharashtra"", the state was finalising legislation for combating organised crime.

""we are satisfied that the war in afghanistan is now showing all signs of coming to an early and successful conclusion. the taliban are on the run from city after city in afghanistan,"" he told the day-long chief ministers' conference on internal security organised by the home ministry. the prime minister said the united nations was actively trying to put in place a stable, broad-based and representative administration in that country. ""india will play an active and positive role in this endeavour."" he said, ""the audacious nature of the terrorist attacks on september 11 made it inescapable for the us to launch, within the framework of an international coalition, an offensive against al-qaeda and the taliban regime in afghanistan. ""we in india support this war not only out of a sense of solidarity with the international resolve, but also because of our firm belief that the defeat of the taliban and dismantling of the al-qaeda network is in our own vital national interest"". the meeting was attended by home minister l k advani, defence minister george fernandes, planning commission deputy chairman k c pant, law minister arun jaitley, most chief ministers and union territory administrators.

''if at all a new piece of legislation has to be enacted, it has to go through a process of wider consultation with the states'', gogoi, who is a congress chief minister, said. congress has already come out in strong opposition of poto.

""safe drinking water, firewood and education should be the top priority. these are the three main issues, rest is window-dressing,"" observes entrepreneur-cum-management guru, gautam mukherjee. ""the government must provide safe drinking water in all the villages. the rural populace should have firewood. the dropout rates for boys and girls in the tribal areas of the state are 87 per cent and 82 per cent respectively,"" mukherjee points out and adds: ""education is the most potent weapon to battle corruption and bureaucratic apathy"". mukherjee is a member of the xlri's team preparing the vision for the state for the planning commission. ""the marandi government has formulated a very good industrial policy. the decision on unbundling of the power sector is also a step in the right direction. power is the biggest enabler for industrialisation,"" he says. some, however, feel the bjp-led government has ""squandered"" the first year. ""i see no change after the creation of jharkhand. laloo's bihar appears better than marandi's jharkhand,"" says social activist dinesh mishra. the law and order situation has not improved in the state and a bus is looted on ranchi-patna highway almost everyday, he says. the politicians and the bureaucrats, mishra asserts, have not learnt from their previous mistakes.

18,Jharkhand to amend labour laws for industrial growth,"jamshedpur: the jharkhand government has decided to rewrite its labour laws to facilitate industrial growth in the state. the labour ministry has commissioned the xavier labour relation institute (xlri) here to suggest amendments in the archaic industrial dispute act and the trade union act. the xlri is expected to submit its report early next year. another committee of officials from the labour department has also been set up to recommend changes in the labour laws, labour minister, raghuwar das, informed here on friday. ""we hope to table the bill on trade union act during the budget session of the state assembly next year"". major industrial bodies, including the state chapter of the confederation of indian industries (cii), have been demanding reforms in the labour sector. they have claimed the move would boost industrial development in the state. das, however, assured interest of the workmen would not be compromised in rewriting the labour laws. ""our aim is to simplify the rules and make them more effective. the changes would be in line of gujarat, maharashtra and west bengal"". the minister said the government would make the trade union act more stringent to check the mushrooming of unions. the labour ministry has decided to adopt the second labour commission's recommendation on formation of unions. the panel has suggested support of at least 10 per cent of the employees was necessary to set up a union in a factory. ""earlier, one needed just seven people to form a union. we have had cases when seven members of a family have got together and formed a tade union,"" das pointed out. the ailing public sector undertaking heavy engineering corporation at ranchi has 33 trade unions for 4,500 employees. another private sector company in the state has one union per nearly 57 employees. ""the larger number of trade unions has not helped the cause of the workers,"" the minister observed. ""it has only resulted in unhealthy practice. there are other problems also. the recognized union of trf here did not have the support of the workers. our intention is to make the trade union more responsible"". the labour ministry has already clipped the wings of its inspectors by imposing restrictions of official inspection. it has also introduced single window system for the i-t companies in the state.

20,Sonia cracks whip over new law,"new delhi: unhappy with the wavering position of some senior leaders on the prevention of terrorism ordinance (poto), congress president sonia gandhi is learnt to have cracked the whip and made it clear to all that they should oppose the proposed anti-terrorism law in strong and unequivocal terms. enunciating the party's position at the special meeting convened at her residence on saturday, sonia told the assembled chief ministers and senior leaders that there was no ambiguity over the party's opposition to the legislation proposed by the bjp-led government. congress sources said the party's official line to ''oppose poto tooth and nail'' was clearly articulated by party spokesperson jaipal reddy at the outset itself. sonia gandhi also stressed that the ordinance needed to be rejected in view of its draconian clauses. liberty and human rights, according to her, could not be compromised with. despite the clear official position, several senior leaders had privately expressed their reservations about opposing poto. apparently, the party president did not take kindly to senior leaders not taking a clear public position and not opposing the bill vociferously enough. on the contrary, an impression had gained ground that the congress was a divided house and that eventually it would settle for a compromise on this issue. the message from 10, janpath on saturday was clear: the party should oppose poto publicly in strong terms and also speak in one voice. it was also indicated that instead of being defensive, the congress should mount an all-out attack against the centre for bringing in this ordinance without consultations and with the express purpose of gaining political mileage in the coming up polls. it was evident that the fatwa had made an impact. all the congres cms attending the inter-state council meeting faithfully parroted the party line with mp chief minister digvijay singh taking the lead.

21,"CMs divided over terror law, Naidu cautious","new delhi: the chief ministers participating in the conference on internal security here were clearly divided on partisan lines — major congress-ruled states opposing poto and the bjp cms pitching for it. tamil nadu's o paneerselvam and andhra pradesh's chandrababu naidu were the only surprises, paneerselvam completely backing poto and naidu calling for safeguards against its misuse. backing poto, paneerselvanm said, ''we find that most of the provisions in poto are milder than those in tada''. pointing out that tamil nadu had suffered terrorism for years, he said even now some terrorist groups, though under check, have the potential to re-surface and indulge in subversive activities.drawing attention to insurgencies in jammu and kashmir and the north-east, paneerselvam said a ''stringent law'' has become essential not only to meet this situation but could not be delayed any further in view of the ''vaccuum caused by the lapse of tada''. naidu defended poto, saying, there is no gainsaying the fact that extraordinary situations require extraordinary solutions. he, however, sought adequate safeguards should be taken up to eliminate the scope for abuse of extraordinary powers vested in law enforcement agencies. he particularly wanted suitable modificiations to the provision of section 3 (8) and section 14 of the ordinance, to protect the freedom of press which is the hallmark of parliamentary democracy. maharashtra chief minister vilasrao deshmukh stressed that poto has been brought by way of an ordinance without any elaborate consultations having been gone through, and called for an all-party meeting to discuss the issue in-depth. during last year's chief ministers' conference, the centre had committed itself to a broad-based consultative process, but instead of completing this process the ordinance was ''all of a sudden'' issued, he noted.the ordinance has ''far-reaching implications'' and ''we are not in a position to support it in its present form'', deshmukh said. he offered support to poto ''if an exercise at arriving at a consensus with all political parties is undertaken even at this late stage''. madhya pradesh cm digvijay singh rejected the poto, stating that instead of enacting a special legislation, provisions in the criminal procedure code, the indian penal code and the evidence act could be suitably amended to combat terrorism. kerala cm a k antony and his west bengal counterpart buddhadeb bhattacharya rejected poto, repudiating the promulgation of the ordinance as anti-people. bjp chief ministers were, predictably, strongly supportive of poto. up's rajnath singh said poto could be an effective weapon to combat and control terrorist activities. if we take action under this act, we can achieve results, he said. pointing to the problem of infiltration across the 550-km indo-nepal border, he said there was an urgent need to keep constant vigil to prevent entry of undesirable elements. gujarat's newly-appointed cm narendra modi, calling for a poto like law, said since tada had lapsed there had been a spurt in terrorist activities. ''it is now a battle between unequals, with the criminals having the upper hand,'' modi said. poto was required to create an operational environment in which security forces could effectively deal with the terrorists, he said.
