2,Magistrate can record accused's statement without arrest: SC,"new delhi: in an important ruling, the supreme court has held that a magistrate, before whom an fir was filed, can record the confessional statement of an accused even if he was not brought before him by police. a bench comprising justice k t thomas and justice r p sethi said in a recent judgment that, ""we have no doubt that an accused person can appear before a magistrate and it is not necessary that such accused should be produced by the police for recording the confession."" however, the court said the magistrate could not record the confessional statement of an accused if the case was not pending before him. ""if the magistrate does not know that he is concerned in a case for which investigation has been commenced under the provisions of the criminal procedure code, it is not permissible for him to record the confession,"" it said. justice thomas, writing the judgment for the bench, said, ""if any person simply barges into the court and demands the magistrate to record his confession as he has committed a cognisable offence, the course open to the magistrate is to inform the police about it."" an accused in a murder case in haryana came to the courtroom on his own, exhibited a knife and wanted the magistrate to record his confession and after the same was recorded, he signed it. the trial court accepted the confessional statement and convicted him. the high court also upheld the conviction.

3,Parliament okays President's rule in Manipur,"new delhi: the parliament on monday approved imposition of president's rule in manipur with the centre expressing its readiness to hold talks with any militant group which abjures violence to strengthen the peace process in the northeast. winding up discussion in the lok sabha on the statutory resolution on the presidential proclamation in manipur, home minister l k advani said that the centre will be happy if the peace process in nagaland was extended to more and more militant organisations in the northeast, including the ulfa. the lok sabha passed the resolution by voice vote, while the rajya sabha has already adopted it. advani said that situation in northeast deteriorated as successive governments instead of emphasising on development merely resorted to political management. ""i hope that further concentration will now be on development."" he said the centre would like that the talks with the nscn(i-m) should be held inside the country instead of a third country as at present. government was ready to even give an assurance of immunity to the leadership of the militant outfit to facilitate talks in india, advani said. despite opposition demand for early elections in manipur, home minister did not give any definite time-frame for dissolution of the assembly maintaining that the same would be done after normalisation of the situation. advani defended government's decision on the issue of extending naga ceasefire without territorial limits saying there was no other way but to change the decision and limiting the truce to nagaland. ""i would be happy the day (nscn-im leader) muivah comes to india. i want the peace process to go forward."" the home minister said the decision was taken after consultations with chief ministers of the northeastern states and imposition of president's rule had nothing to do with the ceasefire. ""we did what we thought was right."" responding to members' queries as to why centre took much time to effect the u-turn, he said it was necessary for the government to hold talks with the nscn (i-m) again (in amsterdam) and to understand its response. government came under opposition attack in lok sabha on its handling of the situation in manipur with the parties saying instability there was due to over ambition of certain nda leaders like george fernandes dethroned from the central ministry and opportunist politics of bjp and samata. besides, they said the centre's extension of area under naga ceasefire brought unrest to the entire north-east and the decision to reverse the move came too late by which time extensive damage to life and property had taken place. parties like the left and tdp, which are fundamentally opposed to article 356, said there was no option but to support president's rule in manipur as a special case in view of political crisis and constitutional failure. the aiadmk and rjd opposed president's rule saying the proclamation under article 356 was not in consonance with the spirit of federal character.

5,3-fold increase in outlay for supply of contraceptives,"new delhi: there has been a more than three-fold increase in the centre's outlay for supply of contraceptives over the last decade, the rajya sabha was informed monday. while the budget for free supply and social marketing of contraceptives in 1991-92 was rs 62.50 crore, it shot up to rs 210 crore in 2000-01, union health and family welfare minister c p thakur said during question hour. he said the percentage of couples covered by various contraceptive methods has increased from 40.6 in 1992-93 to 48.2 in 1998-99. thakur said an integrated and comprehensive programme of reproductive and child health has been launched as part of the national population policy tobring down the present birth rate. polio: the number of confirmed polio cases has been declining steadily over the years - from 1934 cases in 1998 to only 27 cases in 2001 (till july 21), thanks to the pulse polio immunization (ppi) programme, thakur said. he said during 2000, 21 states did not have any fresh polio case. aids: there is no upsurge in the spread of hiv infection in the country as per the sentinel surveillance data, thakur said. he said regular rounds of nation-wide sentinel surveillance was being conducted every year to track hiv infection in the country.",new delhi
6,Govt promises early polls in Manipur,"new delhi: moving to place trouble-torn manipur under president's rule, the centre has promised to hold early elections in the easternmost state. home minister l k advani told the lok sabha on monday that though the nda government was not in favour of resorting to article 356 to dismiss an elected state government, the situation in manipur had left it with no option. he admitted that in the tiny north-eastern state the crisis had been triggered by a breakdown of constitutional machinery. advani made it clear that the centre would like to hold fresh elections in the state within the first six-month term of the central rule. ""we propose to hold elections in manipur as early as possible,"" he said. he said the nda government would not encourage formation of another government reviving the state assembly. the home minister admitted that the situation in manipur had been a negation of the democratic process with large-scale defections making a mockery of the people's verdict. giving an idea of the abnormal situation he mentioned that the last government strangely had the support of 59 mlas in a house of 60. recalling the nda government's two previous decisions to use article 356, advani admitted that while in goa most of the parties had supported the move, in the case of bihar opinion had been divided. the congress, however, squarely blamed the nda government for the turbulent situation in manipur by pointing out that the centre had looked the other way when the koijam government had taken over on the basis of defections. ""compare the the number of mlas the bjp and the samata had when the government fell and when the assembly elections had taken place,"" congress mp santosh mohan dev remarked about the defection game. the centre, he said, could have prevented formation of that government if it had any concern for the democratic norms. quoting statistics, he said that in the past 25 years manipur had seen 29 chief ministers and out of the 60 mlas in the outgoing assembly 48 had changed sides at least five times. he blamed the explosive situation in the state on the ""over ambition"" of samata leader george fernandes.

8,Minister admits suicide by tribal couple after torture,"raipur: a tribal woman, devikibai, and her husband, hira singh dhruv, committed suicide due to torture by the village sarpanch's husband, kashiram patel, at kolar village in abhanpur block of raipur district, home minister nandkumar patel informed the chhatisgarh assembly on monday. replying to a debate on an adjournment motion moved by opposition members on the issue of the torture of the tribal woman, the minister said the woman was publicly humiliated by the villagers on may 29. she committed suicide the next day. the woman's husband was detained by the police for 13 days and not allowed to attend the funeral on the complaint of villagers that he was creating a public nuisance. the husband wrote letters to the chief minister, the state home minister, the district sp and others demanding action against the villagers, responsible for allegedly outraging the modesty of his wife. he waited for one month, but to no avail. then, he too committed suicide. the couple have four children who were denied ex-gratia. the opposition alleged that the culprits were not arrested due to political considerations and that they were protected by tourism minister dhanendra sahu. the police also did not register the complaint of the tribal woman, they alleged. the minister later said that nine persons had been arrested in connection with the incident. the opposition members also claimed that since the state was formed, there had been 188 incidents of violation of the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes protection act.

9,Heated debate over omission of minister's name,"bangalore: an omission of an mla's name for the inauguration of a court building, sparked off a heated debate in the legislative assembly on monday over the powers of the legislators and the judiciary. when araga jnanendra (bjp) alleged that his name was intentionally omitted at a function, the entire opposition was on its feet demanding that speaker m.v. venkatappa find a permanent solution to end this ""insult"" to legislators. ""we cannot tolerate it anymore. this is not the first time that we have been insulted. it is an insult to the house,"" opposition leader jagadish shettar said. members wanted law minister d.b. chandre gowda and social welfare minister kagodu thimmappa to boycott the function because the concerned mla had not been invited. ""it is we who fought with the government for getting the court building for the judiciary. is it fair that they decide not to invite us for the inauguration?"" b. somasekhar (jdu) asked. s. suresh kumar (bjp) said it was unfortunate that members had to fight for their own rights in the house when they should be fighting for people's rights. gowda said the government does not decide who should be included or omitted in the invitation card. ""i fully agree that legislators should not be insulted or ignored. but i am going because they have invited me and not because it will add value to the function. i will convey the feelings of the house to the chief justice."" when the opposition insisted that both the ministers agree not to attend the function or cancel the inauguration, venkatappa said it was a serious issue. he agreed to call a meeting of all floor leaders along with the two ministers to take a decision.

10,Oppn forces govt to make changes in Land Reforms Bill,"bangalore: the entire opposition in the legislative assembly on monday forced the state government to make some crucial changes in the karnataka land reforms (amendment) bill, 2001. the bill seeks to provide for registration of the tenant along with his/her living spouse as joint occupants. members argued that the word ""living"" could be misused, if the husband decides to remarry. the children of the first wife will be left in lurch as they will not have any stake in the property. besides, it might be contrary to the hindu succession act. intervening, law minister d.b. chandre gowda said the main aim of the bill is to see that the land is not disposed off indiscreetly. but when the opposition insisted that the government makes the changes, revenue minister h.c. srikantaiah agreed to examine the suggestions and bring it before the house in a day or two.

11,When ministers shoot their mouths off,"bangalore: can a minister make statements and announcements on subjects which are outside his portfolio? this question was hotly debated in the legislative council on monday when statements of two ministers contradicted each other. the matter started innocuously enough when m.r. tanga (bjp) asked whether the government had sanctioned rs 220 crore for the beautification of gulbarga city, to which urban development minister b.b. chimmanakatti replied in the negative. tanga then drew his attention to a recent news item in which housing minister qamarul islam, who is also district in charge minister for gulbarga, had made a statement to this effect in the presence of chief minister s.m. krishna during a function in the city. annoyed, chimmanakatti retorted: ``there is no such proposal as far as the department is concerned. i cannot be held responsible for somebody else's statement. why don't you ask him instead?'' an amused tanga drew the attention of acting chairman david simeon to the two differing statements and asked: ``could you please tell us if it is all right for a minister to make statements about things unconnected with his ministry?'' simeon directed the question back to the treasury benches and asked senior most minister, social welfare minister kagodu thimmappa, to answer the question, in the absence of house leader h.k. patil. ``any minister can talk about anything which has been decided in the cabinet. however, if anybody says anything which has not been decided, then it could only be a suggestion. in this case however, the government will look into what was said,'' thimmappa assured the house.
