0,Stray incidents in Vadodara,"VADODARA: No major untoward incident was reported in Vadodara barring vandalising of a showroom during the bandh called by the Congress on Friday. Congress workers turned out on the streets in the city in large numbers to enforce the bandh.

As many as 77 workers were arrested by the police in connection with the bandh. These included senior Congress leaders like Dalsukh Prajapati, Maulin Vaishnav, Bhikhabhai Rabari and Stayajit Gaekwad. Shops were open in the morning.

However, the scenario changed by afternoon with the workers taking an aggressive posture and asking business establishments to close down. A showroom in on R C Dutt Road in the Alkapuri area of the city was vandalised after its owner declined to down shutters. All the shops in the area closed soon after the incident.

Workers of the women''s wing of the party were involved in a major confrontation with the city police after they tried to stage a roadblock on the Raopura main road. They had to be physically removed by the police to ease the traffic.

Commissioner of police Sudhir Sinha said a majority of the arrests were made during a roadblock staged by Congress workers in Raopura at about 4 p.m. ""No untoward incident barring damage to buses the previous night was reported in the city,"" he said.

The city police, meanwhile, registered offences in connection with the five incidents of damaging buses in the city. The Sayajigunj police station registered an offence of culpable homicide against those involved in the incident of charring a bus in Pratapgunj.

About Vadodara district, DSP Piyush Patel said, ""The highways were clear and traffic was normal."" Congress workers tried to stage a roadblock in the Karjan town, but met with little success amidst elaborate police arrangements.

Barring stray incidents, the bandh was largely peaceful in the neighbouring districts of Panchmahal, Dahod and Bharuch. Sources in Dahod said an altercation between Congress and BJP workers had led to some tension in the Gandhi Chowk area. Miscreants tried to block the highway near Sukhsar village by felling trees, but traffic was restored soon after removing them. In Panchmahal district, miscreants stoned a bus in Rajgadh village in the morning.

Meanwhile, Vegetable vendors having push-carts made the most out of the bandh. Several big shops in Khanderao and Kadak markets of Vadodara remained closed due to hampering of the wholesale supplies. Cashing in on the crisis, vendors carted their way to every nook and corner of the city in search of prospective buyers.

""I am selling vegetables for a higher price today as there is no stock in the market. You may compare prices anywhere in the city. It will be similar,"" says Jitubhai, a push-cart vendor, selling vegetables near Salatwada.

Almost all vegetables except tomatoes and potatoes were sold at Rs 20 per kiloâ€” almost at double rates.Potatoes and tomatoes were available for Rs 16 per kilo. A majority of traders in Khanderao market expressed displeasure over not getting deliveries. ""We have exhausted our stocks. There has been no delivery of vegetables. Customers are trickling in slowly, but we have nothing to sell,"" laments a vendor Bharatbhai.

8,More riot cases may come in from the cold,"AHMEDABAD: The Best Bakery case promises to open a Pandora''s box in Gujarat with the Supreme Court deciding to monitor all the riot cases, where the NHRC has asked for trials outside the state. This also includes the Godhra carnage in which 59 passengers were burnt alive aboard Sabarmati Express at Godhra on February 27, 2002.

Interestingly, while the Narendra Modi government keenly monitored the Godhra case, by appointing a CBI-returned IPS officer to head its investigation and also a special public prosecutor, the remaining three cases which claimed nearly 170 lives have been pushed to the backburner.

Significantly, a special investigating team (SIT) was appointed for the Godhra case while the Ahmedabad cases (Naroda Patia and Gulbarg Society) are languishing with the crime branch. Also, while the Godhra case used all the tools of scientific investigation to prove the culpability of the accused, no such effort was made in the rest of the cases. Besides, in February this year, the government applied Pota in the Godhra case against all 131 accused and even appointed a Pota court for its trial.

However, despite trials having concluded in some riot cases, there is not a single conviction even after 17 months. Of the 30,000-odd accused arrested so far, 90 per cent are out on bail, including those held in the Naroda-Patia (57 arrested), Chamanpura (around 40 arrested) in Ahmedabad and Sardarpura (55 arrested) in Mehsana.

All the accused in these cases were bailed out, barring a few. The prime accused in the Naroda Patia massacre, Babu Bajrangi, roams freely and claims he was not even in Ahmedabad on the day of the incident. At least three charge sheets have been filed in this case. The Sardarpura case, where 33 persons asphyxiated to death in a room in this village of Mehsana district, which was set on fire by a mob, started off on a positive note with all the accused being arrested, but the case has failed to come up for trial. All the accused have been bailed out.

Following representations against the Mehsana district''s government pleader, Dilip Trivedi, who is also the state general secretary of the VHP, a petition to appoint a special public prosecutor was filed in the Gujarat High Court. The government was directed to take appropriate action so as to increase the confidence of the public in the administration of justice.

In the Gulbarg Society case in Chamanpura, where 39 persons were killed, 40 accused have been arrested. But some survivors have filed a petition in the HC that the accused were not even acknowledged in the FIR.

17,Not enough forces for simultaneous polls: Lyngdoh,"HYDERABAD: Once again turning down the proposal for simultaneous elections to Lok Sabha and Assembly, chief election commissioner J M Lyngdoh has said even if one goes ahead with the plan, it requires an amendment to the Constitution and police from neighbouring Pakistan and Bangladesh to conduct the polls.

""Assuming that one meets even that requirements, we will finally end up with holding sub-standard elections,"" Lyngdoh told reporters on Saturday.

The CEC said a minimum of 400 companies of para-military forces are required for each of the four ''notorious'' states to conduct free and fair elections. ""Surely, we do not have such huge force and we require to borrow the personnel from Pakistan, Bangladesh and other neighbouring countries for the purpose.""

Lyngdoh said availability of electronic voting machines (EVMs) will be another obstacle in holding simultaneous polls. ""As of how, we have nine million EVMs, but we require a minimum of 10 million to toy with any such idea,"" he pointed out.

Refusing to be drawn further into the controversy over the issue, the CEC said the commission''s image had already suffered and that he would not like to drag it. He also did not favour the idea of holding staggered polls in sensitive states.

When asked about the possible dates chosen for holding elections in five states scheduled for November this year, the CEC has merely quipped: ""They will be held before the first week of December."" He also said that the EC had taken note of some holidays coming up in November, and will fix the dates accordingly.

The CEC was all praise for media and said without its support, the commission would not held fair polls in Gujarat and Jammu and Kashmir. ""In fact, the media helped us in meeting the people of communal violence in Gujarat.""

""The government promised to withdraw the draconian Karnataka Sales Tax Amendment Ordinance issued on June 1, 2003. But now, it has been passed in the form a Bill. This move is equivalent to poisoning the entire trade and industry,"" Association for Karnataka Trade and Industry (AKTI) secretary, B K Goyal, said in a statement on Saturday.

19,Oppn campaign politically motivated: Fernandes,"NEW DELHI: The Opposition may have paralysed Parliament functioning for the last two days but Defence Minister George Fernandes is adamant that there is no question of providing the Central Vigilance Commission report on defence deals to the Public Accounts Committee.

""The CVC itself has written it''s a secret report...We have not hidden anything (else) from the PAC,"" said Fernandes, claiming the frequent raising of the so-called ""coffin scam"" by the Opposition was entirely ""politically motivated"".

The PAC on Wednesday expressed its inability to give its findings on the irregularities committed in defence deals during the 1999 Operation Vijay in Kargil because of the defence ministry''s refusal to part with the CVC report.

Fernandes, at a press conference, refused to answer any questions on the PAC controversy but was more than willing to talk about the ""coffin scam"", especially after the Youth Congress'' coffingate rally outside his official residence on Friday.

""I was nowhere in the picture when the Army went through the process of acquiring the aluminium caskets. The purchase was cleared at the level of the defence secretary under his delegated powers,"" he said.

The coffin scam had hit the headlines after the Comptroller and Auditor General report on Operation Vijay was tabled in Parliament in December 2001. The report pointed grave irregularities in the purchase of the caskets from a US firm to transport the mortal remains of soldiers.

Fernandes said the Army had initially wrongly presumed that each casket cost only $172 and weighed 18 kg, when the actual cost was $2,500 and the weight 55 kg. The letter of credit was for 150 caskets and 900 body bags, costing Rs 1.47 crore.

""The first lot of caskets arrived in March 2000. The entire lot was subsequently rejected by the Army during inspection on grounds of being overweight and welded rather than dye-pressed,"" said Fernandes.

""I learnt about the transaction only when the matter was raised in Parliament after the CAG report...following the controversy, the defence ministry made enquiries about the price of the caskets. US military sources have confirmed the cost of each casket is $2,768,"" he added.

The caskets, at present, are lying in Army godowns. ""Personally, I would like the caskets to be taken out and used since the wooden ones used currently leak,"" said Fernandes, adding that there ""was no loss really to the exchequer"" in the whole deal.

The CM categorically asked his party leaders not to encourage political bitterness with the rivals and instead to involve all the people, specially those from the poorer sections in various works of the panchayats.

Aware that partisan attitude of CPM was a major cause for isolation of a section of the rural population from the Left Front, the CM said development would not be possible unless people of all political hues were involved in the process.

CPM state Secretary Anil Biswas said on Saturday that even in Murshidabad and Malda, where the Left Front lost to the Opposition in the Zilla Parishad elections, the CPM would play a constructive role and would help the ruling parties in their developmental activities.

In a six point guideline, placed by Panchayat Minister Surjya Kanta Misra in the meeting, the CPM directed the financially cripple panchayats to give maximum privilege to the poorest section of the people.

To remove opposition from within the a section in the party to foreign aid, the CPM said that there was no need to suffer from an inferiority complex while accepting aid from abroad.

In the guideline, the CPM also said that priority would be given to the spread of education and health facilities in the rural areas. It also suggested formation of self help groups and asked the panchayat office bearers to guide them in catering to the needs of the local markets.

The party would organize general body meetings all over the state to guide the newly elected panchayat functionaries in performing their duties properly. The Left Front would also organize similar meetings with elected representatives of the Left Front.

Addressing the party''s politburo and state executive meeting on Saturday, TDP president N Chandrababu Naidu said that the political situation at national level was signalling the forwarding of general elections by the BJP led NDA government at the centre. According to sources, the TDP president hinting at the elections, said that the TDP would sail along with the BJP in the elections.

Referring to the position of the party, in the event of Assembly elections, Chandrababu Naidu said that the party is in a position to win comfortably in 100 seats. Sources added that the party has to make some changes in the party candidates at 100 other places to ensure their win.

The TDP president asked the party leaders to set the `house in order'' and to quell the dissidence at all levels. He expressed satisfaction over the successful conduct of the Godavari pushkarams and said the government received only 5-7 per cent negative reports on the arrangements at the pushkaram places.

Chandrababu Naidu asked the leaders to make arrangements for shifting the party cadre in 5,700 villages, to the adjoining mandal headquarters, where there is no transmission of Teja TV. The party president would interact with the party cadre at village level on August 11 through the Teja TV.

Later, at a meeting with the party secretaries, Chandrababu Naidu emphasised the role of secretaries and said that they hold more important role in party growth than the district incharges.

24,Trinamul prepared for polls: Mamata,"HALDIA/TAMLUK: Apprehending an early Lok Sabha poll, the Trinamul Congress on Saturday virtually kicked off its election campaign with party chief Mamata Banerjee describing the general election as the semifinal before the final match of Assembly poll, which, she claimed, she would win in 2006.

Addressing a large rally to mark the anniversary of quit India movement here, Mamata urged the people to rock the Left Front government by boycotting the taxes and additional surcharge on electricity bills.

The government has put an additional burden of Rs 1200 crores as tax on the people she said and alleged that the resources had been used to set up a rigging machinery and to unleash terror to defeat the Trinamul during the polls.

Speaking at a parallel rally, Congress chief whip in the Lok Sabha, Priya Ranjan Das Munshi urged the Trinamul to severe ties with BJP-led NDA ""within 24 hours"" and join hands with the Congress. The Trinamul should give up its association with the saffron party, which was out to divide the country, he said.

Mamata, however, launched a scathing attack against the Congress and described it as the stooge of the CPM in West Bengal. ""The Congress in connivance with the CPM had tried to indulge in horse-trading to wean away my MLA. They had conspired to weaken the party but failed,"" she said.

Asserting that her party was prepared for the Lok Sabha polls, Mamata dared the ruling CPM to ensure a free and fair poll. ""We are prepared for general elections whenever it is held. But we want a conducive atmosphere to hold free and fair elections as we feel that with CPM remaining in power, a free poll is a far cry,"" she said.

Insisting that her party was against the Supreme Court''s verdict banning strikes by government employees, Mamata said Trinamul Congress favoured the workers'' right to strike. She, however, criticised the state government saying that it had made several attempts to snatch away the right of launching democratic movements.

The Congress rally at Tamluk, meanwhile, was marred with mudslinging between rival groups with state Congress General Secretary Manas Bhunia heckled by the rival faction. Bhunia''s rally was disturbed by a separate rally at the same location organised by district Congress leader Anil Mudi''s supporters. When Bhunia protested, he was reportedly heckled.

25,Cong silent on cadres linked to Guj riots,"NEW DELHI: The Congress has been going to town over Best Bakery and other instances of the Narendra Modi government''s complicity in the anti-Muslim violence which shook Gujarat last year.

But when it comes to the involvement of its own party cadre in the killings, 10 Janpath maintains a deafening silence. Even when confronted by a long-standing ally from the freedom movement days, the Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind.

According to the JUH, ""most Congress corporators"" and some Congress leaders of Gujarat had actively participated in last year''s riots.

Mahmood As''ad Madani, JUH general secretary told The Times of India: ""We wrote letters to Congress president Sonia Gandhi, gave a list of Congress leaders involved in the riots, asked her to take action against them but to no avail.""

On April 29, 2002, for example, the JUH received a list of 25 Congress leaders from its Gujarat chapter, which was promptly forwarded to her. This included a former Congress minister, a sitting MLA and a former MP.

Then on August 20, Madani reminded Gandhi: ""Similarly our appeal forwarded to you in respect of involvement of Congress MLAs, corporators and workers in Gujarat carnage along with the list of culpable names remains disregarded.""

When contacted by TOI, Ambika Soni, in-charge of Gandhi''s office, said she was not aware of the correspondence. Ahmed Patel, Gandhi''s political secretary, to whom copies were marked by the JUH was not available for comment.

The JUH insists it had accurate information from the ground. For instance, its Gujarat branch had written to the police commissioner of Vadodara city on March 21 that, ""After the Godhra incident an urgent meeting of the activists of the BJP, VHP, RSS and Bajrang Dal was held under the leadership of Yogesh Patel (MLA)... Chinnam Gandhi (Congress corporator)... They had alloted the activists their jobs, they made a plan and instructed the activists to carry out this work without any fear and told them that they would get full support of police officers.""

The Gujarat JUH had mapped the Congress leadership even at the district level. Mehsana and Patan districts'' list has 8 names of Congress leaders including local MP Atmaram Patel as having played a ""negative role."" A fax message sent on May 1 from Mehsana has this against Patel''s coloumn: ""Still has not come to help Muslims; taking sides in favour of a criminal person of Sardarpur and Ladoi village.""

A list of 15 from Anand is headed by a secretary of Gujarat youth Congress. But to be fair to the Congress and the JUH, the report is all praise for the ""positive role"" played by Patan MP Pravin Rashtrapal.

JUH secretary N A Farooqui says: ""The Congress has committed sins of omission and commission during the riots. Former MP Ehsan Jaffri had called up Sonia Gandhi for help. She didn''t take a strong stand in her subsequent visit to Gujarat. The local bodies were mostly headed by the Congress which could have done a lot for relief and rehabilitation, but it was all left to the NGOs.""

Though Farooqui maintains that the JUH ""has not severed its relationship"" with the Congress, the party''s ambivalence has led to debates within the Muslim intelligentsia over which political formation is best placed to defend the country from the danger of communal division.
