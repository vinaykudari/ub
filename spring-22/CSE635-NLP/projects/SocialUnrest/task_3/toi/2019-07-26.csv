1,Common voters' list will be used for all polls: Electoral Officer,"LUCKNOW: As opposed to the earlier practice there would now be a common voters list for the parliamentary, assembly,panchayat and local body polls. The move would entail a saving of Rs 20 crores to the Election Commission besides obviating the common complaint of names missing from one list and being present in another.

Addressing a press conference, chief electoral officer Noor Mohammad said it had been decided at a meeting held between him and the State Election Commissioner AP Singh that the current revised voters list being prepared by the Central Election Commission would also be used for the three-tiered panchayat and local body polls.

He said a recommendation had also been made to the state government to put on hold all transfers till December, when the revised voters list would be completed.

The chief electoral officer said the common voters list would have far reaching consequences in addition to being near fool proof. This was because in panchayat elections involvement of gram pradhans in preparation of the lists was immense as was the case with corporators in the local body polls.With common votersâ€™ list chances of names missing or being deleted would considerably be lessened, he stressed. This would also help in reducing cases of litigation.

Noor Mohammad said the votersâ€™ list would now be prepared in accordance with the house number. The step was being taken following complaints that complete areas had been left out from the list.Currently a one month long review of the voters list was being carried our beginning July 14.

The CEO said that he had recommended to the state government to put on hold all transfers till December as the frequent changes was affecting the exercise being carried out by the Central Election Commission.Till such time as the exercise was underway the DMs, ADMs, SDMs and other district officials were deemed to be on deputation with EC.

2,Panchayat polls to be held under SC order,"LUCKNOW: The State Election Commission has decided to implement the Supreme Courtâ€™s order on electorsâ€™ right to information regarding criminal antecedents, assets and liabilites and educational qualifications of candidates in the local bodies elections (nagar panchayat and gram panchayat polls). The order has already been adopted by the Election Commission of India.

State election commissioner Aprimita Prasad Singh told presspersons that an order implementing the SC directive would be issued within the next 10 days.

In response to a query over the objections being raised by various political parties over the SC order, he said the local bodies polls were not governed by the Peopleâ€™s Representation Act as there was a seperate Act for the local bodies.

Implementation of the SC order, he stressed, could function both ways-it could either lead to concealment of crime or would result in a complete purging of criminals from the electoral fray.

Singh said gram pradhans or would-be contendors for various local bodiesâ€™ posts had voiced concern over the implementation of the order. The views expressed by them ranged from the order being suicidal to their political career to it being unjust in view of the low conviction rate in the state.

Singh said the people who had raised objections had maintained that the maximum number of murders took place during the gram pradhan elections, but only in 5-8 per cent of the cases did any conviction take place. In the light of this to debar people from contesting would mean an end to their political aspirations.

The commissioner said he had heard their viewpoint but stressed that the SC order would be implemented in the case of the local body polls.

Queried if a higher court stayed the punishment of a convict, would he be allowed to contest the polls, Singh maintained a stay on punishment did not mean a stay on conviction. Citing a precedent Singh quoted the 1997 Unnao case where the punishment of a criminal had been stayed by the high court,but he was debarred from contesting on grounds that his conviction had not been stayed.

He also quoted the example of the Tamil Nadu chief minister Jayalalitha and said it was only after the stay on her conviction had been removed that she was allowed to contest the polls.

3,Domicile policy rocks Assembly,"PATNA: The state assembly had to be adjourned till lunch on Thursday due to complete disorder during zero hour as members of various parties were on their feet on various issues. Ruling RJD and Samata Party members disrupted the zero hour in protest against the new domicile policy of the Babulal Marandi government in Jharkhand, forcing adjournment of the House.

As zero hour began, several RJD MLAs, including Jaiprakash Narayan Yadav, Anirudh Prasad alias Sadhu Yadav and Vinod Kumar Yadvendu, started shouting slogans against the Jharkhand government for its new domicile policy. They alleged that an atmosphere of terror prevailed in the state and that the state was going the Assam way. Samata Party MLAs led by Shravan Kumar stormed into the well, demanding withdrawal of the new policy.

They were soon joined in the well of the House by Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) and CPI-ML members, who sat on dharna waving placards demanding four per cent reservation for tribals in the new reservation Bill being brought by the Rabri Devi ministry during the current monsoon session of the state legislature. BJP MLA Prem Kumar and CPI-ML MLAs also trooped into the well, raising local issues relating to floods and drought.

The RJDâ€™s Jaiprakash Narayan Yadav was heard accusing the Babulal Marandi ministry of introducing a discriminatory domicile policy that had created law and order problem in Jharkhand. â€œBiharis are being victimised under the garb of the new policy,â€� Yadav said. As the din continued unabated, presiding member Bhola Prasad Singh adjourned the House till 2 pm.

Meanwhile, the Bihar Peopleâ€™s Party has charged the Babulal Marandi government with trying to divide the people. The party said in a press release issued here on Thursday that Jharkhand was burning due to the domicile policy of the state government.

5,"Power theft a big problem, says minister","PATNA: The state government on Thursday admitted that the stateâ€™s own power generating units had become old and rickety and were not capable of generating power required for the state. Energy minister Shakeel Ahmad Khan, replying a calling attention of the RJDâ€™s Ram Kripal Yadav in the Council, said the government, in the situation, had to depend on the Central sector for regular supply of power.

Khan said the government had allotted Rs 36 crore for the capital maintenance of the first unit of Muzaffarpur thermal power station (MTPS) and the sixth unit of the Barauni thermal power station (BTPS).

On the transmission and distribution (T&D) network, he said it is not able to meet the requirements, and needed expansion and strengthening of its network for whose strengthening the government had prepared a Rs 335 crore project. The plan, to be put into action by the Power Grid Corporation, is likely to be approved by the state cabinet soon, Khan said.

With regard to the rampant power theft, he said that a series of raids had been conducted to arrest the culprits. In 2001-2002, the Bihar State Electricity Board (BSEB) had lodged 2,968 FIRs and arrested 394 suspected people. In the current financial year, the FIRs have been lodged against 478 people of whom 119 people have been arrested. In the last two years, one superintending engineer, 14 executive engineers and 17 assistant engineers have been punished, he added.

The BSEB has invited tenders to purchase 39 essential raw materials for the rural electrification, which has been expedited. Under the accelerated power development programme (APDP), Rs 21.45 crore had been allotted to the BSEB, Khan said.

The government has decided to do cent per cent metering of the Patna Electric Supply Undertaking (Pesu) to check the power theft, and tenders had also been invited for metering system, Khan said, adding that Patnaâ€™s demand for transformers has increased.

6,Communication gap led to violence in Jharkhand,"RANCHI: Communication gap between the government and the officials was the main reason behind the widespread violence in the state on Wednesday. The conflict between the pro and the anti-domicile groups has left the state capital badly bruised and bleeding.There was a huge gap between what was announced as official measures to ensure peace and what actually followed. It was this communication gap which trapped many innocent officers and workers in the whirlpool of violence. Who will now trust the administration? wondered some public sector staff.On the fateful day, chief minister Babulal Marandi left for Deoghar, en route Delhi via Patna, leaving strict instructions for maintaining peace on July 24, the day bandh was called by the pro-domicile groups. His instructions and appeal for peace were faxed to the media centres as well.Marandi's instructions and well-publicised appeal was followed by an equally strong-worded instructions publicised by home secretary Sushma Singh. It was publicised that Singh had faxed messages to commissioners, deputy commissioners and superintendents of police to deal strictly with those indulging in vandalism. The state was divided into three zones, and one zone that included Ranchi was under the command of ADG Rameshwar Oraon.It was also publicised that in Ranchi alone 84 magistrates, 65 sub-inspectors, 34 assistant sub-inspectors, 335 lathi wielding force and 300 armed personnel would be deployed. It was further said that Section 144 will be imposed in the state capital from July 23 midnight to July 24 midnight.However, on the fateful day, it appears, all the instructions remained confined to files and newspapers only. Strangely, neither anyone was arrested in Ranchi nor the officials disclosed the figure of arrests despite the fact that the entire state capital witnessed an orgy of violence. At many places, police preferred to remain a mute spectator.On the contrary, over 300 persons were arrested at places where the bandh was officially reported as peaceful.Even the leaders of the pro-domicile groups had assured the people and the media that the bandh would be peaceful. The pro-domicile supporters were instructed, as publicised, to keep an eye on mischievous elements to shun violence and not to harass mediapersons.

7,Punjab govt muffles every lash of tax-whip,"CHANDIGARH: Is Congress living up to its promise of providing â€˜transparentâ€™ governance in Punjab? It seems not, at least on some fronts.

State finance minister Lal Singh had categorically ruled out imposing the uniform sales tax on pesticides, fertilisers and diesel as it would directly hit farmers.

But weeks later, sales tax has been imposed on fertilisers while that on pesticides has been hiked. As a result, Punjabâ€™s farmers would be burdened to the tune of Rs 100 crore.

Where Lal Singh had assured that Punjab would seek exemption for these items at the high-power committee of finance ministers, the state government has imposed the tax even before the forumâ€™s meeting. Now, indications are that sales tax on diesel, too, is not far away.

This lends weight to former finance minister Kanwaljit Singhâ€™s claim that the state budget â€˜concealedâ€™ the governmentâ€™s real intention of burdening all sections to the tune of Rs 2,895 crore.

The governmentâ€™s intention in keeping the Cabinet decision on imposition of sales tax on fertilisers and pesticides a guarded secret is also open to question.

The press handout issued after the last Cabinet meeting on July 12 made no mention of imposing these taxes although the decision had been taken in that very session.

This attempt to keep the media in the dark, however, proved futile as senior bureaucrats confirmed the decision and it became public the same day.

The government has also not been forthcoming on the expenditure incurred in renovating ministersâ€™ houses. Chief minister Amarinder Singh ducked the issue at a press conference by saying it was â€˜â€˜not muchâ€™â€™ and that the PWD (B&R) minister would furnish details. But the promised details never came out.

Although a legislator sought the same information through a starred question during the budget session, he got no response. Sources say the expenditure on renovating eight ministerial houses, including two occupied by advisers, was approximately Rs 65 lakh.

The figure would have been much higher on account of labour charges if the task of maintaining ministersâ€™ houses had not been transferred to the state government this year and the works had not been executed by PWD and Public Health departments.

While Rs 65 lakh may seem a small figure to ex-royal Amarinder Singh, for the cashstarved state government it is a princely sum. Ironically, the perquisites of former chief ministers, amounting to only Rs 7 lakh per annum, have been abolished as an â€˜austerity measure.â€™

The state has quietly buried some populist welfare measures, like â€˜Shagunâ€™ scheme, under which schedule caste girls below poverty line were given Rs 5,100 on marriage.

The â€˜dalit girl scholarshipâ€™ to contain drop out rate is yet to be paid and the state has little money to disburse pension amongst the over 10 lakh elderly, widows and destitutes. The government continues to be silent, if not secretive, on all these.

8,Ex-minister’s son dies of gunshot injuries,"PANCHKULA: Thirtynine-year-old former Army Captain Ravinder Singh Dhillon, son of former Haryana minister Parsanni Devi, died of a gunshot injury at his Sector 2 residence here late on Wednesday night.

The bullet pierced Dhillonâ€™s chin and went through his head. The gun was licenced in the name of Parsanni Devi.

9,'Inter marks rule to hit rural students hard',"HYDERABAD: The issue of giving weightage to Intermediate scores in the Eamcet is turning controversial with studentsâ€™ unions and government teachersâ€™ associations opposing the move saying that the new system would only benefit corporate colleges.

For, they have better infrastructure and qualified teachers.

Recently, the government mooted the proposal of giving about 25 per cent weightage to Intermediate marks in Eamcet to reduce what it called â€˜ excessive concentrationâ€™ of students on the entrance test.

However, the unions say that the proposed system would put students from the rural areas at a disadvantage, for they would not be able to compete with their urban counterparts.

â€œCorporate colleges dictate terms to the Board of Intermediate Education (BIE) and any such move would result in mass copying. The BIE lacks a mechanism to stop this,â€� M Srinivas, state organising secretary of the Akhila Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad, said.

The Studentsâ€™ Federation of India too is opposed to the weightage proposal. SFI joint secretary K Hari Kishore said the BIE has no control over corporate colleges, which often manipulate allocation of examination centres to suit their students.

The student leaders reminded the administration that no student from government junior colleges in rural areas figured in the list of toppers in the Intermediate examinations in the recent past.

A Rajender Babu, president of Government Junior Colleges Principalsâ€™ Association, too said the move would prove harmful for rural students. â€œThe government colleges face a chronic shortage of staff and have little infrastructure, and these students cannot compete with the well-equipped corporate colleges,â€� he said.

Though the All India Studentsâ€™ Federation (AISF) has welcomed the move, it wanted the government to be cautious in the conduct of Intermediate examinations.

When contacted, Andhra Pradesh State Council for Higher Education chairman Prof C Subba Rao said no decision was taken on according weightage to Intermediate marks in the Eamcet.

10,Chiranjeevi fans run riot in Bellary,"BELLARY: It was midnight madness at Bellary. Diehard fans of Chiranjeevi stormed a theatre in the heart of town on Tuesday midnight for a special screening of Indra , the starâ€™s latest release.

En route, they destroyed a park, uprooting saplings and breaking benches. Giving in to mob mania, the district administration allowed the theatre management to screen the film.

Indra, a Telugu film starring Chiranjeevi, Bollywood starlet Sonali Bendre and Arati Agarwal, was due for a Wednesday morning release across Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh.

But the crowd couldnâ€™t wait the night out for the 9.30 am show at Nataraj theatre at the busy Royal Circle. The prints of Indra had arrived and the fans took up their cause as evening set in, pressuring the theatre management to screen the film at midnight.

Just in case they were not taken seriously, the hooligans also went on the rampage in the newly renovated Narayana Rao Park. The municipality had just taken pains to redo the park, which is waiting to be inaugurated at the month-end.

Chiranjeeviâ€™s fans are desperate for the success of their screen idol, whose films have been bombing continuously at the box office. Their expectations high, some fanatics had poured in from as far as Guntakal, Tadpatri and cities like Kurnool and Anantapur in Andhra Pradesh for the midnight screening.

Vandalism is common in Bellary when releases of superstars are due. In fact, Balakrishna, N.T. Rama Rao, Nagarjuna and Chiranjeeviâ€™s films are known to have sparked off events like the sacrifice of animals. Locals are put to great inconvenience but the police are silent spectators.

On Wednesday, the police went a step ahead, blocking the busy road to the theatre and diverting vehicles to prevent traffic jams. Despite previous experiences, the department utterly failed to take stringent action and crack down on the fans.

Instead, it allowed a special screening. This, despite the Karnataka governmentâ€™s clear directions to theatre managements, restricting them to only four screenings a day. By 6 am on Wednesday, Indra was into its third show, with many more lined up.",BELLARY
11,Protesting farmers lathicharged at Chandragiri,"TIRUPATI: Police fired tear gas shells at agitating farmers in Chandragiri after they blocked roads and held a dharna at the Transmission Corporation of Andhra Pradesh office for more than seven hours on Thursday.

Chandragiri is the home town of chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu.

The dharna was held in protest against the irregular power supply and forcible collection of dues by Transco officials.

The farmers squatted on the the national highway between Tirupati and Chittoor from 9 am till 4 pm bringing all vehicular movement to a standstill.

Senior police officials and APTransco officials tried in vain to convince the agitating farmers. When senior police officials tried to divert traffic through the bypass road, the farmers shifted their rasta roko to Ayithapalli, 5 km away from Chandragiri, forcing the traffic to a grinding halt.

Additional police forces that were rushed to Chandragiri to control the situation immediately tried to vacate the farmers.

The farmers reacted by pelting stones and empty bottles at the police which resulted in a lathicharge by the police.

ITC Chairman Y Deveshwar after announcing the result said the cigarette industry continues to be under pressure in the wake of fresh state level taxes and growing menace of contraband.

He said significant growth in operating profits of the agri business and paper board segments has additionally boosted the earning for the quarter.

ITC Spokesperson H S Venkatramani said these earnings were achieved despite difficult trading conditions.

Commenting on the other businesses of the company, Ventakramani said the lifestyle retailing business scaled up operations by adding seven more exclusive Wills Life Style stores during the quarter.

Greeting card business continues to capture the market share gaining three percentage points in the quarter. About their hotel business, he said the incipient recovery in the first two months of the current financial year was neutralised in the wake of negative travel advisories issued by most western countries.

Plans are underway to realise synergies and envisage the amalgamation of the paper board business.

The agri business turned in a sterling performance with export growing 109 per cent to Rs 269 crore.

Coming back to the financial performance, he said total expenditure shot up by 29.36 per cent to Rs 839.57 crore from Rs 649.02 crore last fiscal mainly due to sharp increase in staff costs and other expenditure.

Of the total gross income of Rs 2747.78 crore, revenue from cigarette amounted to Rs 2204.85 crore against Rs 2001.72 crore.

14,BJP rejects Oppn demand for President's rule in Gujarat,"CHENNAI: The BJP on Friday rejected the Opposition demand for imposition of President''s rule in Gujarat prior to Assembly polls, saying normalcy had returned to the state.

""There is no need for President''s rule in Gujarat as normalcy has returned in the state,"" BJP President M Venkaiah Naidu said at a press conference here.

Rejecting the demand for postponing Assembly polls, he said, ""The Opposition has no moral courage to face the people and democracy cannot be suspended for this.""

The Opposition, by seeking postponement of polls and imposition of President''s rule, was only ""vitiating"" the atmosphere in Gujarat, he added.

Naidu said that three months ago, when Gujarat was under communal tension, the Opposition demanded Chief Minister Narendra Modi''s ouster and fresh polls in the state.

It was surprising, he said that the Opposition was not favouring polls now when the state was ""free from communal clashes"".

Denying that the BJP was ""pressurising"" the Election Commission for early polls, Naidu said he had called on the Chief Election Commissioner at New Delhi recently to put forth his party''s views.

He was compelled to do so as other parties had called on the CEC requesting him not to hold polls in Gujarat, he said.

The BJP president said the governor had accepted Gujarat Cabinet''s recommendation for dissolution of Assembly and as per Article 174 of the Constitution, the Assembly had to meet within six months from last day of last session.

The EC has ""no other way but to hold elections there"", he said.

16,Bar owner’s protest an eyewash: Police,"MUMBAI: Police Commissioner M.N. Singh dismissed bar owner Manjit Singhâ€™s indefinite hunger strike to protest against â€˜police harassmentâ€™ as an eyewash.

President of Fight for Rights, a bar ownersâ€™ association, Manjit Singh is protesting against the increase in haftas (bribes) demanded by policemen in the western suburbs, between Oshiwara and Dahisar.

He is on a hunger strike outside his restaurant, Golden Bowl, in Malad (West), and has demanded the transfer of regional additional police commissioner Madhu Shinde. Speaking to this correspondent on Friday, the commissioner pointed out that owners of several restaurants and bars between Oshiwara and Dahisar were not supporting Manjit Singh.

â€œThese bar owners met me recently and complimented our department staff for cracking down on illegal liquor bars in the western suburbs. They were shocked when they learnt about allegations levelled by Manjit Singh.â€™â€™

The police chief further said, â€œWhy is he protesting only against an increase in haftas? It means he is admitting that bar owners pay haftas to policemen. But why pay haftas at all? They can get the policemen trapped with the help of anti-corruption bureau or give specific complaints to me. But there is no protest against abolition of hafta system. This is because bar owners offer haftas to certain policemen to cover up their nefarious activities.

In fact, they have encouraged corruption in the police system.â€™â€™According to the police chief, Mr Shinde had conducted more than 255 raids on liquor bars in his jurisdiction in the past few months. â€œThis has upset a certain lobby among bar owners who want to get rid of him,â€™â€™ he said.

Mr Singh said he had ordered a crackdown on illegal liquor bars. Of the 400 bars having dancing girls, 131 are unauthorised, the commissioner said. â€œWe had taken action against these bar owners but they managed to obtain a stay order from court. We are now reviewing licences of the 131 bars. We plan to shut down 69 of them in the next few days.â€™â€™

The police chief added, â€œSeveral illegal bars double up as pick-up joints. It is a social menace and will be tackled on a war footing.â€™â€™ At a meeting, he had directed the five regional additional commissioners and 14 zonal dy commissioners to conduct frequent raids on illegal bars and take stringent action.

18,"Perform or lose pay hike, govt school heads told","BANGALORE: In a sweeping decision, the education department has decided to cut increments to heads of government schools which have obtained less than 20 per cent results in the SSLC examination.

Over the last few years, the department had adopted a pro-active approach towards schools which secured poor results. It had directed department officials to adopt schools with poor pass percentage and attach special importance to teaching and learning in such schools. This is the first time it has decided to punish heads and teachers for non-performance.

The department has identified 1,500 government and 750 private schools which have registered 20 per cent to 30 per cent results. Warnings will be issued to schools which obtain less than 30 per cent results.

Confirming the decision, Commissioner for Public Instruction T.M. Vijayabhaskar told The Times of India that one increment each would be cut for last year''s (2001) and this year''s (2002) poor showing.

``We will not take action against all schools. If schools have vacant posts or poor infrastructure, they will definitely be exempted. However, if schools continue to show poor results without any justifiable reason, they will definitely be punished,'''' he said.

Private schools will not be spared either. The department will review financial aid for aided schools and consider derecognising unaided schools which post poor results.

Justifying the decision, Vijayabhaskar said the department was not expecting government schools to show outstanding results but minimum results of 20 per cent. ``We are only trying to instil accountability among teachers. Accountability and performance have become part of public management -- both in the government and corporate sectors -- all over the world. Is it too difficult for teachers and heads to show 20 per cent results?'''' he asked.

However, teachers and heads are not impressed. ``Let the government first provide infrastructure to schools and fill government posts. If schools don''t improve their performance after providing these, then they are welcome to take action. But not when government schools are ill-equipped,'''' a teacher said.Another headmaster said: ``The department cannot hold teachers alone responsible for poor results. There are many factors, including disinterested children, parents, poor infrastructure and teacher-less schools which contribute to poor performance. It is unfortunate that teachers are being singled out.''''

19,Dalit leader's murder in Bidadi sparks violence,"BANGALORE: A Dalit Sangharsha Samiti (DSS) leader was murdered over a land dispute in Bidadi on Friday, igniting communal tension in the town and surrounding areas of Bangalore district.

MC Kailash was found hacked to death in the fields near Doddabele on the Bangalore-Mysore highway, by a gang said to be led by Narayanappa (a Vokkaliga), his brothers Shekhar Budha and Token Ravi. In retaliation, Kailash''s brother Palaksha and some others went on the rampage, ransacking the houses of Narayanappa''s followers. A dalit woman Lakshmamma sustained head injuries, and died at Nimhans where she was shifted. Three others were injured.

Senior police officers, including Bangalore District SP Bhaskar Rao accompanied by five platoons of KSRP and four platoons of the District Armed Reserve police, are camping at Bidadi.

The murder and counter-attack has created a rift between two groups of Dalits, and also between Dalits and Vokkaligas in Bidadi and Kengeri areas. Traffic between Bangalore and Mysore also suffered for a while.

Background: Narayanappa and Venkate Gowda, residents of Doddabele, had been illegally cultivating over 25 acres of government land on the Bangalore-Mysore highway near Doddabele. Kailash, a local leader, detected this and moved court, requesting that the government take over the land.

The court directed the government to find out who is the real land owner was and take it back from Narayanappa and Venkate Gowda, if it belonged to the government.

Kailash then formed a layout here and began distributing sites for a price. Some members of the dalit community did not like this and formed a group called Dalit Maha Sabha to oppose the sale of sites.

Meanwhile, animosity developed between Narayanappa and Kailash. Kailash sought police protection, fearing for his life, and was given a gunman. ""He misused the gunman and intimidated his adversaries through him. The gunman was withdrawn after he was sent to jail in a case,"" the police said.

Kailash returned from jail 10 days ago and again sought police protection. ""His security was reviewed on Thursday and orders were issued to give him a gunman from Friday. But he was murdered,"" SP Bhaskar Rao said.

Tension is expected to escalate during the cremation of Kailash''s body. Police have made elaborate security arrangements to meet the situation.

Police registered a case of murder against Narayanappa and his followers.

Kailash''s family members have blamed the local police for the murder and resulting tension. ""Had they provided a gunman to Kailash after he came out of jail, his murder could have been avoided. Police officials took their own time to review the threat, and by the time it was decided to provide security, he was murdered,"" said Ranga, his relative.

""We see a political hand in the delay in providing security to Kailash and in his murder. He had helped the government take back 25 acres of prime land and distribute it among the landless. This is the reason for his murder and we demand a judicial inquiry into the episode. We do not have faith in the local police, who have become agents of Kailash''s enemies,"" DSS workers said.

They demanded compensation for Kailash''s family, and that Narayanappa and others be immediately arrested. They also want the government to allot the land to the poor, as desired by Kailash.

20,Mandal ghost haunts Jharkhand unrest,"NEW DELHI: The BJP central leadership, it is learnt, is fully backing Jharkhand Chief Minister Babulal Marandi on the domicile issue as it feels it could benefit it electorally, even though the current anti-domicile agitation has seen a spate of bandhs, violence and deaths. A central team consisting of senior central leaders Kailashpati Mishra and Devdas Apte is being despatched to Ranchi on Saturday to help Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani make a statement on the subject in the Lok Sabha next week.BJP leaders say those most affected by the government notification are Biharis, not Jharkhandis, ''Earlier, Bhoomihars and Rajputs from north Bihar would come south for these Class III and Class IV jobs. The government notification has existed from 1981, but before the new state came into existence, the domicile clause did not affect them. The point about creating a new state was that locals should benefit and that is what this notification does. It is not a fresh notification; when the state was created and jobs were advertised, the old notification was pulled out and Jharkhand was substituted for Bihar. So a young man from Bihar who applied for a job and was refused on the ground that he was not domiciled in Jharkhand went to court. That was the start of the agitation.''This reading was borne out by the fact that senior central leaders, both from the ruling Samata Party and opposition Rashtriya Janata Dal from Bihar, said that the domicile policy was ''unconstitutional'' and that if it was not dropped, it would have serious repercussions, and that it could not be compared to Mandal as that had constitutional sanction.For Marandi, the agitation has come as a shot in the arm as the central leadership is backing the domicile policy. Earlier, there had been talk of replacing Marandi as he had become a controversial figure in the state, and his administration left a lot to be desired.Related Stories:",NEW DELHI
