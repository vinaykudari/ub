0,"PCCTU bandh call supported by Chd, Punjab federation","CHANDIGARH: The Punjab and Chandigarh College Teachers Union call for ""mass casual leave and total education bandh"" on January 21 is being supported by the â€˜Federation of Associations of Principals of Nongovernment Affiliated Colleges of Punjab and Chandigarh''.

In a statement issued to the Press, on Sunday, federation general secretary P S Sangha has said that all the principals would participate in the bandh.

The college teachers union has decided to hold a rally here to protest the ""anti-higher education policies of Punjab government"".

""The non-government colleges of Punjab are facing acute financial crunch because of irregular and inadequate release of grants. Despite its repeated assurances to retain the scheme of 95 per cent deficit grant-in-aid, Punjab government is following the policy of reducing it by 10 per cent every year. The present level of grant has come down to Rs 56 crore per annum against Rs 102 crore as per the 95 per cent grant-inaid scheme. In case the government does not review this policy, majority of the nongovernment colleges would be left with no option but to close down,"" observed Sangha.

He urged the Punjab government to fulfil its commitment and restore 95 per cent grant-in-aid in its original form, implement Pension Cum Gratuity Act and also release the grant withheld for last five years.

""The colleges are in the process of getting accredited by NAAC wherein regular salaries to the staff is a major parameter of assessment.

These colleges might fail to get a good grade from NAAC owing to the non-payment of salary on regular basis,"" he said.

He has sought immediate intervention of chief minister Amarinder Singh and ""save higher education in Punjab"".

1,Pawar rules out split in NCP,"THANE: Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar on Sunday ruled out a spilt in his party following P.A. Sangma''s opposition to an alliance with the Congress in the forthcoming Lok Sabha elections.

Mr Pawar was reacting to Mr Sangma''s suggestion asking him to leave the NCP and join the Congress and also to his threat of approaching the Election Commission to stake claim over the NCP.

""I would not like to aggravate the situation,"" the NCP president said. ""What I need is an amicable solution and I am confident of resolving the issue,"" he said.

Referring to the political alliance between like-minded parties, including the NCP and the Congress, Mr Pawar said the idea had been originally mooted by a resolution in May 2003 by Mr Sangma himself.

""After this resolution was passed, I had meetings with Congress chief Sonia Gandhi and Congress leader Manmohan Singh,"" Mr Pawar said.

The NCP has given a list of probable candidates to fight the forthcoming Lok Sabha polls to Mr Singh and this would be discussed in the Congress committee meeting soon, he added.

Mr Pawar criticised the NDA government for giving step-motherly treatment to Maharashtra while disbursing funds for drought relief.

He lauded Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray for demanding Rs 2,000 crore from the Centre for drought relief. ""Certain issues are above politics and we support the Shiv Sena chief on this particular issue,"" he said.

2,Hawkers press for govt recognition,"PUNE: It is high time street vendors got their due recognition from the government, said R.B. Sharmale, president of the Maharashtra Hind Mazdoor Sabha, speaking at a convention on â€˜The basic rights of hawkersâ€™.

He was speaking at a firstof-its-kind two-day national hawkersâ€™ convention here, which opened on Sunday. Everything from hawking rights, police extortion, trade licences and traffic planning, was discussed.

""We plan to form registered societies and co-operatives of hawkers and street vendors. Once these are formed, we will get easy finance at low interest rates from government-funding agencies,"" Sharmale said.

Some 400-odd delegates from 300 hawkersâ€™ unions across the country gathered at the inaugural function, where they highlighted their basic demands and woes. Also present was social activist Baba Adhav,who said it was high time the government recognised street vendors as an intricate part of the trade circuit in the country.

""Nobody has the right to shun vendors and deprive them of earning their daily bread.We have to make a collective effort and demand our rights from the government,"" Adhav said.

Sharmale, an organising committee member of the National Alliance of Street Vendors, India (NASVI), which organised the event, brought up the issue of civic responsibilities.

""We have to educate street vendors and hawkers to abide by the law and work with the traffic police and civic authorities to avoid creating traffic snarls and a garbage menace on the streets,"" he said.

Dheeraj Makhamale, vicepresident of the Maharashtra Vyavasaik Sanghatana, said plans were afoot to submit a detailed proposal to the government, regarding the housing schemes and rehabilitation of street vendors.

More often than not, vendors have to put up with harassment from local goons and the police. We are always on tenterhooks, as both parties extort money from us,"" Makhamale said.

Sharmale added that the organisations would be submitting a detailed letter of their demands to the state and central governments.

3,CM rejects Hazare plea to sack two senior ministers,"MUMBAI: Chief Minister Sushilkumar Shinde on Sunday rejected social activist Anna Hazare''s demand for sacking senior ministers Suresh Jain and Padamsinh Patil from his ministry.

Mr Hazare recently demanded the removal of these ministers on the ground of alleged corruption and announced his plan to go on an indefinite hunger strike from January 26 to press his demand.

""At Mr Hazare''s insistence, I had set up the Justice Sawant committee to probe the charges against the ministers concerned. I cannot be expected to take action against the ministers even before the Sawant panel submitted its report. If the panel is taking time to finalise its report I cannot be held responsible for that,"" Mr Shinde, who completed one year in office on Sunday, told Times News Network.

""I appeal to Mr Hazare to be patient and await the committee''s report,"" he added.

The government had already issued an ordinance governing postings and transfers of government officials and the Right to Information Act was also in place. These were the demands mooted by Mr Hazare, he noted.

Mr Shinde also defended his decision not to hold the assembly elections along with the Lok Sabha polls.He said the parliamentary polls were being held earlier on political considerations.

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) felt that after its victory in Rajasthan and a few other states it would be able to win the Lok Sabha polls also, he said.

""Why should I hold the assembly polls to suit the BJP''s convenience?"" he asked. Also, several districts in the state were facing severe drought.

Mr Shinde said his government had spent Rs 900 crore on drought relief so far and had sought central assistance four months ago. The Centre had toured the affected areas about a month-and-a-half ago, but no assistance reached the state so far.

He said it was because of this compulsion that his government was forced to seek an overdraft of Rs 20 crore from the Reserve Bank of India recently.

He noted that following a series of steps taken by his government, the state''s indebtedness had come down by Rs 3,000 crore to Rs 90,000 crore. He said efforts to restart Phase I of the Enron power project would bear fruit within six months.

""The plant needs to be run soon otherwise it will bec o m e junk. Litigation is pending in the US and the UK, nevertheless we are trying to resolve the issue as quickly as possible,"" he added.

He said the work on the Bandra-Worli sea link had stopped since the contractor, Hindustan Construction Corporation, had taken the government to court.

Referring to the appointment of a new municipal commissioner for Mumbai in the place of Karun Srivastava,who is retiring next month-end, Mr Shinde said, ""I assure the people of Mumbai that the next commissioner will be a dynamic person. I will not let considerations of seniority come in the way of appointing a dynamic commissioner.Mumbai''s problems are vast and need to be tackled on a priority basis.""

Mr Shinde noted that he had led an allparty team to Delhi to demand Rs 18,000 crore from the Centre, exclusively for Mumbai''s development. ""The Centre did not give us a single paise,"" he added.

4,Is the law being fair to the rich and famous?,"NEW DELHI: Equality before the law is considered a fundamental attribute of democracy, but the lack of that equality remains manifest in India.

In many countries, the high and mighty seem to get preferential treatment from the legal system. In recent times in India, however, there is a remarkable new phenomenon â€” those considered rich and powerful seem to be getting the short end of the stick.

Take for instance, Bollywood actor Salman Khan who was rightly arrested in a rash and negligent driving case for allegedly killing one person and injuring a few others as he drove over them in his speeding SUV.

He was arrested, interrogated in police custody and later sent to jail custody. He got bail. However, the police in their wisdom want to charge him with â€œculpable homicide not amounting to murderâ€�, providing a maximum of 10 years in jail and not for rash and negligent driving which is merely a bailable offence.

Recently in Delhi, two youngsters, who were also drunk, smashed two autorickshaws while driving their fatherâ€™s limousine at high speed, killing at least two persons and injuring a few others.

They were granted bail within hours, no questions asked. There are no number of cases of non-celebrities who kill people through rash and negligent driving, and yet they are never treated as harshly as Salman.

Almost all public transport drivers who are so charged, too, seem to get this deluxe treatment.

Take another example. Noted Punjabi pop singer Daler Mehndi hit the headlines as the Punjab police claimed he was involved in a serious human trafficking case.

He ran to the courts for relief, was later arrested, interrogated and summoned for further inquiries. Daler had said the police demanded Rs 1.5 crore to clear him of the charge.

On the courtâ€™s order, he surrendered for questioning. Later, the police, which had already registered a few cases against him, said Daler was not involved in the case.

Daler must be relieved, but wasnâ€™t he made to suffer by the police because he was a celebrity? Is there a remedy in any law for Daler to get speedy redressal of his grievance about prolonged harassment and loss of reputation?

The legislature and the judiciary have to ensure that the law must take that course which is permissible under the Constitution and established law, or lawlessness would continue to haunt the system.

There has been a demand for making rash and negligent driving a serious non-bailable offence, attracting severe punishment and fine.

But lawmakers have ignored the issue though the number of persons killed in road accidents across the country has been increasing every day. If that be the situation, could the offence be treated differently by the police?

Is it not the right time to enact an appropriate law by which victims of crime as well as those adversely affected by State action can claim speedy and exemplary damages?

5,Environment policy draft by month-end,"NEW DELHI: New environment minister Ramesh Bais has promised to speed up a comprehensive review of policies and finally table the draft of a long-awaited environment policy by the month-end.

The minister, who formally took charge on Thursday, acknowledged that there is, in effect, no environment policy. What he did not say is that the policy isnâ€™t being drafted by ministry officials but by The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI).

Surprising as this may seem, officials say the draft will be up on the web and circulated for comments from all stakeholdersâ€” other Central ministries, states, experts and NGOs. It is expected to be fully ready by May.

With elections looming, the minister has little time to make an impact but he wants a policy which will combine environment protection with the development imperative.

If this politician from Chhattisgarh feels a lot of state forest work is pending, he also announced his ministry would review forest diversion clearance procedures and streamline the process for regularising pre-1980 encroachments, settlement of tribal claims and conversion of forest villages into revenue villages.

6,No simultaneous polls: Shinde,"MUMBAI: Chief minister Sushilkumar Shinde categorically ruled out dissolution of the state legislative assembly to hold simultaneous elections for the assembly and the Lok Sabha.

He made this clear at a high-level meeting of the Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee (MPCC) at Tilak Bhavan on Saturday.

Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray had on Friday demanded simultaneous elections to the Lok Sabha and the assembly.

Mr Shinde said the state legislative assembly elections would be held as per schedule in September. The MPCC also chalked out a programme for shortlisting candidates for the Lok Sabha elections. The last date for filing of forms with the District Congress Committee is January 25.

AICC general secretary Vayalar Ravi and MPCC president Ranjit Deshmukh told mediapersons that the party was in the process of talks with other smaller partners of the Democratic Front government along with the Sharad Pawar-led NCP for a tie-up in the Lok Sabha elections.

Mr Ravi declined to comment on the talks with Mr Pawar. ""I can tell you that we are on the right track and we will be fighting the Lok Sabha election in Maharashtra as a front.""

Mr Deshmukh said the details of seat-sharing would be worked out with the NCP and other parties soon.

""We will be submitting our recommendations to the AICC high command which is holding talks with the NCP at the national level,"" he said.

7,Receivers twist the law and roam free,"HYDERABAD: The provision of habeas corpus in the Indian law system has turned into a weapon for those who purchase stolen gold and silver jewellery.

Such people â€” better known as receivers in the crime world â€” are getting away with their illegal activity with the help of the habeas corpus.

A habeas corpus is filed by the kin of a person whenever he is taken into police custody, seeking his immediate production before the court. The police is directed to produce the person in custody before the court.

Taking advantage of this provision, the receivers escape the clutches of the police within no time, thereby making the task of the police in recovering the stolen jewellery even more difficult.

According to statistics available with the central crime station, the recovery rate of stolen jewellery was a mere 26.79 per cent in 2003.

Gold and silver jewellery worth Rs 6.7 crore was stolen during the year.

In 2002, jewellery worth Rs 3.29 crore was stolen and the recovery rate was 21.89 per cent.

It is clear from the statistics that the percentage of recovery has not increased proportionately to the property stolen over the year.

The reason: Earlier, police used to keep the receivers in the lock-up for more than a week for interrogation following which the latter used to spill the beans.

Nowadays, the receivers take advantage of the law and their kin file a habeas corpus the moment a receiver is picked up and securing his release due to which recovery rate has gone down, a police officer said.

""We are producing the accused in the court within 24 hours of arrest as per the law and we are not getting enough time to question the accused in detail due to which some problems are being encountered,"" said deputy commissioner of police (detective department) M Satyanarayana Reddy.

8,City caught in two-wheeler tax protest jam,"KOLKATA: About 2,000 twowheelers jammed the streets from north Kolkataâ€™s Deshbandhu Park to south Kolkataâ€™s Deshapriya Park on Sunday in protest against the exorbitant tax imposed on two wheelers.

West Bengal Two Wheeler Ownersâ€™ Association president Utpal Roy said the government had been fleecing two-wheeler owners even after the court stayed the governmentâ€™s drive.

Roy alleged that every two-wheeler owner had to pay road-tax for 15 years and a life-time tax. On December 31, Justice Pratap Roy stayed the initiative.

Yet the trans-port department continued to receive the life-time tax till January 1 on the pretext of not receiving the court order.

A huge amount was deposited to the governmentâ€™s coffer, as people were apprehensive of penalty. The lifetime tax ranged from Rs 1440 to Rs 3650, depending on the engine capacity. Those who have paid the tax are unlikely to get back the money, two wheeler owners said.

â€œWe demanded immediate refund of the tax illegally collected from the two-wheeler owners,â€� Roy said.

9,LS polls: BJP can't rest on its laurels,"NEW DELHI: The BJP seems to have convinced itself that all is over with the coming Lok Sabha elections, but the celebration. Rushing the goal, as the BJP seems to be doing, is legitimate tactic, but as any footballer knows, it has the attendant risk of leaving oneâ€™s own goal untended.

The political feel-good factor is the result of the partyâ€™s victory in three of the four state assembly elections in December 2003. But a quick look at assembly elections since 1999 shows little room for complacency.

In the February 2000 assembly elections in Bihar, Orissa, Haryana and Manipur, the Congress got a battering.

However, the gainers were not the BJP, but regional actors like Laloo Prasad Yadav, Naveen Patnaik and Om Prakash Chautala.

In the May 2001 assembly elections in Tamil Nadu, Kerala, West Bengal, Assam and Pondicherry, the BJP was not really in the reckoning, and its allies in TN, West Bengal and Assam were routed.

2002 was a mixed year for the party. In the elections at the beginning of the year in Uttar Pradesh, Uttaranchal, Punjab and Manipur, the party got a drubbing.

But subsequently, it did well enough in the Goa elections in May to form a government and swept the Gujarat poll in December through a hopefully one-off event.

The J&K elections were a fiasco with the partyâ€™s confused politics resulting in a setback for its candidates in the Jammu region.

The year 2003, too, was mixed. The BJP did poorly in the February elections and lost Himachal to the Congress. It was not a player in the Meghalaya, Tripura and Nagaland elections.

But later in the year, it managed to win three crucial elections in Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. This led to the call for general elections.

Looked at any way, the BJPâ€™s problem as it goes into the 14th Lok Sabha elections can be summed up in two words: Uttar Pradesh.

The state has as many as 80 Lok Sabha seats of which the BJP won 29 the last time around. The outcome of the 2002 state assembly polls â€” 25 for Congress, 88 for BJP, 98 for BSP and 143 for Samajwadi Party â€” indicated that while the Samajwadi Party gained ground since the October 1999 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP and the BSP had just about retained their position while the Congress had lost ground. But none of them lost or gained enough to affect the gridlock on the states politics.

Through the prism of caste, it appeared that the BJP retained its hold on the upper castes, while the Yadav-Muslim combination worked for the SP. The BSPâ€™s stronghold over the Jatav community, that constitutes 12 per cent of the stateâ€™s dalit population, remained unchanged.

To change things, the BJP needs an alliance. Despite a brief flirtation with the BSP, that does not seem to be happening.

It therefore needs the support of at least some OBCs and dalits, but that seems a distant prospect as long as Kalyan Singh remains aloof.

An unknown factor has now been introduced â€” riots, encouraged not-so-tacitly by the BJP and the BSP against the decision to undo the formation of a number of new districts.

10,Thakur offers to quit politics if proved guilty,"PATNA: The union small scale industries minister C P Thakur on Monday offered to quit politics if the CBI inquiry proved that he and his two sons were in any way involved in the drug purchase racket under central government health scheme(CHGS) during his tenure as health minister.

Talking to mediapersons at the BJP headquarters, Thakur dared the RJD supremo Laloo Prasad Yadav to substantiate his charge that he had and his relatives were involved in the drug purchase scandal or quit politics.

""On various occasions in the past too Laloo implicated me in cases of massacres or kidnappings though on none of these occasions he succeeded in his evil design"", Thakur said.

Giving a clean chit to Thakur on the matter, the BJP president Gopal Narayan Singh said that he was not at all in favour of the former clarifying his stand on the matter since the party had complete faith in him. Laloo had got after Thakur since the latter had brought bhumihars votes to the BJP fold, Singh added.

Thakur said that centre purchased medicine under CGHS through medical stores organisation(MSO) which functioned independently under the directorate of health services headed by director general health services.

Generally, he said, the medicine notified under ''formulary'' are to be purchased only from the MSO as the medicine notified under it are available at a rate much lower than the maximum retail price. It is only in emergency cases, Thakur said, that medicine can be procured directly from the chemists.

Thakur admitted that an audit ordered by him into the matter following questions raised in both the Houses of the Parliament regarding irregularities in drug purchase under CGHS, had revealed that during 1996-97 drugs worth only Rs 26 crore were purchased through MSO while during the same period drugs worth Rs 60 crore were purchased from chemists.

Purchase from chemists kept increasing in subsequent years and in 1999-2000 it touched Rs.95 crore while those through MSO declined to Rs.6 crore, Thakur said. The CBI must go in deep into this aspect, he said adding that he welcomed the CBI probe.

Thakur claimed that he had tried to streamline the purchase of drugs by getting a formulary of medicine prepared by a committee headed by the head of medicine department of AIIMS, Delhi.

Thakur, who was appointed union health minister in May 2000 and remained on the post for about two years, said that he had received several anonymous letters and even legal notices opposing his move to get the formulary prepared which forced him to get the matter inquired by the crime branch of home ministry.

While stating that the formulary was finally notified in February 2002, Thakur said that the notification was yet to be enforced.

While admitting that his sons owned a pharmaceutical firm Chemonics at Ahmedabad, Thakur said that it had not supplied even a single tablet to the CGHS. Reacting strongly to Laloo''s allegation, Thakur said that true to his reputation the former was indulging in character assassination.

11,Gujarat govt to expand powers of finance commission,"GANDHINAGAR: The Gujarat government has decided to enhance the powers of the second state finance commission, constituted in November, to review the state of finances of local bodies -- panchayats, municipalities and municipal corporations.

The local bodies are known to be in dire financial health because of the poor devolution from the state exchequer, one reason why, say sources, the need arore to review the entire funds position of the state.

Issued by panchayats, rural housing and rural development department, an official note says the commission, chaired by former assembly speaker Dhirubhai Shah, ""shall review the state of finances of the state government"" and make recommendations regarding the state''s resource position ""on the basis of levels of taxation and non-tax revenues likely to be reached at the end of 2003-04."" This was not the case with the first finance commission.

Already, under chairman Shah, a senior IAS principal secretary-level official, J S Rana, has started collecting details based on the note. Yet another IAS official, an economist and a financial expert are likely to be appointed on the panel soon. The note says, ""The commission shall make its report available by October 15, 2005, covering a period of five years commending on April 1, 2005.""

The government notification (GR), referring to the enhancement of the powers of the finance commission, says, it would also look into ""the demands of the resources of the state government, in particular, on account of expenditure on civil administration, police and security, public works, general, social and economic services, debt servicing and other committed expenditures and liabilities.""

Significantly, the first finance commission, constituted in 1994, took four long years to submit a report on the devolution of funds to the local bodies. Says a state document, it made 63 recommendations for the rural bodies and 76 recommendations for the urban bodies.

Of these, the state accepted 42 recommendations fully and eight partially for the rural local bodies. As for the urban bodies, 46 recommendations were accepted fully, three partially, and 12 with some modifications.

The overall burden on the state exchequer by accepting the recommendations was Rs 79.52 crore per annum for the rural areas and Rs 166.14 crore for the urban areas. If all the recommendations had been accepted, the total burden on the exchequer would have been a stupendous Rs 1,350.38 crore, the document points out.

The aim of the second finance commission, said a top state government sources, would be to ""improve the financial position of the panchayats and the municipalities"" in order to make them more independent. The GR, too, stresses on ensuring the ""commercial viablity of the drinking water supply, drainage system, sanitation, street lights as well as other commercial operations like public transport through various means"".

The GR particularly wants the finance commission to make ""adjustment in user charges, reduce the cost of public services through privatisation and relinquish non-priority unviable areas."" At the same time, it wants the commission to provide ""adequate incentives"" to the local bodies for better resource mobilisation, financial discipline and cost effective provision of high quality public services.""

Sources said, the state has to shell out nearly 22 per cent of the exchequer''s income each year to run the local bodies. In 2001-02, the year for which latest figures were available, the state spent Rs 3,464 crore for that. Considering this as not enough to run the local bodies, the government recently asked a Centre-sponsored team to ""fully compensate"" to implement the recommendations made by the earlier finance commission.

The Central team was particularly asked to take care of the abolition of octroi in several municipalities and panchayats, compensate for the subsidy provided by the state government as electricity charges towards the drinking water schemes of the village panchayats, and provide ad-hoc grant for modernising the accounts of the village panchayats by using information technology tools.

13,Jail guards protest 'patronising of drug business',"Ferozepur: The jail guards posted at Ferozepur Central Jail staged a protest dharna on Saturday against the jail authorities for patronising drug business inside the jail.

They alleged that â€˜â€˜corruption was rampant in the jail and the criminals were using mobile phones freely in the jail.â€™â€™

However, jail superintendent GS Sidhu denied the allegations and termed their protest as an â€˜â€˜offshoot of the transfer of the president of the jail guards association.â€™â€™

The jail guards accused both the superintendent and deputy superintendent Sadhu Ram Jindal for the â€˜â€˜mismanagementâ€™â€™ of the jail.

They were, however, more critical of the deputy for â€˜â€˜hobnobbing with the criminals.â€™â€™

The guardsâ€™ body also alleged that the inmates were being supplied drugs and the facility of mobile phones by the deputy superintendent after charging a monthly fee from them. Four mobile phones were so far recovered from the inmates but the authorities took no action for obvious reasons, they alleged.

â€˜â€˜A hardcore criminal who was engaged in supari killing (contract killer) was shifted from the high security jail in Ferozepur to Fazilka, a sub jail recently,â€™â€™ they added.

The protesting guards also accused the authorities of many financial improprieties in the jail.

They blamed the deputy superintendent for embezzling funds collected from the inmates for managing the gurdwara and temple in the jail.

The guards charged that the deputy superintendent was already facing a criminal case of misappropriating government funds to the tune of Rs 65 lakh.

Rubbishing these allegations, Jindal said only a chip of a mobile phone was recovered from the jail and necessary action was taken in the case. The government provided no funds for gurdwara and temple and one inmate was shifted to the Fazilka jail after he was acquitted in one of the criminal cases by the court, Jindal clarified.

Hinting that it was a bargain game, the jail authorities revealed that the problem started when two inmates escaped from the jail in August last year. â€˜â€˜As many 24 junior officials and three senior officers were placed under suspension for the dereliction of duty for this incident. Jindal was one of the suspended officers and was reinstated only a few days back. But no jail guard has been reinstated yet,â€™â€™ said reliable sources, adding that the guards were annoyed with the authorities for this.

The transfer of Gurmej Singh, the president of the guardsâ€™ body from Ferozepur, upped the ante further. Jail superintendent said Gurmej was transferred four-five days back but the guards alleged that he was transferred on Saturday evening after a dharna by them.

The jail authorities are contemplating disciplinary action against the guards for organising the dharna.
