0,Johar using 'encroached' land for electioneering,"LUDHIANA: Punjab higher education minister Harnam Dass Johar has encroached a part of the busy public road near his residence on Dugri Road here.

Interestingly, the encroached part towards Model Town side has been covered with a 14-feet-high wall of tin sheets, mentioning an appeal to vote for the Congress candidate for Ludhiana LS seat.

In the absence of Johar, who is yet to return from Delhi after a foreign visit, his son Ajay Johar said that the wall was a temporary arrangement and would be demolished after the LS polls.

Incidentally, Ajay is the member of the district grievances committee. The encroachment, measuring about five feet is part of the election office of the Congress candidate set up on instruction of Johar in Ludhiana West Assembly constituency represented by him.

""Actually, this was erected to avoid exposing the rubble of our house under renovation,"" he said, when pointed out that it amounted to violation of poll code.

District returning officer and DC Anurag Verma said he would be in a position to comment only after ascertaining the facts from Ludhiana MC commissioner SK Sharma since the road was MC property.

Sharma could not be contacted since he was away on a holiday. ""Action will be initiated if it turned out that the appeal to vote was made on the encroached property,"" said Verma.

Mayor Nahar Singh Gill passed the buck on Sharma, while expressing ignorance about it. Senior advocate Pradeep Sharma said that the minister had set a wrong precedent, especially in a place like Ludhiana, where encroachments were galore.

Being a public representative, he should set an example by clearing the encroachment without any delay, he said.

1,Hoshiarpur drives over election code,"HOSHIARPUR: In what can be termed as a blatant violation of the model code of conduct, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) candidate Charanjit Channi, district Congress president Kuldip Nanda, BSP (Punjab) chief Avtar Singh Karmipuri and former Garhshankar MLA Shangara Ram Sahungra are using red lights atop their vehicles during electioneering.

The DCC president''s Bolero jeep (PB-07-M-4700) was seen parked outside the DCC office with a red light atop on Thursday evening while he was addressing a party workers'' meeting.

Karimpuri''s Toyota Qualis (PB-01-L-8515) was spotted at a public rally at Maharaja Palace on Friday.

Channi''s (PB-08AL (Temp)-0565)) and MLA Sahungra''s (PB-12-E-9759) jeeps were spotted with red lights atop during the opening of the BSP''s election office near the new Co-operative Bank on Railway Road on Friday.

Nanda, however, told TNN that he had removed the red light. Karimpuri said that the anomaly would be rectified and he would ensure that the BSP does not flout the code of conduct.

Hoshiarpur deputy commissioner-cum-district election officer, when contacted, told TNN that the violation would be checked immediately.

He said that since it was brought to his notice, nobody would be allowed to break the model code of conduct.

The police claimed that instructions would be passed to the traffic police to enforce law and no slackness will be tolerated.

2,'SP manifesto exposes party's evil designs',"LUCKNOW: The BJP has described the Samajwadi Party manifesto as a ''chargesheet'' against the party and one that brings out the misdeeds of the SP government, headed by Mulayam Singh Yadav.

BJP vice-president and spokesperson HN Dixit alleged that instead of announcing the party''s policies and programmes for development of Uttar Pradesh, the Samajwadi Party manifesto appeared more of a ''chargesheet'' against the BJP and SP''s own coalition government in the state.

""SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav not only made a mockery of constitutional provisions in the manifesto but also tried to divide society on communal lines by advocating quota for Muslims and offering sops to a particular section,"" he alleged.

Accusing Mulayam of being anti-upper caste, Dixit said that Mulayam wants to usher in social changes by denying rights to the backwards among forwards.

""His manifesto speaks volumes of Samajwadi Party''s casteist policies and his anti-upper caste mentality,"" he said.

Even though policymakers and constitutional experts had rejected quota on communal lines, the SP manifesto advocates quota for Muslims in government jobs.

""It''s nothing but a sop for Muslims who are disenchanted with the Samajwadi Party and are drifting away from Mulayam Singh Yadavji,"" he said.

The SP manifesto also talks of changing history text books. ""Will Mulayam change historical facts that Babar and Ghazni were Muslim invaders who destroyed temples and looted the country''s wealth?"" the BJP leader sought to know.

""Samajwadi Party has promised to check misuse of the SC/ST Act and proposed amendments to the Jail Manual. While cases of its abuse are on the rise what steps did the SP-led coalition take in its seven-month rule? Changes in the Jail Manual are being sought to extend facilities to its own partymen who often cool their heels in jails,"" quipped the BJP vice-president.

The SP manifesto talks of checking human rights violation, pointed out Dixit, demanding a quick survey to dig out cases of human rights violation ever since its government came to power in the state.

""Uttar Pradesh has recorded maximum number of human rights violation cases in the last seven months, but no action was initiated against trigger-happy cops,"" he charged, citing cases of police firing in Kushinagar and other districts.

3,Development is SP's only concern,"LUCKNOW: Samajwadi Party president Mulayam Singh Yadav on Friday prevaricated a direct reply to his party''s stand on the Bofors controversy being raked up again and said that currently, the only objective before the SP was development of the country.

He said a lot of discussion on the issue had been held for the past 16 years and wondered how long it would continue when there were other pressing problems facing the nation.

Speaking at a press conference shortly after releasing the party''s manifesto, Mulayam decried the BJP''s silence on the foreign origin issue of Congress when the SP had raised it first and added that the BJP could do anything to stay in power.

The reference was to the BJP''s move of bringing a law to debar people of foreign origin from holding constitutional posts.

He added foreign origin was currently not an issue with the SP which was involved in other matters relating to the country.

Maintaining that the party''s stand all through on the Ayodhya issue had been adherence to the decision of the court, the SP president said even the minorities favoured the same, but the BJP insisted on singing a different tune.

He said it was disgraceful that Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee and Deputy Prime Minister LK Advani had to tell people to vote for the BJP so that the Mandir could be built.

Mulayam wondered what kind of message the duo was sending to the whole world. He said it was shameful that instead of raising issues which directly concerned the people they were asking for votes in the name of the temple.

""Desh ka samman giraya hai,"" (they have lowered the prestige of the nation) was how he put it. He stressed that during every election the saffron party specialised in raising issues directly related to ''janam ''(birth) like dharam and religion.

Queried on reservation of jobs in private companies, the SP president said it was started by the Congress and speeded up by the BJP and said while it was easy to ensure reservation in private companies of the country the same would be opposed by MNCs.

Speaking about the confederation of India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, Mulayam said it would go a long way in easing tensions between neighbouring countries and said a beginning could be made by having a cricket team with players from India and Pakistan.

He, however, could not stop from expressing his dislike for the game.

4,Basement laws flouted: residents,"BANGALORE: Building bylaws have been thrown to winds. High Court directives are being ignored and rules have taken a back seat. This is how the BCC functions, maintain residents of CMH Double Road in Indiranagar.

Adding to the already existing list of illegal shops in the basements and in violation of Karnataka Municipal Corporation (KMC) Act, the BCC recently gave permission to start a beauty parlour at the basement of a multi-storeyed building on CMH Double Road, the residents said.

They are up in arms against this move and their plea has fallen on deaf ears.

â€œWe have approached the health department. But they seem to be hand-in-glove with the beauty parlour owner. How can the health department sanction licence to run a beauty parlour in the basement?â€™â€™ the residents questioned.

Though there are strict directions to the BCC from the High Court to clear the basements of illegal establishments, the Corporation is yet to wake up and act.

5,96 with criminal cases in fray for Phase I polls,"BANGALORE: Believe it or not! As many as 96 candidates with at least one criminal case, which attracts two years or more imprisonment, are in the fray for the first phase of the Assembly polls.

According to a report prepared by the Karnataka Election Watch (KEW), the findings reveal that all three major parties â€” Congress, BJP and JD(S) â€” have fielded candidates facing serious charges including IPC Sections 307 (attempt to murder) and Section 506 (criminal intimidation and death threats).

â€œCompilation of data from 100 out of 120 Assembly constituencies that go to polls on April 20 has been completed. Interestingly, the number of candidates facing charges is more than some north Indian states like Delhi, Gujarat and Rajasthan,â€™â€™ KEW convener Trilochan Sastry said in the report.

â€œThe data also show that voters have little to choose between as parties cynically continue to compete on the basis of money and muscle power,â€™â€™ he pointed out. Though parties try to cover up the issue claiming that the cases were filed for holding political rallies and agitations, the data show that it is untenable.

â€œAs many as 46 candidates representing Congress, BJP and JD(S) are facing charges for violent crimes, including death threats. The remaining 50 candidates belong to other parties or are independents,â€™â€™ Sastry observed.

Financial status: Sastry noted that candidates are not revealing their financial status properly. â€œIt is in gross violation of Supreme Court judgements. Out of 652 affidavits, 324 candidates have not disclosed their income tax PAN numbers,â€™â€™ he said.

Besides, government dues are also a problem. â€œFrom the three major parties, there are 23 candidates, who owe money to government in taxes, rent, electricity, water and telephone bills. One candidate owes Rs 62 lakhs,â€™â€™ he stated.

6,CBI notice to UP minister,"LUCKNOW: Following directives from the High Court to continue with further investigations into Madhumita murder case, the Central Bureau of Investigations (CBI) on Friday served notices on a minister of state in UP government and five others.

As none of them accepted the notices, the CBI messenger had to return with them.

Sources said that the CBI served a notice on Shyam Narain Tewari, a minister of state and uncle of Amarmani Tripathi, an accused in the case.

Others include the domestic helps of Amarmani identified as Pappu Chowdhary, Gyanu Pansi, Vibhor, Maya Singh and Dinesh Yadav.

The notices were served at the Lawrence Terrace residence of Tripathi, but the CBI messengers were forced to return without handing over the notices as the occupants of the house did not accept the documents.

They also ensured that notices were not pasted outside the house either, CBI sources alleged.

7,Midnapore keen to keep peace during polls,"MIDNAPORE: The Midnapore West district administration has embarked upon a poster campaign, appealing to political parties to stay away from violence.

At another level, it has started making preventive arrests to prevent known criminals from disturbing the May 10 polls. Midnapore West DM Chandan Sinha and police superintendent Praveen Kumar in a joint Press conference said that already 2,500 people had been arrested in different parts of the district, in which 1,000 were preventive arrests.

The rest of the arrests were in specific cases, in non-bailable sections. The Eastern Frontier Rifles has started a route march in Keshpur Pingla and Sabang and Section 144 has been promulgated throughout the district.

This would mean restrictions on movement even with licensed arms, Kumar said. Midnapore West Trinamul Congress district secretary Ajit Bhuiyan said that this had been done after Trinamul chief Mamata Banerjee informed the Election Commission about the situation in the district.

Trinamul candidate from Jhargram Nityananda Hembram alleged that the CPM has threatened voters with dire consequences in Salboni, Chandrakona Road and Goaltore if they exercised their franchise.

8,"Fake document racket busted, two arrested","HYDERABAD: Two persons involved in making and circulating fake documents essential to obtain a non-immigration visa to foreign countries were arrested by the Tappachabutra police on Friday morning at the Karwan Darbar Maisamma Temple.

The two men, Asiam Hasan Ali Gowani, 27, and K Umapathy, 50, residents of Upperpally and Uppuguda respectively, were found in possession of forged documents and about 700 counterfeit rubber stamps of different departments.

Gowani, a commerce graduate, forged documents using fake rubber stamps made by Umapathi and circulated the same among people interested in going to UK, US, Australia and other countries.

All the documents required by a candidate going to a foreign country on a non-immigration visa were supplied by Gowani. These included income tax returns, bank statements, letter pads from different companies, property documents, MCH licence, labour licence, sales tax license, PAN card and bonafide certificates from school and college. Umapathi made fake rubber stamps on Gowaniâ€™s instructions. Some of the stamps found in his possession include those of the income tax department, MCH, Banks, Commercial Tax Office, labour department, registration department of AP, Bangalore, Chennai, Mumbai and Ahmedabad. Stamps of New York, New Jersey, California and Chicago notary were also found.

9,Rival parties clash over poll graffiti,"BURDWAN: Poll graffiti is fast turning into a tinderbox in Bengalâ€™s electoral politics. Trinamul Congress workers have objected to a CPM graffiti at Khondoghosh in Burdwan which depicted scenes of Gujarat violence.

The controversial graffiti urges voters to take revenge for the Gujarat mass killings after the Godhra incident. (Gujarat gonohottar protisodh nin) and also draws attention to demolition of mosques, rape of pregnant women and destruction of property.

Criticising the posters, Trinamul Congress organisational secretary of Burdwan, Chandranath Mukherjee, threatened to send a formal complaint to chief electoral officer of West Bengal. â€œThe CPM is trying to woo the minority vote bank unethically,â€� he said.

Subrata Gupta, district magistrate of Burdwan said that steps would be taken to stop such writings. CPM district secretary Amal Halder denied involvement of his partymen in these writings. â€œThe opposition parties are trying to malign our image by writing such rubbish in our name,â€� he said.

With Mamata Banerjee scheduled to start campaigning in Burdwan on Sunday further tension cannot be ruled out. Earlier, district magistrate of Bankura had to erase the wall graffiti depicting Dhantola rape incident.

The area comes under Khondoghosh Assembly constituency, which has been lying vacant after CPM legislator Jyotsna Singha resigned.

10,Panel to redefine govt 'aid',"PUNE: Are unaided medical and dental colleges in the state truly unaided? While a sizeable number of private medical institutions in the state have increased their fees substantially after a supreme court order - on the plea that they don''t take favours from the government - the state government has constituted a high-level committee to determine their status and classify them as aided, partially aided or unaided.

The committee, under the chairmanship of W.B. Tayade, joint director of medical education and research, has been asked to submit its report by April 15.

Other members on the committee are cost accountant D.V. Patwardhan, deputy secretary A.N. Naiknavare, additional secretary (law) Dattatray Parkhe, and additional secretary (medical education and drugs department) B.R. Gavit.

Official sources said the committee was formed after a court ruling in 2003 to find out how many private medical and dental colleges were availing concessions from the government.

The state''s ministers for health and technical education had earlier said private colleges have at some point of time taken favours from the government, either in the form of land or other aid.

While the committee will scrutinise documents already submitted by the private colleges before making a final judgement and classification, the officials pointed out that the relevance of determining the aid provided by the government, as it has a substantial bearing on the fee structure of medical education.

The committee members will hear from all the managements of institutions that have filed the information as directed by the Bombay high court, besides examining the legal provisions of individual cases.

The Students'' Federation of India (SFI) had earlier suggested that the state government exercise total control over all private engineering and medical colleges.

Disclaiming the rationale given by private educational institutions that they could fix their own fee structures in the wake of the supreme court order, SFI secretary Maharudra Dake had said that private colleges have taken some favour or the other from the government, and hence cannot be termed as unaided colleges.

11,Centre rebuffs EC on exit polls,"NEW DELHI: The Centre on Friday rebuffed the Election Commission''s suggestion to bring an ordinance banning opinion and exit polls, saying this would go against constitutionally guaranteed freedom of expression.

The government''s ''no'' was conveyed to the Commission following an opinion by the AttorneyGeneral, Soli J Sorabjee, that the ordinance would infringe Article 19(1A) of the Constitution guaranteeing freedom of expression.

In a communication to the Commission, which has lately been anxious to expand its jurisdiction, the government lobbed the ball into the court of the poll commissioners, saying in case they wanted to introduce certain regulations for opinion or exit polls, they could do so under Article 324, which gives them the mandate to superintend elections.

In a four-page opinion, Sorabjee said the proposed ordinance would strike at freedom of information. The EC had sought the ban on the basis of the ""unanimous"" view of the political class.

However, the attorney-general pointed out that while ""regard must be paid to the unanimous view of political parties, their view is not decisive on the constitutionality of a statute.""

This was the second setback to the EC''s effort to ban opinion and exit polls on the ground that they could prejudice voters.

Earlier, it had issued guidelines in 1998, but had to back off after the Supreme Court reminded it that it lacked the statutory sanction to do so.

Significantly, in reviving the ban bid, the Commission ignored the Supreme Court''s designation of the right to information as a fundamental right.

12,Arms smugglers had political support?,"NEW DELHI: The LTTE has emerged as a suspect in the huge arms haul seizure in Bangladesh last week because of its formidable shipping capabilities.

However, officials are skeptical because so far there has been no firm link between the Tamil Tigers and insurgent groups in the north-east.

The fact that half the AK-47s seized have folding stocks suggests they were intended for concealed use, possibly as far afield as Kashmir.

Indian officials also say the arms consignment included an indeterminate number of night-vision goggles which would be a first for insurgent groups here though the Bangladeshi authorities have been silent on this aspect so far.

Indian officials are also convinced the smugglers had some administrative and political backing in Chittagong. ""You won''t risk a consignment of this size without connections.""

On their part, Bangladeshi officials don''t rule out corruption at the local level but insist Dhaka is doing everything to probe the matter.

""We have appointed a very high-level inquiry headed by the home secretary. More than anyone, we want to get to the bottom of this,"" a senior Bangladeshi source said.

Since the arms were recovered from two trawlers which had earlier received the same from a larger vessel mid-sea, Indian officials are looking at the Chittagong port manifest with great interest.

Among the ships there at the time were MV Orient Freedom and MV QC Honour, both owned by QC Shipping of Salahuddin Qader Chowdhury, said an intelligence source.

This should be looked into, as well as the movements of another of his ships, MV QC Til, to see if any of these offloaded the cargo at anchorage to the two trawlers.

13,Mandir issue solution after polls: Dy PM,"HAZARIBAG: A day after the release of NDA manifesto, which proposed an early solution to the Ram Mandir issue through talks, deputy prime minister L K Advani expressed confidence that the imbroglio would be solved soon after the Lok Sabha elections.

Advani whose Bharat Uday Rath entered Jharkhand on Thursday was speaking to media persons at Hazaribag on Friday morning. After short meetings at Ramgarh, Ranchi and Gumla, Advani left for Chhattisgarh.

In the last six months, ice seems to have broken between the parties concerned with the Babri Masjid and Ram temple issue as a result of relentless and quiet efforts initiated by Kanchi Shankaracharya and the Dalai Lama, said Advani.

Advani, however, dismissed allegations of any pressure being exerted by the BJP on its coalition partners stating that there was neither any proposal from the party nor did it ever nurture hope of its partners favouring the Ram Mandir issue.

The only issue in the last elections was developing a nuclear deterrent in the country, he said adding that the issue was included in the 1999 poll manifesto after all partners agreed to it.

As far as Ayodhya was concerned, he said all the coalition parties agreed that it was either the decision of the court or a consensus among all parties concerned which could bring about a tangible solution to the problem.

Reacting to the latest twist in the Bofors controversy, Advani justified law minister Arun Jaitley''s demand of an explanation from AICC president Sonia Gandhi whether she was willing to tell the nation all she knew about the case if she was aspiring to hold the highest office in the country.

The Congress, he said, instead of looking for motives behind the revelations should answer Jaitley''s questions.

After all, the Bofors case is a public issue which had played a crucial role in the 1989 elections and such startling revelations by an investigating officer cannot be disregarded, Advani said.

14,"Mitrasen dodges EC, fights polls","LUCKNOW: With 34 criminal cases on his head, how is BSP candidate from Faizabad, Mitrasen Yadav, contesting elections? Simple: he used an earlier EC order issued in his favour to get his nomination cleared by the returning officer (RO).

During scrutiny of papers on Thursday, RO Deepak Kumar held his nomination papers valid when an independent candidate, Hubraj, withdrew a complaint against him at the last minute.

A fresh complaint by SP candidate Ashok Singh, was not entertained as RO declared it ""time-barred"".

EC''s stringent new guidelines failed to deter Mitrasen from contesting again from Faizabad. Still to remain on a safe side, the two-time MP and five-time MLA had played safe by asking son Anandsen to file his nomination as a dummy candidate.

In the affidavit, Mitrasen had listed 34 criminal cases including three murders and seven attempt to murder charges. In 13 of the 34 cases, the affidavit said, he was either acquitted or final reports were filed. In 18 others charges could not be proved.

The affidavit also said that Mitrasen was sentenced to life imprisonment in December 1966 by a Faizabad judge for the murder of a Jan Sangh leader Mathura Prasad Tiwari. The high court had confirmed the sentence rejecting his appeal.

However, Yadav sought and was given remission in sentence by the governor in 1967.

Subsequently, EC in its order of October 9, 1972 had initiated disqualification proceedings against him under Section 8 (2) of the Representation of People Act (RPA) barring him to contest any poll for a period of five years up to October 8, 1977.

Although the high court ruling was against Mitrasen and he was disallowed by it in January 2004 to contest polls of a school management committee because of his conviction, the 1977 order of the EC helped Mitrasen remain in fray for LS polls.

15,The unbearable lightness of incumbency,"AHMEDABAD: Awidely accepted maxim of electoral politics is that a party in power has to face the burden of ""anti incumbency"" factor at the hustings, and it helps the Opposition party.

Usually the challenging party goes to polls complaining of lack of development, while the ruling party is nearly always hard pressed to answer these charges.

But in election 2004, the reverse seems to be happening. It is the ruling BJP which is talking of development issues confidently while the opposition Congress'' reaction is muted.

How has this happened? Simply by changing the reference period of the discourse, the strategists of the ruling party have skillfully thrown the ""anti incumbency"" ball into the Congress'' court.

The attempt is to make the Congress face the anti-incumbency disadvantage, even though the party is out of power.

Usually during elections, the reference period for talking about issues is the last five years, during which the ruling power has been in power.

But the BJP with its ''5 versus 50'' slogan has widened the reference period from 1951, when the first elections were held, to the present time.

BJP''s main campaigners are now screaming from the rooftops about how inadequate development in the last 50 years has left the country starved for essential infrastructure.

Campaign speeches end with a request and a promise: vote for us and by 2020 India will be a fully developed nation.

That the BJP leaders deliver the message in a simplified fashion (albeit using half information) makes it very effective.

This writer is witness to the following two instances:

Central minister, Kashiram Rana is introduced to a corporate executive on a train. The executive is a fence-sitter and can''t decide whom to vote for. Rana does not know this, but says ""see in five years we made so many highways and in 50 years the Congress did nothing pleading lack of funds. We just put a one rupee levy on sale of petrol and no one even realised they had been taxed. With the money we built highways."" The executive has converted to the BJP cause.

L K Advani says at a public meeting that 20 years ago an acquaintance of his stood for elections though he didn''t have a ghost of a chance. Asked why he was contesting, the man said that for 10 years he had been trying to get a telephone connection.

Since a contestant gets a temporary phone connection, he became a candidate. An official who was empowered to convert temporary connections to permanent would help later.

Advani ends by saying: ""See this was the state of affairs in the Congress regime, but now it takes a minute to get a phone connection."" The crowd claps.

""The last fifty years has seen a lot of development in the country, but obviously with the exploding population there are unfulfilled aspirations everywhere. It is this sentiment that the BJP is exploiting by acting in the manner of an opposition party,"" points out an analyst.

The bountiful monsoons last year (leading to higher farm incomes) and the falling dollar (leading to a stronger rupee and forex inflows into the market) has revved up the economy and meant a temporary fulfillment of aspirations.

This stands in sharp contrast to the unfulfilled aspirations of the last 50 years and gives an advantge to the BJP vis-a-vis the Congress in the matter of the anti-incumbency effect.

16,Article 356 if Bihar govt stopped Advani,"NEW DELHI: The BJP was working on a gameplan that envisoned imposition of Article 356 on Bihar if RJD chief Laloo Yadav sprung a surprise by getting the government to arrest Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani when the Bharat Uday Yatra entered the state.

The RJD boss had not threatened to arrest Advani, but given his track record for brinksmanship, the BJP managers thought it wise to consider their options.

In 1990, when Laloo Yadav had arrested Advani at Samastipur, even his closest aides had not got a hint.

The BJP assessment was that given the bitterly contested nature of elections in Bihar, Laloo Yadav could be tempted to consolidate the anti-saffron vote.

It was in this context that the BJP felt it could also seek to polarise its vote by putting RJD out of office.

17,EC has authority to ban exit polls: CPM,"NEW DELHI: The CPM on Friday said the Election Commission, under Article 324 of the Constitution, had all the power to issue orders against opinion polls. It should not wait for an ordinance from the government, it added.

CPM politburo member Prakash Karat said: ""The government should not promulgate an ordinance, particularly since Parliament is dissolved. The EC has broad powers under Article 324 in the superintendence of elections. It does not need an ordinance.""

Karat also asked the TDP and Trinamul Congress whether they agreed with the NDA manifesto that included BJP''s demands like the Ram temple in Ayodhya and cow protection.

""Why is George Fernandes silent on Article 370? There is no word on this in the manifesto,"" he said.

The party also asked the Centre not to consider the US'' renewed request for Indian troops to Iraq.

""We support the popular uprising against the US occupation in Iraq. The UN left Iraq sometime ago and it is not going back. The US request is just a pretext to get our troops in when NATO allies are pulling out,"" he said.

18,Thakur denies hand in Patna incident,"PATNA: BJP nominee from Patna and union minister Dr C P Thakur, while admitting that tension prevailed in major parts of Patna central assembly, said that neither he nor his party had anything to do with the incident.

He said this in the wake of the Gandhinagar incident in which unidentified criminals shot dead one RJD worker Raju and injured three others on Saturday morning.

Reacting sharply to the statement of RJD nominee from Patna, Ram Kripal Yadav holding Thakur and BJP responsible for the incident, the latter said that the incident was part of a well planned consipracy hatched by RJD to create caste tension in the city to disturb PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee''s public meeting in Patna scheduled for Saturday evening.

Thakur claimed that Raju was a BJP sympathiser hence the question of BJP workers attacking him did not arise. Patna parliamentary constituency will go to polls on April 20.

Thakur and state BJP vice-president Arun Kumar Sinha instead held the RJD candidate Ram Kripal Yadav and his supporters responsible for the incident. They said that the incident was the result of RJD effort to generate people''s support for its nominee by creating caste tension in the constituency.

Thakur attributed the incident to a dispute over collection of Rangdari (extortion) tax from a local sweetmeat shop between two groups.

Thakur and BJP spokesperson Kiran Ghai severely condemned the incident and requested the Election Commission (EC) to take serious note of such incidents and direct the state and district administration to initiate steps to prevent such incidents.

The party will also submit a memorandum to EC and prime minister in this regard. The BJP will request EC to deploy para-military forces at every booth of Patna parliamentary constituency.

Thakur said that he would meet the kin of slain Raju. He added that no one should be killed in poll violence anywhere in the state. Ghai said that in the 1999 LS polls 74 persons were killed in poll related violence.

Sinha said that BJP had stopped its party workers from campaigning in Patna central segment of the constituency following an attack on one of its publicity vehicle carrying party workers at Saidpur area allegedly by RJD workers soon after Gandhinagar incident in which three BJP workers received injuries while windscreen of the vehicle was smashed.

The BJP would lodge an FIR with the police in connection with Saidpur incident, Sinha added.

Thakur said that the incident took place at around 9.00 a.m and he was campaigning in Mithapur and Jakkanpur areas of the constituency after 8.30 a.m after meeting Patna SP. Thakur said that he met Patna district magistrate at 8.00 a.m.

19,Ex-teachers make the political arena their classroom,"AHMEDABAD: If history sheeters rule politics in Bihar, it is the â€˜gurusâ€™, who are out to capture politics in Gujarat. â€œShikshak kabhi sadharan nahin hota, pralay aur kranti inki gode me palte hainâ€� reads the pamphlet quoting master strategist Chanakya circulated by Vitthal Pandya, father of slain BJP leader Haren Pandya.

Pandya, a retired school teacher contesting against LK Advani as an Independent, is one more addition to the big number of teachers who have moved out of their classrooms to create a political revolution of sorts. Interestingly, Pandya has chosen a book as his symbol.

Ratilal Verma, Harin Pathak, Shankersinh Vaghela, Ramila Bara, Ramsinh Rathwa, Madhusudan Mistry, are some of the other â€˜gurusâ€™ in fray for Lok Sabha elections 2004. Not to forget education minister Anandiben Patel and senior Congress leader Urmilaben Patel, who are leading the way, campaigning hard for the candidates.

Though their earlier jobs and the prospective one may have little in common, they could encash on their skills to compel a crowd to listen to them, be it is the classroom, the Parliament or a public meeting. While Verma is presently working as a principal in Pandit Nehru Vidya Vihar Secondary School in Behrampura, Harin Pathak took voluntary retirement from Nalanda High School in Saraspur, where he taught.

If Shankersinh Vaghela worked as an NCC instructor in a college in Unjha, Ramsinh Rathwa, BJPâ€™s candidate from Chotta Udepur, was an art teacher in Jiwan Sadhna School in Vadodara. And, while Ramila Bara, BJPâ€™s candidate from Sabarkantha worked as an assistant teacher in Maharaja High School in Vijaynagar in Sabarkantha earlier, her rival Madhusudhan Mistry delivers lectures in many institutes.

â€œI believe teachers can become better politicians. Teachers can stop criminalisation of politics,â€� says Pandya. He believes that teachers are scared of entering politics for a variety of reasons. â€œPerhaps, the ugliness of politics is scaring them. But the scene will certainly improve if more such people come out,â€� he adds.

Harin Pathak believes that his teaching career has helped him immensely in politics. â€œIn the course of 1969 to 1992 (the year when he took voluntary retirement), I must have come in contact with at least 60,000 families. Some of my old students have grandchildren who are eligible to vote,â€� he says.

However, isnâ€™t the two professions poles apart â€” one a pious profession and the other a corrupt occupation. â€œPolitics is a science. And no science can be bad. Itâ€™s the people in it who are bad,â€� he says. According to him, there are bad people in all professions, so why blame only politicsâ€�, argues Shankersinh Vaghela. Anandiben Patel, who used to teach science and maths in Mohiniba Kanya Vidyalaya in Ahmedabad and later went to become the principal of the same school before she took voluntary retirement to pursue full-time politics, confesses tenure as a teacher has helped her as a becoming a good politician. â€œIf you have been a teacher, you bring discipline to politicsâ€�, says Patel.

Not only this, teachers also get an ready-made team of followers. â€œWherever I campaign, I invariable meet one of my old student who come up to pay his respect. Once the link is established, many take up the responsibility to campaign for me in that village,â€� says Patel.

â€œIn my 30 years at the SV College, I have taught over 50,000 students. In fact, many of my students are active in rival parties too but do not fail to touch my feet whenever they see me,â€� says Urmilaben Patel.
