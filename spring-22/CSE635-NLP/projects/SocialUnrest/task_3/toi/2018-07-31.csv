0,Another Bengal minister involved in controversy,"kolkata: after transport minister subhas chakrabarty's name was dragged into the salt lake stadium controversy, the last thing the cpm wanted was the involvement of another senior party functionary in the murky abduction drama. hence, cpm mla from ballygunj rabin deb was quick to come out with a statement, both in the house and outside, that though he knew md taslim alias chunua miyan, arrested in connection with the abduction of shoe magnate partha roy burman, he had nothing to do with the accused. in fact, deb went a step further and said that chunua was in fact the secretary of the local rajiv gandhi memorial committee, which was presided over by a trinamul leader and a cmc member mayor-in-council who was elected from the area. ""i knew chunua as he lives in my constituency. as an mla i have to meet all kinds of people. but this person is in no way a member of my party,"" deb said, talking to newsmen in kolkata on monday. deb said that he was not responsible for what chunua or any other person did. ""i heard that he owned a small business, and that's about all. i am not giving certificate to anyone,"" deb said. deb clarified that chunua never came to him for help. ""i had been to functions organised by local clubs and other organisations. many people had come there,"" he pointed out. citing an incident of shooting that took place at the topsia football ground last year, deb said there was no question of defending chunua for the shooting incident as he was one of the targets of the attack. ""yes, i rushed to see what happened as i am expected to do so being a public representativc,"" deb said. he went on to say that bringing back partha roy burman was the primary task and that he was assisting the police and the investigative agencies in his capacity as a public representative from the area. chunua's arrest rocked the assembly proceedings as well, as treasury and opposition benches locked horns over his reported links with cpm mla rabin deb. bringing up the issue during the mention session, leader of the opposition pankaj banerjee condemned the link. ""it has been reported that chunua is the right hand man of rabin deb. if such people are right hand men of mlas, it is a shame for all of us. the chief minister must look into this,"" he said. he was joined by trinamul congress mlas saugata roy, tapas roy and sobhandeb chattopadhyay. ""this linkage clearly shows that the oasis which the chief minister talks of exists only for the anti-socials and not for the common people,"" tapas roy said.

2,Irrigation dept warning has political overtones,"pune: the state irrigation department's warning that it would stop the supply of raw water from the khadakwasla dam to the city if the pune municipal corporation (pmc) failed to pay its dues amounting to rs 10.16 crore has raised more than one question. the warning has established that the long-drawn dispute between the irrigation department and the pmc over the finalisation of the raw water charges and the meter readings has not ended. this, despite the pmc spending over rs 60 crore on the khadakwasla-parvati water line and installing a giant, modern meter to measure the quantum of water drawn from the khadakwasla dam. interestingly, the ultimatum to the pmc also indicates that the state rulers have adopted an offensive stand against a senior congress leader who controls the functioning of the ruling congress in the pmc. according to political observers, the step-by-step release of the chargesheets against senior civic officers, the refusal by the state leaders to assist the partymen in burying the hedgewar portrait issue, the delay in sanctioning several policy proposals pertaining to pune city and now the warning to cut the water supply to pune city are all aimed at harassing the pune-based leader. when contacted, the officers from the state irrigation department, however, refuted to attach any political motive to the notice issued by them. ""we need the money money to pay the bills of the contractors,"" a maharashtra krishna valley development corporation (mkvdc) officer said, pointing out that the mkvdc has raised funds for building the dams by floating bonds. however, the mkvdc officials know perfectly well that the ultimatum would only remain on paper as the elected members and political workers would take to the streets if the water supply to the city is suspended even for one day. ""but our motive behind issuing the ultimatum is to make the elected members aware that the pmc administration is still disputing the rates and the meter readings,"" an mkvdc official said. it may be noted here that while seeking the civic general body's approval to the rs 60-crore closed water pipeline project, the pmc officers had argued that the commissioning of the line would prove economical in the long run. the civic officers had pointed out that the irrigation department charges rs 3.65 per ten thousand litres of water if it is drawn from the mutha right bank canal and just rs 1.70 if it is drawn directly from the khadakwasla dam using the pipeline. but it was after the commissioning of the rs 60-crore water line that the irrigation department clarified that no formal decision has yet been taken to grant concession to the pmc in the raw water charges. though the pmc had installed a giant water meter at its water pipeline inside the campus of the khadakwasala dam, the problem with meter readings still persists. in addition, the pmc still continues to draw around 55 cusecs of water from the main canal leading to further differences in calculating the bill amount. these disputes about the rates and meter readings have led to the present problem, a civic officer said, adding that the pmc has paid only the bill amount which it feels is correct. he said that the municipal commissioner will soon hold talks with the higher officials in the state to sort out the dispute over the ""excess"" bill amount of rs 10.16 crore. pmc yet to recover dues from govt offices. while the state irrigation department has issued an ultimatum to the pmc asking it to pay the raw water dues forthwith, the pmc administration is still to initiate a similar action against various state and central government organisations which have not paid the municipal water dues for last several years. according to the civic officials' own admission on the floor of the house in october last, the total outstanding water tax and property tax dues are over rs 78 crore! thus, if the pmc recovers dues from these organisations, it will be able to pay the irrigation department dues in a jiffy. there are 214 organisations, including some important government offices, which have not paid tax dues of over rs 5 lakh each. the list of 81 defaulters includes the office of pune divisional commissioner, pune police commissioner, pimpri-chinchwad municipal corporation, mseb, yerwada prison press and several defence establishments. not just the government offices, the pmc has not been able to recover the property-tax dues from individuals and builders as well. the civic administration, which cuts the water supply if a common citizen fails to pay the water tax, is still to recover tax dues of rs 90 lakh from a city-based builder.

11,PSU policy comes in for flak,"kolkata: the west bengal assembly, on the final day of its budget session, unanimously adopted a motion criticising the centre for its policy of closing public sector units and urged the centre to desist from this policy and plan revival packages for the sick units. there is no difference between the economic policies of the bjp and the congress, state labour minister mohammed amin said during the debate. he commended the workers for the successful strike by government employees throughout the country. if such a strike occurred in europe, the government would have resigned the next day, he said. it was encouraging that rival trade unions like the indian national trade union congress and the bharatiya mazdoor sangh have also supported the move, he added. trinamul congress mlas supported the motion, of course with reservations. even when we were in the government, our mps have always protested against this policy in parliament, party mla sobhandeb chattopadhyay said. he alleged that the closures were due to the adventurism of the left parties. due to the adventurist policies of the left parties, flight of capital took place from the state, he remarked. while it was not possible to tackle privatisation per se as it was a global phenomenon, the trinamul was ready to be part of an all-party delegation of the assembly to delhi to put pressure on the centre. motion to curb arsenic contamination: the west bengal assembly, in a motion adopted unanimously on tuesday, condemned the centre's attempts to saffronise education and culture and called on all state governments to organise a nation-wide movement against the right-wing campaign. moving the motion, cpm mla padmanidhi dhar said that the bjp-led nda government was trying to take the country back to the middle ages. they are trying to introduce subjects like astrology and vaastu shastra in the curriculum. they never bothered to discuss the matter with the state governments, he said. trinamul mlas supported the motion, but simultaneously protested the left front's policy of painting the education system red. the gita and the upanishads are the best examples of philosophy. jyotish (astrology) has been an essential part of the study of the vedic texts, and there is nothing wrong in that, trinamul congress mla jyotirmoy kar said. trinamul mla sobhandeb chattopadhyay protested against the use of the word saffronisation in the motion. saffron is a colour which marks spiritualism of india. it is not the bjp's property, he said.

15,Officials up in arms over downsizing of govt depts,"kolkata: officials of city-based joint plant committee (jpc) has launched a major offensive against the geethakrishnan committee recommendation to downsize different government departments, including steel. reacting sharply to the former finance secretary's suggestion that the office be shut down, jpc officials state that the organisation should not have featured in the recommendation list in the first place as various documents indicate that it is not a part of the union steel ministry. ""various documents, including the annual report submitted to parliament every year by the steel ministry, makes no mention of the organisation. furthermore, the indian government, while responding to allegations leveled by the us commerce department, has admitted that jpc is an independent authority controlling the steel development fund (sdf). the organisation has never received any budgetary support from the consolidated fund of india,"" sources in jpc said. various expenditures, including salary to 205 member staff, are paid through the returns that accrue from various investments made with different funds under its care, including sdf. the geethakrishnan committee has recommended that these funds, adding up to rs 230 crore, be transferred to the public accounts committee of india and into a new separate sdf. jpc was constituted in 1964 as an autonomous committee drawing powers from clause 17b of the iron & steel control order, 1956. the organisation was created to formulate policy guidelines regarding distribution of steel, pricing and availability of iron and steel to the end users from the main producers. after the economy opened up, the organisation has acted as a buffer between the integrated steel plants and the secondary producers. while jpc officials allege that their activities, that included marketing initiatives to help the industry tide over the recession, they are furious at the lack of proper representation by the steel ministry when geethakrishnan was running a toothcomb through various departments. ""the section of the report dealing with steel has been prepared after feedback from the additional secretary (finance), steel ministry. however, this official does not have knowledge of how the sections function since he has an independent charge. if they wanted to make a proper assessment, the committee should have consulted the joint secretaries under the steel secretary,"" the officials said. allegations are flying thick and fast. some feel the recommendations had been influenced by the three integrated steel producers tata steel, steel authority of india ltd (sail) and rashtriya ispat nigam ltd (rinl) - the combined might attempting to cripple the secondary producers. ""they are using the confederation of indian industry's platform to create a pressure group on the government. since we protect the interests of secondary producers, they want the link severed,"" jpc officials alleged. at present, the government sector of the steel industry constitutes only 33 per cent. moreover, the main producers - the three integrated steel companies that manufacture steel using the blast furnace route - produce only 42 per cent of the steel. of the rs 90,000 crore investment in the steel sector, secondary producers have pumped in nearly rs 55,000 crore. the officials further point out that the joint plant committee has suitably changed its agenda after deregulation of the industry and is continuously working to bridge the gap between the producers and end users. the jpc is now banking on representations to the steel and finance ministry by the secondary producers including new generation companies ispat, jindal, lloyd and essar as well as various associations.
