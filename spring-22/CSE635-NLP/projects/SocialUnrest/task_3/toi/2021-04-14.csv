0,"Once more, China tightens monetary policy","HONG KONG: China''s central bank tightened monetary policy for the second time in less than three weeks, trying to put the brakes on bank lending and property speculation as top officials voice concern that the economy may be overheating.

""Excessive growth in the supply of credit can initiate inflation or froth in property prices, which may eventually cause bad debts and increase financial risk,"" the central bank warned in a statement on Monday.

The latest tightening takes form of higher reserve requirements for banks. The action accompanied the release of figures late on Sunday showing that China ran a trade deficit in March for the third month in a row.

The deficit, though modest at $540 million, makes it more likely that China will continue resisting pressure from the US, Europe and Japan to let its currency rise, even as vice-president Dick Cheney visits Beijing on Tuesday, economists said. The deficit may also make China more reluctant to compromise in Washington this month when it holds trade talks on semiconductors and other goods.

The official New China News Agency reported on Sunday that China''s State Council, as the cabinet is called, called for strict curbs on new construction after a meeting on Friday led by Wen Jiabao, China''s prime minister. Wen recently warned publicly that bringing the Chinese economy under control this year would be even harder than last year''s fight against Sars.

The State Council concluded that while rapid economic growth had yielded benefits for many Chinese, there were ""some serious problems during economic performance,"" including ""overgrowth of investment, too many new construction projects, blind or overlapped construction efforts,"" the news agency said. ""The overheating problems in some sectors have imposed pressure on coal, power, oil and transport supplies and resultingly brought about rises in prices for raw materials and other necessities, according to the meeting.""

Investment spending has been rising at nearly three times the rate of overall economic growth lately, while consumer spending has lagged, raising fears that China may be erecting new factories and apartment buildings faster than they can be put to use.

What remains unclear is how much China could control public dissatisfaction if growth slowed sharply.

Officials in Singapore are also worried about inflation. The Monetary Authority of Singapore, the central bank, changed its currency policy on Monday after estimating that the economy had grown 7.3% faster in the first quarter of this year than a year earlier, and had expanded by 11% from the fourth quarter of last year.

Raising inflation forecast to a range of 1.5% percent to 2%, from a previous range of 0.5% to 1.5%, Monetary Authority surprised investors by announcing it would allow ""gradual appreciation"" of the Singapore dollar against the American dollar. This step should in theory make Singapore''s imports cheap.

1,Parsis protest desecration of well,"MUMBAI: For the first time in recent history, over 2,000 Zoroastrians held a candlelight vigil at Azad Maidan on Tuesday night to protest the recent vandalising of the ancient Bhikha Behram well near Churchgate.

They were accompanied by members of other communities as well.

On March 11, unidentified miscreants smashed the rare stained-glass panels in the canopy covering the 279-year-old well.

The peace-loving community, which is not known to make its grievances public, decided to hold this unique protest after the police failed to trace the culprits a month after the incident.

The vigil began with prayers for peace recited by heads of different religious groups. This was followed by the singing of the Parsi anthem in Gujarati.

""We have assembled here only to make people aware of this incident and encourage them to come forward with any information that they might have about who desecrated the place,"" said Mehernosh Fitter, a volunteer at the gathering.

""We wish to question how a sacred monument like this could be attacked and what protection other communities can expect in similar conditions,"" said Pearl Patel, a participant.

Former police commissioner Julio Rebeiro, who was also present, said he was overwhelmed by the number of people who had shown up.

""The vandalising of the Bhika Behram well comes after the ransacking of the Bhandarkar institute in Pune and we would like to know why this is happening to our heritage structures,"" said Rebeiro.

He told TNN that lawlessness had been patronised for too long and the protest was to bring this to the notice of the authorities.

The gathering was also addressed by Zoroastrian scholar Khojeste Mistree, former cabinet secretary B G Deshmukh and environmentalist Pheroza Godrej.

Mistree said that the well had been a sanctuary for the community for centuries and its vandalisation had caused deep anguish to all Parsis.

Pervez Damania, the former boss of Damania Airways, said, ""It''s only the lethargy of the authorities that has resulted in no action being taken against the culprits.""

2,Dry spell hits Maharashtra farmers,"SANGLI: Destiny and drought, says Bhimro Ramchandra Kumbhar, have conspired to destroy him.

Life used to be very different for this proud sugarcane farmer from Sangli. Only two years ago, he earned more than two lakh annually from his ten acres of fertile land in Hingangao village in Kadegaon taluka.

But with the dry spell showing no signs of letting up in its third consecutive year, and with hunger gnawing away at his family of six-not to mention his pride - the 40-year old farmer is desperate.

Kumbhar and his wife Chhaya, once members of the rural middle-class, are now labourers, digging trenches and farm ponds in the murderous western Maharashtra heat.

For nine hours of work, they earn Rs 22 a day each, plus five kg of wheat under the state-sponsored Employment Guarantee Scheme (EGS).

And while they work, all they can think of is water. Who will fill the water pots at home when the tanker comes to the village? What will their three children do without water when they come home from school? And the bigger question that will seal their fate: Will the rains ditch them again this year?

Perhaps even more poignant, because he is so much older, is the plight of Vithal Krishna Mane, a year away from 70. The toothless farmer-turned-EGS labourer slogs in the scorching heat on the dusty mountains of Yogewadi village in Tasgaon taluka.

""We used to grow sugarcane, grapes, wheat and jowar until recently,"" he relates angrily. ""There was a time when after all my farm expenses, I would still have Rs 1 lakh with me at the end of the season. Now I barely manage to buy my tambaku.""

Sangli is groaning under the load of unpaid loans. Vithal Baburao Mane is only 30 but the Rs 20,000 that he owes the Hingangaon-Mudri credit society is causing him sleepless nights.

""I am unable to pay,"" he explains simply. ""For the last two years, there has been no water.""

And to think that this used to be counted as one of the richest districts in the state.

""Two years ago, there were only 5,000 EGS labourers here. Now there are 56,000,"" says Manisha Mhaiskar, collector of Sangli.

The district is strongly represented in the government with home minister R R Patil, finance minister Jayant Patil, industries minister Patangrao Kadamand minister of state for irrigation Ajit Ghorpade originating from here.

This district has 11 sugar cooperatives. Thanks to the cultivation of this waterguzzling crop in the traditional manner, as many as eight of the ten talukas are scarcity-hit.

Local politicians are loath to let the farmers diversify into other sectors such as horticulture or floriculture since this would spell doom for the multi-crore sugar factory units controlled by them.

Politicians also fear that if any independent thinking takes place, it will deprive them of their vote-banks.

""Cane is the best crop for us since it does not require much effort to cultivate and the returns are very good,"" says Mane, unaware of the disastrous consequences that the sustained cultivation of cane causes.

""If the rains keep their date this year I will definitely go for cane cultivation.""

Meanwhile, the new EGS labourers are calling their labour the brown revolution. They dig away on the dark brown hillsides in the hope that their work will eventually lead to a green revolution.

The trenches and ponds, they hope, will act as catchment areas for water for their crops. But for that, the rains have to be faithful.

3,Election code lands govt in a jam,"HYDERABAD: The state road transport corporation is on full alert following a strike notice issued by the National Mazdoor Union (NMU), which has threatened to cripple the statewide network on April 15 and 16.

The NMU wants dearness allowance arrears, changes in punishment procedures for conductors, an amendment to the Motor Vehicles Workersâ€™ Act, regularisation of 6,000 casual workers and compassionate appointment of about 6,000 people in the transport utility.

The management has reportedly agreed to all major demands, barring those on regularisations and new appointments. But since the model code of conduct is in force, electoral authorities have objected to the government inking an agreement with the union, senior RTC sources said.

In a communication to the RTC on Tuesday, the state election authorities said the government must ensure that preparatory work for the elections arenâ€™t hit because of a possible transport strike.

This, they said, would go against the spirit of the Representation of the People (RP) Act. RTC buses will be used to move forces, transport people to public meetings, carry polling personnel and election material.

On Tuesday, chief secretary Mohan Kanda took stock of the situation and instructed the RTC vice-chairman and managing director to continue talks with union representatives and explain the Act to the union. Police and transport departments in the districts would be alerted to provide security to drivers, who want to run the services.

Kanda asked the RTC to operate more hired buses, engage home guards and others required to ensure that essential services are not paralysed. Corporation officials are confident that the union would relent.

This is probably for the first time in the stateâ€™s history that corporation employees have threatened a strike during elections.

Poll-time problem

â€¢The RTC is on alert as union issues strike notice

â€¢The management is ready to fulfill most of the demands

4,"Followers of Krishnappa, Sommana clash; 2 dead","BANGALORE: In a clash among Congress workers, two brothers were hacked to death at Padarayanapura on Tuesday night.

Followers of Bangalore (South) parliamentary constituency candidate M. Krishnappa (Cong) were attacked by supporters of Binnypet assembly candidate V. Somanna, leading to the two murders. Krishnappa was inaugurating an election office on Padarayanapura 8th Main road (near Mysore Road), when the incident occurred. Krishnappaâ€™s follower Althaf was attacked with swords by Somannaâ€™s followers Farooq, Imran, Sultan and Shabbeer. Althaf escaped with wounds, but his two brothers Amjad and Aejaz sustained stab injuries and were brought dead to Victoria Hospital. Althaf has been admitted to a private hospital. Farooq is the brother and Imran the son of Arif Pasha, a former corporator who joined the Congress along with Somanna recently.

Imran is a history sheeter.

Even Arif Pashaâ€™s name figures in the records of J.J. Nagar police station. Arif Pasha and Althaf, a rowdy-sheeter, have continued their enmity in the party too, by joining rival camps of Somanna and Krishnappa.

Krishnappa, a real estate magnate, too had tried for the Binnypet ticket, but twoterm MLA Somanna got it allotted. Krishnappa is now contesting against BJP state president Ananth Kumar.

Following the attack, commotion prevailed in Padarayanapura area and senior police officers, along with five platoons, rushed to the spot.

Chief minister S.M. Krishna, who is on Vijaya Dundhubi Yatra and camping at Raichur, called up police commissioner S. Mariswamy and enquired about the incident.

5,Hema doesn't feel good about politics,"PATNA: For dream girl Hema Malini, the Phulwari experience was not at all ""feel good"". In a talk with media persons while on a visit to the city to campaign for the BJP candidate, she said, ""I was bitten by mosquitoes which troubled me all the time"". Enacting the bug(ging) experience, she said flies got into her hair and danced on her face every time she opened her mouth to speak. ""Politics is all dust and grime,"" she added.

""Campaigning is a tough job. The crowds are dangerous and make me really scared. Contrary to films for which they have to pay, the crowds come in large numbers as they get to see me for free. She said films are so different. ""They give you a creative experience while politics is nothing but bhaashan,"" she remarked.

""I am a creative person. I can''t go to the slum and interact with people there as I am not capable of it. I can dance, I can act and I can do other such things which are my forte,"" she said.

She had other surprises in store. Asked about Sonia Gandhi, she was all praise for the lady. ""She is so hard working and is doing so much for the party. I really admire her for that,"" she said. She also finds RJD supremo Laloo Prasad Yadav ""interesting"". ""I am very keen to meet him. Once we saw each other in Rajya Sabha but he looked at me and then went the other away. No one introduced us to each other,"" she recalled.

She said she didn''t mind when Laloo made the comment that he will make the Patna roads as smooth as her cheeks. ""I took it in a humorous way,"" she said. She also said that no political party can exploit a film star if the person is smart enough. ""If someone uses my popularity with people, I will also use them,"" she said.

She, however, doesn''t feel happy about film stars joining the political bandwagon in large numbers. ""Most of them do it for free publicity. Ask some of the newcomers, they won''t even know about the party they are campaigning for,"" she said.

Hema may have joined politics, but her heart still throbs for cinema and dance which continue to be the ruling assions of her life. ""I want to do dance shows but no one invites me for that. They only call me for campaigning,"" she said.

6,Congress demands Tandon’s arrest,"LUCKNOW: Congress party, in a memorandum sent to chief election officer on Tuesday, demanded arrest of former minister for housing and urban development and the Prime Ministerâ€™s close confidant Lalji Tandon, holding him accountable for the death of 21 women during his birth day bash stampede on Monday.

Singed by the state unit in charge Chaudhary Virendra Singh , party media in charge Siraj Mehandi and others, it also demands stringent legal action against the candidate from the constituency for the gory incident which among other things, amounted to luring the electorate by offering them free gifts.

The memorandum lambasted Tandon for ""wilful negligence"" shown during the function hosted by him which led to the tragedy. Moreover, the distribution of saris in Lucknow where Vajpayee is expected to file his nomination on April 15, clearly violates section 1, 2, and 3 of the Representation of People Act, Congressmen have alleged. They also held the BJP leader guilty of not obtaining prior permission from the administration for holding the function.

Meanwhile, member of the Congress Working Committee Mohsina Kidwai who was in town on Tuesday also blamed the saffron party for the stampeded and demanded institution of a judicial inquiry into the incident.

7,"When farms yield gold, joy fills air","LUCKNOW: Farms are turning to gold and the sweet fragrance of harvest time is near, turning the air ripe with joy, hope, enthusiasm and festivity. This is the picture of the real India, a land of festivities and celebrations. And if the festival is linked to agriculture, celebrations become two-fold.

Baisakhi, is the celebration of harvest of winter crop, wheat. The day is also celebrated as the Prakasutsav, or the birth anniversary of the Khalsa faith. ""On the first day of the month of Baisakh in 1699 the Khalsa faith was born. It was on this day that Guru Govind Singh gave Amrit (nectar) to the Panj Piares (five religious men) and told them to fight the oppressor and the evil in society,"" explains RS Bagga, president of Lucknow Gurudwara Prabandhak Committee.

The Sikhs, therefore, emerged the warrior race to fight evil. ""Guru Govind, who had the surname Rai till then, changed it to ''Singh'', meaning the lion and instructed all Sikh men to take on the title,"" says Bagga. The followers of Sikhism were also given a special dress, they had to adorn the five essentials namely Kangha, Kesh, Kirpan, Kada and Kachcha.

Baisakhi is not limited to Sikhs. It is celebrated with much enthusiasm in Punjab.

The name derived from the month of Vaisakha (April-May), the cheerful reverberation of Jatta aai Basakhi can be heard as Punjabis celebrate with the traditional Bhangra dance. ""The day is celebrated with much fanfare amongst the farmers in Punjab as it marks he crucial harvest period,"" says Bagga. Gurudwaras across the city gear up for the day as the prayer ceremonies begin a day before Baisakhi. ""Procession led by the Panj Piaras is an important part of the celebration. We have many prayer ceremonies including Akhand Path of Guru Granth Sahib,"" Bagga adds.

Baisakhi is also an important day for Buddhists as it was on this day that Gautama Buddha attained enlightenment. Besides, it was on this day that Swami Dayanand Saraswati founded the Arya Samaj in 1875.

8,PU in grip of election fever,"PATNA: The forthcoming parliamentary elections have had their impact on the Patna University (PU) campus too. With only a week left for the D-Day (polling will be held on April 20 in Patna constituency), the teachers, non-teaching staff and students can be seen discussing the prospects of different political parties.

Even as a number of university staff have been deputed for election duties, the campus is agog with discussions centred around elections.

The university teachers can be found making calculations of seats likely to be bagged by the major political parties and discussing the issue of formation of government at the Centre. They are also worried about the expected violence during the elections.

Patna University, which has been a nerve-centre of many a political upheavals in the past, has fielded only three candidates for the Lok Sabha elections this time. They are Sanjay Paswan of labour and social welfare department, Rita Verma of Magadh Mahila College and Ranjan Prasad Yadav of geology department.

While Paswan and Verma are contesting elections on BJP ticket from Nawada and Dhanbad constituencies respectively, Sampoorna Vikas Dal president Yadav is contesting from Patna constituency.

Many PU teachers are actively campaigning for ensuring the victory of their favourite candidates.

Leaders of student organisations affiliated to different political parties are away from the campus these days, campaigning for the candidates belonging to their respective political parties. On the other hand, candidates contesting elections are also visiting different hostels on the campus.

The Joint Action Committee of Futab and Fustab has already decided to stage dharnas at Chapra and Madhepura from where RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav is contesting.

Teachers drawn from all over the state will stage dharna at Chapra on April 16 and 17 and expose the misdeeds of Laloo during the last 13 years. Dharna at Madhepura will be staged after April 25.

JAC convener A K P Yadav told TNN here on Monday that the RJD government had been responsible for the deplorable condition of higher education as well as university teachers in the state.

A white paper will be issued by the teachersâ€™ bodies educating the people of both the constituencies about the â€œdictatorialâ€� attitude of the RJD supremo towards the democratic institutions. Teachersâ€™ meetings have already been held at Chapra, Bhagalpur, Sultanganj, Muzaffarpur and some other places in this connection, Yadav said.

Patna University Teachersâ€™ Association (Puta) has not yet taken any decision in this regard.

A meeting of the Puta executive will be held here on April 16 to discuss the call of JAC, said general secretary Amar Nath Singh.

9,Vajpayee faces mafia pincers,"LUCKNOW: Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee is in for yet another embarrassment in his home constituency, the second in two months. Both incidents link his party to the mafia.

The first is western UP liquor don D P Yadavâ€™s induction into the BJP, due to which the PM had to face the mediaâ€™s furore. Now, it is the involvement of gangster Brijendra Murari Yadav, the official organiser of the disastrous sari show on Monday.

Though Vajpayee has publicly declared Tandonâ€™s birthday bash was not a party function, Lucknowites are not buying the story.

Yadav, a history-sheeter with 13 cases against him, is known for his prodigal lifestyle. His luxury house in Mahanagar is even called the local Taj Mahal.

The cases against him include three of murder, six of rioting and attempted murder and four of illegal possession of arms. At least seven cases are still pending; the status of the others is unclear. The first criminal case against him was registered in 1983, and the latest in 1996. He was detained under the National Security Act in 1992 and Gangster Act in 1996.

Assisting him in his deals is brother Yogendra Yadav, with 22 cases registered with the police.

Interestingly, the crime record of both the Yadav brothers came to a grinding halt after 1996. The reason was their growing political clout as Yadav developed close contacts with a few top politicians in the state before he finally hitched on to the saffron bandwagon.

11,Where development takes a back seat,"BARABANKI:In a constituency where the politics of caste determines the fate of a candidate developmental issues predictably take a back seat.

And so it is in the Barabanki (reserved) parliamentary constituency where ''bijli, pani and sadak'' have gone backstage compared to the more weighty issue of ''jati'' (caste).

In the fray are three Rawats (Pasi) and one Gautam fielded by the four mainstream political parties. Ram Sagar Rawat, a three time MP and currently a sitting one in the dissolved Lok Sabha has been repeated by the Samajwadi Party. Giving him competition is Kamla Prasad Rawat of the BSP, Ram Naresh Rawat of the BJP and Anand Prakash Gautam of the Congress.

All four are currently vying for the 34 per cent Dalit votes, 20 per cent Muslims, 13 per cent Kurmi, 12 per cent Yadav, 7 per cent Brahmin, 6 per cent Rajput and 8 per cent others votes.

On the face of it all four parties assidiously claim they do not believe in practising the politics of caste with the BJP also coining the slogan of ""jati, pati se nata todo, Bhajpa se rishta jodo"". The fact however is that all these parties are basing their calculations on the caste permutations and combinations and it is here that the SP candidate apparently appears better placed, his poor track record by way of developmental work during the earlier three tenures notwithstanding.

Sunder Lal Dixit a former BJP MLA says, ""Ram Sagar representated the constituency for three terms but the money was not spent on public welfare. Some accountability should be fixed as to where the ''sansad nidhi'' went?"". This is a issue which is being raked by Ram Sagar''s other opponents too, though the criticism has not had much effect on the candidate himself or his supporters as they hope and work for a fourth time win in a constituency which has traditionally been a stronghold of the Samajwadi Party socialist movement.

Barabanki was the ''karamsthali'' of the great socialist leader Ram Sewak Yadav whose name and contributions are still revered here. The seat had always fallen in the SP''s kitty except on two occasions. It went to the Congress when Indira Gandhi was assassinated in 1984 and later was bagged by the BJP when the Ram wave swept the country. Prior and since then it is the SP which has held sway here.

The SP candidate, unlike the two other Rawats, in the fray has the added advantage of belonging to the Rajpasi sub caste of the Pasis who far outnumber the Baurasi Pasi, to which the BJP and the BSP candidates belong. But it is the Kurmi vote which is apparently troubling Ram Sewak the most.

The Kurmis who number around 75,000 are reportedly tilting towards the BJP candidate and if they finally decide to throw their lot behind Ram Naresh Rawat, it would spell trouble for the Ram Sewak.

The SP candidate however has turned for help to the biggest stature Kurmi leader of the region Beni Prasad Verma.The Thakurs peeved with the BJP over the Raja Bhaiyya episode are also known to sympathise with the SP. This has caused some problems for the saffron party which has raised the Atal mascot to win votes.

States the BJP city president Rajesh Arora ""this is not a fight for the party or the candidate but for Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Atal ji ke izzat ka saawal hai"". For the BSP the Barabanki seat is a step towards the kendra sarkar ka kabza states its district president Vijay Kumar who follows his observation with the one liner ""Jiski jitni sankhiya bhari, utni uski hissedari"".

And so while the constituency has gone slow on the poster, buntings and cut out front the stress currently by these candidates is on public meetings and `jan sampark''.

12,BJP ready with new election message,"NEW DELHI: As the BJP gears up to unleash it first real campaign, its messages are woven around the thought that while the party is proud of its achievements in five years of government, there is a lot to be done and till it doesnâ€™t fulfil the promises it has made for the next five years, it or the country and the people are not going to stop.

Not till they connect by road every town, every village. Not till they fufill their dream for India in every field, be it health, education, power, water, telephones. Any and every sphere. In all the ads, the principal communicator is the PM, says the IIT- and Cornell-trained Ajay Singh, who is coordinating the campaign scripted by party chief Venkaiah Naidu and leaders Arun Jaitley and Pramod Mahajan.

The campaign line they hope everyone can identify with comes from Prime Minister Vajpayee: â€œIf a billion people get together, there is nothing they cannot achieve.â€�

In Hindi, itâ€™s now sau crore chalenge, mahashakti banenge.

The electronic campaign hits the political pole as well. In comes, then, the issue of stability.

The party is pointing to the chinks â€” six PMs in the 10 years before its government, one PM in six years and linking this to peace and progress with an appeal for a strong mandate.

Some more films may be on the way, pointing possibly to the past of long queues and a black market before zooming to the present, with the inexperience of the main oppositionâ€™s leadership. There can be no comparison on this front, says Singh.

The mere matter of campaign cost can be shrugged off. Fairly nominal, we are told. Nothing close to what is being speculated.
