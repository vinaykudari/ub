0,Congress and Marxist party two sides of a coin: Naidu,"KOCHI: Terming the Congress and Marxist party as two sides of the same coin, BJP President M Venkaiah Naidu today said the electorate would waste their vote if they cast it for either of these parties.

Speaking at the election convention in support of V Vishwanatha Menon, the independent candidate supported by the NDA for the coming bypoll to the Ernakulam Lok Sabha seat, he alleged both the Congress and Marxist party were betraying the people of Kerala. Both these parties, which are fighting the elections are united once they come to Delhi, he said.

""Both Congress and Marxist who fight in day time comes together in the night,"" he said, adding their slogan was ""Delhi mein dosti, Kolkata aur Kerala mein gusti.""

Coming down on Marxist party, he said ""unfortunately what is seen today was in the last four or five years it has left its ideology and was ready to forego its identity and was ready to become the ''B'' team of the Congress party.""

The Marxist party which had accused Congress for corruption, unemployment, capitalism and for all the problems of the country during its 47 years rule are now projecting Sonia Gandhi as an ''experienced'' and ''able'' leader, he said.

NDA government led by A B Vajpayee was committed to a common agenda with a common principle and was taking the country forward to progress he said adding the opposition will not be able to put up an alternative.

The NDA government during its short term of five years had achieved development in all sectors including IT, telecommunication, agriculture and automobile, he added.

Alleging that Kashmir issue, insurgency, terrorism, separatism and infiltration were all byproducts of Congress regime, Naidu claimed that the gap in the development field between rural and urban areas had widened due to Congress misrule.

Terming the approach of both Congress and the Marxist camp as ''oppotunistic'', Naidu urged the people of Kerala to think seriously for the future and make a new beginning.

Referring to the factional feud in Congress, he said ''it is not a family election or a issue of A K Antony and Karunakaran. It is a political election ''.

Emphasising the need for a change in the alignment of political forces in Kerala, he said let the bypoll be a new beginning for the change.

''We do not want to rule the country by religion'' he said adding ''we are concerned about the culture and identity of the country. We are least worried about the religion, which is personal''.

Detailing the achievements of the NDA government, he said it had given 3.42 crore telephone connections, 3.30 crore LPG gas connection and by 2007 every road in the villages would be connected to the main roads.

O Rajagopal, Union minister of state for Defence, said this was the first time a three -cornerned contest was being witnessed in Kerala. The states'' political scenario had come to a turning point, he added.

P C Thomas, Union Miniser of State for Law and Justice and IFDP leader, said Menon''s victory would help boost the developmental activities which were taking place in the city.

1,Three cops held for trying to frame ex-minister,"AHMEDABAD: The CID (Crime) on Sunday arrested three police inspectors, including one from its own ranks, for implicating transporters of Bhavnagar by furnishing false evidence.

The three had also allegedly tried to frame former state minister and senior Congress leader Shaktisinh Gohil in a criminal offence.

Pramod Kumar, IG (crime) told TNN: ""The PIs have been booked under section 195 of the IPC. They have been found guilty of being part of a conspiracy that had implicated innocent persons.""

Kumar was referring to the arrest of three transporters associated with Gujarat Travels based in Bhavnagar. K R Jadeja PI with CID (crime), H R Jadeja and H M Patel who are PIs at Bhavnagar, were nabbed for the concocting a murder conspiracy leading to the arrest of the three transporters.

According to investigating officials, a case of dacoity had been registered with the Vartej police station by A K Gohil at Bhavnagar in March 2003. Gohil, a transporter, had alleged that robbers had looted valuables from his brother''s residence.

After this complaint was filed, Gohil allegedly met K R Jadeja, then a PSI in Bhavnagar, and sought his help to frame charges against his rival transporters associated with Gujarat Travels. Police sources disclosed that in a pre-planned manner, a bus conductor based in Bhavnagar, Khuman Singh, was tutored by the PIs and Gohil to come up with false evidence against Gujarat Travels'' associates. Singh was promised Rs 1 lakh for the task.

Based on Singh''s alleged statements and evidence proving that he had overheard Gohil''s rivals plotting to get him bumped off, the police then nabbed three persons from Gujarat Travels in May.

But after the job was done, Singh, according to his own confession, was not paid by his ""employers"". Instead, he was allegedly illegally detained and beaten up by the PIs in order to pressurise him to falsely implicate the former minister in the plot.

Feeling threatened, Singh then approached the CID (crime) who investigated and cracked the case.

9,'CM must reconsider state energy policy',"LUCKNOW: The Vidyut Karamchari Sanyukt Sangharsh Samiti (Uttar Pradesh) has appealed chief minister (CM) Mulayam Singh Yadav to reconsider the energy policy and institute a high level inquiry into the alleged scams carried out in the name of improving the energy sector.

The samiti office-bearers, including Shailendra Dubey, AK Singh, SB Singh, VK Trivedi and others have alleged that the scams involving crores of rupees took place in the three corporations and UP Electricity Regulatory Commission in the name of carrying reforms.

Requesting the CM to ensure that the workers were consulted on the issues involving policy matters, the members stated that the changes effected in the name of reforms be reconsidered.

They said the need of the hour was to dismiss the management which was responsible for destroying the energy sector, and vest power in the hands of trained people. They added that the experiment of appointing bureaucrats and retired officers to the top posts had failed, and should be discontinued.

10,Outer space a challenge for law making: Kasturirangan,"BANGALORE: Dr K Kasturirangan, MP and Former ISRO Chairman said that outer space poses formidable challenges such as issues of regulation of debris and intellectual property rights in space for law making.

The issue of convergence which technological advances have brought about keeping pace with the rapid changes which it brings about in structure and functions of society are also great challenges, he added.

He was delivering his address at the 11th Convocation of the National Law School of India University (NLSIU) here on Sunday where among those present were Chief Justice of India V N Khare and some High Court judges.

""Developments in cyber space will continue to offer you great challenges in lawmaking, as the impact of information technologies further unfold and pressure for global approach to legal norms and structures grow further,"" Dr Kasturirangan said.

He said India should continue to be an active participant addressing legal questions of outer space as it is one of the few countries which made a great mark in the field of space technology.

A mission to moon and subsequent planetary programmes by India will give India its rightful place to participate in future legal work and other international endeavours for exploration of planets, he said.

The proposed moon mission, apart from its scientific and technical challenges and other benefits in terms of international co-operation, Dr Kasturirangan said, will also be significant from a legal perspective.

""As the Moon Treaty evoked limited response and not ratified by major space powers, there are several open questions on the rights of states regarding the exploitation of natural resources on moon,"" he said.

NLSIU Director, Dr Jayagovind said in his report that their focus would be on developing a rigorous LL.M programme in areas of business laws and Human Rights in the years to come.

Stating that NLSIU has demonstrated that its students are second to none and that they could stand up to international competition, Dr Jayagovind said that all six national law schools should come together and develop a national strategy to meet the new challenge.

During the awards ceremony, Shyamkrishna Balganesh bagged four gold medals - University first rank, meritorious student and in areas of professional ethics and intellectual property law. Twelve others too were awarded medals under various categories.

Over 140 degrees in PhD, BA LLB, LLM and diploma were awarded by CJI V N Khare at the occasion.

11,Majority of students not interested in polls,"LUCKNOW: Entry of criminal elements in the election fray in large numbers has deterred over 90 per cent of the 27,000 strong general student population, mostly day scholars, from participating in the students union election process so far.

Despite this fact, student leaders are trying every trick in the book to woo voters by showering gifts on the electorate and impressing students through their high profile election campaign.

Says Deepti Srivastava, a BSc I student: ""We were excited when the elections were announced, but the way criminals and hooligans are roaming around, neither I would like to come to vote, nor my parents would allow."" The elections have been mainly reduced to ''hostel elections'' and main participants are around 5000 hostel residents and day scholars are nowhere in the picture, said Alok Mishra, a BA II student.

A section of student leaders believe the opportunity could be utilised by the general students to vote out criminal elements. Says, Bajrangi Singh Bajju, a candidate for president, ""We are asking students to come and vote to increase participation of general students, no matter who they vote."" Shantanu Sharma, another candidate said, ""General students should analyse and vote against muscle and money power.""

There is a special focus on girl students as they are 60 per cent of the electorate. There are three girls hostels with a total strength of around 2000. Student leaders have come up with various strategies to woo girl hostel residents. Another candidate for president has formed a team of ""smart handsome"" boys, who have been particularly deployed for campaigning amid girls and in the girls hostels. Another has become ""bhayyia"" and has been asking girls to tie rakhies on his wrist.

Few candidates have ordered for scented cards and flowers to be distributed exclusively among girls. Another has planned to distribute duppattas and other accessories. Few chhatra netas (belonging to age group 35-40 years and have ''kids'' who are of the age of a first-year student) have given charge to their wives and girl friends to muster support for them in girls hostels. Major student organisations like ABVP and SFI have put up girl candidates.

Interestingly, some student leaders feel that campaigning among girls is a waste of time because they rarely vote and boys reject leaders having ""girl savvy"" image. Such student leaders have a ''bonanza'' offer for boys. From a ""day out in a water park or resort"" to ""free dining in top restaurants"" and ""visits to bar and free liquor"" to ""concessional cinema tickets"" and ""branded outfits and shoes on discount"" and much more is being offered to male voters.

Assurance about ""sure protection"" from the police and university authorities, if caught ""eve-teasing"" or during an ""extortion bid"" has been given to male supporters by these student leaders, besides promises to supply muscle power and arms to boys who want to settle scores with their rival.

The boys in the hostels are divided on regional and caste lines. While a division of east and west UP is clearly visible, Thakhur, Brahmin and backward configurations also count in elections. Most of these students are from rural or interior localities and have strong political bias. Urban fancy stuff does not attract them.

12,"DNAs match, Tripathi arrested","LUCKNOW: The Madhumita murder case moved considerably forward on Sunday with the arrest of former minister Amarmani Tripathi from his Lawrence Terrace residence in Hazratganj by the Central Bureau of Investigations (CBI).

The arrest follows confirmation that his DNA matched that of Madhumita''s foetus tested in a laboratory in Hyderabad. Amarmani is being charged for murder, conspiracy, tampering evidence and fabricating false evidence to mislead investigators. Soon after his arrest, Amarmani was taken for medical exmaination as per norms to Ram Manohar Lohia Hos pital in Indiranagar and admitted to Gandhi ward of the CSMMU well past mid-night.

It may be recalled that The Times of India had earlier stated in a report that a Hyderabad expert had confirmed that the DNA tested positive. On Sunday evening, the CBI team first questioned Amarmani for nearly an hour before serving the arrest warrant. He was quizzed about his associates who were involved in the murder and as to why he had been evading CBI calls the whole of last week. The former minister it is understood had installed call identifiers to avoid taking calls from the investigators.

The arrest of Amarmani saw some showdown as he accused the premier investigating agency of poor standards. ""CBI ki jaanch ka stur Lucknow police aur CB CID se bhi battar hai,"" (The level of CBI investigations was worse than that of Lucknow police and CB CID) Amarmani said as the sleuths escorted him towards the waiting vehicles even as Madhumani stood watching her husband being taken away.

At about 6 pm on Sunday Amarmani convened a press conference at his residence and told jounalists that he was being dragged into the Madhumita murder case as a result of a deep-rooted conspiracy. The former minister in the erstwhile Mayawati cabinet denied any association with the crime. ""I cannot face my children and relatives because of the baseless reports being published in the media about my involvement in the murder case,"" he said putting a hapless expression on his face.

He even went to the extent of charging the media of creating an unnecessary hype which, he alleged, was a compelling factor for the CBI to grill him extensively though this was not needed. Just as the short press-conference concluded at around 6:25 pm, a team of CBI headed by deputy superintendent of police (Dy SPs) CBI T Balaji and Hari Shanker Singh along with six of their subordinates walked into the house. After some quizzing, the CBI began the formalities of his arrest which ended at 8:40 pm following which, he was taken to the CBI''s Indiranagar office here. The probe was headed by DIG CBI Loknath Behera.

Sources said that apart from being charged of murder, he would also be booked for fabricating false evidence for his acts related to floating the theory of Madhumita''s November 2002 marriage with the IIT Kanpur student Anuj Misra. Sources said that the priest Ganga Narain Dixit who went on record before a news channel and the journalist of a local Hindi daily to claim that he had solemnised the marriage of Madhumita and Anuj would also be booked for fraud and creating false evidence.

This part of the investigation would also comprise the role of two police officers earlier posted in the state capital who had gone out of their way to pick-up Anuj from IIT Kanpur and interrogate him, allegedly forcing him to admit his marriage with the poetess who was shot dead at her Paper Mill colony residence in Nishatganj here on May 9 last.

13,CBI arrests 4 officials in Salem passport case,"HYDERABAD: The CBI has held four officials, including two policemen, responsible for issuing passports to underworld don Abu Salem, his girlfriend Monica Bedi and another woman.

Salem and Bedi were caught in Lisbon last September while travelling on the fake passports they secured citing a fictitious address in Kurnool. A case was registered against the officials responsible for issuing the passports.

Later, the case was handed over to the CBI,which sent related documents to the government examiner of questioned documents two months ago, sources in the CBI said, adding the GEQD sent its report last week.

Experts at the GEQD tested the documents and fixed four officials â€” assistant sub-inspector S A Sattar, typist in the district police office G Srinivasa Rao, senior assistant in the revenue office Mohammed Younus, postman D Gokri Saheb and private passport agent B Abdul Gaffar.

The documents were prepared and signed and police clearance certificate was given for the applicants based on which the passport office issued passports to three applicants, sources said.

Based on the report, the CBI will go ahead with the investigation and charge the officials, sources said.

14,Opp gears up to attack govt,"HYDERABAD: The fake stamp paper scam and the High Court''s recent remark against a murder-tainted minister are the two issues which the opposition plans to fiercely take up to launch an attack against the ruling TDP during the monsoon session of the Legislative Assembly beginning on Monday.

The ruling party, on its part, is putting together a list of Congress MLAs with criminal background to launch a counter-attack.

It is learnt that the TDP may not take action against the two legislators â€” C Krishna Yadav and P Ramasubba Reddy â€” who have been in the news recently for having criminal backgrounds. For, the ruling party has as many as 11 sitting MLAs and two MPs with criminal records.

According to police records, TDP MLAs S Raghurami Reddy from Mydukur, N Mula Reddy from Anaparthy, Thota Trimurthulu from Ramachandrapuram, B Bhaskara Rama Rao from Peddapuram, B Seetharami Reddy from Atmakur, Byreddy Rajasekhar Reddy from Nandikotkur, Gattu Bheemudu from Gadwal, Y Chandrasekhar from Jadcherla and P Mahender Reddy from Tandur, also figure in the list apart from Lok Sabha members Bhooma Nagi Reddy and Karanam Balaram Murthy.

But the state government had issued ""government orders"" withdrawing the cases against them.

After Krishna Yadav became a minister in 1999, the government not only withdrew some cases against him, but his name was also deleted from the list of history sheeters, a document of the intelligence department points out.

Most of these tainted public representatives are facing murder and attempt-to-murder charges, while a couple of them were even convicted by the lower courts and were sentenced to undergo imprisonment.

However, these ""highly influential"" legislators either managed to ""secure"" orders from a higher court setting aside the lower court verdict or are fighting a legal battle in higher courts for ""securing"" a reprieve.

It is, therefore, unlikely that action would be taken against Krishna Yadav and Ramasubba Reddy.

In the Opposition, four Congress legislators are facing criminal charges. Kadiam legislator, J Ram Mohan Rao, is listed as A-category history sheeter,was accused in 36 cases including murder.Most of these were either withdrawn by the government or he was acquitted by the court.

Factionist Challa Ramakrishna Reddy, MLA from Koilakuntla was facing charges in 19 criminal cases but he was acquitted in 17 cases. Another factionist and Congress MLA from Dharmavaram K Surya Pratap Reddy is accused in murder and several other cases, while Shadnagar MLA Shankar Rao is facing charges for interfering with electoral process.

15,CPM party 'purge' to spare none,"KOLKATA: Belatedly though, the CPM state committee has finally woken up to the organisational rot that local chieftains â€” from Dulal Banerjee to B.D. Singh â€” had bared it to over the years.

The ""misdeeds"" of the loose cannons in the party have made the state secretariat sit up and think about ways to haul up the leaders, high up in the party district secretariat or the state committee, who have been encouraging these activities for narrow political ends.

The CPM central committee had detected the impending threat way back in 1996, but the purging process was far from what was desired. State CPM secretary Anil Biswas made it clear to the state committee on Sunday that the clean-up process should start with the state committee itself. State committee members Subhas Chakraborty and Amitava Nandy were present at the meeting.

All state committee members, from Rajdeo Goala of Kolkata to Santimoy Bhattacharya of South 24-Parganas, have endorsed the secretariat note. Biswas said the note would come out in print, along with the suggestions of the state committee.

Biswas didn''t take names but he proposed a ""faceless disciplinary process"" that would take errant members to task, irrespective of their position in the party hierarchy. Once the state committee has approved the draft, Alimuddin Street plans to go the whole hog against these leaders without the least hindrance from the district party or any individual.

CPM politburo member Prakash Karat appealed to the state committee to take up the purging ""without bias or prejudice"", because he believed that it would help the central committee enforce discipline in other state party units as well.

In a note to the state committee members, Biswas explained how the 26 years of Left rule, despite its ""role in building mass movements"" had led to ""erosion of communist values."" He referred to instances where a few leaders used the party for personal gains, and indulged in factionalism to save their skin. ""Most activists in the grassroots level are against such unethical activities.

But most often they prefer to lie low fearing how the leaders would react to their criticism,"" says the secretariat note. Biswas referred to cases where influential leaders collected public donations without receipt during elections and didn''t bother to inform the district party.

This has led to serious ""deviations"", giving birth to a new breed of partymen who feel that they are accountable only to the individual or the faction he leads, instead of the party. One just has to look at Dulal Banerjee to realise that the state secretariat couldn''t have delayed the ""purge"" any further.

Banerjee still enjoys overriding influence in most local committees in the Cossipore-Belgachhia zone even days after he was sentenced a life term by the court. ""There are cases where party committees didn''t take up complaints against members in right earnest because of his political clout,"" says the secretariat note.

19,Vajpayee lacks political will: VHP,"NAGPUR: Alleging that Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee ''lacked political will to take initiative on Ram temple issue'', the VHP on Monday demanded BJP come out of NDA.

""Vajpayee lacks political will to construct a Ram temple at Ayodhya and the party (BJP) will have to pay a heavy price for that,"" VHP leader Ashok Singhal told reporters here adding BJP should come out of NDA.

Singhal said, ""when the Vajpayee government could muster support of its allies in NDA to defeat the no-trust motion introduced by Congress recently in Parliament, what prevents them from taking initiative in Ram temple issue?""

Ridiculing the Centre''s approach for not bringing a resolution on banning cow slaughter in the country, he said the mass movement on Ram temple would only decide the issue.

To a suggestion that since Vajpayee was concerned about his image, he was probably not taking up the Ram temple issue, Singhal shot back that the ""image of Lord Ram was greater than that of Vajpayee. His (Vajpayee) personality is creating a hurdle in the issue.""

""Atalji ek kalakar hai"" (Atalji is an artist), he said without elaborating.

""The temple issue is a religious movement and VHP will not allow any political party to derive political mileage out of it. It is political adultery,"" Singhal said.

""It was improper to seek votes in the name of Ram (temple issue) and forget the issue later,"" Singhal said reiterating ""they are committing political adultery.""

""Our fight is against Islamic terrorism (jehadi) and the secular forces which were opposed to mandir in Ayodhya.""

He termed the NDA led by BJP and Parliament as stumbling blocks on way to construction of the temple at Ayodhya.

""The doors of compromise (with Muslims) and Judiciary look closed now,"" Singhal said questioning the rejection of a formula by Kanchi Seer Swami Jayendra Saraswati by the All India Muslim Personnel Law Board.

""I do not think any court can decide the Ram temple issue,"" Singhal said and criticised the communist historians for distorting the facts.

On Human Resource Development Minister Murli Manohar Joshi''s resignation from the Cabinet after the Rae Bareli court order, he said the BJP leader has done ""some home work... to rewrite the Indian history.""

On the acquittal of Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani, Singhal said, ""from the way he has been acquitted, it seems all of us will be acquitted in future.""

He described Advani as a ""cultural freedom fighter"" for his ""role in the whole episode.""

Singhal was here to attend the funeral of senior RSS Leader Moropant Pingle.
