0,Trust protests slaughter of animals,"PATNA: The Mahabir Temple Trust has taken up issue against the regular slaughter of animals at the famous Lord Baidyanath temple at Deoghar. Animals are slaughtered in the temple on each Tuesday, Saturday and â€œAmawasyaâ€� (dark night) day.

The trust has decided to generate awareness among the people and devotees with regard to the regular slaughter of animals by the Lord Shiva temple authorities.

The slaughters go unabated even on Ramnavami, Janmashtami, Shivratri, Deepawali, Chhath or any other festival. Throughout the month of Srawan (commencing from July-end this year), when even non-vegetarian devotees turn vegetarian, the slaughter ritual continues unabated in the temple.

Speaking to mediapersons on the Mahabir temple premises here, secretary of the Mahabir Mandir Kishore Kunal appealed to the devotees of Lord Shiva to generate a strong public opinion against slaughtering of animals. He further said that the devotees should see to it that no creature is slaughtered on the temple premises in the name of religion. Besides, devotees should not even make cash offerings to someone else for slaughtering of animals.

Kunal, who is also the vice-chancellor of the Kameshwar Singh Sanskrit University, Darbhanga, said that according to an estimate at least 100 innocent animals are brutally slaughtered each month on the premises of Lord Shivaâ€™s temple and that the act is done in the name of religion. A sum of approximately Rs 1 lakh is spent by the temple management on purchase of goats and that the money comes from the devoteesâ€™ offerings, he added.

Kunal, who is also a member of the 12-member Deoghar Temple Management Board (as per the directive of the Jharkhand High Court), said the governor of Jharkhand, too, had initiated a series of measures when he was the chief secretary of Rajasthan. It was in this background that many states like Gujarat and Rajasthan imposed a complete ban on animal sacrifice, he added.

The protagonists of these brutal killings claim that Lord Shiva temple is a â€œShakti-peethâ€�. As such, slaughter of animals is justified and part of the rituals. Some of them even go to the extent of claiming that the â€œmother worshipâ€� is conducted through the â€œpanch makarasâ€� â€” Mansa (meat), Min (fish), Maithun (sex), Madira (wine) and Mudra (posture). â€œThey forget that if these five â€˜makarasâ€™ are really followed the temples will turn into brothels and slaughter houses. As per some of the ancient texts of this cult, the â€œnara baliâ€� (sacrifice of human beings) is the best sacrifice to please the deity. â€œShould they be allowed in the name of religion?â€� he asked.

Former vice-chancellor of Kameshwar Singh Sanskrit University Kashi Nath Mishra and Mahant of the Mahabir temple Acharya Uddhav Das, who were also present at the press conference, felt the urgent need to ban the slaughtering of animals.

2,Kalraj clueless about inclusion in Union cabinet,"LUCKNOW: Former BJP state president Kalraj Mishra said on Wednesday that he had no knowledge about his induction into the Union cabinet in the July 1 expansion.

Speculations were rife about his induction into the Union cabinet following acceptance of his resignation and appointment of Vinay Katiyar as his successor. A report claimed that he had been asked to accompany the prime minister, who is on a two-day visit to Lucknow, when the latter returns to Delhi.

But Kalraj scotched rumours saying that he had not been intimated by any central leader so far. â€œI donâ€™t have any idea about it. I have a programme to visit Ayodhya on June 29 along with Vinay Katiyar,â€� said Mishra keeping his fingers crossed over the July 1 expansion.

3,BJP ministers decide to act tough,"LUCKNOW: The Bharatiya Janata Party on Thursday took a strong exception to chief minister Mayawatiâ€™s attempt to reverse yet another decision of the Rajnath government. After a furore in Thursdayâ€™s cabinet meeting, the decision to revert to the old system of appointment of clerks under Group C was deferred. The matter is now likely to be placed before Prime Minister Vajpayee on Friday morning when the chief minister calls on him.

Senior BJP ministers Lalji Tandon, Om Prakash Singh and Hukum Singh strongly opposed the CM move. During the Rajnath Singh regime, powers from departmental heads were withdrawn and appointments were centralised.

Accordingly, a massive state-level examination was held for 40,000 vacancies in Group C. About 5 lakh candidates appeared for one of the biggest ever competitive examinations in the state.

After selection of candidates, appointment letters were issued to about 3,000. Following a stay, the selection was put to hold.A wordy dual reportedly ensued between the BSP and BJP ministers when the CM brought up the suggestion. After the fiasco on the quota within quota policy, the BJP ministers did not play ball this time. Apparently because they viewed it as a ploy to open more avenues for appointment of Dalits in the government jobs.

Highly-placed sources claimed that the chief minister is taking the same plea which she had taken in the case of quota policy to make the BJP fall in line. She is learnt to have said that due to the court stay, no appointments could be made resulting in difficulties in functioning of government offices. If the government reverts back to the old policy, the stay would automatically be vacated paving way for fresh appointments.

A drive is already on to appoint about 28,000 Dalits in state services.

10,Walia opposes govt's eviction order,"NEW DELHI: Delhi State Urban Development Minister A K Walia has locked horns with his Union government counterpart over retaining his sprawling ministerial bungalow on Rouse Avenue.

Walia alleged that he was being forced to vacate the house which Union urban development minister Ananth Kumar wants for setting up a family court.

Walia said the Centre wanted to set up a family court in his bungalow without allotting him alternative accommodation. â€˜â€˜I was allotted this bungalow after the Congress government came to power in Delhi in 1998. Without consulting me, the land and building department decided to use the property to set up a family court,â€™â€™ he said.

Walia was sent a letter to vacate the bungalow on April 18 this year. Refusing to vacate, he wrote to the Union urban development ministry on April 22. Walia said the location of his bungalow was ideal for him as it was near his workplace in Delhi Sachivalaya at ITO.

In his reply, Anant Kumar expressed inability to provide alternative accommodation citing acute shortage of government bungalows.
