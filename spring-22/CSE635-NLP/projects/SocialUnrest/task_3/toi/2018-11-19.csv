0,Terror law shadow over 30 key Bills,"new delhi: the government has set itself an ambitious task for the winter session of the parliament: passing 30 bills in just 23 sittings - which includes five private members' days. the level of its success depends on how much time is spent discussing the controversial anti-terrorism ordinance, which tops the government's agenda. several opposition parties, including the congress, the left, the samajwadi party and the rashtriya janata dal continue to resist the poto stoutly. the government has raised much hue and cry about the number of bills, particularly those relating to economic, patents and other issues that have been pending with the standing committees for a year or two. certain key legislations, however, have been pending for more. like the constitution (83rd amendment) bill, which seeks to provide free and compulsory education to all children between six to 14 years, which has been pending for four years. same goes for the constitution (93rd amendment) bill, 2001, which makes free and compulsory education a fundamental right. somewhat similar is the case of central vigilance commission bill, 1999, which seeks to provide for setting up a central vigilance commission to probe or institute probes into offences under the prevention of corruption act, 1988. the joint committee had presented its report regarding this to the lok sabha on november 22, 2000. then there are bills like the constitution (85th amendment) bill, 1999, which seeks to reserve a third of the seats in the lok sabha and state legislatures for women. the standing committee had cleared the bill but political consensus on it is still to come. official sources admit that the bill has no chance of being passed in this session either, but it has been listed as a matter of form. other important legislations the government hopes to pass this time includes: * the landmark freedom of information bill, 2000, which seeks to provide people access to information under the control of public authorities, in order to promote openness, transparency and accountability in administration; * the controversial election laws (amendment) bill, 2001, which will end the practice of secret ballot in rajya sabha elections to prevent use of money power and cross-voting; * the constitution (92nd amendment) bill, which will provide consequential seniority to government servants belonging to sc/st category in case of promotion by virtue of the rules of reservation; * the explosive substances (amendment) bill, which will amend the parent act to provide for more stringent punishment in cases of use of rdx, pent etc, an important law in the current security environment; * the multi-state cooperative societies bill, 2000, which will give more functional autonomy to multi- state cooperative societies and the national cooperative develeopment corporation (amendment) bill, 1995, which will diversify the activities of the corporation and facilitate financing of projects concerning integrated development of agriculture and rural development through cooperatives. how many of these important legislations are eventually passed remains to be seen, given the controversies and disruptions of work that routinely dog both houses routinely.

1,Left to oppose terror law,"new delhi: the left parties have decided to oppose poto, agreeing to coordinate with other opposition parties on the floor of parliament on this issue. in a statement issued following a meeting of the cpi, the cpm, the forward bloc and the rsp, the parties termed the ordinance ``draconian'' and pointed out that the centre had promulgated it without consulting the opposition parties. the manner in which the ordinance was introduced without consultation smacked of an authoritarian bent of mind, it was stated. rather than being an instrument against terrorism, the proposed legislation has the ``potential of being misused against innocent citizens, journalists, opposition activists and minorities as had been experienced during enforcement of tada,'' the statement issued by the cpm said. the left parties will also raise the issue of the government's attempts to communalise the political situation by not taking action against communal organisations like the rss, the vhp and the bajrang dal, the statment said.

2,Jharkhand to amend labour laws,"jamshedpur: the jharkhand government has commissioned the xavier labour relation institute (xlri) here to suggest amendments in the archaic industrial dispute act and the trade union act. the institute is expected to submit its report early next year. in its bid to correct the labour scenario, the government has set up a panel comprising a group of labour officials to evaluate and recommend the changes in the existing labour laws, said the state's labour minister raghuwar das on friday. ``we hope to table the bill on trade union act during the budget session of the state assembly next year,'' he said. the industrial majors, including the state chapter of the confederation of indian industries, have long since been asking for labour sector reforms. the latest step by the government will boost industrial development in the state, it is believed. however, workers' interest would not be compromised, he assured adding, ``our aim is to simplify the rules and make them more effective. the changes ill be in line of gujarat, maharashtra and west bengal.'' the minister further said the government would make the act more stringent to stop mushrooming of unions. the recommendations of the second labour commission on formation of unions will be implemented. according to the new panel suggestions, of at least 10 per cent of the employees will be necessary to form a union in a factory. ``earlier, only seven persons could form a union. we had cases when seven members of a family got together to form a trade union,'' das said. incidentally, the ailing psu heavy engineering corporation at ranchi has 33 unions for 4,500 employees. another psu has one union per nearly 57 employees. ``the larger number of trade unions has not helped the cause of the workers,'' the minister observed. ``besides unhealthy practices, there are other problems also. our intention is to make the trade union more responsible,'' he added. the ministry has already clipped the wings of its inspectors by imposing restrictions on `official inspection'. it has also introduced the single-window system for the i-t companies.

3,Rajnath govt to promulgate POTO if Parliament rejects,"patna: uttar pradesh (up) chief minister rajnath singh on sunday announced that his government would promulgate an ordinance to prevent terrorism in the state if the prevention of terrorism ordinance (poto) is not passed by both the houses of parliament. the up government would issue such an ordinance within three days of parliament rejecting the poto, singh said, while justifying the promulgation of poto. he referred to americans rallying behind their president george w bush on the isssue of combatting terrorism, but was surprised that opposition parties in india had criticised the poto on religious ground saying it could be used to arrest muslims. he was in the town to participate in the `national integration day against terrorism' organised by the patna mahanagar unit of the bjp at sri krishna memorial hall. ""all muslims living in the country are indians, and hence the question of poto being invoked against them does not arise,"" he said, adding: ""all muslims are not traitors, nor all hindus are patriots."" singh said muslims constituted only 15 per cent of the total arrest made under terrorist and disruptive act (tada). this figure would come down to only six per cent if the number of people arrested in kashmir under the act was excluded from the list, he added. the bjp, he said, had supported the congress government move to extend the term of tada, even as a large number of its workers were arrested under the act in gujarat. he described prime minister atal behari vajpayee as a ""statesman respected all over the world"" and said india had emerged undisputed leader of the third world countries during his rule. singh was critical of the opposition parties's stand on vajpayee-government's support to the usa in its attack on afghanistan and said they had also criticised vajpayee in the midst of kargil war. singh, however, criticised the usa for not taking the cross-border terrorism issue seriously till the terrorists' attack on pentagon and world trade center (wtc). later talking to mediapersons, singh said that pakistan's existence would be in jeopardy if it did not stop cross border terrorism in kashmir immediately. he, however, denied that india was planning to annexe pakistan. state bjp chief nand kishore yadav and leader of opposition in the state assembly sushil kumar modi criticised rjd president laloo prasad yadav for his statement that bihar government will not enforce poto in the state. he said that if laloo had his say he would not have enforced even the prevention of corruption act (pca) in bihar. the rjd government had failed to enforce even the ipc and crpc in the state, modi added, pointing to the poor law and order situation. modi said that it was unfortunate that chief minister rabri devi preferred to stay in patna and did not attend the inter-state council meet held in delhi. singh said that 40,000 people had got employmnent in up within two months of implementation of new reservation policy by the state government. he also predicted a huge majority for the bjp in the general elections to the up assembly due early next year.

7,TDP MPs told to nail rail minister,"hyderabad: the winter session of parliament, beginning on monday, will keep the telugu desam party mps busy with the party's parliamentary party deciding to take up several demands of the state pending with the centre. among those on top of the tdpp's agenda are the 'injustice' meted out to the state by the railway ministry which was 'going slow' on several railway lines in andhra pradesh. it was learnt that chief minister n chandrababu naidu stressed on the need for the party mps to take the railway minister to task on this issue. naidu's direction came during a meeting of the tdpp members at ntr bhavan, the party headquarters, on sunday. he (naidu) spoke strongly on this matter, a party source said. the tdp was likely to press for voting when the supplementary railway budget comes up for discussion and passage in a bid to pressurise the ministry to push various projects in the state ahead. meanwhile,tdpp leader k yerrannaidu accompanied by senior party mp c ramachandraiah told reporters that the party would also take up the issue of drought relief for the state during the session. while the mps were expected to follow up on several other issues such as extension of the 'food-for-work' programme till june 2002 and the like, yerrannaidu made it clear that the tdp would have little to do with any debate on the reinduction of samata party leader george fernandes as defence minister as it was an internal affair of the national democratic alliance. he, however, said the tdp would ask the bjp to rein in organisations such as the vhp and prevent recurrence of incidents such as the recent vhp entry into the ayodhya temple. on poto, yerrannaidu said the party's stand was already made clear by the chandrababu naidu at the recent chief ministers' conference on internal security. declaring that his party would support the poto bill, he, however, said the party would seek a three-year sunset provision for the bill.

10,Ordinance on terrorism protested,"guntur: former minister and senior congress leader mohammad jani on sunday said the prevention of terrorism ordinance poto) tramples upon human rights and constitutional guarantees of freedom. speaking at a seminar on sunday organised by lok satta, he said though former prime ministers indira gandhi and rajiv gandhi were victims of terrorism, it did not mean that a repressive order such as poto should be supported. poto confers arbitrary powers on the police and curtails freedom of the press, he added. bjp leader j rangaraju contended that existing laws were inadequate to check the growing menace of terrorism and said poto was a replica of the control of organised crime act, 1999 passed in maharashtra by the congress government there. he also said that there were safeguards like review by a high court judge, to prevent abuse of the law. human rights activist b chandra sekhar feared that poto helps the government unleash a reign of terror instead of controlling terrorism. he cited several instances of abuse of tada.

11,Country needs tough law like POTO: Joshi,"pune: using the fluid situation in the sub-continent to justify stricter laws against terrorism, union minister for human resource development murli manohar joshi has said the government is ready to make amendments to the proposed prevention of terrorism ordinance (poto) provided the opposition parties make constructive suggestions during the winter session of the parliament. addressing a press conference here on sunday, mr joshi said the hostile environment in neighbouring countries in the recent past has necessitated introduction of laws which could deal firmly with all types of terrorism.with the taliban losing ground in afghanistan, the rulers in pakistan would now try to focus on kashmir by making it an international issue, he said. any attempt to intensify or destabilise the internal security of kashmir can be checked using provisions of poto, he added. launching a frontal attack on parties opposing introduction of poto, mr joshi took a dig at the congress for accusing the bjp of misusing the new ordinance against political opponents. the congress should not take the moral high ground on this count as it has already used terrorism and disruptive activities (tada) in the past to nail leaders of the bjp, said mr joshi.the unabashed manner in which the congress exploited tada to persecute bjp leaders in gujarat is a classic example, he added. mr joshi said the congress is creating a negative atmosphere by drumming up a frenzy against poto. in reality, even the provisions of the indian penal code ipc) and the criminal procedure code (cr pc) are misused on several occasions knowingly or inadvertently. but this should not be used as a logic to stall introduction of new laws, he argued. the congress should come up with constructive suggestions rather than creating a nuisance just for the heck of it, he added. to a query, mr joshi acknowledged that his government was not in a position to get poto passed in the rajya sabha due to lack of numbers. nevertheless, the government would make every effort to convince the members of the upper house about the exigency of having poto as a law. but the country will not forgive mps who vote against poto as it will weaken the democratic system, he remarked. rallying around the provisions of the contentious ordinance, mr joshi said the centre should not be blamed for contriving draconian rules under poto as the draft had been conceived by the law commission. moreover, the ordinance has been approved by the national human rights commission (nhrc), he said. mr joshi said some of the states had already put in place new laws to replace tada much before the centre introduced poto. in a subtle jibe at the maharashtra government, he said it was strange to see that certain chief ministers were opposing the provisions of poto although they had similar laws in existence at the state level. the state already has the maharashtra control of organised crime act (mcoca).

21,NDA wants safeguards in terror law,"new delhi: after the chief ministers, it was the turn of nda partners on monday to make the government beat yet another retreat on the prevention of terrorism ordinance. it asked the government to take all ""necessary steps"" to remove any apprehensions that poto ""can be misused against the press, political opponents and any specific community"". this, after law minister arun jaitley told nda members that their apprehensions were ""misplaced"" and the law already had enough safeguards in it.simultaneously, the all-party meeting, earlier planned for tuesday, has been postponed till after the home ministry's parliamentary consultative committee ^ on which mps of all parties are represented ^ meets on wednesday. highly placed nda sources said the pm has virtually put the ball back into home minister advani's court, seeking that his ministry's consultative committee first hammer out an agreement before an all-party meeting is held.nda convenor george fernandes, briefing the press on the nda meeting, was hard pressed to explain why the consensus-building had not preceded the promulgation of the ordinance. ""the law is concerned with an extraordinary situation, not with individuals. the government acts. the government has acted."" then why the discussions at all? ""we are democratic and believe in consulting everyone.""from the day's developments it appeared that the battle within the nda between the ""hardliners"", as one bjp leader put it, and the moderates within the nda as well as the bjp, was well and truly joined. those in the advani camp have begun to speak of a joint session of parliament to benefit from a majority of a few votes to push poto through. the government cannot muster the numbers in the rajya sabha. only twice in the past joint session of the two houses was held: once in 1961 to pass the dowry prohibition bill, and in 1978 to push through the banking services commission repeal bill.but those close to the pm are far more cautious. their line is that having a joint session merely to ""humiliate"" the opposition will not serve any purpose, unless they are sure the national mood is in perfect sync with poto in its present form.at monday's nda meeting, those who expressed reservations about the bill included commerce minister murasoli maran (dmk), who pointed out how the maintenance of internal security act (misa) had been used against him. the national conference's shariefuddin sharif and the indian national lok dal's sushil indora also expressed their reservations about the bill in its present form. mention of tada was also made in this context. interestingly, of the nda's partners which have problems with the bill, the akali dal and the trinamul congress were not present because of prior engagements.

22,NBA may move court against govt on loan,"bhopal: the narmada bachao andolan (nba) has threatened to drag the madhya pradesh government to the supreme court if the latter decided to convert the loan advanced to the narmada valley development authority (nvda) or the state electricity board into equity in companies like sri maheshwar hydel power corporation promoted by the s kumar's group.legal notices in this connection have already been served to the chief secretary, energy secretary, the mpeb chairman and its member (finance).talking to newspersons in bhopal sunday, nba representatives alok agarwal and chitaroopa palit said the comptroller and auditor general (cag) report, tabled in the assembly recently, had made it clear that a sum of about rs 86 crore, which the state government ought to have realised from the sale of the maheshwar and pench projects in 1992 and 1994, was still pending. the report also stated that the loan given by the madhya pradesh state industrial development corporation to indus enertek limited (formerly s kumar's power corporation limited) was more than rs 3 crore which far exceeded the corporation's permissible limit. this loan was provided without the necessary permission from the state government.the spokespersons said the mpsidc had recently issued a public notice in a leading financial daily regarding non-refund of loans amounting to rs 11.8 crore by the s kumar's group of companies with a specific intention. several letters and notices had been issued but no reply, let alone the payment, had been received. the public notice declared that the corporation had now decided to take legal action against the companies concerned and that their guarantors may do the same, seeking their closure.the nba cited this in support of its well-known stand that the maheshwar project would turn out to be a millstone around the government's neck (much like enron) since it would have to shell out rs 600 crore to s kumar's for 35 years according to the agreement. ``this will destroy the state economy,'' the nba said. more than 50,000 poor farmers, labourers, fishermen and others will be badly affected by the project.the nba activists said s kumar's also owed several crores to both the nvda and the mpseb. the cag report specifically said that s kumar's had still to return rs 10.47 crore to the former. it was surprising that the company also owed rs 255 crore to financial institutions and commercial banks. the company has also not paid amount due in form of rent for use of its property.according to reports, rs 106.40 crore had been transferred to other group companies which were not given any contract in the maheshwar project. the nba demanded that these financial dealings be inquired into and the erring officials taken to task.
