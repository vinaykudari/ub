0,76 file nominations for civic polls,"mumbai: the nominations for the february 2002 civic polls have finally begun to trickle in with the official tally standing at 76 aspirants on monday. however, with the major political parties still to announce their list of nominees, most of the nomination papers filed so far have been by independent candidates.``on monday, we received 42 nominations, of which 32 aspirants are independent candidates,'' bmc election officer n.b. mundle said. the other aspirants who filed their papers on monday include one from the congress, four from the akhil bharatiya sena of arun gawli, two from the bahujan samaj party and one each from the janata dal, rashtriya janata dal and rashtriya lok dal.meanwhile, the bharatiya janata party (bjp) released its list of 60 candidates on monday. as part of the sena-bjp tie-up, the bjp is fielding candidates for 70 of the total 227 seats. the remaining names will be announced late.both the shiv sena and the congress are likely to declare their list of candidates on tuesday. sena big-wigs were closeted in high-powered meetings for the entire day on monday trying to finalise the names of 156 candidates from among 1,000 aspirants. commenting on the recent defection of former party mla gurunath desai and chief of gujarat sena raju rawal to the nationalist congress party (ncp), sena spokesperson subhash desai said, ``their exit is not going to affect the party's chances in the civic elections.'' he ruled out the possibility of further defections.the congress, on the other hand, claims to have received over 2,000 applications. ``it's been a tough task narrowing down the list to 227 candidates,'' said mumbai regional congress committee president murli deora.the ncp, which seems to be in a jubilant mood after welcoming the two sena leaders into its ranks, is still trying to work out a coalition with the republican party of india's athavale and kawade factions and janata dal (secular). ``our list of nominees is expected to be ready by wednesday,'' party spokesperson gurunath kulkarni said.the samajwadi party has ruled out the possibility of an alliance with the congress and decided to contest the civic polls on its own. holding the ``high-handedness'' on the part of congress representatives responsible for the failure of talks, party spokesperson majeed memon said, ``we waited till the last moment for the congress to come out with a respectable and reasonable arrangement. but the congress does not seem to be interested in preventing the division of secular votes. the sp can not be blamed if communal forces gain out of this.'' the sp released its first list of 49 candidates on sunday. ``the remaining names will be announced on tuesday,'' memon added.mumbai lokshahi aghadi, comprising, among others, the samata party, dmk, lok janshakti party, janata dal (united), dalit sena, hind mazdoor kisan panchayat and juggi zopadi sangh, released its first list 57 candidates on sunday.

1,BMC polls will be litmus test for Uddhav,"mumbai: the february 10 elections to the brihanmumbai municipal corporation (bmc) will be a political test for shiv sena leader uddhav thackeray. this is the first major challenge he is facing since he occupied the number two slot in the party - next only to his father bal thackeray - two years ago.with the senior thackeray, whose 75th birthday will be celebrated later this month, effectively letting the low-profile uddhav, who has remained untouched by any controversy, handle the crucial polls, the young leader is busy preparing for the task ahead. he has a core team, which includes former mla subhash desai, to guide him and to help him scrutinise hundreds of applications for party tickets.in the past two years, uddhav has concentrated on building the party organisation and knows most of the party activists by their first names. all the `vibhag pramukhs' or district chiefs are fiercely loyal to him, and they have been assigned the crucial role of vetting applications for tickets. this has naturally vested `vibhag pramukhs' with an enormous clout. in the past, senior party leaders used to lobby for their favourite candidates. as this method had the tendency of creating groupism in the party, the party machinery is being given primary importance.``the proximity of a ticket aspirant to any of the senior leaders of the party is not the criterion for his selection. uddhav saheb is strictly going by the track record of the applicant, elective merit and the views of the `vibhag pramukh','' a senior sena leader observed.the division of anti-sena votes between the congress and the nationalist congress party (ncp) has made uddhav's task relatively easy. until a few days ago, it appeared that the anti-incumbency feeling in the city would sweep out of office the sena-bharatiya janata party alliance, which has been ruling the bmc for the last five years. but the firm refusal of the congress to contest the polls in tandem with the ncp has ensured a division of the anti-saffron votes in most of the 227 constituencies.the dalit votes are likely to be split among different factions of the republican party of india and the muslim votes are likely to be distributed among the congress, the ncp and the samajwadi party. the situation has become more favourable to the sena because factionalism has raised its head with a vengeance in the congress.however, political observers say that the division of the anti-saffron votes may not automatically translate into a large number of seats for the sena-bjp combine. the sena will have to contend with disgruntlement within its own ranks. the defection of prominent sena activist gurunath desai on sunday to the ncp could be the proverbial tip of the iceberg. the sena is also being challenged in its stronghold of parel-lalbaug by arun gawli's akhil bharatiya sena. sena circles allege that the abs is being encouraged by the ncp to terrorise sainiks in the saffron heartland.the sena also has to deal with the poaching expeditions launched by deputy chief minister and senior ncp leader chhagan bhujbal, who is a former sainik himself and understands the organisation like the back of his palm. he is in constant touch with lower-level functionaries of the sena and is waiting to exploit dissension in the party, which is likely to come to the surface once the list of candidates is announced by the sena leadership. the sena will also be handicapped by the fact that bal thackeray will not be in a position to extensively campaign for its candidates because of severe security constraints in the post-12/13 situation.

3,SP corporator shot at; traders protest attack,"lucknow: samajwadi party (sp) corporator of the cantonment board was shot at by unidentified assailants on monday afternoon. the vice-president of the board, who was with him, also suffered pellet injuries. as a mark of protest, traders downed their shutters in sadar area after the incident. political rivalry was stated to be the reason behind the attack. the incident took place around 1 pm when the corporator, ram chander yadav (50) and the vice-president, mohd yusuf (60), were on their way home on a scooter. ram chander was suffering from knee pain and was undergoing treatment by a vaidya putting up at natraj hotel in the old city, mohd yusuf said while talking to mediapersons soon after the incident. we were on a scooter and had reached near shiv narayan petrol pump when two youths riding a motorcycle intercepted us, mohd yusuf said. the miscreants asked ram chander, who was driving the scooter, to stop. even as ram chander tried to slow down the scooter, one of the assailants opened fire from a close range. the bullet hit yadav on his neck and shoulders while mohd yusuf, who was riding the pillion, also suffered pellet injuries on his face and hand. though the relatives of the victims remained tight-lipped over the probable reason behind the attack, police claimed that the incident was a fallout of old political enmity. two local youths, sanjay yadav and shitij, have been named as accused in the fir. sanjay had earlier contested for corporator's seat but lost, and was reportedly a rival of ram chander. immediately after the news about the incident reached the sadar market, traders downed their shutters to protest against the attack and the market remained closed thereafter. many senior officials of the army also visited ram chander at the kgmc where he is undergoing treatment. his condition was stated to be stable.

13,Congmen rally for relatives,"new delhi: the congress leadership is worried that the raging infighting in the punjab unit may derail the party's prospects in the state, but the dissidents are refusing to budge. congress leaders admitted on tuesday that with the finalisation of the list of candidates for the forthcoming assembly elections in the state taking far more time than it should, arch-rival and ruling party akali dal may have already got a head start in punjab. the akali dal, an ally of the bharatiya janata party, is part of the ruling nda alliance at the centre. ""the akalis have already started campaigning extensively in the state. all our punjab leaders are still here fighting over ticket. this infighting could hurt us,"" said a senior congress leader. warring punjab leaders have pitched camp at the congress headquarters here since last week, squabbling over the grant of ticket to their nominees. this has delayed the process of scrutiny of lists. chief minister and akali dal leader parkash singh badal is making news in punjab for addressing election rallies in a specially built vehicle after a debilitating injury. what worries the congress leadership is that the infighting may scuttle its comeback bid. the party hopes to form government in the state, but mps, up in arms against the pradesh congress committee president capt. amrinder singh, have warned that this would not be possible without their support. dissident leader and mp jagmeet singh brar said, ""we have a good chance but, for that, amrinder singh would have to show grace and meet workers in the state rather than try and push his nominees."" the battle is over grant of ticket to relatives, which both sides accuse the other of doing. several mps, led by brar, met motilal vora, aicc general secretary in charge of punjab, on monday to plead against 'irregularities in lists' proposed by amrinder singh. brar said vora had promised a review of the lists. ""we have been promised a review before the list is finalised in a day or two,"" he said. denying that they are only fighting for grant of ticket to their relatives, the mps allege that the pcc chief has ignored prominent congress leaders, instead backing the candidature of ""relatives, friends and industrialists"". brar said the mps were also individually meeting party chief sonia gandhi, who had lent them a sympathetic ear. on sunday, the mps had written to sonia threatening to boycott the campaign for the elections and warning that their absence would spoil the party's chances. on the congress' strict guidelines on ""ticket for kith and kin of senior party leaders"", brar pointed out that amrinder singh's wife preneet kaur was also an mp.

21,Mission joins govt in saving nature,"siliguri: ramakrishna mission is now getting involved in maintaining the country's biodiversity. as the nodal agency in west bengal for developing a national biodiversity strategy and action plan for the union ministry of environment and forest, the mission is going down to villages to involve all in biodiversity conservation. in a recent seminar at siliguri, they identified the main threats to north bengal's forest — the 'lung of west bengal' — and its biodiversity. the mission will take the responsibility of organising people, schools, colleges and ngos in the biodiversity strategy with help from the department of environment. about 40 delegates from ngos of north bengal and top forest officials attended the seminar. india has an enormous amount of diversity in its life forms and eco-systems. it ensures essential ecological functions, steady supply of water, oxygen and food for all. now this biodiversity is seriously threatened by human activities, leading to shortage of water, food, fodder, fuel and causing natural disasters. immediate arrest of this depredation is of utmost importance, feels union joint secretary (environment and forests) r.h. khawas. he is the co-ordinator for the countrywide campaign, to be prepared by 2002. only long-term planning can save the rich forest land of north bengal, said s. das of r.k. mission. he said that consultation sessions were being organised in rural and forest fringe areas to get the maximum amount of feedback from locals. this is being compiled at state level and then at national level. the ministry will prepare its final strategy on the basis of this feedback. in addition to the illegal felling of trees and indiscriminate usage of pesticides in tea gardens and agricultural fields, the main threats to north bengal, as discussed in the seminar, are an excessive increase in the number of 'ban bustees (forest settlements)' and human activities within the forest, said das. encroachment and filling up of wetlands for urbanisation in north bengal is another danger. the forum identified a few other major threats, such as huge extraction of dolomite from bhutan hills, causing streaming of debris into north bengal rivers. all these troubles are compounded by an inert pollution control department in north bengal. as a result, wildlife like the red panda, the himalayan black bear, elephants and tiger have been suffering greatly. now, one of the major threats here is poaching by militants active in north bengal to make easy money, said u. dasgupta, chief conservator of forests (wildlife).

""the girl belonging to a landless family was kidnapped from a field by powerful elements of khambala village,"" solanki said. ""she was kept in captivity for 15 days. despite the fact that four persons were arrested, they were set free even before they could be produced before the court. i fail to understand how police inspector zala, investigating the matter, is treating a poor family like this."" ""the girl was taken to the botad civil hospital, the nearest to barwala, where i met her. she told me what had happened. her condition is pitiable. the doctors confirmed she was raped. she even identified the victims before the police, yet they did not act. ""now, zadaphia says he will inquire into the whole incident. the answer is unacceptable. i will not tolerate this. what is there to inquire when the whole case is crystal clear,"" he asked, threatening a full-scale campaign against the government if he is not heard. ""i will take the matter to the chief minister on wednesday. i'm not going to sit quiet. i'll wait for an action for three days before starting a campaign. it is not a question of a girl belonging to my community being attacked. it is a question of justice, whichever community one belongs to,"" solanki added.

24,"BJP, Congress to oppose Bangla bandh","kolkata: the west bengal unit of the bharatiya janata party has opposed the bangla bandh called by suci and a few other left parties on january 10. state bjp president asim ghosh appealed to suci and other sponsors of thursday's bandh to desist from doing so. ghosh explained that his party was opposed to the bandh for two reasons. the country is passing through a critical state as a situation of undeclared war is prevailing. it is our duty to lend a helping hand to the government. the courts have declared bandh to be illegal, ghosh said. ghosh said that the bandh call could not be supported because the state economy was in disarray. the bandh will hit the state exchequer badly and boost unemplyment. the daily labourers will be hit hard. the politics of bandh must stop, ghosh said. but the bjp state president hastened to add that it was the left front government who had done immense harm to the state by sponsoring bandhs, both as opposition and as the ruling party. the left front seems to have realised the futility of bandh politics at last, ghosh observed. the bjp president said that a mere increase in service charges in hospitals and fees in colleges, as has been done by the state government, will not improve the quality of service. irresponsible trade unionism in hospitals must stop, ghosh said. state bjp's opposition to bangla bandh has given rise to a paradoxical situation in state politics. with the trinamul lending support to the january 10 bangla bandh, nda allies are clearly divided on the issue. in fact, the bjp is closer to cpm on the bandh issue. ghosh, however, sees nothing wrong in this. trinamul is a separate political party. they can have differing perception on this issue, he said. cong opposition the west bengal pradesh congress is opposed to disruptions and bandhs if these are organised by political parties without giving adequate notice. it is okay if sufficient time is given before a bandh is organised, said pcc president pranab mukherjee in kolkata on tuesday. reacting to the bangla bandh , mukherjee said that the issues were genuine. mukherjee also announced his party's month-long programme in the districts. it is clear that the pradesh congress is putting its act together for the panchayat elections in the state. we are aware that our organisation is not that strong. but we want to put up candidates in all the panchayat seats, mukherjee said. as a part of its strategy to revitalise the rural organisation, senior pradesh leaders will hit the districts from january 12, covering burdwan, murshidabad, malda, howrah and hooghly districts in the first phase.
