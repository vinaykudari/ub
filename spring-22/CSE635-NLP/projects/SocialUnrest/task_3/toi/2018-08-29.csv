2,1st anniversary of anti-power hike rally,"hyderabad: processions, rallies and condolence meetings by the congress and the left parties marked the first anniversary of the protest rally against power tariff hike in which three people lost their lives on this day last year in the city. the three-month long agitation culminated in a bloody scene at bashirbagh on august 28 last year when a major clash between the rallyists and the police resulted in police firing in which three were killed and many were injured. the opposition parties had organised a 'chalo assembly' procession which suddenly turned violent. the police beat up the crowd first but resorted to firing when they were unable to control the mob. the leaders and activists of the congress and the left parties paid floral tributes to balaswamy, ramakrishna and vishnuvardhan reddy who died in the police firing. the congress leaders held a meeting at the babu jagjivan ram statue near l b stadium while the left parties organised a silent march from basheerbagh to gun foundry to mark the occasion. addressing the congress leaders and activists, andhra pradesh congress committee (apcc) president m satyanarayana rao said the sacrifices made by the three youth did not go waste. people had expressed solidarity with them in the form of ballot in the recent elections to the local bodies. ""chief minister n chandrababu naidu should respect the people's mandate and change his policies,"" he said. he said this was not just an opposition demand. even naidu's own legislators were seeking the changes, he added. senior congress leaders k rosaiah, g venkataswamy, p sudhakar reddy and others participated in the meeting. leaders of the nine left parties -- including the cpi, cpm, cpi (ml-nd), mcpi and cpi (mljanasakhti) -- reiterated that they would continue their struggle against the world bank-dictated anti-people reforms being pursued by the naidu government in the state. they demanded that the government immediately withdraw the cases filed against 22 left leaders as well as scores of activists during the agitation.

3,City Christians welcome bill to reform divorce law,"pune: clergy and lay christians in pune have welcomed the landmark government bill to reform the 132-year-old christian divorce law, which was prejudiced in favour of men. the new divorce bill, which was approved by the rajya sabha on monday, not only gives the same rights to men and women for annulment of marriage, but also widens the grounds for doing so. importantly, the reforming bill lifts the ceiling on alimony, which was fixed at one-fifth of the husband's income, and allows divorce by mutual consent after a two-year mandatory wait. the clergy is usually slow to accept reform in personal laws, citing age-old religious sanction. but valerian d'souza, bishop of pune, hails the reform as a respite for christian women. ""the bill has been stalled several times in the past, and many women facing physical or mental problems in their marriages have had to continue a life of inconvenience,"" he said, and went on to add that the lawmakers should have realised the redundancy of the divorce law framed in the last century much earlier. he also approved of the lifting of the ceiling on alimony as it would help assist divorced women with no other means of support. father cruise d'souza, former member of the catholic marriage tribunal, points out that the reforms are in keeping with the recommendations made by several organisations. ""many high courts in the country too have passed judgements which, in effect, had amended the old, archaic divorce law.the government has just incorporated the changes suggested and passed by the higher courts in the latest bill,"" he said. it was the ""unreasonableness"" of the old law that made the new one necessary, said sister teresa of the congregation of maria assunta, and a lawyer by profession. the archaic law made divorce a very difficult matter because the woman had to prove the charge of adultery, along with cruelty and desertion, to win the case. a woman had to produce eye-witnesses or photographs to prove the adultery of her husband, which was often impossible. ""it was a daunting task for a woman to prove charges like incest, impotency and desertion and so she had to continue to suffer,"" sister teresa added. catholic couples should register their marriage with the registrar's office following the sacred ceremony in church, sister teresa advised, so that divorce can then be sought under the special marriage act, 1956, which is applicable to any religion. lawyer a. j. castellino also pointed out that the old divorce act made it impossible for the wife to get a divorce because she had to prove multiple charges against her husband. ""a woman had to prove that her husband had committed bigamy with adultery, incestuous adultery or adultery aggravated by bestiality to get a decision in her favour. in contrast, the husband just had to prove that his wife was unfaithful and indulged in adultery,"" he said. moreover, even if a woman got a judgement in her favour in the district court, she had to appear before a special bench of the high court which had to confirm the decree. ""the new bill may change this disadvantage for the petitioner woman,"" he adds.

5,‘Legal action not possible for impromptu bandhs’,"mumbai: the various court rulings banning a bandh do not cover the kind of 'spontaneous' bandh, such as the one that took place in thane on monday, according to many in the legal fraternity. the bandh, which followed the death of shiv sena leader anand dighe had paralysed all public services in thane. notwithstanding the damage caused by sena activists, it would be difficult to haul them up for contempt of court, they say, pointing out it would be difficult to equate a ""spontaneous expression of grief"" to a well-planned bandh proclaimed by political parties. a 1998 supreme court judgment had upheld the kerela high court verdict declaring bandhs proclaimed by political parties and trade unions as ""illegal and unconstitutional'' and directing state governments to recoup the losses from the groups calling the bandh. recently, the bombay high court had asked the maharashtra government to ensure the apex court order was implemented in the state. however, ""in this particular case, no one called for a bandh. if it was done, then it was carried out surreptitiously,'' said former mumbai police commissioner julio ribeiro, who was part of the group which had filed a public interest litigation in the bombay hc, seeking a declaration that calling for bandhs is illegal. the ruling would apply only if a bandh had been declared in advance, senior counsel p.r. vakil told this newspaper. ""if something happens impromptu, then there is no remedy. it is something that you have to suffer in a democracy,'' he added. consumer activist shirish deshpande, while concurring with the point that the bandh was not pre- planned, added that it could not, however, be justified in any way. ""even if it is a very beloved leader, there can be a peaceful hartal to express their grief. that is something i can understand,'' he said. mr deshpande pointed out there had been considerable economic losses with industrial units in the whole of thane district having to remain shut.""the time has come to reconsider expressions of regret, and i am sure there are better and more acceptable ways of showing respect to the departed,'' he said. in fact, even if monday's bandh did not fall under the ambit of the sc judgement, the shiv sainiks should compensate for the losses suffered due to their activities, he added. activists also state that police should have been far more vigilant and acted immediately, in the face of rampage by sena activists. ""the police and the government should take action in such cases,'' said mr ribeiro. he also felt that the police should have acted more firmly. ""the police should have shown that they would not have tolerated any rampage, but they did not,'' he added. even if court judgements could not be invoked about monday's bandh, social activist gerson d'cunha felt that other laws could be made applicable in this case. ""there is a different law for what is fair and just, and that should be applied here,'' he added.

7,Sena will assign duties to party activists in Thane,"mumbai: in the absence of a new chief, shiv sena's thane district unit plans to emulate mr anand dighe's 'mantra' while conducting the party's organisational matters. mr dighe died following a cardiac arrest at sunitidevi singhania hospital in thane on sunday. ""mr dighe would assign each organisational duty to a separate group of party activists and subsequently ask for progress report. now that he is no more, the sena will follow the principle of division of labour,'' sena mp from thane prakash paranjpe told this newspaper on tuesday. ""there were ugly incidents in the early hours of sunday following the news of mr dighe's death. however, the largely-attended funeral on monday was peaceful and well-organised as we put into practice the principle of division of labour. groups of sena workers were assigned separate jobs and we all worked in close coperation,'' mr paranjpe said. asked about the choice of mr dighe's successor, mr paranjpe said the final decision would be taken by sena chief bal thackeray. ""the sena activists are still in a state of shock. it's difficult to believe that mr dighe is no more. the announcement of a new district unit chief will take some time,'' he added. an all-party condolence public meeting will be held in thane on wednesday which will be attended by key sena leaders, including uddhav thackeray, raj thackeray and former chief minister narayan rane. however, the sena has not given a call for 'bandh', mr paranjpe pointed out. ""all kinds of rumours are flying in the air. our opponents are out to malign the sena. there will be no 'bandh' in any part of the state on wednesday,"" the sena mp said.

8,'The slum rehabilitation scheme was flawed from day one',"mumbai: the problem of housing has assumed alarming proportions in mumbai. while on the one hand slums are rapidly proliferating, on the other old buildings are being pulled down by builders to put up skyscrapers. more than half the population of the city is living in slums, while the middle class is struggling to find a decent roof over its head. the state government asked housing expert, social activist and architect chandrashekar prabhu to study the housing problem and make recommendations to solve it. mr prabhu has already submitted 11 volumes of his preliminary report. the times of india spoke to him on this issue. excerpts: what is your observation as a housing expert regarding redevelopment schemes for slums and old and dilapidated buildings of mumbai? any scheme which is based on different variables for its success is bound to fail. the tinaikar committee report on the functioning of the shivshahi punarvasan prakalp limited (sppl) has gone deeply into the problems of slums and given recommendations which the government must immediately accept and implement. the scheme for old and dilapidated buildings which gave unlimited fsi to builders has resulted in dishousing those very tenants for whom it was ostensibly meant. i have visited several buildings where on record reconstruction has been undertaken and old tenants have been shown as rehabilitated. however, the old tenants are not there at all. in one case at gowalia tank, out of the 19 old tenants, none have been rehabilitated. in another building in nana chowk we found that only four of the 31 tenants have been rehabilitated. the story goes on and on. those for whose benefit the scheme was framed seem to have been dishoused. the net result is that the builders have benefited and tenants have been thrown out. the tinaikar committee report on sppl has observed that irregularities were committed while disbursing loans to builders and that the company should be wound up. what is your opinion on it? mr tinaikar is known to call a spade a spade. if irregularities have been detected then those involved must be punished, however big or strong they may be. the government must show the political will to act without fear or favour as the people of the state expect this government to do so. what do you have to say about the government's slum rehabilitation scheme? the entire exercise was flawed from the very first day. the formation of the afzulpurkar committee in 1995 itself was faulty as it comprised builders and only one ngo representative was there. no slumdweller was involved in the decision-making. the report only resulted in the promotion of mr afzulpurkar as state chief secretary. when the stakes for giving a report are so high, naturally the effort will be to appease those in power and not go by the merits of the matter. this was the beginning of the tragic circumstances into which the slumdwellers have been pushed today. it is indeed a paradox that some of those who were members of the afzulpurkar committee benefited by the very scheme that they recommended to the government. then came the formation of the slum redevelopment authority (sra). the sra was constituted to be a planning authority, which would approve proposals for slum redevelopment. amongst the members of the sra were some professionals who later got themselves appointed as project management consultants on projects approved by the sra. some of them have benefited to the tune of crores of rupees without putting in much effort. this is a patent clash of interest. when the approver of the proposal himself becomes a beneficiary, then the malafides are well established. you have submitted your report on the state housing policy to the government. can you tell us about the important features of this report? a) i have submitted 11 volumes of my preliminary report as early as july 2000. in the preliminary report and letters accompanying them, i have asked for several details and data regarding most of the housing schemes. i have dealt in detail with the slum improvement schemes, functioning of various housing organisations like mhada, repairs of old and dilapidated buildings, reconstruction by mhada, reconstruction by private developers, slum redevelopment, housing the economic weaker sections and the overall policy for the state on housing and urban development. i have also pointed out severe deficiencies and lapses on the part of the government in the implementation of the various schemes. has the government taken any cognisance of your report? the official reaction from the government is that the report is being ""processed"". i do not know how long this will take. once i get the data required then i can proceed and make my interim recommendations which could be implemented immediately and submit my final report which will comprise of short term and long term schemes and projects.

9,Lifeline for govt in Yeleru scam,"hyderabad: justice b k somasekhara, who headed the commission of inquiry that probed the yeleru land scam, has provided an escape route to the government, which is under pressure from the opposition to revive it. even before the government issued formal orders on august 4 winding up the commission, somasekhara had already relinquished office on july 31, 1999. this was nearly a month after the state high court struck down the go constituting the commission. the official correspondence indicates that the somasekhara commission was wound up on july 31, 1999 for all practical purposes, the day somasekhara resigned. immediately after the high court judgment, g yethirajulu, secretary to the commission, in a letter to the revenue secretary dated june 24, 1999, stated that the records procured and evidence collected by the commission should be indexed and said, this may take time till july 31, 1999.'' he requested the government to depute responsible officers to take possession of the records and furniture. consequent to this letter, the government issued a go dated july 14, 1999, according permission to continue the office establishment of the commission and other facilities up to july 31, 1999. the government has issued two separate orders on august 19, 1999, allotting a room for storing the records of the commission and deputing nine employees to take possession of the records. g sudhir, revenue secretary, while issuing one of the orders clearly stated that the commission was wound up. three days before stepping down, the justice wrote to sudhir saying that he would be moving to bangalore and thanked the government for all the cooperation.

10,Cadila Bridge incident figures at AMC meet,"ahmedabad: the monthly general board meeting of amc witnessed a shouting match of sorts between the saffron brigade and congress men when congress corporator from dariapur, hasan lala raised the cadila bridge issue. lala accused break down of law and order in ahmedabad and said that prompt action should be taken to arrest anti-socials who are terrorising the economically deprived masses. leader of the opposition at amc, dharmendra shah, immediately retaliated with counter allegations with ""loud"" support from some other party members. the issue threatened to bring down the house when mayor himmatsinh patel stepped in and called for the topic to be struck from general board's agenda. lala then trained his guns on the state government's apparent dilly-dallying tactics on coming out with a clear-cut policy for rebuilding collapsed houses. the dariapur corporator said: ""more than 1,500 middle-class families are the hardest hit because the corporation is not able to pass their building plans as the state government is not clear on its building by-laws."" once again a shouting match ensued and only quelled when the mayor called for decorum in the house. patel then called deputy municipal commissioner, vinay vyasa, who was deputising for the municipal commissioner at the board to reply on the issue. vyasa told the house that of the 17 plans submitted for collapsed buildings 11 have been passed. we have written to the state government for clarification on whether the building plans submitted to the corporation (sans the wilful deviations like extra balcony cover or even illegal storeys) be okayed or should the consequent changes be incorporated. the government is working on this issue and will soon issue a reply.

12,Ruling party MLA advises citizens to stop tax payment,"muzaffarpur: rashtriya janata dal mla from muzaffarpur vijendra chaudhary has called upon the residents of the town to stop paying holding tax to the municipal corporation in protest against the 50 per cent hike in tax, fresh measurement of holdings as also against the week-long strike by the municipal employees. talking to news persons here on monday, chaudhary appealed to the citizens to disallow the measurement of their houses by the municipal employees as, he alleged, the municipal employees entrusted with the work of holding measurement were blackmailing the house owners. the mla said the municipal corporation election is expected to be held shortly -- latest by march next. ""let the measurement be done by elected public representatives,"" he said. moreover, so long the corporation fails to improve sanitation and water supply position, it does not have the moral right to increase the valuation of holdings, he said and added that he would hold public meetings in the town from tuesday onwards to mobilise the public against the tax hike. when contacted, municipal corporation administrator told the times of india that the urban development department had increased the valuation of holdings of muzaffarpur town by 50 per cent two years back. the file was pending in the patna secretariat since then. now, the government has asked the corporation to go ahead with fresh measurement of buildings and increase the tax. the administrator said the fresh measurement would ""correct the mistakes of the 1994 measurement."" meanwhile, the striking municipal employees met district magistrate brajesh mehrotra on monday. the dm advised them to call off the seven-day-long strike as the action against the police officer who had assaulted a municipal employee had been initiated.

13,BJP MP attacks Marandi govt,"ranchi: bjp mp from ranchi ram tahal choudhary has criticised chief minister babulal marandi government's style of functioning. ""the party workers are drifting away from the government, which would adversely affect the party's fortunes,"" choudhary said and added that the bjp's top leaders, including prime minister atal bihari vajpayee and home minister lal krishna advani had been apprised of the situation. defending his attack on his party's state government, choudhary said he was doing so in the interest of the party so that things could improve before it is too late. ""if things do not improve, we may ask for a change in the state leadership,"" he said while addressing a press conference here. the mp rued marandi is so busy, god knows doing what, that he does not have time even to acknowledge letters from mps like choudhary himself and bjp state president prof dukha bhagat. the mlas have to wait for two to three hours to see him. choudhary also criticised the chief minister's decision to meet the mps in delhi which led to expenditure of lakhs on the bureaucrats who went there for this meeting. the marandi government has failed to rein in the bureaucrats, who are openly ignoring their respective ministers' orders; and this has made many ministers unhappy, choudhary said. the bjp-led jharkhand government is busy providing luxuries to its ministers when the need of the hour is to devote time to development and provide clean governance, as was promised at the time of elections, he said. choudhary said, ""six or seven senior bjp workers from ramgarh, marandi's constituency, had come to ranchi to see marandi for some roads and bridges, which were promised to them during the by-election campaign by us."" but they could not see the chief minister, he said. he even alleged that the rate of cut-money has gone up from 20 per cent to 42 per cent, and things are getting from bad to worse. so much so that there is a growing feeling that the creation of jharkhand has become a curse, he added. shortly after choudhary left for delhi, a senior bjp mahila morcha leader was heard saying the mahila morcha too would ask for a change in the leadership if things do not improve soon.

16,No anti-incumbency factor: BJP,"shimla: the bjp is confident that there is no anti-incumbency factor in the state, despite the government having been in power for the past three-and-a-half years. the legislature party, which deliberated for two days, felt that the congress had not been able to launch a broadside against it. party spokesman ganesh dutt said that the legislators present at the meeting expressed confidence that despite heading an alliance government, chief minister prem kumar dhumal had given precious little to the congress to make an issue off. he said that the recently concluded four-day monsoon session of the vidhan sabha was a pointer to this. ""with two former chief ministers, two former speakers and almost all other mlas having held the rank of ministers in the opposition benches, the performance given by the congress party, when it not only failed to pin down the government but even raise issues that would be a subject of discussion outside, was rather dismal"", he added. dutt said that on the third day of the session, which was a privatemember day, former minister asha kumari was forced to take back her resolution and the resolution brought by the hpcc chief,vidya stokes that bhoti language be included in the eighth schedule of the constitution, was hardly a burning issue. ""this just about shows that the congress has not been able to find any issue against the dhumal government"", he added. the prime issue of imposition of user charges in hospitals, which the congress thought it would take up in a big way, also backfired with the chief minister reading a notification indicating that these charges had been implemented by the previous congress government. the party spokesman, however, said that the single factor that outweighed all others which the congress had no answer to, was the determination of this government to make the state self-reliant. in the 47 years of congress rule in the state, no consideration was ever given to this aspect, the net outcome being that the state always remained dependent upon the centre for its financial needs, he said. ""with the completion of the mallana hydel power project the state is earning rs 12 lakh every day, and with the power projects in the pipeline, it will earn enough to make it economically viable on its own,"" he added. he said that the legislature party was of the unanimous of view that it go on an allout offensive against the congress to keep it on the defensive. the legislature party also expressed the opinion that the decisions that had been taken in the past, may it be the lifting of ban on export of khair wood or on shamlaat land being given back to the people had been well received.

19,NHRC notice to Orissa govt on hunger deaths,"new delhi: taking serious note of the deaths caused by starvation and by consuming food unfit for human consumption in orissa, national human rights commission (nhrc) on wednesday issued a notice to the state government seeking a report within one week on the matter. the commission, which took cognizance of a news report in the times of india and electronic media, issued a notice to the state chief secretary for a prompt reply, nhrc sources said. related links ""a notice should be issued by fax to the state chief secretary for a prompt reply within a week giving details of action taken to provide food to the needy and to prevent any such death,"" nhrc chairman j s verma said in his order. according to the news report ""mango kernels, wild roots or starvation death"", at least 20 persons in five villages of orissa have died of either hunger or eating food unfit for human consumption. the report also alleged that all these deaths have evidently escaped the official definition of starvation and claimed that at least 20,000 children and elderly were urgently in need of help in the state. the supreme court, on august 20, had also passed an order saying it was the primary responsibility of centre and state governments to ensure that the food grains, overflowing in the fci godowns, should reach the starving people and not wasted by being dumped in the sea or eaten by rats.

20,Oppn attacks govt over starvation deaths,"new delhi: the government on wednesday came in for a sharp attack from agitated opposition members in the lok sabha over reports of starvation deaths in the country, with their leader sonia gandhi accusing the ruling nda coalition of being a mute spectator to the tragedy. spearheading the attack during zero hour, the leader of opposition said several states were in the grip of a severe drought and there were reports of starvation deaths. such a situation had arisen because of government's bad policy and bad management of public distribution system, she said. related links asking the government to pay immediate attention to the burning issue, the congress president said the crisis was worsening and nothing seemed to have been done to mitigate the sufferings of the people. sharing members' concern, parliamentary affairs minister pramod mahajan said the centre would cooperate with state governments in finding a way to reach foodgrain to the drought-hit people. asserting that godowns were full of foodgrain and there was no shortage, mahajan said the centre could only make available foodgrain to the states and it was their responsibility to ensure that it reached the people. assuring the members' that the centre would not spare any effort to provide relief to the drought-hit people, mahajan said the government was prepared for a full debate on the issue. raising the issue, gandhi said, ""it is heart-breaking that deaths due to starvation are taking place in today's age. it is even more painful that this should be happening when we have over 60 million tonnes of buffer stocks in our godowns."" ""all this is entirely due to bad planning, bad management of our stocks and a bad distribution system,"" she said, adding ""instead of mobilising on a war-footing, the government has been a mute spectator."" stating that the unprecedented situation was getting worse day by day, gandhi demanded that the government should formulate and announce immediate short and long term steps to alleviate the suffering of the people. gandhi said that it was shocking that such tragic events were occurring while granaries were overflowing and thousands of tonnes of grains had been rotting. suggesting that food-for-work programmes should have been launched on a massive scale long ago, she said it is not too late even now. gandhi said that suggestions were given by experts as well as some chief ministers to set up foodgrain banks. ""government's response to these suggestions should have been immediate. yet, for months, as the crisis worsens, nothing significant has been done,"" she said. the government, she added, must formulate a clear-cut policy for enhancing the storage capacity before more foodgrains were wasted. samajwadi party leader mulayam singh yadav said that it appeared that the government was allowing people to die of starvation under the pressure of multi-national companies. several states including orissa, andhra pradesh, maharashtra, uttar pradesh and bihar were facing severe drought and the government was doing nothing, he said. government should not create a situation in which the people revolted and broke open the locks of godowns and looted foodgrain, yadav cautioned.

22,Govt to modify anti-terrorism legislation,"new delhi: government will modify its proposed anti-terrorism legislation to harmonise, to the extent possible, the safeguards for civil liberties with security imperatives, the rajya sabha was told on wednesday. in a written reply, minister of state for home affairs vidyasagar rao said on a reference made by the government in this regard, the law commission had drafted a prevention of terrorism bill, 2000. rao said the bill was circulated among all state governments and union territory administrations for soliciting their comments and only a few rejected outright the idea of having such a law. however, most of the states have expressed apprehensions about possible misuse of various provisions of the bill under consideration, including violation of human rights. the minister said the national human rights commission (nhrc) has opined that there was no need to enact such a law. the government would take into account the views and comments of the state governments as well as the nhrc, which are now available, while modifying the bill. it will also hold consultations with political parties, other interest groups etc. before taking a final view on the matter, the minister added.

23,NC leaders fear Central 'deal' with separatists on polls,"jammu: many national conference leaders believe that the timing of prime minister atal bihari vajpayee's assurance of ""free and fair"" elections in jammu and kashmir, coming as it did during his independence day address to the nation, was significant and was ""most probably"" an articulation of a public commitment sought by some moderate separatist leaders, who may have ""privately"" expressed an inclination to participate in the next elections in the state. these leaders believe that ""shabir shah, abdul ghani lone and may be maulvi omar farooq"" have given in indication that they could participate in the elections if their fairness was assured. g.m. bawan said: ""the pm's assurance was apparently a public commitment to particular separatist leaders as well as a general promise to other estranged people."" underlining his observation about ""commitment to particular separatist leaders"", he added: ""otherwise there was no reason for the pm to choose the occasion to make the statement."" critics point out that the sharp reaction of the nc leadership reflects a ""sense of insecurity"" at the prospect of having to share the electoral turf with some separatist leaders. party general secretary sheikh nazir, making his own interpolations in the pm's statement, said: ""the pm's statement about rigged elections in the state reflected the frustration of the communal brigade over its defeat in the recent assembly elections."" chief minister farooq abdullah went a step further and said: ""not farooq abdullah but the union government is a crook and must own responsibility (for any unfair elections)."" critics cite the ""critical junctures"" when there were ""strong moves"" from the centre to involve the separatists in negotiations, and the nc showed a knee-jerk or plain ""caddish"" reaction. one was last year when the nc bulldozed the autonomy resolution through the assembly in a especially called session, even though, as claimed by some central leaders, the cm had given the assurance that the resolution would be only discussed and not passed. during their speeches in the house, ministers and other nc members accused the union governments of being ""beimaan (dishonest)"" with the state and ""constantly hatching conspiracies against the nc"". another occasion being cited is when farooq started vociferously opposing the unilateral ceasefire declared by the centre, which had hoped talks with the separatists could be started. various nc functionaries have again started orchestrating the ""conspiracies against the nc"" theme. this, however, is being seen not as an expression of rebellion but a bid to ""try to impress the people in the valley"". a party leader confided that there is an ""internal understanding"" within the party that the cm will normally make guarded statements, present a pro-centre face, while other partymen, if they choose, would be free to indulge in centre-bashing ""to tickle the humour of the kashmiri people"". the cm, who overstepped this general understanding, has now cooled down.

24,Cadila Bridge incident figures at AMC meet,"ahmedabad: the monthly general board meeting of amc witnessed a shouting match of sorts between the saffron brigade and congress men when congress corporator from dariapur, hasan lala raised the cadila bridge issue. lala accused break down of law and order in ahmedabad and said that prompt action should be taken to arrest anti-socials who are terrorising the economically deprived masses. leader of the opposition at amc, dharmendra shah, immediately retaliated with counter allegations with ""loud"" support from some other party members. the issue threatened to bring down the house when mayor himmatsinh patel stepped in and called for the topic to be struck from general board's agenda. lala then trained his guns on the state government's apparent dilly-dallying tactics on coming out with a clear-cut policy for rebuilding collapsed houses. the dariapur corporator said: ""more than 1,500 middle-class families are the hardest hit because the corporation is not able to pass their building plans as the state government is not clear on its building by-laws."" once again a shouting match ensued and only quelled when the mayor called for decorum in the house. patel then called deputy municipal commissioner, vinay vyasa, who was deputising for the municipal commissioner at the board to reply on the issue. vyasa told the house that of the 17 plans submitted for collapsed buildings 11 have been passed. we have written to the state government for clarification on whether the building plans submitted to the corporation (sans the wilful deviations like extra balcony cover or even illegal storeys) be okayed or should the consequent changes be incorporated. the government is working on this issue and will soon issue a reply.

25,Recent riots expose poor surveillance,"ahmedabad: when an organisation called muslim youth association gave a call for a bandh in the city on friday, the police did not know anything about this outfit and hardly took notice of the strike call. it dismissed the bandh call on the basis that even the muslim vyapari mandal had given it in writing to the police that it would not support the strike. but a surprise was in store for everybody, including the state intelligence bureau, when the bandh evoked an overwhelming response and even turned violent, leading to imposition of curfew for three days in dariapur. it now turns out that hundreds of pamphlets were circulated in the minority-dominated areas and the preparations for the bandh were elaborate. and while police officials are now discussing the failure of the intelligence network in the state, an intelligence official said, ""all our intelligence gathering is through our police force. we haven't developed a network of paid agents because we don't want to spend money on getting vital information."" the officials says that the entire police force spends barely rs 1.5 lakh every year on payments to informers. the amount comes to around rs 12,000 every month for all the 25 districts! but lack of resources is not the only problem plaguing the intelligence gathering establishment in gujarat police. officials engaged in policing and intelligence gathering admit that it is very difficult for a man in uniform or a plain-clothed policeman to gather intelligence, apart from the fact that they are hardly trained in surveillance. ""intelligence is the job of intelligent people. the kind of personnel we have in the police force hardly know how to be discreet and carry out a covert operation,"" an official said. the state ib chief g c raigar said he had ""a reasonable apparatus"" to gather intelligence and gauge such events. ""on most occasions we are accurate, but one must realise that intelligence is a difficult job. it is difficult to predict the human mind, especially if it is up to some mischief,"" he said. ""be it the bajrang dal or organisations like simi, we should have insiders who have penetrated deep inside these outfits providing us information,"" says another official. he says it is easier to keep tab on militant hindu organisations because ""they are normally more open about their plans and shout from roof-tops."" however, with an array of hindutva organisations from the rss and vhp to bajrang dal, things can become complicated because there is no clear line of command or organisational uniformity. in the case of muslim outfits, there is a lot of ""general intelligence"" but very little ""operational intelligence"". giving an example, an official said, ""a lot has been said about the growing number of islamic madrasas in border areas of kutch, but we have no idea of what is being taught there."" police officials say that when it comes to the minority community, even if there are people who are upset with the goings on within the community, they would not like to report it to the authorities who lack credibility. police officials also feel that with new outfits like simi and now the muslim youth association taking charge of the situation, the police needs to develop new channels of information because the older leadership _ which remained largely in the hands of the congress _ was no longer in control of the community. ""we all realise that it is not the common man who sparks off a communal riot. it has to have an individual or organisational backing, and these centres of trouble need to be identified because they are changing fast,"" says one official. ahmedabad police commissioner p c pande, however, denied that there was any intelligence 'failure' as far as the bandh and the subsequent riots last week were concerned. ""there is nothing that is not known to us. we realise that a new leadership is trying to emerge creating social pressures which will manifest themselves in violence,"" he said.

26,Turning their backs on a violent neighbourhood,"ahmedabad: a gun shot in dariapur and horrifying memories come booming back to vijay thakkar. memories of frustrating helplessness of being huddled inside his three-storeyed house, seeing his father almost die of a massive-heart attack, without being able to do as much as go out and fetch a doctor or buy a life-saving pill! ""dariapur had turned into one communal battlefield. friends had overnight turned into sworn enemies. i have personally witnessed one man baying for another man's blood, people butchering each other, setting each other on fire,"" reminisces thakkar who used to reside outside the dariapur khadawad-ni-pol near swaminarayan temple till 1985. his father's illness in the midst of heavy rioting and curfew became the turning-point for thakkar who immediately shifted to safer confines of a gujarat housing board house in sola road. ""i could not take that pressure anymore .... the sense of insecurity was too unnerving to live in peace. i had a responsibility towards my family and thought it best in the interest of all to leave the place,"" concedes thakkar with a pang of guilt for having deserted his ancestral house of 25 years. torn between a similar love for ancestral home and family safety was prof mm chunawala. chunawala used to live in a majestic 16-bedroom haveli near nagar sheth na vanda outside collector office for over 50 years but was forced to shift residence to a modest flat in muslim society in navrangpura in 1992. reason? prof had started feeling insecure as more and houses in his area were bought over by hindus. ""i had started feeling a little insecure what with communal violence becoming a way of life in the walled city. there was not a single family of my community residing till far and i felt this need to be with my own people, to feel secure in a group,"" confesses prof chunawala. he has some exceptionally sweet memories of his hindu neighbours during the 1985 riots. ""my neighbours had been very nice to me, very caring, protective. i remember we people staying in one house during the riots and they even buying even vegetables and milk for me. they had tried to dissuade me from moving out like nobody's business,"" recalls prof chunawala. having shifted homes away from the sensitive areas, how safe do they feel now? bank officer bihari patel, who shifted out of his home of 25 years in khanpur to an apartment in gurukul on december 4, 1994 to strategically avoid the possibility of communal violence on the first anniversary of babri masjid demolition, too is happy about his decision. ""i have seen lived through many curfews and frankly, it is not worth it. here, i am a free man. there is no fear, no worry"", says patel. ""whenever there is news of communal disturbance, i feel assured of having taken the right decision. but i have not been able to break-free of the fear totally as some of my family still stays in the walled city,"" says thakkar. prof chunawala too shares similar sentiments but confesses that somewhere he and those of his ilk in both communities are falling victims to ghettoisation, a phenomenon that can prove dangerous in the future. ""what is happening is dangerous for the city, the police and even for the government. as parts of the city turn into fiefdoms for respective communities, it will become virtually impossible for the police to penetrate and check the simmering communal feelings,"" fears prof chunawala.

28,Schoolteachers hold rally; announce indefinite bandh,"ahmedabad: the gujarat rajya shaikshanik sangh sankalan samiti on tuesday called for an indefinite bandh of around 5,500 secondary and higher secondary schools across the state. in a massive show of strength, over 50,000 teachers, principals, representatives of school managements and administrative employees converged at the gh-0 circle in gandhinagar to stage a protest rally against the government's inaction to fulfil long-pending demands of principals, teachers and other staff of the secondary and higher secondary schools. announcing the indefinite school bandh state-wide, president of sankalan samiti keshubhai patel also called upon the teachers to totally boycott any work related to the gujarat secondary education board. the state government, however, described the rally and the school-bandh call as a ploy by teachers to hold education system and the society at a ransom. the indefinite fast is an extension of the long-time fight being put up by the federation to press for their demands. the three main demands put forward by the samiti include 100 per cent recruitment of teachers in all grant-in-aid schools (the samiti has demanded that the state government urgently issue a gr announcing the same), vehicle allowance for teachers and also that the teachers be given fifth pay commission arrears as accorded by the centre. last month, the federation had called for a state-wide school bandh that had met near-total response what with almost all of 5,500 schools remaining closed in protest. this was followed by a recent programme of teachers shaving their moustaches in protest against government inaction. in its reaction to the massive rally and school-bandh call, bjp state general secretary gordhan zadaphia described the rally and the bandh-call as a ploy to hold the education system and the society to ransom. ""i have been personally mediating between the samiti and the state government to resolve issues in the past and the present issues would have been resolved too. the bandh ,lan is unnecessary"", zadaphia said. ""the teachers earn salaries between rs 12,000-15,000. one can understand if a starving man indulges in such demonstrations but the teachers are being misguided into holding education at a ransom by some politically motivated elements,"" zadaphia said. zadaphia said the state government has effectively discussed the issues what with education minister anandiben patel, chief minister keshubhai patel discussing the matter. ""we insist that there is still room for discussion and debate. holding education at ransom does not augur well for the state,"" zadaphia insisted.

29,Cabinet discusses minister-officer tussle,"thiruvananthapuram: in a curious development, the kerala cabinet on wednesday, discussed the stand-off between education minister nalakath soopy and an ias official but left undecided whether or not to take action. the issue cropped up recently after alphonse kannamthanam, commissioner of entrance examinations said in public that the minister had asked him a favour in the common entrance test results. soopy had denied it but the official held his grounds. in media interviews he gave soon after, the commissioner had said if the chief minister sought information he would provide him with proof. antony, responding to media querries, decried the bureaucratic tendency to go to public on matters of this nature. while he refused to enter in to merits of the allegation, the chief minister said, bureaucracy must work within the framework of service rules. the rules demanded that the secretaries and other officials must seek the help and guidance of the chief secretary who in turn will discuss the matters with the chief minister. an official should not discuss in public or through media matters in his department. ""the government views it with concern that officials discuss matters of governance. the officialdom is bound by the government policies"". asked if the cabinet had considered action to be taken against the official for his ""lapses"", the chief minister refused to commit himself to any specific action. he said the minister had explained his position in the cabinet meeting and the latter had convinced itself that soopy had not violated him oath. but antony brushed aside a suggestion that when the cabinet heard the minister justice demanded that the official too be heard. kannamthanam has since been shifted to another department.

30,Antony to ask party to pay flight bill,"thiruvananthapuram: kerala chief minister a k antony will approach the aicc to pay the sum of rs 31 lakh for using the air force aircraft from delhi to thiruvananthapuram in 1995. it was earlier reported that the state government will pay the money. antony told a media meeting at thrissur on sunday that the cash-trapped state could not dole out such a sum at this juncture. the payment was disputed ever since the defence ministry had sent the bills to the kerala government. by then the state was taken over by the left front (ldf) government. the ldf refused to pay the fare for hiring a special plane since the trip was neither in an urgent public interest nor in a ministerial capacity. antony used the plane on suggestions of the then prime minsiter p v narasimha rao. antony was named to replace his senior k karunakaran as chief minister. karunakaran had fallen from the favour of the then congress chief and pm in the aftermath of the infamous isro spy scandal. it is said that antony had pleaded for a scheduled flight but the prime minister insisted on his travelling in a special flight. the refusal to pay the bill by the leftist nayanar government saw the bill being shuttled between delhi and thiruvananthapuram. this continued for all these years. when he travelled, antony was neither holding a party position nor a mininstership. he was only a chief minister-designate which does not entitle him to travel in a hired flight unless the government specifically agreed to pay the bill. the original bill was for rs 14.69 lakh. but with interest at the rate of 18 per cent accumulating, the total sum has now reached rs 31 lakh. when the issue was brought to the notice of antony in 1996, he said he was not approached by the air force for payment. ""i cannot pay such a big sum myself. if it is insisted on me, i shall appeal to the people of kerala to donate me a coin each to raise the money"", he had declared at a public meeting after he was taunted by the detrators and the marxists on the issue.

""though it is very difficult for anyone to strictly adhere to ethical norms in the face of extreme resistance from various negative forces of the environment, yet ethical values can be nurtured and practised if we are strong in our conduct and behaviour and remain prepared to sacrifice some comforts and conveniences,"" she stressed. earlier, sita ram chaturvedi, deputy general manager of the bank said that human values and ethical norms played a vital role not only in individual life, but also in organisational functioning.
