0,Distrust reigned in SGPC election,"CHANDIGARH: Former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal and former SGPC president Gurcharan Singh Tohra had to face disappointment from unexpected quarters in the SGPC election held this week.

If Badal was cheated by his onetime close confidants like Mal Singh Ghuman and Jagdev Singh Talwandi, Tohra had his own pack of detractors, led by none other than Simranjit Singh Mann.

In spite of his overwhelming victory, Badal feels cheated by Ghuman and Talwandi at a moment when he expected them to pay him back for the favours he had granted them as chief minister.

Talwandi, who switched over his loyalties to the Tohra camp at the last moment, was handpicked by Badal to be president of SGPC in 2000 and subsequently his elder son was appointed chairman of Punjab State Small Scale Industries and Exports Corporation (PSIEC) while the younger one, convicted in a murder case, was allowed to move around on parole and was subsequently allotted an SAD ticket from Raikot constituency, from where he won in the last assembly election.

Badal, no more in power, surely did not expect that he would be paid back by Talwandi thus. Similarly, Ghuman, who also enjoyed Badal''s confidence no less and was ''appointed'' chairman of Markfed, where he wielded immense power as a key administrator, also ditched Badal close to the SGPC election.

Ghuman chose to rebel against Badal by floating a seven-member committee which wanted a religious person to be appointed SGPC president.

In his campaign, Ghuman openly played into the hands of Tohra and senior Panthic Morcha leader Ravi Inder Singh, a close friend of chief minister Amarinder Singh.

On the other hand, Tohra also did not have a pleasant experience while attempting a coup against the Badal camp.

The Tohra faction, which got support from the seven-member Ghuman committee, had in fact decided to field Sant Mitha Singh as its presidential candidate.

However, to seek additional support of four SGPC members, the group held last-minute deliberations with Mann for a consensus candidate.

Mann reportedly told Tohra that if Vir Singh Madoke was nominated presidential candidate, he would lend support.

In their zeal to muster as much support as possible, the Tohra-Ghuman camp reportedly agreed to field Madoke. Yet, the Mann group with its four members abstained from voting and did not back the proposed candidate.

Mann''s decision, in retrospect, might not have played a decisive role in tilting the scales but it surely reflected the ingrained sense of distrust among senior Akali leaders.

1,"World Bank report indicts govt, officials","LUCKNOW: The World Bankâ€™s report â€˜Poverty in India, The Challenge of Uttar Pradeshâ€™, is a candid depiction of the situation in the state which ""once appeared positioned to be the pace-setter for Indiaâ€™s economic and social development.""

It is also a strong indictment of the political class and bureaucracy: The state ""now shows less promise.""

With an estimated eight per cent of the worldâ€™s poor already living in UP, the WB report says that ""UPâ€™s poor risk falling further and further behind if reforms to accelerate poverty reduction fail to accelerate.""

The report will be presented by Valerie Kozel, senior economist of the WB, here on Monday. The report states that ""human deprivation is an important aspect of poverty in UP. The report mentions the progress made in the field of literacy (from 42 per cent in 1991 to 57 per cent in 2001) but it was still well below the all-India average of 65 per cent. Also, at 43 per cent the female literacy rate was way behind the national average of 54 per cent.

The governmentâ€™s sincerity towards increasing the literacy rate can be gauged from the manner in which it is dithering to implement the mid-day meal scheme despite the Supreme Courtâ€™s order. While the government can afford wasteful expenditure worth crores on projects like Parivartan Chowk and Ambedkar Udyan, it is reluctant to start the mid-day meal scheme.

A section in the report is aptly titled The Causes: Poverty of Resources, Access, and Relationships. Public services often bypass poor men and women. Infrastructure development, including provision for drinking and irrigation water, sanitation, electricity and public transport is very low in UP.

Moreover, in UP there is also ""poverty of access to public goods and services"" and the ""poor suffer from poverty of social relations.""

The report describes as predatory the behaviour of government officials who prey on the poor. The four reasons given in the report for the ""progressive deterioration in governance"" is an apt summation of the hopeless situation. Hopeless, because there is neither the political earnestness nor the stability. The bureaucracy also is unwilling to allow accountability, for both inefficiency and corruption, and transparency.

""First, the administration has become increasingly politicised, which has eroded the stability of tenure and undercut managerial authority; second, administrative fragmentation has led to a proliferation of senior positions and undermined coordination and accountability in administration as policy-making; third, a related expansion in the size of the civil service, combined with weak revenue generation, placed a squeeze on the capital budget as well as spending on operations and maintenance; and fourth, poor expenditure management practices have undermined the efficacy of public spending for combating poverty in the state. UPâ€™s continuing political instability has contributed to the politicisation and undermined the effectiveness of the administration.""

He said the Samata national executive, during its recent meeting at Rajkot, had announced the schedule for conducting the organisational polls. Accusing the state government of negligence in protecting the railways in Bihar, Kumar said the report of commissioner of railway safety with regard to the September 9 Rajdhani disaster in which 116 passengers were killed in Aurangabad district had belied the state government''s claim.

3,Advani gives clean chit to Marandi government,"RANCHI: Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani on Friday joined hands with NDA allies and the Babulal Marandi government in glorifying the achievements of Jharkhand on the second foundation day of the state.

During his five-hour visit to the state capital, which had been spruced up and readied for the occasion, Advani gave a clean chit to the state government and said that its performance over the last two years had been very good, specially in the areas of roads and education.

Addressing a mammoth gathering at the local Morabadi grounds here, which was dressed up like a bride, with huge cutouts of the tribal legends Birsa Munda and Albert Ekka adorning two sides of the main dais, the Dy PM took a dig at Pakistan, saying that Pak has still not forgotten its ""wounds"" of 1947 when the people of erstwhile princely state of Jammu and Kashmir opted to merge with India than Pakistan.

After Pakistan fought and lost several wars with India since 1947, its former president Zia-ul-Haq trained his people to continue to wage a proxy war against India in the form of cross-border terrorism, Advani asserted amidst slogans of ""Jai Sriram"" from the public.

""I am often asked on my trips abroad whether India would wage a war against Pakistan, and my reply has always been that India is already at war with Pakistan.""

Underlining the fact that Jharkhand is one of the leading mineral rich state of the country, Advani claimed that this state could pave the way for India becoming one of the most developed countries in the world. The deputy PM, said to be Marandi''s mentor, set the deadline of 2010 for Jharkhand to achieve its developmental target.

Other Union ministers present on the occasion included railway minister Nitish Kumar, external affairs minister Yashwant Sinha, rural and industries minister Karia Munda, civil supplies minister Sharad Yadav and junior minister of human resources Rita Verma, who patted the back of the NDA government at the Centre for creating three new statesâ€”Jharkhand, Uttaranchal and Chhatisgarhâ€”as promised.

Common man''s participation in the celebrations was poor and the opposition observed black day in Ranchi, Ulihatu and Godda in protest againt the bad performance of the Marandi government.

Later taking to mediapersons Advani said that Centre would not like to initiate any dialogue with the VHP in this connection and that it was for Gujarat to take a decision on the issue.

""Negotiations can be held at the party level but the Centre will not be interested in negotiating the issue with VHP,"" said Advani and asserted that the outcome of the Gujarat elections will not have any effect on the NDA government at the Centre. ""Outcome of state elections seldom affect the ruling party in New Delhi,"" he said.

Reiterating that the recently held elections in Jammu and Kashmir was a huge victory of the people of state.

5,Patnaik expels 3 rebel BJD MPs from party,"BHUBANESWAR: The crisis in the ruling Biju Janata Dal (BJD) in Orissa deepened on Saturday with party President Naveen Patnaik expelling three rebel Lok Sabha MPs from the primary membership of the outfit for a period of six years for their continued anti-party activities.

The three MPs -- Prabhat Samantaray, Kumudini Patnaik and Jagannath Mallick had been placed under suspension by Patnaik earlier on August 9 on the same charges.

The decision to expel them was taken by the party chief after due consultations with senior party leaders and office bearers, BJD Secretary General and Panchayatiraj Minister, Damodar Rout told newspersons here.

Patnaik, who left here for Delhi on Saturday afternoon, has also summoned a meeting of the BJD members in both houses of Parliament there on Sunday to discuss the nomination or election of office bearers of the BJD Parliamentary party, Rout said.

Six members of the ten-member BJD group in Lok Sabha, including the three MPs expelled on Saturday, had staged a virtual coup on September 17 last when they decided to replace Union Water Resources Minister Arjun Charan Sethi as leader of the BJDPP and elected Prasanna Acharya in his place.

This had taken the party leadership completely by surprise and it received a further jolt recently when the Lok Sabha Speaker recognised Acharya as the leader of the BJDPP in the lower house.

9,Govt failed to bail out farmers: CLP,"KHAMMAM: Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader Y S Rajasekhara Reddy on Saturday came down heavily on the government for what he called its indifference to the problems of farmers in the state.

Talking to reporters here during his one-day visit to the district, the CLP leader alleged that the government failed to tackle drought and had only aggravated the problems confronting the farm sector. ""The government failed miserably in bailing out farmers,"" he said.

Rajasekhara Reddy visited Manuguru, Tekulapally and Kothagudem and spoke to farmers to get a first hand information on the drought. ""We have suggested several alternatives to come up with permanent solutions to tackle drought. But the government had refused to look into our suggestions,"" the CLP leader said.

Our suggestions included optimum utilisation of groundwater by digging more agricultural wells and borewells to help farmers who had taken up dry crops, completion of pending projects in a time-bound manner, he said.

Earlier, the CLP leader, who arrived here from Vijayawada by train, was received at the Khammam railway station amidst pushing, jostling and scuffles.

12,Govt attitude coming in way of NRI investments: Canadian MP,"SAS NAGAR: The Punjabisâ€™ living in Canada, who have earned a name through sheer hard-work are dying to do their bit for their homeland. But the onus lies on the Punjab Government to instil confidence that their investments would be safe and that they would not face harassment.

This was stated by MP, Canadian House of Commons and parliamentary secretary to the minister of labour, Canadian government, Gurbax Singh Malhi while addressing a news conference organised by the Mohali Industries Association here on Saturday.

Malhi said that the nonresident Indians who had tried to invest in Punjab in the 1990s had a bitter experience. They were now unwilling to help their home state because of a non cooperative government, he said.

Criticising the political establishment and the bureaucratic machinery Malhi said, ""The previous government was notorious for creating problems for NRI investors and we have not yet received any positive signals from the Congress government as well.""

The MLA from Kharar, Bir Devinder Singh, who was also present assured the Canadian MP that the Congress government would do every thing in its powers to facilitate the NRIs who want to invest in the state.

""A full fledged NRI department, headed by a commissioner, had been set up by the government to arrange visits of NRI delegation,"" he said, adding that similar departments would be set up at all districts to facilitate the NRIs.

Advising the youth of Punjab who dream to go abroad, Malhi said ""There are many unscrupulous persons who exploit the youth and take them abroad illegally.""

Anyone wishing to go abroad should consult the embassy and come through the proper procedure, he said adding that in Canada it is very tough for an illegal immigrant to stay.

13,Anti-incumbency factor may influence polling pattern,"AHMEDABAD: This year''s state assembly polls could put even the psephologists in a quandary as they would be held after months-long communal riots which left behind a perceptible pattern of polarisation and an earthquake from which part of the state is yet to recover. Not to talk about the drought, which is yet to show its ugly face.

Analysts believe that apart from the traditional caste factor, the anti-incumbency factor would also influence the polling pattern at two levels at least. Interestingly, while the BJP dominated the state assembly with 119 seats, the local civic bodies went in favour of the Congress with at least 80 per cent of gram panchayats getting allied with them in the elections, held in December, going by the party''s claim.

Chief Minister Narendra Modi even tried wooing the electorate at the grassroots with the ''Samras'' scheme, where the government promised cash doles to villages which co-opted their sarpanchs. This scheme, surprisingly found no mention in Modi''s speeches during the Gaurav Yatra, which passed through ''Samras'' villages. The BJP had claimed dominance over 64 per cent of the gram panchayats.

In the case of the district and taluka panchayats, the Congress emerged victorious and grabbed 21 of the 23 district panchayats and 168 of the 223 taluka panchayats. These results showed that the Congress had a strong grassroot base, while the BJP was preferred in the urban centres.

Elections to the Kheda and Banaskantha district panchayats have not been held yet. Even in the case of nagar panchayats and municipalities, the balance is tilted in favour of the Congress which controls most of these organisations.

It is at these levels that the anti-incumbency factor is likely to affect polling trends. Dismissing its effect as minuscule, BJP MP from Ahmedabad Harin Pathak says, ""It will affect to a certain extent, but will not influence results because the winning margins in the assembly elections are high.""

Harping on the fact that voters will reject the pseudo-secularism of the Congress ""which was exposed after Godhra"", he adds that issues like good governance, non-corrupt administration and Narmada waters, would decide the fate of the elections. Putting the blame on the Congress for compelling the BJP to resort to Hindutva, he says, ""Despite our honest efforts of not to make Hindutva an issue, we have been forced to because of the pseudo-secularism of the Congress.""

According to him, ""In rural centres, local issues are taken into consideration and here the winning margins are not very high, so anti-incumbency affects to an extent, which is not the case in urban centres.""

Pathak points out the problem of electricity as an emerging damper in the rural areas for the ruling party. Congress MP Madhusudan Mistry believes that anti-incumbency would play a major role. About the Congress dominance of local self-government bodies he says, ""People know that the BJP government did not allow any rural programmes to be implemented."" He also says, ""In the six months of Modi-rule there were 413 announcements of which 48 per cent were not implemented and the rest were done half-heartedly.""

Interestingly, while Modi played the Hindutva card during the Gaurav Yatra, Congress chief Shankersinh Vaghela decided to dwell on the problems of power and employment during his campaign. What will affect voter psyche - religion or caste - remains a matter of deliberation.

14,No banners and flags on VMC property for polls,"VADODARA: This year ''banner'' campaigning would be a tough job for political parties. After cracking down on the BJP, for damaging public property during the recent Gaurav Yatra, Vadodara Municipal Corporation now plans to ensure that no political party defaces its property.

This year, elections might not be synonymous with defaced walls splattered with ''vote for'' signs or party symbols. VMC commissioner Arvind Aggarwal, has issued instructions to all ward officers asking them to ensure that no banners, flags or other materials are strung across VMC property in their respective wards. ""This would include, roads, electricity poles, VMC buildings or any other structure that belongs to the VMC,"" Aggarwal told TNN.

However, various political parties have already ordered large consignments of flags and banners for display on roads. ""In the past we have used banners for displaying our party symbol and candidate. But all this would be as per the norms set by the Election Commission. We will use public property and later pay the VMC for its use,"" said city BJP unit media cell in-charge, Vanraj Shah.

Aggarwal had taken objection to the BJP damaging roads and dividers to put up banners and flags during the Gaurav Yatra. ""We have already started cleaning up places where these flags and banners have come up,"" he said.

Citizens here have also expressed their displeasure over the way the Sanskarnagri gets defaced every time elections or political programmes are held. They say that the VMC should charge a hefty fine if norms are not followed. Yatish Baxi a resident of the old city area says, ""Political parties should understand that public property or even private property cannot be defaced for ''prachar'' (publicity). If they want to campaign, they can go door-to-door, give out pamphlets and handouts to inform the public about the candidates that they represent.""

As per EC guidelines, defacement of property is not allowed. No political party, or candidate or supporters can use private property without the permission of the owner of the property.

However, this norm does not seem to deter political parties. Most major political parties have planned to use cloth banners, to be put up across city roads.

""We shall use the banners and display them as per the EC norms,"" says city Congress general secretary Bhogilal Patel.
