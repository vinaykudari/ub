0,Two members of Anoop gang arrested,"NEW DELHI: The crime branch arrested two alleged musclemen of the dreaded Anoop gang on Friday in northwest Delhi. The police said Surinder Khatri (27) and Jaibir Singh (28) were carrying a 9 mm automatic pistol along with four live cartridges and a knife.

â€˜â€˜The arrest is a part of the drive against criminals who create disturbances during the elections. They were seen moving about suspiciously near the State Bank of India branch at Samaipur Badli. They were nabbed after a brief scuffle with our team,â€™â€™ said deputy commissioner of police (crime) Dependra Pathak. The two men have been booked under the Arms Act and a case registered against them in Samaipur Badli police station.

â€˜â€˜On interrogation, they revealed they were members of the Anoop gang. Khatri is involved in five cases of murder which took place at Narela and Najafgarh,â€™â€™ said Pathak.

Khatri had been sentenced to life imprisonment in a murder case by a trial court, said the official. He had allegedly been hiding in Haryana and had shifted to northwest Delhi a few weeks ago.

The police said Khatri urgently needed money and was planning to rob a bank customer when he was nabbed along with Singh. He also revealed that an election candidate in the district had sought his services.

1,PMC curbs on water usage evoke protests,"PUNE: The Pune Municipal Corporationâ€™s decision to prosecute citizens found using municipal water supply for washing their vehicles and gardening has evoked strong protests from the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Patit Pavan Sanghatana.

BJP corporators have written municipal commissioner Sanjay Kumar demanding withdrawal of Thursdayâ€™s PMC order.

The corporators have instead urged the civic water department first prevent leakages in the supply system, which they claim amount to a 30 per cent water loss.

They have also pooh-poohed former mayor Shantilal Suratwalaâ€™s suggestion, which led to latest decision, that use of purified tap water for gardening and car-washing purposes, amounts to wastage.

Suratwala, during his tenure as mayor, ordered the washing of city streets with the tap water, they pointed out.

The PPS has objected to the civic water departmentâ€™s threat to prosecute office-bearers of housing societies and flat-owners, where water storage tanks are found overflowing.

â€œWhile the citizens should be urged to use water judiciously, they should not be criminally prosecuted,â€� Niranjan Phadke of the PPS has said.

Interestingly, in a proposal tabled before the PMC six months ago, additional municipal commissioner D S Zagade had pointed out that charging water tax at a flat rate, based on property tax not water consumtion, was leading to wastage of water. The proposal is still pending approval.

2,"Bootleg, but all they have to do is act naturally!","PUNE: If the turnout at the Corinthian Club on Friday was anything to go by, the magic of the Beatles is dying, at least in Pune.

Maybe, the Rs 300 price tag per person was the villain. Still, the Bootleg Beatles were everything but the word â€˜bootlegâ€™ stands for.

They were a surprise, they were hard hitting, they were almost like the real thing. Were the real John Lennon alive, he would have played another half-an-hour for the fans who had gathered to hear their favourite band.

But when Neil Harrison, the John Lennon for the last 25 years, played Hey Jude as the last song of the evening, it was almost a teaser for the Pune crowd used to rocking at 10 in the night.

To take nothing away from the make-up, hair, costumes and music of the Bootleg Beatles, they captured for Pune the magic of what it must have been like to hear John, Paul, George and Ringo play Here comes the sun.

Long live the Beatles, long live Neil Harrison, Andre Barreau, David Birch and Gary Bentley.

3,YSR challenges Naidu to a debate on development,"HYDERABAD: The Congress has challenged the chief minister for a debate on the relative development of Andhra Pradesh in the last nine years vis-a-vis the Congress-ruled states.

â€œLet Chandrababu Naidu fix the venue and time as per his convenience and we will prove our point that AP lagged in all spheres compared to the states rule by our party,â€� Congress leader Y S Rajasekhara Reddy told reporters on Friday.

Quoting extensively from the documents of Planning Commission, Reserve Bank of India, and United Nations Development Programme, the opposition leader said the state had been ranked below Karnataka, Rajasthan, Kerala, Delhi and Madhya Pradesh on several fronts. The state slipped to fifth position in IT exports, while it failed to attract more than 5 per cent of the foreign direct investment in the country, Rajasekhara Reddy said.

He wanted the chief minister to bring the naxalites groups to a negotiating table and resolve the extremist problem. â€œJust because we are suggesting this Naidu should not interpret it that the Congress is endorsing the activities of Peopleâ€™s War,â€� he said.

On public debate, Rajasekhara Reddy said he saw no reason why Sonia should take on Chandrababu Naidu as she is the president of a national party, while Naidu represents a regional party. â€œSuch an occasion will come if BJP fields its president or the prime minister for the debate,â€� he said, pointing out that state leaders are enough to take on Naidu.

â€œNo development, atrocities against women are on the rise, farmers continue to commit suicide, increase in HIV cases, rampant corruption and indiscriminate borrowings are the hallmarks of the TDP government,â€� the opposition leader said.

4,Non-bailable arrest warrant against official,"PATNA: A single bench of the Patna High Court issued a non-bailable warrant of arrest against a senior IAS officer, V Jaishankar, with a directive to the Bihar police to produce him on November 24 at 10.30 am as neither the officer appeared on his own nor did the police produce him in the court on Friday. The bench was presided over by Justice Radha Mohan Prasad.

The same bench had issued a warrant of arrest against Jaishankar on Thursday as he did not turn up despite summons issued to him by it in connection with a contempt of court matter arising out of the failure to comply with an earlier high court order regarding the payment of retirement dues to an employee. Jaishankar is currently posted as commissioner in the water resources department of the state government.

Producing Jaishankarâ€™s letter in the court, standing counsel V N Singh said he has gone to New Delhi as one of his family members or relatives is seriously ill there. Describing Jaishankar as the â€œmost irresponsible officerâ€�, Justice Prasad directed Singh to tell the government to take action against such an officer. The contents of the letter sent by Jaishankar to the court do not tally with the court records, the judge added.

The letter of Jaishankar to Singh also figured in the order given in another case by Chief Justice Ravi S Dhavan while presiding over a division bench. Without naming the officer, this bench stated that he (standing counsel) told the court that he had received â€œa nasty letterâ€� from the head of a department telling him that the state counselâ€™s job â€œis not to enter into a dialogue but to say exactly what he has been instructedâ€�.

LPA case adjourned: An LPA case filed by the widow of a class IV employee after having been denied family pension was adjourned on Friday by a division bench of the Patna High Court for a fortnight on the assurance of chief secretary K A H Subramanian that he would look into the matter.

The bench comprised Chief Justice Ravi S Dhavan and Justice S K Singh. Petitioner Roopkali Devi was denied family pension on the ground that an employee in a â€œwork-charge establishmentâ€� cannot get pension despite the fact that her deceased husband had been transferred from â€œwork-charge establishmentâ€� and given a scale of pay and promotion. Her husband had died in harness. When her writ petition was dismissed, she filed the LPA.

The bench, in its order, said this is a case where the might of the state is ranged against a hapless widow, telling her that she has no case, no right to receive a widowâ€™s pension. â€œThe answer must satisfy administrative justice first; the court comes later. Has the widow received administrative justice?â€� asked the bench.

5,"Hold all-party meeting on Assam, Modi tells Rabri","PATNA: The leader of opposition in the state assembly, Sushil Kumar Modi, on Friday requested the CM Rabri Devi to immediately convene an all-party meeting to discuss the recent incidents of violence in Bihar and Assam.

Expressing his surprise over the stay of the Bihar chief minister in Delhi for five days when Biharis were being killed in Assam, Modi on Friday said that the state government should take preventive steps to stop any further violence aimed at North-Eastern states people passing through Bihar.

Modi said that the convening of an all-party meeting had become all the more necessary since Biharis living in Assam started returning to their home state in large numbers. There was every possibility of these people narrating their harrowing experience in the wake of attack on people living in North-Eastern region to their folks. This could trigger further violence in Bihar which had to be prevented at any cost, Modi added.

Holding the state administration responsible for the Jamalpur incident in which miscreants attacked some women from Nagaland and Assam on November 11/12, Modi said that the removal of Munger DM, SP and railway SP, Jamalpur, was a clear admission of the fact that the local administration had failed to prevent attack on them.

Modi asked the CBI to investigate the roles allegedly played by deputy inspector general (DIG) of police, Munger range, Ganesh Prasad Yadav, officer in-charge of Jamalpur east colony police station Manoj Yadav and chairman of Jamalpur municipality and RJD leader Bharath Yadav in the incident of misbehaviour with the Naga women.

6,'Dowry death' sparks violence in city centre,"KOLKATA: An alleged dowry death sparked violence at Chandni Chowk market in central Kolkata on Friday evening.

Shalini Jaiswal (22), a housewife living at Beniapukur, died on Thursday at a Salt Lake nursing home after suffering severe burns on November 16. The victimsâ€™ kin complained that she was burnt to death by her husband and in-laws, who were taken into police custody.

A hoard of people came with her body in a convoy of vehicles to the market and ransacked her husband Shekharâ€™s electronics shop.

After this, they attacked other shops and shop owners, too. When the traders retaliated, they fled, leaving a few vehicles and the body on the road.

Angry traders then smashed the vehicles. Police arrived to contain the situation and took the body away.

The traders filed a complaint against Shaliniâ€™s brother Amit Jaiswal, holding him responsible for the incident.

The body of the young woman was handed over to her family on Friday after post-mortem and the miscreants arrived with the body around 7 pm. â€œThey immediately started abusing people and ransacking the shops. They snatched cash boxes and created a pandemonium,â€� said president of Central Kolkata Fans & Electronic Dealersâ€™ Association Shambhunath Jaiswal.

The husbandâ€™s shop, Shekhar Enterprises, was the prime target. Eyewitnesses say the miscreants were drunk and had come in two Tata Sumos, two Matadors and some motorcycles.

â€œThey attacked S.K. Trader, followed by Roy Electronics and then Nagendra Roy Traders,â€� said Shambhunath. â€œThey also tried to set ablaze Shekhar''s shop,â€� he added, alleging that the miscreants were armed.

Earlier, Shekhar claimed that his wife had been injured when a stove burst on Monday at their house on Rameshwar Sau Road. But following Amitâ€™s complaint, the Beniapukur police arrested Shekhar and his elderly parents Rajendra Prasad and Uma Devi.

Shaliniâ€™s father Shankar Prasad Sahu alleged that he had given whatever her daughterâ€™s in-laws demanded as dowry. Shalini, in 2000, had a two-year-old son. Sahu told police that a few months after marriage, Shekhar had demanded Rs 50,000 and again a lakh which he was forced to cough up.
