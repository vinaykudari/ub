0,"Overlooking election code, police draft own rules","lucknow: the police station incharges in the state capital seem to have adopted 'novel' standards of policing seemingly overlooking the code of conduct which has come into force after the announcement of the assembly elections. while the bazarkhala police set free a murder-attempt accused who was named in the fir by the victim, the itaunja police not only turned a blind's eye to the woes of a housewife but also allegedly shooed her out when she had gone to lodge an fir. a resident of zamin building, ubaid ali, was allegedly assaulted and an attempt was made on his life on january 9. an fir was lodged under sections 507/504 in which rashid and yusuf of chadahi mau lal locality along with one of their unidentified associates were named as accused. barely two hours after the incident, police picked up yusuf and detained him at bazarkhala police station. but instead of being produced before the court he was allegedly set free on friday afternoon. the bazarkhala police said that yusuf was released as he was found not guilty. a step ahead of the bazarkhala police seems to be their itaunja counterparts who had refused to register an fir on the complaint of kanchan lata of mahona village. on december 24, three residents had allegedly barged into her house, assaulted the family members and then ransacked the house. after collecting whatever gold and silver jewellery they could they left with a threat to everyone not to report the matter to the police. with the help of some local residents, kanchan made it to the police station the next day to lodge an fir. police station incharge allegedly demanded money to register the case and when kanchan expressed her inability to meet his demand, she was shown the doors. the victim had since then approached many a senior officials but to no avail. neither incharge of itaunja police station nor superintendent of police (sp) rural areas, were available when contacted for comments on the issue on friday.

2,"BJP rule ruined UP, says Milli Council leader","lucknow: the five-year rule of the bharatiya janata party (bjp) has virtually ruined uttar pradesh. among other things, it wrecked the state financially and socially. releasing a 15-page white paper on the bjp government's performance in the state, zafaryab jilani of the all india milli council, prempati of janwadi mehanatkash manch and sanjay rai of insaf on sunday drew the people's attention to the government's failure on all fronts. jilani said the milli council had constituted a five-member committee with himself, mauje khan, md rehman, maulana gulzar and anees saheb to chalk out a political course for the council members. the role of the council members would be crucial in mobilising people against this government, said jilani. the white paper slammed the government for perpetrating atrocities on dalits and killing innocent people in fake encounters. it said that uttar pradesh topped the list of crime against scheduled castes in the country. quoting reports of the national crime records bureau of uttar pradesh, it said that the crime percentage against dalits had gone up to 25.4 in the state in comparison to rajasthan's 21.8, madhya pradesh's 15.8, gujarat's 7.3, andhra pradesh's 6.3, tamil nadu's 6.1 and karnataka's 4.5. the milli council leader said that former chief minister kalyan singh had, during his regime, diluted the harijan act. this emboldened those perpetrating crime against dalits in great measure, said the white paper. jilani said that the bjp's decision to give reservation within reservation was merely a ploy to win dalit support during elections. he said that the bjp had also suspended the centre's special component plan meant for dalits. he said the plan was revived only after concerted efforts made by the governors' committee and subsequently the presidential intervention. the white paper pointed out how the police had stepped up surveillance against muslims and sikhs in the name of checking activities of the inter services intelligence od pakistan. this was done even before the prevention of terrorism ordinance had come into force, said jilani. on the economic front, the white paper pointed out how the state's gross domestic production had plummeted to the bottom during the bjp's regime and the deficit had gone up rs 77,066 crore. the deficit is expected to reach up to rs 85,598 crore in the current financial year, the white paper said. prempati and sanjay rai also vowed to work for exposing the misdeeds of the bjp.

5,Fall in income apprehended,"patna: shifting of the railway-goods shed from the rajendra nagar railway yard here to fatuha coupled with the no-entry bar in day hours on trucks carrying perishable goods to the musallahpur bazar samiti yard has severely affected its business activities. the latest trend is the rise in price of onion brought from nasik and malmad by rail. the price of onion suddenly increased due to shifting of the railway-goods shed to fatuha about eight months back, said secretary of the bazar samiti n k sinha. the price of other perishable goods, too, has been affected due to no-entry bar on vehicles during the day. the goods-train rakes carrying onions now reach fatuha railway-goods shed, while the traders are forced to bring onion in light commercial vehicles from fatuha to the musallahapur yard. the extra cost incurred on carrying onion from fatuha to patna has increased its price, he said. in january last year, the cost of onion in the musallahpur yard ranged from rs 240 to rs 350 per quintal. at present, its price in the yard is from rs 500 to rs 700 per quintal, the official said. sinha apprehended a fall in the bazar samiti's income in the current financial year, while it charges one per cent tax on proceeds of the yard, and its income in the last financial year was rs 1.56 crore. ""in the current financial year, this figure may not be achieved as till december the gross income was about rs 1 crore,"" sinha added. he alleged police high-handedness in stopping the heavy vehicles carrying perishable goods like fruits, onions, and fishes from 5 am to 10 pm. the no-entry time is 7 am to 9 pm. the problem aggravates during the peak of summer when 20 to 50 per cent of such goods perish when left on roads for 24 hours due to strict enforcement of the no-entry bar, said general secretary of fruit merchants' association in musallahpur yrard mohammad moin alam. he claimed that the patna high court, in an order, had authorised the patna district magistrate to use his discretion in allowing vehicles carrying perishable goods to the musallahpur yard. but the dm did not comply, he added. alam charged the musallahpur yard officials with not maintaining good sanitation in the yard, neglecting streetlighting, water supply, repair of shops and fence (earlier broken by some local people). here is no permanent bank branch, only an extension counter of state bank of india, and traders are forced to move to banks outside the yard where there is threat from anti-social elements, alam said, adding that some traders were earlier looted. the bazar samiti officials, however, claimed that whitewashing of the shops is done and the boundary wall would be reconstructed, while the samiti was prepared to construct road from the yard to the kumhrar railway crossing for entry of trucks into the yard during day hours. ""for this, however, the state must provide land,"" he added. (ravitoi@indiatimes.com)

""we are not averse to the idea of contesting elections under lotus symbol. but we want tickets for our candidates from at least six seats where we are comfortably placed,"" state akali dal chief harbhajan singh cheema told pti. he said kashipur and jaspur in udhamsingh nagar district, laldhang and luxor in hardwar district and doiwala and luxman chowk in dehradun district are sikh dominated seats and the party could win from these. cheema said central leadership of akali dal and bjp were holding consultations and an assurance about adjusting dal canhas been given by bjp leadership. earlier, state bjp chief puran chand sharma had announced that his party would go alone on all the 70 assembly seats and ruled out any alliance with the akali dal.

8,"I am still in politics, says Govindacharya","new delhi: sidelined bjp leader k n govindacharya on monday blamed ""communication gap"" for his reported removal as pracharak of the rss and maintained he continues to be in politics. ""it happened all because of a communication gap and not because of any controversy"", govindacharya, who just completed a six-month solitude as part of his two-year sabbatical, told reporters here. denying that the bjp and rss leadership were ""upset"" with him, he said that he continued to be in politics and was an rss swayamsevak (volunteer). ""my ideological moorings are as intense as ever and i will continue my contributory role"", he said adding that since the period of solitude was over, he would now be attending the bjp's national executive. the bjp ideologue said he has no plans to meet prime minister atal bihari vajpayee or home minister l k advani during his brief stay in the capital. govindacharya said that it was for the bjp leadership to decide how to utilise his services once he returned from his study leave. he said he would present his report to the party president on completion of his sabbatical. seeking to close the controversy involving him and sports minister uma bharati, he said, ""i despise such controversies. i regard and respect her as a sant and she is nothing more than a friend."" in august last year, govindacharya, upset over media reports that he secretly married bharati in july, had blamed ""vested interests and status quoists"" for spreading such unfounded reports. he said that since 1992 attempts have been made repeatedly to link his name with uma bharati to put her to shame. it was beyond his comprehension why a chapter, which had been closed ten years ago, was being sought to be reopened again and again. ""such controversies are aimed at discouraging efforts of women for a rightful share in public life,"" he regretted. govindacharya admitted that he wanted to marry uma bharati in 1991 and sent a proposal to her and her family through a senior bjp leader but she turned it down. thereafter, she took sanyaas and the matter ended there.

15,Barauni Dairy buys milk cheap from farmers,"begusarai: barauni dairy, set up here decades ago by the bihar state cooperative milk producers federation (compfed), is proving to be of little help to around 45,000 milk farmers spread over begusarai, khagaria and parts of patna and samastipur districts, on account of the low price being paid by it them. however, milk farmers have no option but to sell their milk to barauni dairy at a throwaway price as they are unable to preserve and process it into different milk products for better and profitable prices. according to sources, the dairy, through its various cooperative societies formed at the village level, buys milk at between rs 7 and 8 per litre from the farmers. according to farmers, the price being paid to them is unremunerative, being less than the cost of production. ""but i am unable to change my business as it has been adopted traditionally by my family based solely on agriculture,"" said rama kant singh, ex-mukhiya and a prominent milk producer of babhangama village under the barauni block. ""barauni dairy is prospering at the cost of milk farmers,"" said senior samata party leader and inhabitant of manjhaul village. according to him, if barauni dairy does not adopt a pro-milk farmers policy, the latter will be forced to give up their vocation for some other profitable one. he asks, ""what is the rationale of selling milk at rs 7 per litre when mineral water is being sold at rs 12 per litre."" he also demanded that the dairy management must explain why does it sell milk at rs 14 per litre which it buys at rs 7 from farmers. according to sources, milk farmers are also being exploited in other ways by various milk cooperative societies formed at the village level. ""five litres of milk is measured as four-and-a-half litres at the village milk booth,"" said jitendra prasad singh of village fajilpur under the birpur police station. he said booth operators refuse to buy milk when proper measurement is demanded. ""on account of losses suffered continuously for the last two years, i sold my two cows and am trying to sell the remaining three also,"" said awadhesh singh, a milk farmer of village binodpur under the begusarai block. similar is the comment of an ips officer and resident of village birpur, umesh kumar singh, who still has 10 cows at his village. he says that he suffers a loss of rs 5,000 per month on account of the low price being paid for milk and costly inputs like labour, fodder and veterinary medicines. conceding that farmers should be paid a higher price for the milk, barauni dairy managing director dr b r manubansh, speaking at a press conference on thursday, said that the dairy was paying the maximum possible price of milk, facing as it does the adverse impact of wto and global market policy adopted by the country. he said that the barauni dairy has been able to withstand the adverse impact of global market policy by registering a growth of around 30 per cent in milk collection, 32 per cent in marketing, 16 per cent in fodder sale and 8 per cent in annual turnover. the md said that there are plans to invest around rs 3 crore in the coming year to set up a dairy plant at purnia, a chilling plant at khagaria and 10 milk coolers at lakhisarai, khagaria and begusarai. he, however, evaded the question as to what relief he is going to give to the farmers when the dairy has been able to make a net profit of rs 1 crore in this year.
