2,Common prospectus for govt colleges available on Net,"CHANDIGARH: The UT administration has finally come up with the bulky 56 page common prospectus for all the four government colleges in the city. Currently available only on the administrationâ€™s official website, â€˜www.chandigarh.nic.inâ€™, the application forms can be downloaded from the site by clicking at the â€˜whatâ€™s newâ€™ window.

The applicants can then apply in the colleges of their choice along with a draft of Rs 50 in the name of the principal of the respective college. However, the inability of the administration to take a final decision on the fee structure of the government colleges is still delaying the actual printing of prospectus.

Sources say that DPI colleges wanted to make the fee structure a part of the prospectus this year. But the delay in taking a final decision has slowed things up. Queries had been pouring in asking about the availability of the admission forms, and putting the prospectus on the Internet along with the admission forms is considered an appropriate step.

â€˜â€˜The decision on the fee issue is likely to be finalised at the end of the week. Printed copies of prospectus should also be available within the week. Till then the online forms should come handy for the applicants,â€™â€™ remarked DPI college Dilip Kumar.

In all 26,000 copies of prospectus would be printed and then distributed to different colleges, which is 5,000 copies more than that of last year. The addition of online availability of application forms would pump in more numbers for applicants. The admissions at all the colleges begin from July 1.

The admission schedule for GCM, Sector 11, GCG, Sector 42 and GC, Sector 46, is same while for GCG, Sector 11 is slightly different because of the high cut-off merit for humanities and commerce section.

Though with the common prospectus colleges have already started the process of accepting the application forms after their availability on the Internet, the last date of receipt of application forms has been left to the individual colleges to decide.

3,CPI demands judicial probe into clash,"CHANDIGARH: Punjab CPI has demanded a judicial inquiry into the Talhan clash saying that the police and civil administration had miserably failed to gauge the situation and take appropriate measures to resolve the dispute and maintain law and order.

Addressing a press conference here on Monday, CPI state secretary Joginder Dayal blamed chief minister Amarinder Singh for his â€˜causalâ€™ attitude and laxity towards the clash.

He said Amarinder Singh went to Jalandhar only when the party chief, Sonia Gandhi directed him and then too he avoided going to Talhan village, Buta Mandi locality and the hospital where the victims of police firing were admitted. â€˜â€˜Amarinder Singh only went to PAP complex and addressed a press conference,â€™â€™ said Dayal suggesting how a serious issue having farreaching ramifications for the state was dealt with so lightly. Commenting on the fivemember committee of cabinet ministers, Dayal said that four ministers belonged to Jalandhar and were a part of the problem.

A couple of them were not even on talking terms, he said. Dayal alleged that the infighting in the Congress had precipitated the crisis to the present brink of disaster. He also raised serious objections on permission granted to Mohkam Singh of Damdami Taksal to visit the village and his statement that the Dalits can be inducted in the management if they become â€˜â€˜Amritdhari (baptised)â€™â€™, which he considered move to further communalise the issue.

Expressing shock and dismay on his entry to the village, Dayal said though the committee members had not entered the village on the pretext of curfew, an outsider Mohkam Singh entered Talhan and stayed there hours and subsequently arranged a press conference. Mohkam Singhâ€™s entry clearly suggests the governmentâ€™s biased approach and involvement in working against Dalits and their interests, he alleged.

The CPI leader, who along with a party MP has visited Talhan, Buta Mandi and civil hospital, said that both the communities had lost faith in the present district administration (infact, the police top brass and some officers of civil administration were shifted on Monday evening). He said the government had taken no preventive action, though the tension had been building for long and once the situation flared up, the government used excessive force and unprovoked firing.

5,More arrests likely over farmers' loans,"BATHINDA: Despite the mounting tension between the members of Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU-Ekta) and authorities of primary agriculture development banks (PADB) of Mansa and Bathinda, the Punjab cooperative department is in no mood of slowing down the loan recovery process.

Nearly two dozen farmers have been arrested in the past ten days for having failed to return bank loans. The Nathana police in Bathinda on Monday booked five BKU leaders along with 20 others on the charge of detaining a PADB deputy manager of Nathana for over two hours at Lehrakhana village where he had gone to make a loan recovery. A BKU delegation also met the deputy commissioner of Bathinda on Monday and warned the district administration that they would go on indefinite dharna in front of the PADB, Bathinda, starting June 13 if the arrested farmers were not released soon.

What could lead to more tension in the region is that the PADB has already procured arrest warrants for 46, 42, 19, 3 and 70 farmers in Bathinda, Raman Mandi, Talwandi Sabo, Nathana and Rampura Phool for defaulting on loan payments. Sources told Times News Network that about 70 defaulting farmers, some of them including Akali and BKU leaders, would arrested in Bathinda and Mansa this week for failing to return bank loans. The PADB authorities forwarded a proposal to the assistant registrar of cooperative societies seeking arrest warrants.

With the panchayat elections round the corner, the SAD(B) leaders are likely to cash in on the misery of the arrested farmers electoral gains. The authorities have adopted a tougher posture, sources in the PADB said as the loan recovery has been poor over the last three years in Ferozepur division which includes Bathinda, Mansa, Faridkot, Moga, Muktsar and Ferozepur districts.

While the government is aiming at recovering up to 70 per cent of the advanced PADB loans, so far only 28 per cent of the Rs 41.50 crore have been recovered in Bathinda. Mansa district, Rs 26 crore have been recovered, said sources. Loan recovery was the poorest in Malwa division where farmers have been facing tough economic conditions for the last five years. If the PADB bank recovery was 90 per cent in 1993 in Ferozepur division, in the years follow the recovery amount dwindled on account of bad cotton crops and. The percentage of recovery plummeted to 66.3 per cent 2001-2002.

The state public relations department (PRD) release on Monday stressed that the CM had reiterated her government''s commitment to the development of the state. ""The proper use and management of fertile agricultural land, adequate water resources and hard working people could give the state a new direction towards development,"" she said.

She said that despite lack of resources after the bifurcation of Bihar, her government had maintained the pace of development in the state. Through proper utilisation of limited resources, control over productivity and increase in revenue collection, the annual plan outlay for the financial year 2002-03 was Rs 2964 crore, which is Rs 329 crore more than the allotment in the last financial year.

She expressed confidence that new industries would be set up in the state and it would create new job avenues as a result of which the living standard of people would go up. She stressed that her government is giving priority to these areas and also laid stress on education, public health and drinking water facilities.

The CM, however, again sought to push the blame on the Centre. She recalled that the state government had sent proposals to the tune of Rs 40,000 crore to the Centre.

He was talking to newspersons here on Monday. With this, he said, the government had solved this four-month-long issue but there were some people, who did not want it to be solved and so they created this trouble. Indicating politics behind this episode, the chief minister said that spoiling the social fabric of society should not be the aim of politics.

He said that he would not allow the game of casteism and communalism in the state. When asked his reaction on the statement of Akal Takht jathedar Giani Joginder Singh Vedanti that he could be summoned at the Takht Sahib regarding the Nanakshahi calendar issue, the chief minister said that it was not a proper way to summon him at the Takht Sahib because his government would not follow the directions of the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC).

He said that this matter was a concern of the Central government and the state government would follow the calendar of the Union government. He said that the SGPC should approach the Central government to get the clearance.

The chief minister said that following the Nanakshahi calendar would not be favourable for the people of the state, as they would be celebrating religious events on different days than those living in other states. Commenting on the Akal Takhtâ€™s declaration, which declared Sant Jarnail Singh Bhindrawale as martyr, Amarinder Singh said that it was not even an issue and set it aside saying that it was a 19-year-old story.

On Jalandhar IG SK Sharmaâ€™s foreign trip, which is being termed as an official one undertaken to probe former chief ministerâ€™s Parkash Singh Badalâ€™s property, the chief minister said the IG had gone abroad on a private tour and that he had not been briefed in this regard.

On the status of migrants settling in Punjab, he said that legally no person could be stopped from living in any state of the country. He said that Himachal Pradesh and Rajasthan did not allow purchase of land by migrants, which was against the law and spirit of the countryâ€™s Constitution, against which he had raised his voice recently in the meeting of Congress chief ministers in Jammu and Kashmir.

He said that only Jammu and Kashmir had been given special status in this matter. Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh at the inauguration of the mini secretariat at Patiala, on Monday.

10,Plan panel letter creates flutter in govt circles,"PATNA: A letter sent by the Planning Commission to the state government has caused a flutter in the state government circles, and chief minister Rabri Devi has been left defending the achievements of her government.

The letter sent to development commissioner M N Prasad earlier this month has left a question mark on the special assistance to be approved by the Planning Commission, which is considering proposals to the tune of Rs 40,000 crore. The letter of the Commission has been referred to the road construction department.

Interestingly, the Planning Commission has referred to the law and order problems in the state, as it has led to difficulties in the implementation of the schemes. ""Due to slack law and order, many unwanted elements have taken over development works.

There is no environment conducive to real, free and competitive tendering. Interference by anti-social elements makes proper execution difficult. Because of continued administrative and law and order problems, the system has become almost non-functional. There is no interest left among the functionaries of implementing agencies and their morale is very low. Remedial measures need to be taken to improve the situation,"" the Planning Commission has observed.

The Commission has pointed to considerable delay made in deciding on tenders, which hamper speedy execution of work, and has asked for streamlining and more delegation of powers down the line to cut short time for the award of contract. It has also suggested that procurement of road construction material should be left entirely to contractors.

The Commission has pointed to virtually non-existent quality control mechanism in Bihar and has stressed that testing facilities needed to be set up in every division, apart from insisting on mechanised construction of roads for better quality.

It has noted that well-equipped and competent contractors with large size packages be selected for road construction.

""At present, small contractors with limited capacity, financial and other resources are executing works, which are essentially of small size,"" it observed.

It has also strongly suggested institutional and procedural reforms to be carried out to minimise interference of functionaries in view of increasing role being given to contractors.

17,Russian foreign minister to visit Delhi this week,"NEW DELHI: India and Russia will be exchanging notes on measures to fight terrorism during the forthcoming visit here of Russian foreign minister Igor Ivanov.

Ivanov will be here over the week-end and will hold talks with his Indian counterpart, Yashwant Sinha.

Announcing this on Tuesday, an external affairs ministry spokesperson indicated that Ivanov may meet Prime Minister Vajpayee.

Resumption of insurgency in Chechnya, that draws its muscle from the al-Qaeda, and the Taliban network regrouping on the Pakistan-Afghanistan border are among the issues on which Ivanov is expected to speak to the Indian side. The Indian and the Russian perceptions on terrorism, be it Kashmir or Chechnya, have a high measure of congruence.

An informal axis of India, Russia and Iran is developing with the common goal of fighting terrorism. At the same time, Ivanov is due to visit Pakistan later this month. In the light of past experiences, it is likely that through him, President Putin may want to set at rest any prior misgivings that India might nurse on the Russo-Pak contact.

Small scale industry is the backbone of the industrial development of the state and the government should see that it comes to no harm, but the small industrialist is facing problems from all fronts making it difficult for him to remain in business.

This was the view expressed by Mohali industrialists of Industrial Focal Point, Phase IX, at a press conference on Tuesday.

IWA president Prabhjot S Sandhu said that the enhancement notices issued by the Punjab Small Scale Industries and Export Corporation (PSIEC) were breaking the backs of most industrialists who had purchased plots from the PSIEC in 1992.

According to Sandhu, the enhancement notices issued by the PSIEC contain highly inflated demands which are much beyond the provisions of Land Acquisition Act.

Giving an example of plots in Phase IX, he said that the plots were originally allotted at Rs 150/sq yard in 1992.

Some plot owners received enhancement notices in October 2002 in which the rate was increased to Rs 625/sq yard. After much representation, the rate was reduced and now it stands at Rs 515/sq yard.

The allottees are at the receiving end as till the settlement of the issue with the PSIEC they cannot raise loans against these plots or expand the industrial units. Even the sale and transfer of these plots is not permitted.

However, the corporation goes on charging interest on the enhancement amount at high rates. Similar was the case with the Punjab Financial Corporation (PFC) which had offered the plot owners a OTSS which is loaded with ifs and buts and is far away from the latest Reserve Bank guidelines as well as the spirit of the stateâ€™s industrial policy.

The IWA further said the PSIEC should take the plot owners into confidence while fixing the enhancement of land rate. IWA vice-president Nirmal Singh said that Mohali was a border town and its industry was being hit due to lower taxes in Chandigarh.

To compound the matter further, recession, easy import of foreign goods, enhanced electricity tariff, octroi, Local Area Development Tax and tax collection at source on scrap was suffocating small industries sector.

24,Absconding judge arrested by CBI,"CHANDIGARH: Absconding judicial magistrate S S Bhardwaj, accused in a corruption case along with another senior judicial officer, was arrested by the Central Bureau of Investigations (CBI) here on Tuesday.

While the CBI said they had arrested Bhardwaj from his hideout at Panchkula in Haryana, the counsel for the accused claimed that he had surrendered at the CBI office here at around 10.05 am.

The counsel claimed that after Bhardwajâ€™s anticipatory bail was dismissed by the Supreme Court on Monday, they contacted CBI''s assistant superintendent of police Surinder Pal on telephone at around 7 am on Tuesday and informed him that Bhardwaj would be surrendering.

Later, they drove down to the CBI office in two private cars for the surrender. Bhardwaj was officially arrested at 11.15 am.

Belying all expectations that Bhardwaj would be taken immediately to the hospital for a medical examination, and later produced in the court for seeking a remand, a battery of reporters and press photographers were kept waiting all day at the CBI office, the district courts and the General Hospital.

Late in the evening, a deputy superintendent of police (DSP) emerged from the CBI office and categorically assured the media persons that they would not produce Bhardwaj in the court on Tuesday.

The media persons, however, stuck to their vigil expecting that Bhardwaj would at least be taken to the hospital for a medical examination.

While the DSP was assuring media persons, court officials were summoned to the official residence of the duty magistrate, reinforcing their suspicion that Bhardwaj might be produced in the court on Tuesday.

Meanwhile, an official news release issued by the CBI in New Delhi said after receiving reliable information that Bhardwaj was staying with a relative in Panchkula, a CBI team had apprehended him.

Bhardwaj was absconding since May 10, after he was caught taking Rs seven lakh bribe from a complainant, G S Samra, for helping him in a bail matter pending before Jalandhar''s district and Sessions judge. The then Jalandhar district and sessions judge R M Gupta was also arrested on May 11. He is in judicial custody till June 12, the release added.

25,"MSU students protest fee hike, disrupt form distribution","VADODARA: Over 1,000 students, queued up at the M S Universityâ€™s faculty of commerce to collect admission forms, had to return home empty-handed on Tuesday, as a group of student activists stalled the proceedings to protest the state governmentâ€™s decision to increase tuition fees.

The M S Universityâ€™s Studentsâ€™ Union (MSUSU) activists arrived at around 8 am to stop the form distribution,which, however, paved the way to a minor stone-throwing incident at the faculty.

Some windowpanes were also broken in the incident. But the student leaders clarified that they had nothing to do with the incident.

â€œWe were in a meeting with the dean when someone threw stones at the windows. In fact, we had no reason to get aggressive, as the dean was supportive of the cause and also the students â€” wanting to collect forms â€” too left the campus without any argument,â€� says MSUSU general secretary Rutvij Joshi.

â€œWe had announced about our plan to stall admission procedure at all the faculties through all newspapers. A poor turnout of students, for collecting forms, at the commerce faculty this time shows that the message was clear.

Every year, during the form distribution, there is a heavy rush with about 8,000 students coming on the very first day. But this time, there were hardly 1,000 students,â€� says MSUSU vice-president Mehul Lakhani.

The students contended that the hike was illogical and would be a burden on the students.

â€œThere is almost 300 per cent hike in fees. We understand there is a need for fee-hike, but it should not be so drastic.

A gradual hike every year is on any day better than taking a single leap,â€� Lakhani says, adding that they would garner support of student leaders across the state to give a joint memorandum to the government.

The students say that no admissions would be allowed till the matter is resolved. â€œWe have approached the vice-chancellor to give a commitment in writing that the university will pursue the matter with the government,â€� Joshi adds.
