2,Lodhama residents protest Rammam hydel project,"DARJEELING: Residents of Lodhama, under the banner of the Jana Kalyan Manch (JKM), have risen in revolt against the WBSEB hydel power project on the Rammam river.

Several local NGOs have also thrown their weight behind them. Earlier, the Teesta Lower Dam project had faced similar protests. The Rammam project includes a 4.7-km tunnel from Mungmung khola, a distributory of the Lodhama river. Lodhama is around 54 km from Darjeeling.

The JKM has threatened to launch an agitation if a survey of the river being carried out by the WBSEB is not stopped within 15 days. â€œThe WBSEB is planning to divert the water of Lodhama river in order to make the four turbines work to meet the needs of increased power generation,â€� said Dipak Lama, executive member of the JKM.

According to him, the project will affect 50,000 acres of land, 21 villages and parts of Sikkim. People will lose their livelihood as Lodhama and its adjoining areas will practically become a desert.

The construction of the plant started way back in 1972 . According to the secretary of Federation of Societies for Environmental Protection Bharat P. Rai, the construction of the plant started when the Environment Protection Act had not been introduced. Moreover, the authorities had assured the local people of employment and compensation.

â€œOut of 500 people who lost their land, only 120 were given compensation. The rest are still waiting for the promised money. After 30 years, they donâ€™t have much hope,â€� he added. Of the four phases, the first phase of the project was completed in 1996. This is perhaps the only power project in the country which is expected to generate more than 23 MW while earning more than Rs 6 lakh per month, Rai said.

â€œWe demand transparency as this project has taken 30 years to complete. Most large projects are completed within eight to nine years. As the project is funded by the World Bank, we can imagine how much the Indian government is paying as interests to the funding agency using public money. There must be some conspiracy,â€� Rai said.

According to environmentalists B.M. Rai of Rimbick, power from the Rammam hydel project goes to north Bengal and Sikkim while the hill people of Darjeeling, especially those of Lodhama, languish in the dark.

4,Govt in dock over political questions in govt exam,"PATNA: â€œThis is what happens when a government loses its moorings,â€� said a citizen on telephone on Sunday, with regard to the two blatantly political questions asked to aspirants in an examination recently.

The anxious callerâ€™s response had come to a news report regarding two questions published in a Hindi daily here on Sunday: â€˜Why is the BJP called a communal party?â€™ and â€˜Describe the achievements of the present chief minister.â€™ The two questions were asked to examiners appearing in a competiton for government job.

The opposition circles said that they would raise the question in the state assembly on Monday and also corner the government on the matter. â€œWe are determined to do it. This government appears to have lost all sense of proportion and balance,â€� said an opposition leader.

The oppositionâ€™s concern notwithstanding, citizens of Patna appeared to be more aggrieved. â€œThe opposition will politicise the matter. But we feel concerned because such things had never been asked to examiners in the past, and should never be asked,â€� the aggrieved citizen said. â€œAfter all, the government employees are not supposed to be political,â€� he added. Whatever the reason behind setting the two questions in the competitive examination for the government job, the trend is not considered to be healthy. â€œWhere are we taking the system,â€� the citizen asked.

The examinees, however, have their own fears, as the newsreport in the Hindi daily has pointed out. For, the total marks that the two questions carry is 50. Examinees are fearing that they will suffer.

5,Closure of crushing units by state govt opposed,"PATNA: Bihar State Stone Crushing Industries Labourers, Employees and Industrialistsâ€™ Sangharsha Morcha has opposed the closure of crushing industries by the state government in the name of pollution, since it has rendered lakhs of people unemployed. They have decided to demonstrate before the chief minister here on Tuesday to ventilate their grievances.

The morcha is of the view that stone crushing industries require less capital while providing more employment opportunities to the people. Such industries require transportation of finished products and in transport industries too a number of people get employment. The closure of such industries has compelled consumers to purchase â€˜gittiâ€™ at higher prices from Jharkhand.

The morcha alleged that the protest voices were suppressed by police firing on peaceful agitationists and implicating them in false cases.

Thousands of trucks were seized by the forest officials in Sasaram, Gaya, Rajauli, Rajgir and Jamalpur. On the plea of increasing, forest cover several leases were cancelled illegally by the state government, it stated.

The morcha has demanded the withdrawal of the closure order with immediate efffect, two yearsâ€™ time to fulfil all the conditions related to pollution, simplification of licensing procedure, stoppage of all sorts of repressive measures against industrialists, labourers, employees and vehicle-owners, withdrawal of false cases against them and unconditional release of all seized vehicles.

6,NC will win even under President's rule: Omar,"SRINAGAR: National Conference President Omar Abdullah on Sunday exuded confidence that his party would win hands down even if the Assembly polls in Jammu and Kashmir are held under President''s rule.

""NC has the unflinching support of the people across the state who are fully aware about the programmes and policies as well as the sacrifices made by the party to secure democratic rights and ensure faster socio-economic development despite many challenges,"" he told well attended public meetings at Paddar, Nagsaini and Dachhan areas in Doda district.

""Even if President''s rule is imposed in the state prior to the polls as demanded by our adversaries, NC will win hands down as it has done in the past,"" he said.

He cautioned the people against falling prey to disgruntled politicians, who have no solid agenda for their welfare but are trying to ""hoodwink"" them by inciting regional and religious sentiments.

Omar said the process of devolution of powers to panchayats has been started so that these grass root-level democratic institutions could discharge their role effectively in the socio-economic transoformation of the rural areas.

Despite constraints, thousands of youth have been given employment during the last six years, he claimed. Efforts would be made to provide government jon to at least one member of each family and for the purpose, rules would be suitably amended to introduce recruitment process at the block-level.

Omar said identity cards were not mandatory for casting votes. It is not possible for the people living in far-flung areas to get these cards when elections were round the corner.

8,Police denies arresting naxal leader,"GUNTUR: Guntur district superintendent of police P S R Anjaneyulu said that police have not picked up any naxalite leader in the last couple of days.

When asked about the allegations made by the civil liberties associations, the SP said that it had been a practice of these organisations to issue false statements whenever a contact with their militants was missed.

He, however, asserted that the encounter on Sunday was not a fake one. Talking to The Times of India, the SP said that Sudhakar of People''s War (PW), a courier between the state committee and the district committee, was killed in an exchange of fire in Uppalapadu village under Veldurthy mandal. The deceased was involved in various crimes in the Guntur district and he was a member of special guerilla squad (SGS).

Sudhakar was one of the accused in a landmine blast case in which seven police personnel and a jeep driver were killed during the local bodies elections last year. The naxalite was also accused in several other murder cases in Guntur and Prakasam districts. Meanwhile, the Communist Party of India (CPI) has blamed the state government for failure of talks with the PW.

9,PW arrests: Shadow of the Seventies?,"KOLKATA: Are the â€œdark days of the 1970sâ€�, of which the ruling Left in West Bengal remind the people quite often, returning?

The fear, strangely, is being shared by both the guardi-ans of the state and their critics. The once-marginalised Naxalites are on the resurgence, claim the police. Like in the turbulent Seventies, they are not only fanning out in the districts, but also attracting fresh blood from the academic circles. A few days ago, an anthropology topper girl was among four arrested Naxalites.

And on Friday, an IIT-alumnus university lecturer figured in another foursome held for alleged Peopleâ€™s War links. Intelligence agencies insist that the lecturer, Kaushik Ganguly, was setting up a subversive network linking Andhra Pradesh, Orissa, Jharkhand, West Bengal and the North-East. Ganguly has been portrayed by the police as an ideologue with links to PW leader Kishan in Andhra Pradesh.

He and his co-accused â€“ Amway salesman Tinku Ghosh, private tutor Parashar Bhattacharya and screen printer Rabindra Mahato â€“ have been charged with waging war against the state. Raids are continuing in the city and the North 24-Parganas, Nadia, Hooghly and Midnapore districts. Many families are getting accustomed to hearing the midnight knock â€“ proverbial in the Seventies.

Ashok Das of Baguiati, heard it at 1.30 am on Friday. Opening the door, he found policemen in battle fatigue. â€œDoes any Brahmin live here?â€� an officer asked. Before Das could comprehend the question, he was asked to identify a phone number. It belonged to his landlord Gopen Ghosh. They took away Ghoshâ€™s son Tinku. His mother was not allowed to see him at the police station before he was sent to Salboni in Midnapore.

Kaushik received two phone calls to confirm that he was home before police picked him up from his Nagerbazar flat. â€œA team led by DSP Mrinal Mazumdar came at midnight. They arrested him without showing us any documents,â€� said his brother Souvik. All the eight youths arrested in these nocturnal swoops later complained in Midnapore court that they were tortured.

Rights activists see the shadow of the Seventies in these events in a different way. They say the Left Front, like the previous Congress regime, is trying to curb dissent through repression. A resolution adopted at a citizensâ€™ convention commemorating 30 years of the Association for Protection of Democratic Rights on Sunday said, â€œThere is a possibility that the situation which existed when the association was founded (1972) might come back.â€�

17,Sethumadhavan included in film festival jury,"NEW DELHI: Well-known Malayalam director K.S. Sethumadhavan has been appointed the new chairman of the combined jury for the 49th National Film Awards and the Indian panorama section of feature films.

Sethumadhavan replaces veteran actor Amol Palekar who has declined to head the jury because of his brief appearance in one of the entries, an Information and Broadcasting Ministry release said on Monday.

Amol Palekar tendered his resignation minutes before it began in New Delhi.

""I have informed the director of the festival Deepa Sandhu that I am opting out. I also told the jury members about the developments. I am sure this move will set a good precedence as the rule clearly says any person connected with the film directly or indirectly will not sit in the jury,"" he said.

""When the directorate officials of the National Film Festival gave me the details of the films which would be screened, I found it also included Aks,"" Palekar said.

""The officials were not aware that I had acted in this film because it was not mentioned in the cast as my role was only for a minute,"" he said.

""However, I felt that though my role in this film was very short, it would not be proper for me to be a member of the jury and judge this film,"" the actor-director said.

""Moreover in the past when such things have happened, I have been very vociferous to air my criticism. Hence to uphold the dignity and sanctity of the national award, I have resigned,"" Palekar added.

Some other jury members -- Manmohan Mohapatra, Rajeswari Sachdeva and Dolly Ahluwalia Tewari -- have also opted out for being directly or indirectly associated with some films to be screened at the festival.

18,Govt serious on law to curb power theft,"VADODARA: Power theft is a major problem affecting the financial position of the Gujarat Electricity Board (GEB). The state government is thinking of enacting a law against power theft to eradicate this menace.Energy minister Kaushik Patel said the government is thinking of promulgating an ordinance on it. Talking to TNN over phone, Patel said pilferage/theft of energy had become rampant in urban as well as rural areas over the years. Huge power thefts are reported from Godhra, Bhavnagar, Jamnagar, Surat and other areas in the state, GEB sources said. About 330 feeders, from where large cases of power pilferage were reported, have been identified. Special squads of GEB have stepped up drive to curb this menace. Andhra Pradesh, perhaps, is the first state to have enacted a law against power theft. The state government wants to follow suit. Further, the government is thinking of amending the existing Indian Electricity Act (1910) suitably, Patel said. In order to conduct speedy trial, it is thinking of setting up special courts and tribunals, and awarding stern punishment to offenders.However, with the power reform Bill introduced in the assembly pending for over a year, in face of strong opposition it seems that the government will need a strong political will to curb this menace.

Kharge seeking a report on the incident from Mysore Police Commissioner Chandrashekar on Monday.

A Mysore police team led by ACP S.D. Ramakrishna, in an attempt to make amends, tried to tender an apology to Srinath, but were led on a wild goose chase by the cricketer. When the team finally tracked him down on his cell phone, Srinath reported told them: ``I am on my way to Bangalore and cannot meet you. Anyway, it was not a big enough issue to offer an apology.''''

Kharge, meanwhile, told reporters in Bangalore that as soon as the Commissioner''s report came in, he would take action against the concerned police official, Rajendra Prasad. ``I will act as per the recommendation in the report,'''' he stated.

Prasad reportedly made Srinath stand and refused to take a complaint after he misplaced his car''s RC book. He allegedly insisted that Srinath should get a notary to certify his identity before the complaint could be registered.

24,SC moved on Bhayandar polls,"MUMBAI: Mira Bhayandar senior citizens association and a few other voters moved the supreme court on Monday to challenge a July 3 Bombay high court order refusing interim relief against holding civic elections for Mira-Bhayandar Municipal Corporation on Aug. 11. About 1.5 lakh votersâ€™ names do not figure on the electoral rolls. Advocate Shreepad Murthy who appeared for the senior citizensâ€™ association had informed the high court that an anomalous situation had occurred in the Mira-Bhayandar civic jurisdiction as the delimitation of ward boundaries was based on 1991 census figures while the population had risen drastically in some areas. In the high court, the petition had challenged the elections and had called for a fresh electoral roll to be used. The high court, however, had observed that interim relief need not be granted to the voters. But explaining the disparity in the delimitation of ward boundaries, Mr Murthy said, in Mira Road (east) there are six electoral constituencies (corporators) for a population of 1.39 lakhs whereas in Bhayandar (west) there were 37 corporatorsâ€™ constituencies for a population of 1.4 lakhs. Mr Murthy said the anomaly arose as the demarcation of wards was based on the 1991 census which pegged the Mira Road (east) population at 13,000. He said that on the basis of the present population there ought to be at least 20 constituencies. The special leave petition (SLP) before the apex court is on the grounds that the high court has not considered the submission that for charting out territorial ward boundaries the latest census or provisional census figures must be relied upon. The SLP is likely to be heard on Tuesday. Muzzafar Hussain, president of Maharashtra Pradesh Youth Congress from Mira Road said the Election Commission was supposed to publish a final electoral list on July 5, but had postponed it to August 19. He said genuine voters who have been residing in Mira-Bhayandar for years are being deprived of their right to vote.The irony is that the former Mira-Bhayandar municipal council was converted into a corporation this February due to a rise in population, but now half the voters will not be able to exercise their franchise.
