2,Dalmias may acquire 40% stake in Revathi equipment,"new delhi: a h dalmia's renaissance group is understood to be keen on acquiring majority equity stake in coimbatore-based revathi equipment limited (rel) and has submitted a bid to rel's swedish parent atlas copco. the delhi-based renaissance, which shot into fame with the aborted acquisition bid for mumbai-based company gesco corporation earlier this year, is believed to have placed a bid for the entire 40 per cent stake of atlas copco (formerly chicago pneumatics) in revathi, industry sources said here on sunday. when contacted, renaissance director abhishek dalmia declined to comment on the issue. also, atlas copco officials were not immediately available for comments since they were abroad. atlas copco holds 30 per cent stake in revathi directly and another 10 per cent via its other indian subsidiary atlas copco india; revathi is believed to be valued at about rs.100 crore. as per the takeover code of the securities and exchange board of india (sebi), in case renaissance acquires 40 per cent stake in revathi, it will necessarily have to make an open offer to revathi's public shareholders to acquire another 20 per cent stake, thus taking its stake up to 60 per cent, sources added. according to the sources, atlas copco mandated investment banker merill lynch to find a suitable buyer for revathi as far back as september 2000 and dalmias' is the only bid being considered as of now. revathi manufactures blast hole rings used in drilling open cast mines. it also makes waterwell drilling rigs for drilling borewell and exploration of ground water resources. according to sources, atlas copco is keen to exit this business of drills in india, since it does not manufacture this product anywhere else across its worldwide operations. during 1999-2000, sales turnover of revathi fell 13 per cent to rs 60.1 crore from rs 65.2 crore in the same period of the previous year. revathi was incorporated as a private company in may 1977 and went public in november of the same year. sources said the proposed acquisition deal is likely to be finalised over the next few months.

""das has been arrested by the uttar pradesh police twice,"" a cid officer said. several suspected persons from mumbai and hyderabad have stayed at the salt lake ashram of the organisation during the past two months. in 1998, the u.p. police charged das in four rape cases. the organisation has units in mumbai, hyderabad, bangalore and several places in andhra pradesh. ""das founded our organisation in 1987 after he left his job in the marine,"" said a member. meanwhile, the sleuths of city police sat up after the owner of another well-known shoe company in the city received an extortion demand over the phone on friday. a few other middle-level businessmen had also received threat calls, kolkata police detective department sources said. ""the atmosphere is so tense after the roy burman's abduction that any body can make extortion call with an expectation of some success,"" a senior city police officer said.

15,'Romeo' pays a heavy price for flirting with law,"ahmedabad: eighteen-year-old anand khatik paid a heavy price for flirting with the law, literally. the teenager had called up the 100 police emergency number and started flirting with the women operators at the control room on may 20. he obviously was not aware that the control room had the caller-id system through which they found out that the call had been made from a pco booth at amraiwadi. having identified that khatik made the call, they went to his residence but he ran away before he could be arrested. on friday, the amraiwadi came to know of his whereabouts and arrested him. woman murdered: fifty-year-old aminabibi ghanchi died in civil hospital in ahmedabad on friday after being attacked by miscreants on august 6. it all began on april 4 when ghanchi had gone to see the film 'gadar' with her relatives, including 16-year-old ilyas and his mother khatunbibi. during the film ilyas started whistling prompted by others in the audience. this irritated one suresh thakore, sitting next to him. suresh beat up ilyas. on august 6, ilyas, with his mother and other went to thakore's house to complain about the incident when the two groups, brandishing metal pipes and swords, clashed, in which aminabibi and two others were badly injured. after initially registering a case of attempted murder, the police have now registered a case of murder against thakore and his accomplices. opium confiscated: the narcotics control, gujarat confiscated 18 kg of opium, worth rs 45 lakh, from two rajasthan-based farmers in ahmedabad on friday. based on a tip-off that gopalsingh anjani and narsinh rathod, two opium farmers, were coming to ahmedabad from palanpur in a maruti car, the bureau officials intercepted it at indira bridge at 12.30 pm and recovered the opium. according to superintendent of police in charge of the economic offences cell with additional responsibility of the narcotics bureau s g bhati, it is quite likely that the opium was meant for banaskantha where it is consumed in large numbers. as the two may not have found enough takers, it is believed that they were trying to sell it in ahmedabad.

16,Gas Act lies at anchor; $2.5 bn investments held up,"gandhinagar: for all the hullabaloo surrounding the gas act and the state government's urgency in obtaining a clearance for the act six months ago, the government has failed to get the implementation process started. and, the result has been disastrous: around $2.5 billion investment expected for several liquefied natural gas terminals along gujarat's coastline is at stake. the hold-up is because of the centre's delay in deciding whether gujarat should be given complete rights over transmission and distribution (t&d) of gas on state territory, as stipulated in the act. also hanging fire is the plan to build a 2,500-km gas grid at the cost of rs 3,000 crore. the act was first brought as an ordinance in december 2000, much to governor s s bhandari's initial resistance. state energy minister kaushik patel on saturday told 'the times of india': ""chief minister keshubhai patel has pleaded -- both orally and in writing -- with union petroleum minister ram naik to clear the matter once and for all."" yet, kaushik said, the centre is bent on taking ""either a presidential reference on the issue of jurisdiction, or even approach the supreme court for advice. this despite the fact that the act was passed in february in the state assembly after taking legal opinion from senior supreme court advocate fali nariman and the advocate-general of gujarat."" the main ""legal hitch"" in the state's failure to implement the act, according to kaushik, relates to the gujarat governor's ""clear-cut direction to the state government not to implement the act till it was cleared by the centre"". bhandari did not sign the act after it was passed in february for three months. and when he signed it on the cm's insistence, he made it conditional to centre's approval on the issue of jurisdiction. officials here consider this ""unprecedented for a state governor to put a conditional approval of an act"". officials say the centre is now going all out to subvert the state's gas act by coming up with its own act to regulate transmission and distribution of lng. ""it is at the draft stage,"" said an official. ""one does not know what it will contain and how much time it will take; nor does one know when it will be placed in the union cabinet for approval, not to talk of placing it before parliament. this has complicated things further for those wanting to invest in the state for lng terminals, particularly for shell at hazira and british gas at pipavav."" indeed, gujarat's plan to make the state a gateway for transmission and distribution of lng itself is in jeopardy. the act clearly provides for setting up a gas commissionerate responsible for signing up concessional agreements with foreign and indian parties wanting to invest in lng and monitoring its orderly distribution in a regulated manner. it also stipulates setting up a gas regulatory authority that would look into tariff issues for transmission and distribution as also evolving efficiency standards. no steps have been taken in either direction, not to talk of setting up the gas grid. the reason why the centre is resisting gujarat's effort is, according to state government sources, the union petroleum ministry's the that the gas authority of india ltd will lose its monopoly over a matter that is allegedly under state jurisdiction. at present, gail charges as high as rs 1.20 per metre cube supplied to gujarat through the hazira-bijapur-jagdishpur pipeline controlled by it. officials say a state gas regulatory authority might put into question the tariff, which in actuality should be ""distance-based"". which means, it would be about 30 to 40 paise. the centre fears that if the gas act is allowed to operate in gujarat, the gail's profits could be hit badly. also, other states could come up with similar transmission and distribution laws, hitting at the gail even further. already, there is a lot of confusion over gas distribution in gujarat. gujarat gas distributes gas in surat and ankleshwar. and, there are other players, including reliance, adani, hindustan oil exploration company, who are waiting in the wings for rights to industrial centres. without the act being implemented, gas distribution would become haphazard. investments of around $2.5 billion, for setting up liquefied natural gas terminals along gujarat's coastline, are at stake; all because of the centre's delay in adjudging whether gujarat should be given complete gas t&d rights on state territory, as stipulated in the act
