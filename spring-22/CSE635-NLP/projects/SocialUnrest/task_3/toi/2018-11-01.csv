0,Haryana auction policy a goldmine,"chandigarh: the haryana government's decision to auction mines has paid off richly.the auction of seven mines in faridabad district yielded rs 16.39 crore while that of another 12 in gurgaon district fetched rs 7.51 crore. disclosing this here on wednesday, an official spokesman said the reserve price of 12 mines auctioned gurgaon district, on wednesday, had been fixed at rs 4.55 crore and that in faridabad at rs 10.50 crore. the state cabinet recently decided to frame a policy for public auction of mining leases for minor minerals. it was felt that the open auction system was more transparent as compared to the earlier system of inviting applications and holding interviews for allotment of mining rights. the new system would also check leakage of revenue as there would be a minimum guaranteed income in the form of annual dead rent, determined on the basis of auction. the decision was taken on the basis of recommendations made by the task force. the committee had considered the recommendations of the task force. it was suggested that the lease of all unallotted, prematurely terminated, expired or likely to expire areas in the districts of faridabad, gurgaon, and the potential areas of the districts of rewari and mahendergarh may be granted by open auction for minor minerals only.

1,Former MP appeals to govt to procure paddy from farmers,"vijayawada: former member of rajya sabha and farmer leader yelamanchili sivaji appealed to the state government to avail of food credit from the reserve bank of india (rbi) to procure paddy at the minimum support price through various state government agencies. addressing a press conference here on tuesday, he said the rbi has earmarked rs 44,000 crore to be distributed to various states as food credit for the procurement of foodgrains. sivaji, who toured punjab and haryana recently, wanted the state government to emulate these two states in procurement of paddy from the farmers. he said the punjab government had availed of rs 6,318 crore food credit from the rbi and spent the sum on procurement of paddy from farmers.the amount was later reimbursed by the fci, he added. sivaji urged chief minister n chandrababu naidu to use his good offices with the government of india to ensure that the fci purchased paddy from the farmers and not just rice from the millers. he said the fci had declined to buy paddy from the farmers directly and suggested that it would procure only rice from the millers. this would help the millers and harm the interests of the farmers, he pointed out. sivaji said specifications with regard to paddy procurement should be relaxed and the fci asked to buy the grains directly from the farmers on a pro rata basis. though the paddy output was expected to be about 80 lakh tonnes in the state this kharif season, only 55 lakh tonnes was likely to be sold in the open market by farmers. premium varieties like sona masoori and samba masoori could be stocked up by the farmers in anticipation of better prices in view of past experiences. referring to the lack of storage space in various godowns, the former mp suggested that unused air strips in places like tadepalligudem, pedavegi (west godavari district) and rajahmundry (east godavari) could be converted into open godowns to stock the procured paddy. several major rice mills in towns like palakol and bhimavaram could also be utilised for the purpose. the state government agencies like the civil supplies department and markfed should gear up to lift more stocks and bail the farmers out, he said.

3,"Shootout at Lodhi Garden, 2 suspected terrorists arrested","new delhi: two suspected terrorists, believed to be planning bomb blasts and assassinations of high profile vips, were arrested by the police after a brief exchange of fire from the parking of lodhi garden on monday night. their alleged woman accomplice was arrested on wednesday. the accused have been identified as arshad khan alias masab ali, asif raza khan alias miraz and anita das. according to police officials, while arshad is a pakistani national, the other two accused are from kolkata. the police claimed to have recovered a pistol, two hand grenades and seven bullets from the accused. joint commissioner of police (crime) k k paul said they had been tipped-off about the plot a few days back. since then the police had been working on the case trying to track down the suspects. ''we learnt that the suspects would be coming to the parking lot of lodhi garden. a trap was laid and they were spotted at about 11.30 pm driving a silver-grey scooter. the vehicle did not have a registration plate. when the police challenged the suspects one of them fired a shot. however, they were overpowered and arrested. the empty cartridge from the fired bullet was also recovered from the spot,'' paul said. further investigations led the police to anita das who was also arrested. though police officers remained tight-lipped about the details of the case, sources said the accused are believed to belong to either jaish-e-mohammed or harkat-ul-jehad-e-islami. they said the accused had been sent to delhi to carry out assassinations of high profile personalities. their presence in the lodhi gardens, said sources, is also significant since many vips went for their morning and evening walks there. ''it is quite possible that the accused would have laid in wait for the morning walkers to arrive and then try and gun them down,'' said the source. sources further pointed out that the spot from where the accused were arrested is not very far from the residence of several important people, including the delhi police commissioner ajai raj sharma. the accused were later produced in a city court. ''while arshad and arif have been remanded to police custody till november 13, anita das has been remanded to police custody for two days,'' paul added. the police suspect the accused to be part of a larger conspiracy. already several teams have been dispatched to various parts of the country to follow up leads. it is also believed that there are other members of the gang present in the city and many of them may be pakistani nationals. ''it is too premature to get into specifics of the case. we are still interrogating the accused and investigations are still in the preliminary stage,'' paul said.

5,Steep drop in domestic air passenger traffic since Sept 11,"mumbai: the total number of domestic air passengers in india dropped by a whopping 90,000 following the terrorist strikes in the u.s. on september 11, aviation sources stated here on wednesday. the sources said the figures relates to passengers carried by indian airlines (ia), jet airways and air sahara. ``this is one of the biggest drops in recent times,'' said an aviation expert. apart from the fear of flying which resulted in a large number of cancellations following the u.s. incident, a slowdown in the economy also caused a steep drop in passenger traffic since september 11. jet airways has reported a 10 per cent drop in the number of passengers it carried in its network. this has had some impact on its profits forcing the airline to effect a 10 per cent wage cut for its managers, pilots and engineers from october. of the total number of 6,300 jet employees, the strength of the managers is 140; pilots 370 and engineers 400. said a top jet executive: ``we have assured them that once the company's financial performance improves we will reimburse the money to them.'' when told that the pilots were upset about the cut, he said: ``i have been talking to them and explained the need to cut wages. while most of them have appreciated the need, there are a few pockets of resistance. i will talk to them.'' asked if the airline has worked out any contingency plan in case the pilots decide to protest, he hoped that they will not agitate. according to an ia spokesperson, after the september 11 incident the combined seat load factor of all domestic operators came down to 53.2 per cent in september as against 57.3 per cent in august.

6,Bhujbal rules out police misconduct in Malegaon,"mumbai: the malegaon riots could not be attributed to any misconduct on the part of the police, the deputy chief minister chhagan bhujbal said on wednesday. mr bhujbal, who holds the home portfolio, said the rioting began on october 26 more than an hour after a skirmish between the srp jawans posted outside the jama masjid in the town and certain muslim activists who were distributing pamphlets calling for boycott of american and british goods like coke and pepsi. mr bhujbal said that according to information that he had, one of the srpf personnel was refused a copy of the pamphlet. there was some argument and the mob got furious. ``they began throwing stones at the police at 2.40 p.m. nothing happened for an hour after that. at 4 p.m., some people took the law into their own hands and went on a rampage, looting shops and setting goods and vehicles on fire.'' after the mob refused to see reason and turned a deaf ear to the repeated warnings, the police lobbed teargas shells, resorted to a lathicharge and eventually opened fire. asked whether he suspected foul play, mr bhujbal was non-committal. a magisterial inquiry would be instituted into the affair once normalcy is restored in the area. the situation in malegaon and neighbouring areas like antapur and wadner is peaceful, mr bhujbal maintained. curfew was lifted for three hours in the morning. ``people thronged the marketplace and there was no incident,'' he said. in view of the encouraging response, curfew may be lifted for a few more hours on thursday, he said. of the 13 persons who lost their lives in the riots, nine were killed in the police firing. an inpector-general of police and a superintendent of police were among the several injured. the police have arrested 638 persons and filed 57 cases so far. this includes 37 cases concerning the first incident alone. replying to a question, mr bhujbal said, ``we don't know whether those arrested belong to any political party.'' the centre has sent the rapid action force and the central industrial security force. they have been deployed along with companies of the srpf at malegaon and other sensitive places like mumbai, thane, jalgaon and nashik as a precautionary measure. all policemen on leave have been called back, mr bhujbal said, indicating that the government was taking no chances. asked whether the deceased would get any compensation, mr bhujbal said there was no such proposal yet. ``giving compensation would amount to saying the police committed a crime,'' he said. governor p.c. alexander has been briefed about the situation, mr bhujbal said and added that the state machinery was on the alert from october 19 when a group of people were seen carrying pictures of osama bin laden and shouting slogans against the u.s. action in afghanistan. asked whether janata dal leader nihal ahmed was leading that procession, mr bhujbal said, ``there was no morcha as such. so there was no question of leading it.'' however, ``because we suspected trouble, we posted the srpf on the spot,'' he added. the 207 people who had been arrested at the time were later freed by the court.

7,"SRPF did not provoke riots, says Malegaon MLA","mumbai: the state reserve police force (srpf) did not provoke the riots at malegaon last friday, local congress mla, shaikh rashid, stated on wednesday. in a telephonic interview, mr rashid (47) said that the srpf personnel posted near the local jama masjid spotted a youth distributing handbills after the afternoon `namaz.' when they questioned the youth about the nature of the handbill, a mob gathered around them. ``a youth who was a part of the mob slapped a constable and generally misbehaved with him. this angered the police but they did not open fire. i and the local leader of the jamat e ulema mufti mohammed ismail pacified the crowd and it dispersed,'' mr rashid said. later a mob gathered near the janata dal (secular) office at piru chowk and started pelting stones. ``the riots took a communal turn with members of both the minority and majority communities looting shops and burning vehicles. firing of tear gas and lathi charge had no effect on the rioters,'' mr rashid stated. he said tension had been building up gradually in the powerloom township a week before the riots when former mla of the area and state president of the janata dal (secular) nihal ahmed led a procession to condemn the u.s. bombing of afghanistan. ``placards of osama bin laden were brandished,'' he stated. mr rashid alleged that the riots had ``nothing to do with osama bin laden, afghanistan or the u.s.'' they were simply the outcome of power politics in the area, he observed. malegaon has always been a stronghold of the janata dal till october, 1999. mr ahmed, who was a votary of secularism all along, represented this constituency, dominated by the minority community, continuously from 1977 to 1999. from 1972 to 1977 it was represented by ayesha hakim of the congress. but for 20 years beginning in 1977, the congress simply could not make any inroads into this backward constituency. in 1999, mr rashid, who runs a transport business, trounced the veteran mla nihal ahmed, who was earlier a leader of the opposition in the legislature, by a margin of about 28,000 in a surprise development. ``during my election campaign i focussed on the total non-performance of mr ahmed in the constituency. i informed the people that he had hardly undertaken any development activity in the constituency. the voters were obviously suffering from the fatigue of voting for mr ahmed again and again and this time they decided to back me. unfortunately, he is still to reconcile to the fact of his humiliating defeat. the riots were an outcome of his efforts to regain his position,'' mr rashid said. he said both the majority and minority communities have lost heavily in the riots. ``the poor, most of whom are daily wage earners, have suffered the maximum for no fault of theirs,'' he said.

8,"BJP, Sena to keep a low profile: Malegaon riots","mumbai: the central bjp leadership has advised its maharashtra unit as well as the shiv sena, an ally in the bjp-led nda government, to maintain a low profile in view of the communal flare-up in malegaon in northern maharashtra, it is learnt. the bjp central leaders are said to be of the view that the opposition sena-bjp alliance in maharashtra should not be now seen as creating a communal divide in the state by whipping up anti-minority sentiments. ``we do not wish to exacerbate the crisis in any part of the state. we have decided to adopt a `wait-and-watch' policy'', a senior bjp functionary told this newspaper on tuesday. echoing similar sentiments, a senior sena leader said, ``the vilasrao deshmukh ministry can be trusted to make matters difficult for itself by its inept handling of the law and order situation. the sena-bjp alliance need do nothing to accentuate the trouble for the state government. we will, of course, criticise the maharashtra government for its limp-wristed policy vis-a-vis the pro-taliban elements''. meanwhile, senior bjp leader gopinath munde and sena leader uddhav thackeray, while addressing a press conference on tuesday, launched a frontal attack on the deshmukh ministry for not taking adequate measures to control the situation in malegaon where, according to preliminary reports, a skirmish between an srpf personnel and a muslim cleric triggered communal trouble last friday. the army is making valiant attempts to restore peace in malegaon. while accusing former janata dal (jd) mla nihal ahmed of fomenting trouble in malegaon, mr munde and mr thackeray criticised the state government for not arresting the controversial jd functionary. prominent language newspapers have been stridently critical of mr ahmed's role in the riots. ``the state government has arrested nearly 70 sena-bjp activists in malegaon, but mr ahmed is moving about freely in the city. by adopting such double standards, the state government has failed to inspire the confidence of the people and to soothe the city's frayed nerves. the government is going soft on mr ahmed because his party, the janata dal, is one of the constituent allies of the ruling democratic front government,'' mr munde said. while leading a morcha of protesters who derided the u.s. attack on afghanistan last friday, mr ahmed was seen flaunting a portrait of osama bin laden, mr munde said. ``yet, the maharashtra government is doing nothing to stop such pro-osama demonstrations. this is reprehensible,'' he added. mr thackeray said the maharashtra government was molley-coddling the likes of mr ahmed as it wanted to keep intact its muslim vote-bank. ``the vilasrao deshmukh ministry should hang osama's portrait in government offices,'' mr uddhav thackeray remarked. mr munde and uddhav lambasted the state government for not permitting political leaders to visit malegaon. ``i spoke with the state dg this morning seeking permission to visit the riot-torn city. but he turned down my request. we were told that congress president sonia gandhi too was not allowed to go to malegaon'', mr munde said. the duo urged the citizens to maintain peace in the state. sena leader raj thackeray, state bjp chief pandurang phundkar, bombay bjp chief vinod tawde and former sena mp madhukar sarpotdar were present at the press conference which marked the second coming of the decade-plus hindutva alliance on the eve of the statewide civic elections. earlier, mr munde and mr thackeray announced the first yield of the seat-sharing talks for the ensuing elections to the local self-governing bodies, including the zilla parishads, the municipal councils and the municipal corporations. under a seat adjustment formula hammered out after three rounds of negotiations, the sena will contest 87 of the 170 seats for the election to the chairmanship of the municipal council. the bjp's tally will be 75 seats. under a new policy of the state government, these elections are to be conducted directly by adult franchise. in eight seats, the sena-bjp alliance will coalesce with local outfits, mr munde said. ``the sena and the bjp will conduct a joint campaign with a common manifesto. leaders of the two parties will jointly tour the state for the civic elections'', he added.

9,Pune varsity inches closer to 5-star status,"pune: the university of pune is in the running for the prestigious five-star norm accorded by the national assessment and accreditation council (naac). if the response of the naac team, which concluded its three-day assessment visit to the university here on wednesday is anything to go by, the varsity will soon join the elite club of institutions like bombay university and sndt. prof. k.l. kamal, head of the six-member naac team, said, ""we are highly impressed by the work culture, attitude, devotion and dedication of everybody in the university and their efforts to work within the limited resources and inadequate staff."" he remarked that the university was an institution of international standard, and could get international accreditation as well. naac, an autonomous body of the university grants commission (ugc) set up four years ago, has the task of assessing the quality of 12,000 colleges, 250 universities and 30 deemed universities in the country and give them rating in stars as per their quality. the naac assessment has been made mandatory by the ugc and its importance lies in the fact that funding by the ugc will be based on the naac accreditation. colleges or universities that do not go in for assessment by naac will receive less money. primarily the team assesses the quality of the faculty and the courses offered by the university. results are expected to be annnounced before diwali. meanwhile, responding to the urgency of the assessment issue, the state government has set up a cell for assessment and accreditation in the ministry of higher education, dr ashok kolaskar, vice chancellor of pune university told reporters today. the aim is to get at least 150 colleges assessed in the next two years before the expiry of the deadline set by the ugc, he clarified. self-study reports of 100 colleges have already been forwarded to the cell. so far, four universities and eight colleges in the state have got naac accreditation.

10,'Tricolour could revive flagging patriotism',"new delhi: his patriotism is tricoloured. navin jindal, businessman with a conscience, has ceased to be just a crusader. he is now converting people to his view that it is the right of every indian to display the national flag. not that 31-year-old jindal wears his flag on his sleeve. now in the seventh year of a battle with the government for his ""freedom of speech and expression"", jindal asserts that the right to fly the flag should come with the commitment that there shall be no disrespect shown. he tries to laugh away the unsavoury incident involving page three regular malini ramani, who made a social appearance draped in the indian flag. if not offensively done, wearing the tricolour is not disrespectful, he feels. a tee-shirt with the flag, for instance, is a good idea. ""we were slaves for centuries, did not have our own flag. and when we do, we have not had the right to display it for 54 years. it is a shame."" jindal's battle is against the attitude that flying the tricolour is a privilege reserved for a special few. ""it is every indian's flag,"" he asserts. jindal, who is the executive vice chairman and managing director of jindal steels and power ltd, juggles cause and career adroitly. he has been doing so for years. it all began when as a 20-year-old mba student in texas university, a homesick jindal discovered his love for the motherland. ""i was inspired by the pride that the americans took in displaying their flag. i wanted to do that too."" he did. and spent the rest of his student years in the us with a large tricolour dominating all else in his room. jindal brought back with him his deep attachment to the symbol of indian sovereignty. in india, he flew the tricolour at home and work with all ceremony due it. but the authorities were not amused. the government removed the flags and a distraught jindal sued in court. the young businessman admits he had not expected so long a legal battle. ""the case took very little time in the high court. but once the government took the matter to the supreme court, it has gone on for years."" he is now awaiting a final supreme court judgment, perhaps on november 6, the next date of hearing. jindal regrets the delay over ""so harmless an issue"". over the years, he has gathered much support in his campaign. most people he talks to get convinced, he claims. even the p d shenoy committee set up by the government to look into the issue made recommendations in favour of his argument. the theory is simple. jindal believes there is a revolution waiting in the wings if indians are allowed to display the national flag. the dream is larger. of making better people by bringing them together on a positive note. ""it is symbolism. it won't solve problems but it would be a small, meaningful act of patriotism.""

16,"Cops await promotions, govt plans transfers","ahmedabad: the police fraternity perhaps got a feel of the shape of things to come with the sudden transfer of superintendent of police r b brahmbhatt from the sensitive border district of banaskantha to gandhinagar which was effected immediately on tuesday night. and this happened when the district was grappling with a security problem, first with the escape of four pakistanis and then with the getaway of the rdx carriers. that the four pakistani nationals had escaped from this district just a day before the transfer and that the rdx passage was not 'effectively intercepted' in the same district, might just be coincidences. sources in the home department say brahmbhatt's countdown had begun since some six months back when he had reportedly insisted on being posted as sp of this district after having served as dy sp, in a term that totalled seven years in one station! what exactly prompted this isolated decision is an issue of investigation, but it has certainly sent shock waves in the ips cadre, where some 22 officers from the 1982-83 and the 1986-87 batches are awaiting their promotions for the last two years. these include nine officers from the dig to ig grade and 13 from the sp to dig grade apart from six waiting to be made dgs and three waiting to be made additional dgs. and the common refrain of the ministers in charge of the home department in the past year have been ""we will expedite it"". when tnn asked the new minister of state for home gordhan zadaphia about the brahmbhatt episode he said, ""hamare yahan to ye sab hota rahta hai"" (these things keep happening here). seeing the spate of transfers in the ias cadre effected after narendra modi became chief minister, police officers are now speculating if they would meet the same fate under the new dispensation. many feel ""things won't be much different"", implying that favouritism, casteist and regional biases will continue to dog the politics of ips transfers! but all depends on the equations preceding the popular mandate that awaits modi. as the officers due for promotions wait impatiently, the state government mulls over appointments to crucial posts like that of dig (border range) which handles security issues of the three border districts of kutch, patan and banaskantha and has been vacant for two months. incidentally, brahmbhatt's was not the only isolated transfer, assistant commissioner of police (crime) subhash trivedi was also similarly shifted some months back and has yet to be succeeded, albeit he had spent over two years in this branch. ""the authorities were probably waiting for an opportunity to move brahmbhatt,"" observes a senior ips officer. earlier there have been instances of ips officers being moved within months of their posting at a particular station, like manoj shashidhar who was moved out of dangs in 1998 to banaskantha within a year of his posting when the anti-christian riots took place and then was moved out of banaskantha too within the same period. superintendent of police shashikant trivedi too was moved within ahmedabad city from zone i to zone vi and then rewarded with an independent district (junagadh), all within six months!

21,Gulbarga bandh total,"gulbarga: life remained paralysed on thursday in gulbarga which virtually shut in response to a bandh call demanding state tag to the hyderabad-karnatak region. the bandh, for which the call was given by the hyderabad-karnatak abhivruddhi horata samiti, was near-total and incident-free. business houses downed shutters and buses of neksrtc remained off the road. autorickshaws, however, plied as usual. the police took into custody former president and horata samiti president vaijanath patil, samata party district unit president basavaraj ingin, former legislator and advocate hanumanth rao desai, former zilla panchayat member gurushanta pattedar and 49 others on charges of forcibly downing the shutters of some commercial establishments in certain city areas. they were released later. some 200 persons were taken into custody in chincholi, the hometown of vaijanath patil, where the bandh evoked good response. however, the response to the bandh call was ""poor"" in other towns of the district, according to sources in the police department. flag unfurled: undaunted by government's rejection of their demands, the hyderabad-karnatak activists on thursday decided to carry their struggle forward. freedom fighter vidyadhar guruji unfurled the ``hyderabad-karnatak state flag'' comprising maps of bidar, gulbarga, raichur, koppal and bellary districts. the red-colour flag was hoisted at the hindi prachara sabha. releasing the map of hyderabad-karnatak state, vaijanath patil declared: ``it is the beginning of the movement for a separate state. the demand has become inevitable as requests, memoranda and agitation have failed to draw the attention of government. the samiti will visit all villages of the region to drive home the need for a separate state.'' the former minister charged the successive governments with ""grossly neglecting"" the hyderabad-karnatak region ever since it was liberated from the clutches of nizam rule circa 1948. the people of the region had not been given due attention to bring them on a par with their counterparts in other parts of the state. ``since governments have not evinced any interest in development, there is no option but to mount a concerted struggle for a separate state.'' vidyadhar guruji dropped hints that the samiti might give a call for ""non-cooperation"", the weapon that the mahatma used in india's struggle for independence from the british. former minister vishwanath reddy mudnal offered his life, along with those of samiti activists, if situation so warrants. ``i have some difference of opinion with the samiti but i will bow to the diktat of samiti's majority opinion.'' all-india muslim league president abdul hamid dabur and samata party functionary basavaraj ingin expressed support to the movement.

22,Bellary bandh flops,"bellary: the bandh call given by the members of hyderabad-karnataka abhivruddhi kriya samithi went off unheeded in bellary district. it was a total failure and no organisation or individual observed the bandh call even neglecting the observance of rajyothsava day as black day. but to nullify the bandh call and support the samithi, a couple of organisations - karnataka yuva pade and kannadanadu yuvaka sangha opposed the demand for separate hyderabad-karnataka state. intervening in the middle of the flag hoisting celebration when the in-charge dc k.h. aswathnarayana gowda, (zp chief executive officer) hoisted the kannada rajyothsava flag at the municipal junior college grounds, the members of karnataka yuva pade and kannadanadu yuvaka sangha led by b.m. siddana gowda and b.k. basappa, shouted slogans against the members of the samithi for demanding separate north karnataka state. they said though this region suffered injustice and remained backward due to step-motherly treatments by successive governments since the reorgnisation of indian union states, the demand for separate state was unwarranted as the great fathers of karnataka fought for akhand karnataka and the need of the hour was to preserve the sovereignty of the state. the members also demanded the government to heed to their plea on this occasion by submitting a memorandum addressed to district-in-charge minister m.y. ghorpade placing some of the burning issues that should be addressed by the government as this region remained continuously backward due to the lack of infrastructure in medical, education, irrigation and other basic facilities. these must be attended to immediately, the memorandum said. to provide justice to the students of this region and to wipe out the imbalance in the education sector, the pre-university board must be decentralised by constituting a separate board for the gulbarga division and as many projects meant for this region must be rejuvenated as most of the projects were either stalled or were yet to materialise, they demanded. in the meanwhile, a few members of the bellary zilla nirudyoga yuvakara sangha submitted a memorandum to the in-charge dc ashwathnarayana gowda to set right the lacunae in the education system so that the students of this region too could benefit and compete with other progressive parts of the state. while hoisting the flag at the municipal junior college, the in-charge dc ashwathnarayana gowda said that the government had envisaged many special programmes for the development of bellary district. rajya sabha member k.c. kondaiah and mp kolur basavana gowd performed the pooja for the portrait of bhuvaneswari devi to inaugurate the tableaux rally. legislative council member k. niranjan naidu, zp chairman venkatrao ghorpade, sp k.v. sharatchandra, kannada yuvaka sangha president s. pannaraj, city municipal council chairman v. lakshmamma, her deputy g. somasekhar reddy, film actor and director b.c. patil and others were present. later, a rally of tableaux organised by different departments was held which concluded at the dc office.

26,UP's disinvestment plan goes haywire,"lucknow: the up government's disinvestment plan has gone haywire. while no one has come forward to buy its 11 sick sugar mills ,tenders for which were floated around two months back ,the plans to sell off two sick cement factories have also hit a road blockade. the state government is awaiting clearance from the sbi before it could dispose of dalla and chunar cement factories. birlas had agreed to buy two sick cement factories. a deal of rs 241 crore was struck . basic formalities have also been cleared at the government level and financial institutions asked to go for one-time settlement to facilitate easy transaction. the sbi, however, threw a spanner by raising objections to the entire process. secretary to the chief minister alok ranjan told times news network here on wednesday that up government has taken initiatives to break this impasse. chief minister rajnath singh has written letter to union finance minister yashwant sinha to resolve the crisis, while industry secretary has personally met sbi chairman in new delhi to help government tide over the crisis. ""the response we have got is positive,"" said ranjan and added: ""if everything goes well then government may get sbi clearance very soon"". the disinvestment of sugar mills ,however,is more murkier. these government- owned mills have been put under the hammer for the second time. first bidding was called during mulayam singh yadav's time in 1994. no industrialist took interest in these proposals as one of the pre-requisite was that new employers will have to carry the burden of employees working in those mills. this time, the government tried to play safe. they gave voluntary retirement benefits to employees of these mills and then offered them for sale sans employees .but the government also added a new condition that new employer would have to run the mill and produce sugar. a senior official in the sugar industry said that this condition has made private entrepreneurs develop cold feet. prominent reasons were two - one was low viability of all these mills which have poor crushing capacity ranging from 800 tcd (tonnes crushed per day) to 2000 tcd. secondly the cane prices which were normally goverened by political priorities rather than market forces. the 11 mills put on sale are googli, munderwan, chitauni, barabanki, maliana, mahauli, rampur, hardoi, bareilly, nawabganj and nandganj. with no buyers in sight , the government is contemplating to run one of them on liaison basis.
