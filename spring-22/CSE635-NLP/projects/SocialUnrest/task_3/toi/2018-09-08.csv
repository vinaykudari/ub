0,Alternative govt needed: KRRS chief,"davanagere: karnataka rajya raitha sangha (krrs) chief prof m.d. nanjundaswamy said an ``alternative government'' is need of the hour as the government headed by s.m. krishna in the state is ``dead''. he told reporters here on wednesday that the tussle between farmers and the government is on and the laws don't favour them. prof. swamy said krrs and green army are organising the world farmers' day in bangalore on october 2 to discuss problems of farmers and those related to wto. farmers' representatives from across the world are expected to attend the meet. ``the state is reeling under severe drought, prices of agriculture products have slumped, purchasing power of farmers has declined and suicide cases of farmers are increasing by the day,'' he said. instead of visiting drought-hit regions and preparing reports, the government must conduct a scientific analysis of the loss incurred to crops, including paddy, maize and cotton. swamy said the government must analyse quantum of loan extended to farmers. ``why should there be a difference in the power supply between rural and urban sectors and why is subsidy given only to electric industries,'' he questioned. ``we don't believe in installing electric meters for agriculture.'' on the kudremukh mining, swamy said the problem can't be solved by submitting a memorandum to authorities. ``instead, the people must stage a dharna.''

3,"Downpour caused floods, says minister","lucknow: irrigation minister, om prakash singh, on friday said that the current flood situation in eastern up was due to a heavy rainfall experienced by maharajganj and gorakhpur districts, besides its adjoining areas in nepal. talking to media persons here, singh said a record rainfall of about 770 mm in these areas for three days from september 1 had caused water-logging leading to flash floods in rohin and rapti rivers. such a situation, he said, was very unusual. however, he said that all the embankments of the irrigation department were safe, except to that of damaged caused to one each in deoria and gorakhpur due to overflowing of the rainwater. in reply to a question, he said there was no need for an inquiry into the alleged breach of embankments, as it was not due to any neglect on the part of engineers. what was most urgent was the need for relief materials to the affected population. this task had already been stepped up after the visit of chief minister, rajnath singh, to the affected areas on thursday. he also said that he proposed to visit the area shortly. earlier, reviewing functioning of the pwd, singh, who is also minister of the department, said that the government had drawn up a plan to connect 3300 villages with roads during the current financial year after which the total number of villages connected with roads would go up to 65730 in the state. after execution of the above plan, he said only over 30,000 villages would be left without roads. besides this under the central government sponsored prime minister's ""gram sadak yogjna"" 1,047 roads would be taken up in 70 districts. the centre had already sanctioned rs 320 crores under this programme. singh said that from october 1, the department would repair all the roads in the state for which a sum of rs 120 crores had been allotted. dwelling upon the changes introduced in the tender system, the minister said that it was now monitored by a committee instead of that the executive engineer alone.

4,Revolt to cost BJP dear in municipal elections,"new delhi: the news of three delhi bjp mps resigning from party posts was received with a feeling of deja vu in party circles. ""we have seen such belligerence before. but we wonder how long it will last,"" quipped a senior party leader when he heard that madan lal khurana, sahib singh and vijay kumar malhotra had offered to resign, ostensibly to protest chandni chowk mp vijay goel's inclusion in the union cabinet. however, at the same time, the local leaders feared that the development might have an adverse impact on the forthcoming municipal polls. local party president mange ram garg said the central leadership would have to guage the impact of this political revolt on the mcd poll. ""the party is above individuals. we are a cadre-based party where everyone is a worker. if a few are absent, there are many more to replace them."" garg said he did not have confirmed reports on the resignation of the three leaders. ""the matter rests with the central leadership. it is for them to decide the political fate of the three leaders. i am sure the party president will take a decision in favour of the party,"" he said. while garg was discreet on the political impact of the resignations, others in the party said if the resignations are accepted it could mean a serious setback to the city politics. ""khurana, malhotra and sahib singh are the only three leaders in delhi who have a formidable political base. the infighting between them took its toll in the 1998 assembly elections. now that the three have got together, it would be difficult for the party to mobilise support in the coming mcd poll,"" a party insider said. while khurana and malhotra are popular among the punjabi electorate, sahib singh has a formidable base among the jats in outer delhi. the city bjp is already wracked by internal squabbles. garg is reportedly at loggerheads with the three leaders, who have expressed their displeasure on the functioning of the party on a few occasions in the past. while this time, khurana, sahib singh and malhotra have directed their tirade against prime minister atal behari vajpayee for selecting a relatively younger delhi mp vijay goel for a ministerial berth, they had been the chief dissidents against the local party leadership for last three-years. internal bickerings in the city bjp had disseminated when mange ram was elected the state president. to bring peace between the two warring factions — one led by madan lal khurana and another by sahib singh — the party high command had nominated garg, a lesser-known party worker. virtually shunned from the city politics, khurana and verma had a political rapprochement. both along with malhotra formed a pressure group in the state bjp.

""i have seen the pleasure a person gets if he is able to write his name. to put a thumb imprint is not the same thing,"" he said. and then could not resist: ""the thumb is a very important part, of course. there are times when you need to show it too."" lauding the achievements made in literacy, the prime minister also warned against complacency, saying the deficiencies had to be kept in mind too. ""there is still scope for progress"", he said, adding educators and social organisations could play a key role in this. vajpayee said there was need to emphasise literacy in the slums of big cities. he also urged more effort in ensuring female literacy. ""only six states have less than 50% female literacy now"", he said. the government, the prime minister said, was committed to 100% literacy. he cited the examples of neighbouring sri lanka, with 93% male and 87% female literacy and bangladesh for progress in literacy. awards were given out at the function, which was also addressed by joshi and minister of state for human resource development rita verma. joshi said for the first time after independence, the ""absolute number of illiterates in the country has been reduced by 32 million."" the minister also promised all efforts to introduce in the winter session of parliament a bill making primary education a fundamental right. the pm, who got a standing ovation for the only address of the day not read out, won the day with the story of a priest who was asked how many sons he had: 'one', said the priest. then a little later, 'three', still later 'nine', '100' and then finally, 'none'. to the perplexed man who wanted to know, the priest then explained: ""well, i have one son. when he eats, it's like three. when he sleeps, he does so sprawled out like nine men. when he's out playing, he makes enough noise for a 100. and when its time to study, he disappears.""

18,'Scrap ratification of President's rule',"patna: senior state vice-president of the lok janshakti party, kamalnath singh thakur has called upon the constitution review panel to consider the desirability of scrapping the provision regarding rajya sabha's ratification necessity for the continuation of president's rule in any state. in a statement issued on thursday, thakur said that the recent experiences had shown how thoroughly discredited governments could comfortably continue in states simply if a ruling party or a coalition at the centre has no majority in the rajya sabha. thakur said bihar is a fit example where law and order had completely failed, financial irregularities were at the peak and hundreds of contempt cases have been pending in the courts. the patna high court, on more than one occasion, had talked about the symptom of constitutional breakdown in the state. but the president's rule could not be imposed because the congress was more than ready to oppose it in the rajya sabha where it has a majority, he added. thakur mentioned that the finance bills are exempt from rajya sabha's approval as the founding fathers wanted the lower house to have the real power to decide the fate of the country. if necessary changes are not brought in then the country could slowly disintegrate, he warned, insisting that a weakened centre in this age of repeated fractured mandate could only be reduced to a mute spectator.

21,Mayawati flexes muscles for UP polls,"new delhi: with uttar pradesh chief minister rajnath singh hinting at the possibility of early assembly elections, behind-the-scenes political activity has picked up in the state. the term of the current assembly runs out march next. the 'demotion' of ram vilas paswan in the union cabinet and the announcement of quota for the obcs and dalits in the state have added to the political temperature as even bigwigs from the samajwadi party, the bjp and bsp gun for one another. in demoting paswan, many observers say, the bjp has tried to curry favour with its bete noire mayawati. ""the bjp is preparing ground for a tie-up with the bsp by sidelining paswan, whose lok shakti is being seen as a liability and who has emerged as a rival dalit leader to mayawati,"" says an observer. however, mayawati discounts this possibility. she says the bsp will have no truck with any party, though she is holding her fire against the bjp. ""we will go it alone. our experience from the previous alliances with the bjp shows that it (the bjp) cannot get the upper-caste vote transferred to us. we will contest all the 403 seats on our own and form the next government,"" says the former chief minister. finding fault with the new quota announced by the chief minister for the obcs and the dalits, mayawati says: ""in principle, the bsp is not opposed to any quota. but it is not in proportion with the population of obcs and the dalits. and where is the reservation in the judiciary, the vidhan parishad and the private sector?"" hitting out at mulayam singh yadav, ram vilas paswan and congress leaders, mayawati says: ""mulayam is scared to go it alone. that's why he has hurriedly cobbled together a ragtag coalition called the lok morcha. the bsp will never sup with him. as for paswan, he is the epitome of opportunism in indian politics. he can tie up with anyone for the loaves of power. he cannot live without a post. his lok shakti will be decimated this time. about the congress, its obituary has already been written."" describing rajnath singh as ghoshnanath singh, sp leader amar singh says: ""rather than indulge in gimmickry of announcements, rajnath singh should have addressed the problems which will become the real issue during the elction. up has a deficit of rs 70,000 crore, but this man keeps making expensive announcements. worse still, they are trying to use the killing of phoolan to garner upper-caste votes. their niyat (intentions) and niti (politics) are a shame."" the sp leader calls mayawati ""the most unpricipled political leader"", and adds that ""the third bjp-bsp affair will be another doomed attempt. the bsp and the bjp are star-crossed lovers"". writing the congress off, he says: ""the sp will have nothing to do with a party of selective secularism and selective amnesia."" for leaders of the congress, which ruled the state for 40 years, it is harking back to the ""good old era"". the party says it will make 'development' its usp.

22,State's disinvestment of PSUs slows down,"gandhinagar: the gujarat government's aim to go in for massive disinvestment of state public sector enterprises and withdraw from economic activities has run into rough weather. after closing down six state-owned enterprises and starting disinvestment of as many others, things have reached a grinding halt. the officially-sponsored manu shroff committee report on public finance reforms had said earlier this year that ""inappropriate policy interventions"" were causing ""waste and a serious misallocation of resources"". now, the latest comptroller and auditor general of india report indicts the state government of continuing to provide ""financial support"" to inefficient and loss-making state psus. it said though their paid-up capital showed complete erosion, the support was being provided ""in the form of contribution towards equity, further grant of loans, conversion of loans into equity, subsidy."" the figures cited by cag as example of failure of withdrawing from economic activity are alarming. the cag suggests that total investment in 45 state psus in two years is up instead of going down. it was rs 10,976 crore in 1999, reaching rs 14,224 crore in 2000. investment in six statutory corporations (gujarat electricity board, state road transport corporation, state finance corporation, state warehousing corporation and industrial development corporation) was also up from rs 8,247 crore to rs 9,214 crore. five loss-making units studied separately were provided with a state financial support of rs 116 crore! a top source close to the cm said psu closure and disinvestment has been ""temporarily halted"". indeed, ever since the bjp came to power in 1998, the only major success was the privatisation of the gujarat tractor corporation to mahindra and mahindra. on december 18, 1999, the state's 51 per cent shares along with management control were transferred. thereafter, another 9 per cent state shares were transferred. officials explain that the process of withdrawing from economic activity is ""bound to be slow"" because of procedural and market hurdles. two attempts to privatise gujarat communications and electronics have failed in a year, while the privatisation process of gujarat state export corporation, in ""final stages"", is failing to be clinched because of ""the refusal of the interested party to take a firm decision."" the gujarat mineral development corporation's 26 per cent shares were disinvested way back in november 1997. but as for the rest of 23 per cent shares to be divested, an official source admits that ""the government is looking for a suitable market condition."" the gujarat industrial investment corporation, after facing a similar fate, decided to ""restructure"" itself, with the state government increasing its intervention by giving guarantee worth hundreds of crores to create a fund to finance state infrastructure projects! the six psus closed down are _ state textile corporation, state construction corporation, fisheries development corporation, small industries corporation, dairy development corporation and the slum clearance board. business operations in these psus have been discontinued, and employees have been given vrs in phases. but since two years, things have slowed down. in the 2000-01 budget speech, state finance vajubhai vala had said it would mop up rs 400 crore by way of disinvesting and closing down state psus. he gave no such promise in the new budget, okayed last month in the assembly. says economist archana dholakia in a recent paper: ""to meet the consumption and investment requirement of the psus, the state has to collect large amount of taxes."" dholakia's calculations show that the ratio of total government expenditure in the economy should exceed 25 per cent, lest it would ""prove counter-productive"". in gujarat it is nearly 36 per cent of the net state domestic product, suggesting inevitability of economic reforms.

23,Jaiswal criticises govt flood control measures,"lucknow: uttar pradesh congress committee president shri prakash jaiswal on saturday expressed anguish over the plight of people affected by floods in eastern parts of the state. talking to reporters, the upcc president said that people in gorakhpur, siddharthnagar, maharajganj, padrauna, kushinagar and deoria were facing insurmountable problems, yet many ministers in the rajnath singh government were on foreign jaunts. jaiswal also questioned the government and asserted that if the government had itself accepted that the water level of all rivers in the eastern parts were flowing above danger level, then why did it sleep over this problem. he said the congress governments in the past had prepared schemes to control floods in the eastern parts of the state, but the non-congress governments had shelved all those projects. he said it was ironical that about 200 people had already lost their lives in the flood, but the government was still making schemes for the protection of the people. he said if the suggestions made by the previous congress governments to control floods in uttar pradesh had been heeded, the people would not have faced this ordeal. jaiswal said if work on sharda sahayak canal and gandak canal had been completed, the people would not have had to face floods every year. the upcc president said if the government had taken a look at flood-protection work in may and june, embankments would have remained intact and there would not have been any need for shifting people to safer places. jaiswal also alleged that the government was deleting names of genuine voters from the list. this was being done to help bjp candidates at the time of poll, he said.
