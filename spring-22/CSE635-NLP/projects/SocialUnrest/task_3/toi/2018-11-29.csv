2,Take up bar timing issue with govt: HC tells forum,"mumbai: the bombay high court on wednesday directed the forum for ecology and environment to take up its grievances regarding beer bar timings with the government before knocking on the doors of the judiciary. the forum had filed a public interest litigation challenging a government notification dated may 24 permitting beer bars with dance floors to remain open well beyond midnight. the forum feared that extended hours of such bars would result in ``law and order problems'', a contention which was opposed by the government. the pil argued by counsel majeed memon was allowed to be withdrawn by division bench comprising chief justice b.p. singh and justice d.y. chandrachud. a similar application can be made before the government. the pil questioned the legality of the notification permitting beer bars and permit rooms with dance floors all over the state to remain open till 1.30 a.m. it said the notification was a product of ``total non-application of mind'' by the government. it said the authorities had not applied the required legal checks and permission was granted hastily in clear violation of the provisions of law relating to public order and safety under the police act, 1951.

3,No takers in Bihar govt for NHRC pleas,"patna: the bihar government appears to have mocked the national human rights commission (nhrc) by ignoring its repeated pleas for providing it with documents relating to the beating up of a political worker in jail by the then begusarai dm, harjot kaur, and her bodyguard. already three letters have been sent by the nhrc to the chief secretary and ig of prisons, and in the meeting on november 5, the commission decided to give the state government authorities the last opportunity to submit the reports by december 10, an official of the home department stated. ironically, kaur herself is now the ig of prisons. kaur was initially to be moved to the road construction department but was suddenly shifted to jail departme-nt at the last moment, said an official. in spite of a notice sent to the chief secretary and ig of prisons, bihar, and thereafter three reminders, no reply has yet been received from either of them. a final reminder is being sent to them asking positively for a reply within four weeks failing which it would be assumed that the government of bihar has no reply to give and the commission would be constrained to proceed with the matter on that assumption, the nhrc says in its last letter. the nhrc has taken suo motu cognizance of the incident on the basis of the sixth report tabled by the human rights committee of the bihar legislative council on march 23 this year. the council is the only house in india to have such a body, and its earlier reports on the infamous deepa murmu case were highly appreciated by the nhrc. the report tabled in march had been sent to the nhrc. after taking cognizance of the incident in which a jd(u) worker was allegedly abused and beaten up by kaur and her bodyguard in the case no 107/99, the commission has been sending letters to the state government asking for report. the committee members headed by arun kumar visited begusarai on july 8, 2000. it concluded that kaur had slapped the prisoner and her bodyguard had beaten him up. the committee alleged that kaur had attempted to hide facts from it regarding the incident. it also alleged that the then jail superintendent and jail doctor played a dubious role in this matter. incidentally, kaur's transfer to the post of ig of prisons appears to be no coincidence. the house panel report was also submitted to the state government, and it could not have been ignorant of the fact that the posting would cause a major embarrassment. but the government appears to have shown scant respect for the legislative panel and nhrc.

4,9.30 am cabinet meet sealed ministers’ fate,"new delhi: the prelude to wednesday's resignation drama started on monday morning when chief minister shiela dikshit cancelled the weekly cabinet meeting and rushed to meet congress president sonia gandhi. her motive: to seek the party central leadership's approval for her intended cabinet reshuffle. her reasoning: with the government completing three years in power, it was an opportune time to review the functioning of her ministers. a change of face would not only help the congress in the mcd poll, but also give other congress leaders a chance to be in the government. having sought the leadership's approval, dikshit started the political manoeuvring. an emergency cabinet meeting was hastily convened at 9.30 am on wednesday. after hectic parleys and negotitiations, the ministers appended their signatures on a common resignation letter. finance minister mahinder singh saathi had moved the resolution, which he claimed was done voluntarily. ''in the situation that had been fabricated around us, we had the courage to take a decision,'' he said in defence of his move. while industry minister narendra nath chose not to comment, health minister a k walia said the entire cabinet stood united on this decision. standing next to dikshit he said: ''the decision to resign was entirely our own. there was no pressure from the chief minister.'' the ministers were, nevertheless, visibly uncomfortable in the new situation. transport minister parvez hashmi did not attend office, while walia came attired in more colourful leisure wear instead of his usual white khadi suit. the likely faces for the new cabinet — congress legislators deep chand bandhu, arvinder singh lovely, prahad singh sawhney, naseeb singh — were among the first to mark their presence in the chief minister's office.

14,FCI flayed for ignoring farmers,"vijayawada:former member of rajya sabha and farmers' leader yelamanchili sivaji has asked the food corporation of india (fci) to clearly define its mandate vis-a-vis the procurement of foodgrains. sivaji wondered whether the fci was in the market to help the rice millers or the farmers. why are they lifting only rice from the millers and not paddy from the farmers, he asked. there was no clarity on the fci's role in the procurement process as the levy procurement was no longer warranted, sivaji told the times of india. the situation has taken a complete u-turn in the country since all the states, except kerala, became selfsufficient in foodgrain production, sivaji pointed out. the states were not even lifting the allotted quantity of foodgrains as they had adequate stocks, he said. sivaji said lifting of rice by various states was just about 5.75 million tonnes as against the allotted 10.96 million tonne. similarly, only 2.72 million tonnes of wheat was lifted as against the allotted 7.5 million tonnes, he said. while the country required a buffer stock of 16.8 million tonnes of foodgrains, over 60 million tonnes was lying in the fci godowns at present.this might go up to 70 million tonnes by the end of this procurement season, the he pointed out. with the exports declining over the years and the local markets too collapsing, the farmers have been hit hard and they have been looking towards the fci for procurement. however, the fci prefers to lift rice instead of paddy, showing a clear bias towards the millers at the cost of the poor farmers, sivaji said. against this backdrop, the fci should come out with its mandate and specify whether it was in the market to ensure minimum support price for farmers or feed the public distribution system, sivaji said.

17,Another marks-tampering case appears in law faculty,"mumbai: it is going to take a long time for the mumbai university's law faculty to live down this one. even as the varsity deals with a report implicating the registrar's son for malpractice in the ll.b. examinations, yet another case of marks-tampering has surfaced in the law faculty. this time, the son of former law faculty head vijay chitnis is alleged to have benefited. he is currently a member of the state human rights commission. the varsity's unfair means inquiry committee is currently investigating this case, involving the alleged alteration of marks in the marks-lists and answer-books of three candidates. one of these mr chitnis' son, who appeared for the third year ll.b. examination in april\may this year. vice-chancellor b.l. mungekar told tnn that he had personally seen the alteration of marks. i referred the matter to the committee immediately, he said. considering the fact mr chitnis' son's name has cropped up, and in view of the current situation wherein the registrar's son had been implicated in an exam scandal mr mungekar said he would be asking the committee to expedite the inquiry and submit its report soon. speaking to this newspaper, mr chitnis said he had not received any official communication about the matter. my son's results had been withheld, so i had met the vice-chancellor in this connection, he said, adding that he was waiting to find out the outcome of the inquiry. mr chitnis also stated that he did not think there could have been any malpractice in his son's case and also denied having influenced the results. explaining the 'marks-tampering' involved in the three cases, sources stated that the varsity followed a system of 'masking' seat numbers in answer-sheets before sending it to the examiners concerned. after assessment is completed, answer-sheets are sent to the computer section, where the 'masking' is removed. marks are then ente-red into the computer against the seatnumbers and the answer-sheets sent back to the examiners, who record the marks on paper__against the actual seat-numbers. translated, this means that the examiner gets to know the seat number of a student only after he\she completes the assessment and after the marks arerecorded in the computer. in the case of the three candidates, lots of changes were made in the mark-sheets and the answerbooks, after the marks had been entered in the computer, sources said. the discrepancies between the marks recorded in the computer and that finally shown in the actual mark-lists and answer-books were detected by the examination section dealing with results. it forwarded a complaint about the matter to senior varsity officials and the unfair means inquiry committee was asked to look into the 'alteration' of marks. the committee discussed the issue and noted at a meeting that the complaints were of a serious nature and that the alterations could have been carried out only with the connivance of many elements in the system and with systematic planning. before the committee could inquire further, it was dissolved for a host of reasons, one of them being leaking reports to the press. a new unfair means committee has now been constituted.

19,Bill proposes stricter rules for private power projects,"pune: having learnt a lesson from the raging enron controversy in the state, the union power ministry has chalked out revised guidelines for sanctioning private power projects in the future. the guidelines have been included in the power 2001 bill that has been submitted to the lok sabha. this was revealed by uma shankar sharma, director, central electricity authority (cea), who was in the city on wednesday to discuss the ministry's project 'mission -2012 - power for all,' with mseb officials. citing an example, he said, the calling of tenders for power projects, which was not done at the time of the enron project, has now been made compulsory. mr sharma, who was in town as part of the ministry's renewed efforts to reach out to power sector employees and consumers across the country, however, dwelt at greater length on mission 2012. the senior technocrat said that the country's power requirement was expected to go up by 1 lakh mw over the next ten years. this required an increased capacity which would cost rs 4 lakh crore. having invested so heavily on increasing power generation, suitable changes and improvement in the transmission and distribution (t&d) sector would become imperative to check power thefts and t&d losses, he said. state electricity boards are losing rs 20,000 crore in revenue on account of thefts and losses, he said. the government therefore plans to invest another rs 4 lakh crore for upgrading and improving t&d systems. additional lines would be laid and a national grid of all supply lines is to be created. nearly 80,000 villages are be electrified by 2007, he said.the ministry has earmarked rs 1,500 crore for improving t&d system and renovation of the metering system in the country for year 2001-02, under its accelerated power development programme. the ministry also plans to prepare a uniform power policy for the country, on the basis of which the cea would prepare a blueprint for electricity management every five years. suggestions and recommendations from the citizens, power companies and others would be invited before finalising the blueprint, he said. to tackle the problem of grid tripping and blackouts caused by states drawing more power than their sanctioned quota, mr sharma said that a national load despatch centre, besides regional centres, has been mooted in the power bill. the national and regional load despatch centres will monitor the demand and availability of power in the country and suggest suitable load-shedding measures. the regional despatch centres will also be asked to look after the transmission and quality of power. bill proposes stricter rules for private power projects

20,Principals come to govt's rescue,"pune: the state federation of principals and headmasters of secondary and higher secondary schools has supported the state government's decision to allow junior college students to chose information technology (it) as a subject in lieu of marathi. the decision has been criticised by political parties and literary bodies, but the federation has warned the government against going back on its decision, saying it would launch a fierce agitation if it did so. a statement released by president of the federation, raosaheb awari, says allowing students to choose it will help poor and backward-class students acquire it skills. he criticised politicians for creating an unnecessary controversy over the issue. the statement points out that marathi has always been an optional subject at the 10+2 level since 1975, when syllabus for it was first introduced. almost 60 per cent of higher secondary school students in the state opt for marathi, while the remaining 40 per cent choose hindi, gujarati or another indian or foreign languages. to buttress its point, the federation says almost all students who opted for bi-focal courses (electronics, or computer science in lieu of second language), or minimum competency vocational courses, like scooter, radio repairing, when vocational courses were introduced at the 10+2 level in 1978, had left out marathi. the federation further says that, earlier only science students opting for bi-focal courses had the option of it, and those in other streams were deprived of it. the state government's decision will open up the sector for students in other streams as well, it argues. the federation appealed to politicians and critics of the government decision to read the resolution carefully, and stop opposing it.

22,"No violation of airspace, says government","new delhi: union defence minister george fernandes said thursday that there had been no violation of airspace by us navy helicopter. fernandes categorically stated that that the us navy helicopter did not fly over the nuclear plant at kalapakkam, nor had there been any violation of the indian territory by the us warship uss john young, from where the copter had taken off. chief of air staff, air chief marshal a y tipnis also said there was no violation of indian airspace by us naval helicopter. ""i don't think there is anything to be alarmed about it as civil aviation has said there was no violation of airspace. at the most, they may have probably violated the air traffic"", tipnis told reporters at the national defence academy (nda) at khadkwasala near pune after reviewing the passing out parade (pop) of its 101st course. india and us have an agreement that indian ports would be used for refuelling us planes, and these planes can also fly over indian territories. the agreement was in support of us war efforts in afghanistan. a helicopter belonging to the us navy was reported to have violated indian airspace without requisite permission and hovered in the chennai airspace for over two hours earlier this week. the chopper had taken off from a us navy ship. read this story in...

24,All-party meeting inconclusive,"new delhi: the george fernandes reinduction stalemate continues, with neither the government nor the opposition willing to budge. a meeting called by the lok sabha speaker to resolve the imbroglio remained inconclusive on thursday. instead of a meeting of all opposition leaders as was expected, the speaker gmc balayogi met congress leaders shivraj patil and jaipal reddy and parliamentary affairs minister pramod mahajan to discuss the censure motion under rule 184 moved by the congress. the opposition is up in arms against the reinduction of fernandes as defence minister before being given a clean chit by the k. venkatswamy commission probing the tehelka expose. there are allegations against the minister that his party received kickbacks from journalists posing as arms dealers. the government's position is that the congress motion is untenable. it is objecting to the use of the words ""disapproves the reinduction of"" in the motion, saying it is the prime minister's prerogative to induct anyone as a minister in his cabinet. though the congress agrees that induction of a minister is the prime minister's prerogative, it is of the view that the propriety of certain actions of the government can be raised in the house. congress leaders said the party was ready to change the words of the motion and had even offered to do so at the meeting with the speaker, but the government is not willing to debate the matter under rule 184. congress spokesman jaipal reddy said his party was insisting on discussion under rule 184 as ""the motion should express a definitive opinion."" the wordings of a motion under rule 193, he said, would be too neutral. debate under rule 184 or the censure motion entails voting, while under rule 193 there is only a discussion. the government is pushing for the latter. the issue will now be pursued on monday, with another meeting with the speaker scheduled. balayogi will also meet leaders of other other opposition parties separately on the issue. the government, said sources, was treading carefully on the matter as it did not want to alienate fernandes and his samata party, a key national democratic alliance partner. meanwhile, the impasse means that the combined opposition will continue to embarrass the government by refusing to let the defence minister speak in house. it has already refused to put questions to fernandes in both the lok sabha and the rajya sabha. on thursday, the opposition, led by congress president sonia gandhi, staged a walkout in the lok sabha even as fernandes stood up to make a statement on the alleged airspace violation by a us helicopter over chennai earlier this week. an angry bjp spokesman v.k. malhotra said the opposition walkout was ""surprising and objectionable."" ""yesterday they walked out demanding a statement and today they walk out while the statement is being made. how can anyone else make a statement on a matter of defence save the defence minister?"" he asked. accusing the congress of denying the nation its right to know what was happening in the important defence ministry, he said not asking the minister questions was ""unprecedented and against parliament rules.""

25,Congress rules out truck with SP in UP polls,"new delhi: media hype over sonia gandhi-mulayam singh yadav breaking bread at a cpm arranged dinner notwithstanding, the congress on thursday ruled out any alliance or adjustment with samajwadi party in the uttar pradesh assembly polls, saying it did not want to turn the crucial northern state into ""another tamil nadu."" in an interview, aicc general secretary ghulam nabi azad said that his party plans to promise sub-quota for muslims and the poor belonging to upper castes and stepped up efforts for the welfare of scs, sts and farmers in the polls. ""we do not want to have another tamil nadu where over the years we aligned with either the dmk or aiadmk. it is high time we contest all the seats in up, which will also lead to increase in our votebank and boost the morale of our cadres,"" he said. asked about the ""sudden love and affection"" of sp towards the congress and its president sonia gandhi, he said that there was growing realisation among other parties that congress could no longer be dismissed and ""it will have a role in up in coming months."" azad, however, sought to stress that the participation of gandhi and yadav at a dinner meeting of opposition leaders did not have much significance for up. he said that the meeting was important for floor coordination in parliament, especially the lok sabha. he further said that the bjp-led coalition had benefited during the last two years as the coordination among non-nda parties was not up to the extent possible. when asked about chatterjee's reported statement that the coordination among opposition could even extend to up, azad said that he was not aware of any such development. ""somnathda is a well wisher of non-bjp parties and, therefore, he could have made the statement with a good sense,"" he added. he described as a ""wise"" move the sp's statement that it would no longer pursue the issue of foreign origin of sonia gandhi. ""after the supreme court judgement declaring gandhi as a citizen of india, it would have been ridiculous for any individual to pursue that. it would not have cut much ice. they have been wise enough to take that position,"" he said when asked about sp's changed stance on the issue. he did not agree with the description ""blunder"" for the decision of the party in the last assembly polls to tie up with bsp and contesting a mere 125 seats out of a total of 425, he said that it could be so only if the party aligned with others as major partners. azad, who was in charge of the state a decade back when the mandal and mandir issues gained centrestage, said that the parivartan yatras concluded recently by the party had shown that ""congress is no longer a non-entity or a totally bunk force"" in the state. ""our natural ally is the voter,"" azad quipped when asked as to whom his party regarded as its ally in up - the sp or the bsp. replying to a question, he said in uttar pradesh efforts were on to ""come up on our own"" and there could be ""some arrangements with some smaller parties."" the senior congress leader emphasised that sp, bsp and bjp, who have been at the helm of affairs in the state during the past decade were all guilty of ""non-performance"" and it would be difficult for the voter to decide as to who was worse. on uttaranchal, azad claimed that the atmosphere in the hill state carved out of up was pro-congress and the party would be able to form its government there after the elections being held along with up.

28,Kerala's excise policy yet to be finalised,"thiruvananthapuram: finance and excise minister k. sankaranarayanan on thursday told the assembly that the government was against the existing system of participation of co-operatives in selling toddy and that the excise policy is yet to be finalised. replying to a calling attention of t.p. ramakrishnan (cpm) on the difficulties faced by the workers of toddy and liquor shops, the minister said government has not yet formulated the alternative system to be followed once the cooperative societies were disbanded. after the switch over of sale of foreign liquor from private retailers to beverages corporation outlets, the government was able to provide jobs to many persons who were earlier employed by various private imfl retailers, the minister said. it was a fact that all of them were not given job in the new set-up, he said, adding there were about 31,000 labourers in the old set-up. necessary steps would be taken by the government while finalising the policy to safeguard the interest of workers, he added.

29,Who’s who of politics at Hussain’s <I>Iftaar</i> party,"new delhi: the annual iftaar party of the bjp's union minister syed shahnawaz hussain is rapidly becoming something of a social event. on thursday evening, not only did prime minister vajpayee, accompanied by several of his ministerial colleagues, show up for the occasion, but also three former pms v p singh, i k gujral and chandra shekhar, rajya sabha chairperson krishna kant, his deputy najma heptullah, lok sabha speaker g m c balayogi, deputy leader of the congress shivraj patil, opposition mps and ambassadors from several muslim countries. last year the pm had chosen hussain's iftaar to clarify his controversial statement on the ayodhya issue, and thus made headlines. this year all he did to oblige the tv cameras was to don a variety of caps presented to him by an unending stream of muslim clerics hustled for the occasion. the pm chose not to speak, partly because of conflicting views among his press managers, partly because he had spoken on saturday at party spokesperson v k malhotra's lunch, and possibly because he did not want to answer awkward questions about the continuing ''political boycott'' of defence minister george fernandes. so as the evening wore on, the spotlight shifted to socialite nafisa ali, actor and mimic shekhar suman and the proprietress of a well-known newspaper, and those who routinely bridge the page one-page three gap — actors- turned-mps rajesh khanna, shabana azmi, vinod khanna and shatrughan sinha. the muted message, if any, was that having elevated the youthful hussain to cabinet status, the bjp meant to use the symbolism of a muslim minister to the hilt, especially with the uttar pradesh elections round the corner. on hand to help were hussain's former media savvy colleagues from the bharatiya janata yuva morcha. significantly, hussain's do outshone both in numbers and variety of guests union human resource development minister murli manohar joshi's diwali party earlier in the evening — joshi could personally exchange a few words with all his guests, hussain looked harassed and hard- pressed with so many vvip guests around.

32,Bitumen transporters take govt for a ride,"guntur: the transporters and road contractors have fleeced rs 500 crore from the state government during the last five years in the form of transport charges of bitumen (tar) produced at indian oil corporation (ioc) in chennai, according to vigilance and enforcement department. a probe by the department in guntur reveals that the contractors charged the government even for the return trip to chennai after supplying the tar for the road works in the state, though the tender signed with contractors in 1995 mentions no such stipulation. the sec 29 of the ap departmental code also prohibits payment for empty trip to the transporters. the bitumen is supplied by the indian oil corporation (ioc), which it produces as a byproduct of petroleum. till 1995 it used to deliver by its own tankers at appointed places for use in roadmaking charging 80 paise per tonne per km for the to and fro distance. in 1995 the ioc asked the state government to make its own arrangements for transportation of bitumen.the government awarded tenders to transporters with the lowest bid at rs 1.60 per km per tonne. but in 2000 the state government asked the road contractors to make their own arrangements for tranportation of bitumen from chennai. the vigilance and enforcement department has discovered that the contractors in their tenders put the transport charges at rs 2.20 per km for to and fro distance, causing losses to state exchequer. the vigilance and enforcement department has advised the government to recover the excess amount paid to the contractors and not to pay for to and fro distance.

33,Udupi civic polls promise keen contest,"udupi: the congress and the bjp are locked in a fierce battle in the december 9 elections that will decide who the new occupants of udupi's civic offices will be the congress, which is banking on its performance in its just-concluded tenure in office, is the favoured horse and has fielded 88 candidates for the elections. the bjp has fielded 77 candidates in its seemingly difficult task of wresting the udupi office from the congress kitty. for the bjp, the battle seems to be tough. some 255 candidates are in the fray that include a whopping 80 independents who may swing the balance against the congress. ten janata dal (united) candidates are trying their luck at the hustings. karnataka pradesh congress committee (kpcc) general secretary t.v. maruthi, who has been deputed observer for the elections, exuded confidence that the party will romp home given that maximum weightage had been given to the local people while picking the contestants. releasing the list of party's official candidates, maruthi said the congress was counting on ``development work'' carried out in the town. ``i am sure the party will come out with flying colours.'' lok sabha member vinay kumar sorake, district congress committee president m.a. gafoor, legislator u.r. sabhapathy, congress seva dal chief ashok kaodavoor, block congress committee president mahabala kunder accompanied maruthi when party candidates filed their papers. eleven sitting members --including outgoing president anandi, vice-president renold praveen kumar, former vice-president kushal shetty and dr ramananda bhat -- have been renominated while 24 first-timers will face the electorate. also in the fray are 15 women candidates, four christian and two muslim candidates. some of the wards in the general category have been the stranglehold of women contestants who have been awarded the tickets. releasing the party list, bjp karnataka unit vice-president v.s. acharya, also the member of the legislative council, said the backward community had been given due representation. ``candidates from the backward community have been fielded from some of the general category wards as well. merit and loyalty to the party were the guiding forces during selection process,'' he said, adding women and youth were given seats. the party has renominated four councillors. prominent candidates are former president (of udupi municipal council) gujjadi prabhakar nayak, bjp women's wing leader sudhakar shetty, party district unit president laxminarayana and general secretary udaykumar shetty. acharya said the bjp will wrest power from the congress since ``we have fielded the best of the candidates with proven track record in their social and public life''. this sleepy temple town of udupi will wake to a boisterous political campaigning as political bigwigs from the congress and bjp are expected to generate heat with the d-day drawing closer. the voters' only request: let civic issues not get sidestepped in the din of political oneupmanship.
