5,467 drunk drivers booked since Nov 22,"new delhi: the delhi police have prosecuted 467 drunk drivers during a special night patrol drive launched after a recent accident at chirag dilli left four persons dead. police targeted sensitive areas, especially near five star hotels and watering holes, and used breath analysers to judge the alcohol content in a driver's body. joint commissioner of police (traffic) maxwell pereira said the night patrol would continue for some time. ''we intend to maintain an element of surprise in our operation so that drivers remain alert,'' he said, refusing to divulge further details. the night patrol, launched on november 22, was initially planned for three days but was extended by two more days. sources said the drive would now focus on drunk driving during weekends. pereira said this drive would also be used as an opportunity to discipline traffic in the evening. ''since we have no deployment late in the evening when most accidents take place, the drive will help us check reckless driving as well,'' he said. the traffic police have also joined hands with the district police to check drunk driving. ''of the 467 drivers prosecuted so far, 69 were fined by the district police,'' a senior police official said. only 85 car users had been booked for drunken driving by the traffic police before the drive launched on november 22. last year, only 170 drunk drivers were prosecuted. the traffic police say drunk driving is more prevalent in winter when many festivals, including new year, are celebrated. ''people returning from liquor parties tend to drive rashly and ignore speed limits,'' said a traffic policeman. according to rule 185 of the central motor vehicle rules, if the alcohol content in the driver's blood exceeds 30 mg per 100 ml, he can be booked for drunk driving. the fine varies from rs 400 to rs 2,000. if the drunk driver is alone, he is usually not allowed to drive further and the vehicle is impounded. in case the driver is accompanied by someone, he is allowed to go only if the companion takes the wheel.

6,Engineer tries unusual suicide method,"new delhi: the police are probing an unusual incident in which a 30-year-old east delhi resident is said to have tried to commit suicide by chopping-off his genitals on wednesday night. the victim, sobti kumar mistri, had an engineering degree but worked as a teacher in a polytechnic. he survived the suicide attempt but his condition is critical. police said at 11 pm last night sobti's landlord came to his first floor room in hanuman mandir gali, mandawli, to replace a light bulb. the landlord saw blood coming out from under the door and informed the police. on breaking open the door, the police found the victim unconscious in a pool of blood. ''we initially thought that he victim was dead. but at lal bahadur shastri hospital, the doctors were able to revive him. he was later shifted to gtb hospital where he is battling for life,'' said a police officer. the police also found a razor blade, which sobti had used in his suicide attempt. doctors said sobti had lost a lot of blood. they also said he had drunk large amounts of alcohol. ''we have not been able to record the victim's statement because he is very weak,'' the police said. he is still under the influence of alcohol, though that has started to wear off. however, he is heavily sedated, the police officer said. preliminary investigations have revealed that sobti had been depressed for several weeks. ''neighbours and friends told us he wanted to be an engineer and even did his b.tech from kolkata. but he could only get a job as a lecturer of electronics in nehru vihar polytechnic. this appears to be the primary cause of his depression,'' the police said. last month sobti's father, a doctor in west bengal, had come to visit. it appears that the victim's family had come to cheer him up. however, neighbours were not able to shed too much light about sobti as he had moved to his present house less than a month back. since no suicide note was found, police said they were searching for clues which would establish why sobti tried to kill himself. ''things should clear up once the victim regains consciousness and can make a statement,'' said a police official.

8,Call for new land acquisition law,"new delhi: people who get displaced because of government projects are paid compensation under the prevailing law, but there is scarcely any attention to their resettlement and rehabilitation. for the law under which land is acquired to serve ''public purpose'', the land acquisition act, 1894, simply does not provide for it. it is to address this and several other issues concerning the act that several voluntary organisations (vos) have sought a new law governing land acquisition in the country. following a two-day workshop here, they have even come up with a draft bill which provides for the rehabilitation and resettlement of displaced persons. the vos now plan to lobby among parliamentarians to push for a fresh legislation governing land acquisition, says s r hiremath, president, national committee for protection of natural resources. while there are no exact estimates on how many people have been displaced over the last five decades for various government projects, their numbers run into lakhs. the draft bill calls for an independent mechanism to examine if a project for which land is being acquired will really benefit the people. says senior supreme court advocate prashant bhushan: ''the present law does not allow an independent authority to examine if the project will be in public interest.'' the present act, in fact, is governed by the doctrine of eminent domain which says that ''the right of the state or the sovereign to its or his property is absolute while that of the subject or citizen to his property is only paramount. the citizen holds his property subject always to the right of the state or the sovereign to take it for public purpose''. this ''public purpose'', however, is not clearly defined in the present act, say vos. the present act also does not define project affected persons, say vos. this definition has been included in the draft bill, they say. yet another provision in the draft bill is aimed at facilitating the spread of information to the affected persons. as the vos put it, ''people have a right to know the process of acquisition at different stages and to raise objections'', if any. significantly, the draft also gives a gram sabha the right to give or withhold consent to a project. as for the present law, all that the government needs to do under it to acquire land is to first publish a preliminary notification, then give the affected persons an opportunity to be heard, declare that the land is required for public purpose and issue an order for its acquisition.

9,"It's all up to the govt now, says Jog","mumbai: much like the project it self, madhav jog's touted `test drive' on the andheri flyover on wednesday turned out to be a rather slow and bumpy ride. on december 5, the deadline for completing the flyover, journalists were taken across the flyover. but the rough ashpalting, occasional bumps and scores of workers still labouring on the just concretised section c showed that while the bridge was ``structurally ready'' it was far from usable. so when will the flyover be ready, really and truly? mr jog won't set a deadline this time. ``it is all up to the government now, '' he says. ``ninety-seven per cent of the work is done. all that remains is a week's work of asphalting and finishing, while curing of the concrete will take two weeks,'' mr jog said. `if the government wants, it can speed this up by sanctioning rs 5 lakhs for high-speed curing,'' he added. the public works department has already rejected this proposal. it was a self-assured, slightly belligerent mr jog who spoke to the press on wednesday, blaming everyone but himself for the delay in completing the flyover. ``instead of looking at the delay of a few days in finishing it, you should look at the 24-month delay.'' mr jog blames the delay on the public interest litigation which was filed against the project in november 1999, but also on the government for late payments. ``the government still owes me rs 25 crore for the additional work commissioned by the pwd, which was supposed to have been paid by september,'' he said. ``which contractor works before being paid? i could have stopped work but in the interests of the public i am finishing the flyover without being paid.'' on the other hand, he points out, his source of financing __ the sale of commercial space under the flyover __ was scuppered by the pil which had challenged the commercial use of that space. ``the nature and the structure of the project have changed from a build-operate-transport project to a part regular works contract,'' he said. ``and technically, i can claim time upto may 2002, given the clauses in the indian contract act.'' the act makes allowances for delays which are due to ``extraneous factors''. ``as a contractor i have my responsibilites but i also have my rights,'' he asserted, accusing the media of distorting the picture. ``i must thank the press for giving so much coverage. it is a rs 175 crore project but the column inches it has generated is worth much more,'' he said caustically. indeed, it was an aggressive, sarcastic mr jog, staking ``his rights'', who took on old and new allegations over the controversy-mired flyover head on, and without prompting. * on allegations that he instigated the pil himself: ``that's an interesting proposition. am i that big a fool to initiate a case against myself after already investing rs 65 crore on the project.'' * on rumours that he prolonged construction deliberately: ``jog must be stupid or a bloody fool to do that. of the three components of the bridge, the subways and the commercial space, i am only interested in the last which i can only profit from once the other two are complete.'' * on this being the most expensive flyover, at rs 110 crore: ``in the original project, the government would only spend rs 9 crore since i would sell space to finance it. in addition, it had six lanes, nine ground lanes, three subways and 1.5 lakh square feet of parking space.'' mr jog also revealed that the cost of the project had gone up from rs 110 crore to rs 175 crore, with rs 40 crore being the interest on finance during the period of work suspension and rs 25 crore incurred on extra work commissioned by the pwd. * on whether the project has damaged his reputation: ``my credentials are impeccable. my firm completes 50 next year and one bridge does not make any difference to my prospects.''

10,Citizens' groups release manifesto for civic polls,"mumbai: are mumbaikars asking for too much if they expect political parties to field civic poll candidates who have no police record, have a known source of income and are able to grasp issues of civic governance? the answer is anyone's guess but citizens' groups feel there is no harm in asking anyway. so it is that agni and a host of other organisations on wednesday declared the draft citizens' manifesto for the civic elections next february. other parameters to judge candidates will be readiness to reveal assets on a periodical basis, understand the constituency's needs, a proven record of civic work and readiness to consult citizens. releasing the manifesto, former civic chief d.m. sukhtankar said political parties and candidates had been asked to endorse the demands listed in the manifesto. ``corporators should take the electorate into confidence and work closely with local organisations in the planning and execution of the civic works in the wards,'' he said. the manifesto requires elected representatives to work in cooperation with the civic authorities to cut costs and increase revenue. ``there is a tendency to blame the corporators and the authorities for all our problems. the fault is really ours that we do not elect the right candidates,'' said shirish deshpande of the mumbai grahak panchayat (mgp). besides agni, the citizens' organisations include dignity foundation, citispace, clean mumbai foundation and consumer guidance society of india.

13,"Man commits suicide after killing wife, 3 children","surat: in a bizarre incident, one diamond merchant brutally killed his wife and three children by smashing their heads with a wooden plank in the wee hours of wednesday at his house in hathfalia near mahidharpura. the diamond merchant, 39-year-old arvindbhai narendrabhai parikh, shocked by the incident committed suicide by consuming poison a few hours later. the victims have been identified as 35-year-old sangeeta, wife of arvindbhai, two sons - eight-year-old gaurav and saurabh, (14) - and 12-year-old rachna, the daughter of arvindbhai. preliminary investigations so far revealed that the family members were under tension over a proposal of buying a new house. they had recently sold their old house in haripura for rs 10 lakh, and owned several property in the city. all the dead bodies were found in a pool of blood on the first floor of their apartment in hathfaliya, and the manner in which they were killed was so gruesome that it seems only a maniac could have committed such an act, according to investigating officials. arvind might have hit very hard on the heads of the victims with the wooden plank used for washing clothes, the police said. according to deputy commissioner of police (north) a k pandya, three chits were found from the pocket of arvindbhai, who was last seen by some of his neighbours at around 10 am on wednesday. in the chits, he had asked his brother to take care of his children if they were found alive and requested him not to send them to any orphanage. he had also given the details of all his property, pandya said. surprisingly, arvind was a soft spoken man and had never picked up any quarrel with anyone, and the family was also well-off. all the bodies have been sent to the new civil hospital for post-mortem. the police are yet to ascertain the cause behind arvindbhai taking this extreme step.

14,Chhatisgarh to enforce terror law,"raipur: not withstanding the congress opposition to prevention of terrorism ordinance (poto), the ajit jogi government in chhatisgarh will enforce the provisions of poto, state director general of police r.l.s yadav, said here on thursday. speaking to tnn, yadav said the state government has decided to invoke the provisions of poto to curb the menace of naxalites. he said the pwg carried out three violent acts on thursday, soon after the centre banned it. the pwg damaged a block office in dantewara with dynamites, vandalised the statue of mahatma gandhi at konta and caused an explosion in a busy market place. however, none was injured. the dantewara, baster and bijapur district police, where the three incidents took place have so far applied the provisions of the normal law, but the state police were considering invoking the provisions of poto as explosions had been carried out, yadav said. he said the madhya pradesh government had recommended the ban on the pwg in 1998, but the centre had delayed it and on wednesday, the centre decided to ban the pwg under poto. though no arrests have been carried out or have any offices been sealed so far, yadav did not rule out a crackdown on the organisation's leaders. the pwg gave a call for bastar bandh on thursday in protest against poto. according to the dg, the bandh elicited mixed response. it's impact was not felt in the urban areas, but naxalites blocked road traffic in various rural areas. the bandh affected normal life in bastar, bijapur, kanker, dantewra districts and particularly in kondagaon, narayanpur, dhanora, bhanupratappur, orcha and parvanjad areas, where vehicular traffic was suspended. the dg said four naxalites were killed in an encounter with the police in bhopalpattnam on wednesday. those killed included an area commander, shankar, who had masterminded the explosion of the vehicle of an additional sp last month. no policeman was injured, according to yadav.

15,Bill against domestic violence,"new delhi: the domestic violence prevention bill, approved by the cabinet for its introduction in parliament, proposes the creation of protection officers (pos) by state governments who would act on the complaints of wives against husbands. protection officers would call upon an erring husband and counsel him on how to make his wife happy when the latter complains of being subjected to violence at home, proposes the bill in a bid to keep the police off skirmishes among couples. ""the first task on the hands of these officers would be to solve the matter amicably by counselling the husband,"" law ministry sources said on thursday. the pos would be drawn mainly from among social workers, activists and judicial officers, the sources said, adding the bill would meet a long standing demand from women organisations for a legislation to prevent domestic violence. if the counselling does not resolve matters, the woman would have the right to approach the local area magistrate empowered to order for her protection, they said. if the problem continues further the magistrate was empowered to proceed with a complaint under section 125 of the criminal procedure code (crpc), the sources said. section 125 empowers courts to direct husbands or relatives to pay maintenance to the women on various grounds during the pendency of a divorce petition. the government had recently enhanced the maintenance limit. however, sources said the main objective of the bill was to keep the police off family disputes arising from domestic violence at the first instance with the hope that counselling would reform the husband. the draft bill was prepared by the national commission for women (ncw). various ngos have been lobbying for such a legislation on the ground that more than 40 per cent of women were victims of such violence. recognising domestic violence as a human rights violation and serious deterrent to development, india became a signatory to the 1994 vienna accord and the beijing platform of action of 1995. several countries like australia, new zealand, britain, us, south africa and malaysia have enacted similar laws.

19,"Temple first priority, not govt: RSS","new delhi: the rashtriya swyamsevak sangh on thursday ruled out any immediate threat to the bjp-led government at the centre, but made it clear that if it came to a choice, the ayodhya temple would take priority over all else. in a more moderate tone than fellow-sangh-parivar outfit vishwa hindu parishad, but firm nevertheless, rss spokesman m.g. vaidya told reporters here that ""the aim for us is the ram temple. stability or instability of the government is the concern of the party."" the rss, he said, had it's own agenda and the ram temple was the priority. the vhp has said the bjp-led government will be in jeopardy if temple construction fails to come about. vaidya, however, said the rss believed the government was trying to finding a solution to the vexed issue by march next year. ""we don't find any reason not to trust the prime minister,"" he said. the rss general counsel would only discuss after the march 12 deadline what the vhp had in mind. a decision on the issue would be made known at its meeting in march in bangalore. the rss had decided to support all vhp plans on implementation of temple construction until march 12, 2002, the deadline set by the parivar for beginning construction of the temple at ayodhya. the vhp launched a massive movement in september to garner public support. the programme will continue as a build-up to the construction of the temple. vaidya said the rss might join a vhp delegation to meet the prime minister and ask him to remove obstacles in the way of temple construction after a ""sant yatra"" arrived in the capital on january 27 next. the sangh leader said there were three possible solutions to the ayodhya problem: a court decision before 12 march; a compromise between owners of the disputed land and the ram janmabhoomi trust, or the handing over to the vhp of undisputed land acquired by the government so that construction could begin there. seeking to allay fears on another spate of communal violence on the issue, vaidya said what had happened before had been in reaction. ""we ignore the action which causes the reaction"", he said. the ram temple, he asserted, ""is a most secular activity"" and so was ""the demolition of the disputed structure a secular act because it was not a mosque. it was a symbol of religious vandalism."" also still priority on agenda, he reiterated, were the kashi and mathura temples, though he refused to put a time-frame on the matter, saying even in the case of ayodhya, ""the rss did not start the agitation, only supported the vhp agitation.""
