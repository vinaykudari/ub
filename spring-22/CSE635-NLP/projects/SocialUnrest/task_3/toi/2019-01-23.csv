1,Cong condemns Sena chief's remarks at rally,"mumbai: the mumbai regional congress committee (mrcc) on monday condemned shiv sena chief bal thackeray for hurling abuses at senior bureaucrats who had helped expose corruption in high offices. the congress also deplored the ``derogatory'' references made by the sena chief against the reservation policy for for dalits and women, at a public rally held by the sena- bjp leaders on sunday. ``the abusive language used by mr thackeray against s.s. tinaikar and nand lal, who had probed corruption in the mumbai and thane municipal corporations respectively, is unpardonable. but what is surprising is that it was made in the presence of union home minister l.k. advani,'' said tushar gandhi, mrcc spokesperson. ``it is shocking that mr advani should choose to be a silent spectator when mr thackeray let loose his tongue and hurled abuses at one and all,'' he said. ``mr thackeray had deplored the age-old policy of reservations for the minorities and the dalits. it clearly shows that he is against the dalits and minorities,'' mr gandhi said.

3,Huge Cong rally in BJP citadel,"shimla: the turnout at the recent congress rally at kangra, said to be the citadel of the bjp, may have enthused a section of party workers and leaders of himachal pradesh, where elections are slated early next year, but it has further widened the chasm between the two warring factions of the party. that the rally minus the two former chief ministers, who were also to be the star speakers,virbhadra singh and ram lal, was still a resounding success, should give ruling bjp in the state something to think about, not only because it was held at its citadel, but also the fact that of the 16 mlas that kangra district has, 11 are of the bjp, and an independent is also supporting the party. but it is not only the bjp that will be worried. equally concerned will be former chief minister virbhadra singh who has shied away from most of the meetings of the hpcc chief on some pretext or the other. it is not only he who has abstained, but most of his ardent supporters have also been conspicuous by their absence. singh had not only himself abstained from the rally on the plea that the invitation to him was an afterthought, after the matter had been raked up in the media, but most of his ardent loyalists, including all india mahila congress president and rajya sabha member chandresh kumari, chander kumar,b b l butail and asha kumari, all mlas, were also not present at the rally. the fact that some of those who had tried to remain neutral within the party, calling themselves ''fence-sitters, awaiting which faction got the better of the other visa-vis the party high command before taking sides, also attended the kangra rally of the hpcc chief, will also come as a setback to the virbhadra faction. supporters of the hpcc chief were all gaga at the resounding success of the rally, more so because of the fact some of the rallies held by the faction in the past had not been so successful. ''those who have always said that no congress rally in the state can be successful without their presence have been proved wrong,they said, beaming with the newly gained confidence. however, supporters of virbhadra singh reacted differently, claiming that the success of the rally was not a very positive development for the hpcc chief, as whatever success was achieved at the rally was because of the negative working and wrong policies of the present bjp government in the state. they said that singh himself was perhaps the most loyal congressman, which was evident from the fact that when the congress split way back in the 70s and many prominent congressmen of the state shied away from the party, it was the former chief minister who kept the congress going by opening the party office at his personal residence. despite all this, the hpcc and some party leaders have been trying to humble and humiliate him, by taking disciplinary steps against some of his ardent supporters and expelling them from the party on the slightest pretext. his supporters said that they were all for unity within the party, but unity could not be one-sided, with such brash actions as were being taken by the hpcc.''the wrongs will have to be undone and stokes should take the initiative in this regard to show that she is concerned about party unity, they added.

4,Sex scam casts shadow over Cong in Nagpur civic polls,"nagpur: murky politics and in fighting have cast a shadow on the congress in the run-up to the february 10 nagpur municipal corporation elections. this became light when prominent congress leaders stayed out of the formal launch of the campaign by party joint secretary shivlal valmiki. mr valmiki arrived from delhi on monday ostensibly for the launch of the party's civic poll campaign. but his visit, party sources believe, was more of a fire-fighting effort by aicc in-charge of maharashtra motilal vora. the infighting, which touched its peak barely three weeks before the poll, tainted the party image when office-bearer of the party's women wing kalpana phulbandhe levelled indirect charges of sexual harassment against two senior leaders. last week she went public with her allegations that she and several other woman aspirants for party tickets had received telephone calls from persons claiming to be personal assistants of state textile minister satish chaturvedi and party mp vilas muttemwar. ``we received these calls after our interviews by the selection board and the callers clearly suggested that we must please their bosses with sexual favours if we wanted the party ticket, she first told a private tv channel. however, she said she had neither taken up the matter with the police, party higher- ups or even with the two leaders whose staffers, she claimed, made the obscene calls. later, she promptly went round all newspaper offices with a written retraction of her charges against the two leaders. although she admitted in her statement that her `outbursts against the senior leaders were out of her frustration on being denied the ticket and that she was repentant that it caused unintended damage to the party, it was clear that her retraction came a bit too late. the opposition, notably the nationalist congress party, a `friend turned-foe' in the civic elections has capitalised on the issue. ncp leader and deputy chief minister chhagan bhujbal,launching his party's campaign, did not forget to lampoon the congress over the phulbandhe episode in his inimitable style. the ncp, which has struck an alliance with two rpi factions, and the lokmanch is trying to project itself the best choice over a scam-tainted bjp and an `immoral congress'. a government appointed committee had indicted several bjp corporators earlier. the two congress leaders in the thick of the controversy say their rivals in the party have unfairly targeted them. mr chaturvedi and mr muttemwar have completely dominated the party affairs here and were at daggers drawn with the rival group comprising former mp banwarilal purohit, minister of state anees ahmed and mla nitin raut over the constitution of the new city unit of the party headed by sheikh hussain. it is this dissident group that is credited with keeping the phulbandhe episode alive even after her written statement seeking public apology for defaming the party and the two leaders. the damage-control measures by mr valmiki seem to have failed as all the dissident leaders kept away from the campaign launch function. the delhi emissary could do little beyond exhorting the party workers to sink differences and to urge those were denied the party ticket to forgive and forget.

5,Dispute over rules delays slum demolition,"mumbai: the demolition of the mohammed rafi nagar slums near chhattrapati shivaji international airport has been delayed by a dispute over the criteria adopted by an ngo in identifying the tenements that were built before 1995. the ngo __ called the society for the promotion of area resource centres or sparc __ and the national slum dwellers' federation has identified 2,116 hutments at mohammed rafi nagar as having been existed before 1995, which entitles the residents to alternative housing from the government. but the housing department claimed that according to the criteria specified by the government, only about 1,100 mohammed rafi nagar hutments existed pre-1995. the airports authority of india has deemed the demolition of the slums a top priority because of its uncomfortable proximity to the airport and because of a proposed expansion of the runway. the minister of state for housing, nawab malik, told this newspaper that the government was waiting for rehabilitation facilities to be completed before proceeding with the demolition. however, the shiv shahi punarvasan prakalp, which is in charge of providing the alternative homes, has already earmarked 2,116 out of 2,614 tenements already constructed at dindoshi for the families of the rafi nagar slums. ``these families can be shifted to dindoshi tomorrow if necessary,'' a source said. this person said that the 225-sq-foot tenements already have water and power connections. the controversy doesn't hinge on the availability of accommodation but on the number of families eligible. because the rafi nafar slums are on a central government plot, they were excluded from a survey conducted by the state government a few years ago. subsequently, in a departure from standard practice, the state government in the mid-nineties asked sparc to carry out a survey of rafi nagar. but the sparc survey is now being contested by the state government, citing its rule that only people with a ration card or named on the voters' list can qualify for a house. in addition, a community development officer has to certify that the structure was built before 1995. however, community development officers say that sparc hasn't followed the government's criteria and has listed slum dwellers as eligible for rehabilitation even if they produced driving licences or if their names were mentioned in police records. the community development officers took up the matter with the state government's slum rehabilitation authority, which forwarded the dispute to the housing department. since then, the matter has been in cold storage because the government is not keen to cut down the list and antagonise a potential voters in the run-up to the civic elections. the area is represented by kripashankar singh of the congress. ``there is no question of giving in to sparc on this score,'' a state government official asserted. ``the issue is not merely whether sparc followed our guidelines but about the needless expenditure we will incur if we have to accept all the people who are not originally entitled to the benefits.'' at the rate of rs 5 lakh per tenement, the cost of rehabilitating the slum dwellers will shoot up tremendously if people who don't meet government-mandated norms are given houses, he said. sparc, on the other hand, has denied that it has used invalid criteria toidentify eligible slumdwellers. a. jockin, president of the nsdf, says a government resolution has decreed that a voters identity cards cannot be treated as the sole proof of residence. ``thirty per cent citizens don't have voter id cards. how can they all be ignored?'' he asks. he says that the resolution lists 13 other documents, including driver's licences and birth certificates, that are acceptable as proof of residential status. in addition to rafi nagar, there is a similar conflict over the status of the sanjay gandhi nagar slums on the outer periphery of the airport near the priority. about 400 out of the 800-odd huts in the area were razed in a surprise demolition last december. the demolition was eventually stayed. while the government claims the entire slum is illegal, mr jockin said about 480 of these structures were built before 1995.

6,"Parties, candidates fume over EC rules","mumbai: `put a lid on it' is the message that the election code of conduct is striving to convey to political parties and candidates for the february 10 civic elections. no loudspeakers after 10 pm, no loudspeakers without prior permission during the day, no aspect of a candidate's private life to be criticised, no distribution of liquor to influence voters are some of the rules laid down by state election commission. all this may be fine enough. but what about the strictures that ``processionists shall not carry any articles which are capable of being misused as missiles or weapons.'' given that even an innocuous hawai chappal or a potato can be turned into a formidable missile by capable hands, activists could be hauled up for possession of almost anything. indeed, parties and candidates are fuming over several of the strictures imposed under the guise of code of conduct, which they claim are either impractical or totally meaningless. on monday, in the civic standing committee, members cutting across party lines raised objections to some of the do's and don'ts of the code of conduct. the bjp, already bristling under the ec's ban on propaganda through the sms (short messaging service) on mobile phones, is even more outraged at the fee of rs 300 per padayatra and the reams of paperwork that needs to be in place before a candidate can walk out for a `prachar'. bjp's mumbai president vinod tawde says, ``sms and e-mail are being perceived as part of electronic media. our outlook is different. for us, these tools come under the service sector and a ban on their usage is unfair. what if someone sends an sms on my name and it is floated around? i might just end up being penalised for no fault of mine.'' sena corporator chandrakant wadkar feels that section 144 of the crpc which has been imposed on the city be lifted. this section prevents assembly of more than five persons in public places. ``how do we stop people from joining our padayatras?'' asks mr wadkar. parties also claim that the authorities do not uniformly impose these codes of conduct and that some candidates are penalised while others get away scot free. for instance, samajwadi party corporator nasser jamal says, ``when our candidates go on a door-to-door campaign, they are not allowed to be accompanied by more than five persons, but candidates of other parties openly move with huge groups.'' he noted that at a recent public meeting organised by the sp, the nagpada police invoked the rule prohibiting casteist and communal comments and warned the party against making any reference to the malegaon riots. ``but when bal thackeray talked about cutting subsidies given to hajis or growing criminal activities in mumbra, nobody stopped him,'' says mr jamal. mr tawde has objections to the rule which states that a no objection certificate (noc) should be secured from an individual before erecting a flag at his premises. ``now if a bjp worker wants to put a flag in his house, he has to give an noc to the party, which will then submit the certificate to the police. this involves unnecessary paperwork and red tape,'' mr tawde says. ``the police should just be asked to take action if a person has objection over the use of his premises for campaigning. but when there is no problem why should we go through time-consuming paperwork?'' he asks. bjp corporator gopal shetty feels that civic officers often misinterpret the code of conduct. he cited the example of a corporator who always accompanied civic officers to a site if he received some complaint from a resident. ``but now, the officials refuse to go with him, claiming it is against the code,'' says mr shetty. however, the civic administration on monday clarified that day-to-day work of a corporator will not be affected by the code of conduct.

8,Powerlooms sulk at govt apathy,"surat: the politics of power (read tariff issue) has become murkier with nothing in the offing even after three weeks of the strike, causing loss in several hundreds of crores. after chief minister narendra modi refused to meet them during a 'maha' rally by 30,000 weavers on monday at gandhinagar, things have taken a different shape. it is a battle against the government's rigid stance with an attitude of ""who cares"", said the rallyists. the thousands of weavers would take the matter to the people, with a message to unite against the government apathy to even give them a hearing, said federation of gujarat weavers association (fogwa) president manubhai patel. on his return from gandhinagar, he said they were not against chief minister modi but they resented the way his government viewed the issue. they were ready to discuss with modi but he was dogged by vested political considerations. refuting the state government claim that 30 per cent deferment as granted by the keshubhai regime last august did not pertain to any subsidy, fogwa general secretary yogesh mehra said the government in its affidavit to gujarat electricity commission regulatory (gerc) on september 9, had concluded that the gerc might consider softer approach in determining power rate for the powerloom sector so that individual units might get relief up to 30 per cent of the total billing. besides, a government-led delegation, including representatives of fogwa, made a study tour of maharashtra, karanataka, tamil nadu and andhra pradesh during september-october last year to study the power tariff and financial aid given to the powerloom sector and filed a report. about the government contention that others could seek subsidy if the same was granted to the powerloom sector, mehra said, ""in the affidavit then it had been stated that the industries not falling within the purview of the employment oriented ones, relief in power tariff should not be given and on that basis the petition of the southern gujarat texturising association had been rejected"". on the other hand, powerloom sector is job-oriented. so it has been bracketed with the agricultural sector for grant of relief in power tariff in maharashtra, mehra said. meanwhile, fogwa on tuesday evening charted out a course of action which included mass contact at district levels to apprise the public of state government's apathy. there was nothing for them to assemble at rajkot on poll eve to ensure modi's defeat. ""we are not fighting against modi. our endeavour is to save the industry from disaster. so the question of settling the score at personal level does not arise, fogwa president patel told tnn.

23,Farmers' rally in Mysore on Jan. 30,"gulbarga: the karnataka rajya raitha sangha (puttannaiah group) has demanded that the karnataka government constitute a pulse board, maize board, coconut board and paddy board. k.s. puttannaiah, president of krrs said here on tuesday, the organisation would adopt a resolution at the state-level rally of the rajya raitha sangha to be held in mysore on january 30 at the town hall grounds. puttannaiah told reporters that the rally aimed at putting an end to farmers suicides and supporting those in distress. kishan pattnayaka, all india farmers leader from orissa will inaugurate the rally, he said. fixing a minimum support price (msp) for different agricultural products would benefit only the middlemen and not the farmers, he added. ``instead, the government should fix prices so that farmers do not suffer losses,'' he said. the president of krrs said, a paper regarding implementation of scientific methods in cultivation would be presented at the rally. he demanded the karnataka government allocate rs 1,600 crore for sprinkler irrigation in the state. puttannaiah criticised the karnataka chief minister krishna for relegating agriculture to a second slot and giving prominence to information technology. he said there was no mention of implementation of dwarakanath committee's report (appointed by the karnataka government) either in the governor's address or in the thanksgiving speech of the chief minister in the state assembly. there was no discussion about the farmers who sustained losses due to drought. the president of krrs demanded the government suspend loan recovery from farmers immediately or else they would start an agitation. he said there was no question of both factions of raita sanghas (puttannaiah group and nanjundaswammy group) coming together.

24,SC urged to haul up Karnataka govt,"shimoga: four senior advocates from shimoga bar, h.r.r. rao, d.p. wodeyar, h.m. aradya and k.m. murthy have filed a public interest litigation before the supreme court against the karnataka government alleging it had failed to carry out the sc direction relieving all candidates who have been appointed under the rural weightage benefit. according to the apex court direction, appointments made under the rural weightage after 11.11.98 are invalid and unconstitutional. though the karnataka high court has relieved judges from service in accordance with the sc direction, the state government has not taken any steps to either prepare a list of candidates without rural weightage to be considered for appointment nor have they relieved those who have been disqualified for appointment in the wake of the sc direction, even after three months. the state government is deliberately delaying the process which amounts to depriving the fundamental right of the deserving candidates who are under the merit students list, the pil contended. the petitioners asked the court to initiate contempt proceedings to uphold the sanctity of the judiciary.
