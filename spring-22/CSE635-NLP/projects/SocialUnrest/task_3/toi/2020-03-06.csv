0,Banks' MF investments under lens,"MUMBAI: Even as banks have started redeeming their mutual fund investments to spruce up their balance sheets by March-end, possible losses on their investments in short-term plans (STPs) of MFs has put RBI on alert.

Banks have invested over Rs 8,000 crore in STPs, which, in turn, have invested in not-so-liquid securities of NBFCs. RBI, which had even earlier voiced its apprehensions over these investments, now wants to know whether the banks have incurred losses in redeeming these units.

RBI officials were unavailable for comment on the issue, but a fund manager confided that short-term plans of MFs have been facing severe redemption pressure and that investments made in NBFC securities, in particular, have had to be liquidated at a discount.

""Since these securities are not traded frequently, funds have had to offer these securities at a discount to manage the redemption pressure,"" he added. This has resulted in lower net asset values for the schemes, though the losses are reportedly not very substantial.

STPs of mutual funds have invested over 10-15 per cent in these partly-liquid securities with an average maturity period of one year. ""STPs are designed to be liquid investments and so typically invest in one-year papers issued by NBFCs and corporates,"" said sources.

2,"Bananas facing extinction, feel experts","KOLKATA: Banana, the essential item on the breakfast table, could well be on its way to extinction within the next one decade in the absence of enough reproductive and pest-resistnant varieties of the species, scientists say.

Grown in dozens of varieties from the small sweet ones to large starchy ones across the world, particularly in tropical countries, the species has stopped reproducing thousands of years back, according to the latest ''â€™Environews'' published by the National Environmental Science Academy. ""The common varieties of the fruits are seedless, sterile mutant. As a result, banana now lacks the genetic diversity to fight off pests and diseases,"" the report, quoting eminent global agricultural scientists, said.

Believed to have been discovered around 10,000 years ago, the wild variety, scientifically called musa acuminata, the natural variety of banana initally contained hard seeds that made the plant virtually inedible until hunt-gatherers discovered the mutant variety which produced seedless edible fruits. ""Those fruits, as scientists have discovered now, have three copies of each chromosome instead of the usual two. That extra set of genes prevents their seeds from growing normally,"" the report said.

Threatened with a soil fungus attack that produces a wilt called Panama disease that wipes off acres of crop, the only option at hand was to create a new variety of the fruit, the report said. ""But that is an uphill task, as almost all the edible varieties are susceptible to diseases and don''t have much genetic variations to go for a new one,"" it added. The first commercial variety Gros Michel developed in the 1950s was abandoned by farmers some years later due to its severe vulnerability to Panama disease. Even the most popular variety in today''s market â€” the cavendish â€” has been increasingly threatened by the fungus, the report said. Breeders of the Honduran Foundation of Agricultural Research had recently handpollinated about 30,000 plants by collecting pollen from wild African varieties and searched for seeds in the resulting fruits.

""They got only 15 seeds in 400 tonnes of fruit, of which about five germinated. But these new bananas have been meeting consumer complaints because they taste more like apples,"" the report pointed out. Quoting David Mclaughlin, director of Chiquita, one of the biggest companies in the banana business, the report said improving the varieties on which the Africans depend for survival might be the right choice to save the fruit. A global project was needed to sequence the banana genome in order to identify the disease causing genes and to insert them in the commercial varieties by tissue culture had also been initiated, the report said.

3,City to ban display of political posters,"Kolkata: There are hard times ahead for political parties in the state. The Kolkata Municipal Corporation has decided to ban the display of roadside political banners, posters, festoons and cut-outs of political leaders as part of a â€˜clean Kolkataâ€™ drive. The civic body has also decided to pull down commercial hoarding from all major thoroughfares.

Mayor Subrata Mukherjee on Friday said he had already sent letters to leaders of all political parties urging them to abide by the norms as part of an endeavour to keep Kolkata clean. Mukherjee said initially civic employees would keep watch on thoroughfares like VIP Road and Eastern Metropolitan Bypass where, the mayor felt, roads were getting dirtier due to display of life-size cutouts of political leaders, banners and festoons of different political parties. Mukherjee said he was particularly worried over display of such banners and festoons in Paroma Island and in the island near Ruby General hospital on E.M. Bypass.

â€œThese are taking a toll on the reputation of Kolkata as a city of international standards. I have urged all political parties to refrain from such activities and I hope I wonâ€™t have to take harsh steps,â€� Mukherjee said. Mukherjee said after a number of people brought the matter to his notice, he decided to write to political parties. The KMC will also put a ban on display of political banners near statues of national heroes.

4,Fifth LF govt takes office in Tripura,"AGARTALA: The fifth Left Front ministry led by CPM politburo member Manik Sarkar assumed office on Friday morning in a colourful function at the sprawling Raj Bhavan garden. Governor Lt-Gen. (retd) K.M. Seth administered the oath to the 18-member Cabinet at 9.30 am.

The ministers took oath in English, Bengali and the tribal Kokborok languages. The Opposition Congress and Indigenous Nationalist Party of Tripura boycotted the swearingin ceremony alleging that post-poll violence had been let loose on them by the ruling party cadres. Former chief minister Nripen Chakrabarty, CPM politburo members Biman Bose, Prakash Karat, Sitaram Yechuri, other senior leaders of the Left Front and a galaxy of businessmen were present at the function.

In the 18-member ministry, there are a total of five tribal legislators and a lone woman MLA, Bijoy Laxmi Sinha, the widow of popular minister of the fourth Left Front government Bimal Sinha who was assassinated by the NLFT militants. Sources in the Left Front indicated that there would not be any major change in the portfolios of the ministers who had returned to the House.

However, some ministers of the fourth Left Front government who looked after more than three departments may find their portfolios distributed among the six newly inducted ministers. Chief minister Manik Sarkar termed the Opposition boycott of the ceremony as â€œunfortunate and undemocraticâ€�. A massive victory rally of the Left Front at the Astabal ground in the heart of Agartala town was held in the afternoon, where three CPM politburo members were present.
