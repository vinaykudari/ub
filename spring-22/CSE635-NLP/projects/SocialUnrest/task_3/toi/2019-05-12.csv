1,Protest against farm-waste based power plant,"CHITRADURGA: People of 32 villages in Hiriyur taluk are up in arms against the setting up of a farm waste based power generating unit that has secured permission from the government.

Sridhar, an environmentalist, said a Tamil Nadu based industrialist has purchased some 120 acres of land near Hiriyur for the purpose.

He wondered how the State Pollution Control Board gave its nod for it, since the unit would burn some 1,500 tonnes of farm wastes to produce 20 megawatts of power. He said the people would fight tooth and nail to stop the unit from operating.

2,Mobs clashes keep cops on their toes,"AHMEDABAD: A naked body with stab wounds was recovered from the Sabarmati banks on Saturday morning. Police said the middle-aged man was stabbed near the Ellisbridge and then dumped on the river bank.

Elsewhere in Ahmedabad, flames leapt out of a screen printing unit in Dani Limda, while a huge riotous mob rushed towards each others'' houses in the slums which was in the grip of communal strife on Saturday afternoon. Eleven persons were injured in the clash.

Stone, glass bottles filled with acid, petrol and other inflammables flew along with burning missiles through the air. Amidst all the din, as policemen paraded through the narrow alleys lining Dani Limda road, a shout rang out: ""Shut your cameras,"" -- an order from an official who has assumed charge only a day earlier.

The dictat was for the electronic-media persons, who were accompanying the huge posse at Dani Limda as two rioters were arrested from the site of violence. The official proceeded to wield the baton himself but became camera-shy while in action. The duo, both middle aged men, were spanked.

Fifteen shops and commercial establishments had been set on fire by miscreants in this area. As fire brigade personnel fought with the flames, policemen proceeded to break open doors of houses in Abadnagar and drag out suspected rioters amidst exchange of choicest of abuses.

The policemen then proceeded to their next stop -- Saptarishi no Aro on Sabarmati Banks near Sardar Bridge. The local firemen were the first to reach this spot along with their armed escorts when bomb blasts shattered the calm of the area. Groups clashed within this slum area and 30 houses were set on fire.

As fire brigade personnel struggled to get into the narrow lanes and bylanes of the thickly populated slum. A victim who had been hit by a stone was carried off on a stretcher. Another groaned as he walked with a bullet injury in his waist and the third limped with blood oozing from his left leg.

Just outside this locality once again the official shouted ""shut your cameras"" as he proceeded to spank two more rioters caught at the slum. A cameraman of a local channel almost drew a rebuke when he failed to comply.

Earlier in the day, action was at Raikhad Haveli which after arson and violence of Friday, carried on with heavy stone pelting and bomb explosions on Saturday. Two Vajra vehicles, several riot control vehicles, RAF personnel and policemen paraded in the Raikhad and Jamalpur areas and resorted to tear gas shelling to quell mobs bent on annihilation.

Later in the evening, some hutments near the Bhavan''s College in Khanpur were set ablaze by rioters as violence and arson re-erupted again in Dani Limda.

3,Stray violence in Hubli-Dharwad,"HUBLI/DHARWAD: The bandh call given by the BJP to protest against the hike in power tariff received mixed response in the twin cities with the commercial establishments in the main market areas remaining closed on Saturday.

However, business and life was normal in extension areas. The bandh was peaceful except for some stray incidents of stone-throwing. A NWKRTC bus driver sustained minor injuries in the incident.

The city bus service which had been operating since morning was withdrawn following stone-throwing. The day being second Saturday also added to the success of the bandh as it was a holiday for the government offices. Autorickshaws made some quick bucks while the city buses suspended operations.

The members of the BJP, led by Opposition leader Jagadish Shettar, Prahlad Joshi, Ashok Katwe, Ranga Baddi and others took out a procession in Hubli.

In Dharwad, the market wore a deserted look as the shops downed their shutters. The city bus service was suspended after the windowpanes of a bus was shattered due to stone-throwing near Laxmi Talkies. The outstation buses were plying as usual. The National Highway near Navalur bridge was blocked by the BJP workers for a while. Assistant Commissioner of Police Basavaraj Malagatti ensured that there were no untoward incidents.

4,Keshubhai turns down ministership,"GANDHINAGAR: Former state chief minister Keshubhai Patel is right now in no mood to accept a Cabinet post at the Centre. Setting aside all speculation that he being awarded a top ministerial portfolio by Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee, the former chief minister told TNN here on Saturday that his ""current priority is to improve health and for at least three months he is not going to accept any responsible position"".

Patel said, ""If I cannot fulfill a job assigned to me due to health reasons, what is the grand idea of accepting ministership?"" When asked whether any offer was made to him or not, Patel said, ""Indeed, feelers were sent to me. But I have turned them down on health grounds.""

He was just back from a health clinic at Madhusudan Ashram in Ahmedabad, about 20 km from here, where he takes treatment twice a week during his stay here.

Circles close to him, however, said the reason for Patel''s refusal to accept a ministerial berth under Vajpayee was ""political"". He has still not come to terms with the manner in which he was pushed out of chief ministership in October last. ""He doesn''t want to take any responsibility at a time when the high command cannot trust his advice on different political issues of Gujarat,"" said a top Patel protege.

Patel, now a Rajya Sabha MP, is learnt to have been offered ministership twice each by Vajpayee and Union home minister L K Advani. Every time the offer was made, he turned it down, saying he had lost all interest for a responsible post because of the past experience with the high command. He also cited health as a reason. Despite openly defending Modi, he is learnt to have expressed his reservations to the central BJP about the way Modi was dealing with the communal situation.

When asked what did he have to say about the induction of K P S Gill as Modi''s adviser, the former chief minister said, ""Gill has come at a time when the situation around was complex. He is a competent man with wide experience. One should not rush to any strong conclusions about him. Rather one should refrain from making adverse remarks. It would take about a fortnight for him to come to grips with the situation in Gujarat. I am sure, he will succeed.""

5,Traders slam govt policies,"LUCKNOW: The tradersâ€™ community on Saturday fired its first salvo against the Mayawati-led government, by accusing it of acting at complete cross purposes with the welfare of traders and threatened to launch a state-wide agitation against the government.

Announcing this at a press conference, Sandeep Bansal, state president of the UP Udyog Vyapar Mandal said that to highlight their problems and to draw the attention of the state government to their plight, they will hold protests at all district headquarters.

Accusing the state government of rolling back many of the promises of former chief minister Rajnath Singh, the traders lambasted the poor power situation in many parts of the state, primarily in the cities and townships, which are the industrial bases.

â€œIf this indifference continues, we would be compelled to launch a stir that could have serious consequences on the stability of the coalition government,â€� an office bearer said. Obliquely hinting at the fact that the BJP â€” relying on the trader community vote bank in a big way â€” is the key partner in the UP government, Bansal said they would be making a representation to BJP ministers Lalji Tandon and Ramveer Upadhyaya on May 13.

The traders have a major grouse against the trade tax department and the power department, which they allege, are haunting the honest traders for no fault of theirs. â€œEvery day new rules are being made, only to harass the traders who are bringing in the highest revenue for the state coffers,â€� said leaders.

â€œReckless lodging of FIRs and raids have rendered a body blow to the morale of the tradersâ€™ community,â€� Bansal added and said that until concrete measures were taken to restore their confidence, a confrontation with the state government was imminent.

The protest is likely to be an impressive show in districts like Kanpur, Gonda, Faizabad, Budayun, Gorakhpur, Mathura, Meerut, Jhansi, Varanasi, Agra, Pilibhit and Bareilly.

7,TOI story moves Gujarat govt official to act,"AHMEDABAD: In a rare and noble gesture, which should set an example to not only the bureaucracy but society at large, a senior government official has offered his entire monthâ€™s salary of around Rs 25,000 to a Muslim Sanskrit scholar who lost his treasure of ancient Hindu and Muslim scriptures when his house in Lunawada was burnt down.

Reacting to a news report in The Times of India earlier this week, the director of social welfare (other backward classes), K G Vanzara, said he was shocked to read that the library containing priceless books was damaged in the attack on the house of Mohammed Ilyan Hussain Sibhai during the riots.

â€˜â€˜My gesture is not to show any mercy to Sibahi but this is an act of showing solidarity with him as I am also a lover of books,â€™â€™ said Vanzara, who wrote to The Times office with the offer.

He said it was striking that Sibhai has expressed his sorrow not for the loss of his house but for the loss of his personal library which was consisted of Vedas, Puranas, Upanishads and Bhagvat Gita, Ramayan and Mahabharat and several other very rare manuscripts in Sanskrit.

Though Sibhai is basically a teacher of mathematics, he obtained degree of Acharya (post graduate) in Sanskrit and teaching of Sanskrit is his passion.

Vanzara said: â€˜â€˜I am a lover of books and I have thousands of rare books in Sanskrit, Persian and Arabic in my personal library. I have made this collection in the last 25 years. I understand the obsession of books which is generally found in the scholars. I can feel the sorrow, helplessness and anguish of Mohammed Sibhai. For each single rare book of my library, sometimes I have travelled hundreds of miles to reach to the shop or the person where the desired book could be available.â€™â€™

The official, who is of deputy secretary rank in the government, said those who destroyed the library of Sibhai can only be compared with the Mohammed Bin Bakthiyar Khalji who destroyed the library of Nalanda Vidhyapith wherein one lakh rare Sanskrit and Pali manuscripts were burnt to ashes. â€˜â€˜That was a great loss to the nation and mankind. Persons like Sibhai are an asset to the society.â€™â€™

In such a situation as an ardent student of Sanskrit literature, Hindu scripture, Koran Majid and Islamic scripture, Vanzara said: â€˜â€˜I extend my heartfelt sympathy, love and solidarity with Mohammed Sibhai and offer my one monthâ€™s income which is approximately Rs 25,000 to Sibhai to rebuild his personal library. If he desires and gives me the list of books which have perished, I will purchase for him. I am ready to extend all possible help and co-operation within my resources to resettle Sibhai in Khanpur (Lunawada) from where he is dislocated. As I do not know Sibhai directly, I make this offer through The Times of India.â€™â€™

8,IPS cadre takes it with a pinch of salt,"LUCKNOW: In a trend-setting decision UP chief minister Mayawati appointed an IPS officerâ€”-IG, radio, Kashmir Singh â€”as a secretary in her fifth floor office in the Secretariat Annexe. By any measure, it is a plum posting for Kashmir Singh, who becomes the first IPS officer to occupy the post of the CMâ€™s secretary. The CM has a principal secretary and two secretaries, all from the IAS cadre.

Although Singhâ€™s ascendance to prominence has not come as surprise as his proximity to Behenji is well known in the bureaucratic circles, his posting is significant as it opens a new vista for the entire IPS cadre and breaks IAS monopoly. â€œThe IPS cadre has welcomed the move with no voice of dissent,â€� admitted a senior officer who is also a former office-bearer of the IPS association. â€œThis is the first appointment of an IPS officer on the post and this precedent will now have to be followed by other CMs as well,â€� he elaborated.

â€œEarlier, after years of persuasion we got the post of secretary in the state home department .We then pressed for secretary to CMâ€™s post,â€� elucidated another officer recalling how during the last Police Week the then chief minister Rajnath Singh had assured that the modalities for CM secretaryâ€™s post to an IPS officer would be worked out soon. Little wonder, it was during the last Presidentâ€™s Rule in the state that an IPS officer was appointed advisor to the governor. And after the change of guard, Mayawati has appointed an IPS on this post. Though the new post is believed to have opened a direct channel between the CM and the police, the IAS lobby has not welcomed the move. Till now any communication from the state police force was bound to go through either principal secretary (home) or the chief secretary. The IAS cadre was mum if not stunned, when some of the officials were contacted for comment. With a secretary from their cadres, the IPS officials would now be able to convey their grievances directly to the CM and would not need an IAS to take pity on them and push their issues, feel the IPS.

However,the appointment of Kashmir Singh has also left many IPS officers red faced.

â€œIt is not the appointment of an IPS officer but a Yes Man which Bahenji wanted around her,â€� rued a senior IPS officer. â€œKashmir Singh has been flouting his proximity with Mayawati during her earlier regimes so much so that he had left many a senior official displeased by his behaviour,â€� commented another top police officer. Kashmir Singh, by his appointment, has become more of a party flag-bearer than a secretary to the chief minister,rued another official.

â€œWe have not forgotten the past when the protocol was thrown to the winds. This man used to convene meetings at his office and senior officials were directed to come down to attend them,â€� recollected another senior officer pointing out how Singh was even referred to as the mini DGP.

Words doing the rounds during the recent Golf Club election controversy state how Singh had flaunted his connections with Mayawati to see himself as a winner.

9,'VHP misusing temple issue to fuel riots',"NEW DELHI: Charging senior VHP leaders with misusing the Ram Temple movement â€˜â€˜for engineeringâ€™â€™ communal riots, Ram Janambhoomi Nyas chief trustee Baba Dharam Dass on Saturday set up a body comprising Hindus and Muslims for the construction of the Ram temple.

Dass, who has been sidelined by the VHP on the temple issue, specifically accused VHP international working president Ashok Singhal, its president Vishnu Hari Dalmia and trust president Mahant Paramhans Ramchandra Das of â€˜â€˜misuse of funds meant for temple construction and undemocratic functioning.â€™â€™

â€˜â€˜Over Rs 2 crore were withdrawn for temple construction but instead of construction, a carved stone was donated. While it was the trust that was to decide on the date for beginning the construction work, these leaders unilaterally announced March 15 and it ended in a fiasco,â€™â€™ Dass told reporters here.

â€˜â€˜The trust is supposed to pay for the temple priestâ€™s salary, rajbhog and food for pilgrims but they have not spent a single penny on them. It is not for the trust to bear the expenses of the temple movement,â€™â€™ he said, adding the VHP was â€˜â€˜engineering communal riots to gain political mileage.â€™â€™

Asked why after associating with VHP leaders for so long, he has chosen to rebel now, Dass said, â€˜â€˜Only after March 15, I came to know that the acquired land will never be given to the trust and hence it has to be disbanded.â€™â€™ VHP leaders were not available for comment.

Dass announced the setting up of Vishva Dharma Raksha Parishad for the construction of the temple in place of the existing Nyas (Trust). â€˜â€˜People from all communities including Muslims will be part of the new body. We want to build the temple in an atmosphere of goodwill. We do not want any riots between Hindus and Muslims,â€™â€™ he said.

Dass offered 10 acres from his personal land for the construction of a mosque in lieu of the disputed land and said he himself was ready to take part in laying its foundation. He demanded that the trust should be dissolved forthwith and its accounts made public.

10,Workshop for govt departments’ problems,"HYDERABAD: The government will organise a two-day high level brainstorming workshop in which ministers, senior officials and heads of departments will discuss the problems and constraints being faced by various departments in achieving the targets set for them as part of the Development Monitoring Indicators (DMIs).

This will be followed up with a two-day conference of district collectors. The entire exercise will be replicated down to the mandal level.

The government has taken up the exercise to monitor 280 departments with reference to the implementation of projects and programmes requiring an expenditure of Rs 36,000 crore every year. As a run-up to this process, the government has evolved the DMI mechanism for all departments with chief minister Chandrababu Naidu personally supervising the performance of each department and fixing targets.

According to official sources, the 280 departments finalised their action plans with reference to the Ninth Five Year Plan and their achievements in comparison with the five best performing states in different fields, district-wise achievements of last year, targets for the Tenth Five Year Plan and for the current year with details of the constraints and problems in achieving them, if any.

Naidu who spent nearly 70 hours reviewing the action plans from April 1 to May 8, has asked the departments to submit revised action plans with monthly and quarterly district-wise targets. He also wanted them to come up with solutions to the problems.

Top official sources told The Times of India that eight groups would be constituted with each comprising a minister, secretary and 35 HODs to discuss the problems being encountered by various departments during the workshop.

Based on their recommendations, the government will issue orders and the impact will be studied during the next quarter.

In the subsequent meetings, collectors and ministers will disaggregate the targets and fix them up to the mandal level. Subsequently, the finer details will be worked out as how to achieve the targets at the mandal level. Officials from each department will visit states which had performed well in different fields and make a study of their strong and weak points.

11,City’s old development plans displayed,"HYDERABAD: Records of the cityâ€™s development, maintained meticulously by engineer Chandulal Dangoria of the City Improvement Board (CIB) during the reign of the seventh Nizam in 1918, were displayed at the Salar Jung Museum by his son Dhiraj Dangoria on Saturday.

Delivering a lecture on â€˜Hyderabad in Retrospectâ€™ at the museum, Dangoria showed records pertaining to the development plans of 23 localities, including rivers, parks and markets in the city â€” covering an area of 1,135 acres and the development of open land at a cost of Rs 77,92,886.

The records kept by CIB, then known as the Araish-e-Balda, spanned a period of 28 years between 1912 to 1940. This was the period following the 1908 floods and the 1911 plague. â€œA lot had been done for the development of the city during that period,â€� he said. The CIB was later merged with the housing corporation and the Bajris-e-Balda. Highlighting some of CIBâ€™s activities, he said the parks at Osmania Hospital, Moghulpura, Malakpet and the river banks at Nayapul and Muslimganjpul were developed by it.

Historical Society of Hyderabad (HSH) chairperson Dr Haripriya Rangarajan felicitated Dangoria. HSH secretary Rani Sarma said the city should be built in consonance with traditional aesthetics. â€œThe Heritage Conservation Committee and NGOs should think on such lines, rather than superimpose a Malaysian or Singapore model on the Old City,â€� she said.

12,Congress not averse to heading a coalition govt: Arjun Singh,"NEW DELHI: Senior Congress leader Arjun Singh has said that the party is not averse to heading a coalition at the Centre though its first aim is to capture power on its own.

He also feels that secular parties are the natural allies of the Congress and the third front is also ""not rigid"" about the party now.

""We decided at Pachmarhi that coalition is not our first aim. The party should strengthen itself so that it can achieve the position of eminence. We will definitely like that to happen. â€œ

""We also should realise sometimes we cannot achieve on our own. The party will definitely create an alternative"", senior Congress leader Arjun Singh said in an interview ahead of the crucial AICC session to be held here later this month.

Asked whether Congress would favour a coalition at the Centre, he said ""it is possible"".

To a query as to who were its natural allies, Singh said ""secular parties are our natural allies"".

On the Third front comprising the left parties and the Samajwadi party, he said ""let the situation unwind itself. I think it (front) is not as rigid as it was"".

Singh, however, indicated the party still has reservations about tying up with DMK in Tamil Nadu.

He made it clear that the Congress was not in the game of destabilisation of the Vajpayee Government.

""We are not making any conscious effort to destabilise the Government. I don''t see any major threat to the Government. We would like the Government to continue so that we are able to say something at the end of it what they could do or could not do"", Singh, who is a Congress Working Committee member said.

Asked whether it was a case of ""once bitten, twice shy"", he shot back: It is a matter of policy.

At the same time, he said when political alignments are made without any ideology and which are tenuous, then the coalition is bound to get ""looser and looser"" as the allies would feel that their long range interests were not being served politically by the alliance.

13,FICCI asks govt to abolish 10% purchase preference for PSUs,"NEW DELHI: Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) has urged the Government to do away with the 10 per cent purchase preference for products of public sector companies to provide a level playing field to the private players and to be in line by with the WTO rules.

""The need is to eliminate such measures and allow both private and public sector enterprises to operate and compete in an equitable manner,"" FICCI said in a statement on Sunday.

The chamber said if discontinuation is not possible completely, then the same could be amended by applying the purchase preference only on the indigenous value addition done by the PSUs and not on the entire project value subject to measure in terms of the project value.

""In view of the pressure on margin due to a preference level of 10 per cent on the private sector, the purchase preference should be reduced to a maximum of 3-4 per cent"", the statement said.

17,Council polls: Anti-Patil group gets active,"BANGALORE\HUBLI: Even as moves are afoot to work out a ``mutually beneficial'''' arrangement between the Congress and Janata Dal for the upcoming Council elections, a section of rebel Congressmen are set to support a JD (S)- supported independent against Water Resources Minister H.K. Patil.

Congress sources told The Times of India that Patil''s re-election will face hitches due to caste equations (Patil is a Naamdaari Reddy), because the Lingayat vote was turning against him. Of the 69,000 voters of the West Graduates constituency, 30,000 are Lingayats while Patil''s perceived Brahmin support base is 25,000.

``The anti-Patil lobby will support former Dharwad district president of State Government Employees Association Hemachandra Yeledahalli (Lingayat) who is being propped up by the JD(S),'''' sources stated.

The situation is further complicated for Patil by independent candidate P.S. Shoorapalli (Brahmin), a former Hubli-Dharwad Development Authority Chairman, who may cut into Patil''s vote base.

But the proposed ``arrangement'''' between the Janata Parivar and the Congress over support to the JD candidate from the Assembly to the Council may work in Patil''s favour, sources said. ``The JD, which might field Basavaraj Rayaraddi, will fall short of six seats and need Congress support. They may in return, help Patil win,'''' sources added.

Meanwhile, at a press conference in Bangalore, Yeledahalli accused Patil of enrolling fake names in the Graduates constituency voting list. ``I mailed an appeal letter to all 69,000 voters of which I got 6,440 mails back on the grounds that either the addresses were incomplete or that such persons did not live there. Since the list was revised only three months ago, how can this happen unless a conscious attempt has been made to tamper with it?'''' he asked.

Yeledahallli said Patil had also not concerned himself with the problems of the graduates whom he represents and so had to be replaced.

18,CPM flays UP govt action on CPI-ML rally,"KOLKATA: The CPM on Sunday condemned the violence unleashed by the police on CPI-ML rallies in Ayodhya. In a statement, CPM state secretary Anil Biswas deplored the â€˜undemocraticâ€™ actions by the newly-installed BSPBJP coalition government in UP.

Gujarat seems to be a catalyst for greater Left unity. Last month, extreme Left parties including the SUCI, often critical of the Left Front government, were asked to join a rally against communalism organised by the ruling front.

LF chairman Biman Bose stressed on further coordination against all kinds of fundamentalism.

The CPI-ML (Liberation), which will hold demonstrations against both Mayawati and BJP in Delhi and Kolkata on Monday, urged bigger Left parties for a joint nation-wide campaign against â€˜communal fascistsâ€™.

CPI-ML spokesman Anirban Chakraborty said that the party launched a campaign to popularise the demand to make a national martyrsâ€™ memorial at the disputed site in Ayodhya in memory of the participants in the 1857 mutiny.

Both Hindus and Muslims went to the gallows in the first strug-gle for independence against the British Raj.

On May 10, the UP government prevented the partyâ€™s frontal organisa-tions to hold a meeting in Ayodhya.A protest march invited further po-lice ire and more than one thousand activists were arrested.

Para-military forces of Uttar Pradesh encircled the convention at Faizabad Press Club Saturday.

As the organisers were about to leave, the police barged into the place and assaulted the participants towards the end of the meeting.

Senior teacher from Jawaharlal Nehru University Subhendu Ghosh, too, was not spared. Six were arrested from the spot.
