0,Maharashtra govt okays CBI probe,"NAGPUR: The Maharashtra government agreed on Tuesday to let the CBI probe the multi-crore fake stamp paper scam.

Replying to a marathon debate on the scam, deputy chief minister Chhagan Bhujbal told the state assembly here that the decision was taken after chief minister Sushilkumar Shinde consulted the law and judiciary department. He said the government will give its opinion to the Mumbai High Court, which is supervising the probe in the state.

Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani had asked the state government to let the CBI handle the probe, saying the racket had national ramifications and that Pakistan was possibly involved in it. The debate was initiated by the Shiv Sena-BJP opposition which wanted Bhujbalâ€™s resignation. Speaker Arun Gujarathi suspended question hour so that the debate could be taken up.

It began with a 90-minute fiery attack on Bhujbal and the government by opposition head Narayan Rane. Rane held Bhujbal responsible for the scam and the minuses in the investigation. Meanwhile, the Special Investigating Team has arrested inspector K K Parmar of Mumbai police for allegedly conniving with scam kingpin Telgi. He has been remanded to police custody till December 15.

1,‘HC deadline on old trucks may hit city food supplies’,"MUMBAI: Truck owners on Tuesday warned that the cityâ€™s supplies of food and vegetables are likely to suffer once the Bombay high court deadline for eight-year-old commercial heavy vehicles to stop plying on city roads expires on New Yearâ€™s Day.

According to orders issued by the high court in an ongoing case on vehicular pollution in Mumbai, eightyear-old commercial vehicles have to be phased out or converted to clean fuels like Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) by January 1, 2004. Even trucks and tempos registered outside the city cannot ply within city limits, unless they comply with the order.

â€œThis means that 60 to 70 per cent of the vehicles will not be able to enter Mumbai from the New Year, affecting the supply of vegetables, fruits, water, raw materials and finished goods,â€™â€™ said Niranjan Gehani, secretary of the Mumbai Vahatukdar Sangh at a press conference here.

He added that the phase-out would also lead to a humanitarian crisis since each truck employs three people and supports 12. Incidentally, about 24,000 15-yearold commercial vehicles have already been banned from the city roads since July this year.

Truckers said replacing so many vehicles with new ones which comply to Euro II pollution norms was too expensive-- a new vehicle costs between Rs 8 and 12 lakhsâ€”while the court had turned down the cheaper option of retrofitting Euro II engines on existing vehicles because of technical problems.

Meanwhile, since there are no CNG kits available on the market and no CNG available in other states, conversion to CNG is also not possible, truckers said.

â€œWe are in a jam,â€™â€™ said Mr Gehani, â€œThe fingers are always pointed at us that we want to pollute the city, but this is wrong. We are also staying in Mumbai and we are prepared to change but the infrastructure has to be there.â€™â€™

When asked why they waited so long to raise their issues, truck owners blamed the government and vehicle manufacturing industry for ignoring their problems.

â€œFor three years weâ€™ve been asking for CNG kits to be made available, for the retrofitment option or at least concessions from the government in terms of soft loans or sales tax cuts,â€™â€™ said S.K. Arora, another truck fleet owner.

â€œBut the government says it is broke and the manufacturers refuse to help us. They just want to sell new vehicles.â€™â€™

Truckers pointed out that not all eightyear-old vehicles are polluting, so instead of having a blanket ban, there should be fitness and pollution tests. Said Mr Gehani, â€œIf vehicles donâ€™t pass the test, they should certainly be banned.â€™â€™

Mr Arora pointed out that the Centreâ€™s auto fuel policy has its own schedule, making Euro III norms mandatory by 2005 and Euro IV by 2010. Truckers said it was more feasible to switch to Euro IV vehicles straightaway, instead of upgrading incrementally, and alleged that it was in the interest of the manufacturers to continue using old technology.

â€œThe transport operators and ultimately the consumers are the ones who are going to pay for the price of pollution control. Both the government and industry will be the ones to benefit,â€™â€™ said Mr Gehani.

2,DF govt ready for CBI probe into stamp scam,"NAGPUR: The process of handing over the inquiry into the fake stamp paper scam to the CBI has begun, deputy chief minister Chhagan Bhujbal said on Tuesday.

Mr Bhujbalâ€™s announcement, made in the course of a noisy debate in the assembly on the Telgi tehelka, is a clear indication that the ruling Democratic Front government has accepted the fait accompli of a CBI probe into the scam, which has marked an all-time low in Maharashtra politics.

Replying to a seven-hour debate, marred by mutual accusations and acrimony, Mr Bhujbal said chief minister Sushilkumar Shinde had received advice from the legal department about entrusting the CBI with the investigations into the Telgi scam.

He added that the process of filing an affidavit in the Mumbai high court, which is monitoring the SIT probe, had begun.

In a letter to the state government recently, Union home minister L.K. Advani had asked it to hand over the investigations to the CBI in view of the scamâ€™s national ramifications and the possible involvement of Pakistanâ€™s ISI.

In his 90-minute speech, leader of the opposition Narayan Rane of the Shiv Sena held Mr Bhujbal responsible for the â€œacts of commission and omissionâ€™â€™ of the Mumbai police force in handling the Telgi case.

Accusing the deputy CM of giving protection to Telgi,Mr Rane asked why the scam kingpinâ€™s wife and daughter, whose names figured in the FIR filed by the Pune police, had not yet been arrested.

Before Telgi was brought to Mumbai, he was assured of VIP treatment by the Mumbai police, which had permitted his stay in his well-appointed Colaba flat, Mr Rane alleged.

BJP leaders Gopinath Munde and Eknath Khadse joined Mr Rane in furnishing details about the Jaiswal investigation report and the circumstances which had led to Telgi using moneybags to purchase top officials of the Mumbai police.

Congress-NCP MLAs scarcely came to Mr Bhujbalâ€™s rescue when the opposition guns were booming in the house. Senior advocate P.R. Vakil said on Tuesday that the Bombay HC would have the final say on whether and when the case would be handed over to the CBI.

At the last hearing on November 27, the HC had said it would decide whether to hand over the case to the CBI at an appropriate stage and had posted the next hearing for January 16. According to Mr Vakil, the state government can seek to advance the hearing.

3,Waqf Board case: Oppn demands minister's resignation,"LUCKNOW: Minister for science and technology Chaudhary Basheer came under heavy fire from the BJP members as leader of the the opposition Lalji Tandon demanded his dismissal for allegedly grabbing the property of Waqf Board in Agra and show of terror tactics to silence the local media.

The issue led to the disruption of the proceeding in the assembly on Tuesday as BJP MLAs walked into the well of the house raising slogans against the minister and the disruption thrice led to the adjournment of the house.

Accusing the minister of large-scale wheeling dealing in the Waqf assets, Tandon alleged that Basheer had let out a reign of terror in Agra by misuse of official machinery. â€œIt was common for the minister to move in a motorcade of 15 vehicles all flashing red lights and hooting sirens,â€� alleged Tandon, adding that his supporters are also known to indulge in firing in public.

Earlier Ram Babu Harit (BJP) had drawn the attention of the house to blatant misuse of his status by the minister which he claimed has led to much harassment of the district officials. The minister, Harit said, peeved at the exposes carried out by the two prominent dailies had instigated his supporters to burn the effigies of their editors and beat up the hawkers. Bahsir, he also alleged, had threatened the mediamen with dire consequences if they dared oppose him.

The minister for parliamentary affairs Mohammad Azam Khan, promised that the allegations needed to be probed. â€œMoving around in beaconed cars however, he said, was no offence and Waqf property could also be disposed off conditionally.â€� Taking a pot shot at the BJP, Khan also said he would also like to probe their interest in the Waqf asset.

BJP MLAs also demanded debate over vital policies announced by the chief minister on Monday. Expressing displeasure with the summary disposal of important policy matters, Laxmi Kant Bajpai (BJP) demanded two hours long debate on proposed disinvestment of the sugar mills.

Slamming the government for selling out the state interest to industrial houses, Ghanshaym Shukla (BJP) said that the industrial policy or the new urbanisation scheme also needed a discussion on the floor of the house. The chair conceded an hours discussion over the issue on Wednesday in the presence of the chief minister.

4,Bar Council seeks ban on foreign lawyers,"BANGALORE: The Karnataka State Bar Council on Tuesday submitted a memorandum to governor T.N. Chaturvedi and Karnataka High Court Chief Justice N.K. Jain seeking a ban on entry of foreign lawyers and opposing permanent Lok Adalats creating parallel courts. The issue of non-representation of the legal fraternity in the National Judicial Commission too has been taken up in the memorandum.

The Bar has also expressed displeasure over some recommendations made in the Committee on Reforms of the Criminal Justice System stating that they are violative of fundamental rights.

The memorandum stated that permitting foreign lawyersâ€™ entry will affect the Indian legal profession. Availability of unlimited economic resource to foreign lawyers will result in their domination and exclusion of Indian lawyers and protecting national interest. The Bar has called for a ban on entry of foreign lawyers.

The Legal Services Authorities (Amendment) Act, 2002 provides of setting up of permanent Lok Adalats which is given powers to decide criminal matters also. These permanent Lok Adalats, according to the Bar, will be virtually creating parallel courts and public utility services will no longer be limited to government agencies.

Public services utilities have adequate adjudicatory mechanisms and can be dealt in civil courts. Creation of parallel agencies is not necessary, the memorandum stated. On the Advocates Act, 1961, Section 30 gives lawyers the right of representation in any court, tribunal or authority.

This section is not implemented and many enactments are being passed excluding the right of advocates to appear before tribunal or authorities, the Bar stated in the memorandum.

6,"Bandh failed, claims govt","PATNA: Home commissioner B K Haldar on Tuesday described the NDA and Lok Janshakti Party-sponsored Bihar bandh to protest against the removal of D P Ojha from the post of director general of police, as ""totally ineffective"".

There was no impact of bandh in government offices. The attendance in all government offices were normal, he said. Barring a few stray incidents of clashes, the bandh has failed to evoke any response, Haldar said. DGP W H Khan said that as many as 1,839 bandh supporters were arrested in the state, of which at least 500 were arrested in Patna alone.

About 136 bandh supporters were arrested in Begusarai and 400 in Sasaram, he added. Khan admitted that there were some disturbances in Gaya where a section of people exploded bombs and indulged in stone-throwing. Gaya range DIG has rushed to the spot.

The situation is totally under control, he said. Bandh supporters also disrupted rail traffic for a couple of hours at Darbhanga, Jamui and Samastipur, he said.

7,Book fair not hit by bandh,"PATNA: The 11th Patna Book Fair, which had become a centre of cultural activity for the past 12 days, came to an end on Tuesday. Despite a bandh call given by the NDA, people visited the book fair in large numbers.

Governor M Rama Jois attended the valedictory function organised on the book fair premises on Tuesday afternoon.

Speaking on the occasion, he said that some publishers are making money by selling pornographic books. Books occupy a place of worship in our tradition. Reading of bad books develops devilish tendencies in human beings, he said.

He said that publishers should make good books available to people at low prices, as propagation of knowledge is a sacred duty.

At the same function, Dr R K Chandra, from Switzerland, was given Patliputra Vidya Vachaspati Samman.

8,Mixed response to Bihar bandh,"PATNA: Disruption of train services at many places, including Patna, and stray incidents of violence marked the Opposition-sponsored â€˜Bihar bandhâ€™ on Tuesday. The movement of vehicles on national highways were also considerably affected during the 12-hour bandh.

The bandh was called to protest the removal of state police chief D P Ojha and to demand action on his recommendations regarding the prosecution of jailed Siwan MP and ruling party luminary, Mohammed Shahabuddin. The NDA alliance had, on Monday, urged the governor to direct the state government to make public the report given by Ojha regarding Shahabuddinâ€™s alleged ISI links.

It has also demanded dismissal of the Rabri Devi government. The bandh evoked a mixed response. Major businesses and a majority of private schools remained closed. But, smaller businesses, government offices and schools and several petrol pumps remained open.

In Patna, several private vehicles were seen plying on the main thoroughfare, Bailey Road. The police arrested around 650 people enforcing the bandh. Bandh supporters smashed windscreens and deflated tyres of some vehicles in Patna.

9,"Have a ball, break rules, just pay a fine","NEW DELHI: Shell out Rs 500 and party till you drop. The Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) on Tuesday dropped even the pretension of following the law by ordering that weddings and parties held in farmhouses should be allowed to continue after paying the necessary fine.

Standing committee chairman Ram Babu Sharma said, â€˜â€˜People are being harassed by the civic agencies and the police. We should allow them to celebrate as they have no other option.â€™â€™ Farmhouses and banquet halls are not allowed to be used for commercial activities, but during the wedding season and towards the year-end, they are heavily booked for parties.

The MCD directive may be music to the ears of the party-hoppers, for local residents it spells doom. Whether it is traffic snarls, â€˜â€˜mobile barsâ€™â€™ and the subsequent drunken brawls, residents of Vasant Vihar, Vasant Kunj and Mehrauli-Gurgaon road face a growing menace. â€˜â€˜Generators run through the night and so plays the wedding orchestra. There has been no respite since October because there are four or five weddings every night,â€™â€™ said Pawan Puri, who lives close to the Mehrauli-Gurgaon road.

Green Avenue resident Ashwini Khurana said, â€˜â€˜Generator fumes, loud music and fights are a daily feature. Some times it takes me an hour to cover half a km if I get caught in a wedding procession.â€™â€™ The mayhem continues despite the Delhi High Court order that bars wedding processions from certain roads, like MG Road, or Delhi chief secretaryâ€™s order that forbids government officials from attending parties hosted at farmhouses.

The restrictions seem to have done little to dampen the party spirit. And Banquet hall owners are having a field day. â€˜â€˜We have two lawns with a capacity of 500 and 1,000 people respectively and they have been booked two months in advance. We donâ€™t have an opening till January,â€™â€™ a banquet hall owner said.

11,NHRC chief concerned over non-implementation of rights laws,"NEW DELHI: National Human Rights Commission Chairman Justice (retd) A S Anand on Wednesday expressed serious concern over the non-implementation of laws aimed at preventing human rights violations in the country.

""Though the human rights movement in India has come a long way and many human rights centered legislations have also been enacted by legislatures, unfortunately most of these rights exist only in the statute books and are ignored in reality,"" he said inaugurating a function organised by NHRC to mark Human Rights Day.

Dwelling on the commission''s effort to ensure right to fair trail and protection of witnesses and victims of crime in a criminal trial, Anand said, ""riot victims of Gujarat have remained a concern for the commission.""

Underlining NHRC''s commitment to fight terrorist atrocities, the former Supreme Court chief justice said the goal of these terrorists was to destroy the very fabric of democracy and it would be wrong for any democratic state to consider international terrorism to be someone else''s problem.

""The oft-repeated cry ''one man''s terrorist is another man''s freedom fighter'' is but one manifestation of the widespread confusion about the morality of terroristic forms of violence,"" Anand said in an apparent reference to a recent US court ruling in favour of a Sikh separatist.
