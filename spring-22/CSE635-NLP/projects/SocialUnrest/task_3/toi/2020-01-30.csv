0,"Eye on polls, BJP readies GenNext","NEW DELHI: Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani has acknowledged that Wednesdayâ€™s Cabinet reshuffle is aimed at enhancing the partyâ€™s image before the coming slew of elections. Like Arjun, the BJP leadership is seeing only the eye of the fish as it takes aim at the 2004 general elections.

The departure of Vasundhara Raje, Uma Bharti and information technology minister Pramod Mahajan is an indicator of just how much attention is being paid to the organisational revamp in the run-up to the elections to 9 state assemblies and the general election in the coming 18 months.

Considering the few new faces, it''s clear that the reshuffle is more about showing that the BJP is an ''active'' party rather than providing a better fix on good governance.

Mahajan''s exit from the government was the surprise of this reshuffle. In the July 2002 reshuffle, Mahajan played a major role in the reshuffle and related revamp of the party''s central machinery. He will now become a general secretary of the party, de facto number two to Venkaiah Naidu. Mahajan earned accolades as an industry-friendly minister, but at the highest level of the party leadership, he was seen as being ""too friendly"".

So, when the proposal was mooted to shift him to some other ministry in the reshuffle, he chose instead to offer his resignation and work for the party organisation. Now, observers say that Mahajan is likely to use his formidable organisational skills to turn the coming slew of state assembly and general elections into an opportunity to emerge as the front-runner in the post-Advani party leadership.

Vajpayee and Advani''s decision to accept Mahajan''s shift put pressure on Arun Jaitley to re-enter the council of ministers, which he has done reluctantly. His stint as a general secretary has brought him into the frontline of the GenNext party leaders along with Mahajan, Modi and Venkaiah Naidu. Jaitley wanted to continue in that role, till at least the next general elections. However, he has been rewarded by an expanded portfolio which covers the important ministries of commerce and industries in addition to law and justice.

Having managed to snatch the political momentum from the Congress, the BJP is determined not to let it go through the coming state assembly elections in Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and several North-eastern states.

In fact, the BJP-led coalition has already started to avoid taking hard administrative decisions. This has manifested itself in the opposition to the Kelkar panel''s recommendations as well as the allowing the Delhi state party leadership to dismantle the construction and zoning laws in the city.

1,Haryana ministers to sit on fast,"CHANDIGARH: Haryana chief minister Om Prakash Chautala, accompanied by his ministerial colleagues, party MLAs and MPs, would sit on fast at Rajghat in New Delhi on Thursday in protest against the insult caused to Mahatma Gandhi by â€˜Maximâ€™ magazine published from the US, and MTV USA.

A memorandum will also be submitted to President APJ Abdul Kalam in this regard.

2,"PHRO alleges minister, MP 'shielding the guilty'","CHANDIGARH: In the gruesome case in which two orphan children were brutally beaten up in Jalandhar, so much so that one of them died, the Punjab Human Rights Organisation (PHRO) alleged here, on Tuesday, that a local minister and a MP from the ruling party were trying to ""shield the guilty"".

PHRO now plans to seek compensation for the family. The grandmother and uncle of the two unfortunate brothers were brought here by the PHRO to air their concerns that the ""investigations into the case are not derailed"".

Brought to city by the PHRO, the family presented a picture of meekness and helplessness. Talking to mediapersons here, Shashi Sharma, PHRO activist, narrated the unfortunate story. Sharma also alleged that the police could conduct a probe in favour of their ""guilty brethren"".

3,"Former SAD minister, Sohal in Vigilance net","CHANDIGARH: Continuing the drive against corruption, the Punjab Vigilance Bureau on Wednesday arrested a former SAD minister Sohan Singh Thandal, former chairman of the Punjab State Electricity Board (PSEB) GS Sohal, chief executive officer (CEO), Punjab Digital Industrial System Ltd (PDISL), Mohali, Manmohan Singh, superintendent engineer (irrigation) SK Bansal and senior Xen AK Khanna in the last 24 hours.

Disclosing this here, chief director-cum-ADGP, Vigilance Bureau (VB), AP Pandey, said that a case was registered against former SAD minister of state for food and supplies Sohan Singh Thandal for amassing assets disproportionate to his known sources of income.

He purchased landed properties of various dimensions measuring about 40 kanals at a cost of over Rs 24 lakh. He also built a kothi worth Rs 25 lakh and deposited huge amounts in the banks running into lakhs of rupees. He was arrested on Wednesday.

The VB also arrested former PSEB chairman GS Sohal in connection with bungling committed by the board in the purchases of electronic energy meters and causing loss to the tune of Rs 45 lakh to the state exchequer.

He said that in this deal 50,000 electronic meters were purchased at the rate of Rs 1,028 per meter while the board had option for purchasing these meters from another supplier at the rate of Rs 940 per meter. In this manner, the meters were purchased at the rate of Rs 88 per meter.

This deal was finalised to favour a particular group of Delhi-based manufacturer known to be close to the chairman. Pandey said the PSEB also purchased and accepted defective meters to give financial advantage to the suppliers at very nominal penalty of half per cent.

Pandey said Sr XEN AK Khanna, who was the purchase officer for this deal, was arrested on January 25. In another case, Col (retd) Manmohan, CEO of PDISL, Mohali (a subsidiary of Punjab Communication Ltd), was also arrested for allegedly defrauding the PDISL to the tune of Rs 40 to Rs 45 lakh for personal as well as benami gains. Manmohan was benami owner of the firm M/s Marcom Tele Systems.

Pandey said that as CEO, he allotted works to this firm at higher rates and pocketed the proceeds worth Rs 16 lakh. He also misused the official facilities like mobile phone, house rent, etc, for substantial personal gains.

The VB arrested superintendent engineer (irrigation) SK Bansal, posted at Patiala, for demanding Rs 5,000 for deciding the arbitration case of the complainant. He was caught red-handed by a team of vigilance officers.

4,"BJP gets into election mode, reshuffles Cabinet","NEW DELHI: The two Aruns â€” Shourie and Jaitley â€” emerged as the key gainers from Wednesdayâ€™s Cabinet reshuffle, even as the high profile Pramod Mahajan was shifted sideways to take up BJP organisational work.

Effected with an eye on the general elections next year, the overhaul saw several spectacular exits, six brand new faces to fill nine vacancies and a considerable amount of lateral movement between ministries.

This was a purely BJP affair and Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee said another reshuffle for NDA constituents would be undertaken ""very shortly"".

In a significant move, the PM shed the crucial Personnel department to Home Minister and Deputy PM L K Advani. It is after three decades that this department â€” which controls the CBI and all Central postings and transfers â€” has moved out of the PMâ€™s charge.

Jaitley got back his old portfolio of law and justice but has also been assigned the senior portfolio of commerce and industry â€” a ministry headed until now by ailing DMK stalwart Murasoli Maran, who remains a minister without portfolio.

Jana Krishnamurthy, who could not complete his term as BJP president, has been forced to cut short his ministerial stint as well. Vajpayee said he failed to persuade Jana to accept a job other than law.

Thakur, who was sacked as health minister in July last year, has now been brought back but given charge of small scale industries and North-East affairs, two relatively minor portfolios.

Inducted as minister of state with independent charge is BJP veteran from Uttaranchal, Sanghpriya Gautam (agro and rural industries). The five new ministers of state are: Dilip Singh Ju Deo, the firebrand Hindutva leader from Chattisgarh actively involved in conversion of tribals (environment and forests); Dilip Gandhi â€” a protege of Union oil minister Ram Naik â€”(shipping); Bhavna Chikhalia â€” a protege of Gujarat BJP stalwart Keshubhai Patel â€” (parliamentary affairs, tourism and culture); Jaskaur Meena from Rajasthan (HRD) and Chhatrapal Singh, a Lodh leader from UP (chemicals and fertilisers).

Though lobbying continued well into Wednesday evening, Shourie confounded those in

the BJP and the government who wanted him divested of disinvestment by not just

retaining his portfolio but gaining another economic ministry: communications and IT.

The key I&B ministry saw a change with Ravi Shankar Prasad replacing Sushma Swaraj who has been moved to health. Parliamentary affairs, part of Mahajanâ€™s erstwhile empire, has also been given to her. Shatrughan Sinha, whose underperformance in the health ministry came in for criticism, has shifted to shipping.

Vinod Khanna has been moved from tourism to external affairs. Jharkhand tribal leader Karia Munda gets charge of coal, replacing Uma Bharti.

The four ministers of state who resigned were Vasundhra Raje, Raman Singh, Nikhil

Kumar Choudhary and Rita Verma.

5,Haldia moderately safe for investment: ICRA,"HALDIA: Haldia has been declared to be a â€œmoderately safe placeâ€� for investment. The certificate has been given after a value assessment conducted by the Investment Credit Rating Agency ICRA of the Haldia Development Authorityâ€™s property and financial performance in the last 23 years.

â€œThis rating has been conducted to find out the factual progress after implementing various plans and development schemes,â€� chief executive officer, HDA, A. Subbaiah told TNN.

HDA has been found to possess property worth Rs. 115.22 crore, including land, building, estates. The authority has constructed water supply projects and roads have been assessed at Rs. 416.94 crores. Officials said that no other development authority in West Bengal is reported to be holding a larger value on property and fetching safe returns after investment on it.

The Rs. 115.22 crores investment on land acquisition, building, infrastructural roads and water supply fetches a safe return of above Rs. 15 crores annually, which comes to around 12 per cent of the investment. This ensures a money bank for undertaking infrastructural projects required for industrialisation here, he said.

The domestic and industrial water supply, along with rents and long term lease of lands, buildings and estates have put HDA to a self sufficient financial position, enabling it stand as a backdrop for industrialisation here. The combined story of industrial census made earlier and HDAâ€™s financial position will help in drawing more investment, Subbiah said. Such asset performance will also help HDA to procure more state and central grants, he added.

None of the assets go unutilised while HDA still have plans for property expansion by acquiring a large part of Nandigram and the HFC residential zone, he said. The nodal body will issue public bonds worth Rs. 20 crore. A three member committee has been formed to execute the bond plan and take up further planning and urban development.

6,Union minister frowns at Metro service,"KOLKATA: Metro Railway officials were on their toes all of Wednesday when Union minister of state for railways A K Murthy decided to inspect the underground service.

Senior officials could do little about angry commuters rushing up with their litany of complaints.

â€œWe often miss trains with only one ticket window open with long queues outside. When we try to reason with officials, they rudely brush us away,â€� an agitated youth told the minister just after the train left Maidan station. He was joined by others with similar complaints and the Metro general manager had a tough time warding off agitated commuters.

Before boarding the train from Park Street for Tollygunge, Murthy inspected the platform and was scathing in his criticism. â€œThrow away the kiosks if they do not work,â€� he told the station manager at Park Street, pointing to a dysfunctional touch-screen information kiosk on the platform. The ministerâ€™s next stop was near the water dispenser at one end of the platform. â€œDo you expect people to carry tumblers when they come for a Metro ride. How else can they drink water if you do not provide disposable cups,â€� he questioned. At Kalighat station, the minister spotted the clogged drains between the tracks and ticked off the nearest official available. â€œArenâ€™t you supposed to keep the drains clean,â€� he asked the official next to him. â€œWe do clean them once a week,â€� the official stammered in reply.

7,Development schemes’ progress reviewed,"HAJIPUR: Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) national president and Hajipur MP Ram Vilas Paswan and local MLAs Ram Kishore Singh and Nityanand Rai reviewed the progress of different Central government-sponsored development schemes with officials and members of the district board at the first meeting of the vigilance committee here on Wednesday.

The Hajipur MP has been nominated president and Vaishali MP Raghuvansh Prasad Singh of the RJD vice president of the vigilance committee by the government of India. The committee has been formed to monitor the execution of the development schemes and their results in the district.

At a press conference later, Paswan listed the objectives of the committee. He said that the committee was empowered to summon any official to show cause for slow pace of implementation of schemes or embezzlement of funds.

â€œThe committee will ensure proper implementation of the Centre-sponsored schemes and utilisation of funds in the district,â€� Paswan said, adding that the second meeting of the committee would be held within two months.

The next meeting will discuss â€œaction-taken reportsâ€� of the district administration.

Asked whether he was satisfied with the performance of the district administration insofar as achieving the targets of Centre-sponsored schemes is concerned, Paswan said it has been â€œneither good nor badâ€�.

Irked at the slow pace of construction of houses for the people below poverty line under the Indira Awas Yojna (IAY), Paswan said the Centreâ€™s target to provide houses to all the homeless by 2020 would never be achieved if the implementation of the scheme remains so slow.

On an average 2,000 houses are built in Vaishali district under the IAY for the BPL families in a year and it will require at least 170 years to achieve the target in the district, Paswan remarked.

Appreciating district magistrate Rashid Ahmad Khan for quick actions on reports of irregularities, Paswan asked the district administration to ensure â€œtransparencyâ€� in execution of the schemes.

In response to a query on the slow pace of IAY implementation in Raghopur, assembly constituency of Rabri Devi, Paswan said only 800 houses for BPL families were built against a target of 2,000 in the last three years.

8,Lucknow University to amend rules for selection,"LUCKNOW: Lucknow University authorities have agreed in principle to amend the rules for the selection of teachers and consider PhD holders along with the National Eligibility Test qualifiers for the post of lecturer.

The good news is that the application of aspirants, who have submitted their thesis by December 31, would also be considered for the posts. A proposal in this regard would be put before the Academic Council meeting scheduled on February 10, which is also being held after a gap of over two years.

The final approval, however, will be given by the Executive Council later in February. Thereafter, a corrigendum will be issued ratifying the earlier advertisement issued asking applications for around 142 posts of teachers in various departments of the LU.

The agreement was reached between the representatives of the Lucknow University Teacherâ€™s Association (LUTA) and the LU vice-chancellor held recently. LUTA president, Prof RS Yadav told the Times News Network that LU authorities have also agreed to separate the process of selection of teachers with that of the promotion.

Earlier, due to economy point of view, LU had decided to hold the committees for selection as well as promotions at the same time. The selection process for the said 142 posts was due in mid-January, the advertisement for which were issued last year in July.

However, the eligibility criterion only allowed NET qualifiers for the job. The candidates with only a PhD degree and those aspirants were not considered, despite the fact that there was a UGC order in favour of the PhD holders.

The process was later deferred following a stay order of the High Court.

9,"Differences between BSP, BJP over byelections","LUCKNOW: After Pota, the ruling coalition partners â€” the BSP and the BJP â€” now seem to be heading for a showdown in the by-elections slated to be held for the two assembly constituencies â€” Haidergarh and Gauriganj on February 26.

In the absence of any consensus so far, both the parties are keen to put up their candidates. While the BJP has staked claim on both seats, the BSP has threatened to put up a candidate in Gauriganj.

Both the coalition partners appears to be singing different tunes on seat-sharing. If the BJP state election committee has announced to contest on both assembly seats, the BSP is not lagging behind declaring name of Jang Bahadur Singh for the Gauriganj seat.

Singh, who had lost by mere 400 votes in 2002 assembly polls, has already started campaigning in the constituency after being given a go-ahead by the parliamentary affairs minister Ram Achal Rajbhar.

The Congress has also announced names for both the seats naming Imran Kidwai for Haidergarh and Fateh Mohammed for Gauriganj. The Haidergarh assembly seat had fallen vacant following resignation of the former chief minister Rajnath Singh after he was elected to the Rajya Sabha while by-polls are due in Gauriganj following death of Congress MLA Noor Mohammed.

By-polls are scheduled to be held on both seats on February 26. The BJP has faxed a panel of names on Wednesday to the party Central Election Committee recommending Sunder Lal Dixit for Haidergarh and Tej Bhan Singh for Gauriganj.

The Central Election Committee would finally decide candidates in consultation with the general secretary in-charge Rajnath Singh. On the other hand, the BSP vice-president and chief minister Mayawati has conveyed to BJP central leadership to contest Gauriganj, falling under Congress bastion Amethi, the parliamentary constituency of AICC president Sonia Gandhi.

The reasons for Mayawati pressing for the seat is well known. She wants to settle scores with the Gandhi clan for taking up the cause of Ram Bhajan, a Dalit from Punnupur. But it may not be an easy task to wrest the seat from Congress without support from the BJP as BSP candidate was third in last election and her decision to create Amethi as separate district did not go well among local residents.

Similarly, Rajnathâ€™s prestige too is at stake in Haidergarh. If he has his way Dixit may not get the ticket. Internal bickerings and local politics are threatening to upset the partyâ€™s poll calculations. It was due to this fear, the state unit has played it safe leaving the seat for Rajnath to manage. Clearly, both the ruling coalition partners are in a â€˜you scratch my back and I scratch yoursâ€™ situation, needing support from each other to ensure win.

If consensus eludes on seat-sharing and both partners chose to put up their own candidates, it may not only help opposition but give all wrong signals to mark the beginning of an end for the BJP-BSP alliance and the coalition government in the state.

11,CIMAP aim: database for farmers,"LUCKNOW: In a bid to move from bio-informatics to agro-informatics, an attempt is being made by CIMAP to develop information database for the benefit of farmers all over the country. This was announced by the director of CIMAP SPS Khanuja, at the day-long â€œHarit Kisan Melaâ€� on Wednesday.

According to Khanuja, It is imperative for an information bank where farmers can log on through their â€œcim-putersâ€� and get advise on how to improve yield and remove their difficulties while farming.

The information for the database is being collected from the participants in the mela through various forms they will be filling putting down their ideas, experiments, success or failures encountered during cultivation based on experience as farmers. Also announced on the occasion were two new schemes, â€œTarangâ€� and â€œCIM-Setu.â€�

The former being a novel education programme to begin in schools and colleges to make children aware of the â€˜green pathâ€™ for a better and healthy and life. â€œThrough this programme we will adopt schools and disseminate information regarding preserving environment and relevance of medicinal plants in a personâ€™s life. CIMAP will act as the nodal point developing knowledge units called â€œgyanicasâ€� for creating â€˜green knowledgeâ€™ frequency.

A similar programme has already been initiated at Maharishi Vidya Mandir,â€� Khanuja said. The latter, however, will concentrate on developing a link between CIMAP, farmers and the industry.

The objective of CIM-setu is to mainly build a bridge of knowledge to empower and educate farmers who want to turn into entrepreneurs. The impetus will also be on finding out how the technology transferred to framers by CIMAP has worked so far and what more is required by them.

Planting material of four new varieties was provided to farmers which included â€˜Kushalâ€™ a high yielding variety of menthol mint, â€˜CIM-Pawanâ€™ a early maturing variety of geranium with a high content of rodeniol, â€˜Nimaâ€™ a new improved variety of lemon grass which is widely used in perfumery, confectionaries, soaps and toiletries and pharmaceutical industry being the precursor of vitamin A, and â€˜Mayuriâ€™ a variety of Isabgol which can alert farmers when it is ready for harvest by changing its colour to peacock blue.

12,C P Thakur's inclusion in Cabinet relieves state BJP,"PATNA: The BJP camp in Bihar appears to have heaved a sigh of relief with the reinduction of C P Thakur into the Union cabinet even though his previous portfolio â€” health â€” eludes him.

â€œBihar is a politically significant state for any government at the Centre. Thakur has established himself as a senior leader of the state. We are happy with his reinduction,â€� observed state BJP vice-president Kiran Ghai. However, she denied that Thakurâ€™s reinduction has anything to do with the appeasement of any particular caste.

BJP leaders concede in private that Thakurâ€™s reinduction would go a long way to deflect the anger of Bhumihars and that it is once again a reflection of the compulsion of political parties to go along caste lines. Thakurâ€™s ouster from the Union cabinet in July last had caused outrage among Bhumihars and led to a series of protest by the youths of this caste under the banner of Brahmarshi Samaj. â€œHis removal led to the creation of seven outfits in the name of Brahmarshi Samaj,â€� stressed a Thakur supporter proudly. What hurt Thakurâ€™s supporters more was the fact that the eminent doctor had been replaced by a film star, Shatrughan Sinha, as the Union health minister.

The induction of a low-profile Bhumihar MP, Nikhil Kumar Choudhary, into the Union ministry in July last did not help the state BJP much as various caste outfits declared that Choudhary was no replacement for Thakur. Senior BJP leaders like Sushil Kumar Modi were heckled by Bhumihar youths during their tours. Even non-BJP leaders belonging to Bhumihar caste like RJD minister Akhilesh Singh, Samata Party MP Arun Kumar and Congress leaders Mahachandra Singh and Ram Jatan Sinha played up the removal of Thakur as an insult to the caste.

To the great distress of the BJP, RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav used the brewing discontent to lure the Bhumihars who have firmly opposed his regime for the last 13 years. In Barh, he got a local leader organise a meeting calling for an alliance between Yadavs and Bhumihars. The sole Bhumihar minister belonging to the RJD, Akhilesh Singh, organised a show at the S K Memorial Hall here for caste members. Laloo praised the caste as a race of fighters. â€œI do not know who triggered enmity between me and this caste,â€� he remarked while calling for a closer relationship between Bhumihars and Yadavs. Meanwhile, the RJD proposes to take out a â€œrath yatraâ€� throughout the state under the banner of Brahmarshi Samaj in a bid to appease Bhumihars.

13,Advocates protest police mistreatment,"BANGALORE: Advocates led by their association president K.N. Subba Reddy staged a protest in front of Police Commissioner M.D. Singh''s chamber on Wednesday after the commissioner asked them to come in a small group to meet him.

Advocates insisted that all of them be allowed to meet Singh to complain against the Rajajinagar police inspector, who allegedly did not offer a seat to two women advocates and behaved rudely during their visit to the police station on Monday.

According to a press note from the police commissioner''s office, over 40 advocates wanted to meet him in his chamber. The commissioner came out and tried to pacify the lawyers. They walked out after refusing to talk to Singh. Reddy said only eight women advocates and officer bearers had come.

Police said Rowdy Mani Bharathiâ€™s brother Armugam was offering cable TV connection for Rs 90 per month, causing a rift with competitors. ""On Tuesday, we had called the parties for discussions. Two advocates Nagamani and Rathna Bai accompanied Armugam.

As there was no space, we couldnâ€™t offer seat,"" Rajajinagar Police Inspector Shamanna said.

15,Kidney recipients also included NRIs,"CHANDIGARH: The investigation into the clandestine sale of kidneys in Punjab took a new turn when it came to the notice of officials that the kidney recipients included atleast 50 NRIs who came from as far off as Canada and European countries.

The special investigation team (SIT) is investigating about two charted flights which supposedly came to Amritsar last year carrying 20-25 NRIs who took advantage of the flourishing kidney trade and got transplants done on them.

The special investigation team (SIT) is browsing through the records seized from the Kakkar hospital to ascertain information.

""The task is slightly arduous as the NRI recipients might have been operated upon on fake names given the kind of situation that obtained at that time,"" said an officer.

As the Amritsar-based authorisation committee is not allowed to clear cases of kidney transplants of people living outside Amritsar, Jalandhar and Gurdaspur districts, the SIT has not ruled out the possibility of the NRIs being wrongly shown as Amritsar residents, the practice which the middlemen carried out for kidney recipients coming from outside the state.

According to the preliminary information, one each flight came from Canada and France. IG police (Jalandhar range) S K Sharma, who is supervising the investigation confirmed that the SIT was working on the information, but refused to comment further.

17,CAG points out vulnerable areas of disinvestment,"NEW DELHI: The Comptroller and Auditor General said on Thursday inventory assets of public sector undertakings had become a ""vulnerable"" area for disinvestment as these were not complete and not verified systematically.

""Inventory of assets is not complete and many times it is not verified systematically. The distinction between core and peripheral assets in relation to the going concern assumption is not clear. This is a particularly vulnerable area for PSUs slated for disinvestment,"" CAG V N Kaul said here.

This comes at a time when the Government is aggressively pursuing big-ticket disinvestment of PSUs like BPCL, HPCL, Shipping Corporation of India and Hindustan Copper.

Addressing a seminar, organised by Institute of Chartered Accoutants of India, he said amounts recoverable from the government and other PSUs were shown as ""good"" debts even after 10-15 years and sometimes up to 30 years.

Calling for a restructuring of Board of Directors of PSUs with an eye on the composition of audit committtes, Kaul said the committees were ""ineffective"" in assessing the risks and in overseeing internal audit arrangement, exercising oversight on financial reporting and evaluating audit process.

""The absence of qualified independent directors in PSUs affects the formation of a truly effective audit committees,"" he said, adding that existing audit committees in most PSUs failed to provide meaningful guidance to internal auditors.

He said the arrangements for internal audit in most PSUs needed ""improvement"" as it formed part of finance division in many of them (PSUs) and in many cases the internal audit had lost sight of its main objective of ensuring internal controls to mitigate the enterprise-wide risks.

18,I did not insist on law ministry: Jana,"NEW DELHI: Former Law Minister K Jana Krishnamurthy on Thursday said he had not insisted on retaining law ministry before resigning on Wednesday.

He said he would not disclose the reasons for not accepting the Prime Minister''s offer of some other portfolio.

""It is not correct to say that I wanted only law ministry. I never demanded it nor did the Prime Minister ask me whether I insist on law. The Prime Minister was gracious enough to offer me one or two other ministries,"" he said.

""I declined it but not on grounds that I wanted to continue in law. I did not accept the Prime Minister''s offer for reasons best known to him and me and the reasons are the same which made me to decline Prime Minister''s invitation to join the Cabinet last June end,"" he said a day after the Cabinet reshuffle, which saw him exit from the government.

Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had told reporters in Rashtrapati Bhavan on Wednesday that Krishnamurthy had resigned as he wanted to retain law ministry and was not agreeable to any other portfolio.

""I am not in anyway hurt and I continue to enjoy the trust and confidence of the Prime Minister,"" he said.

To a question whether he would continue as member of Parliament, he said, ""I will continue as member of Parliament unless the party feels otherwise. Whatever the party expects of me, I will do it.""

Asked about his role in the party, he said ""I will do whatever is expected of a primary member of a party.""

To a question that he had wanted to step down on health grounds, Krishnamurthy said ""much was made of my health. I had some health problem as every other human being but that did not come in the way of my ministerial work. I have no regrets and I am happy to have enjoyed confidence and affection of one and all.""

Asked whether he proposed to write a book on his long public life having begun his political career from an early age as a member of the RSS, the former BJP president said, ""I intend writing down my experience in public life. I have definite views on Hindutva, Ayodhya and long interaction with the Sangh Parivar organisations.""

""I will put down in paper the development of politics in general and I have certain definite views which I will be putting down but not with the idea of publishing,"" he added.

After what he described as a ""long innings in party and short one in Cabinet, now I can spend time with the family as in the last 10 years I have had very little time.""

19,Sonia flays NDA govt for rise in poverty,"NEW DELHI: Launching a frontal attack on the BJP-led NDA government, Congress President Sonia Gandhi on Thursday said that poverty, unemployment and corruption had mounted during the last four years and the gap between rich and poor had widened.

Describing the disinvestment and privatisation policies of the government as ""anti-people and ""anti-poor"", she accused the party of selling off profit making PSUs at throwaway prices as a result of which some people were getting richer and the poor were suffering.

Without naming any political party or organisation, the Congress president said that those behind the Gujarat violence and those involved in the killing of the Father of the Nation shared the same ideology.

She was speaking at a function organised at the AICC headquarters to pay homage to Mahatma Gandhi on his 55th death anniversary.

She said that the communal forces today threatened the secular and democratic fabric of the country and were bent upon destroying the invaluable principles of non-violence and truth which Gandhiji stood for.

She asked her partymen to prepare themselves for a long struggle to fight communalism and said that they had to work in a manner that the Congress emerged as a party of the poor and downtrodden.

20,Sena follows democratic principles: Thackeray,"MAHABLESHWAR: Shiv Sena supremo Bal Thackeray on Thursday asserted that his party continued to follow democratic principles and said that the elevation of his son Uddhav to the post of executive president was in keeping with this tradition.

Addressing reporters at the two-day party conclave at Mahableshwar, a nearby hill station, he justified Uddhav''s new post by claiming it was based on a common consensus within the party.

""I do not want to force either Raj or Uddhav on the party. I agreed to Uddhav''s election only after being assured that it was based on popular choice by the party workers,"" he said even as he rebutted criticism levied against Sena for having a dictatorial set up.

The Sena supremo also claimed that the constant efforts by a certain section to create a rift between Uddhav and Raj Thackeray had failed.

Lashing out at Congress President Sonia Gandhi, Thackeray said that the Congress lacked a leader of calibre for the top post of the party.

Ridiculing Sonia''s projection as the ''desh ki bahu'', he said that all women in the country could also put forward similar statements and such claims were nothing more than a mere facade.

Apparently dissatisfied by Election Commission''s decision making it mandatory for political parties to hold intra-party polls, the Sena leader said that each party should have the right to decide its own set up.

24,Cong calls rally to dilute Opposition agenda,"PATHANKOT: The Gurdaspur District Congress Committee, upbeat after sweeping the Block Samiti elections, has decided to counter the Shiromani Akali Dal â€œpropagandaâ€� regarding the Panchkula episode involving principal secretary Mukul Joshi, by holding a rally at Nehru Park in Gurdaspur, on January 31.

The unit plans to highlight the achievements of the Amarinder government and â€œgalvaniseâ€� the party cadres for the Municipal poll. This is in the wake of the Opposition â€” Shiromani Akali Dal-BJP â€” deciding to use the Panchkula affair as an issue in the Municipal poll, and the SAD giving a Punjab bandh call over it on February 10.

According to Gurdaspur DCC leaders, a directive has been issued to all prospective candidates for the MC poll to ensure a â€œshow of strengthâ€� to make the rally, to be addressed by Cabinet ministers Chaudhary Jagjit Singh and Khushal Behal, a grand success. According to party sources, Chaudhary will inaugurate the Rs 40 lakh sewerage plan for Gurdaspur before addressing the rally.

Other senior party leaders besides Behal, who will speak on the occasion include former minister Sukhbans Kaur Bhinder and DCC vice-president Raman Behal.

While the Opposition is aiming to start a â€œmovementâ€� for the dismissal of Amarinder government, the Congress leaders see â€œno dangerâ€� to the government. â€œThe government is stable as a rock and will complete its term,â€� Pathankot MLA Ashok Sharma told TNN on Wednesday.

Sharma,who left for Port Blair on Wednesday, said it as evident from the Block Samiti poll results that the BJP-SAD alliance does not stand anywhere. We are expecting the same thumping victory in the MC poll.

27,State govt plans high-capacity buses by October,"NEW DELHI: The Delhi state government plans to introduce high-capacity buses, which will be assigned a dedicated bus lane, in the next eight months. An electric trolley bus system will also be put in place.

Addressing a press conference on Thursday, state transport minister Ajay Maken said, â€˜â€˜The committee, set up to study various modes of transport, has recommended that high-capacity and electric trolley buses are two feasible systems that can be used in the city.â€™â€™

The committee comprised the chief secretary, transport commissioner, IIT professor Dinesh Mohan, Union government joint secretary (training) O P Aggarwal and other traffic experts.

Maken said work on a 19-kilometre corridor for the high-capacity buses would begin in the next four months. â€˜â€˜It is not just about constructing a dedicated lane. We are involving road engineers to relocate roadside shops and also install traffic lights that would be connected to a global positioning system fixed in the bus,â€™â€™ he said.

Other traffic will be prevented from using these lanes. The GPS in the buses will be aligned with traffic signals such that they will never have to encounter a red signal. The corridor will run between Ambedkar Nagar and Kashmere Gate inter-state bus terminus. â€˜â€˜We chose this stretch for our pilot study because about 360,000 people use this corridor daily,â€™â€™ Maken said.

The government will purchase the high capacity buses in the next couple of months. â€˜â€˜These buses cost about 1.5 times CNG buses. But the benefits are many,â€™â€™ he said.

29,"Pairing govt, public schools","NEW DELHI: The Delhi state government plans to pair its government schools with the private schools to improve their standard and break the cultural divide between rich and poor students.

This decision was taken after a pilot project started in 2001 led to the improvement of board examination results of government school students.

The project called â€˜â€˜the twinning programmeâ€™â€™ was introduced in about 70 government schools that were paired with 66 private schools.

State Council of Education Research and Training director Janki Rajan told The Times of India: â€˜â€˜Our twinning programme has had very good results. There has been a perceptible improvement in the board examinations and the interaction between the two sets of schools has increased.â€™â€™

After the twinning programme, 46 government schools reported an improvement of about 6 per cent in the Class 10 results. About 31 schools improved by 10 per cent and 17 schools recorded an improvement of about 20 per cent.

She said: â€˜â€˜The level of improvement has been heartening and we plan to extend it to all schools. We are working out the logistics of the future programme.â€™â€™

Delhi has about 1,000 government and 800 private schools. â€˜â€˜Many of our schools run in shifts. So, one private school can easily twin with two shifts,â€™â€™ she said.

The government has already written to all private schools informing them about the programme and inviting them to join it. â€˜â€˜We have received a huge response from private schools. Though they do not have any incentive to be a part of it, they want to do it solely as a social responsibility,â€™â€™ she said.

Rajan said: â€˜â€˜The purpose behind this programme was to bridge the gap between government and private schools. We wanted to narrow the cultural divide between principals, teachers and students of the two sets of schools.â€™â€™

She said: â€˜â€˜We also thought this would bring about attitudinal changes between the two sets.â€™â€™

After pairing two schools, it was left to the two to decide how to share resources. â€˜â€˜The pace, intensity and focus of interaction varies from pair to pair. Some private schools have volunteered to organise computer training sessions for government school teachers and principals,â€™â€™ she said.

At the beginning there were teething problems. She said: â€˜â€˜The cultural divide was a problem in a few schools. In fact, most of the resistance seemed to be from the government schools as they feared that this programme would eventually lead to privatisation.â€™â€™
