0,Cong ministers hit back at SAD campaign,"CHANDIGARH: Upset over the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) offensive against the Amarinder Singh government through advertisement campaign in newspapers, highlighting alleged corruption, on Monday, five senior ministers have contested the SAD assertions.

Arguing that the anti-corruption drive of the Punjab government was not against any individual or political party, these ministers said that Amarinder Singh has even not hesitated to sack his own minister Harbans Lal following his indictment in a forest scam on Sunday.

Referring to Badalâ€™s unprovoked tirade against Congress president Sonia Gandhiâ€™s alleged anti-Sikh actions during the past two decades, the ministers said that it was only her timely intervention which enabled Badal win the SGPC poll last year.

In a joint statement issued here on Monday, Jagjit Singh, Lal Singh, Partap Singh Bajwa, Sardool Singh, Gurchet Singh Bhuller and Jasjit Singh Randhawa said the charge of disappearance of Rs 2 crore from the bank lockers of dismissed PPSC chairman Ravi Sidhu, was totally baseless and factually incorrect. In fact, the lockers were opened in the presence of the bank officials, vigilance officials and electronic media, they asserted.

Referring to another allegation regarding Rs 5,000 crore loan from the International Finance Consortium (IFC), the ministers clarified that the state had received the letter from the IFC with regard to the approval of the loan pending clearance from the Union Government. However, it is unfortunate that Badal for his narrow vested and political interests had been mounting pressure on the Centre to stall its approval.

Making a counter offensive, these ministers further asked Badal that he too had gone abroad thrice during his rule for unsubstantiated purposes. In fact, he should clarify whether he had gone there to seek loans for development or to deposit his ill-gotten money in foreign banks or to keep it with his relatives.

Referring to the allegation regarding the excise auctions, they said proper procedures were adopted to the satisfaction of all the bidders. In fact, the license fee had risen from Rs 1,100 crore during 2001-02 at the time of Badal regime to Rs 1,199 crore in 2002-03 and Rs 1,219 crore in 2003-04 during present government.

The ministers strongly condemned Parkash Singh Badalâ€™s â€œsinister conspiracy to mobilise innocent rural massesâ€� to launch a morcha against the Punjab governmentâ€™s anti-corruption drive. â€œBadalâ€™s morcha against corruption drive is unprecedented and amusing. It is amazing that Badal should expect people to accept his leadership,â€� they said.

2,Health minister says sorry for death of children,"HYDERABAD: Health minister Kodela Sivaprasada Rao on Monday apologised for the death of 65 children in six districts due to atypical measles encephalitis. â€œWe feel sorry for it. The deaths occurred in 24 to 36 hours,â€� he said.

He conceded that lack of adequate precautions by health officials in Karimnagar and Warangal led to the unprecedented number of deaths, all in the age group of 2-14 years.

â€œWe have sacked the careless officials responsible for the spread of the disease,â€� the minister added.

Kodela said the highest number of deaths were reported from Karimnagar (28) followed by Warangal (24), Nizamabad (6), Adilabad and Krishna (3 each) and Nellore, with one death. Detailing the precautions being taken to prevent the disease from spreading, the health minister was prompt in supporting his department, stating, â€œIt is not one departmentâ€™s effort. A collective effort by the panchayat raj, municipal health, water works, social welfare and medical & health wings could have definitely helped in containing the disease at the preliminary stage.â€�

Dispelling doubts on the severity and spread of the disease in Telangana, he said sufficient doses of measles and Japanese Encephalitis vaccines have been stocked in all the affected districts to meet any exigencies. â€œAll the districts are on an alert with rapid response teams in place. Nearly 10 lakh doses of preventive vaccines are at their disposal,â€� he said. Kodela said 124 cases were reported from 84 villages in 62 mandals of the six districts since June 1. But only two cases were reported between June 1 and 15. At least 35 villages were affected in Warangal, he added. Ruling out the occurrence of cholera cases in the city, he said all of them had symptoms of gastroenteritis. He appealed to the people to keep their surroundings clean and consume potable water.

The health minister said an entomological team from the state headquarters and the zonal malaria office visited the affected areas. Expert teams from Kakatiya Medical College and Osmania Medical College have been deputed to investigate the suspected outbreak of encephalitis. He said fogging, spraying and anti-larval operations were taken up in 69 affected villages and 84 paramedical teams have been deployed to conduct surveillance operations and treat affected people.

3,TRS bandh chokes NH-7,"HYDERABAD/MAHABUBNAGAR: The TRSsponsored Mahabubnagar district bandh was total in the town, while it was partial in other parts of the district. The Congress Forum for Telangana (CFT) extended its support to the bandh.

Traffic on the National Highway 7 came to a standstill following the rasta roko of the CFT. Both the parties have asked the government to immediately close the Rajolibanda Diversion Scheme (RDS) sluices.

Farmers of RDS ayacut, led by TRS and CFT leaders, blocked the NH 7 at Erraballi Crossroads on Monday for about six hours. Hundreds of vehicles stranded were stranded on the highway due to the blockade. Police resorted to a lathi charge for dispersing the agitators. Over 20 agitators, including Mahabubnagar District Congress Committee president Jagadiswara Reddy, received minor injuries. Police arrested 200 agitators and restored the traffic.

The TRS and CFT leaders announced that the blockade would continue for 36 hours or till they get an assurance from the government over the supply of water to the ayacut. The TRS and CFT leaders alleged that chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu was ignoring the problems of Alampur and Gadwal constituencies to protect the interests of Kurnool district. This resulted in Mahabubnagar being deprived of water from RDS, they alleged.

Addressing a press meet at Erraballi Crossroads, TRS leader and Alampur MLA R Ravindranath Reddy, former Congress MLA D K Bharathsimha Reddy criticised the TDP government for supporting Kurnool farmers and helping them get more water than their share from the river Tungabhdra. The CM decided not to protect the rights of RDS farmers since the TDP stood no chance in winning Alampur and Gadwal seats in the next elections, they alleged.

The TRS and CFT leaders demanded that the local TDP leaders quit the party and fight for the farmersâ€™ cause. CFT president G Chinna Reddy, PCC joint secretary Mallu Ravi, Kodangal MLA Gurnadha Reddy and several other leaders also spoke.

Elsewhere, police arrested over 100 TRS activists in Wanaparti, Kothakota and Kosigi. With the Kurnool police stopping all vehicles in Peapully, Dhone and Kurnool till the blockade was lifted, there were about 50 trucks stranded on the Kurnool side at Erraballi Crossroads, whereas on the Mahabubnagar side, there were over 1,000 vehicles. Police officials waited for about five-andhalf hours and requested the leaders to lift the blockade. Joint collector L Shasidhar, Gadwal revenue divisional officer Ramani also tried to pacify the agitators. Hyderabad range DIG C R Naidu, district collector K Madhusudhan Rao, SP R K Meena visited Erraballi Crossroads.

4,Examinees want 'free hand' in law exams,"DARBHANGA: Examinees of LLB (Part I, II & III) examination under LNMU are boycotting the examinations since July 3 in protest against the refusal of the centre superintendent of the local MLSM College Centre to grant them some ""concessions"" and ""relaxations"" during the examination period.

These examinees are students of Law College, Samastipur. The relaxation demanded by the would-be-lawyers consist of allowing them to smuggle the books and notes in the examiantion hall. Since Thursday, these examinees are coming at the examination centre daily and on being denied the ''relaxations'' leave the centre.

Sources at the examination centre informed that the logic put forward in favour of their demands, is rather strange. Examinees tell the invigilators at the college gate that ""since practicising lawyers are allowed books and journals inside the court room during arguments, hence, they should also be allowed books and notes in the examination hall.""

Another logic put by the examinees is that during the previous examinations, unfair means was allowed and they were under impression that this time too, they would be given the ''facility''.

""But the sudden change of stance is a big injustice done to them by the university authorities,"" they argue.

Sources further revealed that the students pleaded that university should have announced through a communique that there would be no unfair means in the examination, then they would have prepared for the exams accordingly.

When contacted, both the centre superintendent and the examination observer confirmed about the irrational demands of the examinees and that also the logic put by them. However, examination at the other centre, M R College, is going on peacefully.

5,"Woman, 3 children burnt alive, in-laws suspected","KOLKATA: A woman and her three young children were allegedly burnt alive on Sunday evening at their Tangra residence in east Kolkata.

Stunned neighbours removed the charred bodies of 35-year-old Anita Singh, her threeyear-old son Sonu, four-year-old daughter Rani and eight-year-old Rahul from the to the NRS Hospital where they succumbed to their burn injuries.

Anita in her dying declaration, said her mother-in-law Rukmini Devi had set all of them ablaze. She also accused her three brother-in-laws â€” Anil, Omprakash and Jayprakash Singh of instigating the murder.

Police later arrested Rukmini Devi from her Meher Ali Road residence.

The male members of the family, all co-owners of a plasticrecycling business, are absconding. Neighbours said Anitaâ€™s husband Parasuramâ€™s first wife too had â€œdisappearedâ€� one morning, years ago.

An eerie silence had gripped the Tangra residence of the Singhs when TNN visited the spot. The room where the incident took place had been meticulously cleaned, leaving no specimen for the forensic experts. The gas oven was found intact. The couple were married for 16 years.

However, the incident remained shrouded in mystery due to a conflicting statement given by the only surviving witness, Nitu, â€” the 12-year-old daughter of Anita.

The girl said the blaze was accidental. But neither the police, nor their neighbours are buying this version. Investigators said Nitu was already under the influence of Anitaâ€™s in-laws. â€œCircusmtantial evidence also hints at murder,â€� an officer said.

According to deputy commissioner (ESD) Anuj Sharma, on Sunday, the Tangra police received a call from the NRS Hospital about the four charred bodies. A probe revealed that Anita and her three children were inside a room. Her 60-year- mother-in-law had poured kerosene and then set her ablaze. The children in the room were also set on fire.

Nitu said she was cleaning dishes when she saw her mother in flames rushing out. â€œNeither my mother-in-law, nor my uncles were there in the house then,â€� Nitu, who studies in class V, said. Deputy commissioner (detective department) Soumen Mitra said, â€œAnitaâ€™s husband Parasuram was an alcoholic. His ever-increasing family was creating financial problems. This was the reason Anita cited in her dying declaration as the motive for the murder.â€� An unrepentant Parasuram, who was spotted near Tangra police station, said, â€œIt was an accident. The stove burst.â€�

6,Judge's son fires at in-laws,"KANPUR: Rahat, the 27-year-old son of Justice IM Quddusi, a high court judge, reportedly opened fire at his in-laws here on Monday morning, injuring his father-in-law Dr SA Khan in the left thigh.

According to information, the incident was an outcome of a protracted and painful matrimonial discord between Rahat and his 20-year-old wife Rubina, ever since they tied the nuptial knot on June 10, 2001.

Shocked family members and neighbours at M-5/9 KDA colony, Jajmau residence of the Khansâ€™, informed that Rahat drove down from Lucknow to their house in the wee hours of Monday following their refusal to accept the demand of the judge around mid-night over phone for a patch-up and send Rubina back to their Lawrence Terrace house in the state capital.

""He came around 5 am and started banging on the door,"" informed a family member who pointed out that Rahat was at that time in an inebriated state.

""He was unable to talk or concentrate and insisted that he would take Rubina back home,"" said Dr SA Khan.

Talking from the intensive care unit (ICU) bed at the Madhuraj Nursing Home near Motijheel, Khan, who was hit by a bullet in his left thigh, said that on his refusal to send the girl with him as he was still using dope and ""had not mended his ways"", Rahat pulled out a pistol and shot at Rubinaâ€™s brother. He, however, had a providential escape. Rahat then started dragging Rubina by her hair and tried to forcibly take her to the porch where his Toyota Qualis (UP 32 AJ 2499; reportedly given as part of dowry) was parked.

When the 52-year-old Khan physically resisted his moves, Rahat fired at him and fled the scene in panic on his red beacon-fitted car. Recalling the trauma of being subject to endless physical torture, Rubina, who had studied at St Josephâ€™s College here, said that Rahat was so harsh with her that he had even assaulted her when she was six monthâ€™s pregnant in November, last year.

Later, a named FIR was filed by the Khans against Rahat, Basiq, Atul Verma and a gunner. The police have registered a case under section 307 of the IPC and started investigations.

8,"BSNL, MTNL get new equipment procurement rules","NEW DELHI: The government has announced new equipment procurement norms for state-owned telecom companies BSNL and MTNL, saying, this move would streamline the tendering process and help the two firms to expand operations faster.

This year, BSNL and MTNL have plans to spend around Rs 15,000 crore on switches, towers, optic fibre cable, microwave backbone to give out about 6 million cellular, WLL-M (mobile wireless in local loop) and fixed phone connections.

Over the past few years, the tendering procedures have caused much controversy and led to delays in roll-out of projects of MTNL and BSNL. Often, companies that fail to win orders end up sending anonymous letters to the various government authorities and the media alleging irregularities in the processes, making senior officials answerable to investigating agencies and slowing down the expansion plans.

Besides, political pressures are mounted on the two companies that end up involving the ministry. A couple of years ago, BSNL''s cellular telephony roll out got delayed in part because the then communications minister Pramod Mahajan wanted foreign vendors to offer a better deal to the company in a contract that was worth about Rs 2,000 crore.

Outlining some of these difficulties faced by BSNL/ MTNL, communications minister Arun Shourie said on Tuesday that the new guidelines would be effective because equipment makers, led primarily by TEMA (Telecom equipment manufacturers Association), were involved in evolving the guidelines.

Shourie also said that the ministry would not be involved in the procurement process, unless some serious allegations were brought to the notice. He said however, that even that should not be necessary because industry players would together (not individually) settle these matters at the level of CMDs.

Shourie said steps have been taken -- in the 21-point procurement guidelines -- to ensure that companies do not default on their commitments after putting aggressively bid. Equipment makers bid low to win contracts and some firm trying to enter Indian market make commitments without the ability to execute orders.

Following are some of the new procurement norms:

Tender processing time cut to 180 days from 210 days; bid validity reduced to 150 days.

BSNL/MTNL to decide procurement methodology; will be able to place repeat order worth up to 50 per cent of contract value, within 12 months.

Bid security will be 2 per cent, maximum of Rs 2 crore.

Performance bank guarantee increased from Rs 1 crore to 5 per cent of the order value.

9,India slips in human development ranking,"NEW DELHI: India has slipped three notches, from 124 to 127, in its ranking on the UNDP''s human development index (HDI), which measures the achievements of countries on the basis of indicators like life expectancy, educational attainment and income levels.

India, however, is comforting itself, saying this slippage is only notional as two new countries, Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Palestinian Territories, have been added to the list of nations in the 2003 UNDP Human Development Report. Besides, Botswana has improved its position and moved above India as compared to last year. Although there has not been any improvement in India''s ranking, there has been a sustained increase in its development values, Planning Commission deputy chief K C Pant said.

India is also drawing solace from the fact that the report, released here on Tuesday, is replete with laudatory references to the country''s achievements. The report, a status report on how different countries are moving towards achieving the eight Millennium Development Goals adopted by them in 2000, compliments India for its impressive performance in reducing poverty and improving economic growth.

There is a special mention about how Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, having the worst social indicators, have transformed schooling for the poor through special policies. Similarly, Kerala and West Bengal have been praised for their effective decentralisation policies which, the report says, have improved the lives of people, reflected in significant increases in its literacy levels and health status.

The report says Kerala has also succeeded in providing food security to the poor while its health indicators compare with those of the US despite spending just $ 28 per person a year.

Among the report''s findings is that the first of the millennium goals - that of reducing by half the number of people living on less than a dollar a day - is likely to be reached due to sustained economic growth in two of the world''s most populous countries, India and China. While China''s economy moved 150 million people out of poverty during the past decade, India averaged a robust four per cent growth annually from 1990 to 2000.

Yet, India is home to the largest number of hungry people at 233 million while 40 million children, more than one-third of the world''s total, are not in primary school. This is despite the fact that nearly a third of direct education spending supports private institutions.

Despite the improved national figures, the report points to the vast regional disparities as the benefits are yet to reach some areas and groups while wealthy segments of the population continue to surge ahead. The report refers to the grave concerns in health, largely due to poor infrastructure, widespread undernutrition and high mortality rates among the poorest, rural and scheduled caste populations. Literacy rates among the STs were as low as seven per cent in Rajasthan and nine per cent in MP. Regional variations in economic growth show that per capita economic growth ranged from 0.2 per cent in Bihar to 7.8 per cent in Gujarat.

Overall, the progress of nations has not been encouraging, says the report, warning that if this pace continues, only the goal of reducing poverty and halving the proportion of people without access to safe drinking water stand a realistic chance of being met. And this is thanks mainly to the efforts of China and India.

10,Sex selection test: BMC to file case against clinic,"MUMBAI: The civic health department will file a case with the chief metropolitan magistrate against Malpani Infertility Clinic at Colaba on Wednesday for propagating banned sex determination techniques on its website.

BMC''s action follows Monday''s supreme court order, which asked the state to take action against the clinic within three weeks. The directive was passed when a petition on sex selection and female foeticide, filed by a city-based non-government organisation Cehat, was being heard. The petitioner''s counsel showed a copy of a printout downloaded from the clinic''s website, which included a page on â€˜How to select the sex of your baby''.

This violated the recently amended Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques (Prohibition of Sex Determination) Act, 1994, the petitioner said. The Act,which bans sex selection of test tube embryos to be implanted in the womb, provides for a penalty of three years'' imprisonment and a fine of Rs 10,000 for those involved in sex determination tests.

On Tuesday, the â€˜appropriate authority'' in the cityâ€”set up under the Act for checking sex selection tests, comprising civic health officials among othersâ€”conducted a search of Dr Malpani''s clinic, rated as one of India''s top five infertility clinics in a recent magazine survey.

Civic joint executive health officer Dr Jayant Telang said that the website has material ""which goes against the Act"". A case will be filed against the clinic on Wednesday, he added.

Dr Aniruddha Malpani told TNN that the BMC was objecting to the information available on the website.

This was put up before the Act was amended to include a ban on sex selection of embryos, he said.

""We don''t offer these services anymore and we should have removed it from the website, but we didn''t realise that,"" he added. It is learnt that the BMC also objected to the fact that there are no signs put up in the clinic stating that sex selection is banned.

The high-profile case has, meanwhile, focussed attention on the state government''s efforts to check sex selection. While Dr Telang said the authorities had not been aware of the website''s contents till the SC directive, he stressed that the BMC had given a lot of publicity to the Act.

However, Ms Kamayani Bali-Mahabal, who is working on the health and human rights programme of Cehat, said there had not been enough raids on clinics offering sex selection tests and much of the activity was now ""hush-hush"".

Cehat had in fact sent a reminder to the Maharashtra State Commission for Womenâ€”which has set up a vigilance committee to check sex selection testsâ€”to send decoy patients and conduct raids, she added.

State women''s commission officials said it was up to the state government committee set up under the Act to inspect clinics and conduct raids. ""We formed a vigilance panel because we were concerned about the issue,"" T.F. Thekkekara of the commission said. The commission had held workshops for medical practitioners to publicise the Act, she added.

The state government needed to conduct raids and prosecute cases publically, Ms Thekkekara said.

Manmohan Singh, principal secretary of the family welfare department, said the state had registered the highest number of sonography clinics in the country. ""We have prosecuted 19 cases pertaining to the Act and 48 have been filed before various courts,"" he added.

Infertility specialist Dr Hrishikesh Pai, who is attached to Lilavati hospital at Bandra, concurred that the state government had been stringent about implementing the Act.

""We have to maintain records of each and every sonography, there is a lot of paperwork and we have to submit a report to the local ward office every month,"" he said. The authorities were also empowered to conduct surprise checks on clinics, he added.

11,3 more Kalyan councillors arrested,"MUMBAI: The multi-crore scam in the purchase of water pipes by the Kalyan-Dombivili municipal corporation took a serious turn when three more corporators were arrested by the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) on Tuesday and remanded by the court to police custody till July 11.

The trio â€” Ajit Nadkarni (Shiv Sena), Rajan Samant (BJP) and Shankar Patil (Congress) â€” are among the 10 corporators who are accused of taking kickbacks for clearing a deal in 1996 for purchase of pipes worth crores.

All three were members of the then standing committee which had awarded the contract while conveniently overlooking the high costs. It is alleged that the civic body had purchased the pipes at a rate which was over and above the standard rates and had suffered a loss of around Rs 9 crores.

The pipes were purchased for a drinking water scheme in Titwala village.

A complaint that kickbacks were paid and it involved 13 members of the standing committee, three KDMC officials and four contractors was made by a former Sena corporator Waman Mhatre.

Investigations by the ACB bared the scam following which six corporators, including a woman, and one civic officer were arrested for their alleged role in clearing the high-priced tenders.

Those arrested earlier were Jayashree Kulkarni and Uday Samel (Sena), Ramesh Mhatre (Congress) Sopan Nichal, Pundalik Mhatre and Rajendra Deolekar (BJP).

12,DC inspects Dhusi bandh sites,"LUDHIANA: Deputy Commissioner (DC) Anurag Verma and other officers, on Tuesday visited the vulnerable sites on Dhusi bundh along river Sutlej to review the situation and directed all concerned officers of drainage, revenue and police departments to maintain a round-the-clock vigil on release of water from Ropar head works.

The DC began his visit from Dhullewal village, and discussed the situation with the officers and villagers. The villagers informed the DC that the bandh (from RD 76900 to 76800) was built of sand, and the water was flowing too close to it, which could harm the bandh. The DC asked the panchayat to keep a watch even at night and inform the SDM Samrala and control rooms on phone in case of a threat.

The panchayat informed the DC that more than two dozen villages including Dhulewal, Mand Sherian, Ghounsgarh, Road Mazari, Mand Fathegarh, Daulatpur, Milkowal, Issewal, Mand Jharowal, Sherpur, etc. situated near the bandh can be affected, in case of a flood. SDM Samrala said that two evacuation centers, one in Gurdwara Charan Kamal Machhiwara and second at Senior Secondary School Panjgraian, have been selected for housing people in case of an emergency.

When the villagers told the DC that the poor condition of the road to the bandh would impede flood-protection measures and rescue operations, he asked the executive engineer (PWD) to seek immediate sanction of funds for roads connecting Dhulewal to Machhiwara.

Later, the DC inspected all the other vulnerable points downstream on the bandh i.e. Issewal, Ghumana, Kassabad, Mattewra, Jamalpur, Lely, Khera Bet and Madhepur.

The DC asked the executive engineer (drainage) to constantly keep in touch with Ropar head works on the release of water, and to inform all concerned officers, in case much water is to be released so that preventive measures could be taken.

Also, that control rooms at DRO Office Ludhiana (2401352) and in offices of all SDMs have started functioning round-the-clock. He said that a sufficient number of medical teams have been constituted by the health and animal husbandry departments to provide medical facilities to the people and animals, in case of floods.
