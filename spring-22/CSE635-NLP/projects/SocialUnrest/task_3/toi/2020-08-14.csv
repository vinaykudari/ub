0,School teaches respect for law to the young,"PUNE: In a unique experiment, the Pune rural police, along with the Dhyas Foundation, will be involved in running a school for local tribes such as the Kanjarbhat and the Pardhi, to wean them away from anti-social influences.

Addressing a press conference on Thursday, superintendent of police, Pune (rural) Madhav Sanap, said that the experiment was an attempt to reduce the crime rate in the area as well as absorb tribals into the mainstream of society.

The school, Maharshi Valmikhi Vidyavardhni at Alandi, is to be formally inaugurated on August 17. â€œIt will be inaugurated by Nationalist Congress Party president Sharad Pawar and the function will be attended by chief minister Sushilkumar Shinde and deputy chief minister Chhagan Bhujbal, among others,â€� said Sanap.

He said initially the Marathi medium school would have classes up to the fifth standard. There were also plans for expansion at a later date. Sanap explained that for the last two years, the school had been run by a different institute and already had 37 children from different tribes attending classes there.

â€œPlans are afoot to increase their strength by 30 or more,â€� he added. Children from other sections of the society would also be welcome to enrol in the school.

The superintendent of police said incidences of dacoity, especially those in rural Pune, had come down since the school had started. He added that the police would be keeping a check on the progress of the children.

â€œAfter they have settled down and been absorbed in society, we will consider our objective achieved,â€� he said.

1,"Why is govt harassing us, ask tense students","BANGALORE: Students aspiring to be doctors and engineers in Karnataka have never had it so bad. The government''s decision to nullify the admission process through CET following the SC''s order on revising the seat matrix, has left both parents and students shattered and confused.

""My son who secured 72 per cent has got an engineering seat at BMS college of engineering. Now, in the re-admission process, we are not sure whether he will get a seat in the same college,'''' said a tense S. Ramachar from Hanumanthnagar in Bangalore. Madhu J., who secured a seat in the subject of his choice â€” electronics â€” at R.V. College of Engineering, is shattered.

"" The happiest moment of my life was when I got a seat in Bangalore. I may now get thrown into some college in a far-flung district. I am so upset,'''' the 19-year-old said. Students and parents blame the government''s failure in resolving the issue. ""The government should have waited for the final SC order before commencing the admission process through the CET cell.

After admitting them on a 75:25 basis, they now want to cancel it and begin re-admission. Why is this government bent on harassing parents and students so much? It is criminal,'''' Seema Rao, a parent, said. Immediately on hearing the court''s verdict, parents began contacting private engineering and medical college managements for securing a seat for their wards.

""I have called several colleges because I am not sure if my daughter will be selected in the re-admission process. They openly ask for Rs 3-4 lakh donation for an MBBS seat. I don''t earn that much in one year. How can I pay,'''' said Manavaimaran, whose daughter got admission in Mangalore.

Managements jubilant

Private college managements affiliated to the Consortium of Medical, Engineering and Dental Colleges (Comed) feel their stand has been vindicated with the Supreme Court order fixing 50-50 seat-sharing formula between the government and managements. Comed chairman R.L. Jalappa said college managements will abide by the apex court order. â€œWe are yet to receive the full text.

Though we are happy with the 50-50 seat-sharing formula, we need to get a clear picture about the fee and other management quota details.â€™â€™ A Comed meeting is likely on August 18 to discuss the SC order, its implications and the fee structure. Comed will submit its accounts to a committee on free structure to finalise the fee. On the SC banning capitation fee, Jalappa said colleges will not be required to collect capitation fee if the fee structure is reasonable.

â€œHowever, we cannot accept the Karnataka high court fee structure for the management quota. All this will be discussed at the meeting,â€™â€™ he said. Reacting to the order, vice-chairman M.R. Jayaram said: â€œThe order has been delivered by a five-judge bench and it will be the law of land.â€™â€™ After reading the ruling, managements will take a decision on the fee structure.

3,"50:50 quota for seats, rules SC","NEW DELHI: The final verdict is out. For the 2003-04 session, the managements and governments will each have a quota of 50 per cent seats in professional colleges. This formula will be reviewed by a four-member panel under a retired high court judge and its recommendations will come into force from next year.

The Supreme Court ruling, delivered by a Bench headed by Chief Justice V.N. Kharge on Thursday, clarifies an earlier judgment. Justice Sinha delivered a separate 126-page verdict on the issue. On the contentious issue of fixing management quota for private and unaided minority educational institutions, the Bench said the committee would determine it keeping in mind the local needs.

Even for management quota, a common entrance test (CET) should be held. Even in admitting students under the management quota, the institutions could not ignore merit. â€œThe need of that community, in the state, would be paramount vis-a-vis the local needs,â€™â€™ the court said.

The seats falling vacant under the management quota would go to candidates passing the CET conducted by the respective state governments, the court added. The court said non-minority professional colleges are not on the same footing as unaided minority educational institutions in view of Article 31 of the Constitution. The unaided minority institutes have a right to admit students of their community or linguistic group but the quota will be fixed by the committee keeping in mind the requirement of the area in which the institution is functioning.

However, seats meant for minorities, if not filled completely, should be given to candidates qualifying in the CET conducted by that particular state. The court said private unaided or minority institutions imparting technical and medical education could decide their own fee structure but it must be scrutinised by a committee headed by a retired high court judge in each state. The fee committee includes a chartered accountant, a doctor or an engineer depending on the nature of the college, the secretary of medical education or technical education of the state government and an eminent personality of the state.

The committee could fix a fee structure valid for three years. Only after three years can the institution approach the panel again for revision. The Bench also said no institution could charge fees for the entire four- or five-year course. The Bench ruled that no professional institution can charge capitation fees from students seeking admission, saying imparting of education is â€œessentially charitable in natureâ€™â€™.

It said governments should consider framing appropriate regulations and cancel recognition and affiliation of a professional college if found â€œcharging capitation fee or indulging in profiteering. Until Parliament enacts a law to this effect, the judgment would be implemented under Article 141 of the Constitution, which mandates every authority, civil or military, to ensure implementation of the courtâ€™s orders.

4,No-trust move catches govt by surprise,"NEW DELHI: Leader of Opposition Sonia Gandhi''s notice for a vote of no-confidence against the Vajpayee government -- the first in the 13th Lok Sabha -- caught the government by ""surprise"" on Thursday, parliamentary affairs minister Sushma Swaraj admitted.

And while she said the government was ""100 per cent confident"" the motion would be defeated, the notice has, sent the government scurrying to mobilise its NDA allies.

Indeed, an NDA meeting will be called soon to discuss the motion, which is to be taken up on Monday at 12 noon to culminate the following day with voting at 6 pm.

The vote of no-confidence, the Congress admits privately, poses no threat to the government, nor is it intended to: A senior Congress MP said, ""A vote of no-confidence has two purposes -- one, to replace the government; the other to place on record the anger and the anguish of the people. Our purpose is the second. It is not our intention to destabilise the government.""

Indeed, it is a device to help the opposition achieve its goal, sources said, of getting the Prime Minister to reply to a variety of issues, including defence purchases, which the government had refused to agree to when the discussion demanded had focussed simply on that subject. It also brings to an ""honourable"" end the impasse in the Lok Sabha over the PAC issue.

Indeed, the notice appears to be the logical culmimation of the growing confrontation between the government and the opposition, witnessed during the current session of Parliament: With elections in the air, Parliament has seen an aggressive opposition putting the government on the mat on issues varying from Ayodhya, to the CBI''s apparent ""burial'' of the Babri Masjid demolition case against senior members of the BJP-led government, the Taj corridor controversy and finally defence purchases. There has been no effort at compromise or a search for common ground between the two adversaries.

But the strongly worded letter written by Rajya Sabha opposition MPs to chairperson Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, reminding him that the chair ""is above politics and never takes a stand on issues which are essentially political,'' and their threat to boycott the house next week appears to have shaken the government: On Thursday, in a conciliatory bid, Swaraj spoke to Leader of the Congress in the RS Manmohan Singh and others saying a stage should not be reached where all ""communication'' between the government and opposition gets blocked.

This came after the RS''s Business Advisory Committee -- intended to discuss next week''s business -- meeting on Thursday was cancelled. Swaraj told the RS MPs that when the BAC meets on Monday, the government was willing again to consider the question of a discussion on defence purchases again.ends
