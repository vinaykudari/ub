0,"No more higher prices for cotton, says minister","mumbai: state finance minister jayantrao patil said that the government would buy cotton from growers only at the market price from the next season instead of the earlier practice of procuring cotton at a higher price. he was addressing a conference organised by the indian merchants' chamber here recently. mr patil said procuring cotton at a higher price had placed a heavy burden on the state economy. he admitted that most state governments were in bad financial shape. the old political style of making populist promises to the electorate was no longer sustainable. ``a new type of political leadership, young and dynamic and willing to take tough measures in the larger national interest, was coming to the fore,'' he said. most states in india were committed to introduce value-added tax (vat) from april 2002. many more tax reforms would be introduced in the next two to three years. ``the country needed a broad political consensus on economic reforms. this consensus should be backed by a time-bound decision-making process,'' he said.

2,Seizure of poppy takes political colour,"bathinda:the electioneering in punjab is a good time for tipplers and drug addicts. the smuggling of opium and poppy husk and distillation of illicit liquor for distribution among voters in rural areas is an attractive feature of elections. the seizure of 23 quintals and 10 kg of poppy husk on wednesday in bathinda district has triggered a controversy over the smugglers' link with politicians. one of the smugglers is a wrestler of international fame known for his proximity to politicians. the bathinda police seized two trucks, one car (loaded with poppy husk) and a mobile phone and arrested five persons near sadana village near rampura phool on wednesday while allegedly smuggling drugs from rajasthan. those arrested have been identified as joginder singh and kirpal singh, from villages falling under phillaur police station and dhira singh from badiala village of bathinda. the other accused has been identified as jagdish singh alias bhola(rustam-e-hind, a well-known wrestler), his brother-in-law, kuldeep singh, and his accomplice, sira. the kingpin of the gang, jagdish singh bhola, fled from the scene. though the district police claimed that it was investigating the case and the antecedents of the accused, but the opposition parties have started throwing barbs at the sad(b) for having connections with the accused and smuggling drugs to be supplied among villagers to woo them. seeking a cbi probe, baldev singh khayala, a senior leader of panthic morcha alleged that the main accused, jagdish singh bhola, was known for his proximity to many akali leaders. baldev singh khayala is sitting mla from joga constituency in the area. he alleged that once electioneering started, the sad(b) leaders started suppyling drugs to youths and addicts in rural areas to win them over. the district police chief said the police had stopped a truck at a naka on the night of january 15 on sadhana bridge near rampura phul. a check yielded 50 bags of poppy husk. however, one person stepped down from the truck and escaped in a jeep, he was later identified as jagdish singh alias bhola. in another case, a truck was also impounded by the police, and 16 bags of poppy husk recovered from the possession of mahesh kumar and kewal krishan, who were arrested by the police. if past trends are taken into consideration, the open sale of liquor may well decrease during the next couple of days. candidates either use illicit liquor or get truckloads of imfl smuggled in from other states to keep their supporters in good spirits.

5,"Talks between govt, PW urged","hyderabad: the committee of concerned citizens (ccc), an independent body striving to resolve the decades-old naxalite problem in the state, has urged the people's war naxalite group and the government to shun violence and initiate a dialogue to end hostilities. the ccc, in a press release here on wednesday, has asked both the parties to observe 'truce' — stop killing each other from the second week of february for a period of at least three months to create mutual trust and inspire confidence among the people. to begin the process of dialogue, the ccc has prescribed six suggestions each to the government and the pw. it wanted the government to stop encounters, combing operations, all forms of harassment, all tactics not in accordance with law, and review cases against villagers, and permit non-violent, peaceful and democratic activities, irrespective of political ideology. on the other hand, the ccc asked the people's war to stop killings, of police, alleged informers and political activists, stop attacking police stations and destruction of public properties, use of landmines, and other explosives, extortions, interfering with democratic aactivities of any political party/group, and stop actions which gives an impression that development, administrative and welfare activities are being obstructed. the committee feared that the recent action of police in which four naxalites were killed in an alleged encounter at hanamkonda and the killing of congress legislator d ragya naik by the naxalites would vitiate the atmosphere set in in both the government and the naxalite group to have a dialogue. the ccc desires that both the sides respond positively to the proposal for a dialogue before the situation further worsens, the press release issued by ccc convener s r sankaran said.

6,Teegala dubs MIM as communal party,"hyderabad: the telugu desam party mayoral candidate teegala krishna reddy has dubbed the majlis ittehadul muslimeen (mim) as communal party which is dividing people on the lines of religion to secure votes rather than projecting its dismal performance in the development of the city. addressing a meet-the-press programme organised by the andhra pradesh union of working journalists here on wednesday, the tdp mayoral candidate said despite being elected to parliament and the assembly several times, the mim members made no efforts to develop their respective constituencies. people are vexed with the dismal performance of the mim party, he said. krishna reddy said the government had spent about rs 70 crore for taking up various developmental activities in the city. listing the achievements and also plans in store for the city, krishna reddy said the tdp government achieved more results than the congress party, which was in power for 35 years. even andhra pradesh congress committee president sathyanarayana rao conceded that their party has become very weak and it needs to be streamlined. stating that the tdp-bjp combine would not increase property tax, drinking water charges or even the electricity bills, krishna reddy said tax collection in hyderabad is the least compared to other cities in the country. when asked if the still under construction flyover at tankbund reflects the dismal performance of the hyderabad urban development authority (huda) under his chairmanship, krishna reddy maintained that lack of knowledge about existence of a water pipeline laid by the nizams delayed the construction. the diversion of the pipeline costs huda another rs 1.5 crore and this lead to the delay in the completion of the project. however, the flyover would be completed in another four months time, he said. if elected i would strive for rooting out corruption in the mch by involving the people wherever possible to maintain the transparency, krishna reddy promised.

15,Govt rules out petro product price hike,"new delhi: government on thursday ruled out any increase in prices of petroleum products before the presentation of the general budget for 2002-03. ""there is no possibility of any changes, neither increase or decrease, in the petroleum product prices till the budget is presented by the finance minister on febraury 28,"" petroleum minister ram naik told reporter here. government proposes to bring down subsidy on kerosene and cooking gas (lpg) to 33 and 15 per cent respectively from the current levels of 40 and 37 per cent from april 1, 2002. any changes in prices of these two mass consumed cooking medium, if at all necessary to bring down subsidy to residual levels as envisaged in the roadmap for dismantling of the administered pricing mechanism (apm) by march 31, 2002, would be a part of the general budget for the next fiscal, he said. bringing down subsidy on kerosene to 33 per cent, without change in duty structure, would mean an increase of rs 0.70-75 per litre while the same on lpg would mean an increase of rs 90 per cylinder. though subsidy on kerosene would be brought down to the residual level of 33 per cent from next fiscal, that on cooking gas (lpg) could not be reduced to 15 per cent as envisaged in the 1997 cabinet decision on deregulation of petroleum sector, he said. naik, however, was quick to add that government would not be required to resort to price increase of kerosene to reduce subsidy if international crude prices remain low and/or excise duty changes are affected.

16,Sabarimala pilgrimage ends on a riotous note,"thiruvananthapuram: in spite of the government's promise of making `foolproof' arrangements for the sabarimala pilgrimage, the aiyappa devotees on the concluding day of the season on monday found traffic in pampa all messed up. some irate devotees from andhra pradesh went on a rampage, damaging several ksrtc vehicles and offices. to prevent the traffic jam on the makaravilakku, the day when the deity is dressed up in traditional attire and a ""divine light"" appears on the hill top, the police prevented parking of private vehicles at pampa (sabari's base). instead, the vehicles were to be terminated at nilackal, 22 km away. as the devotees in droves began the return journey, they found very few ksrtc buses to ferry them to nilackal. adding to this was a sudden, inexplicable police action of changing the traffic routes. this prevented ksrtc buses coming back to the stand. the weary pilgrims waited all night at the pampa bus stand but only three buses turned up. the devotees went on a rampage and damaged several vehicles and government cabins. among those who experienced the kerala government's ineptitude was guru sachinarayana, mp from hanamkonda constituency. his vehicle too was made to park at nilackal. he was told the ksrtc runs a ""chain service"" and he would have no problem getting back. but the chain service broke and he found himself stranded along with his fellow devotees. he got in touch with the andhra pradesh chief minister chandrababu naidu over the mobile phone and the latter in turn called up kerala chief minister a.k. antony. the cm had no clue of the mess up at pampa. he asked the police chief to do something. but nothing happened. ""it seems the unscientific traffic system caused the confusion,"" remarked transport minister k.b. ganesh kumar. police chief w. joseph dawson said the sudden rush of thousands of pilgrims appeared to have generated difficulties. one of the two inspectors general of police posted at sabarimala for `smooth functioning' said the central government's refusal to give forest land for parking vehicles at pampa was at the cause of the traffic problem in sabarimala. again, most devotees these days come on their own or hire private vehicles and thousands stay back to witness makaravilakku, the last day of the two-month-long sabarimala pilgrimage. all this contributes to the heavy rush on the last day. three years ago a similar mess-up resulted in a stampede and which claimed the lives of 52 devotees, most of them from ap and tamil nadu.

17,Indian laws could be China's gain,"mumbai: while the events of 9-11 have spurred several countries to formulate special laws to fight terrorism, china hasn't felt the need to do so, a delegation of chinese lawyers that was in mumbai recently said. china's prevailing laws, coupled with the ministry of public security, are adequate to fight terrorism, said fu yang, vice-president of the all china lawyers association. he told the times news network that his country's judicial system was formed only 20 years ago. mr yang and eight other lawyers were in india on a week-long visit to learn about the indian legal system. they were part of chinese premier zhu rongji's entourage. they visited the bombay high court and had a discussion with chief justice c.k. thakker that touched upon such topics as laws relating to administration and justice, human rights and even public interest litigation. ``what is common in the two countries is that, like india, we too have a four-level court structure that starts with basic courts (county level), intermediate courts and goes on to high courts and the supreme court,'' mr yang said over a chinese lunch. he said that the delegates were aiming to enhance their knowledge about the indian legal system, as well as to gather ideas about how best to modify the laws back home. with trade barriers coming down in the wake of china's admission to the world trade organisation, corporate legal interactivity between the two countries is likely to increase. lalit bhasin, general secretary of the bar association of india, said the simplicity of laws in china had become one of its biggest strengths. he said burgeoning trade and commerce activities required lawyers in both countries to cooperate more closely. the chinese lawyers' delegation, which also included peng xue feng, vice president of the beijing lawyers association, had earlier met with president k.r. narayanan, chief justice of india s.p. bharucha and union law minister arun jaitley.

18,Auto fuel policy is behind the times,"mumbai: just how much of an impact will the auto fuel policy, recently formulated by the union cabinet, have on mumbai's air pollution levels? a comparison of the policy's pollution norms with those recommended by other expert bodies shows that the policy is actually behind the times. even mumbai's own v.m.lal committee, set up by the high court to recommend measures for improving vehicular pollution in the city, had suggested deadlines for implementing pollution norms well in advance of those proposed by the policy in its april 2000 report. the auto fuel policy, which was formulated on the recommendations of a committee headed by r.a. mashelkar, director general of the council of scientific and industrial research, sets euro-ii vehicle emission norms in the country by april 1, 2005. it also sets euro-iii equivalent emission norms for all categories of vehicles (excluding two- and three-wheelers) in the seven mega cities from april 1, 2004, to be extended to other parts of the country from 2010. in contrast, the lal committee had asked for euro-ii norms for the whole country by 2000 and, most importantly, euro-iv norms for the whole country by april, 2005. (these norms provide for tighter vehicle emission norms, as a strategy to bring down vehicular and air pollution levels.) by doing so, the lal committee had envisaged ``leapfrogging'' the intermittent stage of euro-iii, to catch up with europe's stringent environmental standards. europe now complies with euro-iii norms and is expected to move into the next stage in a few years. ``even though it is now 2002, and the deadlines would necessarily be pushed back, the same principle should apply,'' says an environmentalist. ``the recommendations were based on the fact that industry kept telling us that there was no point in improving technology incrementally,'' says a former member of the lal committee. ``..that it was better to have clearly defined goal posts, and go for the most exacting standrad, since it would be useless to invest in technology and machinery which would become obsolete in a few years.'' similarly, refineries would also have to keep upgrading to fulfill fuel specifications. just to upgrade to euro-ii, the mashelkar committee says, would entail an investment of rs 17,000 crore in the oil industry, while refining fuel to euro-iii norms could cost rs 35,000 crore. the mashelkar committee report has recommended that the government provide fiscal benefits to the domestic oil and auto industry to help them offset these huge investments. apart from the lal committee, the auto fuel policy norms fall short of those suggested by another goverment commission, and even the recommendations of an auto industry report. the road map 2000 of the society of indian automobile manufacturers, for example, suggests the industry could achieve euro-iii and euro-iv standards by 2004 and 2007 respectively, with euro-iv for commercial vehicles by 2008. these are still ahead of the auto fuel policy's deadlines. the inter-ministerial task force on fuel quality and vehicular emission specifications, which submitted its report in march 2001, goes a step ahead. it recommends euro-iv by 2005, failing which they could implement euro-iii with ultra-low sulphur diesel in the six big cities of delhi, mumbai, kolkata, chennai, bangalore and hyderabad. in addition, the mashelkar committee recommends that the sulphur content in euro-iii diesel and petrol be reduced to 350 and 150 parts per million respectively and the proportion of poisonous aromatics reduced to 45 per cent. but dismayed environmentalists say these norms are too lax. local campaigners consider the policy a ``cop out'', a report rushed through the cabinet (it was submitted on january 2 and cleared barely a week after) to suit the petroleum ministry. they point out that since euro ii is already in force in delhi and mumbai, there will be no change till 2005. even state transport officials say the ``gap between the deadlines for better norms in cities and the rest of the country is too long''. what worries local environmental campaigners most, however, is what the policy means for the current spate of conversions to compressed natural gas (cng). since the policy proposes that the government only lay down the emission standards and fuel specifications without dictating the type of technology or fuel to be used, the state government could use this to resist cng conversions. however, campaigners say that since the bombay high court has already passed orders on phaseouts and conversions for old polluting vehicles, it is unlikely to go back on existing deadlines. ``conversions will continue unless the courts dictate otherwise,'' confirms a transport commissionerate representative. adds an environmentalist, ``much will now depend on what happens in the supreme court, and what it decides in the petition on vehicular pollution in delhi.''

19,`Sons-of-the-soil' party denies ditching Sena,"mumbai: sthaneeya lokadhikar samiti mahasangh (slsm) general secretary arun betkekar on thursday stated that his organisation would ``wholeheartedly work for the success of shiv sena candidates in the bmc elections''. ``the slsm is a part and parcel of the shiv sena and there is no question of it not working for the party,'' he said. it may be recalled that senior functionaries of the samiti, on condition of anonymity, had confided to a times news network correspondent their intentions to stay away from the poll campaign. they explained that they were upset with the sena leadership, who they claimed, had ignored the cause of the sons of the soil. that despite the sena's strong presence in the union government with as many as three ministers in the central cabinet they had failed to address the slsm suggestions and grievances related to the banking sector and the public sector undertakings. mr betkekar, however, disputed this and said, ``it is possible that the statement was made by some people who might have some ulterior motives and not by a slsm member''. mr betkekar claimed, ``the slsm has never had any grievance about the union ministers not paying heed to our suggestions. as a matter of fact the ministers and mps have been very cooperative and have always lent their helping hand whenever the issues of local people were placed before them''. disagreeing with the statement made by a samiti functionary that the indigenous citizen of mumbai is neglected in the banking sector and the psu, mr betkekar said, ``it is not true to say that since the slsm has received very good response in both these sectors and has been able to get jobs and various benefits for the sons of the soil in these sectors as well''.
