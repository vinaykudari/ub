1,Girl’s protest leads to father’s death,"new delhi: sixteen-year-old preetpal kaur has just one regret. when a hoodlum of vishnu garden chose to shower expletives for no apparent reason, she could not hold back her anger. she responded by spitting. two days later, she wishes she hadn't. it was her involuntary act of revulsion which cost her father his life. the incident happened on tuesday at about 8 pm when preetpal was returning from the market after buying a loaf of bread. ''mindra, a local property dealer, was standing in the lane outside our house. as soon as he saw me, he started passing obscene remarks. i was so sick of his behaviour that i spat on the road,'' says preetpal. this apparently enraged mindra and he started showering her with unmentionable profanities. she came home and told her mother about mindra's behaviour. thirty-nine-year-old paramjeet reportedly strode out in anger, her 45-year-old husband amreek singh following on her heels, and started arguing with mindra. nobody knows exactly what happened or who started the fight. bobby, a 32-year-old body-builder who runs a gym on the floor above the singhs' residence, ran down after hearing sounds of a scuffle and saw mindra and his associates raining blows on amreek. unable to offer resistance and weakened by a recent illness, singh collapsed within minutes as his wife looked on helplessly. ''we took him to deen dayal upadhyay hospital around 8.30 pm where he was declared dead on arrival,'' says bobby. the accused is a local property dealer mindra and two of his employees — amarjeet thulla and satinder singh tona — notorious hoodlums known for creating nuisance in the area. mindra allegedly assaulted a schoolteacher recently but no case was filed. all three are in police custody and have been charged with culpable homicide. amreek singh's widow and three children are unsure of the future. with the main breadwinner gone, the family is worried about how long they will be allowed to stay in the tiny, two-room rented accommodation.

4,Cauvery Tribunal meet inconclusive,"new delhi: if tamil nadu was hoping that the special meeting of the cauvery river water authority monitoring committee meeting on thursday would finally mean release of water for its standing crops in the cauvery river delta, it was in for some disappointment. the talks held here which were chaired by union water resources secretary b.n. navalawala failed to come up with a solution to the complaint by tamil nadu about inadequate release of water by karnataka. while tamil nadu is seeking release of more water in accordance with the interim award of the cauvery water disputes tribunal, karnataka told the meeting it simply wasn't in a position to do so in view of deficient rainfall. according to ministry officials, for the three months of june, july and august, while karnataka was supposed to release 107.64 tmcft to tamil nadu, the latter got only 49.35 tmcft. at thursday's meeting, both tamil nadu and karnataka were represented by their chief secretaries, p. shankar and teresa bhattacharya, respectively. also present at the meeting were officials from kerala and pondicherry, the other comprising the four riparian states. yet another meeting of the authority is expected to be held in five days in order to review the situation.

5,"Restrict import of unsafe food items, govt. urged","mumbai: the consumer education and research centre (cerc) has urged the union agriculture ministry not to allow unrestricted import of food items without proper health and quality checks at entry points. it also advised consumers not to buy any imported food unless they conformed to indian food standards and carried a ``genetically modified (gm)-free'' label. ``without giving much attention to systems needed to ensure quality, like testing for communicable diseases and proper labelling, the government is hastily allowing these imports,'' cerc said in a statement and warned that considering the prevalence of mad cow disease in europe the issue was very serious. it said that the government had been allowing a whole lot of meat items under the free trade list and then making sanitary permit mandatory, adding that at the same time, fish and other seafood products were being exempted from such a permit. ``one doesn't understand the logic behind the exemption, since fish and other seafood may be contaminated with mercury and other pollutants,'' it added. cerc also referred to genetically-modified imported food items and their safety. gm technology allows shifting of genes from totally unrelated species to bring about characteristics like increased yield, taste, pest-resistance etc. cerc said that in a clear violation of the provisions of the prevention of food adulteration act (pfa), most imported packaged foodstuff was being allowed to be sold without giving the consumer full information. some product lables are not even in english, let alone indian languages. greenpeace india has tested isomil baby food and pringles' potato chips and has found them positive for genetically engineered ingredients. as isomil is meant for infants, the manufactuer, abbott laboratories, should have indicated its gm-status, cerc said. procter and gamble of japan has recalled 800,000 units of pringles chips, largely consumered by children, after it was discovered that they contained unapproved genetically-modified potatoes. pringles is imported into india and sold without any label regarding its gm status. cerc called upon the government to see that gm food products without proper labels were not allowed to be sold in the country. india should not be a ``convenient dumping ground for these foods because of our lax regulations,'' it added.

6,MCH unable to contain congress grass menace,"hyderabad: exotic plants, which are causing allergy and diseases, have become a big menace. though the municipal corporation of hyderabad (mch) had launched a special drive to clear these plants, the problem persists. parthenium hysterphorous, locally called 'congress grass' or 'vayyari bhama', or 'carrot weed' has spread extensively in the city. this plant which came in wheat bought from mexico in 1956 spread all over the country. the plant can grow in all types of soils and climate, including drought conditions and in wetlands. these plants have high productive capacity in terms of seed which is up to one lakh seed per plant. this capacity is said to be main reason for the fast spreading of this species. the touch of the leaves causes skin allergies. according to mch officials, this plant is found in almost all open spaces in the shrub growth in the city. a paediatrician in the osmania general hospital, dr g suneel kumar reddy, said a number of children also are being brought to the hospital with complaint of allergies caused by the plant. ""people are being advised to weed out the plant from their surrounding areas,"" he said. another exotic plant that has spread in almost all the water bodies in the city is water hyacinth, locally called 'gurrapu dekka'. this plant was first brought to india as an ornamental plant in 1896 from brazil by a visitor. this weed has become a big problem in water bodies. the mch every year spends lakhs of rupees for removing these plants all over the city. however, prosopis juliflora, locally called as 'sarkar thumma', has not been so problematic. it was introduced in andhra pradesh from south america in 1877 by a forest officer col beddome. even though it has spread like a weed, due to its enormous coppice power it has become good source of fuel, timber and charcoal. ""the spread of these plants was curtailed as they were used as fuel by people,"" said an mch official.

8,Rotting foodgrains leave little space for fresh stock,"chandigarh: even as the paddy procurement season is fast approaching, the punjab government is yet to empty its granaries which are filled mostly with rotting foodgrains. the akali regime can do little except ask the centre to bail it out in an election year. going by the current rate at which the wheat stock is being moved, it would take nearly three years before godowns, which hold a staggering 1.5 crore metric tonnes of wheat, can be emptied completely. for example, 74.2 lakh metric tonnes of wheat procured this year is still lying in various state government godowns. official sources said that almost 60 per cent of this wheat is black, which means the grains have a damaged outer layer and are hence of dubious nutritive value. when procurement began early this year, reports stated that not only was the crop damaged but in many instances it was almost 100 per cent black. the state government, however, continued with the procurement and requested the centre in may to relax procurement norms so that even 100 per cent blackened grain could be procured. replying in july, the centre said that it was permitting only 50 per cent relaxation of norms. by then, all the wheat had been procured. the state government is now in a quandary: on one hand, the food corporation of india (fci) is reluctant to pick up the grains, and, on the other hand, its godowns are full and there is no space available for storing the forthcoming paddy crop. the state government is yet to respond to the centre after the july missive. till this issue is resolved, the state government will continue to be dogged with the burden of procured grain. this is not all. most of the grain stored in the state is not saleable. for example, the punjab state warehousing corporation (pswc) is still saddled with 2,277 tonnes of wheat procured in 1995-96. there are no buyers for this wheat and pswc does not have the right to dispose all of it. this figure went up steadily and, at the moment, pswc alone has five lakh metric tonnes of wheat procured between 1995-96 and 1999-2000. the crop procured seven years ago is now not fit even for animal consumption and pswc has asked its board for permission to dispose all of it. in fact, almost 15 per cent of the wheat stored in the state is two to six years old. if 60 per cent of the wheat procured this year is bad, one can imagine what the state of the grain procured seven years ago will be. the state government's repeated pleas to the centre that the procurement norms for paddy be fixed in ""consultation"" with it leads to suspicion that all is not well with the forthcoming paddy crop. punjab has also asked the centre to advance paddy procurement by 15 days from october 1.

9,Corruption in buildings dept: Gujarat govt,"gandhinagar: what was till recently hearsay is now official. the gujarat government has admitted to the ""practice of collective corruption"" in the process of constructing buildings under instructions from engineers of the roads and buildings (r&b) department. a government resolution, dated august 20, 2001, issued by the r&b department, no. tnc-10-2000 -ib-118-(11)-s, and signed by deputy secretary r b pandit, says, ""consciously and with intention, wrong bills are prepared, and everyone from small officers right up to the departmental engineers resort to serious irregularities."" the resolution has been issued in the context of the need to properly implement the state vigilance commission guidelines as mentioned in its bulletin which, it says, ""should be sent to all small and big officers for perusal"". it insists: ""often, with evil intention, work is shown as having been completed on paper and huge sums are paid against them. some jobs are not even carried out. some work is qualitatively extremely weak and of poor standard."" the resolution says, ""these irregularities take place not because of any omissions. they are the result of conscious well-calculated decisions."" senior minister nitin patel, at present holding partial charge of the roads and buildings department, was not available for comment. r&b secretary h p jamdar, expressing surprise over the resolution, said, ""it has been poorly drafted."" jamdar added, ""i do not understand why such a thing is done by anyone."" pandit, when contacted, refused to comment, saying so many resolutions are drafted under him that he would have to look into files to check up facts.

10,"Mizo government, BNLF to hold talks","aizawl: a four-member delegation of the bru national liberation front led by zaithanga arrived here thursday night for the first round of talks with the mizoram government on several issues. the delegation includes bru welfare association of mizoram's president biakmawia and general secretary t vanlalzuava alongwith capt r s ushoi, capt t d joy and lt g s molshoi, officials said. the state government delegation will be led by the chief secretary h v lalringa. officials of the home department, police and district administration of aizawl and mamit districts will also be part of he delegation, they said. bru national liberation front is an armed reang bru outfit demanding a separate autonomous district council by carving out the north-western belt of the state adjoining tripura. the outcome of the talks would be crucial as the mizoram government insists that the repatriation process of the brus, lodged in six refugee camps in north tripura, would not be undertaken unless bnlf cadres lay down arms and joins the mainstream. the proposed talks fizzled out in mid-june due to the insistence of the outfit that representatives of the union home ministry or top official of the subsidiary intelligence bureau here should be involved in the talks the bru national liberation front, however, was finally persuaded by the three-member government emissary led by rev. lalsawma, a church leader, that the issues to be discussed between the two parties were purely state subjects.

11,Sarkar for holistic development of tribals,"agartala: tripura chief minister manik sarkar has urged the centre to take up a holistic development programme to ensure rapid uplift of the entire tribal population in the country. ""the most backward section of our society are the tribals who number seven to eight crore,"" sarkar said at the 49th meeting of the national development council held in new delhi on september 1. ""over the years, a lot has been said about their welfare and development, but it needs to be recognised that the objective has not yet been realised up to the desired level,"" he said. the time had come to take up development programmes on time bound basis to ensure rapid uplift of the tribal population, sarkar said. such programme should attempt to improve and develop the economic life, education and health of tribals, beside promoting their social and cultural traditions and habits and ensure their democratic rights, he said. the chief minister said while formulating the plan, proper assessment should be made for finalisation of the strategy for planning and development. states may be grouped into three categories like advanced, less advanced and backward, he said, adding they should be given adequate assistance from the centre.

12,"Finance, power, law secretaries discuss Dabhol","new delhi: even as prime minister atal bihari vajpayee promised every effort by his government to broker an ""amicable solution"" to the blocked dabhol power project, union finance secretary ajit kumar convened yet another meeting here on friday with his power and law counterparts and representatives of financial institutions to discuss an acceptable (to the union) response to enron corporation's offer of sale of its majority equity in dabhol. vajpayee was speaking at a meeting with his advisory council on trade and industry, to check the depressed economic climate. he had, earlier, said he'd like to see something substantial in the works before he leaves for his us trip later this month. at an earlier meeting convened by ajit kumar some weeks before, the fis (their team is led by industrial development bank of india) were asked to see if they could recommend an acceptable way of raising the rs 11 bn needed to complete phase-ii of the stuck project, to clear the way for a sale by enron to third parties, since the union doesn't wish to spend any of its own money. enron has a 65 per cent stake in the project's rs 100 bn equity; fellow transnational firms, bechtel and ge have another 10 per cent each. the rest is with the maharashtra state electricity board, which has locked horns with enron, leading to the dabhol unit's closure. there are also a host of lenders to the project, who've put in double the equity amount. quite a few of them are willing to put in more money to complete phase-ii, but they'd like the equity holders to reciprocate, too. with enron insisting on pulling out if it doesn't get a quick solution to its standoff with mseb, the union is stuck with the problem. and is firm in not wanting to spend any of its money. the fis will be meeting again with the three union secretaries (the latter have been told to prepare the details of an acceptable recommendation), but the likely solution will have to, official say, incorporate something on the new rate of sale of dabhol power, the issue which led to the famous standoff.

15,Silk farms may be privatised,"bangalore: the state government is planning to privatise over 2,000 acres of silk farms to boost production. speaking to reporters after a 10-day three-country tour to study the practices in silk production, sericulture minister m. mahadev said he was inspired by the cooperative society holdings in thailand, where a group of women leased and managed large tracts of land for silk farming. ``though it is still in the idea stage, i will discuss with chief minister krishna and finalise the plan. a note on the subject is being prepared. we plan to give the lands on lease; it can also be given to unemployed youth.'' the government will remove restrictions on raw silk producers and cocoon makers by amending relevant legislation. ``this will also cut down the role of middlemen and provide free and direct unrestricted access to farmers. the amendment will be tabled in the legislature session.'' mahadev said he will write to the centre to increase import duty on silk and to either ban export of silk waste or increase export duty. ``there is not enough silk waste available for the domestic market while producers export what they have. we want to curb this.'' of the things he learnt on his tour to japan, china and thailand, he wanted to replicate many in the state, including improvement of quality. ``i would like to bring in japanese machinery which will not only boost production but also improve the quality of the finished product.''

16,Jagmohan briefs tourism policy amid hazards,"new delhi: jagmohan's maiden news conference as union tourism minister on friday ran into a brief storm in a tea-cup, raising question as to how a public relations agency could gain a foothold in the ministry. invitations to the press conference at the itdc-run ashoka hotel, supposed to be a curtain-raiser on a 'tourism conclave' from september 10 to 12, had been issued by the pr agency, apparently without informing the new minister. he acknowledged immediately, ""i am not aware of it"", and left the responsibility of explanations to a combative new director-general of tourism, v k duggal. duggal said the agency had been hired for a month, as a ""tester"". describing the use of pr agencies as a marketing tool, he said the concept was not new to the tourism sector. hiring a pr agency for news conferences addressed by a cabinet minister hasn't been the usual practice. the govrnment's pib officers, attached to ministries, handle the job, was duggal's explanation. however, the minister made it all too clear that the latest tourism policy draft is unlikely to take final shape at a meeting of chief ministers scheduled on the last day of the conclave. ""it represents a particular line of thinking at present,"" he said, adding that he is yet to formulate his own views into a policy which can be modified, if necessary. the draft, circulated to all states, ministries and industry sections, will be put up for discussion during the three-day meeting. after that, it will be sent to the cabinet and be placed before parliament and made a government document which all departments are supposed to implement. referring to vajpayee's speech on august 15, which had a reference to tourism, jagmohan said the government wanted to give a great push to this sector ^ inescapably, there were references to his clean-up job at vaishnodevi and attempts to rejuvenate culturally-significant towns like varanasi. ""the ministry by itself can not boost tourism; there has to be an integrated effort for a healthy environment,"" he said. tourism secretary m p bezbaruah, explaining the basics of the draft, said the attempt was to indicate a concrete action plan, listing some of the work to be done by each ministry. the agenda focuses on infrastructure, brand building, liberalisation of the visa regime and the indian skies, upgradation of airport infrastructure, rationalisation of tax structures and integrated development of islands. india, with its share of world tourists pegged at a stagnant 0.38 per cent of the total, has a lot of work to do.

17,"Orissa govt edgy as Centre, governor look for truth","bhubaneswar: after making vain efforts to distract national attention from the hunger deaths in kashipur, the naveen patnaik government appears to be facing a severe crisis of confidence. governor m m rajendran is believed to have asked senior ias officer arun kumar samantray to study the situation and submit a report to him. the governor's step has unnerved the state government, official sources here said adding that efforts are on to dissuade the governor. the governor normally depends on the state machinery for information on any subject. but in this case, he has reportedly expressed his unhappiness over the confusing picture presented by the government. hence, he has decided to send an official to find out the truth, the sources added. this is not all. union food minister shanta kumar had recently expressed his dissatisfaction over the handling of the situation by the state government and expressed a desire to personally visit kashipur. the centre is also thinking of sending an independent team to assess the situation, official sources here said. incidentally, at his press conference on thursday, when chief minister naveen patnaik's attention was drawn to the union food minister's reaction, he shot back saying that it was he who had invited shanta kumar. since reports about the plight of the hungry tribals of kashipur eating mango kernels and wild roots hit the headlines, the state government has been desperately trying to give a twist to the issue. the government issued press statements in delhi and later in bhubaneswar insisting that the deaths were not due to starvation but due to food poisoning. but few are willing to buy the government's version. chief secretary d p bagchi even went to the extent of saying that mango kernel was a ""nutritious food"". and now, minister of state for health debi mishra has come out with a new theory that mango kernel has more vitamins than rice. further, the government has been insisting that there is no dearth of food in the area and labour intensive works are in full swing. all this, ironically, has yielded little result for the government. all that has happened is the strengthening of the suspicion that the people do not have enough food. for example, despite the country-wide outcry, the state government began lifting rice for the food-for-work (ffw) programme for kashipur from the district headquarter town of rayagada only on thursday. prime minister vajpayee, during his visit to orissa last month, had announced supply of three lakh tonnes of rice for undertaking the ffw programmes. a formal order from the centre sanctioning one lakh tonne of rice was received here only on august 29. as attacks on the state government mounted, it requested the food corporation of india (fci) to make an ad hoc release of 1,000 tonnes of rice for kashipur on september 5, on the eve of the cm's visit to kashipur, sources pointed out. interestingly, scores of poor people at kashipur are yet to receive the 'below poverty level' (bpl) cards to buy rice. some fci officials who recently visited kashipur were surprised when villagers at several places wanted their help in getting bpl cards. the sincerity of the government can also be questioned from its failure to appoint a full-time block development officer for kashipur. the government has also faced flak for failing to start the antyodaya scheme in kashipur, the continuing hunger deaths there notwithstanding. sources said the government on thursday sent about 21,000 cards in a mini truck to be distributed to the people on the eve of shanta kumar's visit. kumar is scheduled to inaugurate the antyodaya scheme at kashipur.
