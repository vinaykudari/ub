0,"Goods once sold can be returned, says law","VADODARA: How many people fight back when a shopkeeper refuses to take back a defective pair of shoes and how many feel cowed down by the fine print, â€˜Goods once sold cannot be taken back or exchangedâ€™, on the bills?'' Indeed, such â€˜conditionâ€™ on the cash bill is illegal and can even attract a penalty.

The Union ministry of consumer affairs in 1999 had directed chief ministers to curb the practice of printing stipulations that minimise the choice and violate consumer rights. But the government has not publicised the matter, whereby traders take blissful refuge in â€˜ignorance of the lawâ€™, while consumers feel intimidated.

Most cases of defective goods that reach consumer welfare bodies end up in â€˜settlementâ€™. â€œShopkeepers agree to exchange the goods fearing legal implications. Some shopkeepers are unaware of the law, while some pretend not to know. As it works in their favour most shopkeepers persist with such bills,â€� say consumer activists.

Exchanging a defective piece is still a hard task for most people. Despite having the bill and price tags intact, consumers go through a harrowing experience, when they seek replacement.

â€œRecently, I went to a shop to exchange a shirt I had bought for my son. The shirt collar had hole but the shopkeeper argued he would not replace it as no exchange was allowed, saying the bill had mentioned it. After much persuasion, I managed to exchange it. But it was quite humiliating,â€� recalls Prachi Shah, a housewife. â€œIn India, shopkeepers need to develop a sense of honesty.

They fail to understand that it is a consumerâ€™s right to seek quality. After all we pay for it,â€� says Rachna Gupta, a multimedia professional. Meanwhile, the shopkeepers prefer to be non-committal. â€œI am aware of the law. Our consultant has advised us not to print such condition on the cash memo.

However, we have to exhaust the old stock of cash memos, which bear stipulationsâ€�, says Nishit Jeevan of ''The Shoppe'' â€” a lifestyle store. Another shopkeeper not willing to be named says, â€œThere has been no intimation from the government though I came to know of the law through my chartered accountant.We have stopped using our old cash memos.â€�

1,BJP to showcase development,"LUCKNOW: The BJP plans to bank heavily on the development plank to woo voters for the coming Lok Sabha elections in the state. The strategy is to showcase various achievements of the central government under the leadership of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee along with raising the temple bogey once again.

Addressing a press conference on Saturday, the party incharge Kalraj Mishra said that though BJP would highlight the steps taken for strengthening the state infrastructure in fields like road link and communication, the Ram temple also occupied an equally prominent slot in the election campaign.

â€˜Strong BJP, strong Indiaâ€™ (sashakt Bhajapa sashakt Bharat), would be the slogan of the saffron party, said Mishra. Another slogan would be â€˜Five years versus 50 yearsâ€™, enumerating all that achieved during the five-year tenure of the BJP which could not be achieved during the last 50 years of non-BJP rule, he elaborated. The party, Mishra declared, would contest the parliamentary elections alone in UP this time.

Claiming greater polarisation of votes in favour of the BJP, Mishra said that the prospects of the party were brightest in the coming triangular combat between the BJP on the one side and the SP and the Congress on the other side. The results, he claimed, would be better than the last time. Mishra also declared that the party would shortly launch a detailed programme to mobilise grass-root workers and the masses.

â€œThe idea is to build up the image of the BJP as achievers on the move. We will like to restore public confidence in the party and expand the base,â€� announced Mishra. Towards this end, the party was planning to hold conventions in all parliamentary constituencies, he said.

These conventions, he added, would be attended by top state and national leaders. The list included, among others, MP chief minister Uma Bharati, Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi, Arun Jaitley, Sushma Swaraj, Pramod Mahajan along with well-known names from UP specially Rajnath Singh and Murli Manohar Joshi, who would also take an active part in these party conventions, he said.

2,BJP will continue to rally against Baig,"BANGALORE: The state BJP on Saturday resolved to continue its demand for the resignation of small-scale industries minister R. Roshan Baig for, what they claim, his involvement in the multi-crore stamp paper racket.

Addressing a large rally, state BJP chief Ananth Kumar accused the Krishna government of guarding those involved in the racket, which was bigger than the Bofors scam. â€œWe will not rest till Roshan Baig tenders his resignation.â€™â€™

Defending the Centre on the amount of foodgrains released to the state for drought relief, Kumar said: â€œThe Centre has released nearly 9 lakh tonnes of foodgrains to Karnataka. But the state government has diverted the stocks.â€� Council opposition leader D.H. Shankaramurthy said the government was forced to hand over the stamp paer racket probe to the CBI.

â€œWith pressure mounting from other states, they had no other option but to hand over the scam probe to the CBI,â€� he said. Earlier, the party literally took over some parts of the city during its Bangalore Chalo rally, which commenced at noon. Thousands of party men from across the state converged at the Government Arts College grounds.

A make-shift dais was erected on a tempo for the BJP leaders, including Union minister Basavaraj Patil Yatnal, MLCs B.S Yediyurappa, Ramachandra Gowda and Mukhyamantri Chandru, who spoke at length on the failure of Krishna government in the last four years.

7,Karnataka minister resigns over stamp scam,"BANGALORE: Faced with allegations of links with stamp scam kingpin Abdul Karim Telgi, Karnataka small scale industries minister R Roshan Baig resigned on Sunday. His resignation comes a day before the commencement of the state legislature session.

Chief minister S M Krishna is expected to take a decision on Baigâ€™s resignation at the cabinet meeting scheduled on Wednesday. Neither Krishna nor Baig were available for comments.

It is learnt that Baig had given his resignation letter to the CM before the latter went abroad for a holiday on December 29.

The BJPâ€™s demand for Baigâ€™s resignation gained momentum after Telgiâ€™s advocate Abdul Rehman met Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani on December 19 and named Baig and former Maharashtra deputy chief minister Chhagan Bhujbal as â€˜â€˜major beneficiariesâ€™â€™ of the scam.

The situation worsened when his brother Rehan surrendered to the Stamp Investigation Team (StampIT) on December 21.

Although no evidence has been traced to Baigâ€™s involvement in the scam, the minister has been under a cloud.

10,Rana calls urgent meet of party MPs,"GANDHINAGAR: In view of the possibility of early Lok Sabha elections, the state BJP president Rajendrasinh Rana has called the party MPs for an urgent meeting on Monday evening.

The meeting will discuss the various works pending with the government, take stock of the political situation and analyse the various Lok Sabha constituencies in the state. Criticism of the Modi government by former chief minister Keshubhai Patel for inept handling of the farmers issues may echo in the meeting where the Chief Minister Narendra Modi would be present.

Some of the MPs may express displeasure over the stern government action against Bharatiya Kisan Sanghâ€” the farmersâ€™ body which has been demanding complete roll-back of hike in power tariff. In fact, a senior MP told TNN that the government should try for an amicable settlement with the agitating farmers â€˜before it was too lateâ€™.

The state has more than once refused a total rollback in the power tariff saying that it cannot offer more than the already offered 50 per cent relief. State finance minister Vajubhai Vala had recently asked Keshubhai Patel to persuade the BKS leaders, who he said were politicising the issue after failure to secure enough support with the farmers.

Both Modi and the outgoing state BJP chief Rana will brief the MPs on the various developmental works along with major ones like Narmada and execution of the joint ventures approved during Vibrant Gujarat Global Investors meet held last year. Union rural development minister Kashiram Rana, minister of state for Home Harin Pathak, and two other union ministers Dr Vllabhbhai Kathiria and Bhavnaben Chikhaliya are also expected to attend the important meeting.

Meanwhile, the MPs, who feel that declaration the general elections may stall the ongoing development work in their respective constituencies, said they will urge the government to move faster. A sum of Rs two crore per annum is sanctioned to each MP for the development in his constituency.

The Rajya Sabha member can spend the amount anywhere in the state while the Lok Sabha member must spend it in his own constituency. MPs are also likely to make suggestions benefitting them politically in the general election. The BJP has 21 members in Lok Sabha and eight Rajya Sabha members from the state.

11,MSU moots campus development plan,"VADODARA: Aimed at a major facelift, M S University here has embarked upon a campus development plan,which includes streamlining parking space, garbage disposal, canteens and roads on the campus.

The university will take up in phases proposals put up by a committee, which submitted its report to the vice chancellor K C Upadhyay recently. One of the major issues raised by the report was that of poor maintenance of various buildings. This included the teachersâ€™ residences w h i c h were in a very bad shape and n e e d e d m a i n t e -n a n c e , said officials in their report.

Whitewashing of many buildings had not been taken up for years and is likely to be taken up on a priority basis.. Commenting on the report, Upadhyay said that it had raised several issues like poor garbagedisposal and parking facilities. â€œThe parking is haphazard while the university does not have a garbage-disposal system at all. The campus has no dustbins and littering is rampant.

This will be taken care of in the new plan,â€� Upadhyay said. The plan, which had even suggested aesthetically-perfect designs for dustbins, had also proposed for new entry and exit points for the university, said Upadhyay. â€œBesides, there are suggestions to close some existing gates of the campus. One of the main entrance being planned is from the Kamatibag main road near the Jaybag,â€� Upadhyay said. Apart from suggesting the collection of nominal amounts from the students and teachers for parking, the report had recommended new parking lots at various points on the campus. This arrangement would take care of slipshod vehicle parking on the campus and the problem of vehicle thefts, said sources.

U p a d -hyay said that the p r o j e c t had also suggested some welldeveloped canteens across the campus. â€œPresently, we have several small canteens and probably every university building seeks a canteen for itself. Instead, the plan suggests good canteens at select places on the campus,â€� Upadhyay said. Meanwhile, the roads inside the campus are likely to take a turn for the better rather soon. A budget of Rs 90 lakh has been earmarked for the same and the Vadodara Municipal Corporation identified as the agency to carry out the work.
