0,"It's about politics, say OU students","HYDERABAD: Trouble on the Osmania University campus that broke out following a simple incident on Tuesday may lead to the university authorities cracking down on non-boarders living in the campus hostels.

Though a version doing the rounds was that the clashes between ABVP and TRS Vidhyarthi Vibhag members were a result of an ABVP movement to get non-boarders vacate the hostels, TRSVV members said the clashes took place as the ABVP camp was miffed as a good number of students were joining the TRS youth wing.

At least five persons were injured, two seriously, as the two groups of students attacked each other. The injured were identified as Mohammed Fakuruddin, MA second year student and E Anjaneeyulu Goud, LLB first year student.

In a retaliatory attack, TRSVV members raided the rooms of ABVP activists and destroyed their belongings. A group of students said the tiff was a result of rivalry between the two youth wings affiliated to political parties, and had nothing to do with the campaign launched by ABVP activists demanding the university officials to vacate non-borders from hostels.

Fakuriddin, who was seriously injured, urged the government to take stern action against the ABVP activists. ""The ABVP activists have been waiting for an opportunity to take revenge against the students who recently joined the TRS. This took the form of an attack on Tuesday.""

1,Governance to be election plank: Advani,"NEW DELHI: Governance, rather than political issues, will be the focus of the BJP''s electoral campaign both for the forthcoming assembly elections and next yearâ€™s Lok Sabha polls, deputy PM L K Advani said here.

â€˜â€˜The message is simple: Those who have provided good governance should be elected and those who have failed should be voted out,â€™â€™ he said at a post-Diwali lunch at Delhi BJP president Madan Lal Khuranaâ€™s residence.

The â€˜â€˜turning pointâ€™â€™, he said, came in 1997 when, on the occasion of the Golden Jubilee celebrations of Independence, he had undertaken a rath yatra and said that even after 50 years, the dreams of the â€˜â€˜deshbhaktsâ€™â€™ who had won freedom for India had not been realised as the Congress governments had failed to convert swaraj into su-raj. The BJP, he said, promised to do just that.

This, he said, was now bearing fruit: â€˜â€˜Since we donâ€™t focus on political issues, our opponents are also not raising such issues.â€™â€™.

He recalled that the Congress had attempted to raise the question of Gujarat during the assembly elections in Goa earlier this year to frighten the minorities, but Goa chief minister Manohar Parrikar had made an appeal on the basis of his own record of governance and the BJP had been voted back to power.

2,Liquor policy favours the chosen ones,"HYDERABAD: The last time the High Court made strong observations was about Ramasubba Reddy continuing to be a minister despite being accused in a double murder case. This time, it has passed stinging strictures against the government, the likes of which are unheard of in the annals of AP.

A Goa-based distillery filed a writ petition against the Chandrababu Naidu government for not allowing it to sell its liquor in AP despite its willingness to sell at prices lower than what the AP Breweries Corporation is presently paying.

The government has been refusing to entertain new entrants and at the same time renewing the licences of the existing producers and also allowing them to increase their capacities.

The court described the governmentâ€™s attitude as arbitrary, violative of Art. 14 of the Constitution, monopolistic, and vacuous. The judgment copy indicates that the state audaciously argued that it is fulfilling its purpose of curbing liquor, even while showing files that manufacturers were permitted to increase capacities by quantum leaps.

Three paragraphs of the judgment need reproduction: ""The conduct of the state is tantamount to conferring exclusive patronage on the existing distilleries without any redeeming public interest justification.

No discernable governmental interest is pleaded, urged or established for this conduct in creating a perpetual manufacturing and supply monopoly favouring the existing private distilleries.

4,Haryana starts insurance scheme for farmers,"CHANDIGARH: The Haryana government on Wednesday decided to introduce the National Agriculture Insurance Scheme (NAIS) in the state to provide insurance cover and financial support to farmers in the event of failure of crops due to natural calamities, pests and diseases.

A decision to this effect was taken by the state cabinet which met here under the chairmanship of chief minister Om Prakash Chautala.

The state government would have to contribute Rs 8 crore per year for both Kharif and Rabi crops as contribution towards the premium subsidy, bank service charges, publicity and training, corpus fund, claim of food crops and oilseed crops.

The premium liability of the farmers for the crops, which are likely to be covered under the scheme, would tentatively be Rs 254 per hectare for mustard, Rs 77 per hectare for bajra, Rs 76 per hectare for gram and Rs 160 per hectare for cotton.

The scheme, which is already being implemented in 21 states and two union territories, aims at encouraging farmers to adopt progressive farming practices, high-value inputs and latest technology in agriculture.

While all farmers, including sharecroppers and tenant farmers, would be covered under the scheme, it would be compulsory for the loanee farmers and voluntary for non-loanee farmers.

Fifty per cent subsidy in premium is allowed for small farmers, having up to five acres of land-holding, and marginal farmers having upto 2.5 acres of land-holding, and it would be shared equally by the state and central governments. The premium subsidy would be phased out in five years.

The cabinet also gave its ex-post facto approval to the amendment made in the Punjab Passenger and Goods Taxation Rules, 1952 and promulgated an ordinance to amend the Punjab Passenger and Goods Taxation Act, 1952. Overloaded vehicles will henceforth be penalised at tax collection points which are manned round-the-clock by taxation inspectors.

5,2 students beaten up in OU clash,"HYDERABAD: Campus violence, unheard of in the past decade or so, erupted in Osmania University on Tuesday night as two groups of students clashed. Two students were badly beaten up, prompting the police to post pickets at several spots in the campus.

Apparent simmering differences between the BJP-affiliated Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) and the TRS-backed Telangana Rashtra Samithi Vidyarthi Vibhag (TRSVV) came to the fore after Subash Chandra Bose, an ABVP activist, riding a scooter ran into TRS youth wing member Venkatesh in the campus on Tuesday night. An argument broke out between the two, leading to the two groups attacking each other.

Six students have been arrested. They have been identified as Subash Chandra Bose (25), a LLB first year student, Mohan Rao (25), a PhD student, P Narender Reddy (22), V Venkanna (23), P Raju (23) and B Raja Gopal (25), all MA first year students.

The university authorities are considering the suspension of 14 students who were involved in the incident. The police said the situation in the campus was well under control.

6,"Move to unify Dal factions on, says former minister","BELLARY: Former minister M.P. Prakash on Wednesday expressed hope that the Janata Parivar factions would unite and that attempts in this direction were still on.

Speaking to reporters here, he said the efforts towards unification would be revived on November 12, when all the senior leaders of both factions and elected representatives will meet in Hospet, near here.

Prakash said the candidates for legislative council, who should be elected through local body institutions, will be selected on November 5.

As the term of the 25 MLCs has come to an end, elections will be held on December 1.

In this background, if both factions agree, a common Janata Parivar candidate will be fielded, he said, adding that the search was on for a suitable candidate, which will be declared at a meeting in Bangalore on November 5.

Ridiculing former minister Nage Gowdaâ€™s remarks that only three legislators were with Prakash, he said: â€œHow many legislators are with me will be known on November 12; let him wait till then.â€™â€™

He said a rally will be organised in Hospet on November 12.

On that day, efforts would be initiated towards unification of the factions.

Prakash strongly criticised the manner in which the Hampi Utsav was being held saying the government was succumbing to pressure from sponsors.

He said the government had failed to lay good roads at least on the occasion of the festival and failed to press the railway department, which did not complete most of the projects.

7,'Create awareness on govt schemes',"SHIMOGA: S. Bangarappa, MP, has urged Shimoga district and taluk officials to help create an awareness among villagers on the importance of various poverty alleviation schemes sponsored by the Centre.

While reviewing progress of schemes at the zilla panchayat in the presence of newly-nominated members, he urged the officials to provide all facilities to people, specially women and the weaker sections of society.

He lauded the progress made by womenâ€™s self-help groups in the district and urged the zilla panchayat CEO to prevail upon the banks in the district to help these groups take up income-generating activities.

He also urged them to educate people on the need to utilise the schemes effectively.

Shimoga District Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the action committee to protect the interests of tax payers, have urged citizens not to stop paying taxes till the government came out with a proper tax revision structure. The committee has decided to intensify the agitation if the government does not meet these demands.

Vasanth Kumar and T.V. Narayana Shastry said the chamber has presented a report of the analysis of the â€œunscientificâ€™â€™ proposed tax to the authorities but it has â€œnot bothered to look into itâ€™â€™.

According to their report, the SAS rates of Shimoga municipal authorities was higher than those in other cities across the state.

Kuvempu study centre: Rashtrakavi Kuvempu Prathishtana, Kuppalli and Kannada University, Hampi have jointly opened the Kuvempu study centre at Kuppalli, the birthplace of the renowned poet.

Health minister Kagodu Thimmappa, who inaugurated the centre, hailed Kuvempu as one of the greatest humanists of the 20th century who propagated the â€˜Viswa Manava Sandeshaâ€™ to instill values of universal brotherhood and peace.

H.G. Lakkappa Gowda, the vice-chancellor of Kannada University, called upon the people to propagate the essence of works of the great poet.

Kuvempuâ€™s birth centenary will be celebrated during December by holding seminars and workshops in coordination with the state government.

8,'More MLCs should be ministers',"BANGALORE: The Institute of Parliamentary Affairs has urged the government to give adequate representation to MLCs in the council of ministers.

Institute secretary M.C. Shanthamurthy submitted a study report on â€œRole of Karnataka MLCs in the governmentâ€™â€™ to Legislative Council chairman B.L. Shankar on Wednesday.

He said representation given to the Council is just 12 per cent of its total strength, as against 25 per cent in the Assembly.

â€œThere are only six ministers from the Council as against 43 from the Assembly. Not only representation given to Council is inadequate, only one of the MLCs has been made Cabinet minister,â€™â€™ he pointed out.

Further, ministers from the Council â€” H.K. Patil, Rani Satish, B.K. Chandrashekar and Basavaraj Patil Humnabad â€” have been appointed for strong practical and political reasons. â€œSimilarly, T. John and Nafees Fazal have been made ministers as they belong to minorities,â€™â€™ he added.

9,AIPJD to hold protest march on Nov 11,"BANGALORE: The AIPJD will organise a â€˜Vidhana Soudha chaloâ€™ on November 11 in protest against the governmentâ€™s decision to form the Tirumala Tirupati trust in violation of the agreement signed by the erstwhile Mysore Maharaja.

After a district-level AIPJD meeting on Wednesday, state unit president K.N. Nage Gowda said the 22-acre property of the Wadiyars, hitherto with the religious endowments department, had been transferred to trust headed by chief minister S.M. Krishna.

â€œTo name Krishna and urban development minister D.K. Shivakumar as permanent trustees is against the original agreement. The government has no power to form a trust,â€™â€™ he declared.

Speaking to The Times of India over telephone from Bellary, Shivakumar said Krishna is the chief patron of the trust only by designation, while he has been a trustee for three years. If a new government comes next year, they can either retain me or appoint someone else,â€™â€™ he added.

Shivakumar said neither the CM nor he had any personal interest in the project. â€œOur objective is to serve God and people. My endeavour is to see the project comes to a shape while Gowda is doing his duty as opposition leader,â€™â€™ he maintained.

12,Gulf carriers skeptical about open sky policy,"MUMBAI: Gulf carriers are skeptical about the open sky policy announced by the Centre since it is linked to existing commercial agreements with A-I and IA.

Foreign airline officials felt that carriers may not have the freedom to mount additional flights to India because of this link to the agreements with AI and IA.

""Both these airlines may not agree to some of our proposals for operating extra flights. For the moment, we are adopting a wait and watch attitude,"" said an official.

The order envisages allowing foreign carriers from December to February â€” a peak season â€” to deploy additional capacity by way of larger aircraft or operate more flights.

The decision comes in the wake of the PMâ€™s announcement of such a policy for the Asean nations.

13,AASU to float new political party,"GUWAHATI: The All Assam Students'' Union (AASU) has said that it is planning to float a new political party as the people are looking for an alternative to the Asom Gana Parishad (AGP).

Branding the AGP as a ''betrayer'', AASU president Prabin Boro said in a statement here on Wednesday night that it would soon initiate discussions with several organisations and prominent individuals to find an ""alternative to the present set of politicians who have failed to protect the rights of the indigenous people"".

Boro pointed out that the AGP was formed at the initiative of the AASU and the people of Assam to work for the interest of the indigenous people and to implement all the clauses of the Assam Accord. But the party had failed to live up to the expectations of the people, he said.

He said that the AASU would not spare anyone found to be working against Assam and its people''s interests.

The AASU would soon initiate talks with the cross-section of people, including those representing ethnic groups, and take a decision as per their suggestions for the protection of the interests of the indigenous people, he said.

""If these organisations and individuals want us to take up political responsibility to safeguard the interest of our people, we have to take up that role,"" Boro added.

14,Operators say new plan flawed,"NEW DELHI: With just hours to go before the crucial meeting of Group of Ministers on telecom, cellular operators on Thursday shot off another letter to Finance Minister Jaswant Singh saying that TRAI''s proposed Unified Licences would give away superior 3G licences to WLL operators as a gift worth Rs 30,000 crore.

""It is glaring that the TRAI has omitted to mention that through such a Unified Licence, the fixed operators would have been in effect gifted a free 3G (third-generation) licence which internationally have been auctioned for significant moneys,"" Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) has said in the letter.

""In a summary analysis of the value of 3G licence undertaken by COAI in 2002, the average value of a 3G licence is over Rs 30,000 crore,"" COAI said.

COAI claimed that the move would also ironically have the effect of gifting the fixed operators more advanced and superior mobile services than the legitimate cellular licences.

Simply put, 3G means the next generation of mobile services which includes automatic roaming, and much high capability for data and video conferencing.

15,Mahanta involved in secret killings: Assam govt,"GUWAHATI: The Assam government on Thursday accused former chief minister Prafulla Kumar Mahanta of being involved in ""secret killings"" that rocked the state during the rule of the previous AGP government.

Government spokesman Ripun Bora said in a release here that the former chief minister''s statement at the AGP executive meeting on Tuesday that the ""secret killings"" took place at the direction of the Centre was proof of Mahanta''s involvement in the dastardly acts.

""The former chief minister had surrendered himself shamelessly to the Centre for safeguarding his petty political interests as is evident from his confessions,"" he said.

Bora said that Mahanta''s statement clearly indicated that neither the Centre nor the BJP were bothered about solving the vexed insurgency problem in the state.

The so-called ""secret killings"" had rocked the state during the last few years of the previous AGP government''s rule when family members of several top ULFA leaders were killed by surrendered ULFA militants with the alleged support of the then state government.
