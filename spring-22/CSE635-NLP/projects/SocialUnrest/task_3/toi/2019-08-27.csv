1,Police arrest Nisar Bapu as court rejects surrender plea,"VADODARA: The city police on Monday arrested municipal councillor and former deputy mayor Nisarhussain Abrarhussain Saiyed alias Nisar Bapu in connection with a murder during communal violence in the city. Saiyed, absconding since over four months, was taken into police custody after a local court turned down a surrender application moved by him.

Saiyed had moved the surrender application pleading that he should be taken into judicial custody. Saiyed pleaded in the application that his political rivals had wrongly implicated him in the case.

Saiyed''s counsel Jagdish Ramani also stated that political parties opposing Saiyed and the police had threatened to kill him in an ""encounter"". The application also states that the charges of his involvement in the conspiracy for murder were wrong.

The accused had also expressed fear that he may be physically harassed by the investigating officers. It also pleaded that Saiyed''s counsel be allowed to remain present during questioning.

Saiyed was wanted for a murder in the Fatehpura area of the city during the communal riots in March. On the day of the offence, the city police had nabbed his son, Abidhussain, and three others in the matter.

The public prosecutor and investigating officer, however, argued that the offence registered against Saiyed was of a serious nature. They pleaded that investigations in the case could progress further only if the accused was handed over in police custody.

The court observed that the behaviour of the accused in the past suggested that it was not proper to allow him to surrender to the court. The order also observed that if the accused was handed over the judicial custody, there would be technical problems in handing him over to police custody later. It further stated that the police could take custody of Saiyed after giving a report to the court.

In connection with the fear of encounter and torture expressed by the accused, the court ordered that the police should follow all directives laid down by the Supreme Court in the D K Basu v/s State of West Bengal case. Police inspector N K Rathod of the economic offence cell of the city police took custody of the accused following the order.

2,Kamat dares NCP to pull out of govt,"MUMBAI: Vice-president of the Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee (MPCC) Gurudas Kamat has challenged the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) to pull out of the Democratic Front (DF) coalition government in Maharashtra. He was responding to the tirade launched against Congress president Sonia Gandhi by senior NCP leader P.A. Sangma here recently. Sangma had said that he planned to shortly publish a book which would focus attention on the danger to the nation if Gandhi, a person of foreign origin, became the Prime Minister. Kamat said Sangma assailed Gandhi but he was not averse to his party sharing power with the Congress in Maharashtra. This clearly showed that his opposition to Gandhi was not based on any principle. â€œI challenge him to ask his party to withdraw from the government,â€™â€™ Kamat said. Kamat said a person of Sangmaâ€™s stature was least qualified to attack Gandhi, specially since the courts have unambiguously upheld the validity of her Indian citizenship. In a separate statement, the MPCC said Sangma was pursuing a politically suicidal course. It warned Sangma that Congressmen from Maharashtra would never tolerate any attack on Gandhi. Meanwhile, there is speculation about MPCC president Govindrao Adik being replaced by Sushilkumar Shinde, former state minister. However, it is learnt that Shinde, who unsuccessfully contested the post of vicepresident of India recently, was not keen on becoming MPCC president. He is more inclined to become the CM. But the NCP and a vast section of the Congress are keen on Vilasrao Deshmukh continuing as the chief minister. It is stated that for the past more than two years, Deshmukh had successfully handled the DF coalition and defeated plans of the Shiv Sena-BJP alliance to pull down the government. It is learnt that Deshmukh plans an extensive tour of the state to ensure that the demands made by party MLAs are being implemented.

3,Bumpy ride for Congress if farmers lose free power,"JALANDHAR: The Congress government is headed for a bumpy drive if free power is withdrawn from the agriculture sector.

Rumblings have already been heard from farm organisations. The action will hurt farmers all the more as they have already borrowed money at high rates for buying generators, for boring deeper to reach the water table and for diesel to irrigate the paddy crop.

Farmers with medium land holdings are expected to be hurt the most as they use power for a large number of implements. It is feared that violence could also erupt and public property could be torched by angry farmers.

Experts are predicting withdrawal symptoms.â€™ The jagirdars are already preparing to mobilise and influence small farmers to express their anger in the streets.

They are exploiting the situation as they gained the most from free power for their heavy equipment. A large number of farmers had shifted their household functions to tubewells in the last five years.

They had even installed air conditioners. There would be large-scale shifting from the tentative â€˜tubewell housesâ€™ back to the traditional lifestyle. But the Opposition flexing muscle to exploit this issue to the hilt. It is viewing this issue as a relief amidst anti-corruption drives. It is even hoping the issue would snowball leading to the Congress governmentâ€™s fall.

Already Bharatiya Kisan Union (Ekta) has sounded a warning and has announced that it would organise a protest in Chandigarh on August 29, and possibly beyond, on the issue of withdrawal of free electricity. â€˜â€˜We have told farmers to refuse payment of electricity bills,â€™â€™ said Gurmit Singh Dittupur, general secretary of BKU (Ekta) state unit.

A sharp vertical divide is feared in society due to the withdrawal of free power to the farm sector. The city dweller has heaved a sigh of relief as he feels that due to the loss of revenue the urban sector had to pay high rates for power.

Dhani Ram Gupta, press secretary of Punjab Beopar Mandal, said, â€˜â€˜In the first place, the idea of free power by Parkash Singh Badal was wrong. Even at that time, farmers were willing to pay for power if a regular supply was guaranteed. We welcome the decision to withdraw free power. As for the crisis in the farm sector, the trader is also going through a grave crisis.â€™â€™

Already, farmers of Mansa, Bathinda, Sangrur and Patiala belts had been hit hard by the drought conditions. Now farmers whose paddy had not been totally damaged will also come under the grey area and there would be a large chunk of disappointed farmers.

â€˜â€˜There could have been some imaginative ways of introducing power bills once again after having played populist political gimmicks in the earlier regime. Slabs could have been created so that a farmer possessing one tubewell is distinguished from the farmer having two or more than two,â€™â€™ said Major Singh of Lamha village when contacted by TNN.

4,HR panel probes police detention of govt official,"ALIGARH: The Human Rights Commission has decided to probe into the detention in police custody of M S Yadav, district inspector of schools, on the basis of a complaint filed by him.

In the complaint, Yadav has charged the district magistrate of â€˜â€˜humiliatingâ€™â€™ him in public by ordering his arrest during a review meeting of district officials. The commission is expected to submit its report very shortly.

Following an education department staff stir over the issue, district magistrate of Aligarh Deepak Kumar was suddenly transferred last week.

But the â€˜â€˜mere transferâ€™â€™ has not been â€˜â€˜satisfactoryâ€™â€™ for the UP staff association of the education department. They have pointed out that there wasâ€˜â€˜no ground whatsoeverâ€™â€™ for using the police to humiliate the above official. Meanwhile, the controversy generated by the arrest of the education department official has succeeded in deflecting public attention from the issues which lead to Yadavâ€™s arrest.

For the past two, three years there have been major allegations regarding the funds totalling several crores of rupees released by the education department for distribution as scholarship for deprived sections and children belonging to Dalit families.

The transferred district magistrate had ordered a full probe into such allegations immediately after taking charge.

5,EC takes note of Kanshi's use of govt aircraft,"LUCKNOW: The Election Commission has taken note of the BSP supremo Kanshi Ram and UP forest minister Jaiveer Singh making a visit to Jammu and Kashmir on a UP government aircraft on August 23.

A senior EC official told TNN over phone from New Delhi that â€œthe commission is seized of the matter and is collecting information to check whether the trip is violative of the ECâ€™s code of conduct.â€� On his part, the forest minister Jaiveer Singh first denied having accompanied the BSP supremo to Jammu and Kashmir on the state aircraft King Air C-90B UP-2 on August 23 and then also saw nothing wrong in the trip.

â€œMedia mere baare mein kya kya chhapta rahta hai (I donâ€™t what all the media keeps on writing against me),â€� fumed Singh while taking umbrage at the media reports about his visit to Jammu.

Although the BSP leader Kanshi Ram was quoted in the reports as saying that he travelled in the aircraft with Jaiveer, the minister said, â€œI did not make any trip to Jammu and Kashmir using the state aircarft. Anyway, I would check with my staff about how my name had been dragged,â€� he added.

While denying media reports, Singh raised doubts on his own clarification. â€œEven if I had gone there with Kanshi Ramji, there was nothing wrong and illegal,â€� he stated while talking to mediapersons at the Central Hall on Monday. The BSP supremo was quoted as saying that he took a lift on the aircraft as Singh was coming to Jammu in connection with some official work.

According to reports, a state aircraft had landed at the Jammu airport on August 23 and flew back to Lucknow after dropping Kanshi Ram. The forest minister Jaiveer Singh was accompanying the BSP supremo. Reports claim that the forest minister was not on any official trip as he did not meet any state government official and the aircraft returned after refuelling and leaving Kanshi Ram.

When asked for his comments, chief secretary DS Bagga said that he doesnâ€™t know anything about it. â€œI do not deal with civil aviation departmentâ€�, he said.

7,NDA govt will solve J&K problem: Advani,"BANGALORE: Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani on Tuesday asserted that the government was determined to solve the Jammu and Kashmir problem in a ""very effective manner"" as much as it was determined to defeat the ""proxy war"" being waged by Pakistan.

Speaking after inaugurating the BJP''s southern zonal conference here, he said, ""We will see that Pakistan is defeated in the proxy war, which it has been waging for two decades"".

Advani said India had wrought a humiliating defeat of Pakistan in all wars in 1947, 1965 and 1971.

Virtually blaming the Congress for the Jammu and Kashmir strife, he said, ""We have inherited something from you (Congress)"".

The problem of Jammu and Kashmir was the story of missed opportunities. Had not the Congress missed those, the country would not have faced the problem, Advani said.

Turning to the Gujarat riots, Advani said during the regime of the BJP-led NDA in the last four and half years, there were no riots barring in Gujarat and the government was also distressed on this.

8,Cong to go it alone in J&K polls,"NEW DELHI: The Congress is not going for an alliance with any party in the forthcoming Assembly elections in Jammu and Kashmir and feels that the ruling National Conference is in for a big shock if the polls are held under governor''s rule.

The party, however, describes the People Democratic Party (PDP) led by former Union Minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed which has pockets of influence in the valley as a friendly party.

AICC Secretary Satyajit Gaekwad said that the BJP is going to come a cropper despite tying with the RSS-sponsored Jammu State Morcha which is advocating trifurcation of Jammu and Kashmir.

Stating that the BJP-JSM alliance was only to confuse the people, he said Congress is upbeat about its prospects in the Jammu region as the people there do not want to be alienated from Kashmir but are demanding equitable development.

He said Farooq Abdullah''s National Conference was a ""failed"" party and its attempts to project a ""fresh face"" in Union Minister Omar Abdullah would not cut much ice with the electorate.

He said denial of tickets to as many as 10 ministers by the NC showed his rule as ""corrupt and inefficient"".

Alleging that the NC has been winning polls due to rigging, he said only governor''s rule would ensure free and fair elections in the state.

Ga was also critical of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee for not ensuring free and fair elections in the sensitive state, a promise he made to the nation on the Independence Day last year.

9,Advani slams Opposition for anti-govt remarks,"BANGALORE: Launching an offensive against Opposition parties, Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani on Tuesday charged them with making ""slanderous attacks"" against BJP leaders and ministers having lost hope of dislodging the NDA government and with an eye on the next polls.

""Malign, abuse and accuse them left right and centre. The mud will stick. This is their plan and simple strategy"", Advani said, hitting out at opponents, particularly the Congress, who, he said, were making false allegations so that in the 2004 elections, ""this mud is still there somewhat"".

Advani told the delegates attending the two-day South Zonal conference of the party here that the adversaries were now certain that they would not be able to dislodge the NDA Government and that it would last till 2004.

Stating that a ""vicious campaign"" was being carried out against BJP, not because ""our party is bad"", but because it was surmounting all obstacles that came in its way. The government led by it would complete its full term, he added.

Advani said the Opposition had hoped to divide NDA, but did not succeed. They had now come to the conclusion that ""there is no hope of dislodging (the Vajpayee government) before the next polls"".

""Pick one leader and one minister and a slanderous attack should be made. Something will stick"" and if Parliament could be disrupted in support of this, it would make headlines was the strategy being adopted by the Opposition, he said.

12,Sonia slams govt on poll reforms ordinance,"NEW DELHI: In an unprecedented move, Congress president and Opposition leader Sonia Gandhi, in a signed press statement on Tuesday, strongly opposed the governmentâ€™s ordinance on electoral reforms.

She wrote: ""We condemn the central governmentâ€™s move to willfully pass an ordinance that defies (1) the will of a vast majority of the people, (2) the letter and spirit of the order of the Supreme Court and (3) the basic tenet of transparency and accountability in politics.""

According to the leader of the Opposition, the Congress is fully in concurrence with the orders of the Supreme Court that candidates must disclose information regarding convictions and charges for offences, assets and bank balances, and liabilities and overdues. ""The Congress party believes that such information must be disclosed by all candidates at the time of filing nomination and prior to an election,"" wrote Sonia.

She has even attacked the media for clubbing the Congress along with other parties that have opposed the implementation of the SC orders. She reiterated that the party is opposed only to the Election Commissionâ€™s directions vesting returning officers (RO) with the powers to investigate the authenticity of the information given and to reject the nomination papers on grounds of incomplete or false information.

13,Vaghela may spoil Modi's party at Phagvel,"NADIAD: The launch of Chief Minister Narendra Modi''s Gaurav Yatra from Phagvel village on Tuesday is likely to become a stormy affair with Kshatriyas of the district deciding to felicitate Shankersinh Vaghela on his appointment as the Gujarat Congress chief on the same day. What''s more, Vaghela is scheduled to hoist a flag at Bhathiji temple after a night-long kirtan on Monday.

Kshatriya leaders claim Vaghela''s programme was chalked out much before Modi decided to launch his Gaurav Yatra from Phagvel. Residents of the village, that has a population of nearly 15,000 Kshatriyas, have expressed apprehension about the yatra, considering both supporters of Modi and Vaghela would be trooping in. While Vaghela''s supporters expect nearly 40,000 people to attend the temple programme, the BJP''s yatra is bound to draw its workers from all over the state.

Sarpanch Dahyabhai Parmar conveyed his concern to urban development minister I K Jadeja and minister of state for labour Sundersinh Chauhan on Wednesday when the two arrived to supervise arrangements for the yatra. He urged them to ""give up this programme"". A memorandum was submitted to the collector.

A former MLA from Dakor, Ramsinh Parmar, told TNN that leaders of Phagvel had already expressed the fear that the yatra could lead to violence and, therefore, should be abandoned.

Modi has chosen to launch his yatra from Phagvel, a Kshatriya-dominated area that happens to be in Vaghela''s parliamentary constituency. Another reason for choosing the village as the launchpad is that the legendary Bhathiji Maharaj had given up his life some 150 years ago to save cows from being slaughtered by Muslims.

15,"Six months on, riot wounds refuse to heal","VADODARA: For Asfaque, Imtiaz, Natu and Saraswati, time has not proved to be a healer. Six months after riots gripped the state, ravaging in its wake the Sanskarnagari of Vadodara too, their wounds seem to be too deep for any balm to heal.

If Asfaque and Imtiaz still shudder when they recall the day a murderous mob killed their father in front of their eyes, 14-year-old Tulsidas'' mother cannot forget the night when her son''s body was brought home, killed by a police bullet.

Tears still well up her eyes as Tulsidas'' mother looks at his portrait. ""He was an innocent bystander at Shivaji Chowk when the police opened fire on March 1. There were others from our family there. But he was the one who got hit,"" she says. ""He was the only son, a hardworking boy, helping his sisters with the household work, fetching water and also attending school,"" she adds. The compensation of Rs 90,000 now means nothing to her.

Fourteen-year-old Natu''s world came crumbling down on March 1 when his father Arvind Vasava decided to visit his aunt Saraswati in Sanjay Nagar in Tuksiwadi. Arvind Vasava''s sister had fled their home and he got stabbed. ""My brother died in our house. We had escaped to a nearby school to save ourselves from rioters. We got to know of his death only after we saw his photographs at the police station. Natu, who lost his mother long ago, is now an orphan and stays with us,"" says Saraswati.

For Asfaque and Imtiaz, who lost their father Munnekhan Pathan, lynched to death by a mob in Avdhutnagar in presence of police personnel, the ordeal continues.

Pathan was a prosperous businessman in Makarpura GIDC and owned five plots. Today his wife and two sons live like paupers. ""Our house in Avdhutnagar had 16 rooms. Now we are living in a one-room rented house,"" says Asfaque.

We have not been paid compensation for damage to our property, and all the 88 persons arrested by police in connection my father''s murder have been released, despite scores of eye-witness accounts. The main culprits are still at large,"" he adds.

The family cannot dare to return as they still receive threats. ""Our houses were looted, vehicles set on fire. Even door-knobs have been taken away from our house,"" Asfaque said. A sum of Rs 90,000, which the family got as compensation for Pathan''s death, is ""their only means of survival now.""

Mehndi Sheikh, one of city''s respected cricket coaches, now seldom passes through Salatwada. His house there was looted and set on fire on February 28. But what Sheikh, who represented Baroda in Ranji Trophy for 13 years, still cannot forget is that the mob destroyed all his medals and certificates he had won since 1961. For a man who has a passion for the game, with all his three daughters playing cricket, the trauma lingers even six months after that ""terrible night"".

A hapless Sheikh now lives a two-room rented flat in Macchipith and has received a paltry compensation of Rs 7000 from the government.
