3,Irate farmers lay siege to Kurnool collectorate,"kurnool: thousands of farm-ers led by byreddy seshasayana reddy, former minister and father of tdp mla b rajasekhar reddy of nandikotkuru, laid siege to the kurnool district collectorate com-plex here on monday demanding the authorities to release water into the kurnool-cuddapah (kc) canal. farmers from nandikotku-ru, atmakuru and kurnool con-stituencies participated in the protest. the farmers took out a rally from the stb college to the kurnool district collectorate in protest against district collector g sai prasad's decision asking farmers to give up the crop season as there was no water in the tungabhadra river. they staged a rasta roko at the rajvihar centre and also in front of the hospital main gate. it may be recalled that due to scanty rainfall, the authorities have not released water into the kc canal, which was to supply water for about 1.75 lakh acre ayacut in kurnool and cuddapah districts. the entire ayacut remained fallow due to the decision of the authori-ties. later, addressing the gathering at the collectorate, seshashayana reddy warned the officials that the farmers would intensify their agitation if water was not released to the canal. he alleged that the ministers, mlas and officials were indiffer-ent to the farmers' problems and did not take any measures to help them. reddy criticised telugu de-sam ministers b v mohan reddy, k e prabhakar and n m d farooq for their nonchalant attitude over the kc canal problem. he said the ministers did not even inquire about the problem of the farmers. if the ministers take up the issue with the chief minister, water can be released to the canal, he said. though the allotted quota of wa-ter for the kc canal was available at the tungabhadra dam, officials were refusing to release it, he alleged. he charged the authorities of having taken an anti-farmer stand. he demanded the government to help the farmers under the kc canal ayacut by releasing water immediately. as per the bachawat tribunal award, 10 tmc sq ft of water is allocated to the kc canal in the dam. meanwhile, farmers of nandyal, allagadd a and chagalamarry in kurnool and mydukur and cudda-pah areas of cuddapah district are also planning to organise a similar agitation. but the superintendent engineer said the available water if released for agriculture would not be sufficient even for a week to the ayacut. he said in view of the serious drinking water problem in the villages, it was decided not to re-lease water for the crops.

7,Three arrested in Kanpur bank scam,"kanpur: the cooperative cell (kanpur division) on monday arrested three officials sushumlata saxena, naveen chand saxena and d k raizada of the federal cooperative bank for financial bungling of rs 9 crore in gujani area here. they were sent to jail. sources claimed that several senior officers of the cooperative cell and even ministers were involved in the scam. two boxes full of currency were recovered from the possession of these officials though the authorities refused to confirm it. deputy sp (cooperative cell) nandlal singh told times news network that the three officials were involved in the scam (rs 2.67 crore-worth embezzlement and other financial irregularities worth rs 6.5 crore). ramesh chandra saxena, sushumlata's husband, was arrested in the same case two months ago. singh said r c saxena had opened a branch of federal cooperative bank in ghatampur in 1995 with rbi permission. later, he opened five more branches in naubasta, motijheel, karachikhana and awas vikas without rbi permission. he, with the help of some officials of these branches, collected huge amounts of money and also maintained the records of fake loans. the cooperative cell had registered cases against 28 officials of the federal bank.

8,CDMA vs GSM: The first clash of technologies,"mumbai: doesn't matter whether you are a bpl mobile or an orange subscriber, chances are that your service has been disrupted lately. subscribers from hyderabad, ahmedabad, kochi and pune are all in the same boat, thanks to the testing of new systems by two state-owned firms - mahanagar telephone nigam ltd (mtnl) and bharat sanchar nigam ltd (bsnl). both the state-owned companies, mtnl and bsnl, are trying out experiments with their last mile connectivity using wireless in local loop (will) application based on cdma technology for their basic services. the last mile connectivity, thus, uses airwaves and establishes a connection of a fixed but wireless phone line to the exchange. while the initiatives taken by mtnl and bsnl will usher in wireless communication in basic services, what is being debated today is whether the tests through will is a breach of contractual obligations of the government. this is because the spots allotted to mtnl's cdma platform in the 880-890 mhz frequency band interferes with those allotted to cellular mobile service providers (cmsps). who is to be blamed for the current disruptions in frequency waves that cause mobile phones go off the air, sometimes for hours together? the cmsps or mtnl and bsnl combined? the application being tried by mtnl and bsnl is without adequate preventive measures to stop inter-operator interference of frequency waves, say cellular operators. according to cmsps, mtnl in mumbai have not installed proper filters on their cdma transmitters to prevent radio waves from entering into their allocated frequency bandwidth of 890-915 megahertz, which uplinks gsm mobile users to the base stations. however, mtnl's chief general manager, s. ramni iyer, refuted the allegations and said filters were being installed which would take another three months to complete the installations in mumbai circle. which may mean mobile users will continue to get interrupted services for some more time. the wireless planning and coordination (wpc) wing of the ministry of communication, has conducted four joint-tests with orange and mtnl since april this year - the month when disturbances started, say cmsps. the tests proved beyond doubt that the fault rests with mtnl. the wpc in its july 23 letter to mtnl had suggested mtnl to fulfil its obligation (of installing filters) within a month's timeframe so that it's signals degrade and not interfere with the adjoining frequency bandwidth. but despite the deadline having lapsed, mtnl is still going ahead with its testing. mr iyer says there's no deadline subscribed by wpc, secondly, mobile phones go dead largely because cmsps are using 'extended' gsm (egsm) bandwidth. cmsps are peeved with mtnl's high-handedness because mr iyer is of the opinion that filters must be installed not by them (mtnl) alone but also by cmsps because of their extensive gsm bandwidth. meaning they are using a frequency starting from below 890 megahertz in the 890-915 mhz band alloted to them. therefore, going by mr iyer's logic, cmsps' signals are interfering with the bandwidth allocated to mtnl and not the vice-versa. mtnl's allegations, however, does not hold water. if what mtnl claims was true than why did wpc suggest the use of filters to mtnl to prevent the spilling of electromagnetic waves into another's domain? secondly, cmsps, if found operating in the band reserved for will, which is the 880-890 mhz, wouldn't wpc take strong objection to it? in india, the concept of egsm (extended global system of mobile communication) does not exist as the government has allotted the 880-990 mhz band for all will service providers that include, mtnl, bsnl other existing private players like huges telecom and also future private players. even though cmsps' equipments are egsm complied, they just don't have the spectrum to prove mtnl's allegations. the nightmares for cmsps began way back early this year when the two state-owned companies started their will test runs for the last mile connectivity. orange and mtnl in mumbai together conducted several experiments since april this year that eventually proved the fault was with mtnl. delhi had similar problems. but filters solved the problem.

9,"SCs, STs seek more govt jobs, take out rally","bangalore: thousands of scheduled castes and scheduled tribes members from various parts of the state took out an impressive rally on monday demanding government jobs for their community in proportion to their population. the rally, jointly organised by the karnataka state dalit sangharsha samiti and dalit students' federation, also demanded bringing more jobs under the direct recruitment category rather than promotions, so as to provide a comprehensive social justice in a meaningful way. jnanpith awardee u r ananthamurthy demanded extension of reservation of posts in the private sector also to ensure all-round development of society. the role of the government is becoming minimal following indiscriminate privatisation. the worst-hit are the scs\sts. ""a strong movement is the need of the hour to demand reservations in the private sector also,"" he stated. arguing that the progress of the nation is directly linked to the progress of the large section of sc/sts, ananthamurthy called upon the people to give top priority to children's education. ""education leads to equality which is the bed-rock of any civilised society,"" he added. he, however, urged the sc/sts to shed hatred towards the poor belonging to the upper caste and develop compassion. ""perhaps the coming together of the have-nots of all the communities would bring a qualitative change in the society,"" he added. human right activist and former chairman of the backward classes commission ravivarma kumar said even in a progressive country like us, there is minority business enterprise clause where 17 per cent of the public works contract is given to the blacks. he demanded bringing more posts including that of the chief secretary under direct recruitment category. the reservation quota must be increased from the present 18 to 25 per cent with 18 per cent to scs and 7 per cent to sts. the rally urged the government to redraw the promotion list of engineers in the pw and water resources departments to set right the discrimination against sc/st engineers. a book titled ""judiciary and social justice"" was released by devanur mahadev on the occasion.

10,Cong pins hopes on Faridabad rally,"chandigarh: after bhiwani and panipat rallies, now it is faridabad rally, scheduled to be held on september 9, that will provide the haryana congress an opportunity to determine whether or not it is in a position to put up a united front against the onslaught of the ruling indian national lok dal (inld). though state congress leaders make tall claims of unity among their senior leaders, it is an open secret that while bhiwani rally was a show of strength of leader of the congress legislature party (clp) and former chief minister bhajan lal, at panipat it was hpcc president bhupinder singh hooda's show where bhajan lal was conspicuous by his absence. hooda did attend bhiwani rally, but the treatment meted out to him there was a clear picture of the fight for supremacy within the party between the factions led by these leaders. this time, of course, the central leadership of the party is taking no chances and party president sonia gandhi is reported to have directed all the senior state leaders to attend the rally and to also contribute their might to its success. the congress rank and file, however, are sceptical and argue that as such there is no urgency for these rallies in view of the fact that elections in the state are quite far off, but it is through these rallies that the two factions wish the overshadow each other. at the same time, they appear to be confident of the success of the rally largely due to what they call ""disillusionment of all sections with the inld government in the state."" in contrast, the ruling inld appears to be indifferent towards the congress rallies for two basic reasons. first, there are no elections in the state in near future. second, congress leadership in the state has so far failed to cause any sort of cracks, such as defections, in the legislature wing of the inld. bhajan lal, of course, keeps reiterating his threat to dislodge the inld government from time to time. inld supremo and chief minister op chautala is, however, so confident of the stability of his government that instead of organising rallies within the state to counter congress onslaught, he is busy addressing rallies in western up where he has opened a new front against the leadership of union minister ajit singh.

14,Orissa govt takes action against three officials,"bhubaneswar: the orissa government has finally started initiating action against officials allegedly responsible for the embezzlement of funds meant for the economic development of tribals of kashipur block in rayagada district. the block has witnessed the deaths of at least 20 tribals allegedly due to starvation in the last few weeks. the action came after the government faced widespread criticism against its non-performance and failure to provide succour to the hungry and jobless people, forcing them to eat mango kernels and wild roots, ultimately leading to the deaths. the supreme court has also rapped the government on the issue. an official press release issued here said the government had chargesheeted a former rayagada collector and two former directors, who were in charge of the orissa tribal development project (otdp) implemented between 1988 and 1997, for which rs 59.13 crore was provided by the union government under an agreement with the international fund for agriculture development (ifad). the officials are: former district collector u.k. mishra and h.c. behera and gangadhar panda, both of whom held the post of director of the ifad project. official sources said that they had not yet been suspended. the then deputy administrator of the kbk (undivided districts of kalahandi, balangir, koraput), hrushikesh panda, in his report submitted on september 22, 1999, had given the names of 13 persons, including the then district collector, as being responsible for the mess in the project. though the state government maintained that it had chargesheeted the three officials on august 16 under the orders of chief minister naveen patnaik, speculation is rife here that the action was deliberately backdated ostensibly to avoid further public criticism. the government claimed that panda's report was followed by three other investigations a special audit, a probe by a squad headed by a superintending engineer to verify the quality of works and accounts and another probe by a team of senior officials, including the scheduled caste and scheduled tribe department secretary. but all these could cover only 17 of the 285 projects. the rest were being referred to the vigilance department for a comprehensive investigation, the press release said. it promised action against other officials involved in the scam. the government also asserted that funds meant for the tribals could not be allowed to be frittered away or misappropriated.

15,"Rajnath, BJP's mascot for UP polls","new delhi: with the assembly elections in uttar pradesh looming large, and the prospects for the bjp still not very bright, the party has decided to go in for a major dose of ""information management"". the party's spin doctors have decided that chief minister rajnath singh will be the party's mascot in the state ^ not the prime minister ^ and is to be projected as a young and dynamic ""man of action"" and a ""go-getter."" simultaneously, a seminar has been called of the state's district correspondents to give the media a better ""understanding"" of rajnath singh the man and his government's ""achievements."" the objective is to use the media to help get the party's message across to the people. for instance, a senior bjp leader pointed out that the success of the new reservation policy that the up government is putting into place, in which the obcs have been divided into three categories and the scs into two categories, apart from the economically backward among the upper castes being given another five per cent, will depend on two factors ^ how effectively it is disseminated to the categories it is intended to benefit, i.e. the lower end of the obcs and the lower end of the scs; and how many tickets the party is actually able to give these sections. another party sources said, it will be difficult to do and so it is the first that it will have to depend on. but with time running out, the bjp requires all the assistance it can get to help make the message the medium. while the district correspondents will be the cutting edge of the ""information"" campaign, bjp ^ and even rss ^ leaders have begun to talk of how rajnath singh has turned around the fortunes of the bjp totally in the months since he took over from ramprakash gupta. apart from the reservation policy, the other elements of singh's achievements are being projected as implementing the recommendations of the fifth pay commission in respect of hiking the salaries of the government schoolteachers and the sacking of former energy minister naresh aggarwal and blaming him for the state's power crisis. the party's ek raat, ek gaon programme, through which the party leaders have individually spent a night each in villages across the state, is also being hailed as having mobilised party workers and changed the ""psychology"" of the voter as it has created an image of ""a party that cares"". if the party was once saying that only a miracle would make it touch 100 in the now 403-seat assembly, now the chorus is: there will be a bjp-led government after the elections.

16,Draft policy lays stress on primary health care,"new delhi: an ambitious new health policy draft seeks to revive the primary health system even as it suggests levying user charges in government hospitals and supports the growth of privately-run super speciality hospitals for a selected clientele. laying down the areas for increased outlay for the future, the government has clearly defined its role which is in the primary health sector. therefore, it has set for itself a goal of an increased outlay of 55 per cent in the primary health sector, 35 per cent in secondary, and only 10 per cent increase in the area of specialised care. union health minister c.p. thakur said the policy should get finalised in about a fortnight. he said the last policy was formulated in 1983 and since then the health scene has changed dramatically requiring a more exhaustive approach. a controversial aspect of the policy is a suggestion to expand the pool of medical practitioners by including a cadre of licentiates of medical practice (lmp) as also practitioners of indian systems of medicine. it suggests that this groups could provide some of the basic primary health services in under-served areas. lmps are not qualified medical practitioners but are equipped with only some information on basic medicines. it talks about modifying the medical curriculum to enable fresh graduates to contribute to the primary health services. ""a need-based skill-oriented syllabus, with a significant component of practical training would make fresh doctors useful immediately after graduation."" the policy also envisages the setting up of an organised urban primary health structure. it suggests a two-tiered structure, with the primary health centre providing the first tier and a second tier of a government general hospital. the policy suggests increase in the government-funded medical research to a level of one per cent of the total health spending by 2005 and up to 2 per cent by 2010. it should focus on new drugs, vaccines for tropical disease, such as tb and malaria as also the sub-types of hiv present in the country. for appropriate regulations on the private sector, it says legislations on minimum infrastructure as well as quality standards should be in place by 2003. ""private insurance instruments,"" it says, should be set up to provide a cover to those seeking secondary and tertiary care.

17,Bikaner gearing up to implement govt scheme,"bikaner: the district administration is gearing itself up for the state government`s ambitious ``administration with villages'' programme. the three month-long programme would start on october 2, the birth anniversary of mahatma gandhi. district collector nirmal kumar vadhvani convened a meeting of administrative and revenue officers in this regard on monday and tuesday. while the the state government would set up the broad guidelines, target-setting and implementation strategies would be chalked out by the respective district administration. vadhvani said the entire district would be divided into seven blocks and two ras officers would be made incharge of each block. these officers would be given powers of assistant collectors so that on-the-spot decisions are taken. he said matters like distribution of passbooks, record of rights, mutation, divisions and revenue collections would be done on the spot. vadhvani said on the social security sector the integrated child development schemes , pensions to disabled and widows would be taken up on a priority basis. targets would be set for each party which will remain in each village panchayat for two days and incase the performance is not satisfactory supplementary camps would be organised. these camps assumes significance because the state government has lifted the long-imposed ban on land allotment in desert districts.

18,Confusion rules govt handling of agriculture,"new delhi: exemplifying confusion in the government, separate committees in two central ministries agriculture and consumer affairs are looking at similar issues. one such issue is of the forward and futures market. the jurisdiction distinction is blurred. this was just one of the examples that came up during a day-long seminar, organised by the federation of indian chambers of commerce and industry and the agriculture ministry on monday, on the role of private sector in agricultural marketing. there is similar confusion, even contradiction, in the plethora of rules and laws restricting trade and attempting to set quality standards, be it the ``zero tolerance'' prevention of food adulteration act, agmark, the bureau of indian standards, or any other. each ministry is thinking from its own perspective, said industry representatives. yet, at the end of it all, there is no product where india meets world standards; the closest we come is in wheat. the restrictions, a state playing field, can be so killing it would be easier for a state like kerala to import wheat from australia where only one license would be required than to get it from punjab that would require three. these straws in the wind from the seminar are indicative not just of the huge overhaul effort required, but industry's desire for the government to get out of the business of management into a supportive, facilitative, umpire role. the point was made repeatedly, even ministry officials acknowledging the government cannot sustain the momentum without the private sector. they have an inter-ministerial task force, with nine sub-groups, looking at the whole gamut of issues right now. there is no end to the confusion. agricultural education is a state subject; otherwise, it's on the concurrent list. the regulatory framework ensures a state monopoly ^ nobody else can set up a market. what it has led to are markets which are essentially post-harvest assembly places, markets which are not consumer-oriented and where the stranglehold of arhtias is complete. the point seems to have been acknowledged, in limited fashion, by agriculture minister ajit singh liberalisation should have preceded globalisation. the challenge is to enable the farmer to get to technology, newer markets and a reasonable rate of return for produce.

19,Warring ministers give Marandi sleepless nights,"ranchi: keeping nda partners together has become an unhill task for chief minister babulal marandi here with alliance ministers, of late, getting engaged in a game of one-upmanship, one after another. all this has become a constant cause for embarrassment for the government. however, marandi has so far failed to set his (nda) house in order. not satisfied with cabinet berths in the government complete with accompanying facilities and perks, these warring ministers are frequently in the news either for their unending tiffs with bureaucrats or game of one-upmanship among themselves, caring little it would bring bad name to the government. after a series of blistering attacks on the bureaucracy of jharkhand for not toeing their (ministers) line and ultimately succeeding in getting ""unwanted officials"" shifted, the two ministers -- urban development minister bachcha singh and science and technology minister samresh singh -- are now at loggerheads in a bid to gain supremacy in coal unions of dhanbad and jharia. it all started with urban development minister and samata strongman bachcha singh attempting to encroach upon samresh singh's territory in bokaro and the latter retaliating by organising a public meeting in jharia, known to be the stronghold of the former. ""who is bachcha singh to challenge my position?"" samresh reportedly asked in bokaro. not hesitant to wash their dirty linen in public, a series of mud-slinging by the duo followed, which unfortunately, shows no signs of abating. and now with a third minister, p n singh, who has the industries portfolio, intervening and urging both the ministers ""to show restraint and concentrate on work and not do unionbaazi"", things are now set to take a turn for the worse. while the power minister, lalchand mahto, has from day one created one controversy after the other, other alliance ministers too have not lagged behind with their constant tirades against babus of the state. two ministers from the samata party namely ramesh singh munda and ramchander kesri had also indulged in mud-slinging. even as an nda coordination committee is to be formed to look into such matters and remove differences among the alliance partners in the government, the chief minister's failure to discipline his partners, has provided an opportunity to the opposition to heap charges of inefficiency on the government.

20,Govt modifies order on foreigners,"new delhi: the union home ministry has reviewed the controversial foreigners (report to police) order, 1971, and decided there is no legal obligation for citizens to inform the police, whenever foreigners visit or stay in their homes. the home ministry's determination to enforce the 1971 order first reported in the times of india two months ago had evoked widespread criticism from nris and others concerned about infringement of civil liberties. the ministry of external affairs had also expressed unhappiness at the revival of what, it felt, was an anachronistic order. ``following protests in the media, the home ministry reconsidered the order and recently renotified the amended order,'' special secretary and home ministry spokesman p d shenoy said here on tuesday. ``under the new order, citizens are not expected to inform the police if they have a foreign guest staying overnight at their residence. however, if somebody does not have a valid travel document or has overstayed in the country ^ in other words, is an illegal entrant ^ then the host must inform the police.'' in the immediate aftermath of this paper's report, ministry officials had said it would be amended to apply only to visitors from pakistan and bangladesh. but critics had said that even this amounted to an unfair burden on the indian hosts.

21,High Court unhappy with govt’s version,"patna: the patna high court on tuesday expressed dissatisfaction at the counter-affidavit of the state government in the case alleging irregularities in selection of freedom fighters for payment of pension under the central scheme. a division bench, comprising chief justice r s dhavan and justice s k singh, termed as 'unsatisfactory' the plea offered by the state government that the union home ministry is ultimately responsible for giving pension to the freedom fighters. the union of india's senior standing counsel, j p karn, submitted before the court some judgments passed by the patna high court earlier and stated that these verdicts highlighted the callousness of the state government in making indiscriminate recommendations for the grant of freedom fighters' pension. karn added that the union of india does not have its independent machinery to verify the claim and evidences furnished by the claimants seeking grant of freedom fighters' pension. for this, the union of india relies upon the state government, he added. the court had earlier initiated suo motu a case on the basis of a news report published in an english daily alleging a racket in selection of freedom fighters for grant of pension. the standing counsel of the state government, r k dutta, said that a member of the state advisory committee (sac) for freedom fighters' pension, tripurari sharan singh, had earlier recommended names of several persons for payment of pension. but later he denied having knowledge about the persons, whose name only he had recommended. the state government's counter-affidavit claimed that the news report (on the basis of which the case had taken shape) was not based on facts and records. the allegations made in the news report, especially with respect to the state government and its officials, are false and baseless, the counter-affidavit added. dutta submitted that in response to the union of india's letter regarding the news report, the state government had issued directive to all the concerned district magistrates to submit a report about the beneficiaries of the freedom fighters' pension scheme.
