1,Plot allotment scheme assumes political colour,"faridkot: the dalits of bhana village of the district are up in arms against the sarpanch of the village for depriving them of the benefits of the punjab government scheme for allotment of plots to landless labourers. an agitation, demanding dismissal of sarpanch pritam singh, has been launched by the landless labourers of the village under the aegis of the punjab khet mazdoor union. it is being alleged that the sarpanch, a staunch shiromani akali dal (badal) supporter, was against the implementation of the plot allotment scheme in the village as most of the beneficiaries were not loyal to the sad. though the punjab khet mazdoor union, through a long drawn agitation, succeeded in compelling the village panchayat to pass a resolution dated november 12, 2001 declaring 75 families eligible to get benefit of the scheme, but most of the real beneficiaries were allegedly left out at the behest of the sarpanch. when objections were raised against the alleged partiality of the panchayat, an inquiry was conducted on the directions of the faridkot deputy commissioner in which many beneficiaries were found to be bogus. annoyed at the inquiry, the panchayat passed another resolution dated december 15, 2001 in which only 11 families, alleged to be favourites of the sarpanch, were shown as beneficiaries.this led to a widespread resentment among the landless. an agitation has now been launched by the punjab khet mazdoor union against the akali dominated panchayat with the demand to dismiss the sarpanch for misusing his office for political motives. at least 100 residents of the village have written to the national commission for scheduled castes and scheduled tribes for taking action against the sarpanch for his anti-dalit attitude. according to pritam singh, the scheme was not being implemented in the village as the panchayat had no land to distribute among the beneficiaries. however, the revenue record showed that the panchayat owned about 11 acres of land. amrik singh, the district president of the punjab khet mazdoor union, alleged that the sarpanch was victimising the landless labourers of the village as the latter had refused to toe his political line.

3,"Private blood banks vital, rules or no rules","lucknow: private blood banks continue to be the mainstay for thousands of patients who everyday throng government hospitals for transfusion. for the patients, it does not matter much if these banks adhere to the conditions laid under the rule, so long their demands are met. of the required quantity of blood for transfusion, 60 per cent was provided by the government-owned banks, and for the rest, private banks came to the rescue of patients and nursing homes, said a senior doctor of the sgpgi. a senior pathologist of balrampur hospital and in-charge of blood bank dr r b agrawal said that of the 500 unit daily requirement of blood, only 60 per cent was being provided by the state's blood banks. on an average, the daily requirement of blood in kgmc is 1000 units. here again, only 60 per cent of the requirement is met by the government-owned banks, said a doctor of the kgmc. the state has 116 blood banks, of which 41 are private. medical colleges and military hospitals each have 10. besides, district hospitals have 55 such banks. interestingly, none of those banks are located in rural areas when majority of the patients come from villages. balrampur hospital started its blood bank last year although a state-owned blood bank is located on its premises. these banks are supposed to keep blood at four to six degree centigrade for 72 hours. since the government did not have enough technical personnel to monitor these banks on day-to-day basis, they were left to their own discretion, said mr m saxena of the health directorate. aware of the ground reality the state government had made a fervent plea before the supreme court that there should not be much pre-condition for allowing private blood banks to function. the apex court in 1996 had ruled that there would be no blood banks without elisa reader, an instrument to test aids, hepatitis-b and malaria contents in blood. an official of the health directorate told this correspondent that the conditions imposed under the rule for starting blood banks were rigorous. if the terms and conditions were really enforced, most of the private banks would be forced to shut down, leaving patients high and dry, said the official. private banks, manager of the such a bank said, faced problems owing to ambiguity in the law. while the drug and cosmetics act said that installation of incinerators was essential for private banks, the state's pollution control board had stopped giving permission for any such thing on the plea that it increased environmental pollution, he said.

4,Tandon rival for clean politics,"lucknow: a debutante in state level politics, noted criminal lawyer and samajwadi party candidate from lucknow west virendra bhatia is a confident man. neither criminals nor corrupt people can stand before me, he says. his usp: uttar pradesh does not need 'professional' politicians. it needs professionals and politicians. and bhatia feels he fills the slot of being the two-in-one, a professional and a politician. having held a plethora of posts in his student days and professional life — he has served as junior librarian and secretary of the lucknow university students union from 1962 to 1971 and has been president of the oudh bar association for four years, in addition to being an office bearer of a host of social organizations, bhatia is all set to introduce the concept of 'clean politics'. today politicians have become 'professionals', their objective is not the welfare of the public, but their own welfare. this accounts for the debasement which has seeped in 'rajniti'. but the time has come for intellectuals to enter the fray. when i was approached by party president mulayam singh yadav i readily accepted because criminalisation of politics cannot be allowed to continue unchecked. intellectuals and professionals have to step in to stem the rot he said. the sp candidate is optimistic that over 5000 intellectuals residing in his constituency would realise the import of his statement and extend support to him in his cause of clean politics. to buttress his point, he recalls the pre-1971 days. it was lawyers and doctors who dominated the political scene before the seventies. the entire freedom movement had for its mainstay the lawyers community. did you hear of corruption then, is his counter. but how does he intend to counter a formidable adversary, the minister of urban development and tourism lalji tandon? it is for the public to decide who is more formidable — tandon or bhatia, the bjp or the sp. every party has the same motto — roti, kapda aur makan — but who eventually realises these three basics for the public is important. it is here that the individual matters. but hasn't tandon done a lot for the old city? i would not like to comment on this. but give me the same amount of money and i will change the face of lucknow, he says. bhatia, who has already hit the campaign trail, holds that the bjp and its leaders are in for a sound thrashing at the hustings as they stand fully exposed. their double speak on a host of issues, failure to carry out any development work and anti-people policies would work to their disadvantage. the sp and mulayam singh, on the contrary, are far above them — at least they do what they say is his opinion about the party and the leader he has chosen to represent. with around 4 lakh electorate spread over 28 wards, lucknow west has a sizeable section of muslim voters who number about 1.50 lakhs. the hindu voters number around 2.50 lakh.

5,Nagi Reddy spits fire at TD minister Farooq,"kurnool: the internal squabbles among the district telugu desam leaders continued on sunday even as the ongoing janmabhoomi programme appears to have become a platform for the ruling telugu desam party leaders to settle personal scores. if it was kurnool mla t g venkatesh's reported outburst at a minister the other day, it was the turn of nandyal mp bhuma nagi reddy on sunday, who criticised municipal administration minister n md farooq for inaugurating a newly constructed road near bollavaram village in mahanandi mandal. nagi reddy, speaking at a janmabhoomi gram sabha at bollavaram village of mahanandi mandal, warned that he would not tolerate the minister's negligent attitude towards public representatives in the district. he was annoyed at the minister as the latter had inaugurated a new road on sunday for which funds worth rs 14 lakh were reportedly sanctioned by mp nagi reddy under the prime minister's grameen sadak yojana. the comments created a flutter in the telugu desam circles as the chief minister personally intervened only three days ago to solve the differences between kurnool mla t g venkatesh and the group led by kurnool mp k e krishna murthy. while t g venkatesh has been maintaining a low profile after the chief minister personally spoke to him, nagi reddy's comments on farooq on saturday once again brought to fore the uneasy calm in telugu desam in kurnool district. the cm had intervened as three ministers b v mohan reddy, k e prabhakar, n md farooq and kurnool mp k e krishna murthy telephoned naidu against venkatesh. the internal squabbles in the district appear to continue unabated as the dissident group leaders are still unhappy with the attitude of td ministers, particularly n md farooq and e prabhakar. meanwhile, transport minister b mohan reddy has reportedly spoken to dissident mlas s v subba reddy,shobha nagi reddy,byreddy rajasekhar reddy, bijjam parthasarathi reddy and budda seetharami reddy regarding his participation in janmabhoomi in their respective constituencies.

7,Joshi warns of farmers' uprising in the state,"pune: prominent farmer-leader sharad joshi has warned the state government of state-wide unrest over the ""unfair treatment being meted out to farmers"". joshi has cautioned that in the next two months, parallel administrations would crop up in all districts of the state, on the lines of the historic patri sarkar resistance put up by nanasaheb patil against the british in satara in 1942. the bureaucrat-turned-leader, who has been waging a battle for higher prices for cotton farmers under the banner of his shetkari sanghatana, was delivering the jayantrao tilak lecture at the pune union of working journalists here, on the occasion of the marathi journalists' day on sunday. justifying his stand that farmers should evade payment of power and water bills, the sanghatna leader said the government was like an alcoholic husband always in the need of money for its lopsided policies. ""in any case, the erratic electricity supply creates more problems for farmers rather than solving them,"" he thundered. he also suggested that the government should supply meter-based electricity instead of basing it on the capacity of engine pumps installed by farmers. accusing successive central governments of framing antifarmer policies, joshi said planners never actually tried to ensure a fair price for the agricultural produce for peasants. ""not only did the government put restrictions on the movement of agricultural produce, it also denied a fair price for it under various monopoly schemes,"" he said. citing the example of cotton, joshi said the state government should be giving at least 20 per cent over and above the minimum support price as compensation to farmers who have to sell their entire crop to the state under the monopoly procurement scheme. ""forget anything extra, the state is asking the helpless farmers to accept 80 per cent of the msp for cotton under the monopoly scheme,"" he said. joshi claimed the government, far from ensuring decent minimum support price, had excelled at negative subsidies. quoting official figures submitted by the commerce ministry at the wto, he said government offered an msp of rs 100 for a produce costing rs 183. even the wto actually permitted developing countries to give 10 per cent subsidy to its farmers, he argued. joshi said the government had played truant even in sugarcane with a set of strange rules. he ridiculed the circular of the sugar commissionerate warning of action against sugar factories buying sugarcane from outside fixed zones, at prices higher than rs 560. ""in case the government cannot support the farmers, then it should at least not behave like an home-grown enemy,"" he remarked. enter the iconoclast! joshi on sunday explained that he had asked his supporters to destroy statues of the nehru and gandhi dynasty so that chief minister vilasrao deshmukh and his bosses in delhi understood the level of anger among the farmers in the state. moreover, joshi said the congress goverment should stop the hypocrisy of praising nehruvian economics as the socialist policies had been completely substituted by free-market trade practises. reacting to threats of state congress president govindrao adik, joshi said he was ready to face punishment for destroying the statues of nehru and gandhi. but the peasant leader was quick to add that adik should also be ready to face punishment for doing harm to him.

9,Teachers oppose govt move to appoint 'para-teachers',"patna: more than 31,000 posts of teachers are lying vacant in the government primary and middle schools of bihar. the total number of sanctioned posts of teachers in the government primary and middle schools is 1,78,091 whereas the number of teachers working in these schools is only 1,46,328, said bihar primary teachers' association (bpta) functionaries brajnandan sharma and mahendra shahi in a recent interview with times news network here at shikshak bhavan, the bpta headquarters. when contacted, minister for primary education, parliamentary affairs and transport ramchandra purbey confirmed these vacancies, adding that the rules for appointment of ""para-teachers"" on these vacant posts would be finalised very shortly and that the posts would be filled immediately thereafter. new transfer rules for primary teachers and change in promotion rules for filling 7,000 posts of headmasters lying vacant in middle schools would also be finalised very shortly, he maintained. the bpta functionaries, however, opposed the state government move, saying that all these vacant posts of teachers should be filled with regular trained teachers and not with ""para-teachers"" as proposed by officials of the primary education department and that this should be done with immediate effect if the government really wants to improve the quality of primary education in the state. they said a state government report placed before the members of a planning commission action group during their visit last year confirmed that 50 lakh children in the state in the age group of 6-14 years have been left out of the school system. eight per cent of 'tolas', each having a population of more than 300, are bereft of school facility within one-km radius. the state government has failed to take any major steps for narrowing the vast gap in enrolment in primary schools and that in middle schools. at present, this is in the ratio of 4:1. the state government had proposed to bring this down to 2:1 under the ongoing universalisation of education scheme, said the bpta functionaries. they maintained that the government has failed to check the student dropout rate, which is 59 per cent in the case of boys and 58.81 per cent in the case of girls. the dropout rate in the case of scheduled caste and scheduled tribe students is 60.71 per cent and 56.22 per cent respectively. according to government statistics, the total number of primary schools without building in the state is 4,629. out of a total of 37,381 primary and 9,834 middle schools, drinking water facility has been provided to only 22,648 primary and 238 middle schools. the government had proposed to provide toilet facility for girl students in 5,431 middle schools. the remaining schools were to be provided with drinking water and toilet facilities by 2003. but even on this front the government has failed to make any headway as yet, said the bpta functionaries. they expressed their serious concern over the government's failure in ensuring regular salary payment to primary teachers in the state. the government primary school teachers are normally paid their salary after four to six months, they said. the bpta functionaries said the government's decision to impose a total ban on requisitioning of government primary school teachers for non-teaching work has proved to be ineffective. these schools have remained partially or fully closed for almost two months in a year due to the requisitioning of their teachers for such work as preparation of electoral rolls, panchayat polls and census work, they added.

25,New law to fight organised crime,"new delhi: the delhi police have acquired a new weapon to fight organised crime. police commissioner ajai raj sharma on monday announced the introduction of maharashtra control of organised crime act or mcoca in delhi. mcoca will empower the police with unprecedented powers and authority. they will now be able to tap phones, attach property, question the source of a suspect's income...the list goes on. also confessional statements made in the presence of a deputy commissioner of police will be admissible in court as will be tape recordings and recorded phone conversations. another notable feature of mcoca is that certain sections even evoke the death penalty. at present, a person can only be sentenced to death under the indian penal code and after a second conviction under the narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances act. ""i have some bad news for criminals in delhi. this year is going to be very tough for them,"" said sharma, while speaking at the annual press conference. he added that the government had cleared mcoca and it was only a matter of days before the act came into effect. but not everyone is as thrilled as the police. ""this will unleash police brutality and abuse of power on an unparalleled scale. there are many things we can learn from mumbai, but this is not one of them,"" cautioned senior advocate rajeev dhawan. others questioned the need for an ""anti organised crime act"" considering that the delhi police has over half a decade been consistently denying the presence of any organised crime. sharma, however, claims the act is being introduced keeping in view emerging crime trends, rather than history. he termed the implementation of the act a ""preventive"" measure to cope with the expected spread of organised crime in the future. the announcement about mcoca came while sharma was giving a round-up of last year's crime figures in the capital. he claimed to have brought down crime in the city by 3.32 per cent in 2001. the figure, however, is lower than the figure posted last year. in 2000, crime had dropped by 4.9 per cent from the previous year. it was with some pride that sharma told mediapersons that his men had been able to combat crime effectively.
