0,BKU plans agitation against govt to get cases withdrawn,"BATHINDA: Thousands of farmers and leaders of the Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU-Ekta) are contemplating to start an agitation against the state government for not fulfilling its promise of withdrawing criminal cases against about 300 BKU leaders and members in Bathinda and Mansa districts.

Union leaders said that in October last year, Punjab CM Amarinder Singh had promised to withdraw the criminal cases registered against the union leaders during various agitations, but no concrete step had been taken in this regard so far.

District BKU President Janda Singh Jethuke said that during a meeting in the last week of September 2002, the chief minister had assured the farmers that all cases would be withdrawn and on October 2, the district police was directed by the chief minister''s office to provide the list and details of cases registered against the farmers.

Though the necessary details were furnished by the district police authorities about seven months back, no action was taken, said Janda Singh.

About 300 farmers and BKU leaders are making rounds of the courts in Bathinda and Mansa districts after the police registered criminal cases against them for disrupting railway traffic, and laying siege on banks and government officers since 2000.

In the Jethuke incident in January 2000, criminal cases against 34 persons were registered after two youths were killed in alleged police firing when the farmers were blocking railway traffic. In Maisharkhana, four FIRs were registered against 154 persons, including four women, after a scuffle between the police and union workers on the Bathinda-Mansa road in June 2001.

The other case pertains to union leaders participating in an agitation to get a farmer released from police custody at Rampura Phool after he was arrested for recovery of loan.

Police sources said that despite working out all the modalities for withdrawing the cases, the state government changed its mind, sensing that withdrawal of the cases would embolden BKU leaders.

In southern Punjab, particularly Bathinda, Mansa and Sangrur where the BKU has a hold on farmers, every now and then farmers resort to blocking traffic. Two months ago, the Muktsar, Bathinda and Mansa police had booked a number of BKU activists after they blocked traffic for four hours at various places during a state-wide agitation.

1,Border farmers waiting for the ice to thaw,"GANGANAGAR/ABOHAR: It is time to build bridges again. For the leaders it is an opportunity to smile into the television cameras; for the foreign ministers another few weeks of hectic affairs; and for the bureaucrats, a few months of scripting the proceedings.

But, in the latest peace initiative between the belligerent neighbours, there is a flicker of hope again for thousands of residents in this border area. For years, the Indo-Pakistan feud had crippled their lives and economic progress.

The mobilisation of troops on a massive scale and the installation artillery, along either side of the border, had disrupted their routine life. And now, when both the countries are making an attempt to improve bilateral relations, the people here are hoping that celebrations would finally begin.

Sardul Singh, a farmer in Fatuhi village, said residents would be more happy than the families of soldiers. Villagers had been on a move since the deployment of troops in December, 2001, migrating to safer areas whenever tension mounted between India and Pakistan, he said. Since most of farmers along the border have small land holdings, the loss was huge for them, he said, adding, displacement also brought problems of managing livestock and fodder.

Though government awarded compensation to those who suffered losses owing to mobilisation of troops and installation of military outfits in their fields, yet there was little that could be done to drive away the looming fear.

Many residents even lost their lives and limbs in landmine explosions in various villages here. Also, the anti-tank and antipersonnel landmines installed along the border led to deaths of numerous animals.

Another villager said landmines were laid just two acres away from their village and it was difficult to keep a watch on children and cattle all the time. In a border village in Fazilka six children were injured in various landmine explosions. In October, 2002 there were more than 20 landmine explosions near the Indo-Pak border in Goluke village.

3,'Nation is not safe in saffron brigade's rule',"KANPUR: Senior Samajwadi Party leader Janeshwar Mishra said that the country was not safe under the rule of communal parties.

Mishra, who was in the city to flag off the bicycle rally of the party, on Sunday said that the prime minister had been issuing contradictory statements with the passing of every day.

4,He played Holi with accused instead of arresting them,"HYDERABAD: It could have been straight out of a Bollywood thriller, but it was played out for the real in Hyderabad: A police inspector plays Holi with the residents of the area where he is posted. Rubbing shoulders with not just the inspector but also other senior police officials are two persons accused in a case of attempt to outrage the modesty of two women. The inspector is to arrest the two accused, instead he chooses to play with them.

It was on the Holi day in March this year that Chandrayanagutta police inspector P Prabhakar Reddy took part in the festival with Ahmed Nizami and Saood Baom, the two men against whom a criminal case had been filed at the Chandrayanagutta police station barely two months earlier.

Nizami is said to be a member of the local Maithri Committee, a panel of local residents who are supposed to help the police in maintaining law and order when required.

In attendance on the day for playing Holi were Chatrinaka assistant commissioner of police K Muralidhar Rao and the rest of the staff of the Chandrayanagutta police station. And for the record, some constables even took pictures of the occasion.

Both Nizami and Saood Baom were accused of attempting to outrage the modesty of a girl and her mother and a case was registered on January 9, 2003 at the Chandrayanagutta police station.

The complainant, Mehboob Bee, a resident of Jahangeerabad, had stated that Nizami, Baom and others barged into her house, damaged the household articles and tried to outrage her modesty and that of her daughter.

Mehboob Bee stated that the assailants were forcing her to vacate the house her family had built with great difficulty in Jahangeerabad and the gang attacked her when she refused to vacate the place.

In a petition to the deputy commissioner of police (south) and the city police commissioner, Mehboob Bee also stated that she had lodged a complaint with the Chandrayanagutta police on December 24, 2002 after the gang damaged her house and attempted to outrage the modesty of her daughter.However, no action had been taken by the police, she said.

Following her second petition to the senior officials, the Chandrayanagutta police had to register a criminal case but did not try to arrest the accused in the case.

When asked why the accused have not been arrested, Prabhakar Reddy told The Times of India on Sunday that the Chandrayanagutta residents are ""petition mongers and keep filing false complaints.""

""The complaint lodged by Mehboob Bee is of a civil nature and the same has been conveyed to the court. There is no need to arrest the accused,"" the police inspector added.

5,Hacking of trees triggers protest,"KOLKATA: The hacking of four trees near the Mahatma Gandhi Road-Central Avenue crossing sparked off a row in the area on Sunday. The trees had been planted by the Kolkata Municipal Corporation about three years ago and nurtured by local residents, who staged a protest.

â€œAround 1.30 am on Sunday the trees were pruned in presence of three officers of the local police station,â€� said local councillor Shameem Anwar Khan. The branches were coming in the way of a billboard, alleged Khan.

Trees are trimmed with permission from the KMC when they obstruct traffic or are in danger of breaking off. â€œBut, the police showed us a permission issued by the KMC which is vague about where the trees are to be trimmed,â€� said Khan. A complaint has been lodged at the Jorasanko police station and a mass petition submitted demanding action.

6,'Food riot' at UN leaves Annan hungry,"UNITED NATIONS: It was a virtual ""food riot"" at the United Nations cafeterias when workers went on a whirlwind strike on Friday and left their workstations.

The trouble started when the outgoing food contractor informed workers that their vacation pay, which had not been cleared till May 2, will be the responsibility of the new contractor. But even the new contractor said it will not honour that. Hungry patrons, including diplomats and staff members, helped themselves to everything in sight, even silverware.

Some who had fridges in their offices stuffed them with enough food to last a few days.

Even the bar in the diplomatic lounge was not spared. Diplomats and others helped themselves to the liquor with no one prevent the ""looting"" or charging money.

Among the ones left stranded were UN Secretary General Kofi Annan and members of the Security Council, who were holding their private monthly luncheon in the delegates'' dining room. They were served only the main course and left to fend for themselves desserts and coffee. There was no one to clear the tables.

A food contractor''s official estimated that food worth $ 7,000 to $ 9,000 may have been ""looted"", and that excludes the ""raid"" on the delegate lounge''s bar.

The Restaurants Associates, which had the contract for running UN canteens and cafeterias for the last 17 years, lost their bid to Aramark Corporation, the largest food service company in the US, in March.

Friday was the last day of the Restaurants Associates contract. The new contractor starts work on Monday. The new contractor arrived at an understanding with the workers union only later in the day.

8,Bill to strengthen anti-deflection law introduced in LS,"NEW DELHI: The government on Monday introduced in the Lok Sabha a constitutional amendment bill to strengthen the anti-defection law and peg the size of the Council of Ministers to not more than 10 per cent of respective strengths of Parliament and State legislatures.

Following suggestions by Congress and other Opposition members that the bill be sent to a Standing Committee, Law and Justice Minister Arun Jaitley said the government itself was committed to a larger consensus on it.

Observing that the bill in any case would not be able to secure Parliament''s approval in this session, he said government has no objection in referring it to the Standing Committee.

Jaitley said that the government proposed to accept the suggestions made by the Dinesh Goswami Committee, Law Commission of India and the National Commission to Review the Working of the Constitution (NCRWC) to omit para three of the 10th Schedule pertaining to exemption from disqualification in case of splits.

Referring to the abnormally large Council of Ministers being constituted by various governments at the Centre and in States, the NCRWC suggested a ceiling of 10 per cent of the total strength of the House be fixed.

Jaitley said the bill seeks to amend the Constitution by omitting para three of the 10th Schedule and to provide that the size of the Council of Ministers should not be more than 10 per cent of the strength of House or Houses concerned whether unicameral or bicameral.

10,Case against Hindujas politically motivated: Jethmalani,"NEW DELHI: Senior lawyer Ram Jethmalani on Monday reiterated before the Supreme Court that the three Hinduja brothers were being subjected to persecution through the Bofors pay-off case, which, he said, was in fact a politically motivated action by the government.

Supporting a Delhi High Court judgment quashing the chargesheet against the Hindujas, Jethmalani said that all the public servants arraigned as accused in the case were dead.

A Bench of Justices S Rajendra Babu and G P Mathur, which is seized of the CBI''s appeal against the High Court order, would hear the CBI''s contention on Tuesday.

Jethmalani said the Hinduja brothers were being harassed only to draw political mileage. He also showed to the court that BJP in its election manifesto in 1999 had made a point to vigorously pursue the 12-year-old corruption case.

He said if the BJP was so concerned about corruption, why did it not take up other corruption cases that were pending for more than 12 years in the courts.

Jethmalani read out letters from the CBI to the Swiss authorities requesting transfer of certain documents which had mentioned that Bofors was ``politically the most sensitive case''''.

He said the apex court, while delivering the judgment in the Vineet Narain (hawala) case, had entrusted superintendence of CBI to the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) so that cases under political patronage could be pursued vigorously and to stop harassment of the innocent at the behest of the political bosses.

The Bofors case being politically a most sensitive case as per the admission of the CBI, the investigating agency should have taken mandatory clearance from the CVC, as directed by the apex court, counsel added.

The CBI has said that the High Court had misinterpreted the hawala case judgment and also misconstrued the word `superintendence''. It maintained that the judgment nowhere gave powers to the CVC to exercise control over the kind of chargesheets being filed by the agency.

11,Retrenched GMCH sweepers protest,"CHANDIGARH: Retrenched safai karamcharis staged a demonstration near the Emergency block of Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) on Monday.

Shouting slogans against the contractor - Prehari Security and Detective Services, they demanded immediate re-employment. Over 200 persons took part in demonstration.

Alleging that they had been asked to leave at once without any reason, the demonstrators also said that ""anti-socials"" brought down by the contractor were ""threatening to kill them"". A complaint to this effect has been forwarded to the office of GMCH Director-principal Dr SBS Mann with the request of initiating proceedings at the earliest.

""We have been thrown out for no fault of our own. Ever since the new contractor took over, things have gone haywire. On Saturday, they forcibly took Rs 500 from us as security money without issuing any receipt. On Sunday, they brought down about 50 persons armed with weapons who tried their level best to shoo us away. They even threatened to kill us. We are poor people who have nowhere to go. What have we done to be treated like this,"" said Rattan Kumar, president, Contractual Sweeper Union, GMCH.

He further alleged that some of the safai karamcharis were even manhandled.

""They even slapped me when I asked the reason as to why we were shown the door. Who is going to support our families now. We will land on the streets,"" said Brajesh, a safai karamchari. Retrenched women employees accused those posted at the Prehari Security control room of being drunk during duty hours and making unwarranted advances.

Rubbishing the allegations, Kamaljit Singh, managing director, Prehari Security and Detective Services, said, ""The allegations are baseless. We have only removed 48 safai karamcharis who were not doing any work. As per GMCH rules, there are 198 sanctioned posts of safai karamcharis. These employees were in excess and we removed them.""

12,"Pak offers no-nuke deal, Jamali holds all-party meet","ISLAMABAD: Pakistan on Monday raised the stakes in nascent peace overtures with India, saying it would junk its nuclear arsenal if its South Asian rival did the same.

It also hailed a ""positive"" response to its invitation for Prime Minister Vajpayee to visit Pakistan.

In another development, Pakistan Prime Minister Mir Zafarullah Khan Jamali on Monday night held a meeting with leaders of major political parties, seeking to build a consensus on the peace initiative with India. Islamabad has virtually backed New Delhiâ€™s stand that careful preparations were needed for summit-level talks.

Leaders of Pakistanâ€™s political parties, which have representation in the national assembly, attended the meeting held at the official residence of Jamali, two days after he extended a formal invitation to Vajpayee to visit Islamabad for talks.

President Pervez Musharraf, in an interview to a private Pakistani television channel, said Pakistan could work for a no-war pact with India followed by mutual reduction of troops and de-nuclearisation of South Asia if the Kashmir issue was resolved.

Asserting that Pakistan was ready for a composite bilateral dialogue at any level to discuss all outstanding issues, including Kashmir, foreign ministry spokesman Aziz Ahmed Khan said Islamabad was also ready to get rid of its nuclear arsenal if India did the same.

Khan said Pakistan was not disappointed about Vajpayeeâ€™s suggestion for careful ground work before the summit-level talks.

""As far as Pakistan is concerned, if India is ready to denuclearise, we would be happy to denuclearise,"" Khan said. ""But it will have to be mutual.""

There was no immediate response from New Delhi. Pakistan insists it developed nuclear weapons in response to the perceived threat from India, and has called for a nuclear-free zone in South Asia.

India has rejected the idea, saying its nuclear program is not driven by Pakistan alone â€” an apparent reference to China. India has recently tried to improve relations with China. But there have been no indications so far from New Delhi that warmer ties with Beijing or the thaw with Islamabad could persuade it to consider disarming.

""We have received a response ... it is a positive response,"" Khan said. ""We hope that the process of talks will start very soon."" He declined to give details.

The external affairs ministry spokesman in New Delhi Navtej Sarna said Vajpayee sent a letter to Jamali on Saturday, saying ""careful preparations had to be made on the ground before a meaningful and sustained dialogue"" could take place. He said there had been no developments since.

Earlier, Pakistanâ€™s President Pervez Musharraf has said his country could work for a no-war pact with India followed by mutual reduction of troops and de-nuclearisation of South Asia once the Kashmir issue is resolved.

In an interview to a Pakistani TV channel, Ary Gold, Musharraf said, ""Our concern is our security. We have been saying that if there is no problem to our security, Pakistan and India can move to mutual reduction of forces and have a no-war pact â€” this has been our stand.""

Musharraf dismissed reports that India and Pakistan agreed for a dialogue process due to pressure from the international community.

Musharraf declined to directly answer questions whether hardliners in the BJP had scuttled a settlement at the Agra summit.
