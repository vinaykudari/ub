2,Left attacks govt's flood handling,"patna: the cpi and the cpi(ml) have criticised the rabri government for its inept handling of flood and drought situation in bihar. state general secretary of the cpi md jalalluddin ansari expressed his disappointment over the state cabinet's decision to declare only a partial section of the state as drought-hit. he insisted that the entire state should have been declared drought-affected. ansari recalled that during the all party meet on flood and drought on august 10, the state government had promised to declare the entire state drought-hit. however, the state cabinet declared only 357 of the 515 blocks as drought-affected, he remarked, insisting that while 24 districts of the state were drought-hit, the remaining 13 districts were badly affected by floods. he alleged that the state government had failed to provide relief to the flood victims. in siwan and gopalganj districts alone, the toll due to floods was about 40, he added. ahmad charged the state government with mishandling flood relief and stressed that there were reports of starvation deaths. he demanded that the entire state should be declared affected by natural calamities and called for concrete administrative measures to ensure effective distribution of relief materials. the party also criticised the state government's decision to bifurcate the bihar state electricity board and alleged that the state government was following the union government's policy of privatisation. the cpi(ml), too, demanded that the entire state be declared drought-hit. party's state secretary ram jatan sharma said that it would be wrong to say that the all party delegation was the decision of each party.

4,Number plate rule has people foxed,"patna: utter confusion prevails among the people with regard to a new traffic rule that stipulates that vehicle owners should have white registration number plates with numerals in black. hundreds of vehicle owners are being forced to comply with the new directive at the earliest. a large number of vehicle owners complained about the ""high-handed attitude of police personnel"" who force them to replace their number plates in accordance with the new rule. many vehicle owners were seen getting a fresh coat of white paint on their number plates at different places in the city on friday. ""we are being forced to get a fresh coat of white paint on our number plates because the traffic police are charging exorbitant fine for not complying with the new directive,"" said rohit singh, a resident of pataliputra colony. ""painters are charging rs 40 for the job. nobody is aware about the rules and regulations,"" said a government official. at several busy commercial areas in patna, traffic remained blocked as a large number of vehicle owners queued up to get their number plates re-painted. most of them complained about the high-handed attitude of the police. the painters, on the other hand, seemingly enjoyed their job.honorary secretary of the automobile association of eastern india, patna branch, t k sinha admitted that vehicle owners are being forced to comply with the new directive.in a statement to the press, sinha said that the factual position as per the extraordinary gazette of india (march 28, 2001) stipulates that the specifically prescribed new number plates shall be applicable six months after issuing the notification, i.e. with effect from september 29, 2001. owners of the old vehicles have been given a grace period of two years from the effective date, he added

5,Flaws in building laws throttle open spaces,"mumbai: the ingredients are just right. take a three-storey residential building in pali, bandra. the 30-year-old structure needs drastic repairs, but the flat owners are unwilling or unable to raise money. enters mr builder, flush with tdr (transfer of development rights) and a proposal that leaves the residents salivating. the builder is ready to give a major facelift to the building -- stilt parking, two lifts, an intercom system, marble staircases. but that is not all. the developer has also agreed to disburse a staggering rs 2.34 crore among the 24 flat owners, all in return for allowing him to construct four additional floors on top of the existing structure, which he will sell in the open market and reap a bonanza. sounds like a win-win situation for both the occupants and the builder. but city planners say that indiscriminate use of tdr, which may have benefited some individuals, has actually ravaged the western suburbs between bandra and andheri, and the eastern suburbs between ghatkopar and chembur. almost a decade after the concept of tdr was incorporated in the development control regulations of 1991, housing experts point out that what was conceived as a development tool for creating more public amenities like playgrounds, parks and markets has today turned into a tradable commodity benefiting rapacious builders. for instance, the rampant and unplanned construction activity in the juhu-vile parle development (jvpd) scheme has shocked local residents, who find that their once tranquil neighbourhood has turned into a congested and overburdened enclave. the ""destructive power"" of tdr is clearly visible in this upmarket area. according to the town planning scheme, the plots here were meant for bungalow schemes. ""today, additional floors are being added to the existing buildings, open spaces and parking space have drastically reduced even as the population has increased. huge columns and beams have been constructed around the buildings to support the additional floors, affecting light and ventilation. side open spaces have been reduced to three metres between buildings, regardless of the height,"" say old-timers. in bandra west as well, hectic construction activity in the past four to five years has seen hideous buildings towering in quaint gullies. ""it is not just about putting additional floors, but whether these small lanes have the capacity to withstand the influx of residents and vehicular traffic,"" says advocate raju moray, a resident of bandra's almeida park. says housing expert and former mhada president chandrashekhar prabhu, ""the 1991 dc regulations had made it clear that there would be certain restrictions in using tdr in the suburbs. there was to be no tdr use between s.v. road and the railway stations in the west and between lbs marg, the eastern express highway and railway stations in the east."" he says that tdr was meant to be consumed only in selective places in the suburbs where it would not impose pressure on existing infrastructure. but such has been the rush to consume tdr that these considerations have been thrown to the winds. no thought has been given to the capacity of the area in terms of water, drainage, parking, road space and open spaces. last year, the juhu-vile parle development scheme tenants' and residents' association submitted an eye-opening report to chief minister vilasrao deshmukh about the impact of tdr in their area. the report asked the authorities to conduct a ""carrying capacity"" study to determine how much additional space each part of the city could sustain. ""the study must indicate how much additional recreational or other public space must be made available in an area before further floor space additions are permitted,"" it says, adding that tdr should be limited accordingly. according to the rules, tdr can be consumed north of where it is generated. but because of the peculiar geography of the city, an upmarket area like bandra reclamation lies north of a slum-dominated area like mankhurd on the map. ""this allows builders to buy slum tdr in mankhurd, where the rate is as low as rs 1,000 a sq ft. in lieu of that, they get to use tdr in an upmarket place like bandra west, where the rates vary between rs 8,000 to rs 12,000. many builders have made a killing,"" says mr prabhu. similarly, most of the tdr consumed in jvpd has been generated in the eastern suburbs, mainly kurla and ghatkopar, where the real estate rates are much lower than in juhu-vile parle. in areas like chembur, the use of tdr has safety implications. the shiv sena-bjp government led by narayan rane allowed the floor space index (fsi) to be increased from 0.75 to 1. combined with the 100 per cent use of slum tdr, the fsi, in fact, increased to 2 in this already congested eastern suburb. this has led to a sudden spurt of high-rises in an area where a conglomeration of sensitive installations like oil refineries, barc, a fertiliser plant and a naval ammunition depot had prompted the government to once limit fsi to just 0.5. a group of local citizens, led by h.k. clubwala, is currently opposing the construction of a tower complex in a small lane which clearly violates civil aviation norms. the civic administration has also recently considered a proposal to give tdr as payment to contractors for carrying out road concreting in the city, which activists say will only make the situation worse. ""tdr should be permitted only where infrastructure is augmented to take on the load increase. improve the infrastructure first, then permit tdr only to extent it can bear it,"" says mr prabhu.

6,'Agony Uncle' rushes to rescue harassed policy-holders,"mumbai: while most newspaper readers scan the headlines, glance at the obits, and perhaps catch a bit of city gossip with their morning tea, g. krishnamurthy scrutinises the grievances columns. the former chairman of the life insurance corporation of india (lic) is on the lookout for headlines like 'waiting for lic dues' or 'mediclaim not paid'. this soft-spoken bureaucrat has recently been appointed the 'agony uncle' of the insurance industry or, in official parlance, its ombudsman. recognising that insurance no longer revolves around the neighbourhood 'bima aunty' but is turning into a vast business which will touch more and more people, the government has picked 12 such ombudsmen across the country. as quasi-judicial officers, they are authorised to arbitrate personal insurance-related disputes involving up to rs 20 lakhs—quickly and for free. in just one year, mr krishnamurthy, ombudsman or 'lokpal' for maharashtra and goa, has calmed down distraught widows, jumped to the rescue of broke pensioners, and saved even a couple of well-heeled businesspersons a chunk of money which he deemed was rightfully due to them. as he puts it, ""my role is that of counsellor, advisor, mediator, judge. when looking into the matter, one considers the law—after all an insurance policy is a legal contract -- but within that, one has to use a lot of commonsense."" if, after bringing both parties to the mediating table, the matter is not resolved, the ombudsman has the authority to make an award, and it is binding on the company. the 'company' could be one of the oldies, like lic, oriental and new india, or any one of the new players -- such as icici-pru, tata-aig, hdfc, reliance, birla sunlife -- which have just entered the fray and are aggressively marketing policies and annuities to the public. although it is more likely that most disputes will arise from old-time lic and gic policy-holders, mr krishnamurthy says that a problem could potentially crop up even a month after a policy has been bought. he cites, for instance, an interesting case he recently resolved where the matter revolved around an 'unconcluded contract'. the policy-holder, a goa-based van driver, had started the process of buying a back-dated jeevan suraksha policy. he had paid the premium, but met with an accident before the paperwork, including the medical examination, was fully completed. after reviewing the matter, which had been going back and forth between the widow and the lic zonal office for more than two years, mr krishnamurthy convinced the insurers that they should pay up the princely sum of rs 61,780 on humanitarian grounds even though the company was not legally liable. it took a former lic chairperson to point out the provisions governing 'unconcluded contracts' in the rules manual. policy-holders like ananth krishna and himmatlal bhansali were fortunate that mr krishnamurthy noticed their complaints, published in the 'reader's grievances' columns of the times of india, and took suo motu action by sending letters to the companies concerned. both involved inordinate delays in the payment of settlements on maturity due to near-kafkaesque reasons cited along the lines of 'your docket could not be located'. within weeks, they received their respective cheques in the mail. pensioneer ananth krishna's gratitude comes through in a hand-written thank-you letter addressed to the ombudsman. or take the case of kalpesh and jagruti mehta, who are equally grateful for his intervention. the young couple had to fight a two-and-a-half year battle to get their mediclaim dues from oriental insurance. the point of contention was an exclusion clause and the alleged lack of disclosure of ms mehta's medical condition. within a month of their filing a claim to the ombudsman's office, the dispute was resolved and they received their dues. as mr mehta says, ""the ombudsman has come as a great help to the small policy-holder. after all, not everyone can afford to go to a consumer forum or court, which is already overburdened."" of course, not everyone gets what they want. mr krishnamurthy says instinct and intuition influence his decisions all the time and he has learned to determine when someone is lying or making tall claims -- literally. of the 221 cases that have been filed with the ombudsman in the last year, about 100 were resolved in favour of the claimant and 60-odd in favour of the company. mr krishnamurthy listens to complaints in his 'courtroom', an adjoining conference room, where he calls both parties in separately ""so that they do not start fighting with each other"". an interesting job? unlike most other retired bureaucrats, he is able to smile and answer, ""i feel very satisfied.""

7,Political parties support ban on trucks,"pune: the threat issued by city traders to down shutters notwithstanding, leaders of all political parties represented in the pune municipal corporation (pmc) have given the go-ahead to the civic administration for implementing the 12-hour ban on the entry of trucks on 17 designated roads. the support of party leaders for the ban attains significance as it was owing to their insistence that municipal commissioner t.c. benjamin had to relax it (between 1 p.m. and 4 p.m.) for the last three months. in fact, leaders of all political parties, excluding the republican party of india's (rpi) avinash salve, had written to mr benjamin urging him to relax the ban between june 1 and august 31. the warning issued by the poona merchants' chamber, that they would resort to an agitation and that the pmc would be blamed for non-availability of foodgrains during the festive season, has evoked sharp reactions from the rpi. said mr salve, ""if they do so, we will urge the collector to impose the essential commodities act and force the traders to open their shops. the rpi will stage a mass agitation if the traders resort to such pressure tactics and if the administration succumbs to their pressure."" pune mayor datta gaikwad, who is chairman of the party leaders' co-ordination committee and a congressman, said, ""now there is no going back.we have co-operated with the traders by relaxing the ban for three months, till the dhankawdi truck terminus was being developed. now it is the turn of traders to co-operate with the citizens of pune, by obeying the ban."" deputy mayor and shiv sena leader mahadev babar felt that the traders should realise that the movement of trucks on congested roads posed a serious threat to the safety of students. ""they should agree to the ban. but if they try to oppose it, sena workers will take to the streets, if required, to help the administration in implementing the ban,"" mr babar said. nationalist congress party's pmc unit chief ankush kakde too supported the order, saying, ""the commissioner has given an undertaking in the high court asserting that the ban would be re-imposed from september 1. it is now imperative for us to impose the ban and honour the pmc general body's resolution."" the bjp's civic unit chief sham satpute felt that transporters and truck owners did not have a case now, as their demand for a truck terminus had been accepted. ""the bjp had supported the decision to relax the ban for three months only because the trucks arriving in pune in the day had no place to park their vehicles. now the pmc has developed a truck terminus and hence its move to reinforce the ban should be supported,"" mr satpute said. a group of congress corporators, led by former mayor vandana chavan and ajit apte, had also despatched a memorandum to mr benjamin urging him to impose the ban. meanwhile, the poona merchants' chamber has sent letters to all corporators, requesting them to relax the ban till the pmc constructs an alternative market in bibvewadi for the foodgrain trade. ""the ban on trucks is not a solution to traffic congestion in the peth areas,"" mohan oswal, president of the chamber, said. he pointed out that the ban was strictly for heavy vehicles and excluded light commercial vehicles like big tempos and matadors. ""if we start using these vehicles for unloading goods, they too will cause traffic congestion. the real solution to the problem is shifting of the market,"" mr oswal said. commenting on this argument, a senior civic officer said, ""it is not the pmc's duty to provide alternative land to the traders. and, if it is found that the light commercial vehicles are causing traffic congestion and endangering the safety of students, then we may impose restrictions on their use too.""

8,"Family feud turns violent, one killed","pune: additional sessions judge s.m. shembole on friday sentenced one lahu bhagde (40) of khed to life imprisonment for murdering his cousin, after his father deposed against him. according to the prosecution, one anna bhagde had a dispute with his uncle's family over a piece of land. on july 18, 2000, a quarrel erupted between him and his cousin lahu bhagde (40) after anna tried to collect some soil from the land in dispute. the quarrel soon turned violent and lahu hit anna's head with a shovel lying nearby. although lahu's father, ramchandra, who was informed about the incident by farm workers, rushed his nephew to a nearby hospital, he could not save his life. two of the six witnesses presented by the prosecution turned hostile, but lahu couldn't escape conviction as ramchandra deposed against him.

9,'Party needs violence to sustain itself',"mumbai: last year, sena women corporators, led by former mayor vishakha raut, tried to strip waqarunnisa ansari of the samajwadi party in the brihanmumbai municipal corporation hall during a debate in which ms ansari had made a disparaging remark about the sena chief. ironically, for a party whose avowed aim is to ""develop a strong, upright and cultured youth, aware of responsibilities and duties towards the motherland and society"", violence has never been triggered by bread and butter issues. instead, says bohra reformist and campaigner for secularism asghar ali engineer, the party has capitalised on topical and emotive issues. this has been an easy way out for the sena rather than having to deal with serious issues such as housing and jobs. ""the sena needs one violent agitation after another to sustain itself,"" says mr engineer. ""one of the first acts of the shiv sena after its formation was to set fire to the cpi's office at dalvi building in parel,"" says academic pushpa bhave. at that time, the party was used by the congress as well as capitalists to decimate the left trade unions. ""of course, then, the justification given was that the leftists themselves were no strangers to violent methods,"" says ms bhave. after this communist-bashing phase, the sena targeted south indians by blaming them for taking away jobs from the sons of the soil. and in the eighties, muslims became the target group as the sena hopped onto the hindutva bandwagon. in fact, anand dighe himself was in the forefront of the agitation to rename haji malang, a muslim shrine, in a bid to reassert the sena's majoritarian credentials. ""even during the riots of 1992-'93, the sena claimed that it was protecting the majority community,"" said ms bhave. two years later, the party came to power in the state in alliance with the bjp. ""attacks against minorities are a common tactic of right-wing groups the world over,"" says trade union activist vivek monteiro. ""they may spout populist rhetoric but ultimately these groups are the cat's paw of vested business interests."" decrying the institutionalisation of violence by the sena, architect madhav deshpande, one of the founder members of the sena who drifted away from the party, says, ""it is alright if sainiks assert themselves, but they have forgotten the public cause for which they are supposed to fight. instead, terror has become an end in itself."" according to sociologist sharit bhowmik, sainiks are not trained for a larger role in politics and society as that would inevitably render them unfit to be foot soldiers who would unhesitatingly carry out the biddings of the sena pramukh. it would seem that even in its darkest hour, the sena has fallen back on its familiar tactics—as the recent threat issued by thane mayor ramesh vaity to vijaypat singhania shows.

10,'Sky-bus' gets the nod from govt committees,"pune: residents of pune, mumbai and six other metros in india may soon get over the, bynow-routine, traffic jams and heave a sigh of relief in fresh air, with the konkan railway corporation''s (krc) ambitious sky-bus project finally clearing past the ''main'' hurdle. both, the central committee, headed by the prime minister''s scientific advisor, a.p.j. abdul kalam, and the state committee, headed by chairman of the atomic energy commission anil kakodkar have cleared the project, saying it was ""technically feasible and safe"". speaking to the times of india, b. rajaram, managing director of krc, said with clearance from both the committees, the initial apprehensions about feasibility of the project had been laid to rest. the project, aimed at revolutionising public transport in metros, was till date progressing at a snail''s pace because of doubts about its technology and safety. but the go-ahead from the two committees is expected to provide it the requisite momentum. mr rajaram said the committees, which also included senior officers from the department of railway safety, thoroughly examined the technical feasibility and safety aspects of the project to state it was ""safe"". the krc had two months ago made a presentation before the pune municipal corporation (pmc), after which corporators and the pmc officials welcomed the project, but requested the civic chief to put it on hold till the state committee certified it. municipal commissioner t.c. benjamin had said that the project would be executed only after successful conducting of ""field tests"" at a pilot project on the andheri-ghatkopar link in mumbai. pmc''s traffic planner, b. shriniwas, said he would soon hold talks with the mumbai metropolitan regional development authority to ascertain when the pilot project would be undertaken. about launch of the pilot project, mr rajaram said, ""we have the technical know-how and are ready. the state has to provide funds and the right to way."" he, however, clarified that the krc would not invest in the main project, estimated to cost over rs 25,000 crore if implemented in eight metros, as well as in the pilot project. he was confident that several companies would approach the krc for executing the project, once the state government and municipal corporations gave it the right to way and allowed the companies to earn profits via ticket-sale and advertising. ""these companies would give money for the project, while the krc''s role would be to provide technical assistance and supervise its execution,"" mr rajaram said. according to d.g. divte,krc''s technical director, the project, based on the ''sky wheels'' presentation at the world congress of railway research, 1989, involved the proven rail-guided bogie system. the only difference being that the sky-buses (light-weight coaches) would be in a suspended position and would run below rail guides, as in a rope-way. according to the project proposal, eight-metre-high pillars, on whom box girders would rest, would be installed along the centre (on dividers) of the existing roads, 15 metres apart from each other.

11,"The heart rules, not the head","mumbai: whether or not the shiv sena's version of the events that unfolded at singhania hospital last sunday will wash with thane's electorate will only be known at the next civic elections. however, this is not the first time that the 35-year-old party has attributed violence by its cadres to an ""emotional outpouring"". neither is this the first time that the party has resorted to such tactics. when ghulam ali sang in mumbai, the show was disrupted. when fire was screened here, the cinema hall was stoned. whenever the indian cricket authorities want test matches with pakistan, sainiks have dug up pitches and ransacked the cricket board's office. if schools deny admission to locals, their principals are roughed up. not only is the violence resorted to by the rank and file, even elected representatives of the party have not been above such tactics. last year, 13 sena mlas were suspended for six months after they ran amuck in the state assembly, smashing furniture and tearing up law books. this was their way of responding to the proposal by deputy chief minister chhagan bhujbal that mr thackeray be arrested for his writings in the sena mouthpiece saamna during the 1992-'93 riots.

12,Most suicides due to illness,"hyderabad: illness drives the largest number of people to suicide in andhra pradesh, when compared to other states. according to a report published by the national crime records bureau, andhra pradesh accounts for the highest proportion suicides (39.9 per cent) in which illness or physical pain is the reason for the person committing suicide. the report - accidental deaths and suicides in india, based on cases in 1998 - puts pondicherry a close second with 38.3 per cent and karnataka comes third with 30.7 per cent of suicides resorted to due to illnesses. according to the report, of the 9,433 people who committed suicide in the state in 1998, at least 3,773 ended their lives due to illnesses. cancer, aids, paralysis and mental illness are mentioned as the main causes. a total of 1,04,713 people committed suicide in the country that year, including 22,071 due to illnesses. in hyderabad, at least one suicide due to illness occurs every third day. last week, there were three cases. a 25-year-old postgraduate student committed suicide as he was reportedly suffering from cancer. in another case, a 19-year-old student ended her life unable to bear the pain of a disease. last month at least 10 people committed suicide because of this motive. eminent psychiatrist, dr prabhakar korada says when pain suffered by an ill person becomes unbearable, he or she might recourse to suicide. dr korada said, at least 50 per cent of his patients in hyderabad, who come to be counselled on suicides, think of it due to illness or pain. ""the pain that a person has to suffer when he is struck by a disease can also make him very depressed as he feels no one can help him escape it,"" dr korada says. although such people need psychiatric treatment, they are rarely sent for counselling, he added. dr korada says mania, a psychiatric problem, is a major cause for suicides.a person suffering from mania becomes hyperactive for a certain period of time and then gets depressed and might think of suicide.

13,Committee seeks revival of HPFL before disinvestment,"new delhi: a parliamentary committee has asked the government to immediately begin revival of ailing hindustan photo films mfg ltd before divesting 74 per cent equity in the psu in favour of potential joint venture partners. ""the revival proposal of hpfl pending before the union cabinet should be cleared with immediate effect for enabling the company to turn around,"" the committee on public undertakings headed by vijay kumar malhotra said in its report. ""the revival of this company is all the more urgently required as this alone would infuse confidence in potential joint venture partners who would step in with appropriate modern technology and funds to make the company grow and prosper,"" malhotra said while referring to the proposed disinvestment of 74 per cent government equity in favour of a joint venture partner. according to provisional figures for 2000-01, hpfl's net loss increased by more than 21 per cent to rs 337.08 crore against rs 278.44 crore in the previous fiscal. the psu has been posting continuous losses since 1992-93 till date. terming the present status of this company as `pathetic', malhotra said in the report that hpfl was ""on the brink of being closed down"". to its surprise, the committee noted that no investment has been made by the government in integrated manufacturing in the last 50 years"". the committee identified three major factors for declining sales performance during '90s and they were non-completion of polyester x-ray plant, non-availability of working capital and competition from mncs. hpfl's continued losses since 1992-93 were mainly due to lower capacity utilisation and non-availability of adequate working capital and severe competition from mnc players. ""the company needs to reorient the existing sales strategy to cope with the changing scenario,"" it said. high level of interest burden, depreciation and overhead costs also contributed towards the losses. the interest portion stood at rs 271.32 crores accounting for 80.5 per cent in rs 337.08 crore net loss in 2000-01. on the sales front, the company's provisional turnover for 2000-01 stood at rs 25.66 crore against rs 31.98 crore target. noting that hpfl was hit hard by the government's decision of import delicensing, the committee said reduction of customs duty for finished and semi-finished photo goods below wto rates worsened the financial health of hpfl. in order to support hpfl, the committee asked the government to impose both tariff and non-tariff barriers so that goods manufactured by hpf do not suffer for mncs' unethical practices. it favoured adaptation of strong actions as prevailing in france and china against photo goods, imported through unfair practice including dumping. moreover, government should take expeditious action to designate a single port in the country for imports of all unexposed photographic products, it said. the government policy should be re-oriented towards encouraging foreign companies for setting up manufacturing facilities instead of making the country a place for post production activities, it said. in china, the government pumped 550 million dollar in developing indigenous manufacturing facility and introduced protective measures. this resulted in making country's main photographic manufacturing company, china lucky films company, into a profit-making company.

""during my meeting with sinha yesterday, the finance minister told me that he has also gone through this (kind of) trauma in the hawala case so he understands. he said he will ensure that no injustice is done,"" singh quoted the finance minister as telling him. singh said in an interview on sunday that he had explained in details the alleged payoffs case to the finance minister and cited the lokayukta's opinion that an unsigned note which apparently lists names of politicians and alleged payoffs was not a legal document and no action could be taken on this issue. the madhya pradesh chief minister complained to sinha that ""selective leaking"" of information by income tax department was against service conduct rules and they tried to politicise it. when the lokayukta sought information, the income tax officials gave information only about people belonging to a particular political party. but when the lokayukta sent his own officials, he found the names of people of other parties as well. ""this proves that either on its own it wanted to politicise the matter or was working at the instance of some politician,"" he said. asked if he suspected the opposition behind the issue or someone from within his congress party, singh said ""i think from the opposition"", but on the same question later, he said ""i can't say... may be, it may not be"".

17,Chances of finding ET life increasing: Expert,"bangalore: there will be direct evidence of extra-terrestrial (et) life within the next 15 years although huge investments might be required for the research, a leading us scientist has said. prof steven beckwith, director american space telescope science institute, said america's premier space agency nasa was headed in the ""right direction"" in attempting to establish direct evidence of any existence of et life. ""at present, we do not have any evidence whatsoever, to determine whether there is et life, but we can have a technology regime capable of establishing direct evidence to that effect in the next 10 to 15 years,"" beckwith said while addressing a talk organised by the indian academy of sciences on ""hubble telescope: it's impact on our understanding of the universe"", here on friday. several in-depth observations over the recent past years using the hubble space telescope had yielded evidence that there were many more planetary systems than what was earlier thought, he said. studies had shown that stars in their formative stages developed a disc around them which shut out much of their light, he said, adding ""there is every likelihood that these discs rotating around the stars are gas and dust which on cooling might develop into planetary systems"". with every planetary system detected, the chances of possible et life went up on the factor scale, beckwith said. with every advance in the sophistication of observation equipment right from galileo's days, the observable limit of the universe was expanding, and so the technology applied towards it, beckwith said . the hubble space telescope, considered as one of the most advanced equipments, which has yielded astronomers with many discoveries in the recent times, would be upgraded with more sophisticated systems onboard, he said however, it would also be improved further with the present nasa project of developing the next generation space telescope which is expected to replace the hubble space telescope when its retires towards the end of this decade, he said. the partners in this project were the canadian space agency, european space agency, lockheed martin and trw/ball aerospace. the present challenge posed to astronomers was to unravel the mysteries of the expanding universe and whether it was actually accelerating or slowing down, beckwith said. ""only one supernova till date had shown signs of accelerating away from the centre of the universe after the big bang millions of years back, while most of the supernovae were decelerating,"" he added.",bangalore

27,"SC, law cannot root out corruption","new delhi: the other day, law minister arun jaitley had a dig at some parliamentarians who wanted that the government to give a fresh look at the provision which debars a convicted person from contesting elections. though convicted tamil nadu chief minister j jayalalithaa's name did not figure in the discussions, jaitley wondered why the lawmakers who had been demanding that even chargesheeted persons (ayodhya case) like advani and uma bharti should be debarred from contesting any election, were now in favour of convicted persons entering the legislative house. the concern for keeping criminals out of the high chambers of law-making bodies is often heard. there is also unanimity on the view that criminalisation of politics has eaten away the vitals of parliamentary form of democracy. the election commission and law commission have recommended a ban on the entry of chargesheeted persons in the law-making houses. however, some damage to democracy was wrought when the supreme court said taking of bribe by an mp or mps for acting in a particular way in the legislative body was not an offence as the mps and mlas enjoyed immunity from any criminal action for their actions in the house. the then tamil nadu governor m fathima beevi's decision to invite convicted aiadmk leader j jayalalithaa, whose nomination papers had been rejected for she was sentenced in a corruption case, also hit the ailing democracy. be that as it may, the supreme court has already dealt with the misuse of article 164 (4) of the constitution which allows any non-elected person to become the prime minister, a chief minister or a minister for six months during which he or she is expected to get elected to either of the two houses. when the court's attention was drawn towards jayalalithaa's case the cm was disqualified to contest election and thus could not enter the law-making body even after six months, the court had reserved its comment, saying it was concerned with the sole issue of misuse of article 164 (4). ``corruption by public servants has now reached a monstrous dimension....its tentacles have started grappling even the institutions created for the protection of the republic....the corrupt servants (including mps and mlas) could even paralyse the functioning of such institutions and thereby hinder the democratic polity'', so said the bench of justice k t thomas and justice s n variava while dealing with a convicted punjab bureaucrat k c sareen's petition wanting restoration in the job till his appeal was decided by the higher court. as many as 91 cases relating to prevention of corruption act are pending in the supreme court. in its judgment, the court had recommended the reintroduction of repealed sections 61 and 62 of the indian penal code so as to create a deterrent effect on those who are bent upon accumulating wealth at the cost of the society by misusing their post and power. the core question, however, remains to be answered. should the judiciary, which feels handicapped for want of appropriate amendments in law, become an instrument in facilitating a corrupt public servant to remain in power. perhaps, not.
