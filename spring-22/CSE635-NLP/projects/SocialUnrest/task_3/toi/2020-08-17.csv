0,Pregnant woman set afire by in-laws,"HYDERABAD: A pregnant woman was allegedly set on fire by her in-laws on Sunday afternoon. The woman, who suffered more than 55 per cent burns, is undergoing treatment at the Osmania General Hospital.

Naveeda Khatoon, 20, was admitted to the hospital by her neighbours after she suffered burns at around 2 pm. Her father Saber Ali Khan alleged that Naveeda was set on fire by her in-laws, while her husband Ahmed Ali Khan looked on, a charge denied by the latter. Saber said he gave Rs 50,000 cash and gold jewellery besides other household articles to Ahmed towards dowry.

But soon after the marriage, Naveeda had been tortured by her husband and in-laws for money, he alleged. However, Ahmed said that there were no differences at all with his wife and he doesnâ€™t know why she â€œattempted suicide.â€�

1,VHP to increase activities in state,"PATNA: Despite two of its senior leaders having been prohibited from entering Bihar, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) seems to be increasing its activities in the state.

According to the organisationâ€™s state spokesman Shivdutt Mishra, kendriya mantri (central secretary) of the VHP Jeeweshwar Mishra arrived at Munger on Sunday. â€œHe along with Mahant Ghanshyam Das and Gopesh Muni will visit around 500 villages in 12 blocks of the area and hold â€˜sankalp sutraâ€™ ceremonies in all these villages,â€� Shivdutt said, adding that the three would be accompanied by 50 VHP workers.

He said Jeeweshwar Mishra, Mahant Ghanshyam Das and Gopesh Muni reached Munger by train. â€œEvery visit by VHP leaders will not be a high-profile one, unlike on two previous occasions,â€� he maintained, adding that the VHP is not deterred by the refusal of the Bihar government to allow its leaders Praveen Togadia and Acharya Giriraj Kishore to enter Bihar. â€œWe will increase our activities in Bihar. It will now become a centre of our activities,â€� he remarked.

Shivdutt said the state governmentâ€™s steps would be challenged in court as an assault on the fundamental right of an Indian citizen to move around the country. A delegation of the VHP met governor M Rama Jois to protest against the state governmentâ€™s steps. The governor assured the delegation that he would look into the matter, he maintained.

The BJP has dubbed the state governmentâ€™s decision to prohibit the entry of VHP leaders into Bihar as not only an encroachment on the democratic rights but also sheer dictatorship. The party alleged that RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav wants to create social and communal tension by making such moves.

The BJP said while Laloo called the controversial Siwan MP Mohammad Shahabuddin his younger brother, the leaders of a â€œnationalist organisationâ€� were insulted in Bihar. The party demanded an apology from Laloo and chief minister Rabri Devi.

2,"'Trapped' by financier, painter commits suicide","ABOHAR: Caught in a vicious debt trap, Subash, a painter, committed suicide after accusing the financier of tormenting him of paying an amount more than what he had borrowed.

Subash had taken a loan of Rs 5,000 from a private finance company and had to return the money in 100 instalments of Rs 50 each for 100 days without a break. In case of default, he had to pay a fine of Rs 20 on each instalment.

With a meagre earning of Rs 60 to Rs 70 a day, it was near impossible for him to meet the loan term. As the fine continued to soar, Subash was ensnared in a vicious debt trap which swelled to an amount more than Rs 40,000 in a span of two years.

Subash had already paid Rs 30,000 to the owner of Deep Finance Company at Abohar before he committed suicide on Saturday here. Rakesh Agarwal, assistant superintendent of police (ASP), Abohar, said that in a suicide note found from Subash''s pocket it was alleged that he had borrowed Rs 5,000 and had returned Rs 30,000 but still the financier was tormenting him for more amount.

Subash''s family members alleged that on Saturday he was picked up from his house by Akashdeep, the owner of the finance company, and his accomplice Prithvi Raj, and was tortured for not returning the amount.

Though the Abohar police have registered a criminal case against the accused for kidnapping and abetment of suicide, the incident has stirred a controversy as police have failed to arrest them as they are kin of police officials. Father of Akashdeep is head of wireless operators at Muktsar and Nachhatar Singh,who is also a head wireless operator in Abohar, is a partner in the finance company. Nachhatar Singh had been transferred on Saturday evening.

Subash''s suicide has brought the role of finance companies fleecing poor persons under the scanner. With most of the poor persons unable to pay the loan along with the interest, they end up in jails and have been awarded sentences for the crime of dishonouring a cheque.

""Though it is surprising that a poor person would have a bank account, money lenders have got bank accounts opened in their names and taken signatures on blank cheques from the borrowers,"" said sources.

Most of the finance companies have direct or indirect support of the area police. While in certain cases some retired policemen are running them, thus exploiting their links to recover money, in other cases they are silent partners, said sources.

Abohar ASP said that he was consulting Reserve Bank of India (RBI) authorities in Chandigarh to check the unregulated growth of these companies which have only one motive of trapping the poor and fleecing them.

3,UP govt begins parallel probe,"LUCKNOW: Even as the Central Bureau of Investigation is conducting a probe into Taj Heritage Corridor case, the Uttar Pradesh government has initiated another enquiry into the case and served a notice on suspended environment secretary R K Sharma.

A 10-page notice of departmental enquiry was pasted outside the Dalibagh residence of Sharma last night. Sharma has been asked to submit his reply within 15 days.

In the notice, the government held Sharma responsible for initiating the Rs 175-crore Taj Heritage Corridor project and misleading the mission management board, which had cleared the project.

A security guard, Ramesh Sahu, posted outside the residence of Sharma said that a few people had came and asked for sahib (Sharma) on Saturday night. ""When I told them that sahib is in Delhi, they pasted a notice outside the closed door,"" he said.

This would be the second enquiry initiated by the state government in the case. Earlier, finance secretary Naveen Chandra Vajpayee had conducted the probe and the report had been submitted to the state government.

The report, however, has not been made public.

The CBI has already questioned Sharma, in which he had reportedly blamed chief secretary of the state, D S Bagga, for initiating the project. The CBI had submitted an interim report in the matter to the Supreme court last week.

4,Badal inducts Tohra men in party set-up,"CHANDIGARH: President of the Shiromani Akali Dal Parkash singh Badal on Monday announced to expand the party''s organisational structure and induct nine more members in order to accomodate the Tohra group with which he joined hands in July.

After making Gurcharan Singh Tohra saddle in the office of the president of the Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandak Committee, the announcement of new officer-bearers marks complete merger of the two groups which had split in 1999.

Besides SGPC president Gurcharan Singh Tohra three other members to be inducted to the political affairs committee of the party would be Manjit Singh Calcutta, Prem Singh Lalpura and Harmel Singh Tohra.

In a statement Daljit Singh Cheema, press secretary of the SAD, said that vetran Akali leader Jathedar Surjan Singh Thekedar has been nominated patron of the party while Bhai Manjit Singh will be senior vice-president.

The party will also have two new general secretaries in Mahesh Inder Singh Grewal and Prem Singh Chandumajra while Rajbir Singh Padiala has been included as junior vice-president.

5,"Govt may allow banks, FIs in commodity market","NEW DELHI: Finance ministry is considering a proposal for allowing banks and financial institutions to trade in commodities markets.

""Presentations have been made by market intermediaries to RBI and the finance ministry for allowing banks and FIs to trade in commodities market. The government is considering the proposals,"" official sources said here.

Banks can take a maximum exposure of 5.0 per cent of their advances in equities market. Although they are also allowed to import and sell gold, banks are not yet allowed to invest in commodities market as such.

There was also a proposal with the government in allowing foreign institutional investors (FIIs) registered with the Reserve Bank of India to take part in commodities trade, they said.

Some of the FIIs are very active in commodities markets abroad and are eyeing the Indian markets as well.

At present, banks, FIs and FIIs can invest in only equity and debt markets. While equity and debt constitute major chunk of their portfolios, commodities are also being eyed in the wake of sharp movements in prices of gold in recent times.

The move to involve banks, FIs and FIIs in commodities market can be seen in the light of international experience where institutional investors play a lead role in price determination of many items, including gold and silver.

The commodities market in developed nations was three times bigger than the equities market, sources said, adding this was bound to happen in India as well considering the huge agrarian market.

7,Pak may grant India MFN to clinch SAFTA,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan may grant the Most Favoured Nation status to India before the South Asia Free Trade Area Treaty talks in Kathmandu in October in order to clinch the Treaty.

According to Pakistani officialis, the SAFTA talks -- earlier to be held in September -- have been rescheduled for October.

However, a second round of talks may follow in November before the treaty is signed by both countries, according to a report in a daily.

Asked whether it would mean Pakistan giving India MFN status, the officials said: ""It would mean Most Favoured Nation status plus many other things for India."" ""Eventually, the treaty will incorporate binding time-frames for freeing trade,"" they said.

The daily pointed out that Pakistan''s top diplomats supported trade with India at a foreign envoys conference in Islamabad. ""We will set modalities for trade with India when SAFTA talks are held,"" Foreign Secretary Riaz Khokhar said at the Foreign Secretaries conference in Kathmandu recently.

India has made it clear that successful SAFTA process is essential for the progress of the SAARC movement and virtually linked finalisation of SAFTA to the holding of SAARC summit in Islamabad.

The Foreign Secretaries meeting has finalised the schedule for SAARC summit to be held in Islamabad early next year and the SAFTA was expected to be ready before that.

8,"Vajpayee govt's days are numbered, says Sonia","NEW DELHI: In a scathing attack on the Vajpayee government, Congress President Sonia Gandhi on Monday said its days were numbered as its rule was marred by all-round failure, jeopardising country''s defence, denigrating key institutions of parliamentary democracy and mounting corruption.

Gandhi, who moved a no-confidence motion in Lok Sabha against the Vajpayee Government, dubbed the NDA as ""incompetent, insensitive, irresponsible and brazenly corrupt"" during her one-hour speech.

Facing frequent interruptions and tongue-in-cheek remarks from the Treasury benches in a packed House, Gandhi held the Government squarely responsible for ""blatantly undermining the independence of our foreign policy"".

She asked the Prime Minister why his government was ""impeding"" the functioning of the PAC by refusing to give it access to the CVC report ""which has examined some transactions relating to Operation Vijay"".

Initiating the no-confidence debate against the Vajpayee government, Sonia Gandhi said the motion was ""born of a real concern for the direction our country is taking"".

The Congress President said there was ""an arrogance of government"" that ""is a danger to the basic tenet of our constitution, a danger to freedom"".

The lower house of Parliament erupted immediately with a governing coalition member objecting to Gandhi reading her statement. After several minutes of shouting, the speaker allowed her to continue.

""I charge this government with jeopardizing the country''s defense, weakening national security, willfully creating social disharmony, distorting the education system ... blatantly undermining the independence of our foreign policy,"" Gandhi said.

Gandhi, who is also leader of the Opposition, made it clear at the outset that she was not proposing the motion for ""partisan reasons because parties are not important, nor are numbers of any consequence"".

She was apparently referring to the outcome of the no-confidence motion being a foregone conclusion since the NDA was way ahead in the numbers game.

""Our indictment is comprehensive, just as their failures are complete,"" the Congress President said adding the no-trust motion was borne out of a ""genuine disquiet over the capricious way in which this Government is conducting the business of governance.""

""There is an inherent danger in this kind of arrogant governance. It is a danger to basic tenets of Constitution.""

In an obvious attack on Defence Minister George Fernandes, who is in the eye of the storm over the PAC-CVC issue, Gandhi said there was ""obviously something terribly wrong with our defence"".

She dubbed as an ""inexcusable lapse"" an amount of Rs 24,000 crore allocated for defence modernisation remaining unspent which was around 30 per cent of budgeted amount.

Gandhi made occasional jibes at Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani and other Ministers including Sushma Swaraj.

She said Advani had promised a White Paper on ISI activities in India but four years later nothing was heard.

Tracing various controversies and scams that surfaced during the four-year rule of the Vajpayee government, Gandhi sought to embarrass it on the Gujarat riots, Taj corridor scandal, stock market and UTI scams and ""systematic attempts to derail the inquiry"" into the Tehelka expose.

Gandhi quoted from the Subramanyam Committee Report that the Kargil intrusion had come as a complete and total surprise to the Indian Government, army and intelligence agencies as well as to the Jammu and Kashmir Government and its agencies and said the demand for discussion on the Report had fallen on deaf ears.

""That the lessons of Kargil have not been learnt is evident from the outrage of Hill Kaka near Jammu. Not only this, several hundred terrorists had a clear run over a large area for an astonishing length of time.""

She said thanks to the CAG, the country now knows how this government permitted corruption in the purchase of coffins meant for Kargil martyrs.

""Pehle, aap ne khub sarp ko ghusne diya, phir vinash ki sochi (first, you allowed the snake to enter, then you thought of destroying it),"" she said in apparent reference to the Operation Sarpavinash.

Gandhi accused the NDA of ""playing with fire"" in the northeast and said elections in Nagaland were held ""under threats to the people"".

Referring to Arunachal Pradesh, she said efforts to topple democratically-elected governments were being systematically made. ""The recent changes in Arunachal politics have been mainly possible because of hectic backdoor support of the BJP leaders.""

Taking a dig at the BJP-led coalition on the women''s reservation issue, Gandhi said it was now more than clear that the Government has no intention whatsoever in getting the bill passed.

""If it had, it could have done so with our support any day. A government that wilfully destroys national consensus in every other area suddenly discovers the virtues of a consensus on this issue. This is simply a pretext for inaction. All of us women know it. Sushmaji don''t you agree?""

Gandhi''s remark caused laughter in the House and the Parliamentary Affairs Minister putting the ball in the Opposition court said opponents of the bill-- Laloo Prasad Yadav and Mulayam Singh Yadav-- were on the other side.

Recalling Government''s claim of a ""paradigm shift"" in bilateral ties with the US, she said if indeed there has been such a shift then no benefits seemed to have accrued to India.

She asked the Prime Minister to spell out India''s stand on the presence of NATO forces in Afghanistan saying it was an unprecedented development and had profound significance.

9,India to raise development issues at WTO,"NEW DELHI: India on Monday demanded that development concerns should be brought to the centrestage of the negotiations in the World Trade Organisation both in the run-up to the Cancun meeting of the trade ministers as well as at Cancun itself.

Commerce and industry minister Arun Jaitley, who will lead the Indian delegation in the September 10-14 conference in Cancun, told a national symposium on WTO issues that if a positive outcome is to be achieved in Cancun, it will be imperative that the development concerns are brought to the fore.

Hitting out at the developed nations for their attitudes towards WTO negotiations, Jaitley said there were attempts to push ahead with items of interest to developed nations and go slow on areas of concerns to developing countries.

""The phase of progress on development and implementations issues is significantly slower,"" Jaitley said asserting that India and several developing countries want that these be brought to centrestage as ""we move on road to Cancun"".

Stressing trade reforms were easier in European Union and United States which have ""experienced fruits of development"", Jaitley said in vibrant democracies, like India, reforms become more complicated as they have not yet fully seen the fruits of development.

On agriculture, he said India and other developing countries will press for phased elimination of farm subsidies which rendered farmers from the poor countries uncompetitive in the global market.

As many as 650 million people in India depend on agriculture and hence ""our concerns have social and economic consequences"".

On WTO''s patent regime and public helath, Jaitley said India hopes a solution would be found at Cancun and it was precisely for this reason India had broadly agreed to the December draft despite having certain reservations.

""We are close to a solution and we hope the issue would be put to sleep at Cancun,"" he said.

On lowering of industrial tariffs, Jaitley said India does not expect significant movement forward at Cancun in the light of the proposal made jointly by the US, Canada and European Union, which is loaded against the interest of developing countries.

Elaborating on four Singapore issues comprising Trade and Investment, Competition, Trade facilitation and trasparency in government procurement, Jaitley said the consequences have not yet been fully analysed.

It will, therefore, not be possible to reach an explicit consensus in Cancun on a mandate to WTO to negotiate a multilateral investment agreement.

10,Bypolls to two LS seats on Sept 26,"NEW DELHI: Bye-elections to Ernakulam (Kerala) and Solapur (Maharashtra) Lok Sabha constituencies would be held on September 26, the Election Commission announced on Monday.

Along with these two parliamentary seats, bye-elections would also be held for six Assembly seats in five states, an EC release said.

While bye-elections to Ernakulam seat was necessitated following the death of sitting Congress member George Eden, the need for election to Solapur arose in view of Sushil Kumar Shinde (Congress) giving up the seat on becoming chief minister of Maharashtra.

The assembly constituencies where polling would be held are Karwan (AP), Vemagal and Hungud (both Karnataka), Laban (Meghalaya), Birmaharajpur (Orissa) and Uttarpara (West Bengal).

The notifications would be issued on September 1. While the last date for filing nominations would be September 8, scrutiny would take place the following day and the last date for the withdrawal of candidatures is on September 11. The poll process would be completed by October 6, the EC said.

The Commission has decided to use Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) in the bye-elections, the press note said adding compulsory identification of voters would be made in the polling.

The model code of conduct would come into effect immediately and it would be applicable to the whole district or districts in which part of parliamentary constituency or any other assembly constituency going for bye-elections was included. This would be applicable to all political parties and to the state and Union governments, EC added.

11,Kisan Sangh drops 'Maha-Kumbh' against Gujarat govt,"GANDHINAGAR: Failing to get enough strength for its recent agitations, the Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS) has announced its decision to withdraw its state-wide rally against the Gujarat government, planned for August 25.

Called ''Maha-Kumbh'', the rally was to take place in the state capital as the first major agitation of the BKS, a Sangh Parivar body, against the 2.5 times hike in unmerited power hike for farmers. A BKS note issued at the end of its Sunday executive said, instead, the rally will take place a month later.

As against the planned rally, on August 25 the BKS will hold an agitation at Kandla on the adverse impact of World Trade Organisation (WTO) conditionalities on farm produce. In BKS scheme of things, it is more pertinent to make farmers aware of why the cost of farm production, already so high, may even go higher. It would also help the BKS convince the government why the farmers need a higher subsidy, argue its office-bearers.

The decision for calling off the agitation, taken the day Chief Minister Narendra Modi flew to London, could not be ascertained. No BKS leader was available in the office for comment. But well-placed Sachivalaya sources said, the CM-formed four-person ministerial committee to ''help farmers'' and provide them with relief held its first round of meeting last weekend. It discussed various options, including a package for the farmers.

Consisting of agriculture minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasma, revenue minister Kaushik Patel, energy minister Saurabh Patel and industries minister Anil Patel, results of the meeting are believed to have been informally conveyed to the BKS. ""We will come up with a compromise formula. The CM has already announced that nothing would be done to harm the farmers'' interests"", the energy minister told TNN here on Monday.

Elated by the failure of BKS farmers to mop up enough strength against the tariff hike, the minister, outrightly rejected BKS, Kisan Congress and other farmers'' bodies'' demand to withdraw the hike -- from Rs 500 per horse power (HP) per year to Rs 1,260 -- completely.

Refusing to spell out the compromise formula, the minister indicated, things would be made known early next week, when the next round of negotiations with the farmers'' bodies will begin. The compromise formula is likely to depend on the amount the state coffers could spare as subsidy against cheaper power to the farmers. The hike may be slashed by Rs 300 to Rs 400. The government may also announce a crop insurance scheme to the tune of Rs 350 crore, Sachivalaya sources said.

Meanwhile, it is reliably learnt that the five North Gujarat district office-bearers of the BKS have dissented against the current BKS leadership at the body''s executive meet. The office-bearers refused to buy the argument of the organisation''s president Prafull Senjalia and general secretary Maganlal Patel that still farmers were ''not angry enough'' against the power tariff hike, hence the rally on August 25 had no meaning.

12,Delimitation not possible before polls: Jaitley,"NEW DELHI: The government said on Monday that as per present indications, the delimitation process may not be completed in all the states in time for the next general elections.

In a written reply to the Rajya Sabha, Law Minister Arun Jaitley cited the delay in the final census figures for 2001 as the reason for this. The delimitation work is to be carried out on the basis of the 2001 census figures and that the Delimitation Commission had informed the government that the final figures were expected to be published only in October 2003.

Jaitley said the Delimitation Commission had also informed the government that the Election Commission would also take about four to six months for collation of electoral rolls in terms of the newly delimited constituencies, revision of lists of polling stations and appointment of electoral registration officers.

However, Jaitley added that the Delimitation Commission had stated that it would endeavour to complete the work as expeditiously as possible.

13,Put development at core of WTO: India,"NEW DELHI: India on Monday demanded that development concerns should be brought to the centrestage of the negotiations in the World Trade Organisation (WTO) both in the run-up to the Cancun meeting of the trade ministers as well as at Cancun itself.

Commerce and Industry Minister Arun Jaitley, who will lead the Indian delegation in the September 10-14 conference in Cancun, told a national symposium on WTO issues that if a positive outcome is to be achieved in Cancun, it will be imperative that the development concerns are brought to the fore.

UN Conference on Trade Development (UNCTAD) director Lakshmi Puri suggested that developing countries, including India, should prepare for the accelerated negotiation process which are now going on in Geneva in the run-up to Cancun. The elements of strategic calculus for negotiations should, therefore, include knowing about capacities in each sector and framing suitable medium or long-term plans up to 2015 and calibration of domestic concerns with multilateral trade liberalisation.

Hitting out at the developed nations for their attitude towards the WTO negotiations, Jaitley said there were attempts to push ahead with items of interest to developed nations and go slow on areas of concerns to developing countries.

""The phase of progress on development and implementation issues is significantly slower,"" Jaitley said asserting that India and several developing countries want these to be brought to the centrestage as ""we move on road to Cancun"".

Stressing that trade reforms were easier in the European Union and the United States which have ""experienced fruits of development"", Jaitley said that in vibrant democracies, like India, reforms become more complicated as they have not yet fully seen the fruits of development.

On agriculture, he said India and the other developing countries will press for phased elimination of farm subsidies which rendered farmers from the poor countries uncompetitive in the global market. As many as 650 million people in India depend on agriculture and hence ""our concerns have social and economic consequences"".

""We are close to a solution and we hope the issue would be put to sleep at Cancun,"" he said.

On lowering of industrial tariffs, Jaitley said India does not expect significant movement forward in the light of the proposal made jointly by the US, Canada and the European Union, which is loaded against the interest of developing countries.

14,Swadeshi outfits want government out of WTO,"NEW DELHI: The Swadeshi Jagran Manch (SJM) and allied organisations have decided to hold a ""mahadharna"" at Ajmeri Gate in Delhi on September 2 asking the government to get out of the WTO.

""Our demand is that the government should get out of the WTO. The impact of the country''s compliance with WTO policies is visible on farmers and jobless youth. We will hold a mahadharna to make the government see reason,"" says Virendra Singh, SJM convener for Uttar Pradesh.

Though SJM is the organiser, the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS) and the Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS) will also participate in the `Quit WTO'' dharna, to be addressed by their founder and veteran RSS leader Dattopant Thengadi. But all this seems to be more for public consumption than influencing government policy.

Behind the scenes, the leaders of all three organisations, which are ""fighting"" the government over WTO, have been holding consultations with the government and have given their suggestions and received ""assurances"" from commerce minister Arun Jaitley on the Cancun WTO conference to be held next month.

BMS resident secretary R K Bhakt said the BMS and BKS representatives had met Jaitley almost six weeks ago and sought an aggressive line on subsidies in the agriculture sector. ""Our relationship with the political leadership would depend on the government''s stand in Cancum,"" said SJM national convener Muralidhar Rao. The SJM is yet to meet the minister, said Rao.

According to sources, the organisations appeared to be more pragmatic in private discussions than in public rallies. Apparently the Sangh outfits are satisfied with the outcome of their talks with the government.

Asked whether the Sangh affiliates have met him to discuss the Cancun WTO conference, Jaitley told The Times of India that ""leaders from BMS, BKS and SJM have been meeting me separately"".

The large left-of-centre political space on economic issues has always been the RSS'' greatest challenge and the Sangh had done its best to make inroads into this space. Thengadi''s public protest against foreign investment in the insurance sector in 1998 was projected as the reason for the government''s decision to scale down FDI in this sector.

Similarly, in 1999, there was another rally again asking the government to quit WTO. In early 2001, at a huge BMS rally, Thengadi called the then finance minister Yashwant Sinha a ""criminal"". And a two-month nation wide yatra against WTO, that ended on June 14, was flagged off by Thengadi.

15,Govt to relook laws on remixes,"NEW DELHI: I&B minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Monday said that a core group has been set up to consider amendments to the Copyright Act relating to the music remixes of old songs. Prasad said that there is no unanimity in the music industry on this issue.

The Indian music industry is estimated to lose around Rs 200 crore because of the remixing and release of the old songs. To compound matters, leading music firms have joined the remix bandwagon. Companies like Sony, Saregama, Virgin among others have entered this segment. The existing copyright law allows companies to release remixes of any song that is more than two years old.

The only requirement: the parent record company had to be informed. The law enables remixes of old songs to be released at a payment of 5 per cent royalty for every CD or tape sold. â€˜â€˜This law has to be amended to allow fair play in the market,â€™â€™ said Savio Dezouza, secretary general Indian Music Industry.
