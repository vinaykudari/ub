0,HC indicts minister for shielding liquor firms,"NAGPUR: The Nagpur bench of the Bombay high court has indicted state excise minister Anil Deshmukh for stalling departmental action against two liquor factories owned by Ulhasnagar MLA Suresh alias Pappu Kalani and his wife Jyoti Kalani for duty evasion.

Pappu Kalani and Deshmukh both belong to the NCP, which is a partner in the ruling DF government.

Jyoti is mayor of Ulhasnagar. Significantly, while the action of the DF minister came in for criticism, the court did not spare Prakash Mehta, former excise minister in the earlier Shiv Sena-BJP government, for waiving excise dues of Rs 5.41 crore owed by another company, Konkan Agro Marine belonging to Nagpur-based liquor baron Devilal Jaiswal, in 1999.

Deshmukh, who is vacationing in the US, told TNN that the judgment did not constitute a stricture against him. He said that no revenue loss had been caused to the government.

Passing its order on Wednesday, the court asked chief minister Sushilkumar Shinde to take up both matters and see to it that liqour barons as well as the high and mighty did not get away scot-free after defaulting on dues to the state.

1,Sukhbir scampers as swords flash at rally,"MOGA: Poll enthusiasm got the better of Shiromani Akali Dal (Badal) workers at a rally in Saffuwala village, near here, on Thursday.

Twelve of them were injured, two seriously. Turbans tumbled and swords, sticks and stones were freely used by two groups of the party in an attempt to outdo each other to impress Sukhbir Badal, son of SAD chieftain Parkash Singh and the party candidate from Faridkot.

An uneasy Sukhbir watched for a while before he was whisked away by his bodyguards. Soon after, he left the village. The situation in the village is tense and members of both the groups are camping in good numbers in the area near the civil hospital where two of the seriously injured have been admitted.

Tension had been brewing between two SAD factions of the village, led by Gurmeet Singh Cheema, joint secretary, SAD young wing, and Jagdev Singh, a former sarpanch, for about a week, ever it was decided to organise a rally for Sukhbir.

The flash point was reached on Thursday when Sukhbir, accompanied by Sadhu Singh Rajeana, Baghapurana MLA, and Tarsem Singh Ratian, former chairman of the Punjab Tourism Corporation, arrived to speak at the rally.

Fisticuffs broke out the moment Cheema stood up to offer a gold takdi (scales), the election symbol of SAD, to Sukhbir. Then it was a melee as swords flashed and even neutral youths of the village joined in amid fiery slogan-shouting just as five police personnel watched helplessly.

Extra security was called in but some elders of the village, meantime, managed to pacify the two groups. Surjeet Singh (35) and Amanpreet Singh (25), son of Jagdev Singh, with head injuries and sharp cuts, were taken to the Moga civil hospital.

Cheema alleged that it was a preplanned attack on him by Jagdev Singh and his supporters. ""He is envious of my closeness with Sukhbir,"" Cheema said, and accused Jagdev supporters of snatching away the gold takdi.

Jagdev Singh said Cheema supporters had first attacked his men. ""Cheema is a police tout and was upset when he came to know that I was to tell all to Sukhbir,"" he said. Both groups owe allegiance to Sadhu Singh Rajeana and Tarsem Singh Ratian and differences between them had been simmering since the 2002 assembly elections.

As one would expect, meanwhile, no case has been registered by the police till reports last came in. Senior party leaders, Sukhbir included, are believed to be trying for a compromise between the two hyped-up groups.
