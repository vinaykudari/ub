0,Paswan eyes polls in Gujarat,"AHMEDABAD: Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) president Ram Vilas Paswan has sought imposition of President''s rule in Gujarat till the Assembly elections.

He said that keeping in view the unrest caused by the recent riots, elections should be held only when normalcy returns. ""Besides, polls cannot be held under Narendra Modi as care-taker chief minister"", he asserted.

Paswan told mediapersons that just a few days back the Election Commission had declared that polls would be held as per schedule. ""The move for early elections has been engineered to exploit post-riot sentiments of the people,"" he alleged.

Paswan, who is on a six-day tour of Gujarat, announced that the LJP would be contesting the Assembly elections in the state. ""We will be taking a stand against the exploitation of the Dalits by the BJP, which is just using them for political gains,"" said Paswan.

He added that the LJP would try to bridge the gap between the Dalits and the Muslims, and gather their support. Paswan said, ""we are open to tie-ups with secular forces.""

1,Cong's winning streak in polls continues,"RAJKOT: The Congress on Saturday continued its winning streak in elections after it captured the post of nagarpalika president in Amreli, Junagadh and Keshod, while the BJP could win only in Khambhaliya. The election in Savarkundla, however, was marred by a brawl among members.

The election results for the post of president and vice-president in the nagarpalikas have come as a rude shock to the ruling BJP, which was now gearing up to face the voters. The issue has also been brought to the notice of chief minister during his visit here.

While Girish Kotecha and Bala Rada of the Congress were elected as president and vice-president, respectively, of the Junagadh nagarpalika, Kishore Dattani and Ranabhai Jam of the BJP were elected as president and vice-president, respectively, of the Khambhaliya nagarpalika.

In Amreli, even though groupism raised its ugly hand in Congress, it managed to ensure the victory of its candidate. As many as nine members of the Congress remained absent but then the BJP members voted for the Congress candidate and ensured their victory.

The open dissidence in the BJP was a big let down for the BJP MP and state vice-president Dileep Sangani. Mohan Sojitra of the Congress was elected as the president while BJP''s candidate was elected as the vice-president.

In Savarkundla, however, the election was marred by a brawl among members who hurled chairs, pin cushions and files at each other. When the situation went out of control, the chief officer had to call the police to bring the situation under control.

The meeting room resembled a battleground. Spectacles, chappals, files and chairs were strewn all over the place. Some of the elected representatives complained of being hit on the ear while one said he was slapped by the Opposition members.

Out of the 36 members, two from the BJP and one from the Congress had remained absent. Both the groups were anticipating defeat which resulted in this ugly scene.

Both the groups then lodged complaints and counter complaints in this connection. According to the present president, Vijyaben Ramani, it was not decided when the next meeting would be held to elect the new president.

2,Rs 50-lakh life policy? Join Pune queue,"PUNE: Which Indian city has the largest number of families with annual income of over Rs 5 lakh? Mumbai? Wrong. Itâ€™s Pune.

Donâ€™t believe it? You should, because the data comes from Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), which should know.

Still donâ€™t believe it? Chew on this: life insurance policies of over Rs 10 lakh have become small change in Pune today.

â€œLast year alone, we received as many as 60 requests for policies ranging from Rs 50 lakh to Rs 1 crore, as also 29 proposals for policies of Rs 1-crore-plus each,â€� says Deepak Onkar, senior regional manager, LIC, whose jurisdiction extends over Pune, Ahmednagar and Solapur districts.

But Puneâ€™s leadership could be temporary. Mumbai has at least 2,000 pending proposals for policies of Rs 50 lakh or over, while one pending proposal is for as much as Rs 50 crore. A Pondichery jeweller has actually been insured for Rs 50 crore!

â€œPrimarily, the people asking us for very high-value policies are businessmen; NRIâ€™s and toprung corporate executives, in that order,â€� says Onkar.

Adds Milind Mane, LICâ€™s best-performing development officer in the area: â€œThe highest-ever policy in this region has been of the order of Rs 7.5 crore, and I myself have facilitated one worth Rs 3 crore.â€�

Among the clients he and his group of 17 agents service are 250 people insured for Rs 25 lakh-plus each; 50 for Rs 50-lakhplus each, and a good 30 in the one-crore-plus bracket.

Why has Pune taken to banking colossal sums with the insurance behemoth? â€œMany of our old clients (LICâ€™s customer base in Pune alone is a whopping 3 million) have, over the years, prospered and these people have exhibited their brand loyalty,â€� claims Onkar, adding: â€œPeople are parking substantial sums with us primarily for safety and security, in an uncertain ambience of fluctuating returns. Also, large policies enable them to get substantial loans to expand their businesses, since the policies work as collaterals.â€�

The introduction of private competition has also stirred things up a bit. LIC has managed to get some big bucks in the recent past with its â€œKey Manâ€� policy, under which corporations purchased policies in the names of their top executives, as an insurance against their death or resignation.

â€œBasically, it was the monetary loss to the concerned company that was being insured,â€� explains V.D. Sudane, also a marketing manager. And since the really big celebs live elsewhere, mega â€˜Key Manâ€™ policies are going elsewhere. According to sources, among the rich and famously insured are Amitabh Bachchan and Sourav Ganguly (both in crores); music maestro Illayaraja (Rs 1 crore), film star Prabhudeva (Rs 3 crore) and Subhash Ghai, whose â€œKey Manâ€� policy was for a staggering Rs 18 crore!

And this is only the tip of the iceberg. â€œThough weâ€™re big,â€� says Deepak Onkar, â€œwe still only cater to just 22 per cent of Indiaâ€™s eligible (insurable) population, so there is scope for everybody.

For the consumer, the increased choices brought in by global giants like Allianz AG (with worldwide written premiums of $60 billion), and global No.2 AIG, which has tied up with the Tata group, can only be beneficial.

In the end, however, not all of the dozen-odd new entrants in the insurance sector will bask in billions: conventional wisdom says that the insurers with the deepest pockets are liable to make off with the largest piece of the insurance cake, since it is a very capital-intensive business.

4,Violence marks Jharkhand bandh,"JAMSHEDPUR: The insider-outsider divide troubling Jharkhand led to large-scale violence and firing between pro and anti-domicile groups on Saturday in East Singhbhum and Saraikela-Kharswan districts during the bandh called by a section of the pro-domicile group.

Pro and anti-domicile groups traded fire near Tatanagar railway station in East Singhbhum district and before Adityapur Industrial Area Development Authority office in Saraikela-Kharswan district, police said. Pro-domicile groups attacked railway quarters near Tatanagar railway station, entered the station twice and ransacked a telephone booth, damaged several kiosks and vehicles in the area and forced shopkeepers to down shutters, they said.

As violence spiralled in the steel city, authorities deployed the rapid action force at Govindpur and Mango areas, East Singhbhum deputy commissioner Nidhi Khare said, adding the situation in the two areas was tense. Pro-domicile squatted on railway tracks at Salgajhuri, near here disrupting railway traffic, they said.

DGP control room sources at Ranchi said bandh supporters stoned the Rajdhani Express near Dhanbad damaging window panes but none was injured. Heaps of tyres were piled on the railway tracks affecting movement of trains briefly, IG (railways) Niaz Ahmed said.

Railway sources said the Kurla-Howrah Express and Mumbai-Howrah Geetanjali Express were detained at Tatanagar railway station while the Howrah-Rourkela Ispat Express was detained beyond Asanboni station.

The bandh supporters set on fire a truck near R D Tata School under Golmuri police station in Jamshedpur and damaged dozens of vehicles, including autorickshaws at Bardwari, police said. They also gheraoed Govindpur police station following lathicharge to disperse the clashing groups.

5,6 arrested for State Bank exam paper leak,"BIHARSHARIF: Six persons, including a coaching institute teacher and two examinees, were arrested on Friday night near PMS College under the Laheri police station here for their alleged bid to leak the question papers of the State Bank of India probationary officersâ€™ exam scheduled to be held on Sunday.

Chief PRO of the SBI P K Banerjee said in Patna that advertisements have been put in newspapers that the exam would be held as scheduled.

According to Nalanda SP Amit Lodha, the arrested persons were Sanjiv Kumar, Raso Ram and Sujit Ram of Bhikhanibigha village under the Asthama police station of Nalanda district, Harishankar Choudhary, a teacher at the Excellent Banking Coaching Centre, Patna, Vivek Kumar of Jhumri-Tilaiya and Amit Bhardwaj of Begusarai.

Police raids were conducted at Ramchandrapur here and at Bhikhnapahari in Patna.

The police said Sanjiv and Raso were arrested on suspicion. They were brought to the Laheri police station where they received a call from Patna on their mobile saying that three persons were staying at the Gitanjali hotel of Biharsharif. The call was intercepted by the police. The police then raided the hotel where they arrested Harishankar and two candidates for the SBI exam, Vivek and Amit, and recovered papers like admit cards etc.

Vivek and Amit reportedly told the police that they had agreed to purchase the question papers for which they were to pay Rs 5 lakh each and that they had already given an advance of Rs 25,000 each to Sanjiv for the same. The accused had allegedly promised to hand over the question papers to them at a Ranchi centre before the exam.

Lodha said one Patel of Goregaon (West Mumbai) had managed to leak the question papers in collusion with a senior SBI officialin Mumbai and employees of the press where the question papers were printed in Mumbai.

The police also raided the house of Rakesh Kumar in the Ramchandrapur area of Biharsharif town, where the bag containing the question papers was said to have been kept. But in course of the raid, it was found that the question papers had been shifted somewhere else.

Sanjiv reportedly admitted that he had been running this racket for the last two to three years.

6,Gujarat polls likely to be held in Sept,"NEW DELHI: The Vajpayee government is keen on holding elections in Gujarat in September. The Centre has September 17 and 18 in mind, whereas the Modi government prefers to take the state to the polls on October 8 after completing a year in government on October 7.

But senior leaders in the Union government and the Bharatiya Janata Party are against holding the Gujarat elections simultaneously with Jammu and Kashmir polls, scheduled for October. Also, October 8 would coincide with navratra, a difficult time to hold the polls in Gujarat.

A senior Cabinet minister specified on Friday that â€˜â€˜elections in Gujarat are preferred before the Kashmir polls, which is why the government wants to get over with Gujarat in Septemberâ€™â€™.

The Election Commission is, however, opposed to holding the polls in the state so soon. The Union government is trying to convince the EC about its viewpoint, say government sources.

Former law minister and Rajya Sabha MP from Gujarat, BJPâ€™s general secretary Arun Jaitley met Chief Election Commissioner James Lyngdoh last week to discuss the issue. Jaitley pointed out that under constitutional provisions the EC could not refuse to hold the polls in Gujarat at a time that the government wanted.

As a first step, the government has decided that it does not want to go in for a confrontation with the EC as the situation might be exploited by the Opposition to its advantage. Hence, the government would first try to appease the CEC and convince him.

Former security adviser to the Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi K P S Gill met Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani on Saturday and submitted a report to him saying security was not a problem in the state anymore and that the atmosphere was conducive for holding elections.

Joint secretary-level home ministry officials will also be holding discussions with the EC in an attempt to build a case for polls in September.

The issue was also discussed in detail by party leaders at BJP president Venkiah Naiduâ€™s house on Friday morning. At the government-level, it was discussed in a meeting at Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayeeâ€™s residence the same evening.

The strategy that the government has adopted is that if the EC refuses to accept the demand for September polls, the BJP will then turn it into an issue and raise the point day after day.

If the EC does not agree, the polls will have to be held in February, which the BJP feels will turn the situation to its advantage. The BJP will then say that the EC has been trying to stop it from holding early polls, and it is a conspiracy to stop the party from winning the elections.

If Presidentâ€™s rule is not imposed on Gujarat, the election will have to be held within February. And there is no possibility of governorâ€™s rule being imposed in the state as niether Governor Bhandari will recommend it nor the Modi government will not ask for it.

The Centre, too, is not recommending it either. So the government is trying to convince the EC by asking how will the EC benefit if polls are held in February and not in September.

8,Centre for Governor's rule in J&K,"NEW DELHI: In the light of intelligence reports that terrorists are planning to disrupt the Jammu and Kashmir elections, the Vajpayee government is in favour of imposing Governor''s rule in the state.

As the National Conference (NC) is opposed to the move, a confrontation is imminent between New Delhi and Srinagar. J&K Chief minister Farooq Abdullah, who was earlier keen on Governor''s rule, seems to have developed cold feet, with there being strong differences of opinion within his party on the issue. The Opposition parties in the state are also opposed to it.

Intelligence reports say while infiltration had not stopped, terrorists have specific instructions from across the border to disrupt the polls. There are clear instructions to carry out more carnages on the lines of the one at Qasimnagar.

It''s also feared that terrorists would target political leaders, especially those favouring the political process. In fact, those parties which favour elections, are already receiving threats from militants. Hurriyat leaders, who refused to respond to the United Jehadi Council''s call for boycotting the elections, have also been warned.

Keeping this in mind, the Cabinet committee on Security (CCS), which met on July 14 after the Qasimnagar killings, has decided on a multi-pronged strategy to counter this threat.

This includes strengthening of border management, galvanising the intelligence machinery, neutralising plans of the ISI and militant outfits and setting up outposts in vulnerable areas.

The latest intelligence reports say Al-Qaida terrorists have set up three exclusive camps in PoK in the last few weeks and Pakistani terrorist outfits have joined hands with them. They were given safe passage from Afghanistan to PoK through Pakistan''s tribal belt, it added.

As part of its preparation for the polls, the government is trying to finish border fencing along the international border and the Line of Control before October. Work on this has already started by the Border Security Force.

Israeli sensors, proving to be successful in reducing infiltration of militants, have been installed in Poonch, Rajouri, RS Pura, Samba, Uri, Kupura and Kargil sectors.

9,"Talks between PWG, govt fail","HYDERABAD: The collapse of the government-People''s War (PW) talks on Friday has created a hair-trigger situation in parts of the state where the naxalite group holds sway.

Announcing his party''s withdrawal from talks on Friday, People''s War state committee secretary Ramakrishna declared the extremists'' intention to squarely â€˜take on'' the police now on. The police are bracing up for an escalation of hostilities in several parts of the state, especially northern Telangana.

While political leaders are reportedly leaving the interior areas, people are dreading the possibility of being caught in the crossfire. Fraying their nerves further, Prajashakti, a self-styled group of naxalites, blew up the building of a Telugu Desam Party leader in Velair village in Station Ghanpur constituency of Warangal district during the early hours of Saturday.

The police machinery has been put on alert expecting an escalation of violence by the naxalite group in the days to come. Intelligence officials are taking the threat seriously and anticipate a stepped-up offensive by the militants.

The police department has cautioned personalities on the PW hit list not to go to the interior areas without adequate security.

The reaction of ordinary people in north Telangana to the collapse of the talks has been one tinged with fear. An eerie silence has descended on the forest belt of Narsampet, a hotbed of the People''s War.

Often caught in the cross-fire between the naxalites and the police, villagers here had hoped that the talks would end in a sustained ceasefire if not lasting peace. Although many villagers are tightlipped, the failure of the peace effort is the hot topic of discussion.

â€œNow the dalams may resort to more violent acts and the police may increase anti-naxalite operations. It will have a serious impact on our normal life,'''' said a young man in the Anantha Sagar village in Hasanparthi mandal in Warangal district.

Former naxalites and sympathisers of the PW in this erstwhile bastion of extremism are apprehensive that the naxalites and police may now square off with renewed acrimony. Fearing just this outcome, a villager, Janapatla Raju, said, â€œWe will become the scapegoats either way.''''

The villagers of Jadalapet â€” none of them willing to be identified â€” blamed the government for forcing the naxalite group''s withdrawal. â€œFirst, the government did not prevent encounters. Then they renewed the ban on People''s War. In districts like Khammam, they invoked Pota on suspected naxalite couriers. This is exposing the ambiguity of administration during the talks period,â€� said a CPI supporter.

10,Jharkhand tense after group clash,"JAMSHEDPUR: The insider-outsider divide troubling Jharkhand led to largescale violence and firing between pro and anti-domicile groups on Saturday in East Singhbhum and Saraikela-Kharswan districts during a bandh called by a section of the pro-domicile group.

The two groups opened fire near Tatanagar railway station in East Singhbhum district and before the Adityapur Industrial Area Development Authority office in Saraikela-Kharswan district, police said.

11,Tech-savvy govt fails to provide for chalks,"HYDERABAD: Will the chief minister''s pledge to make the city''s 411 government schools safer and better places to be in by August 15 end up being one more entry on his long list of â€œbroken promises?â€� It could well be.

Consider this: Teachers in these schools have to buy chalk from their own pockets, simply because the government-earmarked funds for the purchase of such basic teaching tools do not reach them on time, or because the sum is too paltry to make do with.

Government schools need 50,000 boxes of chalk every year and each of the 5,000 teachers uses up about 10 boxes. The department of education releases an annual grant of Rs 2,000 to each institution. This sum is to be used for everything â€” from cleaning toilets, to buying blackboards and dusters. That too, is released on March 30 â€” that''s the last day of the financial year.

â€œHalf the time the notification doesn''t even reach us. Or even if it does, it is far too late. The process of collecting the grant is far too complicated. There are so many forms to be filled. As such, we are short staffed. We can''t afford to waste a full day at the department of education office for the pittance. There are classes to be taken,â€� says a principal.

So, the teachers do not have an alternative. They have to buy their own chalk. And there are 5,000 of them in the city. Together, they buy a whopping Rs 2 lakh worth of chalk every year.

â€œThe chalk boxes cost between Rs 7 and Rs 10. But, since we buy them in bulk we get a discount. Begum Bazar and Osmangunj shopkeepers usually give them to us for Rs 4,â€� a teacher says.

Often, the teacher pool in money and buy chalks and dusters. In fact, dusters are a rare commodity in these schools. â€œWe make do with handkerchiefs,â€� he says.

And such being the sorry state of affairs, the school authorities have to be stingy about giving chalks to the staff. â€œNormally, each teacher gets only one or two pieces of chalk a day,â€� said a government school headmaster. â€œChildren love chalk. But we are forced to keep these out of their reach. It''s sad,â€� he said.

The government says it is aware of the problem and is trying its level best to rationalise the distribution of grants, so that schools can purchase essential equipment.

â€œWe make sure that the principals get to collect the funds easily and use them judiciously,â€� R Jesupadam, Hyderabad district education officer, said.

12,Ficci seeks anti-circumvention law in anti-dumping,"NEW DELHI: The government should seek provision for an anti-circumvention law under the WTO anti-dumping agreement to check the growing tendency of countries to circumvent anti-dumping duties, Ficci said on Sunday.

""In absence of an anti-circumvention law, if dumping is taking place through circumvention, then one has to go through the long course of anti-dumping investigation,"" Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry said in a statement.

The present anti-dumping agreement contains no provision or discipline on measures against circumvention due to which several countries like the US, EU, Argentina and Canada have resorted to unilateral anti-circumvention measures.

Putting in place such a provision would enable an anti-circumvention investigation to be considered as an extended part of an ongoing anti-dumping investigation thereby reducing the time taken for imposing duties.

Ficci pointed out that under the EC law, four conditions had been listed to prohibit imports under anti-circumvention law. These included a change in pattern or trends in trade of finished products and components, the degree of value addition, remedial effects of duty and evidence of dumping.

The chamber said in addition to these four, some other conditions could be added to make the system more effective.

The assignment of specific responsibilities once again reflected the predominance of younger leaders.

Former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Rajnath Singh would be in charge of Uttar Pradesh, Uttaranchal, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Haryana, Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir.

Arun Jaitley, another general secretary, will be in charge of 12 states and Union Territories -- Delhi, Himachal Pradesh, Chandigarh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Goa, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Kerala, Pondicherry and Andaman and Nicobar.

15,Badal flays CM for not giving relief to farmers,"JALANDHAR: Former Punjab Chief Minister and Akali Dal President Parkash Singh Badal on Sunday criticised the state government for allegedly not taking any initiative to provide relief to farmers affected by the drought-like situation in the state.

""It seems Captain Amarinder Singh does not bother about the plight of poor farmers as till now he has not even apprised the Centre about the condition of farmers due to delayed monsoon"", Badal told reporters here on Sunday.

""As a first step the state government should waive the agriculture loans taken by farmers,"" he said.

""During our tenure we used to buy power from the other states to feed rural sectors in the paddy season. Even last year also we purchased power worth Rs 300 crore for the purpose"", Badal said adding steps like imposing power cuts on urban and industrial sectors would not fulfill the requirement.

On the state government''s anti-corruption drive, Badal reiterated that the probe into the Punjab Public Service Commission (PPSC) scam should be handed over to CBI as people do not have faith in the vigilance bureau, which he alleged was being used to settle political scores.

The chief minister was afraid that the malafide intentions of the state government in the investigation would be exposed if CBI handles the case, he alleged.

He expressed confidence that an NDA team would soon visit the state to examine excesses being conducted on Akali workers.

Badal said the delay in visit was due to pre-occupation of union government on other important issues.

17,All protests lead to Parliament Street,"NEW DELHI: Full-scale action is back on Parliament Street again. With Parliament in session, protesters from all walks of life are heading towards this road to lend voice to their concerns.

Almost everyday, the road is choked with slogan-shouting agitators, who grapple with policemen in riot-control gear. â€˜â€˜At times we handle over 10 protests a day,â€™â€™ said a Parliament Street police officer. Till June 2002, the street witnessed over 1,100 demonstrations involving about 41,000 people. And last year, over 2.46 lakh people held 1,859 demonstrations.

A look at the police norms suggests it is not difficult to obtain permission to hold protests.

â€˜â€˜Anybody can approach us for permission to hold a march 200 metres down the Parliament Street, starting from Jantar Mantar,â€™â€™ said an officer.

â€˜â€˜Problem occurs when protesters try various tricks to get noticed. And the most common way to do so is to try and break the police cordon,â€™â€™ said an officer.

â€˜â€˜But we keep a water canon ready for violent protesters,â€™â€™ said deputy commissioner of police (DCP), New Delhi, Mukesh Kumar Meena. Besides disciplining demonstrators, using barricades, ropes and canes, the police are also expected to extend hospitality to them.

â€˜â€˜We also keep two tankers to provide potable water for protesters,â€™â€™ said Meena.

Of all the occasions which bring protesters to the Street, the Budget Session proves the most gruelling for the police. â€˜â€˜Maximum demonstrations, also involving greater number of women, are held during budget session,â€™â€™ said the officer.

Elaborate security arrangements are put in place to deal with protests. â€˜â€˜If it is a peaceful agitation, we deploy about five companies,â€™â€™ said another officer.
