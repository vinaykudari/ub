0,Principal opens office in toilet,"NEW DELHI: A toilet might have various uses but being forced to use it as the office space for a school principal does require a wild stretch of one''â€™s imagination. Yet circumstances have forced a Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) school principal to do just that.

A primary school in north-west Delhi''s Bhalswa resettlement colony has over 1,000 students who have been studying under tents for the past two- and- a- half years.

The 100-metre area has just two rooms that were supposed to function as toilets. Fittingly enough, one has been converted into an office cum storage area for the principal. The other is used as a toilet but reserved for the 20-odd teachers.

Lesser mortals like students are forced to relieve themselves in the open. As the principalâ€™s room doubles up as a store room, there is only enough space for a desk, chair and one person to stand in the room.

The school has a boundary wall but that is where the facilities end. There are no provisions for water, electricity or furniture.

â€˜â€˜The teacher sits on a plastic chair while we sit on the floor. We use slates for our work,â€™â€™ murmurs Kundan, a student. Students from classes I to V study here.

â€˜â€˜It is almost impossible for the children to study when it gets too cold or too hot.

Yet, no effort has been made to improve the situation,â€™â€™ Vikas Saini, a social worker from Bhalswa said.

Incidentally, even though the school may not have any amenities, it does have a foundation stone that lists out the office-bearers, ready to take credit.

These include mayor Ashok Kumar Jain, Congress leader and standing committee chairman Ram Babu Sharma and area councillor Rattan Pal Sansanwal.

Ram Babu Sharma said, â€˜â€˜I will look into the matter immediately and a building will be constructed for the students as soon as possible.

1,Rural satraps hold key to Council polls,"BANGALORE: They are like elections to the Legislative Assembly but on a small scale. But a decisive factor in these polls is the gram panchayat members, who hold the key to the candidates'' victory.

These are elections to 25 seats in the Karnataka Legislative Council from the Local Authorities'' constituencies. Polls to these seats will be held on December 1.

Presently, the ruling Congress and opposition parties are busy shortlisting names of probables with the last date for nomination papers filing being November 14. Of the 25 members retiring, maximum are from the Congress (12) including two ministers â€” Basavaraj Patil Humnabad and T. John â€” BJP (2) and the rest shared by the Janata Parivar.

Stakes are high for the Congress. â€œIt has the dual responsibility of not only retaining the 12 seats but adding a few more as bonus. These seats were won by the party in December 1997 when it was in opposition,'''' party sources said.

The JD(S) plans to contest 20, while the BJP appears not too keen. ""Our presence in panchayats and civic bodies is almost nil,"" a functionary said. AIPJD floor leader in the Assembly B. Somashekhar said his party will renominate all the four retiring members and consider fielding more.

But the maximum activity is happening in the Congress camp with the party collecting non-refundable fee of Rs 10,000 for each application form issued. Of Rs 10,000, Rs 5,000 is for the party''s building fund. Scheduled castes and tribes have to pay Rs 2,500 per form.

""The format is similar to the one issued in the 1999 Assembly elections. Candidates have to furnish information on their length of association with the party, whether they left the party, rejoined or from which party they came, whether they contested in the past and its results,"" sources said.

The 25 seats include ""dual seats"" in the districts of Dharwad, Bijapur, Belgaum, Mysore and Mangalore. This means two candidates will be elected from each of the districts through ""preferential voting.""

A major concern is wooing 80,000 members in the 5,659 GPs who have been elected on non-party basis. ""Each party will claim it has a hold on GPs, while in many cases voting pattern of these members is decided by the village head,"" AIPJD MLC Basavaraj Bommai, who has begun his campaign to seek a second term, said.

As for zilla and taluk panchayats and civic bodies, there has been regrouping and switching of parties by some members during the last six years. ""Candidates will have to toil for victory. No two candidates of one party have ever won from dual seats,"" an observer said.

2,Govt rules out CoD inquiry into suicide,"BANGALORE: Urban development minister D K Shivakumar on Saturday turned down Anekal MLA Narayanaswamy''s demand for Corps of Detectives inquiry into local municipality president Manjula Adikeshava''s suicide. ""The government does not feel the need for CoD probe. Special squads have been formed to nab persons whom Manjula has held responsible for the suicide. Action will follow as soon as the police submit their report.""

Asked whether action will be initiated against Narayanaswamy whose name figures in Manjula''s suicide note, the minister said: ""The law will take its own course.""

â€˜Charge baseless'': Former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda''s son H.D. Kumaraswamy termed as ""baseless"" Narayanaswamy''s allegations against him over the suicide note left by Manjula. ""Narayanaswamy said the suicide note was released after I met the victim''s family members. It is false. The note was deliberately held back for the fear that it might be destroyed by the accused,"" he said.

â€˜Arrest culprits'': JD(S) leader P.G.R. Sindhia urged the government to immediately arrest the culprits who are involved in the death of Manjula.

Speaking after inaugurating a training programme for women party workers here, Sindhia said: ""Manjula has clearly named the Anekal MLA and other leaders in her suicide note. But it is shameful that they have not been arrested till date.""

3,Lobbying begins for council polls,"CHIKMAGALUR: Hectic lobbying has begun in the Congress party in the district for elections to the Legislative Council from the local bodies, scheduled for December 1.

The Congress, which lost the seat to Janata Dal in the previous election, is making all efforts to usurp it this time and choice of the candidate will be done accordingly.

The contenders from the party have risen to nine, of whom three are strong contenders, according to sources.

B L Ramadas, former zilla Panchayat president who lost to the Dal candidate in the last election, is leaving no stone unturned to get a ticket and his case has been recommended by all the 14 Block Congress Committees in the district.

Ramadas told The Times of India that his chances of getting ticket were bright and senior leaders were aware of his experience. Ramadas, who is also the District Congress president, has the backing of all the three ministers from the district, say his supporters.

Neelakantappa, MLA, has urged the party high command to consider his henchman Suresh for the candidature saying this would help the party in the ensuing general elections.

Other strong contenders are H.B. Shivanna from Mudigere and T D Rajegowda, former ZP president.

However, KPCC president Janardhana Poojary and chief minister S M Krishna, who discussed the selection of candidate with ministers and the district leaders at Bangalore, have not taken any decision.

4,"Modi, Hema to counter Digvijay in polls","BHOPAL: The BJP is all set to launch a hi-tech star-studded election campaign in Madhya Pradesh. Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi and former Bollywood dream girl and Rajya Sabha member Hema Malini will be the star-campaigners.

To ensure a flying start to the whirlwind campaign across the 230 assembly constituencies in the state, the party has hired five helicopters. Three have already reached here, while two others will arrive in a couple of days. One chopper has been engaged for the exclusive use of chief ministerial candidate Uma Bharti. In addition, the party will hire a plane exclusively for night travelling.

Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee will address six public meetings, Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani 18, and party president Venkaiah Naidu will address a number of election campaigns.

Narendra Modi will be in Madhya Pradesh from November 21 to 25 covering all the districts adjoining Gujarat including Jhabua, Ratlam, Neemuch and Mandsaur. According to BJP sources, Modi will address 40 meetings. During the last 1998 assembly elections, Modi was in-charge of the BJPâ€™s campaign in Madhya Pradesh. He was not a chief minister then and the party faced defeat.

The sources claimed Modi will use all his skills to ensure the defeat of the Congress as during the Gujarat elections chief minister Digvjay Singh had put-in all his strength to defeat Modi. â€˜â€˜Now its Modiâ€™s turn,â€™â€™ they said.

While BJP national general secretary Pramod Mahajan will address 15 meetings, Union law and commerce minister Arun Jaitley will address 22 meetings in five days. Union minister Sushma Swaraj will address 15 meetings, Hema Malini 15, former Bollywood starts-turned ministers in the Vajpayee cabinet Shatrughan Sinha and Vinod Khanna eight each.

Union agricultural minister Rajnath Singh will spend three days in Thakur-dominated areas. Union textile minister Shahnawaz Hussain and BJP spokes-man Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi will spend two days each in Muslim-dominated areas.

5,Pak minister live on DD?,"NEW DELHI: When Sushma Swaraj attended the Saarc information ministersâ€™ meet in Islamabad last year, PTV interviewed her live. Gujarat was burning and the Indian High Commission had mixed feelings.

In the event, Sushma handled the pressure well. A nervous I&B delegation was so overwhelmed it suggested Doordarshan â€˜â€˜reciprocateâ€™â€™ by interviewing the Pakistani information minister when the Saarc ministers meet next in India. Well, that time is now, but neither side seems interested in the present incumbent, Sheikh Rashid, holding forth on DD. â€˜â€˜Itâ€™s not for us to request an interview,â€™â€™ a Pakistani diplomat said, while the Indian side says there is no issue given the number of private channels. â€˜â€˜It might also be odd for DD to interview Rashid but not any of the other Saarc ministers,â€™â€™ an official noted.

Caution, however, seems to be the watchword all around. The Pakistani High Commission is throwing a dinner for their minister on Monday, to which Indian hacks have been invited, but theyâ€™ve decided not to schedule any interviews until after the Saarc meet is over. â€˜â€˜We are keen there be no gad-bad (trouble),â€™â€™ a Pakistani official says.

The glass sky

India and Pakistan may not see eye-to-eye on air links but their respective civil aviation ministries â€” and higher judiciaries â€” agree on one thing: Grounding older air hostesses when their male counterparts are allowed to fly.

Using reasoning identical to that of the Indian apex court, the Pakistani Supreme Court on Thursday declared that the grounding of air hostesses at the age of 45 was not discriminatory. It upheld PIAâ€™s claim that the air hostesses were being pensioned off not because they were women but because they belonged to a â€˜â€˜different cadreâ€™â€™. Air India and Indian Airlines fought their own air hostesses all the way to the SC on the same questionable logic before winning a favourable ruling.

Buffaloes and jihad

An RSS man found himself at a ceremonial do during the visit of the Armenian president last week. With visions of â€˜â€˜Hinduâ€™â€™ India and â€˜â€˜Christianâ€™â€™ Armenia getting together, our man struck up an animated conversation with an Armenian official about jointly taking on the scimitar-wielding hordes of Islamic fundamentalists. Until he was told that Indiaâ€™s $3 million annual exports to Armenia consists almost entirely of buffalo meat. Not exactly the best foundation to build an anti-jihad front.

The Chandrika effect

There is much mirth in South Block over the PMâ€™s request for Advani to take Shekhawatâ€™s place at the anniversary celebrations of Abdul Gayoomâ€™s presidency in the Maldives from Monday. Vajpayee himself leaves for Moscow on Tuesday, while the DPM has appointments in Chennai and Arunachal which take him away from Delhi for most of the six-day period Atal will be abroad. The only gap was Tuesday and Wednesday, but now Atal has made sure Advani will be outside Delhi on those days as well. â€˜â€˜No danger of anybody doing a Chandrika on the PM now,â€™â€™ a wag remarked.

6,Govt plea to refer disinvestment to larger SC Bench,"INDORE: Union communication, information technology and disinvestment minister Arun Shourie on Saturday said the Centre has requested the Supreme Court to refer the disinvestment of public sector oil companies to a larger Bench of the apex court.

Similar cases pending before different high courts of the country should also be referred to the Bench, he told reporters here on the sidelines of a function organised by the Madhya Pradesh Gourav Pratishthan.

Replying to a question about the governmentâ€™s stand on the issue following the apex court ruling, he said â€˜â€˜the government has requested the chief justice of India for a review of the case and also similar cases like Jessop and Hindustan Copper pending in different high courts of the country by referring them to a larger Benchâ€™â€™.

Only after this the government will decide on the issue of taking the matter to the Parliament, he added.

The apex court had held that Parliamentâ€™s approval was necessary for the disinvestment of public sector oil companies like Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) and Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) as they were nationalised with Parliamentâ€™s approval.

Defending the disinvestment policy, he maintained that in the past few months, the public sector companies in the country have attracted disinvestments to the tune of Rs 5,000 crore. He said the production capacity of public sector companies which have been given to private sector companies under the policy, has increased by 250 times in the past three months. He said the Oppositionâ€™s failure to support such a crucial issue will not augur well for the country.

Citing the progress made by the country in the past few years in various sectors, the Union minister said: The countryâ€™s export in the IT sector has touched Rs 60,000 crore mark. In the production of automobile accessories, the country has recorded tremendous growth and within a span of one year, export of agro accessories has touched 1.600 million dollar, he said. Similarly, the mobile subscribers base in the country in the past few months has also increased rapidly and every month, 13 to 15 lakh subscribers are added, going by the statistics of the past five months, he said.

Attributing the lack of development in MP to poor governance, he said the state deserved to come at par with Karnataka, which like MP, is also being ruled by a Congress government. He said the state government lacked visionary ideas which hold the key to development.

He said despite having abundance of cultural and natural wealth, the state was lagging behind as the government had no idea to convert its difficulties into opportunities.

7,Limited change in medical education rules,"PATNA: The medical education departmentâ€™s move to introduce comprehensive amendments in the Bihar Medical Education Service Cadre Rules, 1997, to make filling up the vacant posts of professors and associate professors in six government medical colleges of the state an easier exercise, has failed to take off as the state government has allowed it to make only limited changes in the rules.

The limited amendments have been allowed to enable the department to avoid the derecognition of six medical colleges of the state by the Medical Council of India (MCI).

The Medical Council of India had threatened to derecognise the medical colleges of Bihar if they failed to comply with its directives by June 30. It had also refused to extend the deadline any further.

The MCI is likely to take a decision on October 30. All the six medical colleges have been facing derecognition threat from the MCI for the past five years.

The state government, while allowing the medical education department to make minor changes in the Medical Education Service Rules to promote associate professors to the rank of professors, regularise the services of those holding the posts of professors and associate professors before the formulation of the said Rules, that is May 21, 1997, and appoint retired professors on contract for one year, made it clear to the department that these ad hoc arrangements would be a one-time affair, and not permanent.

The state government will take another month to make the limited changes in the Rules through an executive order as the matter will have to be placed before the state cabinet.

The medical education department, in its turn, will take another three months to fill the vacant posts of professors and associate professors as it will have to hold the meeting of departmental promotion committee and get roster clearance to finalise the names of associate professors found eligible for promotion to the rank of professors.

The Medical Education Service Rules, notified on May 21, 1997, provided for appointment of professors by the Bihar Public Service Commission (BPSC) after advertising the vacant posts on an all-India level.

The government failed to fill the vacant posts through BPSC during the last five years as very few teachers from outside applied for the posts.

Sensing the seriousness of the MCIâ€™s derecognition threat this time, medical education minister Dr Shakeel Ahmad convened a high-level meeting on August 14 to find ways to fill up all the vacant posts of professors and associate professors without any further delay.

Senior government officials, including chief secretary S N Biswas, principal secretary to chief minister Mukund Prasad, medical education secretary Afzal Amanullah, law secretary and personnel secretary Arvind Prasad attended the meeting.

Interestingly, the government took another two months to finalise the proceedings of the August 14 meeting, but not before rejecting the repeated plea of Amanullah to allow the medical education department to make wholesome changes in the aforesaid Rules.

8,Mishra: State govt ignoring Muslims,"PATNA: Former chief minister and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Jagannath Mishra on Friday said that no work for the welfare of Muslims had been done during the 12-year rule of the RJD in Bihar.

Speaking at a felicitation function organised here by the Rashtriya Alpasankhyak Muslim Morcha to celebrate the honour conferred on him by the United Muslim India (UMI), Jama Masjid, New Delhi, and All India Hindi-Urdu Sangam, Lucknow, Mishra said several decisions taken for the welfare of minorities by him during his regime as chief minister were shelved due to his successorsâ€™ apathy to them.

The former chief minister had been conferred with the honour of â€œbakar-e-Urduâ€� by the UMI, the Jama Masjid, New Delhi, and â€˜Ekta Awadh Sammanâ€™ by Sangam at Lucknow.

Citing the instances, Mishra said about 250 Muslims were killed by extremistsâ€™ organisations in Imamganj and Dumaria in Gaya district, but no compensation was paid to their families.

The Bhagalpur Riot Commission report on Bhagalpur riot of 1989 was submitted in 1995, but no action was taken against the guilty people, nor was ex-gratia paid to riot-affected people, he added.

People of the majority community have usurped 3,000 acres land of the minorities, while minorities are yet to be compensated and rehabilitated.

The amount given for rehabilitation of 2,000 families is being realised by force by the state government, he said.

Maulala Mazharul Haque Urdu-Persian University is yet to be set up here and despite state governmentâ€™s announcement to appoint 15,000 primary Urdu teachers, no teacher has been appointed, Mishra also said.

Besides, government advertisements to Urdu dailies and weeklies have been stopped, he stated.

10,Experts want amendment in laws to curb spread of HIV,"VADODARA: A group of lawyers from Mumbai and Delhi have blamed gaps in Indian laws as a major impediment to curb the spread of HIV in the country.

â€œWe have at least Rs 3,000 crore at our disposal and more funds are bound to flow in considering the fact that India is still the obvious choice for manpower hunters across the world. A major part of the funds is being utilised for infrastructure upgradation instead of developing and distributing vaccines,â€� says Mumbai-based advocate Anand Grover, while addressing the national conference on AIDS held in Vadodara on Saturday.

Grover discussed the legal and ethical issues related to HIV and appealed to the medical fraternity to be sensitive to the needs of HIV patients.

â€œA sea change in attitudes is necessary to tackle the issue. If qualified doctors practice strict confidentiality and donâ€™t discriminate, we can put an end to the quack menace,â€� says Grover, who is the director of HIV/AIDS Unit of Lawyerâ€™s Collective in Mumbai, which advocates a comprehensive law that could strengthen public health services.

Advocating a law that respects consent and confidentiality of individuals, protect people from discrimination based on HIV status, Grover said, â€œWe seek to provide a safe haven to the marginalised sections of the society like homosexuals, drug addicts and commercial sex workers. This will encourage them to seek medical intervention.

Now, we are at loggerheads with law as distribution of fresh needles and condoms is banned.â€�

A major social transformation is possible with legal modifications.

HIV is no more restricted to high-risk groups but has filtered down to the general population.

This has made amendments to the existing laws inevitable. Perhaps, a change of law regarding marital rapes, amendment to IPC Section 377 (which bans unnatural sexual behaviour), Immoral Trafficking Prevention Act and the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (prevention) Act, will create a congenial atmosphere for radical improvements in public health, feels Grover.

â€œOur proposals are only peoplefriendly laws that are already implemented in the UK, Australia, Hong Kong, Philippines and US. They will only act as a catalyst to improve public health rather than attack our ethical values,â€� says Grover, underlining the importance of safety of health care workers.

â€œIncidence of HIV infection due to occupational exposure though negligible needs to be addressed. Every health care worker should be provided gloves, vaccines and safer working environment and equipped with knowledge and understanding of diseases.

An insurance cover will be a boon,â€� says Grover.

Referring to the practice of subjecting all patients to HIV tests at private hospitals and making HIV test for employees compulsory at private companies, Grover says, â€œThe law needs an immediate amendment as private sectors can still evade prosecution for discrimination on the basis of HIV status.â€�

â€œThis will glorify the stigma attached to the disease, thus crippling the HIV treatment services.

And HIV tests, prior to surgeries, are like a double-edged sword. If the patient tests positive, he might be deprived of the health services. But if he tests false negative, the doctor is at a great risk as he will falter on caution assuming it to be risk free,â€� he added.

11,"Sop fest on tracks, but no word on polls","HYDERABAD: The suspense lingers. Chandrababu Naidu chaired a cabinet meeting for three hours on Saturday, put his stamp of approval on a sop fest, but said nothing on early polls.

At the meeting, which began around 10.30 am, a slew of welfare measures was discussed and cleared. The only reference he made to elections related to the votersâ€™ lists. He asked his colleagues to ensure that the rolls in their constituencies were suitably updated.

After the session ended, the CM tapped the table, a smile played on his face. â€œ...hmm, thereâ€™s something important... taravuta matladukundaam (weâ€™ll discusses it later) ...you know what it is,â€™â€™ he said.

Apparently, major industries minister K Vidyadhar Rao couldnâ€™t resist responding to this one. We know what you want to discuss. The Congress is raising questions on this talk about early polls one day and answering them the next day, he is said to have told the CM. Naidu smiled and walked out. The media, which had crowded around the venue expecting to hear a major announcement, was left dangling.

Later, a TDP insider said there were chances that a politburo meeting would be called on Nov. 16, followed by another cabinet session, where dissolution of the Assembly could be recommended. A cabinet meet in fact has been scheduled for Nov. 17.

As the CM refused to speak his mind, the rumour mill worked overtime. Some said the government would recommend dissolution on November 19, others insisted this would not happen till after the week-long Chaduvula Panduga got over. The programme begins on Nov. 17.

12,Inspection of PMCH catches govt off guard,"PATNA:The proposed inspection of Patna Medical College Hospital(PMCH), the best among the six government medical college hospitals of the state, on November 17 and 18 appears to have caught the authorities of both medical education department and the college off guard as 32 out of the 42 sanctioned posts of professors are still lying vacant.

All the five posts of professors of the medicine department of the college are lying vacant, while in the surgery department three out the five posts of professors are still vacant. Similarly, in the obstetrics and gynaecology department two out of the four posts of professors are yet to be filled up. In the Ear Nose and Throat (ENT) and Orthopaedics departments the lone post of professor is lying vacant.

All these departments are clinical departments and are supposed to be the mainstay of the medicare system of the hospital.

A senior functionary of PMCH said that apart from the huge vacancies in the rank of professor, a large number of vacancies also existed in the rank of associate and assistant professor. He said that out of the 64 sanctioned posts of associate professors, 21 posts were yet to be filled up. Similarly, he added, out of the 104 posts assistant professors, 61 posts were lying vacant.

In all, 89 santioned posts of professors are lying vacant in the six government medical college hospitals of the state. Five of them including PMCH and Darbhanga Medical College Hospital(DMCH) are facing derecognition threat for the past five years due to their failure to meet the medical council of India(MCI) guidelines.

Meanwhile, sources in the department said that the government was likely to request the MCI to postpone the inspection by three weeks to allow the PMCH to prepare necessary documents regarding various aspects of its functioning for the perusal of the MCI team.

The medical education minister Dr Shakeel Ahmad expressed hope that all the vacant posts of professors in PMCH would be filled up before the arrival of the MCI team.

The establishment committee of the medical education department had in July this year recommended the names of associate professors for promotion to the rank of professors. But, with medical education minister and his deputy making several changes in the list prepared by the establishment committee, the medical education secretary Afzal Amanullah sent the file to the chief minister through the chief secretary last month for her approval.

While informing the chief secretary that Patna High Court was also seized of the matter, Amanullah had requested the chief secretary to ensure that the recommendations of the establishment committee were approved of by the government.The government is, however, yet to clear the concerned file.

Earlier, this year the government had amended the Bihar Medical Education Service Rule, 1997, to allow the medical education department to fill up the vacant posts of professors through promotion as one time affair. It had, however, made it clear that in future all such vacancies would be filled up through Bihar Public Service Commission(BPSC).

13,Six MCD trash trucks being tracked,"NEW DELHI: The Municipal Corporation of Delhi has fitted six sanitation trucks with a vehicle tracking and weighing system. This is part of a two-week pilot project to improve surveillance of garbage collection.

The trucks that will roll out in six of the 12 MCD zones on Monday have been fitted with geographical positioning system (GPS) and geographical information system (GIS) by Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL).

â€˜â€˜This is micro-management of surveillance. We will be able to pinpoint the location of the truck at any given time. It makes skipping dhaloas or dumping garbage at any other place instead of the landfill site impossible,â€™â€™ Rakesh Mehta, MCD commissioner said.

The GIS technology will enable authorities to check the amount of garbage collected and taken to the landfill. â€˜â€˜This information will be electronically transmitted from the landfill site to our central control room that will be set up at Ambedkar Nagar,â€™â€™ Mehta added. Payments will be made after the truckâ€™s record tallies.

Ordinarily the technology would cost Rs 50 to 60 lakh but BEL will fit the trucks on an experimental basis for two weeks.
