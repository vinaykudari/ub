2,State BJP gearing up for Lok Sabha polls,"AHMEDABAD: In view of possible early Lok Sabha elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party is gearing up to improve upon its performance of 1998 elections, in which it had won 21 of 26 seats.

Addressing the first zonal meeting of district-level functionaries of Ahmedabad, Gandhinagar, Kheda and Anand in Gandhinagar, state BJP president Rajendrasinh Rana called upon partymen to play up the achievements of the BJP-led coalition at the Centre and the Modi ministry among the masses.

Partymen were urged to leave no stone unturned to secure all the 26 Lok Sabha seats in the polls.

The party organisation has decided to go ahead with preparations for Lok Sabha and organisational polls even as supporters of former chief minister Keshubhai Patel have been pressurising the state leadership for expansion of the eight-month-old ministry.

It is learnt that over 70 senior leaders, including MLAs of the four districts, also discussed the progress of work undertaken in their constituencies with Rana.

Rana told TNN that the zonal meetings were being conducted with the twin purpose of briefing functionaries on preparation for Lok Sabha elections and also to ascertain their views on organisational polls, process for which has already been initiated at the ward level.

3,PAC indicts govt in handing out flats,"KOLKATA: There were malpractice in the allotment of flats in government housings and misuse of the discretionary powers of the departmental ministers, confirmed the Public Accounts Committee of the state Assembly in its 15th report.

The committee asked for a departmental inquiry into the cases of anomalous and doubtful allotment in its report tabled in the House on Tuesday.

Concurring with the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General of 2000, the PAC found that the housing ministerâ€™s discretion was the â€œonly deciding factorâ€� in the allotment until the high court ordered to make seniority of application the â€œsole criterionâ€�.

â€œProper procedure was not maintainedâ€� and â€œout of turnâ€� allotments were made without proper applications, said the report. The CAG noted that among the 259 allotees outside the list, 225 were given flats despite not being listed in the application register. During 1995-99, only 160 out of 419 allotees were found listed in the register.

â€œThe department had admitted that there were some irregularities in allotment of flats and they had already taken some steps against some persons,â€� noted the committee. Nevertheless, it asked the department to find out the missing application registers of the years before 1982.

It also noted that the department had been working â€œquite lackadaisicallyâ€� in preventing unauthorised occupancy of government flats and demanded stern action within six months.

In another report, the PAC asked the government to set a â€œfirm deadlineâ€� for the recovery of dues and possession of the property at DL Khan Road from the Royal Calcutta Turf Club and institute a case after the expiry of the deadline.

The CAG had pointed out that the arrears of betting tax of the RCTC accumulated to Rs 7.32 crore and government lost another Rs 4.12 crore on interest till March 1999. â€œThe department stated that it had nothing on record as to why this decision to exempt interest was taken,â€� said the CAG. The PAC also strongly recommended that â€œsuch exemption should not allowed in future.â€�

4,"Resignation? No way, says Rly minister","PATNA: In a rebuff to the RSS, railway minister Nitish Kumar has ruled out the possibility of tendering resignation in the wake of increased train accidents. The RSS mouthpiece, ""Panchjanya"", has demanded Kumarâ€™s resignation for failing to prevent train accidents.

Saying he had not read ""Panchjanya"", Kumar stressed that he would not resign. ""When I resigned after the Gaisal train accident, everybody dubbed it as a political drama,"" he remarked at a press meet in Patna on Tuesday. The minister said it is ""factually incorrect"" to say that the number of train accidents has increased during his tenure. ""It has rather decreased,"" he claimed.

The minister said elaborate steps have been taken during his tenure for the safety of passengers. ""On July 12 and 13, a workshop is being organised with the help of various railway employees'' federations in which persons engaged in running trains like station masters, drivers, gangmen, pointmen, control room personnel, signalmen, maintenance personnel and others have been asked to participate. We will learn from them the problems they face at the field-level in ensuring safe journey for passengers,"" Kumar remarked.

He said the ministry has asked officials to conduct surprise checks at various points after engines and bogies come out from maintenance workshops and even on tracks and signals. The minister claimed that the department has always been implementing the recommendations of various railway safety committees, including those of the Justice Khanna committee. ""The Rs 17,000-crore fund for railway safety is a part of that,"" he said, insisting that there would be no shortage of funds for safety programmes. He claimed the funds from the corporate funds for safety are being spent in accordance with the schedule.

""We are entering a new domain in railway safety by undertaking track security,"" he said. He further said if the trains are to be run safely, there has to be better cooperation between the railways and the local law and order enforcing agencies.

The minister said quite a large number of railway employees have been punished for negligence that led to train accidents. He said that after the Rajdhani Express mishap last year, he had constituted a task force for shortening the response time for aid to reach the train accident victims.

""The suggestions include use of helicopters, but they are not used. There are other suggestions like use of the network of the Army as well,"" he added.

5,No secrecy of votes in council polls,"PATNA/SASARAM: For the first time in the history of the Election Commission (EC), the secrecy of votes, to be cast for the 24 legislative council seats from the local bodies'' constituencies on July 10, will not be maintained.

Since most of the voters will be illiterate, they would not be able to identify the names of the candidates of their choice on the ballot papers and exercise their franchise in their favour. As per the directive of the EC, the illiterate voters will have the liberty to take the help of literate persons of the same constituency for exercising their franchise, said sources in the office of the Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) here on Tuesday.

In this election, the voters, instead of putting stamps against the names of the candidates of their choice, will have to write I, II or III in order of preference before the names of the candidates on the ballot papers. Each voter will be entitled for three preference votes. The candidates securing the maximum number of first preference votes would be declared elected, the sources said.

One literate person can assist another illiterate voter of the same constituency only once. He would not be allowed to assist another illiterate voter of the same constituency, for which another literate person would be selected, sources said, adding that no ink would be used to put a mark on the finger of a voter to prevent them from casting another vote. Local people would be there to identify the genuine voters and their assistants and also fake voters or impersonators.

The sources in the Patna and Rohtas-Kaimur district election offices said said they have no information about the total number of the illiterate voters of local bodies, who are not eligible to cast their votes in the election.

In Rohtas and Kaimur districts, out of about 6,000 voters, several are illiterate. The returning officer-cum-district magistrate, Rohtas, told this correspondent that though the administration has no figure of illiterate voters but thanks to the directive of the EC, the illiterate voter will be provided a helper who will help him in casting vote of their choice.

6,Oppn ready to corner govt,"BANGALORE: Shoddy implementation of the mid-day meal scheme in government schools, drought, drug scam, river water disputes, rural weightage and confusion ov-er admissions to professional courses are some of the issues on which the opposition is planning to take the state government to task in the mo-nth-long legislature session beginning on Wednesday.

Mid-day meal scheme, which had been going on smoothly in the seven districts of North Karnataka â€”where it was initially launched last year â€” will have the opposition gunning for the government. The well intentioned programme, now covering 20 districts, went awry due to the manner in which it was handled.

On drought, the government has its own grouse over the Centre not releasing the required quantum of foodgrains under the food-for-work programme.

â€œCongressmen are looting foodgrains and funds for drought and drought is a big boon for them to make fast money. Inflated bills are being submitted to claim funds. The chief minister should investigate into this and depute senior officials to check the ground reality,â€™â€™ BJP opposition leader in the Assembly Jagadish Shettar told reporters here on Tuesday.

The common entrance test (CET) confusion is an issue on which the ruling party will find itself on a sticky ground as majority of the professional colleges are run by Congress members. However, chief minister S.M. Krishna has gone on record that politics has nothing to do with his partymen running educational institutions.

Regarding strength of the parties in both Houses the Congress lost one MLA S.R. Kashappanavar, who died in a road accident. The Janata Parivar has three factions now-JD(U) the lone crusader in P.G.R. Sindhia in the Assembly, 18 MLAs and 11 MLCs of JD(U) have formed a separate entity with the Election Commission registering their All India Progressive Janata Dal. The JD(S) members are intact.

Presiding officers M.V. Venkatappa and B.L. Shankar in the Assembly and Council respectively along with law minister D.B. Chandre Gowda held a meeting with legislature officers for better coordination in running the Houses.

7,One shot dead; 2 youths arrested,"PATNA: One Ram Naresh Prasad Srivastava, an assistant in employment exchange, was shot dead on road number 16 at Gardanibag under the same police station in broad daylight on Tuesday. No arrest has been made so far in this connection.

When contacted, Sachivalaya DSP Arshad Zaman said one Kameshwar Prasad, who belongs to Chapra district, has been made an accused as conspirator behind Srivastava''s killing.

8,HC frowns at criminals in council polls,"PATNA: A division bench of the Patna High Court comprising Chief Justice Ravi S Dhavan and Justice R P Singh on Tuesday expressed its deep concern over criminals contesting the July 10 state legislative council polls from the local bodies constituencies.

""Democracy and criminalisation of politics or politicisation of criminals cannot go together. For the protection of democracy in the country rule of law must be established,"" observed the CJ while hearing a PIL against criminals contesting the polls for filling 24 council seats with the representatives of the local bodies.

""The rule of law demands arrest of criminals, specially those declared absconders. If such a candidate is contesting any election, he should be prevented from doing so,"" the CJ remarked.

Taking cognisance of the PIL filed by the Bihar Rajya Panchayat Parishad, the division bench directed additional advocate general S K Ghose to apprise the court by Wednesday of the number of candidates contesting the council polls who have criminal antecedents or have been declared absconders or have warrants of arrest already issued against them.

Ghose was asked to apprise the court of the steps taken by the state government so far against such candidates as also how they managed to file their nomination papers evading arrest.

Reminding Ghose of the previous orders passed by him after the gram panchayat elections, the CJ said on the basis of those orders the election of some panchayat mukhias, who had been convicted in criminal cases and imprisoned, was cancelled. ""The state government cannot escape its responsibility by stating that the holding of legislative council elections is the concern of the Election Commission,"" he observed.

When petitionerâ€™s advocate M P Gupta drew the attention of the court to the media reports on criminals contesting the council polls, Ghose said that cognisance of media reports should not be taken since they are often false and motivated. Objecting to the remarks, the CJ said the media have proved to be one of the main pillars of democracy in India.

It was some of the major issues raised in the media that the court passed relevant orders which the state government complied with much to the relief of the common people. He cited some of those issues.

When the PIL came up for hearing after the lunch recess, Ghose informed the court that of the 54 candidates filing their nomination papers from the Patna local bodies constituency, one having criminal antecedents was arrested, another was declared an absconder and the nomination papers of 13 others were rejected as they had failed to file affidavits stating their backgrounds.

9,Green fuel flops after govt apathy,"KOLKATA: With the government backtracking on its commitment to convert polluting vehicles into LPG within a year, the sale of auto LPG is abysmally low.

The sole auto LPG dispensing outlet in the city has finally managed to exhaust its first stock of 6,000 litre five months after it was inaugurated with much fanfare. In contrast, the same outlet sells 8,000 litre of diesel in a single day.

â€œThere are hardly any takers for the green fuel. For the first three months, there were no customers. Itâ€™s only in the last couple of months that 14 cars turned up,â€� said Dilip Loyalka, dealer of the auto LPG station on Prince Anwar Shah Road. Needless to say the pump did not seek a refill since the final stock was sold on June 24.

With hardly any cars with LPG kits, customers are virtually non-existent for Loyalka. With no guaranteed business, oil firms are shying away from investing in outlets.

It takes about Rs 40 lakh (excluding land cost) to set up an auto LPG outlet. â€œA proposal for a new outlet is usually submitted with a viability fact-sheet. In case of LPG outlets, there is a constant pressure since investment is high without no break-even targets in sight,â€� oil industry sources said. The four oil firms â€“ Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum, Hindustan Petroleum and IBP â€“ had committed 43 auto LPG outlets in Kolkata by April 2003. The industry then scaled it down to 16 outlets in the first phase. Incidentally, the state government had, in its affidavit to the Supreme Court last year, submitted a blueprint that talked about 75 outlets in the Kolkata metropolitan area in a yearâ€™s time. IOC general manager P.K.

Basu, also the state level coordinator for setting up auto LPG pumps, conceded that the conversion of polluting taxis and auto-rickshaws into LPG-compliant ones had lost steam. â€œThereâ€™s been a lack of cohesive action on all fronts. Though the Public Vehicles Department issued a gazette permitting petrol cars and auto-rickshaws to fit LPG kits in May 2003, no awareness campaigns were conducted. Moreover, kits that cost Rs 16,000 are too expensive,â€� he said.

10,Govt warns colleges over admission rules,"BANGALORE: Higher education minister G. Parameshwara on Tuesday said the state government would file contempt cases against professional colleges that do not comply with the admission rules.

Speaking to reporters here, Parameshwara said the government had finalised and notified engineering, medical and dental seat matrices on basis of the Karnataka High Court order. â€œThe colleges that do not admit students sent by CET would face contempt-of-court charges. The high court will rule on such non-compliance. All colleges must follow the admission rules.â€™â€™

Last week, a vacation bench of the apex court refused to interfere with the high court order based on a petition filed by the Consortium of Medical, Engineering and Dental Courses (Comed). But it asked Comed to file a separate plea before the Chief Justice of India.

The CJI said a decision on hearing the matter would be made after the apex court hears the Kerala governmentâ€™s case on July 10. â€œWeâ€™ve been asked to be present on July 10 when the Kerala case comes up,â€™â€™ Comed counsel Madhusudhan Naik told â€˜The Times of Indiaâ€™.

Parameshwara said the government was planning a Rs 100-crore corpus fund to provide scholarship to meritorious students pursuing professional courses. Talks were on with corporate bodies to provide contributions. â€œWe need time to finalise rules for operation of such a fund,â€™â€™ he added.

The high court on June 30 said the government should fill 75% seats through CET in private unaided non-minority institutions and 50% seats through CET in private unaided minority institutions. It also stipulated the fee as Rs 1.9 lakh for medical, Rs 1.1 lakh for dental and Rs 36,000 for engineering courses.

The government has decided to reserve 10 per cent of the 16,000 seats in diploma courses for ITI students, who can secure direct admissions.

12,Govt rules out talks with broadcasters,"NEW DELHI: The government on Wednesday ruled out any further negotiations with the broadcasters and told them to honour the agreement reached at the meeting at the PMO last week.

The government was also weighing the option of issuing an ordinance to amend the Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Act to bring the broadcasters under its purview. In the existing Act, only the cable operators are answerable to the government. The ordinance may be discussed at the Union cabinet meeting on Thursday.

During a meeting with information and broadcasting minister Ravi Shankar Prasad and PMO official Sudheendra Kulkarni, the top broadcasters called for reconsidering the agreement for making all pay channels free-to-air (FTA) for the four-month period between August and December.

At the earlier meeting, it had been decided that while rolling out CAS in a staggered manner zonewise in the four metros, all channels both FTA and pay would be available for Rs 72 plus taxes.

The broadcasters later expressed their reservations and proposed that the honeymoon period be restricted to one month. They cited massive loss as the reason.

Coming out of the meeting, representatives of the leading broadcasters declined to make any comment on the outcome of their discussion.

The cable operators, on the other hand, appeared a divided lot with one group threatening to go on a hunger strike unless CAS was implemented from original date of July 15 and the others ruling out such a drastic step. ""As we agreed at the PMO, all channels should be made available for Rs 72 as soon as possible, but we are not for a cable strike,"" said Roop Sharma who led a delegation to the meeting with the minister.

In view of the impending deadlock between the broadcasters and the government, the Union cabinet may take up for discussion the ordinance at its meeting on Thursday. Sources claim that a draft has already been circulated.

13,"Aliya, Mahbubia to stay as govt institutes","HYDERABAD: Alarmed over the protest of students from Aliya and Mahbubia government educational institutions against a proposal to hand the institutions over to a private management, school education department commissioner and director Manmohan Singh on Tuesday said there was no such proposal.

""We are surprised to read about students holding a protest on Monday. We do not know where they got this information. The school education department has no such proposal,"" he told The Times of India. ""No orders were issued in this regard,"" he added.

All-India Democratic Students Organisation Hyderabad vice-president K Bharath said the government had issued a memorandum (Memo No 3629/IE1/200-1) to the Board of Intermediate Education to send a report about the handing over of Aliya and Mahbubia to a private management. ""There was a proposal, but we have rejected it,"" BIE secretary B Kripanandam said. Manmohan Singh, however, said the only private participation in every government school was of the education committee, comprising of parents.

""The committee consists of four members â€” parents of students of that school, including a chairman, who is also a parent. These members are elected at a meeting of the parents and the headmaster is the convener of the committee,"" he said.

Though these committees are not too active in the city, the commissioner said, they were doing extremely well in the districts where community participation was greater.

""The minister''s remarks gives us an impression that he is against Telangana and helping non-Telangana farmers,"" CFT leaders A Indrakaran Reddy and P Goverdhan Reddy said at a press conference here on Tuesday.

The CFT alleged that the state government was spending crores of rupees on modernising the Kurnool-Cuddapah (KC) canal, but was hesitant to release funds for completing RDS project.

16,Parliament should enact law to help students: SFI,"KANNUR: The BJP-led NDA government at the Centre should initiate steps to enact a suitable legislation in Parliament to ensure that the fruits of higher education reach the economically and socially backward students in the country, All India Secretary of Students Federation of India Kallol Roy said on Wednesday.

""In the wake of the recent Supreme Court order allowing private educational institutions to evolve their own set of norms in the admission criteria, the only way to save the situation is to take steps to bring in suitable legislation in Parliament to help the socially and economically backward students get better education,"" Roy told reporters here.

In the globalised scenario, education, like any other service, had also become a ""commodity"" and hence, Parliament should pay greater attention to help all students, particularly those belonging to the weaker sections, he said.

On the recent Kerala High Court verdict on banning campus politics, he maintained that every student ""has instinct to form association and involvement of politics will only serve a noble cause by checking criminals and mafia elements"" in education sector.

17,"Nurture small farmers, check privatisation: IPC","VARANASI: The Independent People''s Commission (IPC), in its report on the situation of small and marginal farmers in Uttar Pradesh, has suggested the government that the process of liberalisation and privatisation should be checked and the entry of national or international corporate players in agriculture sector should not be allowed at the cost of small farmers.

It also suggested that the agriculture and related policies should be made as per local needs and conditions, and the entire framework of agricultural policies should be farmer-centred. In its recently released report, the IPC pointed out that approximately 78 per cent of small and marginal farmers of the state are at the verge of acute depression.

The IPC, which was constituted after the convention of Laghu Seemant Krishak Morcha (LSKM), a forum of NGOs and voluntary organisations working in rural areas with the farming community in UP, prepared a detailed report along with suggestions after holding public hearings at seven different places in the state.

At this juncture, the suggestion of IPC has become more relevant. Especially, when people from various walks of life are going to stage dharna in front of the Parliament on September 2 to exert pressure on the government not to go for any new agreement, particularly in the field of agricultural trade multi-lateral capital investment, at the minister level meeting of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) scheduled to be held in Mexico from September 10 to 14 this year. It was felt that the government was withdrawing subsidy and other facilities to farmers.
