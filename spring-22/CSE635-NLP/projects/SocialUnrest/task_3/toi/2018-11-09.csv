5,Revamp of grain procurement policy suggested,"new delhi: faced with a burgeoning stock of foodgrains and inadequate storage space, the union ministry of consumer affairs and public distribution has proposed revamp of the country's foodgrain management system and delinking of the minimum support price from procurement. the ministry is keen on this since by april next year the centre is expected to be saddled with a record foodgrain stock of nearly 75.5 million tonnes. the ministry has suggested that the centre reduce its role in fixing the minimum support price (msp) and have no role to play at all in procurement of foodgrain. according to food minister shanta kumar, not only is the task of procurement becoming unmanageable for the centre but is also costing it a whopping rs 21,000 crore annually. kumar said the proposal is to allow farmers to sell their produce in the open market and be reimbursed the differential between the market price and the msp. he called for a nation-wide debate on the issue. according to kumar, the proposed system will benefit farmers country-wide as under the present skewed system 80 per cent procurement is done mainly from punjab, haryana, and andhra pradesh. he said the system will be linked to the national agriculture insurance scheme, enrolment for which is compulsory for all farmers. the average production of a farmer, his family's consumption and the surplus will be recorded and payments made after taking into account the market price and the msp. as for the requirements of the public distribution system and the buffer stock, kumar said these would be met at the state level through open tenders. about the excess foodgrain stocks with the centre, kumar said these will be distributed among the states through various centrally-sponsored schemes.

6,Former UP minister ready to back SP,"bulandshahr: former bjp leader ashok yadav on thursday said he was ready to strengthen hands of mulayam singh yadav in order to rally the anti-bjp forces in the state. if the anti-bjp vote is divided it will help the communal forces. i will try to unite all the anti-communal forces in the state and i am ready to strengthen mulayam singh yadav if the need arises, yadav, who was sacked from the rajnath singh cabinet for g his opposition to the government's policy on providing reservation to the most backwards, said at a public meeting here. yadav said that he had not yet decided on joining any political party. i have been approached by the congress and the samajwadi party, he said adding that he would take a decision only after the supreme court hearing in december on a pil filed by him against the up government's decision on the job quotas for the most backward castes. yadav stressed that the yadav-muslim combine would act as a deciding factor in the state during the assembly polls in the state with the samajwadi party playing a crucial role in the formation of the next government. the samajwadi party will emerge as a single largest party with over 150 seats in the elections, yadav said. launching a scathing attack on the bjp and rajnath singh government in the state, yadav said the party was attempting to dilute the strength of backwards in the state and induce infighting among the castes. claiming that a number of backward class ministers and leaders in the bjp were supportive of his stand, yadav said that there would be a massive exodus from the party after the supreme court decision on the reservation issue, which, he said, would dramatically affect the politics in the state. accusing the bjp leadership of following caste biases, yadav said the party was deliberately sidelining all the castes except thakurs and brahmins. yadav claimed that the bjp's decision to alienate kalyan singh and himself would damage its chances in at least 100 seats in the state.

""this indifferent attitude not only delayed the project by nine years, but himachal's tottering economy was deprived of crores of rupees from the project,"" they added. the three ministers said it was only because of the sincere efforts of the present government that work on projects totalling 7,100 mw capacity had been started and efforts were on to generate 10,000 mw additional power within the next 10 years, which would fetch the state an additional income of rs 1,800 crore annually. they blamed the policies of the former chief minister and congress party for high power tariff in the state. however, they clarified that despite the state's buying expensive power during winter, it was still supplying power to antodaya families at 70 paise per unit. ---- 5 kg charas recovered the kullu police arrested prem chand and ram lal of manali, on wednesday night, and recovered five kgs of charas from them. the police had set up a naka when they saw two persons carrying rucksacks approaching from pangan.the two had apparently tried to make a getaway. cases have been registered.

19,Cong hopes to do encore in DK polls,"mangalore: the election scene for the urban bodies poll in the dakshina kannada district has undergone a sea change since the congress, under the leadership of chief minister s m krishna, took over the reins of the administration of the state. the fallout was evident during the dakshina kannada zilla panchayat elections last year, where it led to the total annihilation of the bjp in the zp and taluk panchayat polls. of the 31 zp seats, congress bagged 30 and bjp one. bjp's woes continued even in the taluk panchayat, where of the 115 seats in the mangalore tp, 87 went to the congress, 22 to the bjp and remaining to jd-s (4) and jd-u (2). the congress is hoping it could repeat the `magic' in the urban bodies polls scheduled for sunday. the bjp is putting up a spirited fight to counter this total dominance. bjp's woes may be compounded due to the absence of a strong third force to split the congress votes. though the presence of jd (s) and jd (u) are felt strongly in some pockets, its overall presence on the outcome of the polls may not be significant, barring belthangady town panchayat, where the jd(s) has a notable presence and moodabidri town municipal council where the jd(u) is quite strong. on the nomination front, while none of the parties have found difficulty in getting candidates, they have not secured suitable candidates, according to party insiders. all the parties admit, including the congress. there are 353 candidates in the fray for 116 seats in the two town municipal councils and four town panchayats. tmcs are puttur and moodabidri, and tps ullal, belthangady, sullia and bantwal. after the last date for withdrawal of nominations, 60 were in the fray for 27 seats in puttur tmc and 79 for 23 seats in moodabidri tmc. in bantwal, 61 arein fray for 20 seats; 43 for 15 seats in sullia tp; 75 for 20 seats in ullal and 35 for 11 seats in belthangady. in some segments (puttur, bantwal), the fight is between the congress and the bjp and in other segments (moodabidri, belthangady, sullia and ullal), a triangular fight is in the offing. at present, the congress holds power in bantwal, ullal and moodabidri and the bjp in sullia and puttur. the dal (s) has a majority in belthangady tp. while congress and bjp want to increase its tally, dal (s) is hoping to retain belthangady and dal (u) wants to capture power in moodabidri. though it's an urban bodies poll, none of the parties have taken it lightly as it is a significant factor in building up/ testing the grassroots sentiments. despite bickerings in the congress, both janardhan poojary and veerappa moily factions are actively campaigning for the party. so is the bjp with union minister dhananjaya kumar, mla yogish bhat, jd (s) leader vasanth bangera in belthangady and jd (u) with former minister amarnath shetty in moodabidri, despite his ill-health. the main fight in kundapur and karkala tmcs in udupi district is between the congress and the bjp. but there is a remote possibility of other parties trying to put a spanner in the calculations of the main contendors.

20,"Laloo loyalists, lawyers see a ray of hope","patna: even as laloo critics are expecting november 26 to be the `doomsday' for rjd supremo laloo prasad yadav at ranchi cbi court, the party circles are agog with the talks of the possibility of a bail for him. according to them, the element of bail possibility is inherent in the order of the supreme court itself. laloo's petition to the apex court says that all the cases filed against him by the cbi in the fodder scam, including rc 47a, had similar charges; therefore, his lawyer kapil sibal stressed that bail should be granted by the court in this case as well, because his client had already been given bail in cases with similar charges and evidences. the bench, compromising justice k t thomas, justice syed shah mohammad quadri and justice u c banerjee, in their verdict reacting to the submission of sibal that the cases pending in the court contain similar allegations as those, in which bail has already been granted, observed that it is for the petitioner to satisfy the court in this regard. legal experts point out that on november 26, when lawyers of laloo move for a bail, they will strive to prove that case number rc 47a has the same set of charges and evidences as ones giving extension to s b sinha, in case numbers rc 20 and rc 64. ""the cbi has not found any additional fresh evidence against laloo and the court in ranchi is obliged to adhere to the supreme court's directive to find whether any fresh evidence or charges exist in rc 47a,"" stressed a lawyer of laloo. laloo's lawyer insist that it was sibal, who had stated that laloo would surrender before the ranchi court on november 26: ""had we given any other date, there is no reasons to believe that the apex court would have rejected it."" the apex court's verdict also deals with former cm jagannath mishra on the `same footing'. the judges remarked, ""we have no reason to think that the case of mishra, if similarly placed, would be treated differently by the court."" apparently, both rjd chief and mishra would be charging the cbi of including their names in different cases under the `conspiracy angle' with the same set of evidences and charges and would plead to the court in ranchi to give them bail under the directives of the apex court. for the rjd chief, the cbi has already applied for clearance from the governor in two more fodder scam cases. his lawyers insist that these cases are based on the `same charges and evidences', once again.

22,Jaitley stresses on safeguards in terror law,"new delhi: union law minister arun jaitley friday used the forum of the editors' conference on social sector issues to defend the prevention of terrorism ordinance (poto). the only concession he said the government would grant was to accept suggestions for safeguards as long as they don't jeopardise national interests. asking poto opponents to ""consider the connotation of their action"", jaitley dwelt at length on various aspects of the ordinance to set fears at rest. ""legislative framework is needed to fight terrorism, that is why the government brought in poto,"" he said. freezing accounts of organisations funding terrorist networks is needed and so is confiscation of properties earned through terrorism, he said. ""this is not the first time that a law talks of confiscating property. money laundering law, the narcotics act also have provisions for confiscation,"" he pointed out. ""how can forfeiting be draconian in a civil society?"" he asked. similarly, he said, there is no point opposing a ban on terrorist organisations. ""it would be a serious situation where india will be asking others to ban outfits but fails to implement it in the own country,"" jaitley observed. on the question of interception of communication, jaitley justified the provision on the ground that a ""terrorist chooses his victim and time, therefore intelligence agencies should be ahead of them. moreover, interception is admissible as evidence in court"". he highlighted the ""safeguards"" in poto like need for court permission in case of confiscation and the presence of a review committee in case of interception. he criticised the congress and the left parties for calling poto ""draconian"". ""how can the same law be legitimate in maharashtra and not for fighting the jaish-e-mohammad? it defies political logic."" denying charges that no consultation took place, jaitley said during the home ministry's consultative committee meeting, the congress had sought 'special laws' while the cpm asked the government ""to find out what israel is doing"". kerala is the only state which said ""no"" to poto right from the beginning. jaitley also denied that journalists would come within the ambit of poto for keeping information on terrorists or interviewing them. ""the provision that every citizen in possession of information should inform has been there in crpc since 1898. there is nothing new about it. nothing will happen to journalists interviewing terrorists,"" he explained. on a suggestion that this provision be deleted, he said, ""if this is done, the aphorism that the law is an ass will apply.""
