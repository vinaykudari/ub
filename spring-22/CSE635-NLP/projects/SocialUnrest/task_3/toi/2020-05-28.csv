0,Ambika has no plan of contesting LS elections,"HOSHIARPUR:Putting to rest all speculations about her contesting the approaching Lok Sabha elections from the Hoshiarpur constituency, AICC general secretary Ambika Soni while speaking to TNN said she would not be contesting the Lok Sabha elections as she was already a sitting Rajya Sabha member since January 2000. She said she had more than three years in the Rajya Sabha so there was no question of her fighting the fortcoming Lok Sabha elections. Rumours about Ambika contesting the approaching elections from Hoshiarpur had been afloat ever since Ambika had visited Jalandhar on Sunday to attend a function hosted by a vernacular newspaper. It was being said that Ambika had instructed the district Congress president Kuldip Nanda to plan organisational functions, as she was interested in touring the constituency. This had led to widespread speculation that Ambika Soni was gearing to fight elections from Hoshiarpur. Interestingly, Kuldip Nanda denied having received any such instructions from the high profile general secretary but Ambika Soni while speaking to TNN on the phone claimed that she had wanted to visit the constituency primarily for organisational work. She said she would be touring other district headquarters of Punjab as she belongs to Punjab. While clarifying her position Ambika said she was interested in spending two days in Hoshiarpur and meet party workers and listen to their problems in an effort to strengthen the party. She claimed that she almost fought the last Lok Sabha elections from Hoshiarpur and she had conducted organisational meetings at more than four places. Ambika Soni was a probable Congress candidate from Hoshiarpur constituency till Congress president Sonia Gandhi had dispatched her to Bellary in Karnataka to look after Sonia Gandhi's election campaign as Mrs Gandhi was contesting from there. Later on, Charanjit Channi of Nawanshahr was announced as an official Congress candidate. Ambika Soni told TNN that she had special interest in Hoshiarpur as her husband's family belonged to Hoshiarpur and her family trust ran one of the oldest school in village Bajwara in Hoshiarpur district. Ambika in a way indicated that if she does not fight this election, she would still nurse Hoshiarpur.

1,"Debt tribunal freezes govt A/Cs, attaches offices","MUMBAI/PUNE: The Democratic Front government in Maharashtra led by Sushilkumar Shinde received a severe jolt on Wednesday when the the Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT) in Pune pasted notices outside the offices of the central building complex, which houses state government offices, the district collectorate and the divisional commissioner attaching them. The DRT also issued orders for attachment of the accounts of the deputy inspector general of registrar in Mumbai with the Reserve Bank of India and the State Bank of India. The orders, issued by DRT's recovery officer S Ravindra Yadav, restrict any withdrawal/transactions from these accounts. ""Since these accounts are attached, it will lead to a serious liquidity problem and may restrict the government's capacity to pay salaries to its employees,"" an official admitted. However, chief secretary Ajit Nimbalkar assured that the payment of salaries will not be affected. He told TNN that the state will file an appeal before the DRT's appellate tribunal. This is the second time that the DRT has issued orders to attach state government's properties. The attachment order in the earlier instance concerning the Sindhkheda sugar co-ooperative has been challenged by the government in the Bombay High Court. Wednesday's attachment of the government's properties follows the failure of six spinning mills to repay loans amounting to Rs 81.67 crore that were taken in the 1990s from the IFCI (Industrial Finance Corporation of India) and the IDBI (Industrial Development Bank of India), guarantees for which were provided by the state government. The six mills which defaulted on the loans and have ceased production include the Vasantdada Co-operative Spinning Mill (Sangli), Maharashtra Co-operative Spinning Mill Ltd (Jalgaon), Renuka Adivasi Co-operative Spinning Mill (Dhule), Veer Jagdeo Rao Cotton Growers Co-operative Spinning Mill (Dhule), Baramati Co-operative Spinning Mill and the Solapur Weavers Co-operative Spinning Mill.

2,United Akali Dal will win polls: Badal,"ALAMGIR, Ludhiana: Showing clear signs of gaining strength from a united Akali Dal, SAD president and former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal on Wednesday sounded bugle for the coming panchayat elections in the state asking party leaders to gear up to take on the might of the Congressled state government. Talking to newspersons after the meeting of party MLAs including former ones, district jathedars and SGPC members at Gurudwara Manji Sahib here, Badal said that the united Akali Dal was all set to contest panchayat elections and predicted a thumping win for their candidates. Though formal revamping of new district units was yet to be discussed but this would not pose any problem in canvassing under a single umberalla, he claimed. Though a new party structure was yet to be in place but this was no more an issue, he said. When asked, Badal said he would go alone to the Akal Takht on June 5 as called by the Sikh clergy for 'discussion' on unity issue. Expressing concern over reports of indiscipline in the party, Badal disclosed that nobody would be spared and action would be taken by disciplinary action committee (DAC) to be reconstituted soon. Harping on the alleged excesses committed by the ruling party during previous elections, Badal cautioned the leaders and workers to provide guidance to the prospective candidates for panchayat elections. Though he did not foresee the government's interference as in the past, he, however, cautioned them to take necessary steps like taking help of lawyers in filing nomination papers. The chances of rejection of nomination papers might be less this time as returning officer would be responsible for secrutiny of papers for candidates of every 15 villages as per new indtructions of the state election commission, he said. Badal said that the condition of Tohra has shown definite signs of improvement since all life support appratus have been removed. He visited the ailing leader at Patiala hospital again on Wednesday morning before departing for Alamgir. Due to his condition, it was not proper to talk much, Badal said. Though unity has been achieved in principle but a formal announcement would be made after Tohra recovers. 'Tohra fine'

4,CM brushes aside AP protests on Chitravathi project,"BANGALORE: Brushing aside protests from Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka Chief Minister S M Krishna on Wednesday said the state would go ahead with its Chitravathi project to provide water supply to villages in Kolar district. ""..There is no question of going back whatever be the opposition,"" he said in the wake of objection from Andhra Pradesh whose MPs had met President A P J Abdul Kalam and Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee in Delhi pleading against the project and seeking their intervention. Krishna said Chitravathi project was meant for drinking water purpose and not for irrigation. The state would also explain its position to the President and Prime Minister. ""Should not the state discharge its responsibility of providing drinking water,"" he asked and said the government would not shirk its responsibility. Krishna was speaking after inaugurating the Hudco-funded waste water recycling plant, said to be the country's largest, of the Bangalore Water Supply and Sewage Board at Vrishabhavathy Valley here. Andhra Pradesh MPs had claimed in their memorandum that the construction of anicut across the river Chitravathi near Paradogu in Kolar district by Karnataka was an ""unilateral and illegal action"" which would cause ""untold misery"" to water-starved villages in Ananthpur district of Andhra Pradesh.

5,"Sankeshwar quits BJP, to form new party","HUBLI/BANGALORE: Amidst simmering intra-party differences, Dharwad North BJP MP Vijay Sankeshwar gave a jolt by resigning from primary membership of the outfit on Wednesday. He announced his intention to float a new regional party. However, the state BJP leadership chose to underplay the development by denying it had received any letter from Sankeshwar to this effect. ""He says he likes the party at the Centre, but will start a regional party here. We are unclear if this means a wing of the party,"" state BJP president Basavaraj Patil Sedam told The Times of India. But Sankeshwar told a news conference in Hubli that he handed over his resignation papers to Sedam. ""I have asked to be relieved of the party's primary membership as soon as possible. I am fed up with the party leaders' style of functioning,"" he said. He, however, said he had not resigned from his post as MP as he did not want to cause the expenditure of another bypoll. Sankeshwar said the BJP's central and state leadership was neglecting Karnataka. ""Injustice has been done to party workers and state issues have been ignored. Only a regional party will benefit the state,"" he maintained.

6,Bengal's maiden export policy comes next week,"KOLKATA: In the wake of the Centre's new exim policy, West Bengal industry minister Nirupam Sen will announce the state's first export promotion policy at a summit organised by the CII in Kolkata on June 3. Aimed at promoting exports from eastern India, the summit will be attended by Union industry secretary Deepak Chatterjee, director-general of foreign trade L. Mansingh and commercial representatives from Indian embassies in North African and West Asian countries and envoys from Russia, Japan and Bangladesh. Both chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and Sen are eager to use this opportunity to promote export from West Bengal. ""Our policy will supplement the Centre's new exim policy and facilitate export-oriented industries in special economic zones and other upcoming industrial hubs in the state,"" said state industry secretary Sabyasachi Sen on Wednesday. ""We will stress the logistical, location and infrastructural advantage of West Bengal rather than focusing on the financial incentives,"" he added. The industry secretary further confirmed that representatives from US-based shipping major Peninsular Oriental would meet industry officials and Keventers Agro on June 3 to discuss the construction of a port at Kulpi. The state government wants to speed up the port project, hamstrung by land acquisition and funds crunch, to boost the state's export infrastructure. It has also put pressure on the civil aviation department to declare Bagdogra airport in north Bengal an international airport and ensure its modernisation, claimed officials. The Centre has already sanctioned five agro-export zones in the state to promote the export of fruits and processed fruit products. The state is eager to promote export of IT software, processed food, agrobased goods, leather and jute products, value-added gems, iron and steel and minerals. The industry secretary said the Centre had decided to convert the export processing zone at Falta into a special economic zone and declare the Manikanchan gem park at Salt Lake as the first STZ in the state. ""We will try our best to streamline rules and declare the units there as public utility service to ensure uninterrupted activity. One window service will be provided to the exporters,"" he assured.

7,RLD ministers' resignation accepted,"LUCKNOW: Governor Vishnukant Shastri has accepted the resignation of five Rastriya Lok Dal (RLD) ministers with immediate effect, according to a notification issued by the Chief Ministersâ€™s secretariat on Wednesday.

The ministers are Kaukab Hameed (rural engineering services), Anuradha Choudhary (PWD), Choudhary Babu Lal (minister of state for additional energy sources), Swami Omvesh and Tejpal Singh (both state ministers).

The resignation letters of these ministers were delivered at the chief ministers office on Tuesday evening by an old associate of Ajit Singh, Kartar Singh. However, the officials at the chief ministers secretariat told this correspondent that they were unaware about the receipt of letters by the office. Probably the chief ministers office was waiting for a nod from the chief minister, said spokesman.

The RLD sources, however, said that the letters went to chief ministerâ€™s secretariat straight from Delhi and thus they were unable to say much about it.

The RLD has yet not communicated about withdrawal of support from the Mayawati government.

9,Toxic pesticides found in farm wells,"HYDERABAD: Alarming levels of highly toxic pesticides have been found in water drawn from agricultural wells in some villages of Guntur district. The discovery of the pesticides in the groundwater was made by a team of Central Ground Water Board scientists here in a first of its kind study.

Incidentally, the residues of the pesticides found in the water belong to dichlorodiphenyl trichloroethane (DDT) and benzene hexa chloride (BHC), two banned pesticides.

Many of the villagers, who were quizzed by the CGWB scientists and doctors accompanying them, complained of burning sensation in their stomach after drinking the water. ""Our study found these pesticide residues in agricultural wells in five villages of Guntur district. But the worrisome factor is that banned pesticides are being sold and farmers and farm workers drink this water while at work,"" CGWB regional director M Veeranna said.

The possibility of similar pesticides being found in the drinking water wells in the villages where the study was conducted cannot be ruled out, one of the scientists involved in the study said.

According to Veeranna, Guntur was chosen for the study as the district has the distinction of using the highest amount of pesticide among all districts in the country. Till a few years ago, for every acre of chilli crop, as much as 25 litres or more of pesticide was sprayed, he said.

The CGWB selected five villages that have a history of excessive pesticide usage â€” Bulasapadu, Kambhampadu, Velavanthipadu, Linganuthala and Kummerapadu â€” in Peddakurapadu, Sattenapalli and Amaravati mandals of Guntur district.

While the permitted level of pesticide in groundwater is .001 parts per million, the study found concentrations up to 3.339 PPM in these villages.

Dr P N Rao, a CGWB scientist who led the study, said a survey was conducted among the residents of the five villages and many had complained of burning sensation in the stomach and other ailments after consumption of water from theses wells.

The CGWB, Veeranna said, would this year extend the study to 100 wells in the state and include drinking water wells too.

Asked if high levels of toxic pesticides could be found in the groundwater all over the state, Veeranna did not rule out the possibility. He, however, said that the present study was restricted to agricultural wells and anything could be said with certainty only after a detailed study.

10,Naidu's major sops for farmers,"TIRUPATI/HYDERABAD: In his new welfarist avatar, Chandrababu Naidu continued to reel off sops for yet more sections of the vote bank at the TDP''s Mahanadu in Tirupati.

After unfurling new schemes for women on the opening day of the conclave, he turned his attention to farmers and people of backward areas on Wednesday: 80 lakh farmers will be organised into self-help groups (SHGs) on the lines of Dwcra.

Their brethren in drought-hit areas will be given loan waivers. And Rs 7,000 crore would be spent in the next three years on a development drive in backward areas.

To give shape to all these measures, the government has convened a two-day conference of district collectors on June 9 and 10 to discuss the fine print. Naidu announced his intervention on behalf of farmers during a debate on agriculture policy at the Mahanadu.

Under a new initiative, each farmer SHG would be given micro credit of Rs 2,500 and Rs 15,000 as grant. The money will be useful for poultry, pisciculture, cattle breeding purposes and for purchase of agricultural tools.

Naidu announced that interest would be waived on loans taken from state and district cooperative banks by farmers in drought-hit areas. This would cost the government: Rs 250 crore. The chief minister also agreed to waive penal interest (cost: Rs 94 crore) on crop loans.

In addition, the state government''s share of Rs 100 crore for crop insurance would be released immediately. Four lakh farmers utilising market yards would be given insurance cover of up to Rs 1 lakh in case of death and Rs 50,000 for major injuries.

The CM had something for labourers too: beedi workers would be given 20,000 houses and families of rickshaw pullers would be given Rs 50,000 if the bread-earner dies of unnatural causes (Rs 20,000 in case of natural cause).

On Thursday, Naidu is expected to announce some more schemes: this time weavers, toddy tappers, fishermen and the jobless.

The officials are working out the finer details including the financial burden on the exchequer. Naidu has instructed his peshi officials to be in regular contact with him. Officials hinted at the possibility of reorienting the budget proposals to accommodate the chief minister''s sop spree.

13,With eye on polls Cong to open conclave in J&K,"SRINAGAR: The first ever conclave of Congress chief ministers beginning here on Friday amid tight security is expected to be utilised by party President Sonia Gandhi for greater ""interaction"" on various issues with state leaders ahead of Assembly elections in five states later this year. While the Mount Abu Declaration (November 2002) which talked about providing ""good governance and development"" would be the main theme of the Srinagar meet, Gandhi may also cross-check steps taken by respective governments for the welfare of minorities and other weaker sections. At the beginning of this month, each party government was asked by the AICC to prepare a report on what they had done to fulfil the seven-point programme for the ""welfare and protection"" of minorities announced by Sonia Gandhi in 1999. Besides, the conclave to be attended by 15 party chief ministers, may take up reservation for the poor among the upper castes in the light of 14 per cent reservation offered by the party-ruled government of Rajasthan. Gandhi may also utilise the opportunity to discuss with party leaders the issue of forging electoral tie-ups with like-minded parties in the states where the party was weak. Senior party leader Arjun Singh recently suggested such a tie-up, particularly with Samajwadi Party in Uttar Pradesh, which had generated considerable debate in the party. Party Spokesman S Jaipal Reddy clarified repeatedly that this conclave was not meant to review the performance of party chief ministers at a time when the Congress was deliberating on the strategy for the Assembly elections in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Chattisgarh, Delhi and Mizoram.
