0,Bollywood clones add spice to polls,"RAIPUR: The clones will soon set the Chhattisgarh poll scene ablaze. With the state politics getting murkier by the day, duplicates of stars like Amitabh Bachchan and Govinda are set to provide some comic relief.

The Big B, the Hero No 1, Sunny Deol and Johny Walker â€” you name them and the Congress will roll them out for you. So what if they are not the â€˜real thingâ€™.

Supporters of chief minister Ajit Jogi have already engaged troupes of folk dancers to canvass for the Congress at Marwahi. Huge consignments of dholaks, harmonium and cricket bats have been dispatched to the town from Raipur.

Dance troupes of much sought after Dilip Laheriya and Rajni Rajak are also moving in for the kill. While these parties charge around Rs 7,000 for a dayâ€™s performance, they are raking in the moolah now, with special election rates of Rs 17,000 per day. And going by the records, they are doing quite well. All of them are booked for the next fortnight. The Congress is especially keen to utilise their services in tribal belts like Bilaspur.

Others are performing in the weekly markets in rural areas. Their popularity can be gauged from the fact that one such party performed at Masturi market from 8 pm to 2 am. In all, 22 dance parties have been booked by Congre-ss to campaign in Bilaspur, Surguja and other areas.

Of course, party slogans are part of the performance. Most popular among them: Baasta vikas ka rasta (Education is necessary for development). The performers then urge the people in the local language to press the button on Congress symbol.

3,"Raids, arrests in CAT leak on","PATNA: The CBI on Sunday raided the Patna premises of five persons, including four doctors, suspected to be involved in the leakage of question papers of IIM-CAT. Three of these four doctors were arrested in Delhi on Sunday by the CBI.

The Patna unit of the CBI has constituted five separate teams led by two senior officers to carry out the search operations here following requisition from its Delhi unit.

Although they raided the premises of five persons, they could search the residences of only Dr Suman alias Ranjit Singh of Malahi Pakri area in Kankarbagh Colony, Dr A K Sinha of Lohianagar area in Kankarbagh Colony and Dr Dinesh Singh, a junior doctor of Patna medical college hospital(PMCH) staying in a hostel located near the hospital.

They could not search the premises of one Dr Manoj, located at Govind Mitra Road, and S Chaudhary, located behind A N College, as both the houses were reportedly found locked.The sleuths seized some incriminating documents during the search of the residences of Dr Suman, Dr Sinha and Dr Singh.

Sources in the investigating agency, however, indicated that they failed to get any significant lead in connection with their activities. Sources said that Dr Singh was yet to be arrested by the agency.

The CBI sleuths failed to locate him in Patna. Suman reportedly owns a drug manufacturing firm in Mumbai.

Senior Central Bureau of Investigation officers remained tightlipped about the whole operation, saying the case was being investigated by the Delhi unit of the CBI. No arrests had been made in Patna till late sunday evening.

The search in the premises of both Suman, Sinha and Singh were going on till the time of reporting.

As for the residences of Manoj and Chaudhary, the CBI was left with no option than to them to seal both the houses.

5,Scolded son commits suicide,"RANCHI: What could be more painful for a father than to light the pyre of his son? But Afinder Mahto had to undergo this trauma recently.

When Afinder Mahto of Itki scolded his 18-year-old son on Tuesday for not doing the work given to him, little did he imagine that it would lead his son to commit suicide.

Returning home after the dayâ€™s work in the fields, Afinder and his son Sukhram Mahto had a heated argument even before they had settled down. Afinder had asked his son to meet a certain person, which he did not. Characteristic to a father, Afinder scolded his son, but soon forgot the matter and got busy in his work.

A little while later, he called his son, but there was no reply. Afinder, sensing something wrong, rushed to his sonâ€™s room, which was locked from inside. After knocking several times on the door, Afinder, with the help of his neighbours, broke the ceiling of his sonâ€™s room. There, they found Sukhram lying unconscious on the floor.

Apparently Sukhram had gulped a bottle of pesticides, used for spraying in the fields. Sukhram was rushed to hospital but died on the way. While the family was still mourning, police arrived on the spot on receiving information about the unnatural death. According to police, Afinderâ€™s first wife Risha Devi, who is the mother of Sukhram, accused Afinder of torturing his son and forcing him to commit suicide.

Section 206 of the Indian Penal Code was invoked against the father and an FIR was registered. Afinder was sent to jail.

As the offence was non-bailable, Afinderâ€™s lawyer had a tough time in getting the courtâ€™s permission to enable Afinder to at least lit the pyre of his son.

6,Telgi case: CBI probe may serve political ends,"MUMBAI: Senior police officers as well as bureaucrats here are apprehensive that the Central Bureau of Investigation may not be able to pursue the fake stamp paper scam as vigorously as the special investigative team (SIT) of the Maharashtra police.

In fact, many view the Centreâ€™s bid to hand over the case to the CBI with deep suspicion. â€œThis is a poll year and I am afraid the CBI investigation may be used as a political tool,â€™â€™ said an inspectorgeneral of police who did not wish to be named. He was alluding to the alleged involvement of some top politicians from the BJP as well as the Congress who may have benefited from the racket.

â€œThe CBI could have been brought into the picture long ago. I am doubtful whether the CBI will be able to continue in the same vein as the SIT,â€™â€™ said former Mumbai police chief D.S. Soman.

Home department officials point out that CBI has not made any headway in a case concerning the seizure of fake stamp paper by the Rajkot police station in 1998.

â€œThe Gujarat government had transferred the case to the CBI in 2002 but the investigation is still moving at a snailâ€™s pace,â€™â€™ said a bureaucrat. On the other hand, the SIT has arrested IPS officer Shridhar Wagal for his role in the scam.

Two recent cases show the western zone of the CBI in bad light. In the first case, two employees of the premier investigating agency were arrested for conspiring with an accused in a bank fraud and destroying classified documents related to the case. In the second instance, the Bombay high court had reprimanded the CBI for fabricating legal documents in a case concerning former NCB officer Ajay Ubale.
