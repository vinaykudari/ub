0,Gorakhpur DIG shifted after clashes,"GORAKHPUR: Bowing to the demand of firebrand BJP MP Yogi Adityanath, the Uttar Pradesh government on Tuesday transferred Gorakhpur DIG Jagmohan Singh Yadav in the wake of communal clashes that rocked the city last week.

Adityanath, who had charged the DIG with promoting the interests of the Muslim community and held him responsible for the communal clashes, had withdrawn his call for a bandh in the district on Tuesday and in the entire division on Wednesday following Yadavâ€™s transfer.

The city observed bandh on Monday following a call given by the MP to press his demand for Yadavâ€™s transfer. Yadav had been shifted to the economic offences wing as DIG in Lucknow, sources said.

Meanwhile, Siddharth Priya Srivastava, spokesperson of the Gorakhpur unit of the Congress, said that Adityanath was trying to fan communal passions in the city just to meet his political ends.

Talking to mediapersons here on Tuesday, Srivastava said that few days back trishuls were presented to 800 young men on the Gorakhnath templeâ€™s premises by the BJP MP. This clearly exposed his destructive attitude, he added.

1,Oppn demands Mahant Adityanath's arrest,"LUCKNOW: The Congress joined hands with the Samajwadi Party in the Assembly on Tuesday in criticising the government for its failure to check escalating communal tension in Gorakhpur.

They also demanded immediate arrest of the Hindu Mahasabha MP from the area, Yogi Mahant Adityanath under Pota for his alleged involvement in it.

Agitated on the issue, they were pacified when Speaker Keshari Nath Tripathi directed the government to act tough and take all necessary action to maintain communal harmony in the area. He also asked the government to inform the House about the action taken by it on the matter latest by Wednesday afternoon.

The Speakerâ€™s ruling came after the House witnessed a prolonged adjournment of over one hour on the issue following the bedlam caused by SP members rushing to the well and shouting slogans in protest against the reply of Parliamentary affairs minister, Sukhdev Rajbhar, who assured the members of taking suitable action.

The members also threatened to launch an agitation, if the government did not act soon on the matter. The members stressed on the demand for the arrest of the Mahant, who they described as the main culprit.

Earlier, raising the issue through a point of propriety, Mata Prasad of SP said that Gorakhpur was seething with tension after the recent violent incidents in which Roadways buses and two coaches of Jammu Tawi Express were set on fire. All this had been done at the behest of the Mahant, who had unleased a rein of terror in the area, he said.

He suggested that the powers of the Mahant be checked by converting the Gorakhnath Peeth into a trust and appointing a trustee there on the pattern of the Kashi Vishwanath temple and Tirupati.

Echoing similar views, Congress leaders Pramod Tiwari and Jagdambika Pal said that Gorakhpur incidents were indicative of an evil design of the Mahant, who wanted to foment communal tension in the state by creating a Godhra like situation. They said the people of Gorakhpur, however, deserved to be praised for not committing the mistake of falling in his trap.

They said that if the government did not act against the Mahant, then it was a clear indication that chief minister Mayawati was also hand in glove with the BJP, which had a hidden agenda of plunging the country into a communal chaos.

Expressing concern, leader of opposition Mohammad Azam Khan said the very purpose of Pota would be defeated, if the government did not invoke it against someone like Adityanath who was ready to stoke communal tension for political mileage.

2,Expert doubts govt claim on dolphins,"PATNA: Noted bio-scientist and a senior teacher of Patna University R K Sinha has expressed doubts about the figures quoted by the state government on the increase of Ganga dolphins in the Vikramshila Dolphin sanctuary - the stretch of river Ganga from Farakka in West Bengal to Rajmahal in Jharkhand.

Speaking to the mediapersons on Tuesday, Sinha, popularly known as the Dolphin Man of India, said that the Ganga dolphins were slow in breeding and to know the exact status of their number the entire range had to be surveyed.

â€œI would not like to comment on the number of dolphins until I carry out the survey myself,â€� Sinha remarked.

He said he will most probably start the survey work from next October. â€œThe last time I carried out the survey in the Vikramshila Dolphin sanctuary in 1998, the number of Ganga dolphins was 134,â€� he remarked.

Incidentally, the state government had carried out a survey in the sanctuary with the help of some voluntary organisations and announced that the number of fresh water Ganga dolphins has increased from 150 to 200.

The Patna High Court had last year taken a suo motu action to save the Ganga dolphins â€” now on the verge of extinction. Sinha was asked by the Central government to depose in the case. Sinha had been advocating for sensitising the police on the issue.

Sinha, however, stressed that the intervention of the high court has made a positive impact as police and the forest department have started taking note of the killings of the Ganga dolphins.

â€œThere have been, in my knowledge, at least 12 cases of killings of Ganga Dolphins since October last year. But there are also cases in which action has been taken against fishermen for killing the dolphins. Two months ago in Mokama a chaukidar carrying a dead dolphin on a rickshaw was arrested by the police. Similarly I know about six other cases in which action has been taken against the guilty fishermen,â€� Sinha said.

â€œThe recent police action has instilled a sense of fear in the minds of fishermen who now hesitate in killing a Ganga dolphin,â€� he said and added â€œEven if the number of Ganga dolphins stays where it is now it is a good sign considering the fact that they are among the endangered species.â€�

Incidentally, the Ganga dolphins are killed by fishermen primarily because of an oil which is used to make baits.

3,HC quashes jail minister’s transfer order,"PATNA: The Patna High Court has quashed the order of jail minister Basawan Prasad Bhagat, by which petitioner Shyam Mohan Mishra, superintendent of the Muzaffarpur Central Jail (currently under suspension), had been posted at Masaurhi sub-jail, saying that â€œthe order cannot be sustained in the lawâ€�.

The Establishment Committee (EC) of the home (special) department, headed by home commissioner, who is the competent authority to pass appropriate order in accordance with law for transferring the petitioner, if they so desire, the single bench of Justice S K Singh stated in its recent order (August 12).

The said EC at its meeting held on June 20 had recommended the transfer of the petitioner to the Patna district jail, Phulwarisharif. â€œThe fact to be taken care of is whether the minister on his own can disagree with the recommendation of the Establishment Committee and, if so, whether he can pass the order of transfer, or the same has to be approved by the chief minister or sent back to the EC for a fresh order. Here neither the said transfer has been approved by the chief minister nor has been passed on the recommendation of the EC, before which the matter was sent for reconsideration,â€� said the court order.

Earlier, prisons IG Harjot Kaur, in the counter-affidavit, had stated that the transfer and posting of a jail superintendent is done by the home (special) department and not by inspectorate of prisons. The EC, headed by the home commissioner, of which IG, prisons, is also one of the members, recommends the transfer and posting to the minister of the department, who finally decides the transfer. In the present case, the EC, at its meeting held on June 20, recommended the transfer of the petitioner to Patna district jail, Phulwarisharif, but finally he was posted at Masaurhi sub-jail, the affidavit said.

The court order also says that since the cadre of Central, district and sub-jail is the same and they have the same pay-scale, as such, transfer from one jail to another on the said ground cannot be challenged.

Quoting Paragraph 5 of the counter-affidavit filed by IG, prisons, the court said it has always deprecated earlier making of ad-hoc arrangement for manning any post, and specially in the present case, in spite of the recommendation of the EC, no superintendent has been appointed in Adarsh Jail, Beur, and the same is being manned by a deputy collector, which cannot be appreciated.

The court directed the home commissioner and IG, prisons, to take appropriate steps, so that the aforesaid post is also filled up on regular basis and a regular superintendent is appointed at Adarsh Jail.

4,TDP govt weakening local bodies: Aiyar,"TIRUPATI: Senior Congress leader and member of Panchayat Raj Task Force, Rajiv Gandhi Foundation, Mani Shankar Aiyar criticised the state government for diluting panchayat raj institutions by introducing alternate arrangements for implementing various functions and schemes.

Addressing a seminar on â€˜Panchayat Raj Institutions in India- Real powers and responsibilities,â€™ at Tirupati on Tuesday, he said the TDP government was systematically weakening the local bodies by converting the 3-tier to a 5-tier system and creating parallel centres of administration and denying them due powers and funds.

5,One more car rape incident,"NEW DELHI: A 32-year-old woman was allegedly gang raped in a moving car in south Delhi on Monday night. This is the third such incident in the last one month.

The victim lodged a complaint with the Malviya Nagar police alleging she was raped by 35-year-old Kalkaji resident Sushil Kumar and two of his accomplices.

She told the police while she was waiting at the Khanpur bus stop at about 8 pm, Sushil Kumar and two of his accomplices drove up in a Maruti car and offered her a lift.

â€˜â€˜She says she has a property dispute with the accused and hence knew him. That is why she did not hesitate to take the ride home,â€™â€™ said police.

6,TV to be a tool for farmers,"NEW DELHI: Imagine farmers in isolated areas getting news about the local weather and other details of the crop they are raising on television â€” that too beamed by a television channel in their district.

In fact, all their concerns will be addressed at a programme aired by the district television station.

Sounds too good to be true? Wait till October 13, when narrow-casting television will be on air from 13 centres. If the insistence on â€˜13â€™ reads like a conundrum, it is pertinent to recall that day the NDA government completes three years. Scarred by scams, the government is clearly anxious to give some good news.

Prasar Bharati has begun negotiations with agricultural universities to sign a memorandum of understanding (MoU) for this purpose. Leading research institutions will feed specific areas with the latest information on farming and weather.

â€˜â€˜Narrow-casting television is a new concept in India, it helps beat distance and the socio-economic gap of far-flung areas with technology,â€™â€™ remarks an official in the information and broadcasting ministry. â€˜â€˜Farmers growing cotton will get information on cotton, those raising groundnut will know more about their crop,â€™â€™ he says.

This mode of community-specific, decentralised information through a dedicated channel, experts feel, can take television to the utility age from the present obsession with entertainment.

Interestingly, it comes without any extra expenses on infrastructure. Doordarshan will use its massive terrestrial network to introduce low-range television. Apart from universities, the state governments too will actively participate in the community television programme.

However, the editorial control over content will remain with Prasar Bharati.

7,NPC demands President's rule in Nagaland,"KOHIMA: Nagaland Peoples'' Council (NPC), a regional political party, has demanded imposition of President''s rule before holding the next state Assembly polls contending that free and fair polls were impossible here under the ""autocratic Congress regime led by S C Jamir.""

The prevailing condition in Nagaland was not conductive for free and fair polls, particularly under the dictatorial and autocratic rule of S C Jamir, NPC said in an open letter to Governor Shyamal Datta on Tuesday.

""It is considered pertinent that Nagaland should be brought under the Central rule ahead of the scheduled time for next election to legislative Assembly,"" the letter singed by NPC President Huska Sumi and Secretary General Chuba Temjen said.

The NPC further alleged the ruling Congress under Jamir''s leadership had indulged in booth capturing, used private armies and money power during electioneering since the early 70s.

He alleged that Jamir had indulged in gross mismanagement of public fund as the finance minister since 1994.

The party leaders also urged the Governor to recommend to the Centre for imposition of President''s rule ""so that the people can exercise their franchise and democratic rights in a free environment"".

8,J&K polls meaningless: Kashmiri pandits,"CHANDIGARH: terming the forthcoming polls in Jammu and Kashmir as meaningless, displaced Kashmiri pandits living in the city and parts of Punjab and Haryana allege that the government has done little to ensure their participation in the poll process.

""We are displaced, dispersed, territory-less and exiled people, living a refugee life in our own country, deprived of most important fundamental and human rights. When no government cares for our plight and never bothers to seek our viewpoint on the Kashmir issue, we have decided to boycott the polls, Panun Kashmir Movement''s national coordinator Shivdass Raina said.

For 500 displaced Kashmiri pandits living in the city and aoining township of Mohali, there is nothing substantial in the coming elections, but yes if conducive conditions had been created by the government for our participation we could have given it a thought, says B L Sadhu, president of Kashmiri Sahayak Sabha.

According to Sadhu, the community members have viewed with serious concern the term tarak-e-skunat (voluntary surrender of citizenship), allegedly used by the state bureaucracy for migrants while reviewing the voters list. It exhibits the sinister design of transforming Kashmiri migrants from entity to non-entity of the state.

9,Jain idols ‘thief’ commits suicide,"AGRA: A man wanted by the police in connection with the theft of nine idols and some other artifacts from the Digambar Jain temple at Achhnera township, about 30 km from here, allegedly committed suicide by consuming sleeping pills.

The youth, Rakesh Singh of Bharni village, was found unconscious on Tuesday within the precincts of the Agra civil courts. Though the police admitted him to the district hospital, he died.

A suicide note found in his pocket said he was mentally broken because of the continuous pressure exerted by the police. The note said the night when the theft was committed, he had made other arrangements with a friend.

B.K. Morya, senior superintendent of police, said two other persons taken into custody by the Achhnera police in connection with the idolsâ€™ theft had named Rakesh.When the police went to his house to ascertain the veracity of the allegation, Rakesh escaped through the back door.

Mr Morya said Rakesh had no means of livelihood but had lead a luxurious life. He had been questioned in connection with another theft case earlier but was not prosecuted for want of corroborative evidence.

10,Cong rally hails Bhinder as able leader,"SUJANPUR, Pathankot: If the Amarinder governmentâ€™s drive against corruption was lauded, the threat of resurgent SAD-BJP alliance gaining ground was the cause of concern for the Congress ministers and MLAs gathered at an impressive party rally organised here on Tuesday night at a hotel to project Sukhbans Kaur Bhinder as their â€œleader and to repose faith in herâ€�.

Some of the MLAs feared that shortage of funds for public welfare schemes and lack of cohesiveness in the party unit of the Gurdaspur district might prove counterproductive in eroding the popular party base that the Congress had made by winning 9 out of the 10 seats in the last assembly polls.

Bhinder and Raghu Nath Sahai Puri, urban development and housing minister, came to the rescue of Amarinder whom they called most able and dynamic chief minister.

â€œIt is a transitory phase. Have faith in your chief minister. You need not be pessimistic,â€� said Bhinder. Puri said the Amarinder government was committed to fulfil the promises made in the Congress election manifesto and all sections of the society would be given their due soon.

A note of discontentment was heard at the rally when Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa, former minister and party MLA from Qadian, indulged in plain speaking after several MLAs lauded Bhinder for her able leadership that won Congress nine seats in the assembly elections.

Bajwa said there was no fund with the district administration for public welfare schemes like Shagun, and that there was every possibility of the party workers getting disenchanted. â€œWe should not shut our eyes to the fast changing ground reality.

To retain the popular support we will have to deliver good,â€� added Bajwa. For Sukhjinder Randhwa, MLA from Fateh Garh Churian, the situation was fraught with every possibility of the MLAs and ministers becoming unpopular in the eyes of the public, if they did not devote more time to solve their problems.

Puri, considered to be strong loyalist of both Amarinder and Bhinder and main organiser of the rally, said that the party workers, leaders and ministers were willing to solve the problems. The main hitch, he said, was the financial crunch.

Education minister Khushal Behal warned the SAD leaders that the present government would deal strongly with them if they tried to create any law and order situation. Bhinder said Amarinder enjoyed the full support of the party high command and the confidence of people. She said everybody should come forward to help the chief minister fight corruption and work for speedy development of the state.

11,15% land redistributed in 25 years of LF rule,"KOLKATA: Even after 25 years being in power, West Bengalâ€™s Left Front government has managed to redistribute only about 16 per cent of net arable land in the state.

Admitting this in Kolkata Wednesday, while releasing the report of a study on agrarian reforms in the state the land reforms department, state health minister Surya Kanta Misra said even 15 per cent is not a small figure. This has been proved by international experience.

Besides, the percentage of land redistributed far higher than in other parts of the countryâ€�.

A different study, conducted by the Rural Development Institute, said that out of the net arable land of 13.34 million acres in the state, land vested was 1.28 million acres and the redistributed ceiling surplus land was 1.04 million acres, which was 7.8 per cent arable land.

Besides, land covered by tenancy reforms â€“ Operation Barga â€“ was 1.1 million acres, which was 8.2 per cent of the arable land. Commenting on this report, Misra said â€œIndirectly, 72 per cent of the land was being controlled by small and marginal farmers.â€�

According to the state governmentâ€™s own study, more than 13 per cent of the pattadars in the state had been dispossessed of patta land â€œdue to various reasonsâ€�.

Out of this, about 2.7 per cent of pattadars had sold their plots. â€œThis does not bear out the apprehension that there has been an indiscriminate sale of patta land.â€�

Besides, about 3.02 per cent of bargadars had lost possession over their barga land due to eviction. â€œTo our mind, an incidence of 3.02 per cent of eviction for the whole state, though not high, should cause concern.â€�

Public administration expert Mohit Bhattacharya, who oversaw the preparation of the land reforms department report, expressed concern at sale of patta land and eviction of bargadars. â€œThis should not happen.â€� He agreed that sale of barga and patta land was mainly because of rising land prices and changes in legislation were necessary to take note of this. However, land reforms minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah ruled out any change in barga laws.

The land reforms department report presented a distressing picture of availability of non-land inputs like seeds, fertilizer and bank finance to bargadars and pattadars.

â€œThe emerging scenario is quite distressing. The study shows that a very insignificant segment of the pattadars had received minikit.â€�

Laying stress not â€œon the number of bargadars recordedâ€� but on â€œthe number of recorded bargadars who have acquired a sense of security of tenure,â€� the land reforms department report found â€œquite a significant segment of the bargadars feels secure in respect of their tenure after recording.â€�

12,School teachers court arrest,"KOLKATA: School teachers across West Bengal courted arrest in Kolkata on Wednesday accusing the state government of pursuing an â€œanti-educationâ€� policy.

The teachers, who turned up in scores and blocked traffic on either side of Esplanade in the afternoon, were protesting against the late payment of salaries, the ban on private tuition, the failure of the state to pay pension to thousands of retired teachers and urging the school education minister to fill up more than 32,000 vacant posts in the stateâ€™s numerous schools.

The rally was organised by the Joint Movement Committee of Teachers comprising of the Secondary Teachersâ€™ and Employeesâ€™ Association, Bengal Primary Teachersâ€™ Association, Headmastersâ€™ Association, West Bengal Teachersâ€™ Association and others. â€œWe demand that our salaries be paid on the first day of the monthâ€�, said Ratan Laskar, secretary of STEA.

13,Centre eggs civic bodies to increase revenue,"KOLKATA: The Centre appreciates West Bengalâ€™s efforts to decentralise power to urban local bodies, but is not impressed by the ability of these bodies to generate revenue.

Local authorities, the Centre feels, have â€œcontinuously failed to generate enough revenue for sustaining their developmental programmes.â€�

Union urban development secretary M. Shankar, who was in the city, on Wednesday, conveyed this message to the state government.

Shankar was in the city to deliver the keynote address at a seminar on â€˜Good Urban Governance: Administrative and Financial Reformsâ€™, organised jointly by the state municipal affairs department and the Union urban development ministry.

â€œWest Bengal is way ahead of other states in terms of implementing laws to decentralise power among urban local bodies. However, revenue collection is not so good,â€� he said after the seminar.

Shankar announced a Rs 500 crore Urban Reform Incentive Fund to provide incentives to state governments for pursuing municipal reforms. â€œThe fund will provide incentives for reforms in rent control laws, rationalisation of stamp duty regimes, streamlining approval process for construction of new buildings, revision of municipal laws,â€� he said.

Two other schemes â€” the City Challenge Fund and the Pooled Finance Development Scheme have been set up to provide incentives to urban centres to raise their revenues.

â€œPrivate sector participation is essential to attain self sufficiency. However, private firms wonâ€™t come in unless there are higher tariffs.

This fund will ensure that the level of urban services are maintained even when tariffs are being revised,â€� Union joint secretary PK Pradhan said.

14,Parties all set for elections in J&K,"SRINAGAR/JAMMU: As the Election Commission gets ready to issue notification for the first phase of assembly elections, political parties are deep into the campaign trail.On Tuesday, even as BJP chief Venkaiah Naidu launched election campaign in Kathua and Jammu, the Congress and other parties were busy contemplating likely tie-ups. The separatist groups, too, have their own plan of action to chalk out.With the Hurriyat Conference staying out of polls officially, the possibility of some of its workers participating in polls as Independent candidates has increased manifold, say political observers.North Kashmir will have highest number of Independent candidates, who can pose a threat to the ruling National Conference (NC).There were about 162 Independent candidates in the 1996 polls. But reports indicate that there would be more this time, said a NC worker, on condition of anonymity. Besides the separatists, there is a possibility that a large number of dissidents in the ruling party may contest as Independents as well.In Kupwara and Baramulla, rift had cropped up in the National Conference (NC) over ticket distribution in the last elections. The candidates, who went on to become ministers in Farooq Abdullah government, have been allegedly involved in scams and nepotism.This time, the two districts may witness a large number of dissidents contesting as Independents.People's Democratic Party of Mufti Mohammad Sayeed has decided to enter into poll arrangement with some Independent candidates and the Congress.The BJP, meanwhile, seems to have made up its mind to contest the elections on the plank of discrimination against Jammu and Ladakh.This became clear when BJP chief Venkaiah Naidu declared here that both the NC and the Congress have discriminated against the two regions from the very beginning.While launching the party's poll campaign, Naidu said nobody can dispute the fact that the two regions have been ignored and denied their due in every sphere of life by successive state governments.Whether it was the Congress or the NC which was in power, the two regions never got enough representation in jobs, allocation of developmental funds or for that matter in appointments, he declared.It was the faulty policies of these two parties, which led to the present turmoil. Earlier, party general secretary Rajnath Singh castigated the NC government for denying the Jammuites and Ladakhis their due.Between 1996 and 2002, the number of state government employees rose from 2.5 lakh to 3.6 lakh. Of this, barely 15,000 jobs were provided to people of Jammu. A far smaller portion went to the Ladakhis, he alleged.Singh said his allegation was based on official data, which the party has collected over the past few months to substantiate its claims.
