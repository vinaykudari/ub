4,Bajrang men arrested for disrupting HDMC meet,"hubli: the first general body meeting of the hdmc council on thursday did not go along expected lines, rather, the house witnessed acrimonious scenes. janata party members disrupted proceedings demanding the ""taking back"" of the smt basavamma jigalur kalyan mantap which has been handed over to a madarassa, while bajrang dal activists staged a noisy dharna on the same issue outside. as tempers ran high inside the house, bajrang activists who were seen egging on bjp members, tried to barge into the building. the police immediately swung into action and arrested them. a huge posse of policemen led by deputy commissioners of police t.r. suresh and manjunath annigeri were posted at the hdmc following the gherao announced by the bajrang dal. earlier, as soon as the meeting began, bajrang activists assembled before the hdmc shouting slogans against the mayor and the decision to hand over the kalyan mantap to the madarassa. mayor firdous konnur came down and received the memorandum. he told the activists that the council will not be able to take any decision now as the issue is before the court. to this, the bajrang dal activists urged the bjp members not to allow any proceedings until the transfer of the building is withdrawn. when mayor firdous konnur, after allowing members to discuss issue, gave a ruling that the case is sub judice as it is before the court and could be taken up at the next meet, the bjp members sat in the well of the house. the meeting was adjourned four times and even after five hours, there was no breakthrough. this forced the mayor to suspend the bjp members and call in the marshals to do their duty. bjp corporators ranga baddi and a few others were physically lifted by the marshals and the others walked out. as soon as the council assembled, opposition leader ashok jadhav and ranga baddi raised the issue of the kalyan mantap and sought a discussion on the transfer of the property to the educational institution. the mayor told the members that the proceedings of the house cannot be conducted as demanded by the bjp. this led to heated exchanges with bjp members rushing to the well, reminding the mayor that ""he is a new to the council meeting and should learn respect the members"". when the bjp was unrelenting, the mayor allowed a discussion. jadhav's argument was that the decision to hand over the kalyan mantap property was unilateral and done under political pressure. the hdmc commissioner told the member that after the protest of the bajrang dal recently, the hdmc has written two letters to the government. meanwhile, the previous party to who the building was entrusted has already approached court. the hdmc property under controversy in toravi hakkala was converted into a kalyan mantap on a yearly lease basis since 1995 with an annual rent of rs 28,000 to be paid to the civic body. when the contract ended, the party once again approached the hdmc to make it a three-year contract with an annual rent of rs 18,000, as the leasee had to invest on infrastructure. this was agreed to in 1996 by the council, but it was found that the party had to pay rs 70,000 as dues. it was revealed in the house that the earlier council meets had resolved to rent out the property to some others who could afford to pay the required rent. also, it was revealed that at one of the council meetings of the last council, all members including the bjp had unanimously agreed to hand over the building to a madarassa. however, ashok jadhav did not agree with this and argued that ""the members were misguided by the vested parties when it was tabled before the house."" he also charged that the resolution was passed without the expectance of the finance standing committee. as soon as the house reassembled after lunch, congress floor leader anil kumar patil reminded that the council does not have the local standing to decide as the case is still pending. jadhav shot back stating there is enough provision to discuss the case as it is still at the initial stage in court. he also said that all disputes need not be settled in court alone and it can be rectified without going in for legal recourse. at this point former mayor, pandurang patil agreed that the court is not the only solution to the dispute. this argument can be considered if the party withdraws the case and approaches for a settlement.

5,Eerie silence at Rajkumar's farmhouse,"gajanur: the palatial farmhouse at gajanur is deserted now. twelve months ago, the house was virtually besieged by gun-toting security personnel, curious onlookers and shocked villagers who had seen brigand veerappan in action after a three-year hiatus. now manned by a police officer of the assistant sub-inspector's rank with help from a guard of the tamil nadu constabulary, the farmhouse is hauntingly peopled by vacuum. life in the village is back to quotidian and the people are zealously waiting for the return of kannada superstar rajkumar. but the ghost of july 30 abduction seems to have kept the matinee idol off from the village. shraavanamaasa, an auspicious month in the hindu calendar, sees the rajkumar family pitching camp in its ancestral village and offering prayers at temples. it had been an annual ritual till last year. and this year, the gajanur villagers are greatly disappointed that rajkumar has so far not chosen to keep date with the village deities. sources in the rajkumar family claimed that the ace actor had sought some changes in the house in tune with vaastu. rajkumar has not been able to visit the village as the repair work is still on, they said. rajkumar had spent a gruelling 108 days in the jungle before being set free in november. three others were also kidnapped along with the actor. nagaraj, cousin of rajkumar, is more positive. ``annavru had instructed us to shift household articles from the farmhouse (from where he was kidnapped) to the newly built house. we'll complete this during the shraavanamaasa.'' the new house is bang opposite the farmhouse. ``rajkumar will soon come here and supervise the shifting of house.'' the change in calendar does not hold out any promise for the villagers who very well know that veerappan holds, and continue to hold, both karnataka and tamil nadu governments to ransom and remains elusive. madaiah, a villager, said: ``veerappan still calls the shots from the forest.'' those who had hoped that the special task force will close in on veerappan soon after the release of rajkumar have been let down. the priest of hanuman temple in the village, who had pledged to perform a special pooja on the day rajkumar was set free from the brigand's clutches, is disillusioned. ``i never thought veerappan's arrest will be delayed for so many months. it may never come through now.'' any talk of rajkumar landing in gajanur sends villagers' excitement soaring. and the policemen, who were almost lynched by angry mobs soon after the kidnap, get jittery before flashing a benign smile. but the nightmare of the eponymous farmhouse refuses to fade away.

""on the one hand, the government is talking of encouraging english while on the other, it is destroying english medium schools,"" he observed. recently, congress m p sunil dutt and mla baba siddique of bandra had also opposed the steep hike in fees.
