0,Petition against Vajpayee's election rejected,"lucknow: in a landmark verdict, justice uk dhaon of the allahabad high court sitting at lucknow, while upholding the objections raised by prime minister atal behari vajpayee, rejected the election petition filed against him by hk lal here on thursday as he had no locus standi to file this petition. hk lal, an elector of ranchi, had filed his nomination from lucknow parliamentary constituency in 1999, from where the prime minister was elected. his nomination papers were rejected on the ground that he did not file an affidavit, as required by the election commission, to the effect that he had not been convicted in any offence. the petitioner had contended that he was a duly nominated candidate and was thus entitled to file the election petition and that the directions issued by the election commission neither had the force of law, nor it had the power to make laws under article 324 of the constitution. a preliminary objection was raised on behalf of the prime minister that the petitioner had no locus standi to file the petition as he was not a duly nominated candidate. rn trivedi, additional solicitor general, who appeared as a special counsel for the prime minister, contended that the power of superintendence, direction and control of elections vested in the election commission and it had full jurisdiction, authority and power to supplement the law. trivedi pointed out that the election commission had issued the direction in 1997, which were modified in 1998 in the background of criminalisation of politics after consultation with all the political parties. the directions issued by the election commission were mandatory and binding on the returning officer, trivedi said. the petitioner had strongly placed reliance on the decision in indira gandhi case, in which it was held that for the purposes of section 123 of representation of peoples act (which laid down the disqualification in case of corrupt practices), a person becomes a candidate the moment he files the nomination paper. it was further contended by trivedi that the case of indira gandhi was limited on its own facts where raj narain had alleged that yashpal kapoor, who was a government servant, continued to assist mrs gandhi in the election after she had given herself out as a candidate. it was submitted that the said decision did not apply as many formalities were required to be completed before a person, having filed the nomination paper, could be treated as a duly nominated candidate. they included filing of electoral roll, if a candidate belonged to another constituency as in the present case, filing of a certificate, if one belonged to sc/st category and subscribing to oath under article 84 of the constitution. while accepting the argument, the court held that the decision in indira gandhi's case was limited to corrupt practices only. the court held that the returning officer had to act in a quasi judicial manner and had to examine and decide all objections after enquiry and thus filing of an affidavit was essential. the petitioner's submission that he could file the affidavit even at a belated stage was rejected by the court. the decision is bound to help in eliminating criminalisation in elections and has great significance in view of the assembly elections in several states.

1,UP has no strategy to prevent suicide attacks,"lucknow: with state and central intelligence agencies confirming the presence of four al qaida militants in the state, the republic day this year would come as a `litmus test' for the up police with added security baggage. in the virtual absence of any strategy to pre-empt a suicide attack, the top brass of the state police are now left splitting their hair to chalk out a blue-print to ensure violence free r-day celebrations. ""be it the assassination of rajiv gandhi or the strikes in us and delhi respectively, there was hardly anything that could be done to stop the suicide attacks,"" said a senior police officer to explain that a fidayeen mission just cannot be stopped. ""at best, the impact of such an attack can be checked ... like the security personal did at parliament,"" he said adding that had the suicide squad not been liquidated, the devastation would have been several times more than what happened on december 13. the state police does not have any quick response teams (qrts) to meet an emergency arising out of a suicide attack. ""the state force has only cobra commandos from the provincial arms constabulary (pac) and a better part of its total strength is already deployed on security duty of the vvips like former chief ministers,"" admitted a senior officer. intelligence reports have cautioned that the disputed site at ayodhya, the state assembly and political personalities in lucknow could be the probable targets of the terrorist attacks on january 26. the reports had suggested that possibilities of any such attack at the temples in mathura and varanasi were low as mosques are situated too close to the temples and any major blast would leave both the buildings damaged. lucknow has been put on top of the list with specific `alerts' for r-day celebrations with important installations including the state assembly, chief minister's residence, governor house, offices of unicef, multi-national companies and court buildings as possible targets.

4,Teachers dump students for Master's rally,"pathankot: election fever has caught up with teachers as well, so much so that they took ""leave"" from their respective schools here to attend a function organised by master mohan lal, minister of higher education, the bjp candidate from pathankot constituency as the bjp opened its election office here on wednesday. the congress leaders alleged that academics were ignored when teachers of government senior secondary school and arya school took en mass ""leave"" to attend the bjp function. according to the teachers, they were ""forced"" to attend the bjp function since riwa sharma, mohan lal's wife, was the principal of one of the schools.the bjp circles justified it saying it was well within the rights of every voter to show up to ""cheer their beloved candidate"". master mohan lal, in his speech, even thanked the large number of teachers who had turned up at the function. lashing out at the congress for giving ashok sharma a ticket, mohan lal called him ""the eighth wonder of the world, who contested on a jd ticket, joined the akali dal and has been in the tewari congress"". taking a dig at the congress for ignoring the claims of senior congress leaders, mohan lal, who takes credit for being instrumental in getting college teachers sanctioned grants and pension scheme, exhorted the teachers to join his campaign. a teacher belonging to the opposition, on condition of anonymity, said, ""when they should have been preparing the students for the final exams, the teachers were attending a political rally."" political observers here feel that not only teachers but government employees are prone to bunking duties to attend political rallies as the poll fever catches up with them. posters must carry printer's name: the election commission has asked the chief electoral officer and returning officers to issue instructions to all candidates regarding printing of pamphlets and posters. according to pathankot sdm bhawna garg, every election pamphlet or poster should carry the name and address of the printer and publisher, and a copy of the ""declaration about the identify the publisher, along with a copy of the document"" should be sent to the chief electoral officer of the state or the district magistrate. contravention of the provision was punishable with imprisonment upto six months or with a fine upto rs 2,000 or both. nagar kirtan to mark gurpurb: ranipur central gurdwara singh sabha, on wednesday, took out a massive ""nagar kirtan"" to mark the celebrations of the birth anniversary of guru gobind singh.

5,Panthic Morcha to call for Punjab bandh,"ludhiana: panthic morcha would call for a state-wide bandh regarding the construction of syl canal, sometime in january itself, morcha leader gurcharan singh tohra said at a press conference here, on wednesday. tracing the history of the long-pending dispute, tohra alleged that different chief ministers of punjab had been instrumental in depriving the state of water. he said while some chief ministers had stayed quiet, others had capitulated before the centre, resulting in rajasthan and haryana getting a share of the state's waters. he said the decision to give water to rajasthan was taken by two chief engineers under the patronage of partap singh kairon and jawahar lal nehru, on the understanding that punjab's jats ""would be entitled to go wherever the state's waters went."" however, he said, the rajasthan government had barred residents of other states from buying land, closing the chapter of the 80 lakh acre feet water given to the desert state by punjab. the remaining 70 lakh acre feet of water, he said, had been earlier divided in the ratio of 60:40 between punjab and haryana, but the ratio was later changed to 50:50 under indira gandhi. tohra claimed he had made efforts to make the state's waters stay with it, but darbara singh had withdrawn the writ filed in the supreme court against the decision. he said badal had continued to supply water through nirvana to haryana, hoping that things would settle down gradually but the supreme court, in its decision last year, had allowed the canal to be made. he alleged that badal, realising that this could hurt his party in the forthcoming elections, had tried to pull a few strings in delhi and got the process delayed till november, hoping that the elections would be scheduled by then. but the election commission had refused to hold elections before february, 2002. tohra claimed he had tried to change things for the better during his tenure in the sad government by advising badal to file a writ in the supreme court.

6,Somen lauds govt decision against road blockade,"kolkata: on thursday, west bengal pradesh congress leader somen mitra kept up his tirade against trinamul congress supremo mamata banerjee as he welcomed the recent state government move to arrest those indulging in road blockade in the name of political agitation. speaking to newsmen in kolkata, mitra said that blocking roads and railway lines in the name of political agitation is nothing but harassment of passengers who may be travelling for hours. ""such a thing was not proper. i support the state government initiative to prevent blockades,"" mitra said. incidentally, trinamul has been organising law violation programmes where one of the points is the state government decision on blockages. the party has branded it as a violation of the democratic right of people and also the forfeiture of the right to protest. the position taken by mitra will, no doubt, stoke a debate on the matter. ""the ability to block roads and railway lines in the wake of a fight between local clubs may massage my ego. but it is unfair on the passengers,"" mitra said. if the congress leader was provoking mamata, he was equally critical of the left front government. ""today, the left front is bereft of left ideology today. so they are wooing hindujas today and the world bank tomorrow,"" mitra said, hinting at the recent state government move to rope in the hindujas as a partner in haldia petrochemicals ltd. castigating the cpm, mitra said that the party had come full circle because having led anti-us campaign for so long, cpm leader subhash chakrabarty faced criticism from the party for expressing satisfaction over wtc bombing. meanwhile, pcc president pranab mukherjee has written a letter to railways minister nitish kumar, drawing his attention to the recent move to evict encroachers from railway tracks near dhakuria. nearly 14000 families are likely to be evicted on sunday. in his letter, mukherjee has said that evicting so many people without compensation and rehabilitation will be unfair. mitra added proper rehabilitation must be ensured before making people shelterless.

7,Trinamul takes protest rally to Howrah,"howrah: after kolkata and barasat, it was the turn of howrah on thursday to witness trinamul's jail bharo. thousands of party supporters led by mamata banerjee courted arrest in protest against the mal-administration and corruption unleashed by the ruling left front. launching a fresh attack, banerjee said that the government has failed on all fronts and the hike in hospital charges, college and university fees, electricity tariff are examples of its anti-people nature. unlike the earlier two law-violation programmes, the one in howrah had its anxious moments as party activists started marching towards the mullick fatak jail. a section of the agitators got restive and started to kick the road side fence as buses supposed to take them to the jail were taking too long to return from earlier trips. a melee ensued around 4.30 pm where some trinamul workers were ""injured"". an agitated mamata banerjee instantly staged a sit-in demonstration in front of the dm office, demanding apology from the district administration. the trinamul supremo sat on the middle of the road for nearly 25 minutes, holding up traffic in the area. mamata later castigated the district administration for ""failing to control the mob"". she also alleged that the police had resorted to a lathi charge ""where 22 trinamul activists were badly injured."" howrah sp c.v. muralidhar, however, brushed aside banerjee's allegations. ""the allegation of lathicharge is ridiculous as no such thing was ordered by me,"" he said. adm utpal chanda, however, expressed his regret for the incident and ordered an enquiry. prior to the incident, banerjee addressed a gathering near the dm bunglow. the state government was forcibly abolishing the democratic rights of the people, she said. ""the prohibition imposed by government to hold mass meeting is nothing but an attack on the democratic rights of the people,"" she alleged. mamata banerjee also said that the media now displayed lack of authenticity because the trinamul was being given a bad name for standing beside poor people. ""armed with 11,000 panchayat members, 60 mlas and 9 mps trinamul, the only political party in the state that refused to bow to the left, is capable enough to give a befitting reply for any mischievous attempt by the left front,"" she thundered.

8,Court rules against medical negligence plea,"new delhi: a consumer court recently ruled that a patient cannot claim compensation for medical negligence if he or she fails to follow the doctor's advice on post-operative treatment. the court also said that it is the patient who has to prove that the doctor did not exercise caution or diligence during and after the operation. the court gave this ruling while dismissing an application, filed by a 22-year-old youth alleging that his fingers were deformed due to his doctor's negligence. amit sharma, whose left hand was damaged while operating a machine in a dyeing unit in 1998, had demanded a compensation of rs one lakh from the doctor. the three-judge bench of b p jindal, asha kumar and b prasad said: ``we are inclined to agree with the doctor's arguments that sharma has failed to establish any medical negligence.'' the judgment was based on several orders of the delhi state commission which stated that if a patient has not furnished documents ``indicating negligence in the performance of operation or post-operative care, no case of medical negligence can be made out against a doctor.'' sharma had moved the application after the fingers of his left hand remained deformed despite four operations. ``when i was admitted to the sanwari bai surgical centre in rajinder nagar after the accident, the doctor assured me that an operation would set my fingers right,'' sharma said. fifteen days after the surgery, his hand was operated again. since he did not recuperate completely, sharma claimed the same doctor advised for another operation, 21 days after the second operation. after the fourth operation he was apparently assured that his fingers would become functional once again. but when the stitches were removed, sharma failed to regain use of full use of his left hand. when he approached the nursing home, they allegedly refused to entertain him. the doctor's lawyer, madhukar pandey, refuted sharma's allegations saying the patient had failed to follow the doctor's advice on post-operative care. ``a doctor is negligent if he or she does not proceed according to conventional medical practice which is accepted by medical practitioners,'' pandey said. he informed the bench that sharma did not undergo physiotherapy after the fourth operation. pandey also claimed that the doctor had provided free physiotherapy at his nursing home after the third operation. sharma failed to counter the doctor's claims and was also unable to provide a medical expert's comment to support his contention that the doctor had committed negligence which resulted in deforming his fingers.

17,BSP to go alone in UP polls,"lucknow: the forthcoming uttar pradesh assembly polls would be an acid test for the bahujan samaj party which has decided to enter the electoral fray alone after contesting the last two polls in coalition. the party that had contested the last two successive assembly elections with the samajwadi party and congress would this time be facing the electorate on its own steam. the bsp, confident of facing the electorate alone stems from the fact that it is the only party in the fray that has seen a gradual rise in the voting percentage in its favour since its debut in 1989. from polling 9.33 per cent votes in 1989 to 19.65 per cent in 1996, there has been a rise of over ten per cent votes in its kitty. the party bagged 13 seats out of 373 it contested in 1989, while in 1991 it got 12 seats out of 384. in 1993, the party bagged 67 seats out of 163 it contested in coalition with samajwadi party polling 11.11 per cent votes. in 1996, bsp remained static winning 67 seats out of 296 it contested alongwith congress but percentage wise it jumped to 19.65 per cent. the party also tasted power twice for short durations for four months in 1995 and for six months in 1997, both time with the support of the bjp.

20,HC strikes down provisions preventing increase of rent,"new delhi: giving a major relief to the landlords in the capital, the delhi high court on friday struck down three sections of the delhi rent control act (drca), 1958 which virtually had ""frozen"" the rent of residential and commercial properties since the legisaltion came into force. describing the provisions of section 4, 6 and 9 of the act as ""ultra vires"", a bench comprising justice anil dev singh and justice o p dwivedi in a significate judgement said they ""do not passs the test of reasonableness."" while section 6 permits increase of rent of the old properties for the purpose of expenditure, improvement and any structural alteration, section 4 puts a bar on recovery of any rent excess to the fixed standard rent. section 9 provides that the standard rent has to be fixed by rent controller. stating that these provisions were ""arbitrary and unfair"" to the landlords, the court said they were violative of the constitution as they ""affect landlord's right to livelihood, right to life and avocation"". the court said due to these deficiences in the act, parliament had passed the delhi rent control (amendment) act in 1995, which was sent back to it for reconsideration and is still pending before the legislature. illustrating relation between increase of rent allowed under section 6 of the act and devaluation of rupee since 1939, the court said a house rented out for rs 100 that year would merely fetch rs 229 to a landlord in 1998, while the value of rupee had decreased from rs 38.26 to rs 2.97 during the same period.
