0,The ifs and buts of early elections,"NEW DELHI: Should the Vajpayee Government decide on early Lok Sabha elections, things could fall in place only after a new team takes over at the Election Commission in February. Chief Election Commissioner J M Lyngdoh retires on February 7.

There has been speculation that the government might decide to expand the apex poll body from three to five. But sources in the government say this would require a change in the existing law. Earlier this had been done when the single-member commission was expanded to three.

But there is little time for such an exercise being undertaken at this stage. The April-end-early-May poll schedule for the 14th Lok Sabha rules out a normal Budget Session and the process of passing of the annual Budget. It would have to be a vote-on-account during a brief session that might take place in February.

Dissolving the 13th Lok Sabha could pose a constitutional problem in Andhra Pradesh. Chief minister Naidu, who went in for early dissolution in October, is now the caretaker chief minister, whose term cannot exceed more than six months from the date of the dissolution.

1,UP govt is stable: Mulayam,"LUCKNOW: Chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav on Sunday evaded queries on Rashtriya Kranti Party president Kalyan Singhâ€™s hobnobbing with the BJP. He said he would not dismiss the two RKP ministers.

The Samajwadi Party chief, however, stressed that Kalyanâ€™s moves would in no way impact the coalition government and exhorted his party workers to be prepared for the Lok Sabha polls. Addressing newsmen shortly after holding a meeting with SPâ€™s district office - bearers, Mulayam refused to give a direct reply to any query pertaining to the meeting between Kalyan Singh and Prime Minister Vajpayee. He said the only pressing issue on his mind was UPâ€™s development.

He, however, stressed that those who went against the peopleâ€™s wishes would get a reply from the electorate. He denied that any talks had been held between him and the RKP president following the meeting. To a pointed query on the demand raised by Congress that he dismiss the two RKP ministers, the CM replied that it was not for others to tell him what to do.

He added that he would not do anything which would harm the coalition. Maintaining that his government had the support of all sections of society, he cited the recent victories in the Mahsi and Harora byelections as also in the Vidhan Parishad local bodies polls as proof.

He said development would be the main plank of his party in the Parliamentary polls and did not preclude the possibility of a issue-based pre and post poll understanding with other secular parties barring the BSP. In an apparent reference to to the Congressâ€™s recent talks of coalition politics, Mulayam said he would have to reconsider issue-based understanding with any party which tried to forge an alliance with the BSP.

Mulayam, who would be filing his nomination papers for the Gunnaur assembly seat on January 5, said the constituency formed part of his Sambhal Lok Sabha seat. By contesting from there he had not played foul with the people of his parliamentary constituency. He said only his brother Shivpal Singh Yadav and two ministers would be allowed to campaign there.

He himself would be holding a couple of meetings in the constituency prior to the election. Beginning January 4, he would be holding meetings in various parts of the state. On the issue of Raja Bhaiyya, the CM said following Supreme Courtâ€™s observation, the Centre should release him immediately. Responding to the BJPâ€™s criticism of the Siafai Mahotsav, he said no government money had been spent on the same.

3,Thakre: A distinguished political career,"BHOPAL: Rashtriya Swayam Sewak Sangh stalwart Kushabhau Thakre was the son of Sundarrao Thakre, a physician, and Shanta Bai. He was born at Dhar in Madhya Pradesh on August 15, 1922.

Second of six children, Thakre completed his primary and secondary education in Dhar. After finishing school he took up science at Gwaliorâ€™s Victoria College. His ambition was to become a doctor. However, Kushabhauâ€™s fate had something else in store for him. Instead of purusing medicine, he joined RSS. Kushabhau was only 20. He started off as a party campaigner for the Sangh first in Neemuch and later served the Sangh in Ratlam, which borders Gujarat.

A founder-member of the Bhartiya Jan Sangh, Thakre became BJSâ€™ secretary in south India. In 1956, when Madhya Pradesh was formed, Kushabhau was made secretary (organisation) of the BJS in the state. In 1967, he became the All-India secretary of the BJS with additional responsibilities of Orissa and Gujarat. In 1977, when BJS merged with the Janata Party, Kushabhau became the president of the Madhya Pradesh Janata Party.

He was jailed for 19 months during Emergency and in 1978 he tried his luck at the hustings. He was elected to Lok Sabha from Khandwa constituency. After the BJP was formed in 1980 in Mumbai, Kushabhau became its national secretary and made special in-charge of Gujarat, Orissa and Madhya Pradesh. He remained in the post till 1984. From 1984-86, he was the national vice-president of the BJP.

For the next five years, he functioned as the BJPâ€™s national general secretary and was in-charge of Madhya Pradesh. From 1991 to 1993, he was the party vice-president and in charge of Uttar Pradesh. On April 13, 1998, Kushabhau became the eighth president of the BJP and continued till 2000. He was general secretary (organisation) of the party and in charge of Madhya Pradesh from 1993 to 1998, and again, from 2000 till December 28, 2003.

4,Ram calls for curtailing powers of political bodies,"PUNE: Editor-in-chief of The Hindu, N. Ram, on Sunday said it was time to clip the wings of the political establishment and speakers of legislative bodies as they tended to claim enormous power.

Ram was speaking after presenting the prestigious Punyabhushan award to noted industrialist Rahul Bajaj. Nationalist Congress Party president Sharad Pawar, Rajya Sabha member Suresh Kalmadi, director-general of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research Raghunath Mashelkar, MP Pradeep Rawat, mayor Dipti Chaudhari and former Union minister Mohan Dharia were on the dais.

The award comprises a memento, Rs 1 lakh, a Puneri pagadi and a shawl. Ram said intolerance had started putting pressure on the freedom the Press. â€œThe sky-high powers the legislative bodies need to be inspected,â€� he said. Describing Bajaj as a role model, Ram said he was not just a great captain of the Indian industry, but somebody who had made a profound impact on the values upheld by industrial houses. â€œBajajâ€™s qualities of independence, clear sightedness and straight-forwardness have impressed me the most,â€� he said.

Pawar lamented that not a single industrialist had been elected to the Rajya Sabha, which has representation from every walk of life including art, cinema, science and literature. â€œFor me, the contribution of industrialists is as great as that of freedom fighters, because they strengthened the finances of our country after Independence,â€� he said. Bajaj thanked Puneites and Tridal, the organisation which gives away the award. He announced that the award money would be donated to the Society of Friends of Sassoon Hospital.

Later, speaking on the theme â€˜How to make India greatâ€™, Bajaj said a 10 per cent growth in gross domestic product alone will enable our industries to compete with global players. To achieve the growth, industries will have to be innovative, consumer-centric, honest and will have to learn to reward merit. â€œEven the government needs to respect its people, recognise merit, stop giving free lunches and stay away from dogmas,â€� he said, adding that poor governance and good economic progress never went hand in hand.

Bajaj advised the government to reduce fiscal deficit, non-merit subsidies, red tape, corruption and the losses incurred by electricity boards. He stressed on developing physical, social infrastructure and increasing government funding for it. He also called for improvement in labour policies, which compliment globalisation.

5,Water tankers run riot on city roads,"HYDERABAD: To let tankers carry lifesustaining water to the people, or to impose restrictions on them to put an end to the increasing number of accidents they have been involved in. It a dilemma that the authorities are struggling to resolve.

About 90 per cent of the water tankers supplying water are hired by the HMWSSB on a monthly rental basis after inviting tenders. Most of these are 12 to 15 year old vehicles and are not maintained properly. The private water tanker suppliers ensure that the old vehicles get a fitness certificate and a valid pollution under control (PUC) certificate after replacing old tyres and the battery with new ones, a source said. Once the necessary certificates are obtained, the old parts are put back, he added. With such old vehicles â€” whose road worthiness leaves much in doubt â€” plying the roads, the number of road accidents increase. This has been borne out by the number of deaths involving tankers this past month itself.

For instance, on December 3, 10-year-old Zoha Banu was crushed to death by a water tanker at Shahalibanda. On December 8, 12-year-old M Yadagiri was hit by a tanker while riding a bicycle near the Ramoji Film City. Four-year-old S Yellander and a two-and-half-year old kid also fell victim to tankers.

But sources offer a justification. The amount offered by HMWSSB for these tanker suppliers has to be reasonable so that they can be asked to provide better vehicles for supplying water, he said.

Worse still, the 60 tankers that belong to the HMWSSB too do not have valid PUC or vehicle fitness certificates, and the authorities do not bother themselves over these. The enforcement agencies are aware of the violations but are forced to take a lenient stance. For, if they ground these vehicles, it is bound to affect water supply to scarcity-hit areas.

""We have reminded the HMWSSB authorities to get the vehicle fitness certificate renewed and to obtain a valid PUC certificate but our reminders fall on deaf ears,â€� regional transport officials say. Still, it is embarrassing to take action for it would result in the delay of water supply to water shortage areas. If such vehicles are stopped, the sufferers are always the common people, they say.

6,Sharma rules out change in UPCC leadership,"LUCKNOW: AICC general secretary Newal Kishore Sharma on Sunday outrightly denied the possibility of any change of UPCC chief Jagdambika Pal and said that no such proposal was under consideration at present.

Talking to Times News Network, Sharma who is also an in charge of the partyâ€™s UP affairs, said the Congress leadership was concerned with revitalising the organisation by injecting a new blood into it. And this would be done by way of toning up the party units at state as well as district levels.

He did not rule out the inclusion of some new office-bearers in the UPCC but he ruled out any change in the state leadership of the Congress. When drawn his attention towards the bickerings within the party, he said it was no cause of any worry, although he admitted that it was not good for the party. The party, he said, was very much concerned with the issue and would shortly take necessary steps to check it. The immediate challenge before the Congress, he said, was to gear up its rank and file at grass-root level and make them ready for the forthcoming Lok Sabha polls.

â€œWe are in a hurry to rejuvenate the organisational set-up in view of the Lok Sabha polls, which are likely to be held sometime by April end or May first week,â€� Kishore said. Downplaying the Congress defeat in the recent assembly polls in MP, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh, he said it was no indication for the Lok Sabha polls. The people, he said, were intelligent and conscious enough about national issues. Asked about the possibility of any poll alliance by the Congress in the state, he said: â€œThe issue is wide open before the party and an appropriate decision will be taken in this regard at the right time.â€�

However, he was evasive on the issue of continuance of the outside support extended by the Congress to the Mulayam Singh-led coalition government and said so far there was no hurry to change the party stand. The Congress had decided to support the Yadav government in the larger interest of the state and it would continue to do so as long as the peopleâ€™s interest was upheld by it. On the recent political development in which RKP president Kalyan Singh is believed to be on the verge of severing his ties with Yadav and inching towards the BJP, after his recent meeting with Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, he said, the Congress was closely watching the issue.

â€œEssentially, it is Yadavâ€™s problem and not of the Congress,â€� he added. But, he said, UP was politically crucial and so its importance could not be underestimated in the context of the national political scene. The Congress was keen to widen its support base and the potential was there, provided the party was able to reach the people and convince them about its strength, Kishore added.

8,Pak had cleared suicide bomber,"ISLAMABAD: A hardcore Jaish militant, identified as one of the suspected suicide bombers who tried to assassinate President Pervez Musharraf, had been released from prison in Afghanistan and was later cleared by Pakistani security agencies for good conduct.

Jameel, 23, was captured by Afghan security forces in an injured condition soon after the ouster of Taliban and was handed over to Pakistan security forces along with 29 other militants. He was declared ""white"" by Pakistani security agencies and was cleared after questioning by Joint Interrogation Team (JIT) in April last year.

The JIT had concluded that the suspect was not involved in any anti-state activities and nothing adverse had been found against him, local daily The Dawn reported.

Jameel, hailing from Torarh in PoK, had attended militant training camps in Rishkore near Kabul when Taliban was in power and was actively involved in carrying out several terrorist attacks in Jammu and Kashmir, it said.

He was identified two days ago after police found his damaged face at the site of the December 25 attack on Musharraf in Rawalpindi.

The other suicide bomber has been identified as an Afghan from the ranks of the jehadi groups active in the North West Frontier Province.
