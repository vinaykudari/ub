4,New party a setback for Ranjan,"patna: the formation of the indian federation of democratic party (ifdp) is being perceived as a setback for former rjd working president ranjan prasad yadav. controversial mp anwarul haque, who was a key member of ranjan's rjd (democratic), has been named as the ifdp president. another rjd (democratic) mp sukhdev paswan and independent mp pappu yadav have also announced their alliance with the new party along with three more lok sabha mps. however, ranjan's former associates are yet to renounce him in clear-cut terms. ""we hope that ranjan yadav and nagmaniji will join the new party soon,"" stated abhiram pandey, a close confidant of anwarul, while stressing that the ifdp was formed because the rjd(d) was not at all functioning as a political party. ""ranjanji gayab ho gaye the (ranjan had disappeared). wey to hawaijahaj ke neta nikle,"" remarked pandey. he said anwarul was the natural choice as president for the new party because of his ""aggressive"" style of functioning. pappu and anwarul supporters insist that the ifdp will be soft towards the nda and extend its ""critical support"" to the vajpayee government. ""however, we are dead against (rjd chief) laloo,"" one of them maintained. they expressed the confidence that ranjan and nagmani would join the new party as the relations between ranjan and laloo have reached the point of no return. ranjan is tightlipped about the development. his followers, however, insist that the development has taken place due to ""strategic reasons"". ""they (anwarul and other mps) have formed a group in the lok sabha,"" said a ranjan follower while pointing out that the speaker of the house is yet to dispose of the petition for granting recognition to the rjd(d) in parliament. ranjan is yet to move the election commission for recognition of the rjd(d) as a political party. they stress that anwarul, sukhdev and pappu are still ""hardcore ranjan supporters"". regarding the enigmatic silence of ranjan after his abortive move to destabilise the rabri devi government, his followers say the media hype only backfired on them. ""when the samata party came into existence, 14 mps left the janata dal. nobody had an inkling of the development,"" an mp remarked while stressing that the ""remove rjd"" campaign will have to be carried out the way chandrababu naidu removed his father-in-law n t rama rao from the post of andhra pradesh cm. however, ranjan's policy of ""golden silence"" is making his followers restless. ""we have waited long for ranjan to launch an offensive against laloo. but we find him elusive and reluctant to launch an all-out crusade against the present regime,"" stated a dissident rjd leader while maintaining that there are still quite a few mlas waiting for the ""right opportunity"" to strike.

6,"Jharkhand minister, chief secy invite HC's wrath","ranchi: jharkhand energy minister lalchand mahto and chief secretary v s dubey have seemingly invited trouble for themselves by going to the press with statements in connection with a public interest litigation (pil) filed in the jharkhand high court by one, arbind kumar roy, pertaining to appointments of chairman and members of the jharkhand state electricity board (cwjc-924 of 2001). a division bench of the high court comprising chief justice v k gupta and justice m y eqbal on tuesday sought the opinion of the minister's counsel debi prasad whether it should start suo moto proceedings for contempt of court against the minister for having held a press conference regarding the matter even as the case was sub-judice. the case took a significant turn when the minister's counsel informed the court that chief secretary dubey too had given statements to the press regarding the case. while seeking details of dubey's statement to the media, the division bench observed if the chief secretary has made such a statement, it was ten times more heinous since he should be aware of the rules. the court directed the counsel to produce the newspaper clippings regarding the statement of dubey before the court on wednesday, and if the case was found to be fit for contempt, notices would be served to both the minister and the chief secretary. the court asked the counsel will the minister never learn? already a convicted contemnor, is he holding a trial by media? how many examples have there been when a public functionary goes to the press in a matter which was actively sub-judice? the court asked the counsel and added that if the system allowed this to happen, it would become difficult for the court to function. the energy minister had earlier been found guilty of contempt of court following which he had tendered an apology for having written to the chief justice to dispose off a matter related to usha beltron. in this case too, soon after the minister had filed a reply to the affidavit filed by the energy secretary on behalf of the state, the minister had held a press conference to clarify his stand.
