0,Mayawati inducts 56 ministers,"LUCKNOW: Chief Minister Mayawati expanded her five-month-old ministry from 23 to 79 here on Friday. But while she did that, there were rumblings in the coalition partner, Bharatiya Janata Party. So much so that the CM had to clear the air of even the slightest doubt about her government. She ruled out any threat to it no matter how displeased the rank and file of BJP was after the expansion. She also did not think that there was the need for another expansion.

Although the CM described the ministry making as a balancing act, the Independents and MLCs, except one from the BSP, were ignored.

Many senior BJP leaders, like NKS Gaur, Nepal Singh and Harish Chandra Srivastava were also not considered. Also, noteworthy were the missing names of those close to former chief minister, Rajnath Singh.

There were nine Thakurs, eight Brahmins, three Muslims and a same number of women among the total 42 new faces in the 56 inducted today. Allahabad and Lucknow did not figure in the new list at all.

The exercise of distribution of portfolios seemed to have upset a section of the BJP. Two of its MLAs made light of the their displeasure, and a meeting was being convened by some disgruntled legislators.

The situation took a turn for the worse when Lallu Singh, who was being offered the portfolio of minister of state (MoS), refused to take oath which was administered by governor, Vishnu Kant Shastri at the Raj Bhawan.

What annoyed Lallu apparently was that he himself was being given a state ministerâ€™s status while first-timers like Ameeta Singh was being given independent charge. Lallu was MoS in previous governments headed by Kalyan Singh, Ram Prakash Gupta and Rajnath Singh.

There were protests from other quarters within the party. Ganga Bux Singh reportedly threatened to resign in protest for not being given a ministerial berth.

The number of disgruntled BJP MLAs is rising and they have planned to hold secret meetings along with Independents, who had also been denied ministerial berths to chalk out their future course of action.

â€œThe development does not augur well for BJP,â€� admitted a senior party leader. He put the blame squarely on urban development minister, Lalji Tandon, who by virtue of being leader of the BJP legislature party was given the responsibility of preparing the list.

Tandon was the most harried man. He remained closeted with state BJP chief, Vinay Katiyar and Kalraj Mishra, partyâ€™s incharge of the political affairs in the state at a marathon meeting at his Mall Avenue residence.

In all 56 new ministers were inducted. The composition is: 25 BSP, 24 BJP, four Lok Dal and two Loktantrik Congress Party.

And with this, there are 30 cabinet ministers, 15 each from the BSP and the BJP, 20 MoS with independent charges, 10 each of BSP and the BJP and 29 MoS, 15 of BJP and its allies and 14 from the BSP.

1,Muslims protest Falwell’s remarks about Prophet,"MUMBAI: Leaders of the Muslim community met chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh on Friday to protest against the recent remarks reportedly made by Baptist minister Jerry Falwell against Prophet Mohammed in a television interview on CNBC.

According to general secretary of the Raza Academy, Mohammed Saeed Noori, the minister had called the Prophet a terrorist, outraging Muslims across the world. â€œMr Deshmukh condemned Mr Falwelâ€™s statement and promised to convey our demand to initiate action against such verbal terrorism to the American consul general Angus Simmons,â€™â€™ Mr Noori told TNN.

â€œWe feel that Mr Falwellâ€™s statement is a part of a well-conceived plan by the George Bush-led US government to test the patience of the Muslim community,â€™â€™ Mr Noori said. â€œWe call upon the US government to take stern action against the erring priest and demonstrate that they reject his views,â€™â€™ he added. Muslim organisations led by the Raza Academy had called for a bandh of Muslim establishments on Friday and planned to lead a morcha to the American Consulate at Breach Candy.

However, the morcha was stopped enroute by the police, fearing a law and order problem. Thousands of people responded to the community leadersâ€™ call for a bandh. The otherwise bustling districts of Crawford Market, Mohammed Ali Road, Mazgaon, Dongri, Mahim, Kherwadi, Jogeshwari, Shivaji Nagar in Govandi wore a deserted look. At 3 pm, people gathered at Minara Masjid off Mohammed Ali Road to participate in the morcha. A sea of bobbing skull caps meandered along the arterial road,shouting slogans and condemning Mr Falwellâ€™s statement. It threw traffic out of gear.

At J.J. Marg police station police vans blocked their path. The crowd marched right into the police station, where imams of various masjids across the city held talks with senior police officers. The tense situation was resolved only after Mr Deshmukh agreed to meet a delegation of Muslim leaders. Other organisations supporting the bandh included All India Sunni Jamiatul Ulema and Tanzeem Wali-e-Asr.

3,Cong blames govt for hike in cement prices,"HYDERABAD: Expressing concern over the spiralling rise in cement prices in the state, the Andhra Pradesh Congress Committee (APCC) on Friday demanded that the government should take steps to control the price rise which was hitting the construction industry severely.

Speaking to reporters, APCC K Rosaiah said: ""With the blessings of the government, which seems to have entered into a secret understanding with the cement manufacturing firms, cartels are being formed and prices increased by creating an artificial scarcity. â€�

He said that despite being in the number one position in manufacturing cement, the people of AP were paying abnormal prices for it.

He accused the government of not taking any steps to check the rising prices and said ""the government remains indifferent saying that it has no control over the issue, which falls under the purview of the central government.""

4,Poor laddu quality at Tirumala irks minister,"TIRUMALA: Endowments minister D Sivaramaraju on Thursday expressed concern over the deterioration in the quality of Srivari Prasadam, the laddu, at Lord Venkateswara temple in Tirumala.

The minister, during his surprise inspection at Tirumala on Thursday, found fault with the TTD for the poor quality of the laddu. â€œThe faith with which devotees purchase laddus should be taken into account and maximum priority should be given to quality. The TTD should not hesitate even if it comes to spending a few crores for maintaining high quality,â€� he said.

Talking to reporters, the minister expressed dissatisfaction over the purchase of poor quality ingredients â€” particularly cardamoms used in the preparation of laddus.

5,Awareness campaign against quota policy,"JAMSHEDPUR: The Jharkhand Disom Party (JDP) here on Thursday launched its awareness campaign to mobilise support against the Jharkhand governmentâ€™s new reservation quota for various categories of beneficiaries. Hundreds of JDP workers, led by party president Sumitra Murmu, went on a door-to-door campaign in the tribal-dominated areas in and around the Steel City.

The party is demanding higher reservation for adivasis. The Steel City had a few months ago witnessed a bloody clash between adivasis and the non-adivais on the reservation and domicile issues. Five persons had also died during agitation on the issue in Ranchi.

The JDP leaders say the aim of their campaign is to make the largely ignorant tribals aware of how the Jharkhand government has betrayed them. â€œChief minister Babulal Marandi has compromised on the interests of the tribal populace,â€� they maintained. The government had to revise the quota for different groups following the Jharkhand High Courtâ€™s decision to limit reservation of jobs to 50 per cent. The quota for SC has been reduced to 26 per cent from 32 per cent.

The SC and OBC now have 10 per cent and 14 per cent reservation respectively, against the earlier quota of 14 per cent and 27 per cent. Marandi has also come under attack from leaders of his own party. â€œThe new quota regime is unconstitutional and undemocratic. It should have been worked out on the basis of population,â€� former BJP MP Shailendra Mahato said, adding that he would move the court against the governmentâ€™s decision. â€œThe adivasis and Dalits constitute 27 and 11 per cent of the total population,â€� he said. â€œThe government doesnâ€™t appear to be serious on the issue.

It is just playing with the sentiments of the people.â€� Even BJPâ€™s alliance partners are unhappy with the revised reservation quota. Three senior ministers from Samata Party and Janata Dal (United) had stormed out of the cabinet meeting on the issue.

6,Cauvery row: Split in ranks cloud artistes' rally,"CHENNAI: Over 5,000 members of the Tamil film industry, including leading stars, left here for Neyveli on Saturday morning in a convoy of buses for the protest rally over Cauvery issue, but fresh divisions within the ranks appear to have dampened the spirit of the artistes.

Though the industry, which closed its ranks just the other day after much wrangling over the nature and venue of the protest, put up a show of unity, an interview given by film director Bharatiraja, the first to call the agitation, to a daily attacking DMK President M Karunanidhi and superstar Rajnikant evoked strong criticism.

The rallyists, under the banner of South Indian Film Artistes Association (SIFAA), left in 140 buses from different venues amidst tight security cover. Virtually everyone from the Tamil tinsel world turned up for the grand show in Neyveli on Saturday afternoon.

While Rajnikant has opted out of the rally, chosing to stage a fast here on Sunday, the other leading star Kamal Hassan is expected to join the rallyists later.

SIFAA General Secretary and DMK MP Sarath Kumar condemned Bharatiraja''s interview and expressed fresh reservations about the whole protest, but said they were proceeding to Neyveli as planned because the rally was for a good cause and they wanted to present a picture of unity.

Talking to reporters, he questioned the need to hold the rally at a far-off place like Neyveli, about 150 km from here, and termed as ""an individual''s"" decision the move to stage the protest demanding that power supply to Karnataka be stopped till that state released Cauvey water to Tamil Nadu.

Bharatiraja, who was also present, however, did not speak to reporters but boarded a bus for the venue.

SIFAA President Vijaykant said the artistes were fighting for a cause and the protest was an expression of solidarity with the farmers of the state.

Vijaykant, who had a hard time in organising the convoys, pleaded ignorance about Bharatiraja''s interview.

Film director and former DMK MLA T Rajender pulled out of the protest at the last minute, expressing displeasure over the arrangements, while popular heroine Radhika stayed back citing ""indisposition"".

In the interview to the English daily, Bharatiraja suspected a deal between Rajnikant and Karnataka Chief Minister S M Krishna and defended his decision not to call on Karunanidhi. ""Who is he. Can he provide security to us. Why should we call on him,"" he was quoted as saying.

The actors and other members of the film industry started arriving at the association premises right from 6.00 a.m. Notable among those present on the occasion were leading heroes Ajit, Karthik, Murali and Prasanth and heroines Simran and Jothika, comedians S S Chandran, MP, and Manorama.

Police had made elaborate security arrangements at the premises and along the arterial Grand Southern Trunk Road, through which the convoy traversed.

The rally ran into problems soon after Bharatiraja announced the decision a week after Kannada film stars staged a protest in Bangalore against release of Cauvery water.

With Rajnikant coming out against the nature of the protest and the venue and announcing a parallel fast, the industry appeared heading for a vertical split, but timely intervention by Vijaykant saw the actors closing ranks on Friday night.

7,Hurriyat contests PM's statement on J&K polls,"SRINAGAR: Contesting the Prime Minister''s statement that the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly polls were a vote for unity and integrity of India, the Hurriyat Conference, an amalgam of 23 separatist outfits, on Saturday said the people had voted in anger against the incumbent government and India.

""We contest Prime Minister''s claim that it was a vote for unity and integrity of India. The people voted in anger against the incumbent government and India,"" Hurriyat chairman Abdul Gani Bhat told reporters here.

""It was an anti-incumbency vote to some extent but people largely voted against excesses of security forces,"" he said

Bhat said said the victory of the People'' Democratic Party showed that the Kashmir issue was yet to be resolved.

PDP leader Mufti Mohammad Sayeed and even National Conference president Omar Abdullah had reportedly said the polls would not resolve the Kashmir issue, he said.

Bhat said the elections should not be construed as an alternative to plebiscite.

He, however, added ""now, if a plebiscite is not workable for some reason, then let there be a dialogue involving India, Pakistan and the Hurriyat Conference.""

""Let the world see that the Hurriyat can contribute in resolving the issue which holds the key to peace and stability in the South Asian region,"" Bhat said.

8,Centre says will extend full support to new govt in J&K,"HYDERABAD: Asserting that NDA government''s performance was ''not under scrutiny'' in Jammu and Kashmir elections, the BJP on Saturday said the Centre would extend full co-operation to the new state government for tackling the menace of terrorism.

""We are not perturbed over the poll outcome there. It was a reflection of anti-incumbency factor working against National Conference government"", BJP President M Venkaiah Naidu told reporters here.

Admitting that his party suffered setback on account of its alliance with Jammu State Morcha (JSM) in Jammu region indirectly benefitting Congress, he said, ""Another reason was that we (BJP) were co-operating with the National Conference at the Centre but operating against each other in the state"".

A meeting of the BJP''s national office-bearers, scheduled to be held in Mumbai on Oct 20, would analyse the poll results, Naidu said.

Asked about the growing rift between BJP and Sangh Parivar outfits like VHP and RSS, he said, ""We are concerned about all Indians, irrespective of their religion, caste or creed. We are not confined to one particular religion"".

Naidu dubbed as ''absurd'' the criticism that religious intolerance was on the rise ever since NDA took over the reins.

""There is no intolerance. No discrimination on religious grounds. On the other hand, we are keeping the interests of all communities in mind"", Naidu said. Copyrights and Trademark with Niti Telecom Consultancy All rights reserved.

9,KAT order on civil service selection list set aside,"BANGALORE: The Karnataka High Court on Friday allowed in part the writ petitions filed by Karnataka Public Service Commission (KPSC), and set aside the Karnataka Administrative Tribunal (KAT) order nullifying the selection list notified by KPSC for appointment of gazetted A and B posts in the state civil service.

Justice R.V. Raveendran and Justice K.L. Manjunath on Friday partly allowed the writ petitions and directed the KPSC to redo the selection on the basis of moderation of marks and revaluation of answerscripts of candidates in the competitive exam held for the selection. The bench set detailed guidelines for the same.

On March 9, 1998, the KPSC notified 415 posts of gazetted A and B posts in the the state civil service and invited applications from candidates. Thereafter, it held a competitive exam and finally published the list of selected candidates on September 28, 2001.

K. Linganna and other unsuccessful candidates questioned the legality and propriety of the selections before the High Court in writ petitions, and they were transferred to KAT for disposal. The KAT, after a hearing, allowed the applications on February 2, 2002, and quashed the list, directing KPSC to redo the list after revaluation of answer scripts.

The KPSC and some of the selected candidates challenged the KAT order in the HC, contending that the direction to revalue answer scripts was illegal and that the selected candidates were not made parties before the KAT and no opportunity was afforded to before the tribunal.

The principal opposition to the selection was that valuation was illegal and irregular. For instance, the petitioners alleged that four top ranks were given to the members of one family.

After discussion, the Bench set guidelines to redo the selection. The court said the KAT secretary has to moderate on the subjects listed in the judgment on a two-tier system selecting examiners for the purpose, as per the memo submitted to the court on March 27, 2002, and thereafter notify selections as per law.

12,Farmers protest Krishna's rally in Mandya,"MANDYA: There was slight tension before Chief Minister S.M. Krishna''s rally on Saturday when Mandya Zilla Raitha Hitharakshana Samithi members threw stones, slippers and tomatoes on Congress workers participating in the padyatra.

The members waved black flags and shouted anti-Krishna slogans. Attempts by Congress MLA M.S. Atmananda, municipal president T.L. Purushotham and former legislator G.B. Shivakumar to control the protesters were futile. The performers'' roupes which had been eagerly waiting to present the cultural show, had to literally run to escape the agitators'' wrath.

Krishna made a grand entry at the Sir M.V. Stadium, venue of the meeting, amid tight security.

Atmananda, who has been supporting former MP G. Made Gowda on the Cauvery issue, did not attend the rally, but was seen on a scooter nearby.

Krishna, who has been refusing to join issue with the opposition, in particular former PM H.D. Deve Gowda''s barbs at his padyatra, chose to keep politics away from his speech too. But a book distributed at the rally, Deve Gowdara niluvu-andu-indu, (Deve Gowda''s stand on Cauvery row, then and now) said everything.

Despite the downpour, the crowd did not budge and heard the speakers in rapt attention. Krishna''s wife Prema was seen going around in the rain overseeing arrangements made for the rally.

Traffic hit for 10 hours: If the Mandya farmers'' agitation paralysed traffic between Bangalore-Mysore for a month, the rally resulted in a hold-up for over 10 hours.

15,Dandiyas may clash later into the night,"MUMBAI: With three nights to go before the dandiyas stop clicking,Navratri organisers still are pushing for the 10 p.m. deadline to be extended. They have obtained a notification from the environment ministry empowering the state government to extend the time limit. Deputy chief minister Chhagan Bhujbal said that the government would take a decision on Sunday.

â€œThe environment department will study the notification carefully and only then will we take the next step,â€™â€™ he told TNN. It is learnt that the government from Sunday is likely to extend the deadline for the Navratri festivities to midnight. The notification by the environment ministry on Friday states that the Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2000, have been amended to include a subrule.

This empowers state governments to extend the 10 pm deadline for loudspeakers during cultural and religious festive occasion for a period not exceeding 15 days. â€œThis 15-day ceiling is once again going to pose a problem for us as the different communities will want us to give them preference.

He added that the government will have to frame a comprehensive plan cater to various communities. Navratri organisers now are sitting tight and watching the governmentâ€™s moves. â€œThe ball is in the governmentâ€™s court. they care for the people then they will respect their sentiments and allow them play dandiya till midnight,â€™â€™ said spokesperson of Sankalp, one of the largest Navratri organisers in the city. The anti-noise-pollution activists are upset with this development.

â€œHow can the government amend the rules without consulting the public. This is in complete violation to the Supreme Court ruling on noise pollution,â€™â€™ Dr Yeshwant Oke on the Anti-Noise Pollution Committee said. It is learnt that Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi rallied for the notification to be issued. As soon as the notification came through, the Modi government permitted loudspeakers to blare till midnight in Gujarat.

â€˜â€˜Why there was a reaction to Mr Falwelâ€™s statement only in Maharashtra?,â€™â€™ he asked and alleged that certain fundamentalist elements were instigating communal trouble in the state.

He blamed the Democratic Front (DF) government for its failure to curb the violence.

He said during the three years of DF rule the state witnessed as many as 52 communal riots.

There are indications are that the director-general of police Subhash Malhotra may be removed for the repeated failure of the police to check communal violence in the city.
