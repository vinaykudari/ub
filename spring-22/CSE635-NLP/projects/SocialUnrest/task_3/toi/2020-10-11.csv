The accused were allegedly involved in a fight with some passengers at the Holambi Kalan railway station. They were allegedly forcing the railway staff to take the train back there as they wanted the passengers there to be booked.

2,Constable's suicide note names DGP Malik,"PANCHKULA: The suicide by Haryana police head constable Jaiveer Singh Rana in the ''malkhana'' of the Sector 5 police station on Friday night has kicked off a major controversy with a suicide note found on his person holding Haryana police chief M S Malik and six others responsible for his death.

Malik could not be contacted for comments despite repeated attempts.

Besides DGP Malik, others named in the suicide note are assistant inspector general of police (welfare) M S Malik, Navdeep Singh Virk, a Haryana IPS officer posted with the Centre, DSP Jagwant Lamba, head constable Raj Pal, Ambala-based property dealer Hardeep Singh Jaggi and Yamunanagar SP''s reader Mehar Singh.

3,BJP woos lawyers at conference,"MUMBAI: Bharatiya Janata Party state president Gopinath Munde has appealed to the legislature and the legal community to highlight the difficulties faced by the less fortunate sections of society.

Inaugurating a daylong All Maharashtra Lawyersâ€™ Conference at Mulund on Saturday, Munde said the responsibility of lawyers had increased, especially in view of the falling standards of the judiciary and the legislature.

He urged lawyers to mobilise public opinion against the present Democratic Front (DF) regime in the state.

â€œOnce the BJP-Shiv Sena alliance takes over the governance of the state, provision would be made to extend soft loans up to Rs 2,00,000 to fresh law graduates for setting up offices,â€� he announced to the delight of over 900 lawyers, who had arrived from different parts of the state to attend the conference, which was organised by the BJPâ€™s legal cell.

Asking the lawyers to create a public opinion favourable for a common civil code, he said efforts should be made to conduct court proceedings in local languages so that the litigants could understand what was going on.

Munde said the main job of a legislature was to make legislation. However, over the past couple of decades, this was not being done.

While storming the Well of the House and walkouts were consuming considerable time, no time was left for making the laws. There have been persistent demands that the legislatures should sit for a minimum of 100 days every year.

This was not being followed. Maharashtra was better placed as its legislature held sessions for 45 days this year. In some states, sessions never exceeded even a week, he observed.

4,JP’s thoughts will be included in syllabus: CM,"PATNA: Emergence of leaders who have good moral values would be the best tribute to Lok Nayak Jaiprakash Narayan, said governor M Rama Jois.

He was delivering a lecture on JP anniversary on Saturday at the Mahila Charkha Samiti at Kadamkuan, where JP lived.

The topic of the lecture was, â€œCall for total revolution more and more relevant for nationsâ€™ survivalâ€�.

Quoting various ancient Indian scriptures, Jois stressed the need to inculcate these teachings, which according to him, called for â€œselfless rulers, caste and communal amity, creation of need-based society and not a greed-based society and duty-based countryâ€�. He warned if the fate of the country is to be brightened then the society would have to go for a moral society based on oriental values of sacrifice and not based on the materialist philosophy of the West.

Chief minister Rabri Devi, in her speech at the JP roundabout, announced that JP thoughts would be included in school and college syllabus, steps will be taken to pay honorarium to women activists who were sent to jail during the 1974 movement and a JP chair would be set up in one of the state universities.

The CM, RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav and cabinet ministers visited JPâ€™s residence where they paid their obeisance to the late leader. Numerous other political parties and organisations too held meetings to pay homage to the Lok Nayak on the occasion which include BJP, JD(U), Bihar Sanskritik Vidyapeeth, Chhatra Yuva Sangharsh Vahini, Bihar Pradesh Lok Samiti, Lok Nayak Jaiprakash Vishwa Shanti Pratisthan, Manvadhikar Sanrakshan Pratisthan and HMT, Patna.

5,CM ko gussa aaya ’coz of ministers,"PATNA: CM Rabri Devi created a sensation in the concluding session of the RJD national council meeting here on Saturday when she threatened to quit her post due to the conduct of her ministers and party MLAs.

Her offer was, however, instantly rejected by the partymen in the meet. Later, RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav, giving the concluding speech, maintained that Rabriâ€™s remarks were an emotional outburst. â€œWhatever she may say, I have the power. I can assure you all that I will never divorce Rabri Devi,â€� he quipped. â€œIsme divorce ki baat kahan se aati hai? Sarkar, party aur pariwar alag-alag cheej hai (Where is the question of divorce? Government, party and family are different things),â€� Rabri retorted. Laloo, however, defended party ministers, MLAs and MPs for standing solidly behind him at the time of crisis.

Later speaking to TNN on phone, Rabri said her speech should be taken in proper perspective. â€œI have asked ministers and MLAs to counter the false NDA propaganda that nothing has been done by the state government. I have asked them to take party workers into confidence and build bridges between the two,â€� she said, adding her ministers are doing their job.

But Rabriâ€™s speech was not an ear-soothing one for her ministers. She said she was married in 1973 and came to Patna in 1974. â€œSince then I have been watching politics, and now I wish to quit. If you want to run the government and party, you will have to do it honestly,â€� she maintained.

Lamenting that her ministers were not doing their job, the CM complained that the charges of â€œpariwarwadâ€� are coming up from within the party. â€œDukh lagta hai,â€� she said, adding that a lot is being done for development but it is not being publicised by the ministers and MLAs.

â€œMany times when you call the ministers on phone, the answer is that they are in their constituencies. When you ring them up in their constituencies, you are told they are in remote villages,â€� she said, hinting at the inaccessibility of ministers.

She made a devastating comment on ministers making money. â€œKahan se aate hain, kahan chale jaate hain. Ek gari ke baad doosri gari, bus aur truck le lete hain [What conditions they come from and what they become (after being appointed as ministers). They purchase one car after another, then bus and truck],â€� she said.

6,"Jumbo Task? Fisheries, gardens ministeries","LUCKNOW: Mulayam Singh Yadav has beaten the track record of his predecessors. Though jumbo-sized ministries are not new to UP, this one takesthe cake. Former chief minister Mayawati headed an 86-member team. She tried silencing her critics with a blunt, â€˜â€˜I am still much below the highest markâ€™â€™.

She was alluding to Kalyan Singh who had inducted 95 ministers during his tenure in 1997. Both can now take a back seat. Mulayam was known to be a bitter critic of mega ministries. His detractors now run him down for not practising what he preached. However, his sympathisers say the size of his ministry is a political compulsion in the age of coalition politics.

The strategy, it seems, has worked. Nearly half his flock of 220 is moving around with red beacon lights â€” one happy brood, for sure. Brijendra Pratap Singh, a state minister who denounced Yadav as a dhokehbaaj for doling out an unfair deal to him and his colleagues from the Maya camp was dismissed on October 8. This has effectively arrested the whispering campaign.

Though the ministers all have offices, some may literally be twiddling their thumbs. What else can mantris like Shankh Lal Manjhi, the state minister for fisheries or Dharmendra Kumar Kashyap, the minister for gardens, do? Even otherwise, with departments like education, medical and heath, irrigation, engineering, etc, fragmented to accommodate the burgeoning numbers, most of the ministers may have to look around for constructive work.

Apart from cabinet ministers, the health sector has six junior ministers, the education sector has four state ministers, while the irrigation ministry has a separate minister for irrigation and mini- irrigation. The Estate Department has already allotted 50 bungalows and 49 flats to the ministers. UPâ€™s ministers are notorious for non-payment of house rent and electricity bills â€” the happy status quo may continue. Letâ€™s take a look at the expenditure incurred by a minister. Each minister is provided with one car and an escort vehicle.

This roughly amounts to Rs 1.25 crore per month for 98 ministers. Take phone bills and travelling allowance. With no official ceiling, the skyâ€™s the limit. In fact, ministers in the Rajnath Singh ministry had blown up Rs 10 crore just on travel and pocket money in one year, despite the recommendation of the Hukum Singh Committee which had fixed a ceiling of Rs 20,000 per month for these expenses. (See illustration for other expenses). Security expenses are mind-boggling.

Each of the 98 ministers has been provided with at least two gunners and has a guard of one head constable and four constables at his residence. This is apart from an escort duty comprising of one head constable and three constables. The salary of these security men alone would add up to at least a lakh. Mulayam Singh on his part is trying to cut down expenses.

He has already scaled down his security personnel from 150 to 75. Also, heâ€™s limited his fleet of cars from 12 to seven. Thatâ€™s against 10-15 his predecessors enjoyed. Heâ€™s also put an end to all free meals doled out by his official canteen. The numbers may go down further, said his secretary Shailesh Krishna. But how much success he gets in his attempts to lead by example, remains to be seen.

7,Mystery over finance analyst's suicide,"KOLKATA: A 25-year-old financial analyst with a giant steel manufacturing company was found hanging at her Southern Avenue residence on Friday night.

The death remains a puzzle as Manisha Mahapatra left no suicide note, OC Tollygunj K.K.Patra said.

Manisha used to stay alone in a two-bedroom flat at Southern Avenue.

The daughter of a Jamshedpurbased physician, Manisha was a bright suicide who had passed cost and chartered accountancy courses and had worked in Jamshedpur.

She moved to Kolkata about seven months back.

On Friday, Manisha returned home from work at 7:15 pm and locked herself in, according to the police. Later, when one of Manisha''s colleagues came visiting, there was no response to his knocks.

The security guards were alerted and the door was broken open three hours later.

Manisha was found hanging from her bedroom ceiling fan with her dupatta. Police could not find any obvious cause for the suicide.

Manisha was said to be soft-spoken and barely entertained anyone at home. Her younger sister was her only frequent visitor.

Neighbours said that Manisha worked very late, but rarely interacted with anyone.

8,IOC's Partial disinvestment yet to take place,"MUMBAI: The controversy over Union minister for disinvestment Arun Shourieâ€™s move for a partial disinvestment of Indian Oil Corporation has taken a new turn with Union petroleum minister Ram Naik insisting that his ministry had not received a formal proposal in this regard.

Mr Naik, who unlike Mr Shourie is opposed to the disinvestment of profit-making PSUs like IOC and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL), told newspersons here on Friday that his ministry had not received any proposal to use the partial holdings of IOC to acquire a stake in HPCL or Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL).

Mr Naik said he had only learnt from newspaper reports about a proposal for the partial disinvestment of IOC. â€œI have received no such proposal,â€™â€™ he reiterated.

He recalled that it was the Union governmentâ€™s decision to retain IOC, the Oil and Natural Gas Commission and the Gas Authority of India Limited in the public sector. That decision had not been changed, he emphasised.

Stating that Sunday was the last day to file a review-cum-clarificatory petition in the supreme court in connection with the courtâ€™s order striking down the disinvestment plan for HPCL and BPCL, Mr Naik said moving such a petition was one option considered by the Union cabinet.

The SC had ruled that since the two PSUs were set up by an act of parliament, the latter alone was qualified to decide on their disinvestment. The other option was to create a consensus to obtain support from other parties to get approval in parliament, as the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) had no majority in the Rajya Sabha.

While Union ministers Arun Jaitley, Arun Shourie and Sushma Swaraj were exploring the first option, Mr Naik and Mr Shourie were discussing the second, the petroleum minister said.

9,BJP woos lawyers at city seminar,"MUMBAI: Maharashtra Bharatiya Janata Party president Gopinath Munde appealed to the legislative and legal communities to highlight the plight of the less-fortunate sections of society at a day-long All Maharashtra Lawyersâ€™ Conference organised by the BJPâ€™s legal cell at Mulund in Mumbai on Saturday.

Mr Munde said the responsibility of lawyers had increased in India, especially in view of falling standards. He also urged lawyers to mobilise public opinion against the Democratic Front (DF) regime in Maharashtra.

â€œIf the BJP-Shiv Sena alliance takes over the governance of the state, a provision will be made to extend soft loans of up to Rs 2 lakhs to new law graduates to set up offices,â€™â€™ he announced to the delight of over 900 lawyers who had arrived from different parts of the state to attend the conference.

He asked lawyers to help influence public opinion in favour of a common civil code and said efforts should be made to conduct court work in local languages, so that litigants could find out what was happening.

Mr Munde said the principal job of a legislature was to make legislation. However, over the past couple of decades, this task had been relegated the lowest priority. Storming the well of the house and walkouts were occupying considerable amounts of time, leaving no time for making laws.

Mr Munde said lawyers were once regarded as the keepers of societyâ€™s conscience. They had been in the vanguard of the freedom struggle.

But there appeared to have been a deterioration in later years. Citing his own experience, Mr Munde pointed out that malpractice and unethical behaviour had started becoming the norm.

Addressing the conference in the evening, BJP president Venkaiah Naidu said his party along with members of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) would win the next Lok Sabha elections with a comfortable majority.

10,Bypolls as political barometer,"LUCKNOW: After change of guard in the state, bypolls for the two assembly seats â€” Harora in Saharanpur and Mahasi in Bahraich â€” could be crucial for both ruling coalition and the Bahujan Samaj Party.

For BSP, which held both the seats in the Vidhan Sabha till they fell vacant, the stakes are high. That former chief minister Mayawati held Harora seat for two consecutive terms, 1996 and 2002 with impressive margins, proves her hold on the electorates of this constituency.

Obviously, Mayawatiâ€™s preference for this seat, made it a hub of dalit politics in the western Uttar Pradesh. In the previous assembly polls, Mayawati won from two seats but preferred to retain it.

This proves Haroraâ€™s importance in Dalit politics. But, before that, the Bharatiya Janata Party and Janata Dal had won this seat with impressive margins in 1993 and 1991 respectively.

Another factor why Mayawati preferred to retain Harora was that western Uttar Pradesh was the nerve centre of Dalit politics in the 60â€™s when it was the Republican Party of Indiaâ€™s stronghold.

If the BSP wins this seat despite the dust generated by a number of controversies surrounding the former chief minister, it would demoralise the ruling coalition. On the other hand, a win by the ruling coalition would be a blow for Mayawati and BSP.

The other seat Mahasi is going for bypoll because of the death of BSP MLA Ali Bahadur. In the 2002 assembly poll, this seat went into the BSP kitty by a margin of nearly 8,000-odd votes. Prior to that, the BSP had never won this seat.

The defeat of BSP on these two seats would not only increase the numerical strength of the ruling coalition, but also boost up the image of ruling coalition. It would also convey the message that the minorities have moved away from the BSP. The two constituencies, it may be noted, have sizable Muslim population. Bypoll to these two seats is slated for November 20.

11,Suitable roadmap must for development: Vice-President,"JAYAPRAKASH NAGAR(Ballia): A suitable road-map of development, that could change the face of the nation, was needed for India so that it could lead the world in the 21st century, said vice president, Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, while addressing the concluding function of the birth centenary of Loknayak Jayaprakash Narayan on Saturday.

He promised that he would always be ready to extend all kind of support with his capacity in this work. Being a big state, UP should take initiative in this task, he said assuring the chief minister, Mulayam Singh Yadav, who was present at that function, about all possible help.

Facilitating the poor through a sustainable programme would be the true tributes to Jayaprakash Narayan, he said adding that India could not lead if the poor were neglected.

""Being a big state UP has a number of problems. I would like to suggest Mulayam Singh Yadav to go ahead with a suitable scheme for the poor to benefit the last man of the society"", he said and added that living with dignity was the fundamental right of every individual.

The problem of unemployment could be overcome by the quality education. It was pleasant to note that Indian professionals in IT were in great demand overseas. He said that India was now comparitively better off. It has sufficient foreign exchange and economically it is sound. What is needed most is the exploration of the areas where money could be invested, he added.

In his welcome speech, Mulayam Singh Yadav said that the state government would extend full support for the development of Jayaprakash Nagar and implementation of the programmes of the Jayaprakash Narayan Memorial Trust.

He said that people would have to take pledge to fulfill JPs dream of ''Sampurna Kranti (total revolution) by following the path shown by him. He also apreciated the union mninster for culture and tourism, Jagmohan for his stand on Taj corridor issue and said he (Jagmohan) not only saved the Taj but also protected the pride of India.

On the occasion, Jagmohan said that about 35 big development projects had been initiated in this area. Some of the works had been completed while others were near to complete. The development projects for this area were decided by a committee headed by the Vice President, he said and added that the former prime minister, Chandrashekhar was the inspiration of all these work.

Presiding over the function, noted journalist, Prabhash Joshi said that the central government had decided to develop heritage villages in the country as a symbol of Indian

culture, and Jayaprakash Nagar was one of them.

The function was also addressed by the union minister of state for foreign affairs, Digvijay Singh and senior socialist leader, Janeshwar Mishra.

12,Cong govt indulging in organised looting: Ananth Kumar,"NELAMANGALA, Bangalore: Launching `Janasangharsha Yatra'' to counter Congress `Janaspandana Yatra'', BJP state president Ananth Kumar alleged on Saturday that the Krishna government had indulged in ``organised looting''.

``Congress party is known for institutionalising corruption in this country. The Congress government in the state is continuing the tradition. It does not have any respect for citizens or public money,'' he said speaking to reporters here during the `programme.

Stating that the BJP was compelled to expose ``misdeeds'' of Congress through `Janasangharsha Yatra'', Kumar said the government turned a blind eye towards corruption in drought relief work, fake stamp paper racket and online lottery.

``The ministers and Congress party men are directly involved in these scams. They are receiving commission from online lottery operators,'' he alleged.

Claiming that people had contempt for Congress government, he said the BJP received tremendous response for its `Yatra''. ``Our campaign will not stop till we completely unmask organised looting by Congress,'' he stated.

On Sunday, the BJP would hold a public meeting in Tumkur as part of the programme.

13,Witnesses approve of minister's sons hand in scuffle,"LUDHIANA: Even as the dispute over the Minister for Prisons, Malkiat Singh Birmiâ€™s sons involvement in the scuffle at the Sarabhanagar remains a controversy, and the ministers autocratic role is once again being condemned widely, four different eye witnesses have come forth against all that the minister has put his stakes on.

Interestingly, all four are women. Two different pairs. One, which happened to be shopping at the market and another pair at the Sarabhanagar police station the same night, where they had gone to get their cars released.

These women have approached the TNN and say they are ready to give their statements in the magisterial inquiry as well.

Sonia Dhillon, a social worker was at Sarabhanagar market along with Sharanjit, owner of a showroom in Ghumar Mandi on the evening before the Dusshera, when the brawl had initiated. Sonia reminisces how five odd youth, including Vivek, son of the local Councilor, K L Chabbra had used abusive language for the SHO, Inspector, Sandeep Wadhera and his men at the market.

She explained that some of the boys had been misbehaving with the public at the market, and when the police had tried to stop them, Vivek had pulled over his car to try and help out his friends.

Sharanjit says he had shouted, ""Tenu pata nahin mein kaun han"" (You have no idea, who I am). He says another one added to the SHO, ""Tun bahut badee galtee kar reha hain"" (You are making a big mistake).

Another two women, Dimple Kapoor, who owns a restaurant near CMC hospital and Baljinder Kaur, a Housewife had visited the police station, Sarabhanagar to get their lost carâ€™s insurance claim papers signed they explain.

Dimple said, ""we were waiting for the SHO for the past fifteen minutes when suddenly a bunch of these angry youth rushed into the Munshiâ€™s office. The two women explain that it seemed they had already had a brawl with the police somewhere, and what occurred was in continuation of it. They were surprised at how the boys swore at the policemen in abusive language.

She added that one of them had said to the Munshi, Mohan Lal, tun tan suspended haan, tun zaada na bol. Tun kisdey naal gal kar reha hain tenu pata nahin (You are suspended, so quit talking. You have no idea, who you are dealing with here).

Baljinder says, another one had threatened, ""Thodeeyan naukarian gayian, tusi tan sade dara ten aakey nak ragdhoge"" (You have lost your jobs and you would have to come to our homes and apologize most humbly).

She says later the a man in white safari suit had come inside, who she learnt was Chabbra, the councilor. She says when the policemen had tried to apprise them of his son and friends outrageous behaviour, the councilor had replied, ""ameera de puttar enak kujh taan karan ge hee."" (Rich sons will indulge in this much atleast)

14,Pak media flays Musharraf's four-year rule,"ISLAMABAD: The Pakistani media has flayed President Pervez Musharraf for failing to hand over power to an elected administration and his ""inability"" to solve any major foreign or domestic problem during his four-year rule.

While there were visible gains like economic recovery mainly due to inflows of aid in the aftermath of the 9/11 turnaround in Pakistan''s pro-Taliban policy, the ""biggest failure"" has been the military''s inability to develop a national consensus on a workable political and constitutional framework, daily ''Dawn'' commented.

Referring to his election as President through a referendum in April, 2002 as a ""thoroughly spurious"" exercise, which failed to bestow legitimacy on Musharraf''s position as head of state, it said his four-year rule resulted more in a constitutional deadlock.

""At present, the army seems to have no exit strategy, and is hopelessly bogged down in day-to-day problems that range from reading electricity meters to keeping sewerage lines open,"" it said adding that Musharraf has failed to keep his promise to pave way for smooth transition of power.

""Over and above these political and constitutional matters, the nation has been shaken by a wave of terrorism that shows no signs of abating. This is a sad commentary on the working of a government that claims it is paying undivided attention to the war on terror,"" it added.

Listing a host of terrorist acts, including the bombing of the US consulate and the murder of 11 Frenchmen in Karachi, attack on a church in Bahawalpur, the killing of Shia worshippers in a mosque at Quetta and Karachi and killing of Sunni extremist leader Azam Teri, the daily said the military regime failed to contain terrorism and establish rule of law.

The daily said the military regime''s failure to contain terrorism and establish the rule of law is obvious.

""The government quite often seems unable to enforce its writ and restore public order and respect for the law. It would be futile to believe that acts of terrorism and sectarian violence can be crushed only through military and administrative means,"" it said adding that by nature army itself was incapable of solving these problems.

""The Musharraf regime has proved no to be no exception. It too has resorted to the same tactics"", it said.

Painting a gloomy picture of Musharraf''s rule, another newspaper, The Nation said ""But the four years have also been marked by major failures on the political front, largely if not solely because of the army''s obsession with its own way of looking at national affairs"".

""The biggest failure has been the military''s inability to develop a national consensus on a workable political and constitutional framework"".

The daily also listed Musharraf''s failure to ensure a smooth transition from the military rule to a civilian set up as another major failure.

""Among the major failures of General Musharraf is the lack of success in ensuring a smooth transition from the military rule to a civilian set up which has led to a constitutional crisis that seems to be nowhere near resolution.â€�It has therefore been at best a mixed performance and many think the balance is tilted to the negative side,"" the newspaper added.
