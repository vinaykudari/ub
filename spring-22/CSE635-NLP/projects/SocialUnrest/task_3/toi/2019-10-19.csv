0,BJP starts preliminary discussion on polls,"AHMEDABAD: The BJP, though busy with the ongoing Gujarat Gaurav Yatra, has started discussing the political situation in assembly constituencies of Ahmedabad and some districts of North Gujarat and Saurashtra, as the EC has hinted that elections in the state could be held in December.

Taking a break from the yatra, state BJP president Rajendrasinh Rana and other senior leaders of the party, including Bhupendrasinh Chudasma, Suresh Gandhi and Jayantibhai Barot got together at the circuit house annexe here and took stock of the political climate of each constituency of Ahmedabad city and other districts.

It is learnt that the leaders have taken into consideration a list of the Congress partyâ€™s possible nominees, finalised by GPCC president Shankarsinh Vaghela last week.

Rana told TNN: ""It was just a preliminary study of constituencies in Ahmedabad, Gandhinagar, Mehsana, Banaskantha, Patan, Rajkot, Surendranagar and Bharuch districts.""

1,BJP corporator alleges foul play in Pune development plan,"PUNE: In a serious allegation, BJP corporator Ujwal Keskar has accused the civic administration of deleting the reservation of 2,410 hectares as a hill-top hillslope zone, in contradiction of the draft development plan (DP) for the city''s 23 fringe villages.

He has threatened to move the high court if the Pune municipal corporation (PMC) throws open the said zone for residential development.

Speaking to reporters here on Thursday, Keskar, who is also vice-chairman of the city improvement committee (CIC), claimed a state minister had reportedly pressurised the city engineer''s office to delete these proposed reservations.

While refusing to comment on the allegation, city engineer V.G. Dhadphale said, ""We are yet to finalise the draft DP. The reservations we plan to earmark in the DP are strictly confidential. If Keskar has any objections, he should raise them after we table the draft DP for approval before the CIC meeting.""

Elaborating on the issue, Keskar pointed out that two years ago, the PMC had awarded a contract to India International Infrastructure Engineering (IIIT) Limited to prepare the draft of the DP for the 38 fringe villages (merged with PMC areas in 1997).

The company obtained satellite images of the land falling in these villages and also conducted a land-use survey.

Based on these reports, the company planners identified over 3,500 hectares of land in 38 villages which they felt should be strictly reserved as hill-top hill-slope zones.

However, after the draft was finalised in November 2000, the state government issued an order to de-link 15 of the villages fully, and five partially, from corporation limits.

The PMC was therefore required to redraft the DP for 23 villages. The PMC resolved that a fresh DP be prepared by city engineer V.G. Dhadphale as IIIT had already collected the required data.

Keskar said that as per the IIIT survey report, the hill-top hill-slope zone in these 23 villages measures 2,410 hectares.

However, now the administration has decided not to honour the IIT reports and stick to the regional plan (RP), according to which, only 500 hectares of land in these 23 villages can termed a hill-top hill-slope zone, he alleged.

2,Central agricultural team to visit Pune,"PUNE: A five-member central team will tour Pune on Friday to assess the loss in kharif crop yield following the dry spell in July, which had forced the state to declare drought-like situation.

The visit of the central team, headed by joint secretary in the agriculture ministry, Satish Chandra, will also review the relief work taken up by the state government under the employment guarantee scheme (EGS).

The visit of the central team to the drought-affected talukas in Pune division assumes significance as the state has declared the crop yield in this region as less than 50 per cent of average returns. The adversely-affected talukas in Pune include Purandar, Baramati, Indapur, Daund and Shirur.

Several talukas in Satara and Sangli districts have also been badly affected.

Speaking to TNN, divisional commissioner of Pune, Umeshchandra Sarangi, confirmed the visit of the central team to Purandar taluka in Pune district, and Khatav and Maan talukas in Satara. ""The team will go to three places in Purandar taluka, which received extremely poor rainfall in July and again in September too,"" he said.

Sarangi said all four affected talukas not only had a dry spell in July, but also a long absence of rains in September which, apparently, affected the crop yield. Sources in the commissionerate said these talukas in Pune had received just 35 per cent of the average expected rainfall.

Analysing the situation, a senior official in the commissioner''s office said the scarcity in July delayed the sowing of almost all kharif crops. Although the region did receive satisfactory rains in August, the nutrients required by the crops for good yield was inadequate, sources said. The bad spell in September practically stunted the growth of the crops during the maturity stage as there was not enough moisture in the soil.

Asked for his reaction to the situation, Sarangi only said it was a mixed scenario where certain talukas were adversely affected, while others got respite in August.

He refused to spell out the amount of central aid for Pune.

The central agricultural team is also scheduled to visit talukas in the Aurangabad district.

During their inspection, the central team members will also check the drinking water availability and fodder for animals, the sources said.

After their visit to talukas in Pune and Satara districts, the team will leave for Mumbai to meet C.M. Lal, principal secretary of the revenue and rehabilitation department, for further talks on the drought-like situation faced by farmers in the state due to a dry spell in July and September.

3,New US visa rules delays NRIs to return with spouses,"AHMEDABAD: NRI grooms flying down to marry Gujarati girls during this wedding season may be able to do ''chat mangni'' and ''pat byah'', but they may not be able to fly back with their spouses immediately.

A new rule introduced by the US visa authorities demands that the spouse of the newly wedded NRI should posses a passport sharing the same surname that the visa holder has.

Nilambari Sheth, head of the city''s US Visa Application Centre says, ""This new rule requires the spouse of the visa H1 or L1 holder to have a passport with changed name. If the applicant does not hold a passport with the changed surname, they cannot apply for the spouse dependent visa.""

She adds that the US Visa Facilitation Services (VFS) centre in the city gets a large number of applications for spouse dependent visas during the NRI wedding season from October to January.

From October 2001 to September 2002, the US Consulate Mumbai, the busiest centre in the South Asia issued 5,661 H4 non-immigrant spouse dependent visas.

With the new rule, applicants for H4 and L2 spouse-dependent visa will have to obtain a passport with their new surname. If a boy gets married to an NRI girl then, he will to have a new passport indicating her name as his spouse.

Ripam Patel, a mailman from Chicago who is in Ahmedabad for the past seven weeks looking for his right match, is all set to fly back with a ticket already booked for November 14 for his would-be spouse. With this new rule, many like Patel will have to either cancel their tickets or at least postpone till their spouse receives a new passport.

""During this season, many a such applicants will have to wait for their spouses'' new passport before applying for visas. The couples wanting to fly back together must apply for a new passport first,"" Sheth adds.

Many may think that with ''tatkal'' passport facilities available, new passport will be available within a week. However, Regional Passport Officer (RPO) is planning to do away with ''tatkal sewa'' for passport renewal category, in which police verification certificate is not required.

B B Swain, Regional Passport Officer (RPO), says ""We are working on decreasing the processing time to 20 days from this month for renewing passports that do not require police verification certificate. We have concentrated on this segment of applications which do not require police clearance certificate and are planning to reduce the processing time. And when renewed passport can be issued within 20 days, there is no need to offer ''tatkal'' facility for that category.""

Re-issuing passports before they are about to expire can be done, as noted in passport application information booklet, in case of change in residence, surname, name. Ahmedabad RPO last year received 3,000 such application and this year from January to August it has received 2,500 such applications.

However, with this rule, RPO will have to gear up to handle a rush of surname-change passport applications. So, till then it is a patient waiting period for newly weds.

4,BJP-ruled states intend to ban conversions,"PUNE: Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president Venkaiah Naidu on Thursday announced that his party would soon introduce an ordinance banning religious conversions in BJP-ruled states.

Speaking to reporters here he applauded the Tamil Naidu government for introducing the Prohibition of Forcible Conversions Ordinance on October 5.

Speaking to reporters here, Naidu said there was no point in introducing such an ordinance at the central level and making it mandatory for all states. ""Finally, the state government will have to execute this legislation. However, the BJP would appeal to all political parties to ask their state governments to introduce such ordinances.""

Naidu dismissed the demand made by the Congress to de-recognise Shiv Sena, following the Sena supremo Bal Thackeray''s controversial appeal to form suicide squads of Hindus.

""If we start de-recognising political parties on grounds of speeches made by their leaders, then the Congress would be the first to be de-recognised,"" he quipped.

Asked what action the BJP plans to initiate against Thackeray for his statement against the prime minister A.B. Vajpayee, Naidu said, ""I have already clarified that the BJP is not in agreement with views expressed by Thackeray.

These are his personal views. The people of India are happy with the steps initiated by Vajpayee against terrorism,"" he added.

The BJP chief, however, lashed out against the Congress and the Left for accusing the BJP of ""saffronising history"" through the new text-books being prepared by the National Council of Education Research and Training (NCERT). Citing the recent supreme court nod to the text-books, Naidu said the BJP would now embark on the campaign to expose the Congress and the Left for ""distorting history"" and disregarding the apex court''s judgement.

The NCERT issue would boomerang against the Congress if it continued to be guided by the Left, the BJP chief said, adding, ""the Communists have nothing to lose because they have already lost everywhere. In Kerala they are out and in Bengal they are in doubt.""

The BJP chief has called a meeting of all city and district unit chiefs from Maharashra in Pune on Friday to review the party''s gao chalo abhiyan (rural campaign). A similar national level meeting will be held in Delhi on October 19.

The party also plans to organise a rally, to be addressed by deputy prime minister L.K. Advani, at the Talkatora stadium in Delhi on October 25.

5,Dissidents tell BJP ministers to resign,"LUCKNOW: On the eve of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee''s visit, the 27 dissident MLAs and MLCs of the BJP upped the ante, demanding resignation of all party ministers from the Mayawati-led coalition government.

""We feel the BJP should support the government from outside just as the BSP was doing at the Centre,"" Ramashish Rai, an MLC, said at the end of a meeting attended, among others, by Ganga Bux Singh, Shiva Kant Ojha, Anil Verma, Ajit Singh and Bharat Tripathi.

The dissidents plan to meet the PM during his stay here on Saturday and Sunday to discuss the issue. For this, they have sought an appointment without routing their request through the state leadership.

The demand does not seem to augur well for the BJP, whose senior leader LK Advani had given a certificate of good governance to the Mayawati government and defended the coalition at the BSP''s ""Dhikkar rally"" held here on September 28.

Adding to BJP''s worry are the 12 Independents, the party''s allies, who are also unhappy over their non-inclusion in the ministry. At a dinner meeting hosted at the Taj hotel here, they too expressed their displeasure. ""We have our option open and we will disclose our strategy at the right time,"" said one of them.

The threat came despite urban development minister Lalji Tandon volunteering to attend their dinner without being formally invited.

But Tandon seemed to be a target of criticism within his party and factionalism seemed to gain ground in spite of his warning for disciplinary action against those found guilty of misconduct. This was evident from Ramashish Rai''s statement.

Tandon had already written a letter to state party president Vinay Katiyar to seek Rai''s explanation for his recent anti-party utterances.

Referring to the show cause notice issued by the party leadership, the dissidents said: ""It is the handiwork of those bent on forming the government in coalition with the BSP in spite of the BJP''s stand to sit in opposition after its dismal performance in the last assembly elections.""

While refusing to be dubbed dissidents, these legislators said they were in fact working to strengthen the party and their exercise was a part of the save BJP campaign. The party was bound to suffer when the experience, seniority and deserving candidates had been ignored in the cabinet expansion. It also failed to give due representation to different castes, regions and social combinations, they argued.

""Our concern is not the ministerial berth, but the erosion in the party''s base which has been aggravated due to the behaviour of irresponsible state leadership,"" they said and added that ""we will also seek the intervention of BJP president Venkaiah Naidu and LK Advani.""

6,Uptron union slams govt for ignoring demands,"LUCKNOW: At a meeting of factions of Uptron Bachao Sangh, held at the Uptron headquarters on Friday, the government was slammed for its callous atttitude towards finding a solution for the long-pending demands of the Uptron employees.

Employees expressed resentment over non-payment of VRS till date and said that the minister of state for information technology and electronics, had assured a delegation of the sangh that their VRS dues would be paid within 15 days. The promise however, turned out to be an empty one.

Sangh members also criticised the government for backtracking from its promise made to the sangh, that the Uptron employees who had not opted for VRS, would be absorbed in various government departments.

The sangh will hold its meeting in the state capital on Saturday, to decide on the future course of action.

7,Minister defends action plan on water policy,"NEW DELHI: A two-day dialogue was initiated by the Union water resources ministry here on Thursday with the Union Water Minister Arjun Charan Sethi putting up a strong defence of the draft action plan for the implementation of the new water policy.

The draft action plan was adopted by the National Water Resources Council earlier this year and has come in for criticism from all quarters, especially non-governmental organisations (NGOs), for encouraging private parties'' participation in the water sector.

At this crucial forum, however, the voluntary sector found little representation. It was dominated by retired officials of the Central Water Commission (CWC), Central Ground Water Board (CGWB), the water resources ministry and those who have worked in various capacities with the state governments.

Sethi maintained that the policy only provides an opportunity for the private sector''s participation in managing water resource facilities like dams and pumping houses and does not give them any rights over water sources.

Though no NGOs had been invited for the dialogue, their role in the water sector came up frequently. One participant noted that while there should be greater involvement of NGOs in executing the water policy, the plan had allocated most of the tasks to the ministry itself.

Prof B R Chauhan, an expert on water laws, said there should be people''s participation at the implementation and monitoring level as well.

To the action plan''s suggestion that planning of all water related activities be brought under one department for the states, one participant remarked: ""You must first set your own house in order. You don''t deal with urban, rural, industrial water supply but want states to do this.""

8,AP bishops condemn anti-conversion law,"HYDERABAD: The AP Council of Churches and AP Catholic Bishops Council Commission on Public Affairs held a joint session on Friday, to discuss the implications of the anti-conversion ordinance passed by the Tamil Nadu government.

The commission said churches are against forced conversions and the ''draconian law'' is unwarranted. Joint commission chairman Jerri A Oliver, in a press release, has urged the Tamil Nadu government to withdraw the ordinance.

The Andhra Pradesh Churches will observe October 20, as a day of prayer in solidarity with the Tamil Nadu minorities. Meanwhile, the All India Christian Council has denounced the Tamil Nadu religion conversion ordinance, terming it, violative of the Constitution.

The anti-conversion laws attack citizen''s human rights, ''demonise'' minorities and besmirch India''s global reputation, the council said.

In a press release issued here on Friday, the council said Tamil Nadu''s chief minister J Jayalalithaa''s measures in promulgating the ordinance have provoked global condemnation. ""It is a deliberate, cunning scheme to terrorise the minorities and to pamper the Sangh Parivar,"" it said.

""The church in India rejects conversions by force fraud and inducement. In fact the term ''forced and fraudulent conversions'' is used for political ends to divert public attention by right wing vested interests who are in fact forcing their own brand of ''one nation, one culture and one faith ideology on the people of India'', All India Christian Council president Joseph D''Souza and secretary general John Dayal said in the press release. Condemning the demand made by RSS chief K Sudharshan for a central act against the conversions, the council called for a satyagraha by the Dalits and minorities against ""the Hindutva conspiracy"".

9,Cost of farming highest in AP: Expert,"HYDERABAD: Directorate of Rice Research project director Dr B Mishra has advised state farmers to switch over to cost-effective farming and make extensive use of high-yielding varieties in view of the WTO agreement.

Participating in the farmers'' day programme organised by the DRR here on Friday, he said the farmers should be geared to meet international standards and competition.

Extensive use of pesticides was resulting in high ''pesticide residual'', which is not acceptable in the international market, he said.

""Cost of cultivation in Andhra Pradesh is Rs 20,000 per hectare, highest in the country. High use of pesticides is one of the reasons for the high cost,"" he said.

Speaking on consumption pattern, he said it would be a ""wrong policy"" to encourage cultivation of only fine quality of rice as 40 per cent people depend on common varieties.

10,Cong rebels say party ignored Telangana,"HYDERABAD: Failure of the Congress to address Telangana problems had resulted in demand for separate Pradesh Congress Committee, Congress Forum for Telangana (CFT) alleged.

Addressing a press conference here on Friday, CFT president Dr Mallikarjun said that the forum, in its first presidium committee meeting, had passed resolutions urging the All India Congress Committee (AICC) to pave the way for the formation of a separate PCC.

The party had failed to react to the issues raised by the MLAs and party activists of the region. He said that the demand was also necessitated by government''s injustice to the region.

He said that the Congress party''s attitude towards the Telangana had resulted in mushrooming of parties with the separate Telangana slogan.

The party failed to react on the demand for implementation of GO 610, sale of Nizam Sugars and its assets and indiscriminate disposal of valuable land in and around Hyderabad.

The CFT, in its resolutions, demanded the government to release Rs 5 lakh for every drought-hit mandal in the region.

It also demanded for waiver of power dues, students fees, loans taken by the farmers from cooperative and national banks and free supply of fodder.

Mallikarjun said that the resolution wanted completion of pending irrigation projects in the region.

The meeting condemned the amendment made to the presidential order on Six-Point Formula by the TDP without discussing in the Assembly or the Parliament. He demanded status quo on the issue.

Mallikarjun said that the Telangana MLAs would represent to AICC on the separate PCC after MLAs meeting on Saturday.

The meeting was attended by MLAs Sabita Indra Reddy, A Indrakaran Reddy and other senior Congress leaders from the region.

11,Violent protest against police firing in Muzaffarpur,"MUZAFFARPUR: An irate mob of about 1,000 villagers fought a pitched battle with the police on both sides of the Maniari police station near Kazi Inra Chowk, about 20 km from here, throughout the day on Friday, blocked the Muzaffarpur-Barauni national highway by felling and burning more than a dozen large sheesham trees on the road and paralysed the train services on the Muzaffarpur-Samastipur route by locking the Silauth railway station building in protest against the ""brutal killing"" of a local mukhiya, Sanjiv Kumar Sharma, and a villager, Mahesh Mahto, by the police at about 10 pm on Thursday.

The cause of the trouble was the ""ill-treatment"" of and ""assault"" on a tea-stall owner, Jaimangal Sah of Sitarampur village, and an alleged rape attempt on one of the female members of his family by an ASI of the Maniari police station, Brij Mohan Singh, who was accused by many of creating nuisance during his earlier posting at Sakra, Aurai and Sahebganj as well.

According to the villagers, when they went to the police station to protest against the ""assault"" on and arrest of Sah, the policemen fired five rounds in the air. Then, the mukhiya of the concerned Raghunathpur Madhuban panchayat, Sanjiv Kumar Sharma, was called from his house by his supporters to plead their case with the police.

As soon as the mukhiya entered the police station premises to speak to the officer in charge, he was shot at by the ASI from the guard room from a distance of only 10 feet with a rifle bullet hitting him in abdomen.

The police claimed that they opened fire to protect their arms. But the villagers refuted the police claim and branded the action as a clear-cut murder. The SP, R K Singh, suspended the ASI, officer in charge and guard room constable and took them with him to the police line for their safety.

Angered by the incident, the local people gheraoed the police station, and this time Mahesh Mahto was killed in police firing.

The police said they fired in all 21 rounds but the villagers claimed that only 10 rounds were fired by the police. The public dispersed after the second death in the firing.

A number of villagers complained that the ASI and some other policemen used to misbehave with village girls and women in drunken state every now and then, adding that the life of about 30 families of Sitarampur village had been turned into a hell by the staff of the police station.

The villagers are demanding the filing of an FIR under Section 302 of the IPC against the suspended ASI, immediate shifting of the Maniari police station and a compensation of Rs 5 lakh and a government job to each of the bereaved families. The DM and SP were negotiating with the angry villagers when the last reports came in.

12,CPI gears up for October 30 rally,"PATNA: The good fortunes of the Communist Party of India (CPI) depends on whether its ""Samajik Badlao Rally"" turns out to be a success or a failure. It would indicate whether the party can bounce back to regain its lost glory.

The rally is scheduled to be held here on October 30.

Perhaps this is the reason as to why the party state leadership has taken the rally seriously.

It could be gauged from the fact that the party state council meeting, held at the party state headquarters here at Ajay Bhavan on Thursday, was informed that the party local units conducted more than 1,000 public meetings, prior to Durga Puja across the state, to make the rally a success.

These meetings were addressed by senior party leaders like Rajya Sabha MP Gaya Singh, national secretariat member Atul Kumar Anjan, state party chief Jalaluddin Ansari and former state secretary Suraj Prasad.

The party has also decided to conduct state-level wall writing and poster campaign to make the party''s presence felt. The party leadership expects a massive turn out of the common people at its Samajik Badlao Rally.

13,Criminals rule the roost in Mokama,"PATNA: For the last one decade, Mokama area of Patna district has been witnessing a series of violent incidents. The latest kidnapping of three youths from the Moldiyar Tola locality of Mokama town on October 14 by dreaded gangster Nata Singh has once again exposed the complete grip of criminals in the Mokama area.

And in the existing situation, the police have only one role i.e. ""to witness the emergence of one gang after the elimination of another in this area and that too in gang wars"".

""What the police needs to do is establish its supremacy over the criminals of the area,"" remarked additional director general of police Ashish Ranjan Sinha on Thursday. Remarkably, Sinha''s statement came after his visit to Mokama on Wednesday evening.

He disclosed he held discussions with more than 500 local people on the premises of Mokama police station during his six-hour long stay there in the presence of central range DIG Ravindra Kumar while seeking a solution to end the problems.

The kidnapping of three youths is a case in point to understand the situation in Mokama. No police officer is in the position to attribute the incident to any other reason than the ongoing war of attrition between two gangsters â€” Naga Singh and Nata Singh.

""The kidnapped youths must have been perceived to be Naga''s men,"" Sinha guessed. One of the three kidnapped victims, Amaresh Singh, happens to be Naga''s cousin.

Earlier, the police appeared to have heaved a sigh of relief following the recovery of bodies of two notorious criminals â€” Mini Dilip Singh and Sanjay Singh alias Sanju â€” on September 23 last year from the same area.

Police sources said Naga deserted controversial Mokama MLA Surajbhan a few years back and formed his own gang. Sources further maintained Surajbhan had made several unsuccessful bid to bring peace in Mokama area soon after his victory in the assembly election.

To some extent, the area was crime-free. But things changed following an altercation between Surajbhan and Naga over the issue of a tender. Later, Naga reportedly joined hands with another notorious criminal, Pappu Dev of Saharsa, who is considered to be a rival of Surajbhan.

In the recent past, the Mokama police undertook efforts to destroy the strong network of criminals spread in this area. The police also seized a large number of sophisticated weapons from the criminals recently.

But the failure of the police in checking the emergence of criminals has so far badly affected the industrial establishments like Bata India Limited and Bharat Wagon.

Police sources also maintained that Mokama, unlike the past, is no more a regular source of income by way of crime for the criminals. Another factor behind the police failure is attributed to the topography of the area.

14,Fund-starved civic body has no development plan,"DARBHANGA: At a time when various state governments are being pilloried for adopting populist measures, the fund-starved civic body here seems to earn ""kudos"" from certain quarters for being soft on holding-tax defaulters as well as encroachers.

Tax collectors from the municipal body say more often than not people refuse tax payments on the ground ""no facilities, no tax"". Although periodic holding-tax collection camps organised by the authorities in various wards evoke response to a certain extent, the money collected does not constitute a substantial amount to facilitate development activities, civic body sources said.

According to informed sources, municipal authorities have been directed to prepare a list of defaulters, who owe an outstanding amount of Rs 10,000 or more as holding-tax. An amount of over Rs five crore is due as holding-tax on the residents as well as government and other offices situated in various wards, the sources further informed.

However, a resident of ward number 9, a teacher by profession, charged that discrepancies in assessment and fixation of holding-tax is also one of the factors behind dilly-dallying attitude of some of the residents in payment of taxes.

Sporadic anti-encroachment drives launched by the civic body have also failed to provide any concrete solution to the problem as a couple of days after each drive, illegal structures appear once again with a vengeance.

Meanwhile, Darbhanga mayor Omprakash Khedia â€˜Mithhu'' told this correspondent that he does not have any future plans for developmental activities in the face of fund crunch.

""Since assuming charge of the office last month we made hectic efforts to launch a cleanliness drive on priority basis along the main roads as well as Durga Puja venues besides providing street lights in prominent localities. As we did not have fund to carry out the works, the money was arranged through bank loan,"" the mayor informed.

""As of now, our main task is to maintain cleanliness on the occasion of sabe barat festival. Efforts will be made to clean various ghats for chhath festival, which is round the corner,"" the mayor said. As far as development schemes are concerned, we are keeping our fingers crossed, he further said.

15,"Vigilance dept arrests JSEB SDO, engineer","JAMSHEDPUR: The anti-corruption cell of the state vigilance department arrested an SDO and an assistant engineer of the Jharkhand State Electricity Board (JSEB) here on Friday.

The vigilance sleuths are reported to have recovered a little over Rs 6.65 lakhs from the residence of the SDO of JSEB''s Mango division, K K Sinha. It''s the largest recovery by the vigilance department since the creation of Jharkhand state.

Sinha along with assistant engineer Gauri Shankar Pundit was caught red-handed accepting Rs 25,000 as bribe from a local industrialist. Both the officers were picked up from Sinha''s old Purulia road residence in Mango this morning.

A team led by DSP Nagendra Choudhary had laid a trap to apprehend the JSEB officials, following a complaint that the duo had demanded a hefty sum to install a new transformer.

The industrialist reportedly had already paid about Rs 88,000 to the JSEB engineers. ""He had approached the vigilance department after a fresh demand of Rs 25,000 more was made,"" sources revealed.

The vigilance officials also searched Pundit''s house in Sidgora. However, nothing incriminating was found at this residence.

The two engineers have been taken to Ranchi and a case has been registered against them. Early this month, the assistant mining officer of East Singhbhum district was nabbed while accepting bribe. The assistant mining officer, Arun Kumar, had allegedly demanded money to clear a project.

The anti-corruption cell of the vigilance department so far has made arrested 101. At least 10 government officials have been nabbed on corruption charges in Singhbhum alone.

16,Canal eviction put off under party pressure,"KOLKATA: Bowing to pressure from the city unit of the Left Front, the West Bengal government on Friday deferred its decision to evict settlers along the banks of the Beliaghata canal. The eviction was to have begun from October 22.

""Since the festive season is on, we have decided to defer the eviction campaign,"" state irrigation minister Amalendralal Roy told newspersons at the state secretariat. The Left Front had called upon the government to defer the eviction as the Muslim holy month of Ramzan is to set in soon, ending in the first week of December.

Meanwhile, the Beliaghata Khalpar Basinda Committee, a forum of the encroachers along the canal, have written to the West Bengal Human Rights Commission to intervene in the matter. ""The practice of forced eviction is a gross violation of human rights,"" forum secretary Sona Das said.

The decision about the eviction from Ghazanavi bridge near Cossipore to Beliaghata, was taken late last year. Urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya had then said discussions would be held with citizensâ€™ fora and local political bodies before the evacuation process begins.

The process was to culminate with the eviction on Tuesday. The deadline for the projectâ€™s completion is May 2003.

Roy did not specify when work would restart. ""Around 17,000 people live in these canal banks. They belong to all faiths and we have to honour them,"" he said.

A sum of Rs 2,500 is to be paid to the evictees as shifting allowance. Bhattacharya admitted that the conditions of the Asian Development Bank, which sets rehabilitation of evictees as a mandatory condition for its loan, is causing problems. ""This has set a precedence for encroachers,"" he said.

Roy said that he was opposed to any rehabilitation package. ""These waterways belong to us. Why should we pay to remove those who are illegally occupying it?"" he said. He criticised a section of his own partymen who were sympathising with the encroachers.

The Rs 200-crore loan to the state government by the Housing and Urban Development Corporation to dredge some of the major city canals does not contain any component for rehabilitation. State government sources said the dredging cost has escalated to over Rs 250 crore due to delay in the eviction process.

Mayor Subrata Mukherjee was visibly upset when he heard of the governmentâ€™s decision. ""This is a complete betrayal of the people of Kolkata. Just for the sake of a few, they are playing with the lives of millions of residents of the city,"" he said.

""I have said repeatedly that the cleanup process should be â€˜Now or Neverâ€™. If the eviction proc-ess is not taken up immediately, no one should blame us if streets remain waterlogged or people die due to malaria,"" he added.

17,Bureaucrats clash over perks,"KOLKATA: The much-hyped austerity drive of the state government has led to a virtual stand-off between the IAS top brass and the middle-tier officers belonging to the West Bengal Civil Services.

The WBCS (Executive) Officers Association, while supporting the government circular on curbing wasteful expenditure, has shot off a letter to the chief minister on Thursday complaining that the drive was biased against them and the lower-level employees.

""We have reasons to believe that the circular was issued by those enjoying perks and privileges brazenly disregarding rules and drawing allowances not enjoyed by the state civil services officers despite performing the same job at a different level. It deliberately hurts the middle tier of the administration,"" the letter stated.

For instance, the new directives regarding cars, phones, etc. have allowed departmental secretaries and special secretaries, mostly IAS officers, to use separate cars.

But joint secretaries, mostly WBCS officers, have been asked to use the pool car, three per ve-hicle while subordinates including deputy secretaries have been denied the privilege. Restriction on phones has also hurt WBCS cadres the most, fumed the association.

""The new measures, instead of addressing serious issues, seeks to wipe out the administration''s middle tier that constitutes the pivot of our system,"" added the letter.

The association sought an ""adequate infrastructural back-up to strengthen the tier"" to ensure a smooth implementation of the development projects.

It demanded a committee of ministers to make periodical review of the drive fearing ""arm-twisting"" by their IAS superiors.

18,Non-Cong govts have stalled development: Sonia,"GORAKHPUR: All India Congress Committee (AICC) president Sonia Gandhi, blaming the successive non-Congress governments for backwardness prevailing in the state, said that only the Congress could lead the state on the path of development.

Addressing party workers of Gorakhpur and Basti divisions at SNM Tripathi auditorium of the DDU Gorakhpur University here on Friday, she said that the non-Congress governments had stalled all the developmental activities in the state.

Closure of industrial units and sugar mills had created unemployment problem and skilled and non-skilled workers were leading a miserable life, she said adding that anti-social elements were being protected by the ruling combine.

Sonia said that to strengthen the party network in UP she had decided to meet grass-root workers. She said that she had met party workers in Mathura recently and added that more such meetings would be organised in different parts of the state soon.

Exhorting party workers to solve problems being faced by farmers, Sonia said if they too ignored this section of the society then who else would come to their rescue. She admitted that groupism had weakened the Congress in the state and laid stress on discipline.

Urging workers to strengthen the party network in the state, the AICC chief said said that today the people were looking towards the Congress as it was the only party which could solve their problems.

Earlier, when Sonia entered the meeting venue Congress workers rented the air with slogans of Rajiv Gandhi Amar Rahein, Sonia Gandhi Zindabad, Congress party Zindabad. They gave her a standing ovation when she admitted that some undeserving candidates had acquired party posts in the state.

Earlier, state president of the Congress Arun Singh Munna and national treasure Motilal Vora accorded a warm welcome to Sonia. National general secretary of the party Subodhkant Sahai, Mohsina Kidwai, former UP chief minister Ram Naresh Yadav and AICC member and former governor of Haryana Mahabir Prasad were also present on the occasion.

19,"It's a battle of principles, says PDP","SRINAGAR: The PDP on Saturday showed no signs of backing off from its claim to the chief minister''s post in Jammu and Kashmir even as the Congress deputed Manmohan Singh to mediate between the two warring parties.

Stepping up the pressure on the Congress, PDP Vice-President Mehbooba Mufti said, ""Congress should understand that the alliance can get going once someone from the PDP is appointed as the chief minister.""

She said her party was in favour of settling the issues through dialogue but was unaware what the Congress would do next to solve the impasse.

Mehbooba said this was not a fight between PDP President Mufti Mohammed Sayeed and Congress chief Ghulam Nabi Azad, but a battle based on principles.

""Let me make it clear that Congress should understand that PDP has been given the mandate in the Valley against National Conference and should be allowed to serve the people,"" she said.

She alleged that the Congress was spreading rumours about its staking claim to form government which leaves the independents, whose support is crucial for government formation, vulnerable to horse trading.

The PDP vice-president said, ""Congress should come and hold talks and stop making claims and adopting a one-sided approach in resolving the crisis.""

The Congress, on its part, decided to send senior leader Manmohan Singh to Srinagar on Sunday to hold talks with PDP President Mufti Mohammed Sayeed on firming up a coalition government in the state.

A decision to this effect was taken by Congress President Sonia Gandhi in Delhi after consultations with senior party leaders including J&K PCC President Ghulam Nabi Azad, party General Secretary Ambika Soni told reporters here.

The decision of the Congress high command came a day after Sayeed hardened his stand on the issue of chief ministership asserting that the PDP would firm up an alliance with other political parties only at its own terms or might sit in the Opposition.

Soni said the party President decided to send Singh for continuing the process of consultations on the issue of formation of a coalition Government.

""Our main objective is to consolidate the mandate of the people. It should not be frittered away"", she said.

Besides holding talks with the PDP president, Singh would also be interacting with leaders of all other non-National Conference and non-BJP parties including independents, she said.

20,Ex-Akali minister Garcha arrested in corruption case,"CHANDIGARH: There seems to be no let up in the Vigilance Bureau''s campaign to trap former SAD ministers in corruption cases.

A team of VB sleuths, in an early morning swoop on Saturday, arrested former technical education minister Jagdish Singh Garcha in Ludhiana on the charge of causing financial loss of about Rs 11.51 crore to the Punjab Technical University, Jalandhar, by committing largescale irregularities in setting up computer and technical education centres in and outside Punjab.

PTU director (outreach) Amarjit Singh Grewal was also picked up by the VB for his alleged connivance with the former SAD minister in the case.

Garcha is the fourth former SAD minister to be arrested by the VB. Earlier, Sucha Singh Langah, Tota Singh and AS Kohar were taken into custody for allegedly indulging in corrupt practices during their tenure as ministers in the SAD-BJP government.

VB chief director AP Pandey said two other associates of Garcha, his son, Parminder Singh and former PTU vice-chancellor, HS Guram, also booked in the case, were at large.

While Garcha''s son was not at his residence when the VB team raided his house, Guram has reportedly gone underground.

Garcha''s son used to indirectly look after the sanctioning of PTU study centres and make collections from those who had been allotted PTU franchisees.

The VB team recovered fixed deposits worth Rs 90.50 lakh, cash worth Rs 3.51 lakh and a computer from the former minister''s office, Garcha Enterprises, besides other documents related to his property, credit cards, and three cellular telephones.

Pandey said the VB investigations have also proved that illegal appointments were made in the PTU while question papers were leaked and answer-sheets tampered with.

Repression, says Badal: Within hours of Jagdish Singh Garcha''s arrest by the vigilance bureau (VB) Shiromani Akali Dal president Parkash Singh Badal strongly condemned the continuing reign of repression and lawless vendetta unleashed by chief minister Amarinder Singh against the SAD leaders.

Badal said that even the whereabouts of Garcha were being kept secret from his family and the party and we have no clue as to what the VB was really upto.

21,Nalco will incur losses if not privatised: Shourie,"NEW DELHI: Amid the ongoing controversies over sale of government equity in PSUs, Disinvestment Minister Arun Shourie on Saturday warned that NALCO would start incurring losses if its privatisation was delayed due to present conditions.

""Nalco will be in the same position as the Steel Authority of India (SAIL) in five years if the same conditions persist"", Shourie told reporters after inaugurating a hostel for North East students here.

Reacting to Coal and Mines Minister Uma Bharti''s reported statement that anyone who trivialises her struggle over Nalco disinvestment would bite the dust, he said Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had on Friday clarified the government''s position on the issue to Orissa Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik and wondered whether it meant ""the Prime Minister would bite dust"".

23,Allies threat will not affect NDA govt: Naidu,"MUMBAI: In a veiled attack on Shiv Sena, BJP president Venkaiah Naidu on Saturday night asserted that the NDA government''s stability would not be affected by threats from allies to pull out from the ruling coalition.

""If any ally walks out of the ruling coalition two more will join it,"" Naidu said at a function organised by party''s commerce cell.

Naidu''s statement assumes significance in the wake of Thackeray''s statement that if the NDA failed to heed to his suggestion on disinvestment, labour reforms and tackling terrorism he would ""come into his full colours"".

However, Naidu did not mention Sena or Thackeray in his speech.

Naidu lauded Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee as the tallest leader in the country saying, no one could come close to Vajpayee in credibility and acknowledgement for leadership qualities.

NDA was firmly in the saddle and there was no threat to its stability of the government, Naidu emphasised.

25,Udupi math seer challenged to contest polls,"BANGALORE: Incensed by Udupi Adamar math seer Vibudesha Theertha''s statement that he would quit India if Congress president Sonia Gandhi becomes the Prime Minister, two party functionaries have challenged him to abdicate his present responsibilities and contest against any of their candidates from Udupi.

""Being an Indian citizen, the pontiff is free to express his opinion. He is also free to contest against Sonia and try to stop her from becoming the PM,"" KPCC general secretary Prakash K. Rathod and secretary A. Kenche Gowda said on Saturday.

Both also suggested that the seer was free to quit the country, if he is so keen. ""There is no compelling need for him to wait till Sonia becomes the PM. Running several educational institutions, the seer should know that Sonia is a citizen of India from many years, elected to Lok Sabha and is its leader of opposition, a post which is equivalent to the rank of Union minister,"" they said.

The seer on Friday had announced that he would quit India if Sonia becomes the PM as he did not wished to be ruled by a person with ""foreign origin.""

27,Venkaiah defends disinvestment policy,"MUMBAI: Strongly defending Vajpayee government''s disinvestment policy, BJP president Venkaiah Naidu on Saturday night favoured government''s withdrawal from public sector entities and focus on providing infrastructure to the people.

""It is not the government''s business to do business and it should gradually withdraw from it to concentrate on infrastructure development,"" Naidu, who is here in connection with the party central office-bearers meeting, told a gathering of professionals at a function organised by BJP''s commerce cell.

""Why should the government run the loss making public sector units when it does not have funds for infrastructure projects?"" he questioned.

Naidu blamed the negativism of the body politic and emphasised the need for a broad consensus among political parties on issues like population control, environment, work culture, proper conduct of Parliament and state legislatures.

Listing the achievements of the NDA government, he said that progress made in telecom, IT, LPG sectors and infrastructure development was remarkable.

Naidu said that the need of the hour was to progress speedily setting aside contentious issues.

The BJP president, who is under attack for ""soft-pedalling"" on the issue of terrorism, said that the government had effectively combated the menace.

""ISI modules are being busted and government is countering the proxy-war waged by the neighbouring nation,"" he added.

""India can attack Pakistan and was not dependent on any other country to tackle the menace of terrorism,"" Naidu said, adding the government was consciously responding to the scourge. ""How can the menace of terrorism, plaguing the nation for last 20 years be stamped out in mere three years?"" he asked.

BJP spokesman Arun Jaitley said that the security forces had achieved superemacy over terrorists. He lashed out at the Nehruvian model of development and strongly favoured economic reforms.

28,CPM warns of agitation against anti-farmers policies,"BATHINDA: Raising cudgels against the Union and state governments for their antifarmers policies, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) has warned that economic riots may break out in the state in coming days.

The manner in which marginal farmers in Punjab are being pushed into a corner by the government by stripping them off all subsidies, the day is not far when they would be forced to come on roads starting a violent agitation, Balwant Singh, state secretary of CPM said here on Saturday.

While taking to media persons he said said his party would start a statewide agitation on October 22 from the parade ground in Chandigarh to protest the anti-farmer policies of the Union and state governments.

Increasing input costs, decreasing per hectare yield and stagnant or rather falling price of farm produce would force farmers in the state to embark on an agitational path.

Objecting strongly to the scrapping of free power to the farm sector in Punjab, Balwant Singh alleged that while the agriculture sector was being provided 28.85 per cent of total supplied power in the state, big business houses were indulging in theft of 38 per cent of total power supply in the state but state government has turned a blind eye to it.

Under the dictates of WTO and other international agencies, the government is withdrawing more and more subsidies from the farm sector but no action is being taken against big businessmen who had not returned nationalised banks money to the tune of Rs 11 lakh crore that they had taken as loans.

29,Man held for stealing from govt warehouse,"NEW DELHI: Delhi Police has arrested a transporter accused of siphoning 11,000 bags of sugar worth Rs 1.5 crore from a government warehouse in Karampura.

A special cell team under assistant commissioner of police L N Rao apprehended Ashok Kumar Goel near Jaipur Golden hospital on Friday evening.

Goel has been handed over to the crime branch. The police are still on a look-out for co-accused and manager of the warehouse S S Rana.

On questioning Goel, the police learnt he used to transport sugar from Uttar Pradesh to the warehouse in Delhi. He had the exclusive contract since 1995.

""This is the first case which has come to light. The scam could be worth more than Rs 1.5 crore,"" a police officer said.

According to the complaint filed by manager (vigilance) B S Mann of Delhi Consumer Co-operative Wholesale Stores Limited, a check was conducted at the warehouse on July 10.

During checking, 11,000 bags of sugar were found missing. When the team inquired about it, Rana claimed ignorance.

A case was then filed against Rana and Goel with the anti-corruption branch. The two, however, went missing since then.

""Goel admitted that he had a godown at Apsara near the Uttar Pradesh and Delhi border. Instead of taking sugar to the warehouse, Goel took it to his godown and then sold it in black,"" the officer said.

30,BJP to rally against power tariffs on Oct 22,"CHANDIGARH: While the SAD political affairs committee continued holding its marathon meeting till late on Saturday nighton deciding how best to counter the offensive launched by the Amarinder Singh government against party leaders, the state BJP announced to organise state-wide demonstrations on October 22 to protest against the governmentâ€™s decision to reimpose power tariff on farmers.

State BJP president B L Rinwa and general secretary Avinash Jaiswal in a joint statement condemned the Congress government for going back on its election promise not to burden farmers with power tariff.

""It was a complete betrayal with the farming community,"" they said.

When farmers are reeling under severe drought conditions and acute financial burden, it was criminal to impose more burden on them and compound their problems, they said.

The decision would hit all sections of society and cause resentment against the government, something that threatened to create law and order problems as well.

This has also proved that the Amarinder government had little sympathy for farmers. Be it the cause of providing drought relief or MSP, the state government had exhibited laid back attitude to deal with farmersâ€™ problems, they added.

Meanwhile, the SAD political affairs committee meeting which started at 4 pm at former chief minister Parkash Singh Badalâ€™s residence remained inconclusive till late night about the action plan it proposed to launch.

According to a party spokesman, the final decision would be taken on Sunday after another round of deliberations. The party leaders also expressed concern at the manner in which SGPC members were being hounded by the government.

Badal has called a meeting of all party MPs, MLAs, former MPs, former MLAs and district SAD chiefs in Ludhiana on October 21 to hold more discussion with the party leaders on countering Amarinderâ€™s offensive.

31,Punters see big business if Badal is arrested,"BATHINDA: More than political observers and mediapersons, it is punters who are more interested in the warof-attrition between Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh and former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal.

The tussle between Sarb Hind Shiromani Akali Dal president Gurcharan Singh Tohra and Badal also has possibilities, say punters.

Punters have now started inviting stakes on the probability of Badalâ€™s arrest and who gets a hold on the executive body of the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbhandak Committee (SGPC).

Will Badal be arrested? Will Tohra elbow Badal out of the SGPC? - are the questions which are netting in money for punters. The key to being a successful punter lies in finding out what people are willing to bet their money on.

""Business should always be booming,"" a punter told Times News Network.

""Whatever hits the front page of newspapers is what punters can exploit to their advantage,"" he added.

As of now their bread and butter depends on whether or not Badal would be arrested. The SGPC polls are also generating a lot of interest among those who are willing to put their money at stake.

Persons who have betted heavily are literally hanging on each word of SAD, SHSAD and Congress leaders. Bookies with Akali leanings are betting on whether Badal will be arrested or not.

About the excitement generated by the possibility of Badalâ€™s arrest, one punter said, ""Congresâ€™s bark has no bite. But those who are hopeful that Badal will be arrested are happy that former SSP Gurcharan Singh Pherurai, has also been arrested. And this may result in Badal arrest.

32,Fresh probe into Maisar Khana incident,"BATHINDA: The Punjab State Human Rights Commission has ordered a fresh probe into the incident of alleged torture of Bhartiya Kisan Union members by Bathinda police on July 24, last year, at Maisar Khana village here.

The DIG, in his inquiry, had exonerated police of all charges following which the BKU leaders had moved the PSHRC on October 1 on the plea that the DIG report was false, misleading and contrary to facts.

They requested the commission to order another inquiry into the incident through its own agency.

Now the PSHRC has directed SK Verma, ADGP of the commission, to conduct a probe and submit a report within two months.

The commission had earlier directed DIG of crime branch at Chandigarh to probe the incident after BKU leaders lodged a complaint with the PSHRC.

The BKU leaders had charged the police with mercilessly beating up nearly dozen male and female BKU members who had been sitting on a peaceful dharna on the Bathinda-Mansa road on July 24, 2001.

The BKU members had demanded the arrest of a commission agent on the charge of abetment to suicide of Mithu Singh, a farmer of Sandoha village.

33,Mumbai's spirit rules hearts of expats,"MUMBAI: Mumbai and Delhi are the among the worst cities in the world for expatriates to live in, says a study by the London-based Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), the business information arm of the Economist group.

The EIU survey, which covered 130 cities, ranked Delhi and Mumbai 121 and 124 and attributed to them an ""extreme"" hardship rating of 62 and 57 per cent respectively. But do our expats really find Mumbai a hardship posting?

Says Englishwoman Aloise Price, wife of Dominic Price, managing director of JP Morgan, and mother of three: ""I''m astonished. I wonder if anyone actually visited the 130 cities in order to make the comparison. To those having a positive attitude and some imagination, an expatriate life in Mumbai is colourful, exciting, invigorating and a better alternative to many others,"" says Price.

""Recreational options may not be as neat and prepackaged as they are in many cities that scored higher, but with a little imagination there are a multitude of things to do here. Moreover, the friendliness and welcoming attitude of the Mumbaiites must rank right up at the top versus most cities,"" she adds.

Australian consular officer Renee Jarvis, who came in early this year from Melbourne (a steep fall from the No 1 city to No 124), thinks so too.

""I feel at home here because Indians are friendly,"" Jarvis said. ""Of course, Mumbai is not as easy as Melbourne. Housing''s a lot more expensive. One spends a lot more time commuting here, the traffic congestion''s awful. There''s less access to parks and beaches, less time for friends and outdoor activities. But the place is so vibrant that one can live with the pinpricks.""

Agrees Swiss consul Joseph Koch, a son-in-law of the soil.

""The climate''s bad, the pollution''s worse, housing''s costly, cello teachers aren''t easy to come by. And the German School couldn''t take my 13-year-old twins in because they would have been the only ones in the sixth grade. So the kids had to join the American School and switch to studying in English, which isn''t easy even if their mother is an Indian,"" laments Koch.

""But one factor makes up for all these irritants â€” the spirit of Mumbai. This city is very alive, very energising... quite unlike Karachi, where we went to party after party but had absolutely no cultural life.""

And what about this ""hardship allowance"" â€” as the EIU recommended â€” for places like Mumbai, Delhi and Karachi? Ridiculous, felt many expats.

""I find little hardship here,"" declared British businessman and Yacht Club regular Graham Tullet, an ex-soldier who spends half his time in Mumbai. ""In fact, some services are far better in India than they are in England, like health, for instance. The National Health Service in England has gone down the tube. So when I need treatment of any sort, I get it done in India.""

""That''s right,"" chipped in Aloise Price. ""Some of my fellowmen have abandoned their National Health Service waiting lists in the UK, to have their ills attended to quickly, efficiently and at negligible cost here.""

34,Over 193 engg seats remain vacant in govt colleges,"AHMEDABAD: Students of Gujarat have stuck a rude thumbs-down to the ever-increasing number of payment seats granted to self-financed colleges by the state government.

An unprecedented, 193 engineering payment degree seats still lie vacant as the centralised admission process draws to a close on Saturday. Whatâ€™s more, an estimated 1,200 diploma engineering seats are also going to be vacant this year!

In the past three years, an estimated 4,000 degree as well as diploma seats were increased at engineering colleges across the state. But the state government seems to have got its demand and supply equation all wrong this time. Never in the past have students given a go by to such a large number of engineering seats.

â€œThis is for the first time that such a large number of engineering degree seats have remained vacant. In the past, the highest number of seats to go unfilled was not more than 50,â€� said Prof H N Prajapati, who heads the centralised admission committee for engineering and pharmacy degree and diploma courses.

Of the engineering courses that have been cold-shouldered by the students, the hardest-hit is the Information Technology (IT) stream, where 112 seats are still unoccupied. The significant hike in the number of IT seats during the IT boom is apparently finding no takers ever since the IT bubble burst.

Interestingly, IT is followed by more conventional streams like chemical engineering, where 47 seats are vacant. Other engineering faculties cold-shouldered by the students include food processing with 18 vacant seats, instrumentation and control with three vacant seats, textile technology with six and textile processing with seven vacant seats respectively.

Experts in the engineering fraternity point that a multitude of factors are responsible for this sudden loss of interest in students. First and foremost is the excruciating delay in the centralised admission process that forces many students, especially those with average marks between 60-65 per cent, to seek admission in self-financed colleges outside the state.

â€œA student with 60 per cent marks is insecure about his admission in the state and would obviously not wait till December to find out whether he gets a seat in Gujarat or not. He will obviously go looking for seats in colleges outside the state,â€� said a senior official in the engineering faculty.

Overall recession, experts say, is also contributing to students remaining away from spending huge amounts for taking admission in faculties where there is no assured scope of employment afterwards. â€œOverall scene of unemployment in the engineering industry is also prompting students to refrain from spending lakhs of rupees and taking admission,â€� said another expert.

This is especially applicable to the IT sector where recession has made a big dent. â€œThe state government in its enthusiasm went overboard in increasing IT seats but has done precious little to nurture the IT industry in the state. With such a dismal scenario prevailing in the state, which student will want to invest lakhs of rupees and take admission on a payment seat?â€� quizzed another expert.

35,Govt rules out talks with Pak for now,"NEW DELHI: Despite pressure from the US to start a peace process with Pakistan, the Vajpayee government has rejected the possibility of a dialogue with Islamabad.

The government is prepared to make some goodwill gestures like removing troops from the Western border and more later, but insists there is no possiblility of talks till Pakistan reciprocates with concrete measures denouncing militancy in Kashmir, sources in the home ministry said.

Even while pulling back troops from the border, the government is keeping the forces in a state of preparedness to counter any eventuality.

A meeting to discuss the details of the state of defence preparedness has been called at the South Block (ministry of defence) on October 23. Apart from the commanders of the Army, the Navy and the Air Force and the defence minister, the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and the foreign minister will attend the meet.

According to defence ministry sources, the troops will be pulled back from the international border (IB) and not the line of control (LoC). Also, the 3.5 lakh forces stationed along the IB is being pulled back in a phased manner.

The entire process may take about one-and-a-half months.
