0,Advocates protest amendment to the Legal Services Act,"AHMEDABAD: Joining the nation-wide protest against the amendment to the Legal Services Authorities Act and the Centre''s volte face on the issue, members of the Bar Council of Gujarat (BCG) staged a day''s token dharna at the Income-Tax circle here on Friday. They claimed that minister for legal affairs and justice Jana Krishnamurthy had promised the Council in writing that its representation about the amendment will be considered. However, the government acted contrary to the promise. ""The 2002 amendments to the Act, will mean more trouble for the litigants and common people. We believe that it will pose problems in the jurisdiction of the civil courts and cause problems in the process of justice,"" said Council chairman Bahadursinh Jadeja. A large number of members of the Council and its office-bearers joined the day-long token fast. ""Because of the amendment, the senior- most judge becomes the chairman of the Lok Adalat and can appoint any two persons of his choice, irrespective of the background of the person,"" said advocate Afzalkhan Pathan. ""These members could be someone without a legal background or could even be illiterate. Whatever judgement they deliver, will be final and cannot be challenged in the civil court,"" he said. Protesting the amendment as ""unjust"", secretary R R Shukla said ""Usually, both parties agree on going to the Lok Adalat and, therefore, the decision would be binding on both the parties. But now even if one of the litigants prefers not to go to Lok Adalat, he will be forced to do so. This is injustice, as going to an alternative legal mechanism cannot be forced on someone."" What has really irked the advocates is the provision that bars the advocates from taking part in the legal proceedings at the Lok Adalat. ""The litigants will have to represent themselves as there will be no lawyers to help them. In other words, they will be forced to accept the decision taken by the panel,"" Shukla feared. The Bar Council members expressed fear about the fate of the millions engaged in the legal profession. ""We are going back to the ancient panchayat system,"" said advocate Anil Kella. ""We are also worried about the kind of people making it to the Lok Adalat, since there are no restrictions on their selection,"" said the advocates. The legal eagles also challenged the government''s stance in limiting the scope of the Lok Adalat. ""Why are the Lok Adalats limited only to motor accident claims and maintenance cases? Why are the criminal cases not decided there? Why is the government not transferring its cases to the Lok Adalats?"" they demanded. Meanwhile, in Baroda, lawyers will boycott all programmes organised by the district and state legal services authorities on Saturday, on the occasion of the National Legal Literacy Day, in response to the nation-wide protest call given by the Bar Council of India (BCI) and Bar Council of Gujarat (BCG). In a decision taken by the Baroda Bar Association, the city lawyers will also boycott the Lok Adalat and legal literacy camp for handicapped persons to be held by the district legal services authority.

6,Antony lashes out at Infam leaders for breaching law,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Chief Minister A K Antony on Sunday lashed out at the independent farmers movement Infam, for staging a dharna before Agriculture minister K R Gowry Amma''s office recently.

""What the Infam delegation led by a priest has done was a serious offence. As educated people, they should never have committed a law-and-order breach,"" Antony told reporters when his attention was drawn to the illegal occupation of government land by advasis in Kannur and Kasargod districts.

""Why you blame the poor adivasis alone. What about the law and order violation by Infam?"" he counterposed when asked about the situation arising out of the tribal stir.

""In my view, law and order violation by the educated and the elite is a bigger offence. There is a feeling here that the elite and VIPs are above the law. We have to change ourselves into a society that respects the rule of law, irrespective of one''s status"", he said.

Six Infam activists led by its chairman Fr. Mathew Vadakkemuri were arrested and remanded last week for holding a dharna at the Agriculture minister''s office here demanding that the government clear the subsidy amount due to Infam by way of exporting rubber.

Referring to the landrights agitation by tribals, Antony said the UDF government was committed to distributing one acre of land for each landless tribal family. So far,1740 acre of land had already been distributed. A review meeting would be held this month to speed up the process, he said.
