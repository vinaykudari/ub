0,Farmers accuse govt of slyly releasing water to from Kabini,"MYSORE: Raitha Sangha leaders from Heggadadevankote taluk on Saturday accused the government of making plan to release water slyly to Tamil Nadu through Kabini river by creating ""secret gates"" to dam's right bank canal. At a press meet here, the leaders who released a picture of the gates constructed to Kabini right bank canal between Shantipura and Kunnapattan 12 kms below the dam's downstream said this is the "" new game plan"" of the government to maintain water release to Tamil Nadu from Kabini river. Raith leaders Vivek Cariappa and H.K.Mahendra said the government has created and constructed these two side gates to the right bank canal with an intention to hoodwink the farmers who are repeatedly protesting the water release to Tamil Nadu. They said the gates which are constructed at a cost of Rs 50 lakh without even calling for the tenders by the department officials themselves have a direct link to the river stream. "" Kabin river flows hardly a 150 mts north of these two canal's gates which are parallel to both the river and canal"" they disclosed adding that government can release water to the river through these gates besides simultaneously maintaining water supply to the fields through canal. ""Now government can any time increase the water flow to Tamil Nadu without opening the dam's crest gates by increasing the water quantum into the right bank canal"" they said.This alternative method created by the state government to release water to Tamil Nadu is also intended to avoid the vigilant eyes of the farmers who buoyed by the martyrdom of Guruswamy often threaten to jump into the river water, they alleged. Cariappa claimed that according to information gathered from various sources the gates have been constructed with a sole intention to maintain water release to Tamil Nadu by avoiding the water release into the river from right below the dam where the farmers stage protests and organise dharnas. ""Though we have tried to contact and elicit information from the officials of the water resource department on the purpose of the gates constructed midway of the canal , the engineers are silent and refuse to speak on the issue"" he disclosed and asked :if the gates have been created for the benefit of the state farmers what prevented the officials from revealing the truth. ""Even spot where the gates located are also a reason of worry for the farmers as it is a silent zone where not even the cattle grazers will venture"" they added. Raith leaders said soon they will summon a meeting of other farmers leaders from Kollegal, Yelandur and Nanjangud taluks to discuss the issue and chalk out further action plan against the state government. ""We will not allow the authorities to open these gates and an agitation will be launched to close these gates which are ment to facilitate water release to Tamil Nadu"" they said. Raith leaders Somashekar, Krishna, Srinivas, Prasanna and R.Shivappa were also present in the press meet.

3,Residents want land acquisition collector arrested,"PANCHKULA: In an unprecedented move, two women residents of Sector 2 here have sought the civil arrest of the land acquisition collector (LAC), Panchkula, and the chief administrator of the Haryana Urban Development Authority (Huda), for having failed to release the balance payment of the amount of compensation awarded by court.

The additional district and sessions court on Saturday directed both the officials to appear in person in court. It issued them a show-cause notice, asking why the proceedings of civil arrest should not be initiated against them. The next hearing of the case is fixed for October 11.

The order came from the court of additional district and sessions judge L N Jindal (ADJ) on the applications moved by Sector 2 resident Shakuntala Devi and Tara Devi pertaining to recovery of around Rs 33 lakh from the LAC, Panchkula.

The move was a fallout of the attachment orders of the accounts of Huda and LAC in Chandigarh bank having returned unserved by the bank on account of jurisdiction problems, the counsel appearing on the behalf of the women said.

Enquiries revealed that the women were among those land-owners of Jhuriwala and Bana Madanpur villages whose land was acquired by the LAC for floating Sector 23 of the Panchkula Urban Estate.

The LAC had acquired their land in 1995 and after that compensation was announced in 1997. The women went in litigation in the court of the additional district and sessions judge in 2001,. The case was disposed of in September 2002 in their favour.

Sources said that 50 per cent of the decreed amount of Rs 33 lakh each was disbursed by the LAC while Shakuntala Devi as well as Tara Devi were running from pillar to post for the recovery of rest of the amount.

The move,which is first of its kind in the the recovery of a decreed amount, has once again exposed the laxity of Huda as well as LAC officials in facing such situations. There have been incidents when the court had ordered the auction of vehicles, office furniture and other immovable properties belonging to the Huda chief administrator, the Panchkula deputy commissioner, the LAC and other senior bureaucrats involved in the acquisition process.

4,"In 15 yrs, law and fate took their own course","CHANDIGARH:From a college principal to a convict, 68-year-old Khushi Ram can only wish to rewind the time and make amends. For a forgery committed 15 years ago, the chief judicial magistrate sentenced him to two years imprisonment and Rs 4,000 fine on Saturday.

Khushi Ram had forged answerbooks to help his son and a friend get engineering degrees from Punjab Engineering College (PEC). Ironically, Khushi Ramâ€™s son and his friend, both died during the trial.

In 1984, Kushi Ramâ€™s son Ram Kumar had taken admission at PEC. His friend Kailash, who had failed in BE examinations of the college, devised a plan to smuggle written answerbooks with Kumarâ€™s help.

Kailash had managed to get a specimen of answerbook for the BE examination held in 1987. He along with Ram took these answersheets to Hapur where Ramâ€™s father Khushi Ram was posted as principal in Government Inter College. Aiding the forgery, Khushi Ram got the copy of answersheets printed at a press there and even gave Rs 150 advance for 200 copies.

By the time, Kumar and Kailash had taken sketches of stamps of controller of Panjab University and prepared two blocks of stamps.

They had purchased a machine to mark serial numbers on answerbooks and a date stamp too. As per the plan, Kailash had applied for a reappear and the entire material was kept at the hostel.

During the examinations, Kailash would write down questions and serial number of answersheet on a paper, pack it in a cigratte box and throw it out for Kumar.

Waiting outside the examination hall window, Kumar would then write the answers on the fake sheets, put a serial number and supply back the sheets through the grill 15 minutes before the examination ended.

The forgery came to light when Kumar had been late in delivering the answersheet and Kailash had submitted the original one.

The examiner had noticed an extra answersheet in the bundle and detected the fraud. The accused had later tried to destroy all the proofs. Kailash died during the trail and Khushi Ram also lost his son, who was suffering from mental imbalance. For a father, there could be no greater punishment.

5,New medical seat list out amid protests,"KOLKATA: The state health department on Saturday published a list of 150 candidates for admission to MBBS courses at SSKM Hospital and Midnapore. However, the recounselling of candidates, who were selected earlier, was greeted by protests by guardians and members of the Medical Service Centre on Saturday.

Director of medical education C.R. Maity, who was present at Calcutta Medical College Hospital during the recounselling session, said the counselling for candidates selected for SSKM and Midnpaore would be held only after the â€œformalities for starting the colleges are completeâ€�. MSC member Bigyan Bera, however, alleged that the publication of the list of 150 candidates was illegal because the MCI hadnâ€™t granted its sanction for these courses.

â€œThatâ€™s not all, the total number of vacant general seats is around 74 â€” 56 earlier vacancies and 18 seats from the CBSE category. The state government has issued a list of only 35. We want to know where the rest of the seats have gone,â€� he added. â€œUnder section 10A of the Indian Medical Council Act 1956 no list of candidates can be published without the MCIâ€™s permission. This (list) is in gross violation of the law, unethical and against public interest,â€� said Bera.

Guardians and activists demonstrated in front of the principalâ€™s office. There was heavy police arrangement to prevent any incident. Parents alleged that they had been heckled by the police. The demonstrations continued throughout the day.

6,Love ke liye violence karega,"MUMBAI: Some people would like Kavita Lakhani, 25, to believe sheâ€™s a victim of â€˜â€˜too much loveâ€™â€™. The only words she remembers from the hour-long horror session on September 7 when her ex-boyfriend Nikhil Daswani, 27, allegedly bashed her up and tried to strangle her with a telephone cord, are his repeated utterances that he loved her.

Three weeks later, the blood clots and bruises may have healed, but Lakhani is still reeling from the after-effects of this disastrous passion. She hasnâ€™t stepped out of her house, except to meet her lawyer or the police. Sheâ€™s lodged an FIR against Daswani, heir to the Charagh Din group.

In these times of impatient relationships, the closest that nature comes to replicating such selfish love is the phenomenon of the female praying mantis devouring her partner after mating.

â€˜â€˜If we call ourselves humans, there is simply no justification for these so-called crimes of passion,â€™â€™ says Lakhani.

Hansa Patel, who had acid thrown on her earlier this week for turning down a marriage proposal, would agree. So too would Aparna Prabhu, whose face was scarred by acid in 1999 by a man who stalked her for eight years.

The Mumbai police concedes that violence perpetrated by â€˜Love ke liye kuch bhi karegaâ€™ has seen a rise.

â€˜â€˜Among the 800-odd cases of domestic violence registered, nearly 30 per cent are between youngsters involved in relationships,â€™â€™ a social service branch official says. Why do women always bear the brunt of such acts? â€˜â€˜You can blame that on our patriarchal society, where the man is not ready to handle any sort of rejection,â€™â€™ says Nandini Gandhi of Akshara, a Dadar-based womenâ€™s resource centre.

â€˜â€˜A denial is seen as an affront to the male ego. Men handle it in a very immature and dangerous manner,â€™â€™ she said.

Psychotherapist Charmayne Dâ€™Souza says, â€˜â€˜The fast-changing nature of society has impacted our lifestyles radically. Relationships are accepted, even encouraged, at a young age today. In fact, love is no longer a goal to be achieved. It is as accessible as instant coffee.â€™â€™

In her 13 years of counselling students at Wilson College, Dâ€™Souza has dealt with several such cases. â€˜â€˜Very often, youngsters get into relationships for reasons other than compatibility,â€™â€™ she says. When problems crop up, they cannot share them with their parents. And sometimes, these youngsters, who worship the rage-filled Eminens and Salman Khans, resort to violence to settle scores.

Film-maker Paromita Vohra says that age has little to do with violence. Be it a husband-and-wife couple or college sweethearts, there exists a power equation in every relationship. â€˜â€˜Violence is a consequence of the equation being unsettled,â€™â€™ she says.

The only way to bring this to an end is for more women to stand up against such violence, says Lakhani. Her mailbox is flooded with e-mails from concerned friends and women who have suffered; sheâ€™s even considering starting a support group. â€˜â€˜The message that nobody can get away with such an act has to be sent out loud and clear.â€™â€™

7,"Amarmani seeks bail, wife seeks stay on arrest","LUCKNOW: Madhumani, wife of former minister Amarmani Tripathi, has filed a writ petition, seeking stay of her arrest in the Madhumita Shukla murder case in the Lucknow Bench of the Allahabad High Court here on Saturday. The writ petition is likely to be heard on Monday.

Madhumani has challenged the validity of the FIR lodged at Mahanagar police station in connection with Madhumita Shukla murder case and has prayed for the quashing of this aforesaid report.

The petitioner has further requested to stay her arrest in this matter.

The CBI had conducted raids at a number of places to apprehend Madhumani.

The slain poetess'' sister had alleged immediately after her murder that it was perpetrated at the behest of Madhumani, who did not like Tripathi''s ""affair with Madhumita."" She had, however, retracted her statement later.

Madhumani had on Wednesday last moved a surrender application in the court of CBI magistrate Yadav, who directed the investigating agency to submit a detailed report on the case. The application is likely to be taken up for hearing on September 30. The CBI had already questioned Madhumani in the case twice. After the arrest of Tripathi, CBI sources had not ruled out arrest of other people, including his family members.

Meanwhile, Amarmani Tripathi has moved a bail application before the judicial magistrate (CBI) R M Yadav. The bail application was moved by his counsel VK Shahi which is likely to be heard on Monday.

Shahi has also moved another application for summoning the case diary and other collected evidences by the CBI against the accused.

In the bail plea Tripathi claimed he was innocent and that there was no evidence to link him with the murder of Madhumita, the lawyer said.

He alleged that ""Tripathi has been arrested for the purpose of harassment"". Tripathi was arrested on September 21 after his DNA samples matched that of the foetus of the slain poetess.

He was remanded to judicial custody till October 6 by the CBI court which later allowed the investigating agency to have his custody for seven days from September 23. Madhumita was shot dead at her Paper Mill colony residence here on May 9.

8,RBI may not cut bank rate in Oct policy,"NEW DELHI: Further reduction in RBI''s bank rate is unlikely from the present 6.0 per cent in the busy season credit policy in October end, but prime lending rates of major commercial banks may see a downward movement.

Although Reserve Bank has been asserting that ""soft interest rate bias"" would continue, bankers see no necessity in further reduction in Reserve Bank''s benchmark refinance rate as there was excess liquidity in the system.

""Bank rate cut is not necessary. But it all depends on RBI, which has so far maintained a soft interest rate bias,"" HDFC Bank managing director Aditya Puri said.

RBI had slashed bank rate by 0.25 per cent to 6.0 per cent in its slack season Credit Policy in April, while lowering repo rate by 0.50 per cent last month.

Although bank rate has been reduced significantly in the last five years, PLRs of banks continue to be in the range of 10-11 per cent.

To make PLRs realistic, RBI along with Indian Banks Association is working on a ""Benchmark PLR"" for banks, which may result in 1-2 per cent reduction in the lending rates of some of the banks who are charging borrowers a much higher rate now.

The benchmark PLR would be based on various parameters like actual cost of funds, operating expenses and gross non-performing assets of banks, Oriental Bank of Commerce chairman B D Narang said.

Each bank would have its own benchmark PLR based on various financial parameters. Ultimately it would benefit the borrowers, a top UCO Bank official said.

RBI had announced in April credit policy that the benchmark PLR based on a bank''s actual cost of funds, operating expenses, cost of capital, default premium (or NPA) and term premium and profit margin, would make lending rates realistic.

The benchmark PLR will be introduced in place of tenor-linked PLR, which RBI decided to discontinue.

RBI plans to review the system of determination of benchmark PLR by banks and actual prevailing spreads between lending and deposit rates in September.

The central bank has floated the idea of benchmark PLR considering the rate cut war amongst banks irrespective of their financial health.

Sources said that banks having a lower cost of funds could be able to offer a lower PLR than other banks.

""While there is little room for improving the cost of capital and default premium, banks can reduce their cost of borrowing,"" a banker said.

Operating cost, which was yet another parameter to adjudge the benchmark PLR, was expected to rise putting pressure on banks to raise the lending rates, the banker added.

The benchmark PLR would enable a borrower to get a more realistic rate of interest on its loans, the banker said.

""I feel as if Gujarat is doing all this (Vibrant Gujarat celebrations) to send out a deliberate message to the rest of the world. I say, it is a deliberate message because it is, among other things, meant to counter the sustained propaganda and by extension, against India - being conducted at home and abroad,"" Advani said while delivering the inaugural speech at the Vibrant Gujarat Global Investors Summit.

Urging investors not to be swayed by last year''s propaganda against Gujarat, Advani said that the state would learn the right lessons and move ahead.

""Do not believe in and do not be swayed by all that you have been reading about Gujarat in the past year or so. Yes, a sad and unfortunate episode took place. But it was an aberration,"" he said.

""Gujarat will learn the right lessons from it and will move ahead,"" he said, adding the state would not let the ""deliberate, motivated and continuing"" attempts to sully its image, tar its reputation and hurt its self-respect to succeed.

Following the riots, questions were being raised about the country being secular and this line of questioning was damaging not just the state but the country as well, he said.

""I consider it as an insult to me, to India and my understanding of India,"" he said.

On Indo-Pakistan relationship, Advani said that he had told President Pervez Musharraf at the time of Agra visit that the BJP government offered the best opportunity for resolving outstanding issues.

13,Virbhadra lauds employees' role in development of state,"SHIMLA: Chief minister Virbhadra Singh on Sunday said that the employees had contributed their best for the development of the state, specially those posted in the tribal, hard and difficult areas, and the Congress government in its last tenure had reciprocated by giving financial benefits amounting to Rs 850 crores, over and above the pay and allowances.

Addressing members of the Himanchal government and semi-government drivers and conductors association on the occasion of ''abhinandan samaroh'' organised by them in his honour, he said that the welfare of the employees had always remained on the priorty agenda of his government.

He said that he had always settled various demands of the employees by finding amicable solutions with mutual discussions, as they were the backbone of the government and played a significant role in implementation of its policies and programmes.

The chief minister said that his government had inherited a heavy debt of Rs 1500 crores from the previous government, purely due to its financial mismanagement. ""The government will be taking expert advice from the experienced national Congress leadership, on how to bail out the state our from its present financial crunch"", he added.

16,BJP opposes increase in height of Almatti dam,"HYDERABAD: The state unit of BJP has opposed the proposal to increase the height of the Almatti dam to let Mahabubnagar district get water on gravity basis.

Strongly objecting the stand of TRS president K Chandrasekhar Rao on increasing the height of the dam, the BJP state vice president S V Seshagiri Rao on Sunday told reporters that the raise in the height would increase the surface area of the reservoir which would result in evaporation of more than 22 tmc ft of water.

""The proposal of bringing Krishna waters on gravity basis would create problems. Without irrigating thousands of acres between Javargi in Karnataka to Mahabubnagar district, water could not be brought as there was little quantum of water available for further irrigated acreage,"" he said.

Rao, however, said that implementation of scheme B of the Bachawat tribunal would help resolve inter-state water disputes. Moreover, completion of all the pending and proposed lift irrigation schemes in the state and bringing water from the Godavari basin to Krishna basin, would bail out the state from water problems he said.

BJP general secretary K Laxman said that party would conduct its two-day Chintan Bhaitak here from October 9. The party national president M Venkaiah Naidu, union ministers from the state, legislators and party senior members would attend the meet, he said.

Meanwhile, minister of state for urban development and poverty alleviation Bandaru Dattatreya in a separate press meet reiterated that the proper use of Godavari waters would help the state in mitigating the water shortage. State unit of Janata Dal too opposed the proposal of increasing the height of the Almatti dam.

17,VMC Standing Committee Chairman polls on Monday,"VADODARA: Its time for some action at the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) as the race for the post of the standing committee chairman gears up. The elections will be held on Monday.

Apart from the chairman Bharat Shah, the term of five out of the 12 members is ending this month and will have to be replaced. They include JD(U) candidates Ashok Pawar and Liyaqat Ali, BJP members Ranjan Bhatt, city mayor NV Patel and Ashok Pardesi.

Candidates in the fray for the chairman''s post are standing committee member Praveen Patel, BJP councillor from Sayajigunj Ajit Patel, RSS member Vilas Surve and BJP councilor and chairman of the town planning committee Vandana Kode . Interestingly, most of these were also vying for the mayor''s post as well and were very much in the race till the elections in April.

Insiders in the BJP swear by Praveen Patel''s candidature for his close allegiance with BJP MLA from Sayajigunj Jitu Sukhadia. According to senior party leaders Sukhadia has been closely associated with most policy decisions of the present committee and has always sought Patel''s consent on important financial matters of the VMC.

Ajit Patel, who is next in line has been a favourite pick amongst fellow BJP councillors. His failure at the mayoral polls despite enjoying considerable clout in the VMC had to submit before the powerful Mehsana lobby of NV Patel, the present city mayor. The incident took the wind off the political ambitions of Ajit who later stopped coming to the VMC, except to attend general body meetings.

""There is nothing wrong if one finds my name doing rounds for the present standing committee elections,"" says BJP councillor Ajit Patel. ""Ultimately it is the party which decides. If the party finds me fit enough to head the team I have no qualms,"" adds Patel.

When asked if the new committee which is to be constituted in October will see induction of members from the opposition Congress, a senior BJP member replies, ""This is not possible. Just for the simple reason that in 1993 when few BJP members, including former MLA Jaspal Singh resigned from the committee, the Congress made sure that it wipes out further representation from our party. We will do the same,"" adds the member.

18,State govt to form water regulatory panel,"GANDHINAGAR: In an effort to refurbish its reformist image, the state government has decided to set up a Gujarat Water Regulatory Commission which will fix water tariff for different categories of consumers.

The Gujarat Infrastructure Development Board, an inter-departmental body, had earlier this week cleared a draft bill to set up the panel on the lines of Gujarat Electricity Regulatory Commission.

Significantly, the decision to have such a commission was first mooted in 1999 when former chief minister Keshubhai Patel put out a three-volume â€˜Gujarat Infrastructure Agenda: Vision 2010â€™, which envisaged 75 per cent private participation in infrastructure projects. The idea of having the commission resurfaced in the draft water policy prepared last year. The draft policy had stressed on a â€œrational water pricing policyâ€�.
