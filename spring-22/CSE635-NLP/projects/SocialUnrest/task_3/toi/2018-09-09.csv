0,Vajpayee has stood by farmers: Badal,"chandigarh: the increase in the minimum support price by the centre has been welcomed by punjab chief minister parkash singh badal but criticised by the congress party in both punjab and haryana. ''i deeply appreciate the concern of prime minister atal behari vajpayee for the hardworking farmers of punjab,who has, despite serious opposition from all quarters, even within his government and in the face of suggestions to reduce the msp because of the prevailing stock levels, firmly stood by the punjab farmer by giving us an increase of rs 20 per quintal of paddy,"" badal said in a statement here. on the other hand, the congress party, both in haryana and punjab, has criticised the ""meagre"" increase in msp for paddy. haryana pradesh congress committee (hpcc) president bhupinder singh hooda said the rs 20 increase in msp for paddy was a ''joke"" on the farmers and this coupled with the delayed announcement of the increase in msp had greatly disappointed them. ''the nda government at the centre and the chautala government in the state are pursuing policies which are detrimental to the interests of the farmers,"" hooda said in a statement here. punjab congress spokesman surendra singla said the badal government, despite its tall claims, had failed to get a substantial hike in the msp of paddy. hooda said farmers in haryana had got their worst treatment from the chautala government. last year's relief of rs 38 crore to farmers announced by chautala has proved to be a mirage. on friday, the centre had announced msp for paddy and other coarse grains based on the recommendations of the commission for agricultural costs and prices (cacp). the change in the msp regime, whereby greater increases in msp for coarse grains have been announced as compared to paddy, are designed to wean away farmers from the traditional wheat and paddy crop cycle as there exists a massive surplus of the latter two crops at the moment.

1,"With an eye on civic polls, CM rushes village merger issue","pune:the contentious issue of delinking fringe villages from the pune municipal corporation (pmc) is all set to flare up once again with chief minister vilasrao deshmukh directing the urban development secretaries and civic officials concerned to submit their final say in the matter at a special meeting to be held on september 10. pune divisional commissioner umeshchandra sarangi, who had submitted a report on de-linking of fringe villages, is expected to make a detailed presentation at the meeting. in his report he is believed to have recommended the de-linking of 12 out of 38 villages that were merged in the pmc four years ago. municipal commissioner t.c. benjamin, who too has been invited for the meeting, is expected to oppose the de-linking proposal, as the civic general body has unanimously resolved that all 38 fringe villages should remain in the pmc limits. though the de-linking issue is expected to be sorted out on september 10, a formal announcement about the decisions taken during the meeting will be made only after september 25, the sources said, pointing that the code of conduct for by-elections in the daund legislative assembly segment is effective for the entire pune district till september 24. meanwhile, the pmc's election office, which had completed the tedious process of demarcation the new municipal wards for the february 2002 elections, has been forced to undertake the entire exercise afresh. the election office has demarcated 131 municipal wards on the basis of the 1991 census, and has forwarded the demarcation maps to the state election commission. the state cabinet has, however, resolved that the pmc should conduct the municipal elections as per the 2001 census, and accordingly demarcate 146 municipal wards. the pmc's election officers have already started the work but are faced with possibility that some the fringe villages may get delinked from the pmc. if the villages get de-linked, the population would reduce and subsequently the wards would reduce. we may be forced to undertake the demarcation exercise once again, a pmc election officer said. the election commissioner has strongly asserted that the pmc elections will be held as per schedule, february 2002.

8,Govt mulls on export subsidies for farm products,"new delhi: the government is preparing a scheme to provide wto compatible support for export of agricultural commodities in order to make up for the lower international prices, which had rendered india's agri-exports incompetitive, union agriculture minister ajit singh said on sunday. ""under the proposed scheme, which is being worked out keeping in mind the existing regulations of the world trade regime, the government will give wto compatible export subsidies for agricultural products. it will give a fillip to the trade in the sector"", singh said. he added that high volume of export subsidies by the developed nations had ensured that the international prices of various agri-items remained depressed, making india incompetitive. it was visible in the case of non-basmati rice, where india was being outpriced by thailand and vietnam, he added. elaborating on the proposed scheme, he said that subsidies could be adjusted in the freight category, which was wto permissible unlike price subsidies which were not allowed. justifying such subsidies, singh said that instead of reducing theirs, developed nations had actually increased them taking advantage of the ""boxes"" permitted under the wto regime. on the other hand, developing nations like india found it difficult to pay the subsidies they were eligible under wto due to the bad financial health of their economies. he further said that it was this objective of promoting export of agri products that a proposal for removing restrictions on their trade had been sent to the cabinet. singh said that if the proposal was approved, there would be no quantitative ceiling on agri-exports, packaging restrictions would be done away with and canalisation through state trading enterprises (stes) would not be needed. ""traders could directly export their consignments, without routing them through stes or getting registration certificates from agricultural products and processed foods exports development authority (apeda),"" he said. this would make the products more competitive in the international market as neither would the exporter pay a cess to apeda nor commission to the ste. once export subsidies were in place it would be an additional bonus for agro-trade, he added. but the initiative had to come from the exporters themselves as government could only give incentives and not export on its own. even in the case of onions a high upward ceiling of seven lakh tonne annual export had been fixed, nearly double the actual export last year, thus facilitating shipments. when india decided to lessen the stocks with the food corporation of india by selling them to exporters at prices below the procurement cost, the developed world raised a ruckus saying it was against fair international trade. but they overlooked their own large subsidies both for domestic and export purpose, he added.

9,Shah says no to Assembly polls,"new delhi: ruling out his participation in assembly elections, senior separatist kashmiri leader shabir ahmed shah on sunday said polls should be held in jammu and kashmir to choose the ""true representatives"" of the people who are capable of negotiating for the future of the state. ""we are not against elections. but elections to choose government have failed in settling the kashmir issue,"" shah, who heads jammu and kashmir democratic freedom party (jkdfp), said here, a day after chief minister farooq abdullah claimed that shah and some other separatist leaders were ready to contest the coming elections. demanding that elections be held to choose the true representatives of the people of jammu and kashmir who could hold talks on behalf of the people, shah said these polls should be held under supervision of saarc or intellectuals of india and pakistan ""as we have lost faith in the government of india"". seeking to justify his argument, he said at present claims are being made by various groups to be the true representatives of the people of kashmir and ""such elections will settle the controversy and confusion."" stating that he was ready to contest such polls, shah said parties like national conference and other ""pro-freedom movement"" groups should also test their popularity at the hustings. he also suggested that prime minister atal bihari vajpayee should talk to these ""true leaders"" to see how the problem could be solved. alleging that custodial deaths were going on at the hands of special task force (stf) of jammu and kashmir police, shah said ""killings should end as talks and violence cannot go together."" the separatist leader regretted that his suggestions to centre's interlocutor k c pant had not been implemented so far and warned that ""sidelining of kashmiris will never help solve the 54-year-old issue"". ""the government of india should create an atmosphere for talks and infuse confidence in kashmiris that promises would no longer be broken,"" he said. hailing the agra summit as a good beginning, he said more groundwork could be done when prime minister atal bihari vajpayee and pakistan president pervez musharraf meet in new york later this month. ""we hope the obstacles seen in agra are not witnessed at new york,"" shah said and expressed optimism that the subsequent visit by external affairs minister jaswant singh to islamabad would bring the two countries more closer. shah is here to meet former prime ministers v p singh, i k gujral, some former foreign secretaries, a few mps, journalists and human rights activists, besides ambassadors of some countries during his 10-day stay.

11,Crop insurance policy reform on anvil,"konda gaon: union finance minister yashwant sinha on sunday said the centre was considering to reform the current crop insurance policy and make it more farmer-friendly. ""the centre is determined to make the crop insurance policy more farmer-friendly, besides expanding its uses, to strengthen the financial condition of the vast rural people depending upon agriculture,"" sinha said here. ""centre is working on the further refinement of the crop insurance policy,"" he said. the minister said he had detailed discussions with the then agriculture minister nitish kumar and the issue is being discussed with the new incumbent, ajit singh. the policy needed attention for the reason that it has a limited scope as per the crop losses are concerned and the farmer has not been covered for any other losses, he said. ""when an individual could be covered against any individual loss why not the farmers,"" the union minister asked favouring further smaller division of area as a single unit to give better assurance for any crop damage. stressing for reform in crop insurance, sinha said during his discussion with insurance sector officials he had also suggested that individual farmers should be treated as a single unit against the current practice of whole revenue block or tehsil. ""but i was told that was not be possible considering all aspects,"" he said. however, instead of any revenue block or tehsil as a unit to evaluate the extent of crop damage, it is being considered to take one village as a single unit, while working on its refinement, the finance minister said. he said the ministry also had talks with several chief ministers and appealed to the state governments to offer suggestions on the issue. later speaking at a function to distribute kisan credit card at jagdalpur, bastar, the minister said the centre was determined not to allow any distress sale of paddy and other foodgrains in the country. the centre would provide sufficient assistance so that no farmers should, out of compulsion, sell their agro-products outside the grain markets and at a rate below the official price, he added.

13,BSEB in a fix over minister-JSEB chief feud,"patna: the internal rift in the jharkhand government has put the bihar state electricity board (bseb) in a dilemma. maverick power minister of jharkhand lal chand mahto has again given rise to a controversy -- this time by opposing the move of jharkhand state electricity board (jseb) chairman rajib ranjan to get about 100 personnel from the bseb deputed at ranchi. according to informed sources in the bseb, ranjan met bseb chairman c m jha at patna on september 2 and asked him to depute about 100 bseb personnel at the jseb headquarters. he pleaded that the jseb headquarters currently have only 14 personnel, including the chairman and board members, making it impossible for the board to function. in contrast, the bseb has as many as 2,250 staff members at its headquarters. ranjan requested jha to send about 100 staff from the bseb to ranchi on deputation immediately, suggesting that only those staff should be sent who have already opted for jharkhand. jha, who was reportedly sympathetic to the demand of his jharkhand counterpart, asked him to send a proposal to this effect as also the list of persons he wanted to be sent on deputation. on september 5, the jseb chairman sent a list of 95 persons he wanted to be posted in jharkhand. even before the bseb chairman had time to react, the jharkhand power minister sent a letter to his bihar counterpart shakeel ahmad khan declaring that the written request of the jseb chairman was illegal. ""the jseb chairman's letter does not have the approval of the government of jharkhand,"" mahto insisted. a copy of the same letter was sent to the bseb chairman too. mahto's letter has put the bseb authorities in a fix over the proposal although they appear to enjoy the internal bickerings after having a prolonged fight with the jharkhand government on several issues, including the division of bseb manpower. the jharkhand government is insisting on population as the basis of distribution of manpower while the bihar government is pressing for power consumption as the basis as already approved by the srivastava committee. meanwhile, the jseb chairman is reported to have stuck to his letter, insisting that there was nothing wrong in asking for staff on deputation as the board is an autonomous body. mahto had a running battle with the then power secretary of the state, r s poddar, and finally managed to get him transferred to another department.

15,CM urged to waive farmers' loans,"hubli: bjp leader b.s. yediyurappa has urged chief minister s.m. krishna to waive the loans of small and marginal farmers, in view of severe drought situation in the state. speaking to reporters here on saturday, yediyurappa lambasted chief minister krishna for ``turning a blind eye'' towards the reality and relying on the statistics reeled out by officials. in a scathing attack on the state government, yediyurappa said, krishna and his colleagues had failed to gauge the drought situation in state and alleged, the state government was ``unnecessarily'' trying to blame the centre by spreading canards that they had not received aid. yediyurappa said the central government had already released 1 lakh tonne of foodgrain for distribution under `food for work' scheme, besides 2 lakh tonne of fodder-related grains. ``the situation is volatile and if the government does not act swiftly, the farmers may take to streets and create a law-and-order problem,'' he warned. he said, out of rs 78 crore received under the calamity relief fund, only rs 5 crore had been spent, and that too mostly on drinking water schemes. yediyurappa urged the chief minister to keep politics aside and form a committee consisting of local people belonging to various parties to monitor the drought relief work. pointing to the statement by a senior offical that the present drought was severe than the one in 1972, yediyurappa asked if the ministers were aware of it. ridiculing krishna's statement that the government was running a three-legged race with non-cooperating officials, yediyurappa said, this showed krishna's lack of control over the bureaucracy. the bjp leader was also critical of karnataka revenue minister h.c. srikantaiah for his ``laxity'' in assessing the situation and initiate remedial measures. yediyurappa warned that the bjp would stage a symbolic dharna in front of the vidhana soudha to protest the apathy of the government towards the drought situation and then apprise the governor of the same. mlc ramachandra gowda, farmers' leader ishwarachandra hosamani and district bjp president prahlad joshi were present.

16,Interpol's help sought to arrest Dawood's aide,"mumbai: the city police have asked interpol to issue an alert for aftab batki (38), who allegedly operates the multi-crore counterfeit currency notes racket in india from his hideout in dubai.

batki is a trusted lieutenant of karachi-based dawood ibrahim and works on behalf of the inter- services intelligence (isi) of pakistan, senior officers alleged.

while the mumbai police have managed to clip batki''s wings by arresting several of his associates and seizing notes worth rs three crore over the last two years, they believe that the only solution would be for the interpol to arrest him in dubai.

on friday, the crime branch arrested abdul suleman an alleged batki-aide at the santa cruz airport for reportedly possessing rs 20 lakhs in fake currency. the notes were in the denomination of rs 500. but suleman''s arrest will not affect batki who will recruit a fresh agent either in dubai or mumbai, a police officer said.

""for example, in 1996, he had recruited a leather businessman in dubai to work for him. the businessman, shaukat farooqui, was arrested by the mumbai police in 1997. but following his arrest, batki approached shaukat''s brother gufran and inducted him into his gang,"" the officer stated.

the police said that batki was aware of the smuggling routes since the early eighties. ""between 1982 and 1985, he used to smuggle imported goods and gold into india. he had a good network at the mumbai airport and knew some of the customs officials,"" an officer said. ""dawood was so impressed with this youth from pakhmodia street that he took him to dubai and assigned him the job of supervising smuggling operations for the gang. when isi sought dawood''s help to smuggle counterfeit notes into india, he appointed batki as the ring leader in the racket. since then, batki is feared to have smuggled in counterfeit notes worth over rs five crore into india,"" the officer noted.

the modus operandi of isi agents was to reportedly smuggle the notes from pakistan to dubai and conceal them in clay jars, toys and aluminium foil boxes. the notes were later concealed in water dispensers and tv sets before being sent to mumbai by air. after the consignment landed at the mumbai airport, it was left untouched. ""some airport officials handed it over to members of the dawood gang waiting outside the airport,"" an officer alleged. the police are still to identify these airport officials.

the smuggled notes were circulated among sub-agents in mumbai, other parts of maharashtra, gujarat, bihar and andhra pradesh, sources said. the sub-agents usually paid rs 40 for a rs 100 counterfeit note. the money was then routed to pakistan through the hawala route and was used for funding isi operations, police sources alleged.

according to mumbai police commissioner m.n. singh, the main aim was to sabotage the indian economy and create confusion.

the police have cautioned residents and businessmen to verify notes of rs 500 and rs 100 denomination before accepting them. some of the rbi guidelines are: * a genuine note will contain a security thread which will contain the words `bharat'' in devanagri script and `rbi'' appearing alternatively.

* on the right hand side of mahatma gandhi''s picture, one can see a thick vertical band. it shows the denomination value. the value can be seen only when the note is held on the palm and the light is allowed to fall on the vertical and at 45 degrees.

* the picture of mahatma gandhi, rbi seal, guarantee and promise clauses, ashoka pillar emblem, rbi governor''s signature are embossed and can be felt by touch in the genuine notes.

19,"Global meet to discuss AIDS, laws and ethics","bangalore: a research programme on `hiv/aids: laws, ethics and human rights concerns' is on the agenda of the sixth international congress on aids in asia and the pacific (icaap) to be held in melbourne from october 5 to 10. the programme is conducted by the institute of legal ethics and medicine (tilem), which is part of the national law school of india university, and the unit of hiv and development (for south and south-west asia) of united nations development programme (undp). the project has been envisaged to trigger region-specific legal and ethical debates to structure possible initiatives that aim at arresting the further spread of hiv. the project has in its jurisdiction neighbouring countries like nepal, sri lanka, bangladesh and india. speaking to the times of india, project coordinator prof. s.v. joga rao of tilem, who will launch the research programme in melbourne, said: ``the problem of hiv/aids is accentuated by the dual aspects of incurability of the disease as coupled with societal response towards the person who is tested positive. the solution to the problems should be applied in the cultural context and the social reality that prevails in the respective jurisdiction.'' the timing of the research project and the consequent discussions in this regard were marked with relevance owing to the introduction of aids prevention bills in karnataka and maharashtra legislatures. according to joga rao, tilem and undp recognised that it was a significant moment to undertake a research project that has an outcome that shall prevent the reproduction of western models of hiv/aids regulation in the specific cultural context prevailing in india. tilem responded to this challenge through the adoption of the following three research processes as being fundamental for granting legitimacy to the research outcomes. they include consultations with doctors, nurses, students, media, ngos, commercial sex workers, hospital administrators, policy makers, judicial officers, police and prison officials, trade unions, dentists, sexual minorities, women and child activists. therefore, collecting data to understand the contextual clarity of cultural factors became necessary, he said. tilem will also be assisting karnataka and any other interested state on structuring and firming up of policy. tilem hopes to get a positive nod from government, particularly in view of the fact that chief minister s.m. krishna heads the karnataka state aids prevention society.

21,"Next, pigs could trigger farmer suicides","haveri: reeling under debts and unable to pay them off, every fortnight, one farmer is committing suicide in karnataka. the elected representatives are unable to help the families of the deceased except visit their houses and express their `sympathy'. compared to last year, the number of suicides this year have increased. in haveri district, half a dozen farmers have committed suicide since march 2001. though farmers are worried about crop failure due to poor rainfall, in some areas of the district, there are standing crops which may fetch them some income. as of now, farmers are facing another problem; that of pig menace. pigs have been destroying crops in haveri. last week, basavaraj bheemappa chitagi (18) died when he came in contact with a live wire. naganagouda patil had placed a live wire around his field to prevent pigs from coming to his fields. farmers who have fields in the outskirts of the town have now approached the deputy commissioner k.janardhan rao to prevent further loss of crop due to pig menace. in a memorandum addressed to the district deputy commissioner, they said, if action is not taken to control the menace, then farmers will start committing suicide because of it. the copy of the memorandum was signed by a farmer s.k. talawar and others and was submitted to superintendent of police (sp). now, the ball is in the court of the district administration. one can only wait and watch how the administration combats pig menace.

22,Alternative govt needed: Raitha Sangha,"davanagere: karnataka rajya raitha sangha (krrs) chief prof m.d. nanjundaswamy said an ``alternative government'' is need of the hour as the government headed by s m krishna in the state is ``dead''. he told reporters here on wednesday that the tussle between farmers and the government is on and the laws don't favour them. prof. swamy said krrs and green army are organising the world farmers' day in bangalore on october 2 to discuss problems of farmers and those related to wto. farmers' representatives from across the world are expected to attend the meet. ``the state is reeling under severe drought, prices of agriculture products have slumped, purchasing power of farmers has declined and suicide cases of farmers are increasing by the day,'' he said. instead of visiting drought-hit regions and preparing reports, the government must conduct a scientific analysis of the loss incurred to crops, including paddy, maize and cotton. swamy said the government must analyse quantum of loan extended to farmers. ``why should there be a difference in the power supply between rural and urban sectors and why is subsidy given only to electric industries,'' he questioned. ``we don't believe in installing electric meters for agriculture.'' on the kudremukh mining, swamy said the problem can't be solved by submitting a memorandum to authorities. ``instead, the people must stage a dharna.''

23,No laws to net cyber stalkers,"new delhi: may 1 started with an obscene call in 15-year-old pinky's house. the caller wanted to have sex with her. it was the first of many. it appeared that someone had put up her name and phone number at a dating website, portraying her as a young woman who wanted casual sex. but though complaints were made, there seemed no law yet that can punish the culprit. pinky's is not an unusual case. cyber stalking and e-mail harassment are growing popular by the day. reason: unlike the 'high-profile' cyber crimes - hacking, damaging of source code and such - these take little expertise. anyone who can send an e-mail can do these. it is no surprise that these comprise the bulk of cyber crimes committed both in india and abroad. in the last six months, delhi police alone have filed about 20 complaints, says acp, cyber crime cell, rajan bhagat. double of that could be going unreported. yet more cases come through private channels to the central bureau of investigation, says a cbi source. despite the low figures, the country is certainly following the international trend. the nua internet surveys estimate that by 2003, if even one per cent of net users have been stalked once, the number will be around 5 million. and still, the government is yet to wake up. the it laws, which were passed after nearly two years of lengthy and arduous legislation process, makes no mention of this. in fact, they were framed with little in mind but boosting e-commerce, says lawyer pavan duggal. the new cyber stalking section, section 66, that has been included in the draft of the cyber convergence bill, was added as an afterthought. this one provides for punitive measures, including up to three years of imprisonment and a fine of up to rs 2 crore and covers cyber stalking, harassment and allied crimes. but the law lies a long way into future. the cyber convergence bill is yet to come up before parliament and it is anyone's guess when the specific legislation would be made. till then, such cases are at the mercy of the outdated ipc. compare this to the situation in europe and the states, where laws have been updated long ago. in fact, in the us, not only a separate section has been included in the federal laws, but more than half the states have passed legislation regarding cyber stalking. one reason, says t k vishwanathan, member secretary of the law commission, is that enacting legislation is always an uphill task. handing over more power to the law enforcement agencies always leave room for the abuse of that power. as such, the legislators have to see whether the benefits of the law are high enough to outweigh the pitfalls involved. but for victims like pinky, such debates are fruitless. whatever light lies at the end of the tunnel, seems far too away to give them any possible succour.

24,BJP launches election campaign for BCC elections,"bangalore: union urban development minister ananth kumar on sunday criticised the state government for resorting to load-shedding and accused it of causing misery to citizens. launching the bjp's campaign for the forthcoming elections to the bangalore city corporation (bcc), kumar said the state government had been shortsighted and had robbed industries of their incomes through this measure. ``it has given citizens a shock treatment. i have told the cm on numerous occasions that the city needs a dedicated power plant but my suggestions were never taken seriously,'' he stated. taking potshots at chief minister s.m. krishna, kumar remarked, ``he is more worried about singapore and the rich rather than the middle class and the poor. what has this government done for the 12 lakh poor slum dwellers of the city? if the previous janata dal government was a monkey, this government is a donkey. only we are for the people.'' terming krishna's statment on making bangalore into singapore a pipe dream, kumar said, ``my dream is more realistic - that of making bangalore into what kempe gowda envisaged for it.'' he also urged the state government and the bcc to take joint responsibility for the creation 1,000 toilets for which he had announced a sum of rs 100 crore during the recent batf review meeting in the city. he also launched a people's awareness campaign on the occasion in which two bedecked chariots will tour all the 100 wards in the city by october 14 highlighting the centre's achievements as well as focussing on the state government's shortcomings where city governance is concerned. mlas suresh kumar, r. ashok, k.n. subba reddy and mlc vimala gowda were also present on the occasion.

26,UP prisons spilling over due to lawyers' strike,"noida: prisons in 16 western uttar pradesh districts these days are choc-a-bloc full. many of these inmates are undertrials who have not been able to get a bail for even minor offences. the reason being the non- functioning of courts since independence day. the dasna jail in ghaziabad, which serves as the district jail for noida, too, is packed with inmates almost four times its capacity. things have reached a stage where some noida and ghaziabad police officials are reportedly postponing arrests in petty crimes. ``i do not see why an accused wanted for a minor case should have to be put up in an overcrowded jail with not even a lawyer available to plead bail for him. dasna jail, which can accommodate 660 people, has 2,400 occupants at present,'' said a noida police official. the present situation has arisen as lawyers from 16 districts have gone on strike to support their demand for setting up a up high court bench in the western part of the state. ``the lawyers plan to continue their strike at least up to september 16. on september 14 they have planned a western up bandh,'' said ghaziabad bar association secretary devraj singh. he said 6.5 lakh cases from western up were pending in allahabad high court and litigants had to travel even up to 700 kms to file a habeus corpus petition. meanwhile, in a move to ``protect the fundamental right of the eligible accused to liberty'', the gautam budh nagar and ghaziabad district judges and chief judicial magistrates have now started holding special courts in dasna jail. no counsel for the accused is required in these courts. gautam budh nagar district judge allah reham told the times of india on friday that he had heard 22 bail applications of 29 accused inside the jail. ``bail was granted to 20 of the accused on the merits of the cases,'' he said. he said the accused were being released on the spot on personal bonds where the cases seem ``frivolous or weak''. mr reham said the judges had an obligation to give a personal hearing to accused who could not get a counsel. ``the judges will try to welcome such accused for personal hearings even in the district courts,'' he added. he said for reducing the backlog, 32 bangladeshis arrested by noida police were immediately being deported. he agreed the lawyers' strike had added to the pressure on the already overcrowded dasna jail.
