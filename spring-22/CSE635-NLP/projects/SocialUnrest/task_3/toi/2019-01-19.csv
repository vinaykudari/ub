""i quit the cabinet because the bjp cheated us in the seat-sharing,"" he said. ""now we are going to field over 100 candidates in almost all the districts of state"", he said adding that lcp leaders, who were contesting the elections on the bjp symbol and those who had been allowed by the bjp to contest on the symbol of lcp, were free to take their decisions. the lcp chief said that before extending support to kalyan government the lcp had made an agreement with the bjp that in future the mlas of lcp would be allowed to contest from their respective constituencies either on the symbol of their own party or on the bjp's symbol. when rajnath singh assumed the charge, he also accepted this condition, he said. claiming that the state was heading for another hung assembly, he said that ""in future the bjp will never get the support of lcp"". admitting that the lcp had reached on the verge of another division, he said that ""now it has become clear why the bjp took such a long time to finalise the candidates' list."" he added that ""whenever i asked the cm about the cause of delay the latter stated that ajit singh of rld was mounting pressure for some seats of lcp"". but the delay was deliberate as they wanted to break the lcp, he said adding that he was punished because he had opposed the new kashi project of om prakash singh and veerbhadra mishra's proposal for the ganga action plan. he said that all the district and city units of party had been asked to propose the name of candidates. the final list of over 100 lcp candidates would be announced on january 21. replying to a query whether rajnath had tuned any `singh mantra' as almost all the lcp candidates, who had been allowed to contest on the bjp symbol, belonged to the same caste, he said to kya main siyar hoon.

2,Three SDOs debarred from election duty,"patna: the state election commission will not take poll-related work from three sub-divisional officers whose transfer it had recommended to the bihar government about four months ago. the sec has debarred them from participating in any election-related work in the ensuing local bodies polls and residuary panchayat polls. on the list of officials debarred from conducting elections, the names of seven district magistrates (dms) and 11 bihar administrative service (bas) officials figured. the ban was imposed as they were charged with being biased and negligent as also committing irregularities in conducting the panchayat polls last year. the three sdos who continue to hold their posts despite their transfer having been recommended by the sec are: biraul sdo (in darbhanga district) ramudgar mahto, udakishanganj sdo (in madhepura district) hiralal tanti and the simri bakhtiarpur sdo (in saharsa district). the five debarred dms have already been transferred on the sec's recommendation earlier while the issue relating to two others -- dms of east champaran and rohtas -- was settled with the state government compelling them to go on leave. the residuary panchayat polls in the state will be held on january 20 and so the presence of the dms of east champaran and rohtas during the polls was strongly objected to by the sec. sources said that out of the 11 bas officials debarred from conducting elections, many were suspended, some transferred and only a few remain on the posts from where their transfer was recommended by the sec. according to the sec's decision, such bas officials would not be given election work. some senior officials of the sec maintained that the commission has got no disciplinary powers to take action against state government officials committing irregularities while conducting polls. but for free and fair polls, recommendation for the transfer of such officials was imperative and so the sec took a tough stand against the state government in order to force it to give effect to its recommendation, they added. the reports alleging bias and election-related irregularities on the part of the said officials had been given by the respective dms conducting the panchayat polls in their capacity as district election officers. as the dms are also its servants, the state government must pay heed to their reports alleging election-related irregularities on the part of the officials concerned, the sec officials added.

5,Migration along border may hit Punjab polls,"chandigarh: with more than 2.25 lakh people having migrated from the border villages of punjab following the army's build-up, a big question mark hangs over the feasibility of holding the assembly elections there. the polls are less than a month away. official sources say that following the build-up, residents of at least 320 villages located along the 553-km stretch of the indo-pak border in the state have left their homes and moved to safer places. officials say they are skeptical about being able to conduct free and fair elections in the dozen affected assembly constituencies in the three border districts of gurdaspur, amritsar and ferozepur. they say that following the migration of a major chunk of the population, conducting elections in the border constituencies will not only be an arduous task but was fraught with the possibilities of large-scale irregularities. in amritsar district, 138 villages have been hit by largescale migrations, while the figures for gurdaspur and ferozepur districts are 133 and 60, respectively. patti sub-division of amritsar district is reported to have been the worst-hit with 86 per cent of the population migrating from its villages. gurdaspur follows next with over 70 per cent of villagers having vacated their houses. though the state government has set up relief camps, a majority of the displaced people are stated to have sought shelter with their relatives in nearby places. since the army is expected to stay along the border for some time, the officials admit that the people are unlikely to return to their villages in the near future. in fact, there are many villages where people cannot return for a long time since mines have been laid by the army. state additional chief electoral officer usha sharma said the election commission (ec) had not yet evolved any proposal to deal with the situation. she said the commission would initiate action only after the state government submitted an adverse report on the matter. nevertheless, poll observers, who are currently touring the border districts, are likely to review the situation and report the matter to the ec. chief minister prakash singh badal had denied last week that the government proposed to postpone elections in the affected constituencies. he had said the government was seized of the situation and would maintain a close watch. badal, however, had discounted speculation that the government intended to propose postponement of elections in the entire state in view of the tension prevailing on the border.

7,Game of upmanship in Haryana over SYL,"chandigarh: though it is still a long way to go before ravi-beas water flows into the fields of haryana through the sutlej-yamuna link (syl) canal, political parties, especially the ruling indian national lok dal (inld) and the congress, are already engaged in the game of one-upmanship in their bid to take credit for the petition that resulted in the supreme court ruling. in fact, even before the sc ruling, this battle of nerves among haryana politicians over the work done on the canal project used to be a permanent fixture of state's political scene both in and outside the assembly. ``the tragedy of our system is that the politicians think that their only job is to politicise issues for their vested interests overlooking national or state interests. look at our neighbours in punjab. they are at each other's throats as if the water has been given to pakistan,'' commented a senior haryana bureaucrat when asked if at all the water would reach the state. this game of one-upmanship is likely to get more pronounced in the next couple of weeks in the light of the coming yamunanagar assembly byelection. as luck would have it, the sc ruling in favour of haryana has come in handy for the ruling inld-bjp combine to blunt the congress onslaught against it over the new house tax policy and the recovery of power arrears. these two issues, in fact, generated so much public anger that the state government was forced to announce several concessions. but the opposition is itching to raise them once again in a big way during the byelection. what is more interesting is that the inld is busy giving credit for the favourable ruling of the apex court to the late devi lal, while the congress is giving this credit to the late indira gandhi and rajiv gandhi. but none of the parties has at this juncture bothered to remember the sacrifices made by common man for this cause. senior congress leader and former hpcc president shamsher singh surjewala points out: ``the matter of fact is that the late devi lal, om prakash chautala and their party had opposed all earlier agreements on the issue, including the rajiv-longowal agreement crafted by rajiv in 1985. devi lal had made scrapping of this accord an election issue in 1987. the eradi tribunal was constituted under this agreement which put the seal of haryana's right on ravi-beas waters. and this agreement has finally led to the sc verdict.'' both surjewala and other congress leaders claim that the petition, on which the sc has given its ruling, was filed by the congress government in 1995 when bhajan lal was the chief minister. hailing the sc verdict, chautala in his statement, however, claims: ``chaudhary devi lal had during his tenure as cm given rs 2 crore to the punjab government to construct the canal. when the punjab government did not start the construction work despite persistent efforts of chaudhary devi lal, who for the first time filed a civil suit in the sc on april 30, 1979.'' this case was, however, withdrawn by the congress government in 1982.

8,‘Ailing’ Laloo holds meet on eve of UP polls,"patna: ailing rjd chief laloo prasad yadav is very much active in politics even on the beur central jail premises. on thursday evening, rjd leaders from up — bhola singh, ashok singh and others — visited the jail to discuss the forthcoming up assembly elections with laloo. according to party sources, laloo has given the nod for filing nomination papers for 80 seats in the up polls. bihar ministers shivanand tiwari, shakuni choudhary and sitaram singh were also present in the meeting. rjd sources indicate that though laloo has given the nod for fielding 80 candidates in the polls, he is hoping to get 40 to 60 seats from the congress under an alliance. though the congress has stated that it would go alone in the up elections, the rjd is hoping for a last-minute understanding with it. according to party sources, the rjd leaders from up were not enthusiastic about a poll pact with the congress. the congress has no vajood (standing) in up, said a up rjd leader. the rjd supremo is reported to have lashed out at the up rjd leaders for their anti-congress stand. let me come out of the jail; i will expose the kafan chors (coffin thieves), he told them while insisting that the brahmins of up are progressive. he genuinely believes that the congress in up is under the control of brahmins, remarked an rjd minister while pointing out that bihar congress mlc neelambar choudhary was also present in the meeting. however, laloo is genuinely itching to snipe at the nda in general and george fernandes, whom he keeps on calling fraud fernandes, in particular. he told the rjd leaders from up that had it not been for america, vajpayee and fernandes would have waged a war against pakistan for votes in up, said an rjd leader. while ailing laloo is very much active in politics, his prolonged stay in the beur jail on health ground continues to irk his political opponents, who insist that the rjd chief should be in ranchi jail in jharkhand. the doctors of patna are too incompetent to look after laloo because he has continued to be ill for such a long time. he should be sent to the all india institute of medical sciences (aiims), delhi and examined by doctors there, remarked lok janshakti state chief narendra singh. they point to the electronic media images shown on january 14 of ailing laloo suffering from cervical and waist pain serving dahi in a heavy-looking bucket to the beur jail inmates on the occasion of makar sankranti. however, health ground is an old plea taken by laloo, said bjp leader sushil kumar modi while maintaining that he is now weary of issuing statements to this effect. but for now, rjd leaders are keeping their fingers crossed as laloo's bail petition will come up for hearing in the supreme court on monday.

9,4 Mahabodhi monks threaten suicide,"bodh gaya: in an alarming development less than 72 hours before the commencement of kalchakra prayers, the mega religious event of the tibetan buddhists, four monks deputed at strategic points, including the sanctum of the mahabodhi shrine, have gone on fast unto death and even threatened to commit suicide to register their protest against the alleged high-handedness and unbecoming conduct of the temple management committee (tmc) secretary kalicharan yadav. the names of the monks who have gone on fast unto death are bhadant mahanama, bhadant darshan deep, bhadant dhamma nand and bhadant deepankar. mahanama, spokesperson of the fasting monks, has accused yadav of defiling the sanctity of the place by open boozing on the tmc office premises almost daily in the evening. he also alleged that two of yadav's men assaulted darshan deep on the temple premises. all the four monks fearing threat to their lives have locked themselves inside their rooms on the first floor of the temple guest house and have refused to take anything. the frightened monks talked to this correspondent through the sole window opening in the corridor. asked about the allegation levelled by the fasting monks, yadav said the charge that he used to drink in the tmc office along with his associates and make scenes thereafter, is too outrageous to be responded. thank god, they have not accused him (yadav) of bringing girls to the tmc office, he added. regarding the allegation that darshan deep was assaulted at his instance, yadav said, i don't need outside support to assault someone. i am strong enough to do it myself, he observed. however, yadav conceded that darshan deep was assaulted by fellow monks bhadant rahul and bhadant ratan bodhi. but he has nothing to do with the incident, added yadav.

10,Corporates may tie up with Maharashtra farmers,"mumbai: so what does one do in times of financial drought, with it promises coming a cropper? turn to real crop and show investors how to reap a sunny harvest, if maharashtra's new policy tilt towards the agro sector is any indication. aiming at greater participation from the private players, the state government is working at a model plan which blends social cause with economics. from providing credit facilities to farmers to leasing farm equipment, from counselling on soil, seeds and related matters to processing of farm produce, a number of services could suddenly become easily available and affordable with corporate participation. farmers from vidarbha, marathwada, konkan and western maharashtra may soon be signing agreement papers with firms dealing in agro-inputs, insurance companies, banks, storage houses and food processing companies. the joint venture of this kind will be aimed at bringing assistance to the farmer's doorstep, say officials. a task force of state officials and top corporates is already working on the project. ``privately-run farmer service centres will be set up in villages involving corporate specialists to advise farmers on precision farming techniques. the centres will also house banks and insurance company personnel to financially aid the farmers. the processing companies will ensure that the produce is lifted from the field directly and stored, thus reducing costs,'' says an official. significantly, the idea is to do away with middlemen, who are often known to fleece cash-starved farmers desperate to sell off their yield, he says, adding that this would also reduce the market price of farm produce. ``as many as 65 per cent of the state's population is dependent on agriculture and 57.6 per cent of the land in maharashtra is under agriculture. a planned growth in this sector is directly related to growth in the manufacturing sector and stands to boost gdp,'' says another official. not surprisingly, chief minister vilasrao deshmukh, a farmer from the marathwada region, seems impressed by this concept, which is reportedly the brainchild of hindustan lever limited (hll) chairman m.s. banga. hll, in a joint venture with rallis and icici, has translated the idea into practice in hoshangabad district in central madhya pradesh. the corporates set up a farm service centre in 1999 on a 250-acre plot and helped wheat cultivators improve productivity. according to a senior hll official, the wheat production went up by 70 per cent and the quality of the grain could be improved because of expert advise. deshmukh, who was witness to the hll chief's presentation, is said to have immediately extended him an invitation for a slide presentation to the state cabinet. accordingly, prominent businessmen involved in the food industry, including nadir godrej from godrej industries, banga and nasser monjee from idfc, made a presentation to the cabinet ministers and top state officials. the government has decided to get into the act and constituted a task force under the chairmanship of agriculture minister rohidas patil to prepare a road map for the state's agro economy. other members of the task force include banga, suketu shah, godrej, monjee, raju dubey, pallavi jha and secretaries of the departments of agriculture, cooperation and industry.

11,ICICI bullish on lending to farm sector,"mumbai: while most financial institutions in the country are battling to contain the spiralling npa levels, icici has discovered that it pays to lend to farmers. the fi lent rs 600 crore to the farm sector without a single defaulter, an icici official told the times of india. and with many corporate houses on the default list icici is now planning to strengthen its focus on the agro sector. lending to the agro sector has its advantages, the loans are of short gestation period, usually lasting an average crop cycle of 4-6 months, and carry a market rate of interest, the official added. as part of its agro initiative icici has drawn up a three-fold approach, supporting the farmer, supporting corporate-backed farm-based initiatives and infrastructure projects for the food processing industry with linkages to the major fmcg groups. icici has also tied up with companies like hindustan lever, balarampur chini and eid parry to finance contract farming initiatives in andhra pradesh and karnataka. as part of this corporate houses contract farmers to grow seeds, cotton and sugarcane, while icici finances these initiatives. icici also finances infrastructure projects for the food processing industry. ""there was a party who wanted to set up a mango processing plant, but did not have any backward or forward integration, so we helped provide the backward integration with a farmers' cooperative and forward integration with pepsi and hll, and then financed his project,"" the icici official said. ""we have lent rs 600 crore to this sector and are now planning to lend to the dairy sector too,"" the official added. as part of its farmer initiative icici has tied up on one hand with companies like rallis, which provide seeds and technology to farmers, and where icici provides the finance. icici has also tied up with companies like hll and pepsi foods which source produce from the farmers directly. this way the middlemen is eliminated, and while the farmer gets the financial support he does not actually get any money in hand. the first such initiative was launched in madhya pradesh with 30 wheat farmers.
