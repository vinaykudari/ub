1,Jaya to slap Pota on Union minister,"CHENNAI: In the first action of its kind, the Tamil Nadu government decided on Monday to slap Pota against Union minister and MDMK treasurer M Kannappan for allegedly supporting the banned LTTE in public. CM J Jayalalithaa also urged PM Vajpayee to dismiss him from the Union ministry.

MDMK chief Vaiko has been in jail for more than a year for the same reason.

No law prevents a state government from arresting a Union minister in the public interest if he indulges in activity against the law, said Jayalalithaa in her four-page letter to Vajpayee.

The letter says if the PM will not act due to compelling political reasons, the state government will have no option but to take action, given the gravity of the situation.

She said Kannappan not only spoke in support of the LTTE on September 16 night at a book release function but also boasted of having done so 25 times earlier. Kannappan had also declared, says her letter, of being ready to give up his ministership rather than compromising on party principle.

3,Family feud leads to constable's suicide,"NEW DELHI: The spate of suicide by security personnel continued on Monday with a constable with the Secretariat Security Force (SSF) killing himself over an alleged disagreement in his family.

According to the police, Govind Vats (43) shot himself dead with his service revolver late on Sunday night at Kapashera in southwest Delhi. He was rushed to the Institute of Spinal Injuries by his son. Vats, however, died before he could be admitted to the hospital.

According to sources, the victim was upset over the fact that his daughter-in-law had gone to attend a wedding without his permission. A family member said that earlier too he had threatened to commit suicide over the same reason.

In another incident, a National Security Guard (NSG) commando committed suicide on Friday morning at the NSG camp in Kapashera in southwest Delhi. 26-year-old Dharmendra Rawat shot himself dead using his AK-47 rifle after a strife with his parents over the choice of girl for his marriage.

4,"Lathicharge decried, call for bandh on Tuesday","AHMEDABAD: Various political organisations and trade unions of the state lashed out at the government for having ordered the lathi charge on members of the MahaGujarat Navnirman Front on Sunday.

The front has given a call for bandh on Tuesday to all colleges in the state and has organised a meeting of various sections of the society such as teachers, farmers, students and members of the NGOs at the Town Hall here, a move which has the government on tenterhooks once again.

Meanwhile, members of the Gujarat State Federation of College and University Teachers'' Associations, as part of their agitation, made a bonfire of the ''anti-teacher notices'' issued by the state government to discourage teachers from agitating on Monday.

Members of CPI (M), Centre of Indian Trade Union, Democratic Youth Federation of India, LIC Employees'' Union, Students'' Federation of India, NSUI and Akhil Bhartiya Janwadi Mahila Sangh have lent their support to the front.

Condemning the police lathicharge on agitating teachers and other members of the front outside the Akash Ganga Maidan, CPI (M) leader, state secretary Arun Mehta, termed it as ''statesponsored terrorism"".

""The police resorted to lathicharge on several leaders and workers who were expressing their ire against the government in a peaceful and democratic manner. They also dragged people living in surrounding colonies out of their homes and hit them,"" Mehta said.

He has appealed to all those members of the society who believe in democratic values to fight the government tyranny and has demanded resignation of Modi for having failed to deliver on all fronts.

The Gujarat Pradesh Nationalist Congress Party and the All India Democratic Students'' Organisation too has flayed police action on teachers.

5,Both bouquets & brickbats for state industrial policy,"AHMEDABAD: The Confederation of Indian Industry''s Gujarat unit has welcomed the state government''s industrial policy which, it said, has tried to build on the strengths, recognise the weaknesses and has attempted to find solutions to them.

However, CII has also pointed out that in order to retain leadership position and to compete with other states and regions, the quality of delivery and strictness on compliance is of utmost importance.

The CII said it feels that a definite timeline needs to devised along with a proper redressal mechanism for the policy to be effective.

A CII press release claimed that the industrial policy includes various CII recommendations, including the Single Establishment Act.

The objective of Gujarat''s Industrial Policy â€” Global Competitiveness for Industries in Gujarat â€” is in line with CII Gujarat''s theme of the year, Competitiveness â€” Fast Forward to being No. 1.

The CII welcomed the forward-looking approach spelt out in the policy,which, it said, aims at transforming Gujarat into an industrial powerhouse in the global arena.

The GCCI said, ""The policy declared in the background of the ''Vibrant Gujarat'' initiative of the Government of Gujarat has inculcated necessary corrective steps in the earlier industrial policy declared by the state government in 2000.""

""Today, Gujarat stands third among all Indian states by attracting investment to the tune of Rs 1.38 lakh crore and ranks second in terms of value added by the manufacturing sector and availability of power. The policy will fulfil the vision of Gujarat as an Asian leader in industrial growth and a major player in global markets.""

The GCCI said that the Industrial Policy 2003 will help Gujarat to forge ahead economically, fuelled by the proactive and industryfriendly policy measures enumerated.

Looking ahead and beyond, the policy warrants a resolve to bring about rapid resurgence of Gujarat which was beset with catastrophic happenings in the recent past and show to the world that the state can overcome all odds.

The Paryavaran Suraksha Samiti, however, said, ""The Industrial Policy 2003 is trying to facilitate industries to legalise their present illegal activities related to labour and environment laws.""

It further said that the policy is not ready to recognise pollution-related problems in Gujarat.

Instead of worrying about increasing pollution levels, the government is planning to give a free hand to polluting industries in the name of self-certification.

The policy states that ""the government would develop new industrial estates based on the regional environmental impact assessment/carrying capacity study of the region to avoid any possible conflicts and litigations in future as also to ensure sustainable development"".

The samiti said, ""The statement clearly indicates that the government is more worried about the litigations against the polluting industries rather than environment.""

6,Modi's new tourism policy keeps Gujarat 'dry',"AHMEDABAD: In its third policy announcement in successive days, the Modi government on Monday announced a new tourism policy which clearly intends to keep Gujarat the only ''dry'' state in the country.

Brushing aside earlier speculations that there may be some relaxation in the prohibition rules, especially for outsiders who come to the state, tourism minister Anil Patel said ""prohibition is not a part of tourism policy"".

Patel said that the government would continue to issue provisional liquor permits to foreign tourists free of cost, while the tourists coming from other parts of India would have to pay Rs 225 for the permit.

""We have simplified the procedures for such permits to foreign tourists who would be given the required information at the special counters set up at airports within the state,"" he said.

Tourism Corporation of Gujarat Ltd (TCGL) managing director D K Rao, who was present at the news conference, said the foreigners, including NRIs coming from abroad, will get a special sticker on their passports at their entry points and they can avail liquor from the permit shops.

The privatisation of the assets of TCGL and incentives for tourism projects are the two major features of the policy aimed at giving a new boost to tourism, but is unlikely to enthuse the hospitality and travel industry in Gujarat which was looking for a partial lifting of prohibition.

Patel said the government has decided to create facilities of Five-Star hotels at important beaches, including Ahmedpur-Mandvi, Chorwad, Dumas, Tithal, Ubhrat and Mangrol, which do not have adequate facilities for tourists.

Referring to the ongoing process of privatisation of the property initiated by the TCGL, the minister said that some of the property would be handed over to private parties either on ownership basis or on lease for a stipulated period of time.

Special entertainment zones will be developed for fun, leisure and health. Rides, water parks, children''s park and theme restaurants offering Chinese and continental food have also been proposed.

For implementation of the policy, the services of Gujarat Industrial Promotion Board (GIPB) would be utilised,while commissioner of tourism will be the nodal officer for implementation.

Projects having investments less than Rs 50 crore will be approved at the government level, while those above this amount will be approved by the GIPB.

Necessary amendment to the GIPB Act will be carried out for this purpose.

Patel said that to meet increasing demand for trained personnel for entertainment industry, the government would encourage setting up of an Institute of Hotel Management, and Food Craft Institute by the private sector.

The government will provide land at concessional rates for these institutes.

For the first time, the government has plans to earmark certain areas in industrial estates of GIDC and special economic zones for tourism projects like hotels, resorts and other amenities.

The TCGL will set up a cell to attract NRI investment in tourism projects.

The state has sought the central government''s permit for three new tourist circuits, including one in North Gujarat covering Sidhpur, Patan, Balaram and Ambaji and other in Saurashtra covering Junagadh, Porbander, Dwarka and Palitana.

The policy envisages setting up of dinosaur fossil parks at Balasinor and in Kutch. Similarly, Lothal â€” known for its Harappan ruins â€” will also be developed as a tourist attraction spot.

7,Three PIs arrested by CID,"AHMEDABAD: The CID (Crime) on Sunday arrested three police inspectors, including one from its own ranks, for implicating transporters of Bhavnagar by furnishing false evidence.

The three had also allegedly tried to frame former state minister and senior Congress leader Shaktisinh Gohil in a criminal offence.

Pramod Kumar, IG (crime) told TNN: ""The PIs have been booked under section 195 of the IPC. They have been found guilty of being part of a conspiracy that had implicated innocent persons.""

Kumar was referring to the arrest of three transporters associated with Gujarat Travels based in Bhavnagar.

K R Jadeja PI with CID (crime), H R Jadeja and H M Patel who are PIs at Bhavnagar, were nabbed for the concocting a murder conspiracy leading to the arrest of the three transporters.

Investigators said a case of dacoity had been registered with the Vartej police station by A K Gohil at Bhavnagar in March 2003.

Gohil, a transporter, had alleged that robbers had looted valuables from his brother''s residence.

After this complaint was filed, Gohil allegedly met K R Jadeja, then a PSI in Bhavnagar, and sought his help to frame charges against his rival transporters associated with Gujarat Travels.

Police sources disclosed that in a pre-planned manner, a bus conductor based in Bhavnagar, Khuman Singh, was tutored by the PIs and Gohil to come up with false evidence against Gujarat Travels'' associates.

Singh was promised Rs 1 lakh for the task.

Based on Singh''s alleged statements and evidence proving that he had overheard Gohil''s rivals plotting to get him bumped off, the police then nabbed three persons from Gujarat Travels in May.

But after the job was done, Singh, according to his own confession, was not paid by his ""employers"".

Instead, he was allegedly illegally detained and beaten up by the PIs in order to pressurise him to falsely implicate the former minister in the plot.

Feeling threatened, Singh then approached the CID (crime) who investigated and cracked the case.

9,Amarmani's arrest spells trouble for wife,"LUCKNOW: The arrest of Amarmani Tripathi in the Madhumita murder case by the Central Bureau of Investigations (CBI) spells trouble for his wife Madhumani also. There are indications she too could be arrested any time now.

According to information, the witnesses are willing to part with valuable information in the high profile murder. On Monday, Amarmani was remanded in judicial custody for 14 days.

Sources in the CBI said that at least three key witnesses and two important co-accused are willing to turn CBI approvers. They have submitted written complaints that Amarmani was threatening them with dire consequences and hence did not provide the investigators details of the murder. They were being terrorised by Amarmani. Reports of the former minister having allegedly eliminated one of the assailants of Madhumita made these witnesses fearful and develop cold feet.

As the witnesses and the co-accused who were ready to turn approvers were seen to be withdrawing, it became necessary for the CBI to arrest Amarmani. Sources said that a high-level meeting of the CBI brasshats was held before the arrest. As of now, Amarmani was facing charges of tampering with the evidence related to the murder and not involved in the act himself. This will provide an easy passage for the CBI to procure remand of the mafia-turned-politician to question him about the motive behind tampering of evidence.

The arrest is sure to provide courage to the witnesses who earlier on believed that the high-profile former minister may escape the CBI dragnet leaving them to face his ire thereafter. But with a list of more than 20 clinching evidences of Amarmaniâ€™s involvement in the murder, there was little hope from him to walk out of the prison in the near future.

His arrest had begun to show positive results as barely an hour of the CBI laid its hand on Amarmani, Madhumitaâ€™s mother Shanti Devi took the first ever bold stand before the media seeking arrest of all others involved in the crime.

In a chain reaction, a onetime close business partner of Amarmani Manoj Goel too came up with fresh details about the involvement of the Tripathis in the killing. Adding to it was Deshraj. Under high security care of the CBI at the Yashwant Palace premises of CBIâ€™s SIC (IV) at Chanakyapuri, Deshraj had failed on the lie detector test twice. Now under the care of a psychologist, Deshraj was coming up with fresh facts shedding more light on Madhumita murder case. Sources said that there were possibilities that only one assailant had visited Madhumita and shot her and that Deshraj was misleading the investigators by narrating the â€œtwo assailantsâ€� theory out of fear of Amarmani Tripathi.

A CBI team would also visit Raju Pandey in Pilibhit jail to collect further details while another round of raids in Noida to collect details of another assialant alleged to have been eliminated by Amarmani at his Rudrapur farmhouse were yeilding results. â€œThere is little more left before Madhumani would be in CBI custody,â€� admitted a senior officer familiar with the investigations.

11,"Trio, 2 lawyers held for TDP workers' murder","MAHABUBNAGAR: Three persons accused in the murder of two TDP workers were arrested by the police on Sunday. Two advocates, who had promised to help the accused, were also held.

SP R K Meena said TDP activists Anjaneyulu and Tirumala Satyam were murdered on September 14, while they were pasting posters and banners in Jadcharla town as part of the â€˜Intintiki Telugu Desam'' programme.

TDP leaders levelled allegations against TRS leaders saying that they were behind the double murder. Police investigation revealed that the brother-in-law of Anjaneyulu, Srinivas Mudiraj, with the help of two friends and three hired killers, did away with Anjaneyulu and Satyam. Srinivas had hired the goons only to finish off Anjaneyulu, but as Satyan was a witness to the murder, the killers ended his life as well.

Srinivas married Anjaneyulu''s sister seven years ago against the wishes of Anjaneyulu, and was at loggerheads with him. Srinivas joined the TRS immediately after its launch. He tried to kill Anjaneyulu with country-made bombs last year, but failed. He engaged three hired killers â€” Haji, an accused in five murder cases, Sasidhar and Izaz accused in three murder cases each â€” for Rs 2 lakh to kill Anjaneyulu.

He also asked Chakri and Chanti, his friends, to help out. Advocates Thagur and Srinivas assured the gang that they would rescue them from the case after the murder.

Srinivas, his two friends and the two advocates have been arrested. The hired killers are yet to be caught. Police parties have been formed to nab them.

12,YSR's man killed in political feud,"KADAPA: Simhadripuram mandal parishad president K Ramalinga Reddy, 46, a Congress leader and an associate of Y S Rajasekhara Reddy, was killed by his rivals on Sunday night, near his house in Pulivendula of Kadapa district.

Congress Legislature Party leader Y S Rajasekhara Reddy represents Pulivendula constituency and Simhadripuram mandal falls under his constituency.

Ramalinga Reddy won the Kasanuru MPTC member post in the local body elections against TDP candidate K Ravindranath Reddy. He later became the mandal president of Simhadripuram. Ramalinga Reddy had a rivalry with TDP leader Purushotham Reddy of Y Kothapalli village of the same mandal for the last several years. Purushotham Reddy and Ravindranath Reddy are close associates in the TDP.

According to police records, Ramalinga Reddy made a vain bid to kill Purushotham Reddy on Sept. 21, 2001. Exactly two years later, Ramalinga Reddy was killed by his rivals.

Police said at least six unidentified persons attacked Ramalinga Reddy with hunting sickles and knives and killed him. Though he was shifted to hospital immediately, doctors declared him brought dead.

A bandh was observed in Pulivendula and Simhadripuram on Monday protesting the murder of the Congress leader. Kadapa MP Y S Vivekananda Reddy, ZP vice-chairman S Ravindranath Reddy, Pulivendula mandal president Gangi Reddy, Simhadripuram ZPTC member P G Sambasiva Reddy and many Congress leaders and activists attended the funeral.

13,Punjab employees spit thunder at rally,"CHANDIGARH: Punjab government employees under the banner Punjab Mulazam Sangharsh Committee have threatened to intensify their agitation and spread it to the entire state at a massive rally here on Monday to protest against the anti-employees policies of the government.

Adding a new dimension to their agitation, the employees has described the government move to transfer seven departments like elementary education, primary health, rural development to Panchayati Raj Institutions.

Also, the employees are opposed to privatising ITIs, Shahpur Kandi project, road transport, electricity board and corporations. What has hurt them the most are the negative changes in the commutation of pension and lowering the ceiling on their accumulated leave from ten to four months and the introduction of contributory pension schemes.

In a resolution adopted at the rally, the employees strongly criticised Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh for backing out of his commitments made to employeesâ€™ organisations on September 5 last year and for implementing the anti-employees policies. Also, the employees have criticised the Punjab government for not honouring its commitment of providing free and quality education, medial care, water supply, aid to weaker sections, the aged, widows and a massive hike in fee, failure to fill thousands of vacant posts.

On the other hand, the government has resorted to open loot by effecting a manifold increase in salaries and allowance of the ministers and legislators, appointment of large number of law officers and chairmen of the boards and corporations, they pointed out.

15,4 arrested for sodomy in Ghazibanda,"HYDERABAD: Four persons, who reportedly sodomised a 19-year-old youth on Thursday last, were arrested on Monday. They have been remanded to judicial custody.

16,It's 'kanduva' politics,"HYDERABAD: First day, first show. Political party leaders decided to change their sartorial styles a wee bit. Congress party MLAs, for instance, came without their regulation tri-colour kanduvas. Led by CLP leader Y S Rajasekhara Reddy, they entered the House without the otherwise must accoutrement.

BJP MLAs, led by their new floor leader K Hari Babu, came in with saffron kanduvas. Coming in late, city MLA Premsingh Rathod was going to be the odd one out, but a party activist came to his rescue and rushed to hand over the saffron accessory.

Photo finish: While photographers were busy framing TRS MLAs, TDP MLA Sanakkayala Aruna found herself in the TRS group. She hurriedly rushed aside, leaving TRS MLAs in peels of laughter.

Fast change in leadership: Congress MLAs from the delta region were not among those led by the CLP leader. Avanigadda MLA Mandali Buddha Prasad, who was on a hunger strike demanding release of water for delta region recently, spearheaded them into the House.

Warm breakfast meet: Chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu was all smiles at the breakfast hosted by speaker K Pratibha Bharathi at the Jubilee Hall. His handshake with the opposition leader was authoritative, presumably sending across a message that he is unshakeable even as both the leaders posed for photographers.

17,HC restrains police from arresting Roshans,"MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Monday restrained the police till September 25 from arresting film-maker Rakesh Roshan, his actor son, Hrithik, and father-inlaw, J. Omprakash, in six cases of alleged cheating.

Justices Ranjana Desai and P.V. Kakade heard the arguments of Jayantilal Gada of M/s Popular Entertainment Network, who has filed six cases against Rakesh Roshan, Hrithik and J. Omprakash for alleged cheating.

Gadaâ€™s counsel A.Y. Sakhare pleaded that the high court had no jurisdiction to hear this matter under article 226 of the Constitution.

The Roshans and J. Omprakash filed a rejoinder through their lawyer, Dipesh Mehta, saying that the division bench had the jurisdiction. With the consent of both sides, the matter was deferred to September 25.

Gada alleged that the Roshans and J. Omprakash had committed breach of agreements with regard to merchandising of films.

Earlier, the high court had suggested the parties go for an out-of-court settlement.

Accordingly, they met on August 6, but could not work out a compromise and decided to follow the legal course.

The Roshans had entered into agreements with M/s Popular Entertainment Network for merchandising their past and future films, including Kaho Na Pyar Hai.

J. Omprakash also entered into agreements with the same company for marketing films made by him. However, dispute arose over payments.

18,State govt to recover water dues,"GANDHINAGAR: Enough indications are available that the Gujarat government may go tough against local bodies -- municipal corporations, municipalities, panchayats -- for considering water a free good.

Government departments ""have just followed chief minister Narendra Modi''s instructions in putting up the huge Rs 102 crore bill on the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) as water dues for the Narmada waters being supplied to the Sabarmati river"", an official conceded. But, clearly, this is not the only due the AMC and other local bodies would have to pay.

Top Sachivalaya sources say, the total unpaid water dues against the local bodies come to a huge Rs 1,304 crore. This includes nearly Rs 800 crore to be paid as water charges to the Narmada Nigam, Rs 477 crore to the irrigation department, and Rs 37 crore to the water supply department. ""The Narmada Nigam has charged Rs 102 crore to the AMC for the 120 million cubic metres (MCM) supplied to Sabarmati. This was in response to the AMC''s frequent demands for water"", claimed an official.

Yet, the AMC is not the only body that has been forwarded a big bill. ""The Nigam has also asked for Rs 25 crore from the Vadodara Municipal Corporation, supplied nearly 40 MCM supplied for two years, yet another Rs 595 crore from the Gujarat Water Supply and Sewerage Board (GWSSB) for the supply of water from Narmada to Bhavnagar, Rajkot, Jamnagar and Kutch, and Rs 50 crore from local bodies for filling up hundreds of ponds"".

Though the issue is ticklish, senior officials say, unless the state government takes a tough line for recovering water dues, it would become impossible to economise the use of Narmada waters and irrigate 18 lakh hectares, as planned. ""If the AMC had desired, it could have put a pipeline at the mouth of the Narmada canal for getting Narmada waters. That would have reduced wastage. Even today, it is not too late"", argued an official.

Officials say, the AMC and other local bodies know that the Narmada Nigam charges at the rate Rs 6.40 per cubic metre of drinking water, nearly 10 times more than the irrigation and water supply departments. The latter two currently charge the rate of 73 paise per cubic metre whose upward revision is under active consideration. A draft water policy talks of the ""application of appropriate water tariffs"" for reducing water losses.

In fact, even at the old rate, say officials, the AMC has not paid a huge Rs 133 crore for the waters it received first from Dharoi, then from the Raska Wier and the Narmada canal. ""Unfortunately, since 1978, the AMC and most local bodies have been considering water as free"", said an official. Add to this Rs 87 crore dues against the municipal corporation of Bhavnagar, Rs 5.42 crore against Vadodara, Rs 0.63 crore against Surat, Rs 7.32 crore against Rajkot, Rs 20.57 crore against Jamanagar.

Officials say, an upward revision would alone lead to the conjective use of water. ""The Narmada dam at 138 metres on completion would store the same amount of water as Ukai in South Gujarat does. Yet, due to lack of planning, Ukai irrigates just 3.5 lakh hectares (ha), though 18 lakh ha is planned with the same quantity of waters in the Narmada dam. A higher water charge with periodic revision may ensure this. After the AMC was put the huge bill, the wastage has minimised"", claimed an official.

19,"Strife apparent between Kokje, state govt","SHIMLA: It may not exactly be a love-hate relationship between the government and the Raj Bhawan, but in the recent ordinance regarding amendments in the Himachal Pradesh University Act and the Bills concerning the hike in salaries of legislators and ministers, signed recently by governor V S Kokje, one could see a feeling of acrimony.

Though the chief minister has denied that there is any confrontation with the Raj Bhawan, and the governor told newspersons recently that he was not under any pressure from the government and that he would rather quit than work under pressure, but apparently if not a cold war, relations have to thaw between the two.

First, the Bills regarding the hike of salaries of the speaker, ministers and legislators. The Bills were kept pending by Kokje for almost two months and four ministers of the Virbhadra cabinet had to go to the governor to remind him that the Bills were pending and that either he return them to the government with his suggestions, or sign them.

Though Raj Bhawan sources said that the prolonged time was probably because Kokje may have forgotten about them, but the very fact that the governor expressed his resentment even when he signed them on Saturday last, on the plea that it was unfortunate that a state in a financial crises should put such a huge extra burden on the excehquer, was an indication that the delay was perhaps intended.

Then the ordinance regarding the amendments in the Himachal Pradesh University Act, which the governor signed on Monday, but only after it sent back to him by the cabinet. The governor had early returned the proposed ordinance with his suggestions, and the government revised the original draft, incorporating most of the constructive suggestions and returned it to him.

Kokje signed the ordinance on Monday, but has still recommended that when the Bill is brought to the Assembly two suggestions be incorporated, which the government had earlier refused to comply to in the revised draft. The suggestions are that the word ""suspended"" in case of the vice chancellor be diluted by ""long leave"" and the length of experience of IAS and HAS officers sent on deputation to the University.

However, education minister Asha Kumari said that the governor had shown his legal expertise in the quick manner in which he had promulgated the ordinance, so that the government could introduce a healthy environment conducive to academic work on the University campus.

She said that the fact that the governor had signed the ordinance as the revised draft was sent without any changes, was an indication that he had actually coopearted in investigations into matters of financial and administration irregularity on campus and the new Act would help curtail corruption and wasteful expenditure of government funds in the University.

20,NGO asks NHRC to probe farmers' suicides,"BANGALORE: The South India cell for human rights education and monitoring (SICHREM) has urged the National Human Rights Commission to set up a panel to investigate the increasing number of suicides by farmers in the state.

In an appeal to NHRC Chairman Justice A S Anand, SICHREM has stressed the need for a crisis-level response to stall the farmers'' suicides who have been increasingly resorting to taking their lives when faced with crop failure and mounting debts.

""Farmers'' suicides in Karnataka are ultimately to be seen as the violation of economic rights leading to the absolute violation of the very right to life,"" the cell said.

It pointed out that the government''s recent announcement of a farmers'' package was likely to fail since it was not based on a study of the real issues. ""In the past the government''s patchy piecemeal relief work such as food for work have failed to alleviate problems by farmers. It is even alleged that the produce meant for this programme reached the godowns of politicians rather than benefiting the farmer,"" it said.

SICHREM referred to the meeting chaired by Chief Minister S M Krishna to elicit views on how to tackle the problem, and while largely supporting the recommendations, urged NHRC to set up a panel for the following:

a) To conduct an inquiry into farmers'' suicides in Karnataka and the critical question of how the administration failed to anticipate such a crisis and counter it with efficient speed.

b) To act as an advisory body to the government on sustainable preventive measures.

c) To pressurise the government to act quickly in order to alleviate the sufferings of the farming community.

21,26 shops gutted in Kodinar violence,"RAJKOT: Communal violence raised its head once again, this time in the volatile Kodinar town of Junadadh district, where widespread arson was reported on Monday night.

The burning of a shop belonging to the local Bajrang Dal president Balubhai Jadhav on Sunday night in Kodinar lead to communal repercussions on Monday night where at least 26 shops owned by Muslims in the town were torched by mobs on Monday night. Police arrested fifty three persons and claimed the situation was under control but mobs resorted to slogan shouting even late in the evening on Tuesday outside the police station.

The mob was demanding the release of some VHP activists, mainly belonging to the influential Karadiya Rajput community, who were among those arrested for the arson incidents. The town had witnessed communal disturbances even during the Ganesh Mahotsav earlier this month.

Even though the police officials, who investigated the incident on Sunday night where the shop belonging to Jadhav was found burnt, stated that the fire was sparked of by an electric short circuit, the mobs, which took to the streets of Kodinar on Monday night were convinced that it was an act of sabotage. They went about burning shops in Chara Japa, Kodi Chora Chowk, Ekta Chowk, Bus Station and Fish Market areas, according to the police.

Fire fighting teams from Diu, Veraval, Una and Talala were rushed immediately to deal with the fires. Police inspector Dilipsinh Gohil said one tractor, one Indica Car, one sword, three knives, two motorcycles, one iron rod, pipes and sticks were seized from the rioters along with eight LPG gas cylinders and a can of kerosene which were stolen from a shop which was later burnt down.

22,I have done nothing wrong: MDMK minister,"COIMBATORE: A day after the Tamil Nadu government decided to slap Pota against Union minister and MDMK leader M Kannappan, the latter said he had not violated the oath of office or done anything against the sovereignty of the nation. â€˜â€˜I have been a total abider of law and done nothing wrong,â€™â€™ Kannappan told reporters here.

On whether he proposed to resign over the issue, the minister replied in negative, saying the Prime Minister had to take a decision on this. Accusing chief minister Jayalalithaa of â€˜â€˜crossing limits of her power and misusing Pota against political leadersâ€™â€™, Kannappan said the letter written to the PM was â€˜â€˜dictatorial, illegal and suppressiveâ€™â€™ in nature.

On whether a Union minister can be arrested, he said, â€˜â€˜As far as I know, no. But, anything can happen in Tamil Nadu, where there is no law or convention.â€™â€™ Reiterating that the MDMK had extended only moral support to the LTTE because it was fighting for the cause of Tamils, Kannappan said his party had not extended any support by way of weapons or funds. The MDMK will not support any anti-national movement, including the LTTE, he said, adding, â€˜â€˜Nobody has been instigated and there has been no violence anywhere because of my speech.â€™â€™

Citing incidents of VHP leader Praveen Togadia distributing tridents in Tiruchi in Tamil Nadu and â€˜â€˜inciting violenceâ€™â€™ against certain religious groups, Kannappan said the state was not bothered about taking any action. On a recent meeting between MDMK leaders and Deputy PM L K Advani, the minister said this had nothing to do with his issue.
