0,"BRP seeks disqualification of two ministers, MLA","MUMBAI: Bharatiya Republican Party (BRP) leader Prakash Ambedkar has moved against two of his party ministers and one MLA for issuing warning to the Congress high command against replacing chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh.

The BRP has written to the speaker of the state legislative assembly, Arun Gujarathi, asking him to initiate action under anti-defection Act against the two ministers, Dasharath Bhande and Ramdas Bodkhe, and MLA Vasant Suryavanshi.

The BRP has only these three MLAs in the 288-member state legislative assembly. The party leadership is upset with them for issuing a statement supporting the chief minister and warning the Congress high command against his replacement.

All the three have signed the statement issued by the independent ministers and MLAs supporting Mr Deshmukh.

Mr Ambedkar has taken a stand that his party has supported the Democratic Front government and has electoral understanding with the Congress. Whether Mr Deshmukh should continue as a chief minister or he should be replaced is an internal matter of the Congress and the BRP ministers and MLA had no business to participate in the power play within the ruling Congress, according to Mr Ambedkar.

The state legislature secretariat has confirmed the letter from the BRP asking for action against the three BRP legislators. The BRP had first given a show-cause notice to the three legislators asking them why action should not be taken against them under the anti-defection Act for issuing a statement against the partyâ€™s official line without consulting the party officials.

After receiving replies from all the three legislators, the party officials said they were not convinced and took the step of seeking action of disqualification of these MLAs under the provisions of the anti-defection Act. Since there is no immediate state legislature session, the speaker is likely to take some time before finally disposing the complaint from the BRP.

Cold war has been brewing for quite some time between Mr Ambedkar, grandson of late Babasaheb Ambedkar and Mr Deshmukh. Mr Ambedkar was upset with Mr Deshmukh ever since he tried to win over BRP MLAs to his side.

Mr Ambedkar has expressed serious reservations on Mr Deshmukhâ€™s moves to secure his chief ministership by undermining the authority of smaller parties. According to informed sources, Mr Ambedkar even complained to senior Congress leaders against such moves, which claimed would ultimately undermine the Congress high commandâ€™s position.

The speaker is expected to take decision on the BRP application before the winter session of the state legislature, beginning in Nagpur December. Ambedkar

1,Campaigning ends for 2nd phase of J&K polls,"JAMMU: Campaigning in the 13 constituencies of Jammu district ended on Sunday, with no one to predict with any degree of certainty what the fate of the â€˜â€˜main contestantsâ€™â€™ would be in multi-cornered fight.

Predictably, the Congress and the BJP fielded a galaxy of star campaigners in the district which has the largest number of seats as well as voters.

Jammu, Srinagar and Budgam districts go to polls in the second phase on Tuesday.

The major parties in the field are the National Conference, the BJP, the Congress and the BSP.

A new factor is the RSS-sponsored Jammu State Morcha which is likely to influence results in at least three of the seats. Ironically, the Morcha looks set to cut into the vote of the BJP with which it ostensibly has a â€˜â€˜poll allianceâ€™â€™. The alliance collapsed in three prestigious Jammu city constituencies, with nearly four lakh voters, when rival candidates were fielded. However, in Jammu West, the BJP candidate later retired.

The well-organised RSS cadre, who earlier worked for the BJP candidates, are now working only for the Morcha.

Such internal disunity is evident in the Congress as well. The bitterness between PCC chief Ghulam Nabi Azad and state Congress war horse Mangat Ram Sharma, generated at the time of the seat-allocation, is likely to affect the party fortunes.

2,No politics in MTNL appointments: Mahajan,"NEW DELHI: The controversy over the appointment of BJP members as part-time directors on the MTNL board will not dampen the performance of the state-owned telecom service providerâ€™s scrip on the New York Stock Exchange, as the choices were made to â€˜â€˜represent consumer interestsâ€™â€™, communications minister Pramod Mahajan said on Sunday.

â€˜â€˜Why should the appointments send any wrong signal? In the governmentâ€™s view, the appointees are competent and they are only part-time directors.

The government has not given operational control by making them the managing director or the chairman,â€™â€™ Mahajan told TNN. The minister said the political leaning or background of a person could not be a disqualification.

Mahajan recently appointed BJP Yuva Morcha leader and former Delhi University Studentsâ€™ Union president Monika, former head of the BJP economic cell Jagdish Shettigar, former Shiv Sena MP Adhik Shirodkar and BJPâ€™s Mumbai north-east district chief Ashwin Somnath Vyas as ex-officio directors on the MTNL board.

Mahajan, however, denied the involvement of any political favouritism. â€˜â€˜They do not have any criminal backgrounds, have a good social standing, and are well known in their fields. Also, they have not done anything to prove that they are incompetent,â€™â€™ Mahajan said.

He claimed that Monika had been inducted as â€˜â€˜consumerâ€™â€™ and not because of her BJP affiliations.

3,Vaghela blames govt for Vadodara riots,"AHMEDABAD: A day after Vadodara police commissioner DD Tuteja''s statement blaming Dubai-based don Abu Salem''s arrest for the outbreak of riots, Gujarat Congress chief Shankersinh Vaghela reacted by saying, ""The Gujarat government is only hiding its failure by saying this.""

Terming the breakdown of the law and order machinery at Vadodara as callousness of the home department, he pointed out that if Abu Salem''s arrest led to riots in Vadodara, then ""what does the chief minister have to say about the outbreak of riots in other places?""

""The truth is that very often the CM speaks lies,"" Vaghela said. Reacting to Chief Minister Narendra Modi''s statements against Congress president Sonia Gandhi, he said, ""You do not earn a reputation like Sita by scheming like Kaikeyi."" He added that the CM needs to wake up to the developments in the state.

5,'LIC plans to increase growth rate to 25% by 2005',"COIMBATORE: The Life Insurance Corporation had set itself a target of improving its growth rate to 25 per cent by 2005, from the current 20 per cent, LIC Chairman, SB Mathur said on Sunday.

In an informal chat with reporters here, he said the life insurance sector had witnessed an overall growth of 20 per cent during the past decade. The Corporation, through its new product portfolio, planned to increase its growth rate to 25 per cent by 2005.

LIC had registered 37 per cent growth rate in new premiums in the current fiscal, he said.

With an outstanding claim ratio of only .67 per cent, ''the best in the entire world'', LIC had an asset base of Rs 2.30 lakh crore, with Rs 73,000 crore income, Mathur said.

LIC proposed to interconnect all its 2,048 branches by March 2003, he said, adding that work had already been completed in 1350 branches, while work for interconnecting 200 to 250 branches would be completed in a phased manner owing to technical snags.

Later, inaugurating the ''Life Underwriters Guild of India,'' formed by insurance agents and development officers, he said such an association was necessary, in view of the competition and also to give efficient advise to customers to choose the right products.

The LIC was also conscious about the changing environment in the sector and was prepared to take on any competition, he added.

7,IFCI seeks govt help to restructure liabilities,"NEW DELHI: Despite posting a higher Rs 884.70 crore net loss in the last fiscal, IFCI on Monday said it can turn around by the next fiscal if the government infuses additional funds and assists the FI to restructure liabilities worth over Rs 12,500 crore.

""There is a possibility of recompensating the losses and the FI can turn around by next fiscal if the liabilities are restructured,"" IFCI chairman V P Singh said after the company''s ninth Annual General Meeting here.

IFCI increased its losses to Rs 884.70 crore last fiscal from Rs 261.93 crore in 2000-01, mainly due to decline in interest income and higher provisioning for non-performing assets, now at over 22 per cent.

Although it was reported that IFCI has sought Rs 8,000 crore financial assistance from government, Singh declined to divulge details of the package.

""We have asked government to assist us in restructuring our liabilities worth over Rs 12,500 crore through reduction in coupon rates and increasing the repayment period of its bonds,"" he said.

IFCI has to pay 16-17.5 per cent interest on its bonds subscribed by banks and FIs amounting to Rs 7,000 crore, provident funds (Rs 5,500 crore) and retail investors (Rs 1,300 crore).

The FI also sought extension of the repayment period of these bonds to 7-10 years, Singh said.

If the liabilities are restructured, the average cost of funds would come down to 9.0 per cent from the current 12.1 per cent, he said.

8,Power minister blasts govt for scrapping tariff hike,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Launching a strong attack against his own Chief Minister, Power minister Kadavur Sivadasan on Monday lambasted the government for rolling back the power tariff hike announced recently following popular backlash.

The minister wrote in a leading Malayalam daily that the recent hike was a decision of the cabinet, taken after experts said the immediate need was to pass on to the consumer the additional expense of Rs 84 crore incurred for buying thermal power following a weak monsoon and the consequent cut in hydel power production.

Sivadasan, who was admitted to an ayurveda hospital when the Chief Minister announced the scrapping of the proposed steep hike following popular protests, wondered if the government would do the same when petrol prices are hiked, bus fares are revised or prices of essential goods go spiralling up. Why then was the ""popular barometer"" applied only to power tariff hike? he asked.

Sivadasan, considered a Karunakaran camp adherent, said if the tariff is not increased, both the government and the Kerala Electricity Board will ""sink together"".

Blasting the previous Left Front government for saddling the Board with a dead investment of Rs 1,000 crore, the minister expressed amazement at the `gumption'' of CPM, which had `looted the Board with unparalleled avarice'', to agitate now.

""If I fire arrows at the crowd that has ruled the state and made a mess of the power board, it will hit A.K. Antony, K. Karunakaran, CPM''s E.K. Nayanar et al"". No one including himself, in his opinion, will escape unhurt.

The minister said the Antony government had in fact been considerate to limit the power hike to 25 per cent as against the experts'' suggestion of 90 per cent. ""The reformation of the Board should follow the hike, not precede it,"" he argued. The minister has not, however, touched a sensitive issue: The High Level Reforms Committee had recommended that the salary and perks of Board staff be frozen as they are drawing a very high salary compared to other government employees.

9,BKU protesters block traffic,"KHANNA: The traffic was blocked for several hours on GT Road near Malerkotla Chowk by the workers of Bharti Kisan Union to protest the non-announcement of minimum support price (MSP) for paddy by the Centre.

Earlier, BKU workers organised a protest rally in Asiaâ€™s biggest grain market here under the leadership of Bhupinder Singh Mann and Balbir Singh Rajewal, president and general secretary of the union, respectively.

Addressing the farmers, the union leaders said that the Central government had â€œpoliticised the issue of the MSPâ€�.

They said that the produce was lying in mandis but due to the non-announcement of the MSP and policy of purchase, the farmers were being forced to sell their paddy at a â€œlowerâ€� price.

The dharna continued for more than two hours.

10,Successful polls a victory over proxy war: Advani,"NEW DELHI: The successful conduct of elections in Jammu and Kashmir will enable India score a victory over Pakistan-sponsored proxy war, Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani said here on Monday. â€˜â€˜We are looking forward to these election which is changing the situation in the state. We will win the on-going proxy war through the successful conduct of these elections as we did in all the overt wars (against Pakistan) earlier,â€™â€™ Advani said after releasing a book on terrorism written by civil servant Bhure Lal. Castigating the Pervez Musharraf regime for criticising the J&K polls, he said: â€˜â€˜What kind of a ruler is he who mocks these elections? The day Atal Bihari Vajpayee took over as Prime Minister, Musharraf ousted an elected premier. And now two former prime ministers are not allowed to contest the polls in Pakistan,â€™â€™ Advani said. He recalled that during his recent trip to the UK, he was asked about the likely poll percentage in the J&K elections. To this, he had replied, â€˜â€˜I cannot guarantee 90 per cent polling (in the J&K elections) which Musharraf can.â€™â€™ The Deputy Prime Minister then added that the â€˜â€˜first round of polling in J&K has been decentâ€™â€™.

11,J&K polls: All but normal,"SRINAGAR: The Jammu and Kashmir assembly elections are poised to become a benchmark event that cannot but have an impact on the Kashmir situation. What is most striking is how â€˜â€˜normalâ€™â€™ it seems, with all the customary enthusiasm of voters and candidates. The awareness that the elections are really free and fair has begun to sink in, generating a wave against the ruling National Conference (NC). But coming on the eve of the second phase of the elections, it is probably too late. At the same time, a quick tour of the city and its environs makes it clear that things are, after all, not all that normal. Tuesdayâ€™s poll may repeat phase oneâ€™s dichotomous nature with some areas returning spectacular polling, but it will also show areas with an abysmally low turnout. The two-faced reality stares you in the face here. There are areas with no buntings or posters, leave alone signs of electioneering â€” Batmaloo, Bohri Kadal, Khanyar, Maisuma â€” to name a few, but there are adjoining areas like Ganderbal and Kangan, where polling will be heavy. The boycott campaign never really took off. The militant attacks have been isolated and the only major attack they planned at the Bemina police colony failed. â€˜â€˜Voters vote wherever they want to,â€™â€™ said a senior state administration official, â€˜â€˜they donâ€™t appear to be scared by the militants, leave alone the security forces.â€™â€™ Officials talk of villagers in the Surankote and Mendhar areas who broke queues and took cover when militants fired, but once the firing stopped, they rejoined the queue to cast their vote. The robust outcome of the first round of polling has encouraged those who were inclined to vote any way, but is not likely to change the minds of those who are determined not to vote. But if the no-sayers are determined to boycott the polls, there is no dearth of contestants. The two major national parties â€” the BJP and the Congress â€” and the regional majors, the NC and the Peopleâ€™s Democratic Parties have put up candidates for the 15 assembly seats of the Valley that will go to the polls on Tuesday. But the real story is in the participation of scores of candidates from what the Election Commission blandly calls â€˜â€˜unrecognised registered partiesâ€™â€™ â€” Janata Dal(U), Shakti Dal, the Jammu State Morcha, the Pantherâ€™s Party and so on. People are clearly willing to risk their lives for the great Indian lottery. Politics, it is well understood in Kashmir as well, is a route to upward mobility in life. Many leaders, including some separatists, are wondering whether or not they should have crafted their electoral strategy better. According to a senior Opposition leader who would not like to be named, â€˜â€˜With hindsight, I can say that we could have formed better pre-poll alliances and not just dented the NC, but defeated it.â€™â€™ On Monday, Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad made a plaintive appeal to smaller parties to opt out and let his party take on the NC directly.

12,"SAD, Cong, BJP appeal to govt over paddy price","CHANDIGARH: Farmers in Punjab have suddenly found so many messiahs that they canâ€™t seem to thank their luck enough.

All the three major political parties â€” the Cong ress , the Shiromani Akali Dal and the BJP â€” lobbied for them together on Monday pleading one by one to three Union ministers for their cause at a time when paddy had started glutting the state mandis.

In a curious coincidence, leaders of all the three parties virtually made a beeline to the offices of deputy prime minister L K Advani, agriculture minister Ajit Singh and consumer affairs, food and public distribution minister Sharad Yadav putting up almost an identical charter of demands for the state farmers.

While all of them could extract just reassuring words from the Union ministers, it must have bewildered the Centre to find all of them suddenly waking up to plead farmersâ€™ cause to them (Union ministers) on the same day.

They all wanted the Centre to start paddy procurement immediately as the markets had started glutting with paddy.

They were unanimous in their demand that the Minimum Support Price (MSP) for paddy be jacked up substantially to make for the losses suffered by farmers due to drought conditions and that specifications be relaxed in view of inclement weather conditions.

If tomorrow the Centre accedes to these demands, it would surely spark a battle of one-upmanship among the three parties to claim the credit.

SAD president Parkash Singh Badal stole the show by taking the lead over other two party leaders and was the first one to begin the exercise.

A delegation led by chief minister Amarinder Singh demanded that the Centre immediately announce the MSP for paddy for the year 2002-2003 and provide Rs 100 per quintal as bonus beyond the MSP to compensate farmers in the drought-affected state.

The chief minister later told mediapersons that if the Centre failed to come out immediately with the MSP the state government would be left with no option but to follow an agitational course.

â€˜â€˜We have met agriculture and food minister. Now we are seeking a meeting with finance minister on the matter. But if we failed to get support from the Centre on the issue, we have no option left but to go on a dharna hereâ€™â€™, Singh said.

The delegation comprised AICC general secretary Ambika Soni, deputy chief minister Rajinder Kaur Bhattal, PPCC president Hanspal and several Punjab ministers.

The chief minister said that all the leaders assured the delegation that the matter will be given a serious thought.

The state was now awaiting response from the Centre.

The chief minister said the state government had also sought financial assistance of Rs 6,000 crore on account of the loss due to drought conditions in the state.

SAD president Parkash Singh Badal, besides asking for Rs 750 per quintal MSP, demanded that co-operativesâ€™ loan recovery from farmers be deferred indefinitely and interest thereof be waived.

He wanted procurement to start immediately in the state. BJP president B L Rinwa led another delegation highlighting the difficult conditions farmers were facing in the state. The party suggested immediate relief measures be taken for them and paddy procurement be started immediately.

13,SC slaps fine on Himachal govt for ads on rocks,"NEW DELHI: In a clear message that it would not tolerate â€˜â€˜vandalismâ€™â€™ on ecology, the Supreme Court on Monday set up a corpus fund and asked the Himachal Pradesh government to deposit an exemplary Rs 1 crore.

The two cola giants, a publisher and a cement manufacturer, who had painted advertisements on rocks on the Manali-Rohtang road in the Himalayas is to pay a total of Rs 4 crore.

The fund is to be utilised for restoring the rock faces.

â€˜â€˜It is unfortunate that such large scale vandalism has been taking place with any check by the state governments,â€™â€™ a Bench, comprising Chief Justice B N Kirpal, Justice K G Balakrishnan and Justice Arijit Pasayat, said while issuing notice to the Karnataka government for allowing similar advertisements in the state.

The Bench also asked the Union environment and forest ministry to file an affidavit within three days detailing similar vandalism, if any, detected in other states.

Referring to the repeated orders of the court to safeguard the forests, the Bench said: â€˜â€˜It seems that with regard to the environment, all the thinking has to be done by the Supreme Court.â€™â€™

It said that after Himachal Pradesh, â€˜â€˜Karnataka is next on the lineâ€™â€™ as large scale painting of rock faces have been reported from the area around Bangalore.

Fixing September 26 for further hearing initially raised by solicitor-general Harish N Salve about the vandalism in Himachal, the Bench said: â€˜â€˜It is the duty of the state government to protect the environment and for dereliction of this duty, Rs 1 crore will be deposited by the state to meet the expenses for restoration of ecology.â€™â€™

The court took a serious view of the number of advertisements painted by MBD books (78), Coca-Cola (44), Pepsi (8) and Birla White (10) on the rock faces on both sides of the road from Rohtang to Manali.

As for Karnataka, the court also issued notices to ACC, Koramandal King, Rasna, Fertiliser and Chemical Travancore, Alpine and Indotech.

The court also asked Salve to work out the liabilities of Coca Cola, Pepsi, MBD Books and Birla White for setting up of the corpus. The court accepted the Central empowered committeeâ€™s report on this issue and asked Salve to inform it by September 26 regarding the money to be deposited by the other companies.

15,"‘It was a good party, but is already forgotten’","NEW DELHI: They got together to catch up with old times but when the news of the accident trickled in, it touched a raw chord. Although few old Sanawarians knew Gagandeep Bagga and Aman Bhalla, recent graduates, the news changed the mood.

â€˜â€˜It was a good party, but it has been forgotten,â€™â€™ said Rajveer Singh Gulia, a 1973 alumni and president of the Old Sanawarian Society. The society organises old studentsâ€™ get-togethers twice a year, in February and September. Usually, 160 to 170 people turn up.

Initially, it confusion reigned. â€˜â€˜The participation is not confirmed. We just post the intimation over the Internet and whoever wants to attend joins in,â€™â€™ Gulia said.

The news was difficult to confirm, added Neeraj Kapoor, another old Sanawarian. Nevertheless a doctor couple, also old Sanawarians, went in search of the accident victims. They could not locate anyone.

But they are thankful that other two friends survived. One of the two survivors, Arjun Mehta, was seated on the front co-passenger seat. â€˜â€˜I was in touch with Aman Bhalla even though he had left school after completing his Class 9. Gagandeep had joined the school in Class 11,â€™â€™ Mehta said.

His strong ties with both continued when the friends joined Rai Foundation in Delhi. Mehta used to meet them every week. â€˜â€˜I am pursuing my higher studies at the Institute of Technology and Management, Gurgaon.

We ensured that we met at least once a week,â€™â€™ he said. This was the first reunion which the old Sanawarians were going to attend after they left school this year.
