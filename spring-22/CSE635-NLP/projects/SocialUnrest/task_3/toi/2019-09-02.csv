0,"J&K polls, more than a ray of hope","NEW DELHI: In democracies, elections have a way of â€˜â€˜fixingâ€™â€™ the mood of the people. Though the actual poll is weeks away, a â€˜freeze frameâ€™ of the political mood reveals an unmistakable yearning for the hurly-burly of elections.

Coming as it does in a state that averages several violent deaths a day, it is as much a tribute to the temptations of democracy as to the efforts of those who have been trying to bring things to this pass.

However, neither have separatist sentiments become negligible nor has the threat of the gun receded. In fact, infiltration is up, signalling a possibly violent riposte on the part of the jihadis and their Pakistani controllers.

But, election fever can unleash its own dynamics and there is this chance that the state may become rational and less violent in future.

Clearly, the Election Commissionâ€™s efforts to prevent rigging has yielded results. Wannabe politicians sense a historic opportunity to break out of the National Conference-militant grid. This is the essence of the Peopleâ€™s Conference revolt against Hurriyat.

In Jammu and even in Kashmir, the Congressâ€™ strong showing has rattled the BJP enough to get them to close ranks with their NC allies. In Srinagar, the heart of the separatist rebellion, the ambivalence towards elections is still evident, but there is little support for the gunmen or Hurriyat hardliners like its chairman Abdul Ghani Bhat or its jailed eminence grise, Syed Ali Shah Geelani.

Violence may dampen this ardour, but it cannot erase the image of a peopleâ€™s irrepressible desire for â€˜normalâ€™ politics. Caught in this current, the leaders of the separatist movement are trying to stay afloat. Pro-Pakistan leaders like Geelani, Bhat and Maulvi Abbas Ansari oppose polls but have not called for a formal boycott.

Moderates like Mirwaiz Omar Farooq and Shabbir Shah want a dialogue to precede elections. They fear that post-elections, New Delhi might forget about the political dimension of the problem.

As the electoral process has begun there is little chance that the moderates can be accommodated by postponing polls. Anyway, Shah and the Mirwaiz were unlikely to come out openly in favour of polls after Abdul Ghani Loneâ€™s assassination.

The change in the Valley did not come up overnight, but is the result of a three-year effort by the Vajpayee government and its American allies to find a way out of the quagmire.

The response to the Jethmalani committee indicates that the time is ripe for a settlement. The end of the current election process should be seen as the beginning of another effort towards a political settlement of the dispute.

1,Controversies follow 'old' BCA polls,"RANCHI: Allotment of the money spinning one-day international (ODI) cricket match between the West Indies and India, during the forthcoming Windies tour of India, to Jamshedpur has put a question mark over the functioning of the cricket administrators in both Jharkhand and Bihar, particularly those who are stationed in Jamshedpur.

""No wonder cricket in this region continues to lag behind, so much so that a joint team of Jharkhand and Bihar is still not among the top three teams in the East Zone,"" commented a former Bihar cricket player and administrator.

The erstwhile Bihar Cricket Association, established in 1935, was dissolved in January 2001. This led to a conflict between the district units of Jharkhand and Jamshedpur-based individual members, with the districts demanding a fair deal in a fresh state association.

While the districts formed Jharkhand Cricket Association (JCA) and conducted tournaments, the Jamshedpur lobby formed Cricket Association of Jharkhand (CAJ), supported by the erstwhile BCA (1935), a senior district cricket functionary informed.

The BCA (1935) then conducted elections at Jamshedpur itself for both: Its progeny CAJ and the BCA (Patna). Thereafter, all kinds of pressure tactics were used against the districts to gain legitimacy for CAJ, but the majority of districts boycotted the CAJ elections. Finally the CAJ nominated the Jamshedpur SP Amitabh Choudhary as its president.

In the face of conflicts between CAJ and the districts on one hand and the CAJ and the BCA (Patna) on the other, pending affiliation to either CAJ or the BCA (Patna), the BCCI formed a committee to supervise cricket in both Jharkhand and Bihar for 2001-2002 season.

After a lot of acrimony the CAJ agreed to give the districts 15 votes each, and matching reservation in the committee of management so that the stranglehold of Jamshedpur-based individual members was equalised if not bettered by the districts, the functionary informed.

Recently, in another subtle move the nominated CAJ president Amitabh Choudhary was replaced by TISCO managing director S Muthuraman, he alleged.Cricket politicking has descended to its lowest level with the decision to hold the BCA (1935) elections on September 8.

The nominated CAJ president Amitabh Choudhary, who had lost the election for the BCA president''s post to Tata''s Sanjay Singh in 1999, is once again in the fray for the same post.

This time challenging him is another IPS, RR Verma, IG police. Also in the fray are some key office bearers of both the CAJ and the BCA (Patna), according to reports reaching here.

And the districts which had boycotted the CAJ elections in May 2001 have boycotted the coming BCA (1935) elections too, the district functionary confirmed.

Finally, the BCA (1935) elections beg a few questions: a) Why hold elections of a body (BCA-1935) that was dissolved in January 2001 and two separate state bodies were created in its place? b) Will the BCA (1935) elections supersede the BCCI''s committee for supervising cricket in Jharkhand and Bihar till affiliation is granted to Jharkhand and Bihar bodies?

2,Agriculture minister compares Rabri with Razia Sultan,"PATNA: Chief Minister Rabri Devi is getting used to being compared to royalty. At a public function organised on Saturday, a speaker compared her with Queen Elizabeth, who happens to be the constitutional head of her country.

Her own party MLAs, like Pappu Khan and Shyam Razak, publicly call her Rajmata (Queen Mother) Rabri Devi. It is another matter that her husband Laloo Yadav swears by fighting feudal forces.

While the competition to compare Rabri with royalty is understandable among ruling party leaders, it is surprising that even Union ministers do not lag behind, notwithstanding her unpleasant air trip from Delhi to Patna with two Union ministers recently.

Union minister of state for agriculture Hukumdeo Narayan Yadav, in a recent letter to Rabri, compared her with the legendary woman ruler of Indian history, Razia Sultan.

â€œEven Razia Sultan was not a highly educated woman. But, in history, she is considered an able administrator,â€� Yadav stated in a letter written to her, perhaps in desperation to ensure some relief to the flood-hit people of his village.

The contents of the letter of the Union minister make it amply clear that the Rabriâ€™s writ hardly runs in her own state. â€œI have grown tired of writing letters to the irrigation minister and the road construction minister. Nobody cares,â€� he wrote in the letter, suggesting the formation of a high-level technical committee to look into the perpetual problem of flood.

â€œI have written over one dozen letters to the irrigation minister and talked to engineers on phone over the condition of my village. But my villagers became paupers because water could not be drained out,â€� Hukumdeo has informed Rabri. The Union minister, in his letter, preaches about administration to the lady he has compared with Razia Sultan.

The Union ministerâ€™s remarks for officials and technical experts of the Rabri raj is telling enough. â€œThose whom we consider intelligent, wise, clever, able and technical are the same people who are behind ruining Bihar,â€� he has remarked, holding officials and technical experts responsible for the plight of the state due to floods and drought, and charged them with working on communal and caste lines.

Incidentally, the CM sent an acknowledgement letter to the Union minister and directed the development commissioner to look into the plea of the Union minister.

BJP circles in Bihar are tickled over Hukumdeo Narayan Yadavâ€™s letter to â€˜her majestyâ€™ Rabri Devi. â€œHe may have compared her with Razia Sultan, but he has also made it clear that her rule hardly runs in the state,â€� remarked a senior BJP leader.

3,Tiwari rules out rejoining Samata,"PATNA: Excise Minister Shivanand Tiwari has stressed that his statements at the public function held to inaugurate Ramanand Tiwari Halt on Saturday should not be seen as a move to rejoin the Samata.

At a public function of the railways, in which railway minister Nitish Kumar was present, Tiwari had stated that he had not become a minister due to the mercy of RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav, nor had he become an MLA due to Laloo. â€œThe statements made by me were due to pain and anger,â€� Tiwari said in a press note issued on Sunday.

Tiwari stressed that he had joined Laloo, leaving Nitish, not to return back to the Samata Party. â€œIt will be another matter if Lalooji expels me from his party,â€� Tiwari said, recalling that on joining the RJD, he had stressed that he would be with Laloo with all his ability and strength.

â€œBut I have a habit to call a spade a spade, which I will not give up. I had told him (Laloo) that the day you find my habit has become unpleasant for you, just tell me, and I will say tata-bye-bye,â€� Tiwari said.

He said that those opposing Ramanand Tiwari Halt had moved the court in favour of their own halt, but the court had turned down their plea. Instead, it upheld the construction of Ramanand Tiwari Halt.

â€œThe Bhojpur administration was warned that the inauguration would be opposed. â€œI could not control my emotions. An upper caste man in backward caste politics, I have suffered all sorts of insults and have tolerated it for a long time. People were being divided along upper and backward castes on the occasion. A halt was being inaugurated in the memory of a great man. What they were doing along the caste lines became intolerable for me,â€� he said.

Tiwari said he had thanked Nitish for the halt in the same way as he had thanked Laloo for installing a statue in the name of Ramanand Tiwari in Patna. â€œI am pained to see the state of backward politics in the country,â€� Tiwari said, calling himself a Lohiaite.

He recalled that in 1970, he had filed a case against Shankaracharya for advocating untouchability against Dalits. â€œI had received hundreds of letters full of abuses at that time. Some of them asked me to change my name from Shivanand to Suleman. Ram Vilas Bhai had appeared as a witness in my case,â€� Tiwari said.

After the implementation of the Mandal Commission recommendations, there was an unprecedented upsurge in the consciousness of the backward castes, he said, insisting that he had honestly followed Laloo and Nitish in pursuing backward caste politics. â€œBut what has happened is before everyone.â€�

4,YSR flays 7 years of Naidu's rule,"HYDERABAD: In a bitterly-worded tirade against the seven year â€œdark ruleâ€� of Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu, the Congress party alleged that Naidu had turned the state into Runandhra (debt ridden Andhra) instead of â€˜Swarnandhraâ€™ and called upon the people not to just express resentment but to agitate against the Telugu Desam Partyâ€™s (TDPâ€™s) misrule.

Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader Dr Y S Rajasekhara Reddy, in a nine page statement released on Sunday, said the seven year regime of Naidu was full of corruption, spiralling prices, suicides by farmers and lack of employment opportunities for youth.

He charged the chief minister of failing in all aspects of development. Naidu had cast Chandrajalam (magic of Chandra) to cover his â€œdark ruleâ€�, Reddy said.

Pointing out that the state was a surplus state of Rs 239 crore in 1993-94, Reddy criticised Naidu for blaming Congress party for the bad fiscal position now.

The Congress Legislature Party Leader accused Naidu of pushing the profit making public sector undertakings (PSUs) like the AP State Road Transport Corporation (APSRTC) and AP State Electricity Board (APSEB) into huge losses.

The corrupt practices of the chief minister started with the Hotel Viceroy episode seven years back and had been reflecting in all the programmes he had launched, including the implementation of Food-for-Work (FFW) programme, the Congress Legislature Party Leader said.

Reddy alleged that Naidu spent around Rs 2,555 crore for his personal publicity through the media. It the government had utilised the same money for pending minor irrigation projects, the state would not have faced drought conditions, he added.

The Congress Legislature Party Leader further said that the tax burden on people before 1995-96 was Rs 4,120 crore, but it had touched Rs 17,194 crore in 2002-03, an increase of Rs 13,074 crore in a span of seven years. Reddy alleged that the prices of essential commodities spiralled from 25 per cent to 400 per cent.

The Telugu Desam government failed in every aspect of governance. Power charges are up from 100 to 300 per cent, the debt of state had gone up from Rs 11,675 crore in 1994-95 to Rs 50,000 crore now, the Congress Legislature Party Leader pointed out.

Accusing the government for the plight of farmers in the state, he blamed Naiduâ€™s rule for the suicides of farmers.

The Telugu Desam government, the Congress Legislature Party Leader said, had failed even in the development of industries, employment generation, handloom sector and law and order situation in the state.

5,J&K polls won’t be peaceful: Farooq,"TIRUPATI: Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Farooq Abdullah said here on Sunday that the elections to the state Assembly â€˜â€˜will not be peacefulâ€™â€™ but reiterated his commitment to go ahead with the elections â€˜â€˜in order to restore democracy in the troubled regionâ€™â€™.

â€˜â€˜Since Pakistan continues to send infiltrators across the border targeting political leaders, police, Army and para- military officials, also killing thousands of innocent people, we donâ€™t expect the elections to be peaceful,â€™â€™ Farooq Abdullah said. The funding to the militant agencies, however, had come down thanks to the global effect, he added.

The National Conference leader was speaking here during his pilgrimage to offer prayers to Lord Venkateshwara in Tirumala.

Offering a solution to the long-drawn conflict in Kashmir, he said, â€˜â€˜The present Kashmir is an integral part of India and the other part of the Kashmir should be left to Pakistan, provided Pakistan stops its anti-India stand for lasting peace in the region.â€™â€™

He opined that a permanent solution to the Kashmir issue could be found only through talks between India and Pakistan and not through war. â€˜â€˜Our neighbour must realise this and stop cross-border terrorism and proxy war immediately,â€™â€™ he added.

He said NC opposed governorâ€™s rule as there was no precedent of it. The election process in the state has been taken care of by the EC and it is their mission to conduct the procedures in a fair manner, he said.

Wishing luck to Ram Jethmalani, who has been trying to bring the separatist groups into the mainstream, Farooq said, â€˜â€˜Let him meet Musharraf to talk to the various separatist leaders who are still hiding in Pakistan.â€™â€™

6,Markets to rally on UTI bailout deal,"MUMBAI: The stock markets are all set to bounce back on Monday following the governmentâ€™s announcement of a bail-out package for the Unit Trust of India, which has effectively ruled out any more distress sale by the Trust, said domestic fund managers. â€˜â€˜This move is quite positive for the capital market. Moreover, for UTI investors, this package will provide the much-needed comfort level. We expect the markets to rally on this news,â€™â€™ said Rajiv Vij of Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund. â€˜â€˜The biggest overhang on the market currently is the continuous supply of stocks from the beleaguered UTI. The Trust was selling to meet redemption pressures even as its flagship scheme, the US-64, with a Rs 8,000 crore equity portfolio, opens up for redemption early next year,â€™â€™ said an analyst in a top brokerage house. â€˜â€˜This, coupled with the redemption pressures on various assured return schemes in a span of 10 months, would have seen UTI sales touching a staggering Rs 10,000 crore. The government has managed to avert this crisis,â€™â€™ noted a fund manager. Over the past five months, UTI witnessed redemptions of Rs 8,000 crore, including Rs 6,200 crore towards the closure of various schemes. This means that an outflow of Rs 1,800 crore was witnessed from various other open-ended schemes due to adverse market sentiments. The decision to bifurcate UTI into two different companies will check this redemption pressure. UTI holds substantial stakes in leading companies, and of late the Trust has effectively used the option of strategic selling. However, only 25-30 per cent of the sales could have been achieved by way of strategic sales and the remaining open market sales have dampened market sentiments. The UTI package means that the Trust need not offload its holdings in the open market to meet redemption pressures, since the government has offered to meet all its liquidity requirements.

12,Karunakaran flays govt decision to hike power tariff,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Senior Congress leader K Karunakaran on Monday strongly criticised the party-led United Democratic Front government''s decision to hike power tariff in Kerala, saying, ""it is difficult for the party to remain silent watching government steps that creates hardship to people"".

Addressing a press conference here, he demanded re-consideration of the decision and said the tariff rate in the new form could not be continued indefinitely.

The matter was not discussed in any of the party forums, he said, adding, ""meeting of the party legislature and KPCC executive was not convened even for once to discuss it.""

""I am enraged over the government neglecting the party before taking up such a major issue,"" Karunakaran said, adding, ""whatever may the other leaders think about it"".

He said the party would try to sort out the issue without causing further hardship to the people. In this regard, he said, ""Electricity Minister Kadavoor Shivadasan has promised me that he is ready to review the decision as per the directions of the government and the party"".

Taking strong exception to the reported remarks of cabinet ministers against the government decision, Karunakaran said it reflected that the Cabinet lacked collective responsibility.

Karunakaran said the attempt to make Shivadasan, a known (I) group loyalist, a scapegoat in the issue would not be successful.

15,Venkaiah rules out change of guard in Kerala BJP,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: BJP President Venkaiah Naidu on Monday ruled out a change of leadership in the party''s Kerala unit, headed by C K Padmanabhan.

""I want to make it clear that no change is contemplated. The unit will complete its tenure,"" Naidu told a meet-the-press programme here.

He said the state party had been asked to explore the possibilities of getting ""regional parties with national outlook"" as allies.

The party leaders had also been asked to work out an action plan to expand its base in the state, where the BJP is yet to enter the state assembly, he said.

""The party in Kerala needs to expand its social base by enlisting support from farmers, fishermen, artisans and minorities,"" he said.

By tying up with regional parties, BJP could emerge as an alternative to the Congress-led UDF and CPI (M)-led LDF, who had alternately ""ruled and ruined the state"", Naidu said.

Criticising the steep increase in power charges by the UDF government, Venkaiah, said Chief Minister A K Antony, was oblivious of the fact that his party was in the forefront of struggle against power tariff hike in Andhra Pradesh.

""Congress in Andhra Pradesh says power can be given free. AICC has endorsed this. Antony can interact with AICC and get guidance how to give free power,"" he added.

17,Pak won't succeed in disturbing J&K polls: Advani,"BIJAPUR, Karna: The Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani on Monday, asserted that Pakistan would not succeed in its bid to disturb the Jammu and Kashmir elections through terrorism and said the ongoing talks with the leaders of that state would continue after the polls.

Addressing a public meeting in Gulbarga, Advani said India was determined to continue its war on terrorism until the menace was crushed.

India, he said, would fight the war on its own strength without ''outside'' help.

Advani said Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf was constantly claiming about stopping infiltration into India. However, the situation on the ground was different and it was, in fact, continuing.

The government, he said, was also determined to identify the ISI activities and put an end to it.

Advani also said, the government had decided to conduct elections in Jammu and Kashmir, in an impartial and smooth manner and ""more and more"" people should participate in it.

Blaming Pakistan for resorting to terrorism to disturb elections in Jammu and Kashmir, he said its ""dream"" would not materialise. All other countries in the world had realised the attitude of Pakistan towards India and had warned Islamabad to give it up, he said.

Advani said BJP-led NDA, was providing a better administration and asserted that it would again come back to power under the leadership of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.

Referring to the drought situation, he said though it was severe, no starvation death had been reported in any part of the country. The country had sufficient stocks of foodgrains and a task force formed under him to meet the drought situation, he said.

18,Another dry week will spell disaster for farmers,"HUBLI: If the cloudy sky fails to open up in a week''s time, a majority of districts in north Karnataka, including the Hubli-Dharwad belt, will face yet another crop disaster forcing the Karnataka government to take up an extensive salvage exercise.

""The farmers here are badly in need of rain as crops in the area have reached the most crucial stage of growth -- the reproductive stage,"" said an officer of the agriculture department.

As eager, if not more, are the citizens, with the HDMC forewarning them of a terrible drinking water crisis in the coming months, if the monsoon fails to come by.

After a delay of over a month, the central and a few parts of northern Karnataka received incessant rain in the first week of August, inspiring farmers to take up sowing operations, Kulkarni, technical officer in the Agriculture Department at Dharwad, said.

Predicting poor rain this time, he said the department had set a target of 1.59 lakh hectares, covering jowar, potato, onion, chilly and groundnut crops. However, the department managed to surpass the set target by 3 lakh hectares. This, he said, was because of extensive rains in the month of August.

In July, the district received 39.5 mm as against the normal rainfall of 110 mm. However, it recorded 114.99 mm rainfall in August, exceeding the normal level. This encouraged the department and farmers to take up extensive agriculture operations, the officer explained.

Nevertheless, the situation is back to square one with the parched conditions destroying crops and cattle, and threatening to choke the district''s nascent economic recovery, Kulkarni rued.

""If the situation continues, farmers committing suicide due to crop loss and migrating to cities in search of work will become common. Until now, they were looked upon as distress signals,"" said a worried farmer leader S. Kale.

Nargund, a supervisor with the Agricultural Cooperative Society, said the monsoon is crucial to Hubli''s economic performance, and is considered a major business centre of the state after Bangalore, as agriculture contributes about 70 per cent of employment.

If the agricultural sector fails, the whole economy starts looking insipid. Recovery could be hit as rural incomes nosedive after drought. Poor farmers who usually borrow money to buy seeds and fertilisers are the worst-hit, he added.

In a good year, with abundant rain leading to bumper crops, they can repay their loans and still make a little money. This, in turn, triggers demand for goods in rural areas, boosting economic growth. But when crops fail, farmers sink deeper into debt, rural incomes fall and demand slows down.

The state government, though, has recognised that more than half the state is in the grip of a severe drought, and the administration is yet to take up relief work positively, complained many farmers leaders.

19,BJP `backs' disinvestment of oil PSUs,"NEW DELHI: Caught between Samata Party George Fernandes'' criticism of the government decision to disinvest oil sector PSUs without considering the security aspect and a BJP-led government going full steam ahead with the process, the BJP on Monday issued a neutral statement supporting disinvestment in principle, saying it was for the government to decide which PSU should be privatised and through which methodology.

But clearly, Fernandes'' warning appears to have struck a chord within a section of the BJP. A senior BJP leader said: ``There can be no argument on the question of disinvestment as a principle. We are for it, but this statement only focusses on the disinvestment that has already taken place and does not address the security question at all. What about the supply of oil during an emergency? A party like the BJP whose identity is tied up with national security cannot afford to ignore this point.''''

These sources pointed out that the government could go ahead with its disinvestment of the oil PSUs provided it made some alternative arrangement for the supply of oil during an emergency like war, such as an oil levy. But this, these sources stressed, militated against the programme of economic reforms to which the government was committed.

The other possibility, these sources said, was to sell the oil PSUs to financial institutions controlled by the government. While this would guarantee functional autonomy and no political interference, the government''s supply of oil would be ensured. The National Security Advisory Board, too, had in its recommendations last year said that provision for enough oil for emergencies should be provided.

Simultaneously, the RSS, too, is trying to convey its concerns to the Prime Minister and the Deputy PM about the security aspect of selling off the oil sector PSUs.

Meanwhile, BJP spokesperson Arun Jaitley, who issued the party statement on disinvestment, answering a question about Fernandes'' suggestion for a mid-term review and a discussion among key ministers on the disinvestment policy, said: ``Any suggestion to discuss and review performances and policies should always be undertaken. There is nothing wrong in it. A government must always be open and amenable to all good suggestions.'''' On Samata MP Raghunath Jha''s opposition to the privatisation of HPCL and BPCL, he said,

``The BJP does not get into individual cases. The party gives its views on the merits of a policy,'''' and added that it was best left to the ``collective wisdom of the government''''.

Illustrating the success of the government''s disinvestment programme in the last three years, Jaitley said in a statement: ``The programme has brought about efficiency, growth and a turnaround in the performance of several erstwhile PSUs.'''' Listing some ``success'''' stories, Jaitley said the Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Delhi and West Bengal governments, among others, had now begun privatising through strategic sales.

He said the fear of retrenchment of labour had been dispelled and loss-making units, that would have resulted in closure and loss of jobs, had been turned around with prospects of creating more jobs.

Pointing to a 75 per cent increase in the market index of PSUs during the last six months, Jaitley said the sensex had gained through PSU-driven market for the first time in history, with the PSUs gaining Rs 70,000 crore and the government Rs 50,000 crore.

20,"J&K Pandits meet Kalam, to boycott polls","NEW DELHI: Panun Kashmir leaders on Monday met President A P J Abdul kalam and sought a ``political space'''' for the displaced Kashmiri Pandits in Jammu and Kashmir and told reporters later: ``The Pandits will boycott the assembly elections as they do not address our problems.''''

Panun Kashmir convener Agnishekhar: ``Whom do we vote for? After 13 years of exile, we don''t know anyone there. For all you know, we may be voting for some ISI agent or a militant. Obviously we don''t want to do that.''''

However, he clarified that the Pandit boycott of elections should not be clubbed with the boycott by the Hurriyat Conference. ``There is a difference. We believe in the Constitution and in the process of election. But the condition under which the present state elections are being held will not redress our grievances.''''

He chanrged the Election Commission with ``hoodwinking'''' the country on the issue of Kashmir elections. ``Unfortunately, the EC has displayed double standards while discharging its duties. It postponed elections in Gujarat just because 16,000 people are displaced whereas polls are being held in J&K despite an entire community of over 3.5 lakh Kashmiri Pandits having been displaced,'''' Agnishekhar said.

Stating that the Pandits had not been able to go back to their homes for the last 13 years, he said: ``The talk of setting up polling booths for the displaced Pandits in Jammu and Delhi is a half-hearted attempt at providing legitimacy to the electoral process in Kashmir.''''

Earlier, Agnishekhar along with Moti Kaul and Ramesh Manvati apprised Kalam about the ``sufferings'''' of the community displacement after outbreak of militancy in 1989 and the ``neglect'''' by all successive governments.

They told the President of the need for creating a ``sufficient political space'''' for the displaced community to ``facilitate their permanent return to the Valley''''. ``The ultimate solution to the problem in Kashmir can only be achieved through the state''s political re-organisation,'''' Agnishekhar said.
