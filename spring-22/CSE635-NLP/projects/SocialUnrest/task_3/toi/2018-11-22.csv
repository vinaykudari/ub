1,LUTA election: 36 in fray for 24 posts,"lucknow: while the nomination paper of a candidate for the president's post of lucknow university teachers' association (luta) was cancelled a day after the scrutiny of papers was over, 36 others remained in fray for the 24 different posts after withdrawal of papers by 20 candidates on wednesday. according to reports, the nomination paper of rk pandey of dental faculty, who had filed papers for contesting the president's post, was cancelled on wednesday by returning officer rbs verma. the nomination was cancelled on the grounds that pandey had already represented the luta executive for the two consecutive terms. as per the luta constitution, a person, who has represented the executive body for the two consecutive terms, cannot seek re-election. however, pandey, raising objection over rejection of his nomination paper, questioned why the returning officer did not reject it earlier and why he sought the relevant information at the eleventh hour. threatening to move court against the returning officer's decision, he said that he was victimised as a powerful thakur lobby of kgmc teachers was against him. when contacted, the returning officer said that during scrutiny only credentials of the proposer and the seconder were checked. ""the anomaly was detected on wednesday when i tallied the list of candidates with the list of members who have represented the luta executive twice,"" he said. he, however, kept mum when asked whether any candidate complained about the anomaly in dr pandey's candidature. meanwhile, kapil lumba and an singh were elected unopposed as dental faculty representative and treasurer respectively following the withdrawal of nomination papers by 20 candidates on wednesday. two candidates each are vying for the president and general secretary's posts.

3,Cong-ruled civic body fails to provide water,"rajkot: the worst fears of the residents of newly-merged areas of the city, who are facing an acute water crisis, have come true. when the ruling congress at the rajkot municipal corporation had promised the residents that they would receive piped water supply soon after diwali, many of them had greeted the news with scepticism. a minority, however, had pinned their hopes on the party keeping its word and were anxiously waiting for the water to begin flowing from the taps. but the sceptical majority was proved right with no trace of water a week after diwali. the residents of the three new wards are now feeling let down and frustrated by the inaction on the part of the civic body. these areas were merged into the civic body in early 1998. interestingly, even as these areas awaited their first connection, as many as 2000 connections were doled out in the old rajkot areas. and all along, the civic authorities maintained a stoic silence when residents who had been 'sanctioned' tap connections queried them on the delay. sources in the water works department told 'the times of india' on wednesday that almost 40 per cent of the work still remains unfinished. only after this is completed can these areas receive water supply. they would not risk a guess on when this would happen. the civic body had planned to supply water to around 20,000 people in these areas. however, seeing the slackness in the civic body's approach to the project, only 5000 people filled the application form. a senior engineer in the rmc's water works department said that the work was in progress and had been entrusted to private contractors. the civic body hopes to provide water connections to almost 10,000 people. but even the work on laying the pipeline is yet to be completed. the engineer also revealed that the rmc's plans to regularise 'ghost' tap connections had flopped. meanwhile, the failure of the civic body to reach water to the newly-merged areas has come as a boon to owners of water tankers that are making as many as 900 trips even during these winter months. the situation is bound to worsen by the year-end when more and more water sources will dry up and the rmc will have to once gain depend on wankaner bore water supply.

4,"Terror law a blot on democracy, says panel","new delhi: the south asia human rights documentation centre (sahrdc) has described the prevention of terrorism ordinance (poto) as ''yet another blot on india's democratic fabric''. in a booklet on poto, ''government decides to play judge and jury'', released on tuesday, sahrdc says there is not a single provision in the ordinance — except those which contradict the crpc, ipc, evidence act or the constitution — that is not covered by existing laws such as the nsa, armed forces special powers act, unlawful activities (prevention) act, prevention of seditious meetings act and a host of other acts. the two new sections — not part of the law commission draft — pertaining to terrorist organisations and interception of communications in certain cases are covered by the unlawful activities (prevention) act and the information technology act, respectively. criticising the government's attempt to justify poto by pointing to anti-terrorism legislation in the us and uk, the booklet says these are ''flawed arguments''. the us anti-terrorism and effective death penalty act (aedpa) in no way limits fundamental rights guaranteed to all defendants in the criminal process. preventive detention on the grounds of a person's potential dangerousness is prohibited. even the usapatriot law passed after september 11 does not alter the criminal trial process for terrorism cases nor does it accord the executive powers immunised from meaningul judicial review. under the uk law, the extension of detention of an individual arrested under the act for up to five days with the home minister's permission has been held as a breach of article 5(3) of the european convention on human rights. ''if the four days of additional detention can constitute a breach of echr, then the extension of detention by 180 days under poto is harsh and illegitimate,'' the booklet says. calling poto more draconian than tada, sahrdc has compared the two. poto's definitions of terms like ''terrorist activities'', ''membership of a terrorist organisation'', ''concerned with terrorism'' — are sketchy and therefore ''highly susceptible to misuse''.

7,Six farmers hurt in clash over wages,"asansol: six farmers were injured in a clash at jalpara village in mongolkote police station area in katwa sub division here on wednesday. the trinamul congress blamed the krishak sabha, owing allegiance to the cpm, for the clash which broke out after negotiations with big farmers failed. for the past few days, farm labourers began cease-work demanding rs 25 per day and two kg rice. the rich landowners agreed to pay rs 23 and two kg rice in the course of a meeting. suddenly, a group of people attacked the peasants with lathi, tangi and other sharp weapons. six peasants were admitted to katwa subdivisional hospital. the condition of two are said to be critical. dr anirban roy, asp of asansol, said that one person has been arrested in this connection and the situation is under control. according to the cpm zonal committee, no party is involved in the trouble. they blamed the trinamul for bringing politics into the matter. while trinamul leader binoy ghosh alleged that the cpm is attacking innocent party cadres and not allowing them to work on the fields if they do not join their party.

8,Benefits of MSP elude farmers,"jodhpur: benefits of the minimum support price mechanism have not percolated down to the primary stake holders (majority of farmers), said v s vyas, member, economic advisory council to the prime minister. speaking at a function organised by the aravali institute of management, an affiliate of the marwar education foundation, vyas said the government has failed to react pro-actively in the agriculture sector, allowing the economy to flounder further. this has led to a situation wherein one finds overflowing granaries on one hand and poverty on the other. due to manipulation of the minimum support price mechanism, granaries are filled with poor quality grains, while the good quality grains are sold at higher value in the open market. besides, he said, farmers who do not have the means to hold on to their produce till a support price was declared are the most affected. they suffer irreparable losses. in either cases, he added, the richer farmers make most of the situation. ""our stress should be on increasing productivity...creating effective demand by increasing production and generating employment in the rural sector will help the industries to respond and induce confidence in the market, which is lacking at the moment due to recession."" he said all economic policies in future will target at harnessing the abundantly available natural and human resources to ameliorate the deprived sections of the society. ""to tide over the current gloomy picture of the economy, the government has to put all its efforts towards strengthening the rural sector. we are not ready for complete globalisation as relative wages are less here. going en masse for privatisation will not lead to sustainable growth,"" he said. on the education front, he said the responsibility lies on the state government. the state government cannot abdicate its responsibility towards higher education and leave it entirely at the mercy of the private sector. it cannot limit itself to primary education. in a country like india, the government plays a pivotal role in quality control and laying broad standards of education notwithstanding the contributions from the private sector.

9,Lapse in law & order caused Bihar train mishap,"new delhi: there are varying versions among the railway officials about tuesday's rail accident near lakhisarai in bihar. the freak accident that took a toll of 15, one of them a railway employee, is being blamed alternatively on the law and order enforcing officials and the driver. the 214 dn mokama-howrah passenger train, stalled because of an engine failure, was hit from the rear by another engine at around 5 pm on tuesday. according to initial reports, the tragedy occurred due to the crowding of the diesel engine by unauthorised passengers. all those who died were travelling on the engine. ""the driver's visibility was restricted due to some 25 passengers standing on either side of the engine. it is a normal practice in bihar to travel on the diesel engine holding on to its railings on either side. but this restricts the driver's visibility. this could be the reason why the engine rammed into the train ahead,"" said a senior railway board official. the mokama-howrah train was stationary since its engine had failed at 4.20 pm near dumri station. to push the train off to the next station and thus to clear the track, another engine was detached from another passenger train. this engine, instead of pushing the train ahead to the next station, collided with the stationary train, causing the accident. since neither the engine driver nor any passenger in the stationary train died, officials feel the accident has been caused because of the poor law and order situation, resulting in unauthorised travelling on the engine. but the railway protection force officials in charge of rail security and law and order assert that the driver should not have permitted anyone to travel on the engine. ""in bihar, it is difficult to stop people from travelling on the engine. but the death of a railway employee travelling in the engine shows that the driver was negligent. the driver knew where the stationary train was. moreover, he was on a rescue operation. in such a situation, the death of passengers on the engine clearly implies that the driver was negligent or speeding,"" said an rpf official. the commissioner for railway safety will soon initiate an investigation into the accident. till then, the death of 15 people will be blamed on ""lawless bihar"" and the driver of the engine, which was rammed into the stationary train.

10,CM calls all-party meeting on cotton purchasescheme,"mumbai: chief minister vilasrao deshmukh has convened an all-party meeting on saturday to persuade the centre to ease banking norms to the state cooperative banks so as to facilitate financing of the ambitious cotton monopoly purchase scheme. ``we will request the union government to consider our request to relax the rbi rules concerning lending by cooperative banks. the state cooperative bank has agreed to lend rs 500 crore for the scheme but for the restrictions imposed by the rbi. moreover, the centre should favourably consider our demand to raise rs 500 crore from the market,'' mr deshmukh said at a press conference held at mantralaya after the cabinet meeting on wednesday. he said the state government would release payments to the cotton farmers in three instalments, with the first instalment of 80 per cent of the price to be released immediately. the remaining two instalments will be paid to the farmer in due course, he said. the state government has announced a support price of rs 2,400 on every qunital of cotton purchased under the monopoly procurement scheme. this is over rs 400 from the support price for cotton announced by the centre. under the scheme, launched three decades ago, the state is the monopoly buyer of cotton from the farmers. although the state has suffered losses to the tune of over rs 1,000 crore, political considerations outweigh pragmatic policy plan. mr deshmukh said the state government has opened 175 procurement centres and has acquired seven lakh quintals of cotton bales after the scheme was launched on november 7. the all-party meeting to be held at sahyadri, the state guest house, at malabar hill will be attended by union minister's manohar joshi, suresh prabhu, balasaheb vikhe-patil, nationalist congress party president sharad pawar, members of the df coordination committee and senior state cabinet ministers. the meeting will also discuss the issues concerning the reforms in the power sector and amendments to the labour laws among others things, mr deshmukh said. earlier, mr deshmukh announced that a separate corporation for ex-servicemen will be launched to facilitate employment and self-employment opportunities for them. the ex-servicemen corporation will have a share capital of rs five crore and will be based in pune, he said, adding that there are 1.83 lakh ex-servicemen in maharashtra. he also announced that private companies which are engaged in the laying of optic fibres lines across the state will now have to pay in cash for the right of way license to the state government, as against the earlier arrangement of cashless equity.

11,"Bt cotton safe, says govt","new delhi: the department of biotechnology has said that scientific experiments have shown genetically-modified, insect-protected bt cotton is safe. the department has said bt cotton enhances yield by 40 per cent and reduces the need for chemical pesticides. in response to a question in parliament, the department said its job is to promote the development and safe use of all gm substances. its review committee on genetic manipulation evaluated the cotton over three years and found the product safe in small-scale trials. since then, the union environment ministry's genetic engineering approval committee has authorised large-scale trials (by maharashtra hybrid seed company) for agronomic evaluation as well as more information on food safety of bt cotton by conducting feeding trials in cattle, buffalo, birds and fish. the results indicate bt cotton has no harmful effect either as food or feed on the animals in question. residues of bt protein in soil were either non-existent or in extremely low quantities and did not have any adverse effect on the microbial populations of soil samples, says the department's response. however, it does not mention that the large-scale trials are still on.

12,Bt cotton seed sellers face arrest,"new delhi: a gujarat court has issued arrest warrants against officials of the firm which is said to have sold transgenic cotton seeds to farmers without the mandatory permission from the centre, say union environment ministry officials pursuing a criminal complaint against the company. a two-man ministry team returned to delhi wednesday with this news. but the team could not meet state government officials - it was supposed to get feedback on the state's effort to implement a central government order to procure the cotton crop still standing, process it, destroy the seed and store the lint, and retrieve what has reached the market, again destroying the seed and storing the lint. these orders came last month from the ministry's genetic engineering approval committee (geac), the lone sanctioning authority for even large-scale trials on gm crops. no gm crop has so far been authorised for commercial cultivation in india, with studies on environmental and health impacts yet to be completed. in this case, the company in question, navbharat seeds, did not even apply for any of the permissions needed, say officials. by all accounts, the state government doesn't seem to have got very far in retrieving this cotton, forcing ministry officials to admit most of the transgenic crop may not be recovered - and forcing them to look on this as an ""educational"" exercise. nor has the environment ministry got feedback from any other state where the company is said to have sold the same seed - on the list are andhra pradesh, punjab and maharashtra.

13,Terror law smacks of Nazi ideology: Mulayam,"new delhi: samajwadi party president mulayam singh yadav has demanded that the prevention of terrorist ordnance (poto) be withdrawn by the government immediately without any further attempt to sell it with minor modifications. ""the poto is a symbol of fascist rule, so there can not be any compromise on it,"" he told reporters here on wednesday. explaining his party's strong opposition to the ordinance, yadav said such legislations giving sweeping power to the law enforcement agencies had been grossly misused by the police in the past. ""it smacks of nazi political ideology,"" he observed. he recalled that even the jan sangh founder shyama prasad mukherjee had opposed such a stringent law. ""it becomes an instrument of harassment,"" he said pointing out how a large number of his party activists had been arrested under the now-defunct tada. ""there is no scope for any amendment, it should be withdrawn,"" he said claiming such law negated the concept of natural justice. he deplored the government's reported move to get the ordinance passed by placing it before a joint session of both houses, since the ruling coalition was in a minority in the rajya sabha. making a politically significant remark, mulayam expressed satisfaction over the congress statement that an ordinance of such far-reaching consequences had been brought without any prior consultation with the political parties. he alleged that the ordinance has been brought keeping uttar pradesh elections in mind. ""armed with the poto they want to target us,"" he said. regretting home minister advani's remark that those opposing the poto were abetting terrorism, mulayam found in it an echo of us president george bush. ""they are speaking the same language,"" he said. reiterating that his party was committed to fighting terrorism, he said, ""terrorists are sneaking into the country through the border because of the confusion in the government's policy and approach.""

14,"It’s time for a change, say principals","new delhi: when some of the nation's finest school principals gather to suggest a revamp of the education system, the government had better listen. especially, when they tell the government to stop meddling with education. at the second national seminar of principals held at bishop cotton school, shimla, the recommendations ranged from an overhaul of the 10+2 system to a greater interface with the growing service sector. from anil wilson, principal of the nation's premier college, st stephen's, came the most drastic suggestion. ''senior educationists should form a coordinating body to monitor changes in the educational sphere at all levels,'' wilson said. principals such as farida abraham of la martiniere (girls), lucknow, shomie das, formerly of mayo college, ajmer, and jyotsna brar, welham girls high school, dehra dun, were almost unanimous in their belief that the current system of education places far too much emphasis on memorising. which is why, according to kabir mustafi, headmaster of bishop cotton, though a 90 per cent in languages, literature, history and economics is within the grasp of most hardworking children now, standards have dropped. ''a vast majority of these 90 percenters,'' he said, ''cannot write as well as the 'ordinary' first division student of yesteryear.'' mustafi points out that the 10+2 system had presumed that 40 per cent of the school children would opt out of academics after class x. but they hadn't bargained for the job market being unable to absorb school-leavers. branding the ncert attempt to develop a national curriculum framework as complete high-handedness, he's suggested instead that schools be allowed to frame their own curricula till class viii. he's also suggested a parallel technical stream and a college assessment test to be administered jointly by all school examination boards after class 12. ''are we going to settle for anything less than good,'' asked francis fanthome, chief executive and secretary of the council for the indian school certificate examinations. especially for the ''first generation of global citizens''? indeed.

15,'Civic elections would be heldas scheduled on Feb 10',"mumbai: even if the state government decides to go ahead with thedissolution of the brihanmumbaimunicipal corporation (bmc), thecivic elections would be held as scheduled on february 10, state electioncommissioner yeshwant rajwade,in-charge of conducting the elections, said. the chief minister vilaraso deshmukh's announcement that the stategovernment will initiate the processof dissolution of the bmc as recommended by the tinaikar committee``has nothing to do with our due process of election,'' he said. ``it is the state's prerogative to dowhat it will with the bmc. it doesnot matter to me whether the bmcis dissolved today, tomorrow or oneday before the election. the poll willbe held on time,'' he stressed. mantralaya sources said the dissolution of the bmc, if it does happen,would take place under section 520(b) of the bombay municipal corporation act 1888, whereas the election would be held in accordancewith the rules laid down by the election commission. ``the timing of thestate government's announcementof action against the current bmcdispensation is coincidentally closeto the election schedule, but there isno reason to assume that one wouldhave a bearing on the other,'' a senior official said. asked whether any corporator indicted by the tinaikar report wouldhurt his chances of standing for elections, mr rajwade said, ``a corporator disqualified as a member of thebmc does not ipso facto get disqualified as an election candidate,'' saysmr rajwade. ``if the corporation isdissolved, he ceases to be a corporator. this has no bearing on his nomination provided he meets the eligibility criteria specified by electioncommission rules and the representation of people act 1951,'' hepoints out. to be disqualified, a person has tobe convicted ``for committing an offence under the indian penal codeor any of the special acts by a judicialcourt or a quasi-judicial authority ofany authority empowered under thebmc act or rules,'' mr rajwadesaid. section 16 of the bmc act dealswith provisions for disqualification.``conviction for an offence listed inthis section is necessary for us to baranybody from standing for electionsif he meets the eligibility conditions,'' he added. mantralaya officials expect theprocess of convicting a corporatorfor alleged irregularities to takelonger than the dissolution. the process of dissolution alone would takeat least two months, says a mantralaya official. to be disqualified, hehas to be convicted before the lastdate of withdrawal of nominations. this is a distant possibility, officials contend. ``it may be safe to assume that any corporator, even iffound guilty by the tinaikar committee, would be free at least to fightthis election,'' says a senior official. however, if convicted after thedate of withdrawal of nominations,the person would be penalised withdisqualification after he is elected,mr rajwade points out. ``one thingis clear: once convicted, a candidatecannot escape disqualification eitherbefore or after the elections,'' hesays. as of now, though, the coast isclear and there is no undue concernon account of the tinaikar report onpolitical futures of our city fathers.the only thing that occupies thecommon mind is the timing and purpose of dissolution. says kisan mehta, president ofthe save bombay committee, ``theprescription is worse than the disease. supersession means removingthe elected authority and making themunicipal commissioner the policymaker and the administrator. inother words, it would vest unreasonable and unchallenged powers withhim.'' this, he contends, makes no sensesince the municipal commissionertoo has been indicted in the tinaikarreport. a former bureaucrat, whodoes not want to be named, soundscaution on the timing of the dissolution exercise. ``i fear that the chiefminister has timed it now so that hecan stall the elections. it is the stategovernment's prerogative to extendthe tenure of the corporation. afterinitiating the process of dissolution,the state government can ask to extend the tenure of the corporation,which in effect would extend the tenure of the commissioner as corporation.''

""purno sangma is misleading the people by making a tall claim that the ncp and the opposition parties are going to form an alternative government by replacing me,"" mawlong told newsmen here. the chief minister, who on wednesday night redistributed the portfolios of the two former bjp and two ncp ministers, said that he, on the other hand, had secured the support of two mlas of the opposition - the lone mla of the garo national council (gnc) clifford marak and an independent, augustine syiem. giving the break-up of the 37 legislators who ""solidly"" supported the ruling coalition, he said that these 21 belonged to the united democratic party (udp), 13 to the meghalaya national congress legislature party (mnclp), one to the people's democratic movement (pdm), one each from the gnc and the independent.

26,ER officers to protest against pay disparity,"kolkata: around 600 officers in the group b category of eastern railway feel discriminated against because of pay disparity with their group a counterparts. according to them, this discrimination is utterly unjustified since both groups have similar duties. general secretary of the eastern railway promotee officers' association, k.l. chowdhury, said that while a person recruited to group a through the upsc received a higher scale of rs 8,000-rs 13,500, a person promoted from group b to group a got a lower scale of rs 7,500-rs 12,000 in spite of the same nature of their jobs and interchangeable duties. this discrimination, said chowdhury, existed at the level of assistant manager only and not in the case of senior scale officers. a senior scale group b officer, when promoted to group a, got the same salary as an assistant officer in group a promoted to senior rank, he said. even where promotions were concerned, group a had it easier, chowdhury said. while an assistant officer in group a was promoted to the post of officer in only three years, the promotion of a senior officer in group b to the same rank in group a required a lot of recommendation from higher authorities, he added. chowdury also said that the discrimination in salary also did not exist at the lower grades. a group d employee when promoted to clerk in group c got the same salary as a clerk in the latter category. chowdhury alleged that the eastern railway authorities had promised to rectify the anomaly but then did nothing. he also claimed that the recommendations of the tandon committee for removing this discrimination had been flouted. around 8,000 group b officers will organise a fast in new delhi on december 7. as a prelude to this event, the officers organised demonstrations at fairlie place and other er offices on wednesday.

27,"Varsity opposes govt directive, refuses admissions","bangalore: the rajiv gandhi university of health sciences has strongly opposed the karnataka government's decision asking it to admit students to the first year mbbs course. the university has reportedly told the government it cannot admit students in violation of the academic calendar of events. the government has so far not responded to the university's terse tone. the controversy arose when the government approved a new medical college, m.v.j. medical college, near whitefield, in october and directed the common entrance test cell to admit students. the cet cell completed admission process on november 9 and 10 and allotted 50 seats under the general merit quota. the college -- accorded the minority status -- was given 50 more seats to be filled under management quota. according to the university's academic calendar of events drawn up in july, the last date for admission was september 30, with a penal fee of rs 100 up to october 31. classes commenced in november. ``the calendar of events was drawn up in july and sent to the government. fully aware of this, how can the government try to disrupt the academic calendar? it would be difficult for students to cope with the syllabus,'' university sources said. the medical education secretary is said to have had a meeting with university officials asking them to be ``considerate'' on the issue. however, the university has not changed its stance. meanwhile, the government officials contend the university has no choice but to approve admissions. the university cannot refuse to approve admissions when the government has approved the college, they said. ``the centre delayed approving the college. we could do little in such circumstances,'' sources said. college authorities said they were confident of getting the university nod. ``the government legally approved the college and directed the cet cell to allot seats. the university has to approve the admissions,'' they added.

28,Medicinal plants could tone up farmers' lot,"pathankot: though punjab agriculture university, ludhiana has a full-fledged agriculture research centre at gurdaspur, it has done little research on important medicinal plants, found in abundance in dhar kalan sub-division of the district. the district ayurvedic and unani officer of gurdaspur, dr sarabjit singh says while the relevance of ayurveda in modern times has increased globally, more funding is needed for research on medicinal plants that are on the verge of extinction in the shivalik region of the state. while there is a need to preserve the existing varieties of medicinal plants, financial resources from different funding agencies, like indian council for agricultural research and csir are needed for the collaborative programme for extension of medicinal and aromatic plant cultivation and processing, say experts. dr sudhir mahotra, director of pathankot institute of ecology and environment, in his study, has listed medicinal plants like shivlingi, basaka, tulsi, kachnar, harad, amla, reetha and amaltas, once found commonly in dhar kalan sub-division, that are now on the verge of extinction. while adarsh bharti college of pharmacy has grown 50 species of such medicinal plants for research, experts are of the opinion that the pau centre at gurdaspur, which has done pioneering work in the field of horticulture, could take up research on important medicinal plants in the sub-division. while the rare medicinal plants on which research can be concentrated include rose, damascena, lavender, melissa, salvia and glycerhiza, the planting material for these can be obtained from csir and the pau centre at gurdaspur could provide infrastructural facilities like building, land and agricultural inputs for crop-based field experiments. experts say the pau research sub-station has so far concentrated on developing new crop varieties, horticulture and floriculture, but could now expand its research operation to medicinal plants. this would improve the lot of punjab's farmers, given that medicinal plants are much in demand in the global market. while the climate of the shivalik area is conducive for growth of medicinal plants, pau could set-up a research sub-station in the dhar kalan sub-division on the pattern of the research sub-station set up at salooni, near chamba (hp) in 1987.

31,Govt's move on slum height a reversal of policy,"mumbai: the democratic front government's move to allow the height of slums to be increased upto 14 feet is in sharp conflict with its own policy of not tolerating any structure cropping up after january 1, 1995.``if the government has banned the horizontal expansion of slums after this cut-off date, how can it allow the vertical growth of slums and yet call it legal,'' top government sources told this newspaper. there is already strong opposition among bureaucrats and law-abiding citizens to the government's controversial proposal.observers say this proposal, if implemented, could be challenged in a court of law as any structure that is higher than 10 feet - even if it is built prior to 1995 - is illegal and can be demolished by the authorities.hence, vertical expansion on existing structures is also unauthorised and officials who fail to demolish such extensions can be criminally prosecuted and jailed under the amendments made to the slum act.``here, the government itself is committing an illegal act by giving permission to raise the height upto 14 feet,'' sources say. it is learnt that certain congress politicians, whose vote-banks depend primarily on people who do not have their roots in maharashtra, are behind the move to increase the height of slums.``with elections round the corner, they want to accommodate more people from their region into their constituencies. it is cold-blooded vote-bank politics,'' say sources.the general perception is that tax-paying and law-abiding citizens do not matter any more, considering that more than 60 per cent of the city's population live in slums.``it is going to devastate the city. the chief minister is sending a clear signal that all those coming into mumbai will get free accommodation,'' says neera punj of the citizens' forum for protection of open spaces.``if necessary, we will file a writ petition in the high court. citizens are going to reach out and scream. development control regulations cannot be changed without consulting anyone,'' she says.says adolf tragler, director of the slum rehabilitation society, ``it is a short-sighted move and will only perpetuate further growth of slums. the situation will get out of control when the main objective should be to reduce slums.''according to him, if the slum- density is less, the occupants will find their own solutions. ``allowing them to raise the height of their structures will not help them get out of the illegal situation they are in. the solution is to give them the title of the land so that they can mortgage their dwellings to raise loans. they must have access to corporate finance,'' mr tragler observes.a senior mantralaya bureaucrat, not wishing to be quoted, describes the government's proposal as ``undesirable''. ``it will lead to further densification of slums. the situation is bound to deteriorate as more people will be confined in a limited space. in my opinion, the government will becompounding an illegality if it implements this proposal,'' he says.according to this official, the city is in danger of suffocating and its development is likely to suffer. mumbai has a pathetic 0.3 acre of open space for every 1,000 residents, as compared to four acres in delhi and 3.8 acres in calcutta. the uncontrolled growth of slums is strangulating the city.sources say that although hutments coming up after january 1995 are to be demolished, several lakh illegal structures have cropped up on open spaces since then, in connivance with politicians, government officials and slum-lords.
