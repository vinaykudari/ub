1,NCP ministers hold closed-door meeting,"

MUMBAI: Three senior ministers of the Nationalist Congress Party â€”Dr Padamsinh Patil, PWD minister Vijaysinh Mohite Patil and tribal welfare minister Madhukar Pichad â€” held a closed-door meeting on Thursday after Dr Padamsinh Patil was divested of the important energy portfolio.

Party sources say the powerful Maratha lobby in the NCP is now gunning for deputy chief minister Chhagan Bhujbal who belongs to the OBC category. They want NCP leader Sharad Pawar to clip his wings by taking away the crucial home ministry portfolio and giving it to Ajit Pawar, Mr Sharad Pawarâ€™s nephew.

It is learnt that others who have extended their support to this emerging group within the NCP include, Ms Suryakanta Patil,Mr Shivajirao Giridhar Patil and Mr Datta Meghe. This group is unhappy with the importance given to Mr Bhujbal by Mr Pawar.

Mr Bhujbal said at a recent press conference that there would be no more ministry reshuffles nor would ministers be dropped. However, NCP spokesperson Vasant Chavan and state unit president Babanrao Pachpute have hinted that changes are likely after the crucial party meeting scheduled on January 7.

3,PU exams clash with IIT-JEE test,"MANGALORE: A section of parents in Mangalore have expressed concern that the dates of the II PUC examinations to be held in April are clashing with the IIT-JEE screening entrance examination. The timetable for the II PUC exams was published by the Directorate of Pre-University Education on Wednesday.

In a letter to the Director, R.D. Kini, a parent and also vice-president of the Kanara Chamber of Commerce and Industry, has stated that the IIT-JEE screening entrance examination is scheduled to be held on April 20, a Sunday. Since this is a screening test, many students of PUC (Science) from the state will be writing the examination.

According to the II PU timetable announced, Hindi, Urdu, Sanskrit and Telugu are to be held on Monday, April 21. Since Bangalore and Belgaum are the only centres in Karnataka for the IIT-JEE screening test, students from other places, especially rural and interior areas, will find it extremely difficult to commute back and forth, the letter stated. In this situation, students are left without any contingency plan due to lack of time, in case of any uncertainty arising such as breakdown of bus, bus strike or any other hurdle.

As an alternative, Kini suggested, the PU Directorate could conduct the exam on April 11, along with other language papers, or on Tuesday, April 22, to help out students.

4,Greens irked by state govt's refusal to aid transporters,"MUMBAI: The state governmentâ€™s refusal to financially aid transporters switching to cleaner vehicles has raised questions about its commitment to the environment. Despite repeated requests from clean air campaigners, the government is still to offer assistance to transporters who are required to opt for cleaner technologies.

An ongoing public interest litigation (PIL) on vehicular pollution seeks, among other things, to replace old vehicles with ones which meet stricter exhaust emission standards. Over 60 per cent of air pollution in the city is from vehicles.

Older taxis and auto-rickshaws have already opted for a cleaner fuel like compressed natural gas (CNG). But the high court has ordered that 15-year-old commercial vehicles must be scrapped or converted to cleaner fuels by December 31 2002. However, since conversion to CNG or liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) is currently not feasible for heavy and light commercial vehicles, and retrofitment of modern engines is also difficult, transporters have no choice but to buy new vehicles.

With taxes, a new truck complying with Euro II environment norms is priced between Rs 8 and Rs 10 lakhs. There are about 20,000 old heavy vehicles which need to be replaced. The heavy price tag and the lack of alternatives make it difficult for transporters to make the shift, prompting environmentalists to seek financial aid for them. The Bombay Environment Action Group (BEAG) has written to the transport department twice recently, citing the example of the Delhi government, which provided financial assistance to transporters after the supreme court directed the phasing out of such vehicles in the capital.

BEAG suggests that the government could exempt the new vehicles from sales tax (which is about 12 per cent), grant a subsidy on the interest payable on loans taken for buying such vehicles, exempt them from the annual motor vehicle tax for a few years, exempt partly or wholly octroi on such vehicles and even make a one-time financial grant to the vehicle owner.

â€œSince taxes form 30 to 40 per cent of the cost, exemption would make a huge difference for transporters,â€™â€™ says a campaigner. BEAG has stated that this â€œwould not only facilitate the phasing out of heavily polluting vehicles, but would also demonstrate the state governmentâ€™s commitment to improving air quality.â€™â€™

Officials are sceptical of a cash-starved government granting concessions to transporters. A campaigner pointed out that the government has received Rs 7 crores by way of fines from owners of polluting vehicles only because of the Pil. â€œSurely it can plough some of this money to subside the purchase of new vehicles.â€™â€™ The vehicle manufacturers have also ruled out the possibility of granting concessions to transporters.

Activists are asking who should pay for pollution control. Should it be only those who own the vehicles? Should it not also include others who have a stake in getting cleaner airâ€” the state government, which is responsible for both the health of its citizens as well as their livelihood, and the companies which profited for so many years on these technologies.

â€œWhen the person is being asked to make a drastic change in his life for such a reason, it is incumbent on the government to help him, because society as a whole benefits,â€™â€™ says transport consultant Bina Balakrishnan. Others believe the companies also have a responsibility to help by reducing prices. Perversely, the transporter unions refuse to see the writing on the wall. They have said they are not interested in aid for replacing their vehicles. They are hoping they will only have to change their engines.

5,Govt hospitals' charges increased by 10 pc,"LUCKNOW: Healthcare facilities for the poor in Uttar Pradesh has become more expensive. The state government has raised users charges in government hospitals by ten per cent. The order has come into force from January 1.

This is the third successive hike in the last three years. Users charges have been enforced in UP since July 1999 with a stipulated ten per cent hike each year.

As a result of the latest hike, the outdoor slip in all government hospital will now cost Rs eight as against Rs seven earlier. Charges for ultrasound will be Rs 200, while an ECG will cost Rs 65. The government expects to gross Rs 70 crore annually through the arrangement, although the income generated so far has fallen short by more than 50 per cent.

Although the move has hardly led to any criticism, there is considerable speculation about the manner in which the money is being utilised. It may be recalled that fifty per cent of the money accruing as users charges is to be used for better maintenance of hospitals. It has been more than three years since the system has come into force and there have hardly been any changes in the scene, said a senior surgeon at Balrampur Hospital on Thursday.

6,Parties ridicule notion of Sunday bandh,"KOLKATA: Political parties may hold a rally on Sunday, but there is no question of calling a bandh on this day.

""One would have to be stupid to call a bandh on Sunday. More than 75 per cent of the populace do not work on Sundays,"" says Party for Democratic Socialism general secretary Samir Putatunda.

SUCI state committee member Swapan Bose agrees. ""A bandh is a way of making yourself heard. Why would we want to organise one on a Sunday. The whole point is to stop work, so that people sit up and take notice"" he says. While the PDS has called a Bangla Bandh on January 10, a Friday, the one convened by SUCI is on Monday, January 27. The Trinamul Congress â€” proponents of convening rallies and bandhs on Sundays -- have also called for a rally at the Brigade Parade Ground on January 6, again a Monday.

The PDS and SUCI are Leftoriented parties and all three including Trinamul Congress claim to represent the interests of the working class. PDS and SUCI leaders on Thursday criticised chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee''s new ''work culture'' mantra and phrases like ''man-days lost'' as ""bourgeois terms aimed to destroy work environment"".

""Are bandhs by the working class to blame for man day losses? In 2002, strikes called by workers resulted in 15 or 16 factories being closed but at least 40 shut shop because of lock-outs declared by owners or due to mass retrenchment,"" Bose told TNN. Putatunda echoes the same sentiments.

""Yes I know some people will say that bandhs cripple work. But that is the idea. Rallies on a Sunday are fine, but a bandh has a totally different purpose,"" he said. ""We wanted to avoid a Friday because it gives everyone a long weekend. But with Makar Sankarnti and Gangasagar mela coming up, we had to call a bandh fast,"" he added.

Trinamul Congress leader Pankaj Banerjee however, sounded apologetic. ""We wanted to have the rally on Sunday. But the army did not oblige as they had parade practice on January 5. We still maintain rallies and meetings should be held on Sundays,"" he said. Surpsingly, in recent years it is the ruling Left Front that has actually obeyed the wishes of Banerjee''s boss and Trinamul supremo Mamata Banerjee and convened mass rallies only on Sundays.

While the CPI held one on December 29, the CPM rally is scheduled for January 12. However, they too see no reason why rallies and bandhs disrupting work and making the state lose millions, has anything to do with work culture. ""We would prefer a weekday since it is easier mobilising workers then because they are all at one place. On a holiday, they have the right to rest at home and do personal work,"" said CPI national council member Satya Bhattacharya.

7,Rules regarding govt land to be amended,"LUCKNOW: The cabinet on Thursday decided to amend rules regarding management of government land. This would facilitate regularisation of illegal possession of government and estate land and provide ownership rights to lease holders.

Moreover, different kinds of housing and agriculture lease holders would be able to get transferable and non-transferable ownership rights by depositing the prescribed fees to the government.

According to official sources, in 38 districts of Uttar Pradesh, there is about 22,703 acres of estate land whose management is governed by rules framed in 1987. There are 3178 cases pending in different courts regarding them.

The government has also decided that vacant estate land may be given at market rates to development authorities, housing boards or industrialdevelopment boards.

In case such land is not taken, then a system has been introduced to dispose of land on the basis of an open auction so that the government gets maximum revenue.

In another decision, the government has decided to notify the UP Handicapped Welfare Department Officer Gazetted Officersâ€™ Service Rules 2002 for removing flaws in recruitment and service rules.

A decision was also taken to exempt the film Amma from paying entertainment tax for a period of one year.

The cabinet also decided to provide trade tax exemption on edibles and other articles used by the poor like sattu, raal (material used in worship), chawari, choora and dhoona.

It was also decided that the settlement scheme for sugar being imported from outside the state should be implemented for tax assessment for 2001-2002 and 2002-2003. As a result, the settlement amount from each truck would be levied at the trade tax check posts in the following manner â€” Rs 2,700 for trucks loaded with sugar weighing between 12-15 tonne, Rs 4,500 on trucks loaded with sugar weighing between 15-30 tonne.

The one-time settlement scheme for brick kilns of the state in place of trade tax, had been introduced in 1988-1989. The cabinet decided to extend the settlement scheme to brick kiln owners for 2002-2003. The erstwhile State Electricity Board had taken loans for rural electrification, but these loans could not be repaid which affected the electrification process.

A decision was taken that the outstanding amount of REC, which was around Rs 1455.15 crore till 31 March 2002 would be repaid by the UP Power Corporation Ltd during a period of 20 years.

8,"No snap polls, says Mayawati","LUCKNOW: Chief minister Mayawati has reiterated that the Samajwadi Party which had unsuccessfully tried to topple her government, was indulging in a false publicity about the impending mid-term poll. Mayawati said that her government enjoyed a clear majority in the Vidhan Sabha and there was no question of any snap poll.

Mayawati said that the Samajwadi Party had made many efforts to destabilise the state government during the last two-three months. ""It also tried to allure the legislators and mislead the independent MLAs in believing that the government had lost its majority in the House,"" she said, adding ""When all attempts of the Samajwadi Party proved futile, it went on launching a propaganda that the chief minister was thinking of holding a mid-term poll.""

The chief minister said that the poll was held only last year and the government had no intention to throw the state into another mid-term poll. She said that the coalition government was formed with the sole idea of saving the state from another poll.

Since the Samajwadi Party was not interested in welfare of the people, it was spreading this kind of confusion, she said. The nefarious designs of the Samajwadi Party, she said, would never succeed.

9,Bickerings in Congress over support to govt,"PATNA: Even as the Congress high command has authorised senior party leader Manmohan Singh to talk to RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav in wake of the situation arising out of the killing of three youths in an allegedly fake police encounter in the Ashiana Nagar locality here, internal bickerings over the issue have surfaced in the party.

A section of partymen headed by MLCs Mahachandra Prasad Singh and Sheo Nandan Prasad Singh on Thursday demanded immediate withdrawal of the partyâ€™s support to the Rabri Devi government. Talking to mediapersons here on Thursday, the MLCs expressed displeasure over the partyâ€™s late reaction to the situation. â€œWhy did the party maintain silence during the last six days,â€� Mahachandra asked. He also appealed for a CBI probe into the incident. Mahachandra said BPCC president Shakeel Ahmed should be replaced. He further said that a party delegation would leave for Delhi this week to apprise the high command about the situation.

At a meeting convened on Thursday, the Congress Legislature Party (CLP) softened its stand towards the RJD regarding withdrawal of its support to the Rabri government. The meet chaired by CLP leader Vijay Shankar Dubey, who is also a minister in the Rabri government, demanded immediate suspension of the DSP posted at the Sachivalaya police station besides seeking institution of a criminal case against him. The meeting expressed concern over the deteriorating law and order situation in the state, particularly in Manjhaul, Bhagalpur and Sasaram.

It also reviewed the report of its fact-finding team on the â€œfakeâ€� encounter in Ashiana Nagar. The fact-finding team consisted of two senior party members Mahachandra Prasad Singh and Sheo Nandan Prasad Singh. In its report, the team had also demanded to pay an ex-gratia amount of Rs 10 lakh each to the dependents of the deceased.

â€œThe Congress will apprise the party high command about the situation in the state if the government fails to take immediate action against the guilty police personnel,â€� CLP leader Dubey told TNN. CLP leader Dubey, Sheo Nandan Prasad Singh, Mahachandra Prasad Singh and Dilkeshwar Ram met the family members of the victims at Ashiana Nagar.

10,Red alert sounded on bandh eve,"PATNA/DANAPUR/MUZAFFARPUR: Even as the state government has sounded a red alert, the Railway Board has decided to stop movement of trains in Bihar on Friday following intelligence inputs that â€˜anti-social elementsâ€™ may target railway installations and resort to stopping trains at various places during the Bihar bandh.

Prompted by the intelligence input, the state government has given charge of Government Railway Police to IG (weaker section) R L Kannaujia as ADG (railways) J K Sinha is on long leave. The National Democratic Alliance, CPI(ML), Lok Janshakti Party, Indian Federal Democratic Party, CPI and Bihar Peopleâ€™s Party have given the call for Bihar bandh to protest police brutality which led to the killing of three innocent youths in a fake encounter at Ashiana Nagar in Patna, and to demand the dismissal of Rabri Devi government which, the opposition charged, has become synonymous with collapse of law and order machinery.

Meanwhile, Patna Sadar SDO has imposed prohibitory orders under Section 144 of CrPC as a preventive measure to keep troublemakers at bay. The order would remain in force from 6 am to 12 midnight. The administration has also made several preventive arrests. Intelligence reports said that places such as Barh, Mokama, Patna, Ara, Purnia, Barauni, Muzaffarpur, Bettiah, Motihari, Mairwa (Siwan), Jehanabad and Sasaram had been the epicentre of such agitations in the past. The district administrations have been asked to ensure the safety of railway properties. They have been told that intelligence feedbacks must be promptly attended and adequate measures be taken to maintain law and order. DGP R R Prasad has directed all range police to assess the situation in their respective areas and accordingly take steps to ensure maintenance of law and order during the bandh.

The police will deal firmly with agitators this time, said a senior police official, adding that 400 Gorkha recruits will be put on job during the Bihar bandh. One company of Rapid Action Force has also been deployed in Patna. The officer said that unlike Patna bandh on December 31, 2002, the police will not remain a mute spectator to vandalism and deal sternly with arsonists. In order to deal with the situation, static deployment of securitymen was being made in all sensitive pockets in the state and special attention was being paid to protect vital installations, including property of the railways, state government offices, police stations and outposts, a police official said. Meanwhile, the railways have taken an unprecedented decision not to run any train in Bihar from 6 am to 6 pm in view of the bandh call.

As a result, the movement of all trains originating or passing through Bihar will come to a halt on Friday, said general manager of the East Central Railway (ECR) S C Gupta on Thursday. Talking to TNN, Gupta said that there were instances in the past when railway property was made a soft target of attack by bandh supporters. As such, the railways do not want to take any risk and jeopardise precious lives of passengers as well, he said. According to the ECR GM, the jurisdiction of four divisions â€” Danapur, Mughalsarai, Sonepur and Samastipur â€” falls in Bihar. Trains passing through these divisions will be stopped completely during the 12-hour bandh call, he said and added that several important long-distance trains will be regulated and detained at safe stations. He admitted that passengers will have to face great inconvenience due to it, but said passengersâ€™ safety is the major concern for the railways.

According to sources, this decision of the railways will affect the movement of over two dozen mail and express trains originating from the state to different places in the country. Similarly, an equal number of trains, either passing or terminating at different stations in the state, will be badly affected. Meanwhile, the Muzaffarpur adminisitration has ordered the closure of all colleges and university departments of BRA Bihar University on Friday as a precautionary measure. According to the acting DM Safeena A N, adequate number of police pickets have been set up at strategic points of the town. All central government institutions have been provided adequate security forces.

11,"Maya govt won't last long, feel bureaucrats","LUCKNOW: How long will the Mayawati-led BSP-BJP coalition government last? That is the question making the rounds both in political and bureaucratic circles here.

""Well, it is a matter of time and a lot depends on which of the two coalition partners blinks first,"" is how a senior bureaucrat sums up the present political scene in the state.

In a way, bureaucrats are like a weathercock and know all too well which way the wind is blowing. They are no soothsayers, but do indicate that the state is heading for political uncertainty sooner than expected. There is a growing impression that BJP and BSP are falling apart and that also the government is short of majority.

With that gloomy picture in the backdrop, there is a strong possibility of the House being dissolved before March 7 when its sitting becomes mandatory after a gap of six months from the last session. This way, Mayawati could be in office as a caretaker chief minister for six more months before polls.

The government does not seem to be comfortably placed. In a House of 401 (with two seats vacant-one due to resignation by Rajnath Singh following his election to Rajya Sabha and another due to the death of a Congress MLA), the government needs 201 seats for a majority.

As of now, the numbers are not there for the coalition government, particularly after the revolt by rebels and independents. Incidentally, the disqualification writs against them have been found to be prime facie admissible by Speaker, Keshari Nath Tripathi, who has fixed Jan 13 for final ruling on the issue. Even if the 10 BJP and one BSP rebels are not disqualified, the government cannot be sitting pretty. The voting pattern for the lone Vidhan Parishad seat held recently is indicative of the mood of the legislature.

The BJP-BSP and Lok Dal supported candidate, Munna got 194 votes as against that of 183 secured by Yashwant Singh, who was supported by the Samajwadi Party and other splinter groups of the opposition. Singh would have won if the 24 Congressmen had not abstained from voting.

But with the debacle in Gujarat, Congress is thinking anew. A coalition in Uttar Pradesh. Accordingly, the party has made its stand clear and will vote against the government if necessary and work for an alternative in the wake of its fall.

The situation, however, will arise only if the House is not dissolved. But those who know Mayawati well, she will never like to be replaced by her arch rival, Mulayam Singh Yadav with the support of the Congress, her new found enemy, she will prefer to dissolve the House.

12,Apcob asks Centre to reimburse farm loan interest,"HYDERABAD: Andhra Pradesh Cooperative Bank (APCOB) chairman T D Janardhan Rao asked the Centre to reimburse the interest on farm loans which was waived due to drought in the state.

Addressing a press conference on Wednesday, Janardhan Rao said the decision of the Centre to waive the loan would burden the cooperative banks. He said the waiver amount in the entire country would work out to Rs 800 crore and in Andhra Pradesh it would be around Rs 120 crore.

He said the waiver would affect the cooperative banks badly as more than 80 per cent of their loans were given to the agriculture sector. The interest rate charged by the Nabard to the cooperative banks should also be reduced in order to benefit the farmers. He added that the government should not tax the cooperative sector as recommend by the Kelkar Committee.

The APCOB chairman also announced a new loan scheme for small and marginal farmers to purchase land and a housing loan scheme to Dwacra groups.

He said the APCOB would launch a deposit mobilisation campaign from Jan. 1.

14,Muslim League minister sporting 'tilak' sparks row,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The apparently innocuous action of sporting a `tilak'' on his forehead during a visit to a Hindu Mutt has landed a Minister, belonging to Muslim League Kerala, in deep trouble with a Sunni outfit taking up cudgels against him for what it claimed an `un-Islamic'' act.

The state Local Administration minister Cherkalam Abdullah, during a recent visit to the Avala mutt in Kasargod district along with the Chief Minister A K Antony to meet Sringeri Sankaracharya Bharathithirtha Swamiji, had sported a `tilak'' inviting the wrath of Sunni Yuvajana Sangham (SYS) which raked up a controversy over the issue.

Terming the minister''s action as un-Islamic, SYS state President Panakkad Syed Umerali Shihab Thangal said it could invite religious and wanted the minister to offer repentance as per Islamic customs.

""Those who observe the customs of other religions are out of Islam. He should not enter mosques from now on,"" Thangal said. Rejecting the reported contention of the minister that he had not applied the `tilak'' on his own, the SYS leader said it was too serious an issue to be dismissed lightly.

Abdullah had told reporters at Malappuram Thursday that he had not applied the tilak on his own while evading further questions on the matter. The minister is likely to meet IUML supremo Panakkad Syed Mohammedali Shihab Thangal on Friday in the wake of the development, party sources said.

16,Radio paging industry gets fresh sops from govt,"NEW DELHI: In a major move to revive the ailing radio paging service industry, government on Friday night decided to waive license fees to the tune of Rs 450 crore and to switch over to revenue share mechanism.

The existing city and circle paging operators would be allowed to migrate from fixed licence fee regime to revenue share regime, Information and Broadcasting Minister Sushma Swaraj told reporters while briefing on the decisions taken at the cabinet meeting.

Under the new arrangement, the licence fee is proposed to be fixed at five per cent of the revenue, including the Universal Service Obligation (USO), she said.

However, the outstanding spectrum charges amounting to Rs 13 crore would not be waived, she said adding the move to shift to revenue share system would make the radio paging service affordable to lower income segment and make the industry viable.

Under the new regime, the amount outstanding would be paid within one month of the issue of demand letters from the date of migration to the proposed mechanism.

The Tariff Commission as well as Telecom Regulatory Authority of India had pointed out that the industry is not in good health and the pressure on its market would likely to continue in view of the competition from cellular mobile services, she said.

17,Two Sun Pharma employees arrested,"VADODARA: The Bharuch police have arrested two Sun Pharma employees in connection with the death of Dharmesh Vasava, a 22-year-old resident of Bharuch, who had volunteered for the bioequivalence'' tests that were conducted by Sun Pharma Advanced Research Centre (Sparc) here in Vadodara in August last year.

The two employees are Dr Jayashree Rao and Bhavesh Patel, who is a clinical research assistant, both associated with Sparc.

The two have been booked under IPC Sections 304 A, 337, 338 and 114 for negligence causing grievous complications.

The arrests were made four months after a police complaint was filed based on an FIR by Narendrasinh Vanjhara,who had also volunteered for the tests alongwith Vasava.

Vasava died in the Shiv Critical Care unit a few days after he had undergone tests at Narhari Arogya Kendra (Nak).

While Sun Pharma has denied that the tests were responsible for his death, Vasava''s relatives and Vanjhara who live in Bharuch said that Vasava developed swelling in his arms after he returned to Bharuch following the tests at Nak in Vadodara.

The tests were conducted on about 30 volunteers, most of who were enticed with money for volunteering for the tests.

They were admitted to the Nak where the ''bioequivalence tests'' were conducted by Sparc. According to Sparc''s spokesperson, the tests were conducted for research on a widely used antipsychotic drug Citalopram.

No other volunteer for the test had developed any side effects, he claimed.

However, the Bharuch judicial magistrate denied the bail application of the two accused for the second time here on Friday.

Bharuch PSI Pradeep Sarang said that the two arrests were made on Thursday afternoon after the Bharuch judicial magistrate denied the bail applications of the duo. ""We asked the two to come to Bharuch, as their bail was denied,"" he said.

At another hearing held here on Friday, the two were once again denied bail. Sun Pharma director Shailesh Desai told TNN that the arrests of their employees are a part of the normal criminal procedure. ""We have followed all norms in the bioequivalence tests and we also have the required permission to do so from all relevant authorities. We stand by our employees,"" he said.

According to him, the Sun Pharma now plans to approach the higher courts. ""We believe we have not done anything wrong, we therefore would now opt for legal remedies to resolve the problem,"" he said.

""This is a bailable offence and if our employees are not given bail we may contemplate approaching higher courts,"" he added.

The chief minister alleged that the attitude the central government was against Punjab which was showing no interest in lifting around three lakh tonnes sugar worth Rs 423 crores lying in the godowns of the state due to which the state government was unable clear the payment of Rs crore to the farmers lying pending with the government.

He further said that the central government was dumping more sugar here from the other states and within two months the stock of sugar in Punjab would piled up to five lakh MT.

24,Trinamul rally a costly winter circus: Panja,"KOLKATA: Dissident Trinamul Congress MP Ajit Panja called Mamata Banerjeeâ€™s January 6 Brigade Parade Ground rally in Kolkata the costliest circus of the year. However, he did not rule out the possibility of his returning to the party, if any overtures are made. At the same time, he also kept his options open about joining the Congress.

â€œI have information that Mamata is spending Rs 1.5 crore on the rally at the Brigade Parade Ground. There are many circuses held in Kolkata during the winter months. I can assure you that this is to be the costliest of them all,â€� Panja told reporters on Friday. According to him, the Trinamul - BJP combine would fail miserably in garnering popular support in the forthcoming panchayat polls. People will always recall what happened in the assembly elections. The Centre is paying no attention towards the development of West Bengal or north-eastern states.

No political party in West Bengal is taking up this issue. People will see through them,â€� Panja said. A furious Mamata refused to comment on Panjaâ€™s statements. â€œDonâ€™t expect me to react to such statements. Pankaj Banerjee will do the needful,â€� she told reporters. â€œHe criticises the party and then again talks about returning. Panja is a suspended member and one should not take him too seriously,â€� Banerjee said. About his return to the Congress, Panja said that he was still undecided.

â€œI appreciate the feelers sent out by Congress leaders but any positive proposal is yet come. Secondly, I am not sure who the greatest enemy for the Congress is in West Bengal. In Parliament, Congress and Left Front MPs walk out together over any issue. I am not sure whether the Congress is really serious about a fight against the Left Front in this state,â€� he said.

About his return to the Trinamul, Panja reiterated that Mamata was whimsical and he was yet to judge her intentions. â€œWe have no problems with returning to her but she will have to decide whether she really wants proper co-ordinated leadership,â€� he said. Panja protege Tapan Dasgupta claimed that Trinamul general secretary Mukul Roy had called him up, asking him to return to the party. â€œWe would still like to fight the CPM together. However, we would like to know why Ajit Panja was suspended.â€�

25,'Teaching and politics can go together',"KOLKATA: A schoolteacher in West Bengal may be punished under service rules for giving private tuition, but is free to neglect classes and attend a political rally. â€œWe cannot stop anybody taking part in active politics or be a party member. But business activity is strictly prohibited, including private tuition.

The district primary school councils have been assigned the task of punishing teachers if they are guilty of non-performance,â€� school education minister Kanti Biswas said here on Friday.

Punishment may go up to dismissal. â€œThe council can transfer, stop salary, suspend or permanently dismiss a teacher from service if the code of conduct is violated.â€� Biswas denied that many school teachers involved in active politics neglected their duties, despite the fact that teachers comprise the single largest professional group among the stateâ€™s MLAs.

â€œIt is possible to do justice to both fields,â€� he claimed. Guardians could complain against a negligent teacher to the district primary school councils and if not addressed, to the DM, he said. The system is transparent and we would like to know if there are still teachers who are not doing their duty,â€� he added.
