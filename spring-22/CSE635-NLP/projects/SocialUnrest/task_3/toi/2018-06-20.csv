0,Tyagi alleges humiliation: HC to hear govt today,"mumbai: former police commissioner ramdeo tyagi, facing arrest in a case of 1993 communal riots, on wednesday alleged before mumbai high court that he had been ""humiliated"" by authorities as they had filed fir against him eight years after the incident. urging for anticipatory bail, tyagi denied he had ordered cops to open fire at suleman bakery in which nine persons of minority community were killed and also refuted state government's allegation that he had gone there with policemen to kill members of the minority community. the special task force, set up after srikrishna commission of inquiry into 1992-93 communal riots submitted its report, had filed an fir on may 25 against tyagi and 16 policemen who opened fire at suleman bakery leading to the death of nine persons. fearing arrest, he moved the high court for bail. tyagi's lawyer, shirish gupte, submitted that shiv sena government and democratic front government had decided not to register any offence against his client in this case. on a plea made by government's counsel p r vakil, justice a b palkar directed tyagi to affirm in an affidavit his claim that the authorities had decided not to take any action against him. the court will on thursday hear government's counsel who has already opposed tyagi's bail on the ground that the entire responsibility of police firing fell on him because he had ordered the cops to do so in his capacity as the then joint commissioner of police.

1,Factional fight behind Bhopal violence,"bhopal: the communal outburst in the old areas of the city on tuesday afternoon, over certain dialogues and scenes in the hindi film gadar, was primarily the result of a struggle for supremacy between two factions of the local muslim community. highly placed sources in the state intelligence branch said the absconding bhopal youth congress president arif masood, who masterminded the arson and violence by inciting nearly 300 youths of his community, had for sometime been trying to usurp leadership from a local minister arif aqueel and former mp gufran azam. masood, he said, had also been trying to carve a separate niche for himself to prevent the control over the local muslim community being passed over to the students islamic movement of india (simi) which has been spreading its tentacles in madhya pradesh since 1998. ``masood wants the local fundamentalist elements to hitch their bandwagon with him rather than simi."" this, the sources argued, was largely because of the prevailing perception that simi, which champions jehad regardless of the sanctity of national boundaries, would not find favour with most indian muslims in the long run. this was probably why masood enjoyed the support of the local mufti. police sources said though simi had, by and large, not been involved in any major incidents so far, its influence had grown after the alleged burning of ``something like the koran"" by members of the vishwa hindu parishad in delhi last year. simi managed to take out protest rallies in dewas, burhanpur, and ujjain. simi, sources said, presently has units in 13 districts of mp, of which nine were active, the total membership being about 500. a conference was held in indore in november 2000, where inflammatory pamphlets and posters were circulated. thirty-nine cases, police sources said, had been registered against the organisation at bhopal, indore, ujjain, and khandwa, jabalpur, and narsinghpur under sections 153a, and 259a of the crpc till date. meanwhile, 28 arrests have been made in connection with tuesday's incident.

2,BJP suspects Samata hand in violence,"new delhi: the union government appeared to be in no mood to review its decision on the casefire extension outside nagaland, despite the violence in manipur, even as an nda member, the nipamacha singh-led manipur state congress party (n) which has one mla in the state assembly, withdrew support to the nda. the chaoba singh-led mscp(c), also an nda partner, which has 10 mlas, is also under pressure to pull out. sources stressed that the government's stance was owing to fact that the people's ``misgivings"" regarding its decision, leading to a greater nagaland, is confined only to manipur, even though there are naga-inhabited areas in assam, arunachal pradesh and tripura. there is also a suspicion in bjp circles that the samata party - which has been sore ever since bjp mlas voted against the koijam government - has something to do with the violence in the state. but despite suspicions, bjp leaders are unwilling to go on record on the subject. a senior party functionary, when asked to specify which parties he was referring to as being behind the present violence, chose to bypass the question. clearly, the bjp does not wish to annoy george fernandes or his 12-member samata party at this juncture. sources close to the prime minister said a meeting between vajpayee and fernandes was on the cards and though the pm had been monitoring the situation from his hospital bed in mumbai, it had been left to the home ministry to deal with the situation. at the party level, bjp general secretary sunil shastri, too, said there was no need to review the decision, and pointed out that the government had rushed forces to handle the violence in manipur. he added that while the people of the other northeastern states had understood the implications of the ceasefire, the people in manipur had become ``emotional and sentimental"". the samata party is keeping a low profile. while fernandes, who has said that all political parties in manipur were opposed to the ceasefire extension outside nagaland, when asked whether he would call a meeting of the nda, said on monday that decision would be taken after the prime minister returned to the capital. former samata party president jaya jaitley has refused to comment on the situation and the accusations levelled against the party, saying merely that the party had already articulated its opposition to the ceasefire extension. the samata is leaving the talking to former manipur chief minister radhabinod koijam, who is camping in the capital. on tuesday, he offered to resign from the state assembly, saying in a statement that he was ready to make any sacrifice if it would help protect the territorial integrity of the state. he also added that as chief minister he had not given consent to the extension of ceasefire to manipur, as was being hinted at by politicians opposed to him. meanwhile, the pm's emissary k padmanabhaiah, who negotiated the ceasefire agreement with the nscn(i-m) last week, had a 20-minute meeting with home minister l k advani. the situation in manipur and other north-eastern states was discussed in the meting. he, however, refused to say anything to journalists on the subject after the meeting. pm vajpayee - in answer to questions put to him in mumbai - repeated what the home minister has said on monday - that there was no question of altering the borders of manipur and that the violence had been triggered due to ``misgivings"".

5,Agha's protection from arrest extended,"new delhi: the interim protection against arrest granted to afghan national del agha, the alleged kingpin of a major smuggling racket using uzbek women as carriers, was extended by one month by the delhi high court on wednesday. justice o p dwivedi extended till july 20 the interim protection granted on may 21 during the hearing of agha's bail application on the ground that he has to attend to his seven-year-old daughter suffering from cancer. while extending the interim protection, the court said he would cooperate with the probe agencies. the order on his bail plea had been reserved by the court earlier. the cbi had earlier arrested uzbek national olga kozireva and some customs officials, who allegedly had helped in smuggling chinese goods, especially silk worth several crores of rupees, into the country. olga, however, was granted bail by a lower court last week but she could not be released from jail as she continued to be in detention under cofeposa. directorate of revenue intelligence in its report had alleged agha was the kingpin of a smuggling chain in which uzbek women, including olga, were used as carriers. cbi had maintained that investigation into the case was still going on and it would take some time to be completed. cbi counsel had earlier told the court that agha was cooperating with it in the probe. cbi had last month arrested customs officials, s sharma, n zutshi and v k khurana, after agha's interrogation.

6,Illegal gold unit owners protest against BMC action,"mumbai: the brihanmumbai municipal corporation's (bmc) crackdown on illegal gold ornament units in bhuleshwar has angered owners and workers in the industry who say the closures endanger the livelihood of the two-lakh labour force. the corporation began taking action on the small informal units after a major fire in a workshop killed 24 workers in populwadi on may 31. the tragedy had bared the hazardous living and working conditions of the semi-skilled, largely-bengali labour force, and angered local residents, who had been complaining frequently of the fire hazards posed by such units in the narrow bylanes of bhuleswar. in response, the bmc raided units for illegal cylinders and unauthorised extensions and closed several units which were without the requisite permits. however, owners allege that they are being unfairly targeted and the closures are arbitrary and unauthorised. ``since the accident, the corporation has been issuing notices indiscriminately, even to those who have licences or those who follow the norms, '' says rameshchand malandkar, general secretary of the yuva sangharsh vahir, which represents the owners. ``worse, they do not give notice, but land up with circulars in english, and begin demolishing furniture before we can respond.'' owners claim that 75 per cent of several thousand units have closed since the tragedy, either by the corporation or voluntarily, jeopardising the livelihood of the workforce. ``if it is a question of unauthorised commercial establishments in residential buildings, the whole area, even city, is full of them,'' says sameer guin of the bengali association. the association has petitioned the commissioner, the chief minister and even called on the west bengal chief minister to look into the matter. however, municipal officials say all action has been preceded by a proper survey. ``we have taken action in around 2,000 cases, including seizures, demolition of illegal extensions and chimneys, and prosecution of owners,'' says deputy municipal commissioner v patankar. ``most proprietors have locked their premises and run away, while when we do take action we are obstructed by hundreds of workers and owners.'' the raids are supposed to be carried out by an action team composed of municipal officials, residents and owners. however, owners claim they are not represented. mr patankar says that the main problem is that while many of the units are indeed registered under the shops and establishment act, they are really supposed to have a licence under the factories act. unionists point out that like many other small scale units in the city, most owners do not bother to apply for such licenses since they know they will be rejected since they can not fulfil its requirements, which include minimum space, wages and conditions of work. ``we accept that many of the units are functioning irregularly. but what about municipal officers who have been pocketing money and ignoring the situation for decades ? '' mr malandkar asks. he displays rent receipts which clearly show that the bmc is aware of the existence of both residential and commercial rooms in the same building. ``in some cases,'' claim owners, ``buildings have been converted into commercial premises officially but residences are overlooked.'' owners say they want the bmc to withdraw the cases on the grounds that they will abide by several safety precautions and labour rules such as having only eight people in a 100 square metre room, using only licensed gas cylinders and getting clearances from the fire brigade and abiding by pollution norms. the owners say they will also follow restricted work timings. as the timing of the bhuleshwar incident--7 am--showed, workers laboured from early in the morning to well into the night. mr patankar points out that as recently as december 2000, the owners had agreed to a code of conduct in a meeting with the bmc. ``but they did not abide by the code,'' he says. however, he acknowledges that dealing with the gold ornament industry, which has been flourishing in this residential pocket for 100 years, is a sensitive, difficult task. ``we are sandwiched between the demands of the residents and the plight of the workers,'' he says.

11,Weak monsoon dampens farmers' spirit,"gadag: the monsoon, described as ""weak"" by experts this year, has fazed the farmers of nargund taluk in the district as it would severely affect tilling and sowing of seeds. scanty rainfall in the pre-monsoon days has dipped the water level in the malaprabha reservoir, the source for irrigation in the district. and any prospect of cultivating cotton, the major crop in the region, is getting eclipsed. driven up the wall by the vagaries of nature, the farmers are seeing the hobson's choice in maize, the crop that brought more nightmares than dividends last year. the bleak scenario haunting the district can be understood from the rainfall nargund taluk has received: 5.08 cm, which is a mere 10 per cent of the average rainfall in may. what is worse, the rainfall is showing no signs of improvement in june, a harsh reality the farmers have been inured to in the last one decade. to bail out the distressed farmers, the agriculture officers of the district are advising them to cultivate chillie, onion and green gram crops. but the dilemma of the farmers seems to have no answer in such lofty suggestions. for, without rain, there is no cultivation. the only oasis in this desert of frustration is the mahadayi project, which, once executed, provides the farmers a rich benefit from rivers malaprabha and mahadayi. with tilling of land set to begin in july-end, the farmers have decided to bank on something that is sure to pay off: short-term crops as against long-term ones.

13,"PCB workers on strike, demand Sena leader's arrest","pune: employees of the pune cantonment board (pcb), irked by the unruly behaviour of some shiv sainiks who threw cow dung on the face of an official on june 19 while protesting against the inordinate delay in clearing garbage from the kumbhar bawdi area, went on a flash strike on wednesday demanding arrest of laxmikant bulbule, shakha pramukh of ward 4. nearly 100 people, led by mr bulbule, had forced their way into the office of pcb health superintendent v.s. kulkarni on june 19 to lodge a complaint against the stinking garbage heap lying unattended for days together. irked by the indifferent attitude of the pcb health department towards garbage collection, members of the delegation had a heated argument with mr kulkarni. in the ensuing melee, irate sainiks reportedly threw cow dung and garbage on the face of mr kulkarni. agitated by the high-handed behaviour of the shiv sena supporters, pcb employees struck work till 11.30 a.m. on wednesday. they resumed work only after cantonment executive officer j.s. mahi said the police officials had assured him that they would arrest mr bulbule within 24 hours. but mr bulbule, in a statement released on wednesday, said that, he along with his supporters, had courted arrest at the wanowrie police station. the police had registered a case against the shiv sena members under sections 143,147,148, 352, 353 and 452 of the ipc for causing damage to public property. however, all the accused were released on bail by the judicial magistrate first class (jmfc) t.v. barse later on wednesday. the court bail notwithstanding, the pcb has charged that mr bulbule is a hooligan who has been extorting money from hand-cart owners and other roadside vendors in kumbhar bawdi market. the pcb statement categorically alleges that mr bulbule's act of vandalism was an indirect way of stalling the anti-encroachment drive launched against illegal hawkers in the market.

14,Stress and suicide: GenNext under too much pressure?,"pune: on tuesday, three students were rushed to hospital because they displayed symptoms of acute reaction to stress after learning that they had failed in the ssc examination. one student in dehu road committed suicide, while another tried to end her life. in mumbai, four students are recovering in hospital after similar suicide attempts. when childhood years -- supposed to be the most untroubled years of our lives -- are turning out to be so traumatic, one must ask just what is going on. experts, counsellors and psychiatrists feel that there is a message in these incidents of stress. dr usha khire, secretary of the jnana prabodhini research institute, says that students and parents do not know how to adjust to success or failure. ""we have no patience, we are obsessed with speed, possess an unrealistic image of our self and generally have forgotten the importance of tolerance and endurance,"" she observes. her close interaction with students has revealed that even the bright and intelligent among them find it difficult to come to terms with marks that are below their expectations. it's important that society accept that ""academic excellence is not the be-all and end-all of life; there are other options that can make a person successful. parents and children have got the wrong notion that failure in the ssc examination means one is not good for anything,"" dr khire emphasises. suchitra date, counsellor at the muktangan english school, puts the blame squarely on parents. ""parents themselves are disoriented. they don't know why and for what they set certain targets for their kids. often i find that parents suddenly put a stop to all extra-curricular and sports activities as soon as their wards go into the ninth standard! this affects their self confidence,"" she states. peer pressure is another culprit. ""i have found that ssc students often get depressed after appearing for the examination because this is the time when they discuss among themselves where each one stands and where to get admission. if a youngster does not get admission to the same college as her friends, she feels she is not good enough,"" ms date says. schools too can be at fault. psychiatrist dr ulhas luktuke finds that many schools nowadays do not fail students but keep on promoting them to the next standard. ""by the time they reach the ssc stage, the children do not know the taste of failure or how to cope with it. so, if the student fails in the ssc exam, on which so much importance is placed, the student is bound to feel disoriented,"" he explains. ""our society as a whole attaches too much importance to excelling in formal education. consequently, failure here is construed as incompetence, which damages self-esteem,"" dr luktuke says. he insists that students must be taught the meaning of failure. ""we must realise that exam failure is just a hurdle and not the end. failure or success in exams does not negate or certify one's intelligence. it is just one of the skills that is required to become a successful individual."" obviously, our knowledge-free education system, where tuition classes are the rule and not the exception, requires a thorough overhaul. otherwise, year after year, the good news of youngsters topping the merit list will be offset by the tragic news of those whose failure to make it has led to unfortunate consequences. call for help students who have not performed well or have failed in the ssc examination and want to share their feelings with a neutral observer can contact childline on phone number 1098. dr anuradha sahasrabuddhe, who manages the 24-hour helpline, has appealed to students not to take any extreme steps but talk to the counsellors and social workers who man the helpline for guidance.

19,Yet another minister delays flight,"lucknow: after mamata banerjee and sharad yadav, it was the turn of ram vilas paswan to influence delay of a domestic flight at amausi airport on wednesday evening. the flight was held back for an hour to fly the telecommunication minister to delhi but was forced to take off without the vip after the other passengers hauled up the airlines staff. the incident took place when the indian airlines flight (ic 805) was to take off for delhi at its schedule departure time of 5:20 pm. it was only after the aircraft, with nearly 150 passengers on board, did not leave the tarmac for another 15 minutes after the schedule departure, that the passengers made enquiries from the crew members on board. what added to the anger of the passengers was the news that the flight had been held back as the telecommunication minister ram vilas paswan was to take the same flight but couldn't make it on time. a khadi-clad tall youth, later identified as pradeep misra said to be a lieutenant of the minister who had already checked in at the airport, came in strong support of paswan and allegedly threatened the crew not to take off. the situation took a turn for the worse when infuriated passengers again got down from the aircraft and thronged the departure lounge at the terminal. the airlines officials, who tried to pacify them, had a tough time as the irate passengers sought an explanation on why the flight was being held up. interestingly, when the fiasco was in full swing, it was learnt that the helicopter carrying paswan from fatehpur was yet to take off. the news that it would take atleast another half an hour for paswan to land at amausi and then board the flight, added fuel to the fire as passengers virtually went berserk. making the situation grim was misra who by now alighted and stood on the tarmac threatening to obstruct the movement of the aircraft if the crew dared to take off. he had to be removed by the security personnel from the scene. finally, the passengers had their way and the flight took off at 6:16 pm, nearly an hour late. as the plane readied for taxiing, paswan along with a personal security officer (pso) entered the terminal hurriedly but opted to stay back. the three then left the airport in a huff.

20,"Societies, not farmers benefit from FCI relaxation","sasaram: thanks to the relaxation given by the food corporation of india in the specification of quality for purchase of paddy and rice, some primary agriculture co-operative societies (pacs), rice mill owners and middleman - and not the farmers - have become richer by lakhs of rupees. the fci, it may be mentioned here, was initially reluctant to procure the rice and paddy produced by the farmers of the rohtas and kaimur districts on minimum basic support price on the plea of the grains being of substandard quality. however, the farmers and different political parties launched massive agitations against the fci refusal in december and january last. in the kaimur district, water resources minister jagadanand led the agitation whereas in the rohtas district, samata party mla akhlaq ahmad took the leadership in his hands. on december 29, 2000, the agitating farmers shouted slogans against local bjp mp and union minister of state muni lal in the presence of the then defence minister george fernandes, who was here to unveil the statue of the late jagjivan ram. the agitators also forced the local mp to stop his speech midway. sensing the mood of the agitating farmers, fernandes had assured them that he would take up the matter with the prime minister. the issue rocked parliament and state assembly also. subsequently, the fci conceded some relaxation in the specification of quality for procuring the grains and, thereafter, procured paddy and rice worth rs 4 crore. but the benefit, which was offered to the farmers by the government, has been pocketed by some pacs, rice mill-owners and big farmers. the fci procured about 9,000 metric tonnes of paddy and rice worth about rs 4 crore in the rohtas and kaimur districts alone. the sources said that the pacs, through which the fci procured the rice and paddy, purchased the rice from the open market at the rate of rs 675-700 a quintal and supplied the same to the fci at the rate of rs 846 per quintal. sources in the fci also said that most of the rice mill-owners stopped to sell their rice in open market and, instead, supplied it to the fci purchasing centre because the difference between the rate of open market and the procurement rate was of about rs 150 per quintal. ""the agitations notwithstanding, the local farmers failed to get minimum support price."" rued the bjp mla from nokha and demanded a high level inquiry into the matter. incidentally, there are 354 pacs in the district but the fci procured the paddy and rice only through few of them. the sources said that most of the pacs in the district were running on paper and were in fact pocket organisations of some influential persons. nagendra rai of karahagar said his rice was not procured by the purchasing centre at sasaram and he was advised to come through pacs only. but that is what happened in the past. even now, the fci purchasing centres in the kaimur and rohtas districts are allegedly giving preference to the same pacs for procurement of wheat. the wheat of the farmers are being rejected describing it as sub-standard but the same wheat is procured through the pacs. in open market, the rate of wheat is rs 490-500 per quintal whereas the fci rate is rs 610 per quintal. when contacted, district supply officer manik chandra lakda expressed his inability to comment on the issue, pleading the matter involved the district co-operative officer (dco). the office of the dco denied the charge. the fci district manager based at gaya, under whose jurisdiction the rohtas and kaimur districts fall, when contacted on phone, advised this correspondent to contact the fci officer at sasaram for details regarding how much paddy and rice had been purchased from farmers. the local officer, however, said that the office had not compiled the figures. meanwhile, bjp leader sudhir kumar singh has demanded a high level inquiry into the whole matter.
