0,Rabri govt a failure: BJP leader,"PATNA: Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Bihar unit, spokesperson Kiran Ghai has expressed concern over the escape of prisoners from the Katihar jail and the clash between two groups of prisoners in the Jehanabad sub-divisional jail. She said these are the examples of Rabri government's administrative failures. In a press statement issued here on Thursday, Ghai asked how can a government, which can not control few hundred prisoners, rule over the whole state.Referring to the Chapra jail incident where prisoners had taken over the command of the jail for four days, she said despite increase in the number of such incidents the state government has not taken any step to improve the condition of jails. She further said jails in Bihar have become control rooms for the criminal activities. On the one hand, facilities like TV and cell phones are made available to influential prisoners and on the other hand, third grade treatment is meted out to ordinary prisoners, she said.The BJP spokesperson alleged the involvement of jail administration in such incidents. If such items are found in possession of inmates, one can well imagine that some jail officials are conniving with the inmates. She said during raids in some jails of the state, a large number of inmates were found to be possessing objectionable items, like wine, arms and mobile phones.Ghai said immediate steps should be taken to avoid any such incident in future.She also said that immediate action should be taken against the guilty officials.The official concerned should be dismissed or transferred, she said.She said that the government should initiate immediate steps to arrest the prisoners who escaped from jails.

1,RJD to campaign against quota policy from Friday,"DHANBAD: RJD would launch a weeklong statewide mass awareness campaign against the quota policy of the Jharkhand government from Friday. Giving this information, Jharkhand state RJD president Aklu Ram Mahto alleged that faulty quota policy of the Marandi government has created tension in the state. He was addressing a press conference here on Thursday. Demanding quota for backward community on population basis, the RJD leader alleged that the Jharkhand government was dividing the people on caste lines for political benefit. Earlier the government had declared 73 per cent quota in the state against the provisions of the constitution without preparing ground for its decision. When the court interfered the government fixed the quota at 50 per cent in a haste without consulting other political parties, he alleged and said that population of backward community was ignored while deciding the quota. Similarly, there is no provision for reservation for women and the handicapped in the quota policy announced by the government, he added.Castigating the government for unnecessarily arousing the passion of the public in the name of domicile policy, Mahto said a case should be lodged against the chief minister for the killing of youths in pro and anti-domicile stirs. This is also a form of extremism and the chief minister should be booked under POTA, he opined.

2,Central agricultural team to visit Pune on Friday,"PUNE: A five-member central team will tour Pune on Friday to assess the loss in kharif crop yield following the dry spell in July, which had forced the state to declare a drought-like situation.

The visit of the central team, headed by joint secretary in the agriculture ministry, Satish Chandra, will also review the relief work taken up by the state government under the employment guarantee scheme (EGS).

The visit of the central team to the drought-affected talukas in Pune division assumes significance as the state has declared the crop yield in this region as less than 50 per cent of average returns. The adversely-affected talukas in Pune include Purandar, Baramati, Indapur, Daund and Shirur.

Several talukas in Satara and Sangli districts have also been badly affected. Speaking to TNN, divisional commissioner of Pune, Umeshchandra Sarangi, confirmed the visit of the central team to Purandar taluka in Pune district, and Khatav and Maan talukas in Satara.

""The team will go to three places in Purandar taluka, which received extremely poor rainfall in July and again in September too,"" he said.

Sarangi said all four affected talukas not only had a dry spell in July, but also a long absence of rains in September which, apparently, affected the crop yield. Sources in the commissionerate said these talukas in Pune had received just 35 per cent of the average expected rainfall.

Analysing the situation, a senior official in the commissioner''s office said the scarcity in July delayed the sowing of almost all kharif crops. Although the region did receive satisfactory rains in August, the nutrients required by the crops for good yield was inadequate, sources said. The bad spell in September practically stunted the growth of the crops during the maturity stage as there was not enough moisture in the soil.

Asked for his reaction to the situation, Sarangi only said it was a mixed scenario where certain talukas were adversely affected, while others got respite in August. He refused to spell out the amount of central aid for Pune.

The central agricultural team is also scheduled to visit talukas in the Aurangabad district. During their inspection, the central team members will also check the drinking water availability and fodder for animals, the sources said.

After their visit to talukas in Pune and Satara districts, the team will leave for Mumbai to meet C M Lal, principal secretary of the revenue and rehabilitation department, for further talks on the drought-like situation faced by farmers in the state due to a dry spell in July and September.

3,Intelligence alert over arrest of Myanmarese at Netaji airport,"KOLKATA: Detention of a Myanmarese national at the Netaji Subhas international airport sent the intelligence agencies into a tizzy on Thursday.

Ziaw Min (25) was apprehended by immigration officers at Netaji Subhas International airport at Dum Dum just before he was to board IC 727. â€œHe had a ticket to Rangoon with him,â€� a senior immigration officer said.

According to intelligence sources, the arrest assumes significance, because a few days ago, another Myanmarese youth was held for his alleged connection with a Pakistan-based terrorist outfit.

â€œHowever, nothing can be conclusively said right now,â€� sources said.

Abu Fazi alias Fazle Rehman was arrested at the Sealdah station on October 8. CID sources said Fazle was a Myanmarese national who lived on the Bangla-Myanmar border in Chittagaon district.

Police said Ziaw Minâ€™s visa had expired, yet he could not give any satisfactory explanation as to why he had over-stayed in India.

Secondly, the local address he had given was that of Ahmedabad, which he never visited during his stay in India. He could not give a satisfactory reply as to why he had given a wrong address.

After he was grilled for over two hours, he revealed that he had never visited Ahmedabad. But he clandestinely went to Saharanpur in Uttar Pradesh. His movement in the country was bound to evoke suspicion. Preliminary investigation revealed that Min visited several places in Uttar Pradesh. â€œWe are yet to know the purpose of his travel,â€� police said.

The police are facing trouble interrogating him as Min does not know Indian languages very well. â€œHe could only speak in broken Hindi,â€� an immigration officer said.

4,Hajipur jail inmates on hunger strike to protest mistreatment,"HAJIPUR: Twenty four prisoners of Hajipur divisional jail went on an indefinite hunger strike over the alleged â€œrudeâ€� treatment meted out to some fellow inmates by the jail authorities, police said on Thursday.

Sub-divisional police officer, Vaishali, Z Ahmed said that the prisoners went hunger strike on Wednesday in protest of the â€œmisbehaviourâ€� of the jail authorities with a few inmates following their confrontation with the compounder of the jail hospital on Tuesday last.

The prisoners had assaulted the compounder allegedly for neglecting a sick inmate, Ahmed said. After the fight, the jail staff thrashed a few inmates and put them chains, he said.

The agitating prisoners had turned down the district administrationâ€™s request end the strike and another round of talks would be held later on Thursday.

5,Foul play in development plan alleged,"PUNE: In a serious allegation, BJP corporator Ujwal Keskar has accused the civic administration of deleting the reservation of 2,410 hectares as a hill-top hillslope zone, in contradiction of the draft development plan (DP) for the city''s 23 fringe villages.

He has threatened to move the high court if the Pune municipal corporation (PMC) throws open the said zone for residential development. Speaking to reporters here on Thursday, Keskar, who is also vice-chairman of the city improvement committee (CIC), claimed a state minister had reportedly pressurised the city engineer''s office to delete these proposed reservations.

While refusing to comment on the allegation, city engineer V G Dhadphale said, ""We are yet to finalise the draft DP. The reservations we plan to earmark in the DP are strictly confidential. If Keskar has any objections, he should raise them after we table the draft DP for approval before the CIC meeting.""

Elaborating on the issue, Keskar pointed out that two years ago, the PMC had awarded a contract to India International Infrastructure Engineering (IIIT) Limited to prepare the draft of the DP for the 38 fringe villages (merged with PMC areas in 1997).

The company obtained satellite images of the land falling in these villages and also conducted a land-use survey. Based on these reports, the company planners identified over 3,500 hectares of land in 38 villages which they felt should be strictly reserved as hill-top hill-slope zones.

However, after the draft was finalised in November 2000, the state government issued an order to de-link 15 of the villages fully, and five partially, from corporation limits. The PMC was therefore required to redraft the DP for 23 villages. The PMC resolved that a fresh DP be prepared by city engineer V G Dhadphale as IIIT had already collected the required data.

Keskar said that as per the IIIT survey report, the hill-top hill-slope zone in these 23 villages measures 2,410 hectares. However, now the administration has decided not to honour the IIT reports and stick to the regional plan (RP), according to which, only 500 hectares of land in these 23 villages can termed a hill-top hill-slope zone, he alleged.

6,Bal Thackeray's arrest unlikely soon,"MUMBAI: Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray may not be arrested in the near future despite the Shivaji Park police registering a case against him on Wednesday night for allegedly inciting communal disharmony in his speech at the Sena''s Dussehra rally.

Mr Thackeray''s allegedly provocative outbursts and remarks against Muslims at the rally on Tuesday had attracted the provisions of Section 153 and 153 (A) of the Indian Penal Code which deal with the offence of promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, language and race.

An audio-recording of Mr Thackeray''s speech was being sent to Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee, deputy chief minister Chhagan Bhujbal said at a press conference at Mantralaya on Thursday. Mr Thackeray had ridiculed Mr Vajpayee''s handling of Pakistan-sponsored terrorism. Observers said that by sending the tape to Mr Vajpayee, Mr Bhujbal was shrewdly trying to create a rift between two saffron allies, the BJP and the Sena.

Moreover, with the Congress leadership in New Delhi also demanding action against Mr Thackeray for his utterances, Mr Bhujbal appears to have ensured support for his actions against alleged communal forces.

The Congress gameplan is aimed at consolidating the minority vote-bank in the states of Delhi, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh which will go to the polls shortly.

Asked what the objectionable remarks made by Mr Thackeray were, Mr Bhujbal said, ""I have not heard the tapes. The police have taken suo motu action against him. I gave no instructions. It was a political speech in which he wanted to make an impression on the people that more than the BJP, the RSS or the Bajrang Dal, it was he who is now the leader of the Hindutva cause.""

7,Troop pullback will cost the govt crores,"NEW DELHI: The pullback of over four lakh troops along with heavy armoured and artillery formations from forward positions along the International Border (IB) with Pakistan will be an enormous logistical exercise, with costs running into hundreds of crores of rupees.

But the decision of the Cabinet Committee on Security to ""redeploy"" forward deployed forces, feel Army officers, has come not a day too soon. ""You can''t leave troops hanging on the border in combat readiness for 10 months. It''s criminal that a decision was not taken, one way or the other, sooner,"" said one.

In the initial days after Operation Parakram, which began in the wake of the December 13 Parliament attack, the mobilised troops were all gung-ho about ""going in to teach a lesson"".

""But their morale started ebbing once the realisation sunk in that the promised engagement would probably not take place. Moreover, the harsh weather and terrain took a heavy toll on both the men and their equipment,"" said another officer.

The general feeling, with of course some hindsight, is that the mobilisation of more than a half-a-million troops should not have been a ""knee-jerk reaction"" in the first instance itself. ""It should have been a calibrated build-up,"" said the officer.

Be that as it may, the top brass of the armed forces held a series of meetings on Thursday to chalk out the withdrawal from the IB. The ""demobilisation"" is likely to begin from Punjab, followed by Rajasthan, Gujarat and the Jammu sector. The combined commanders'' conference on October 23 is likely to fine-tune these plans.

The pullback is certainly going to cost a lot, with hundreds of trains and aircraft being requisitioned, but the government is extremely cagey about disclosing any figures. The cost, as per some estimates, for just the initial mobilisation ran well over Rs 2,000 crore. While it took 28 days for the initial mobilisation, the pullback is expected to take slightly longer.

""Though several formations are already in the process of being withdrawn, it must be remembered that the initial mobilisation was conducted as a national emergency on a war footing,"" said a defence ministry official.

Take, for instance, just the Army''s three principal offensive formations: 1 Corps, 2 Corps and 21 Corps, based in Mathura, Ambala and Bhopal in normal circumstances. Built around a nucleus of an armoured division and two infantry divisions, each of these strike formations also has artillery, engineer and air defence brigades.

""It will take more than 50 trains, with specialised heavy trailers, as ''rolling stock'' to move back each of these corps which have heavy equipment like tanks, artillery and air defence guns, heavy bridging material,"" said an officer.

8,BJP meet to discuss political scenario,"MUMBAI: The defeat of BJP and its NDA ally National Conference in the recent Jammu and Kashmir elections will come up for review at the four-day meeting of central office bearers of BJP beginning here on Saturday.

The meeting, to be chaired by party President Venkaiah Naidu, would also discuss the developments in Uttar Pradesh following the Cabinet expansion in the state where the BJP is in alliance with Bahujan Samaj Party, party sources said.

The fallout of the attack on Akashardham Temple in Gujarat as also the broad features of the strategy for the forthcoming assembly elections there would be discussed, they said.

The Gaurav Yatra being undertaken by Chief Minister Narendra Modi would also come up for discussion, the sources said.

The ongoing Gaon Chalo Abhiyan of the party president would be reviewed as also the party''s membership drive.

The change of leadership in state units especially in Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Chattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and its impact on them is also likely to figure, they said.

A meeting of Maharasthra zilla parishads is scheduled for Sunday, where various aspects of the party''s functioning at lower levels would be discussed, the sources said.

After the five zonal meetings, this was an exercise to mobilise the party cadres for the Lok Sabha elections due in 2004, they said.

""We want to mobilise the cadres as our aim is to get a clear majority on our own in the next Lok Sabha elections. It is with this in view that such meetings are being held regularly,"" the sources said.

9,Former CSE Vice-President K K Daga arrested,"KOLKATA: Former vice-president of the Calcutta Stock Exchange K K Daga was on Friday arrested in connection with the Rs 120 crore scam at the bourse in 2001.

Police sources said Daga, who was vice-president of the bourse in 2000-01 when the payment crisis surfaced, was arrested after being interrogated for the past couple of days.

It was alleged that Daga had either ignored or did not forward some of the information provided by IndusInd Bank in connection with the dishonour of a cheque for Rs 25 crore issued by one of the accused in the scam in favour of the exchange.

The delay in reaching the information to proper authorities proved costly to the bourse as it could not switch off the trading terminals of these brokers, which subsequently led to a larger default of Rs 150 crore.

10,PDP hopeful of govt formation soon,"SRINAGAR: Terming the imposition of governor''s rule in Jammu and Kashmir as an ""expected"" move, two senior PDP leaders on Friday expressed the hope that a government would be in place in the next few days.

""There is every hope that political parties will realise their responsibility and, respecting the verdict of the people, forge a political formation during the next couple of days and form a government,"" PDP Vice-President Muzaffar Hussain Beig said.

Another top PDP leader Ghulam Hassan Mir said, ""political parties will join hands, sink their differences and chalk out a common minimum programme.""

He hoped the governor''s rule would not extend beyond one week.

Reacting to the imposition of the governor''s rule, Baig said, ""It was expected. There was nothing surprising about it.""

""It was anticipated that Farooq Abdullah would not agree to continue as caretaker chief minister, thus leaving the governor with no choice even though he had clearly indicated that he would wait for parties to show their majority by October 21,"" Baig said.

He said the development may cause disappointment among the people who may apprehend that governor''s rule may continue for six months.

11,Onus on PDP to break political impasse: Cong,"SRINAGAR: The Congress on Friday said the onus to end the political impasse in Jammu and Kashmir lied with the People''s Democratic Party, led by Mufi Mohammed Sayeed, by allowing PCC chief Ghulam Nabi Azad to lead a coalition government.

""The imposition of Governor''s rule in the state is temporary and the extension till Oct 21 given to political parties to try and form a government still holds and now the onus to end the impasse lies with PDP,"" senior Congress leader Saifuddin Soz said here.

Soz said the best course was that Azad lead the government in the state and PDP participate in it actively.

""PDP will have a position equal to that of Congress -- almost -- in the possible government and we will try to work on a mutually agreed agenda in the larger public interest,"" he said addressing the apprehensions of PDP that it would be unable to fulfill its electoral promises if it did not get the top slot. ""There will be a sense of achievement for PDP also,"" Soz said.

Explaining Congress'' insistence on having its candidate in the CM''s chair, Soz said the party had given a secular image to Jammu by defeating ""communal forces"" like BJP in the region. ""That achievement cannot be altogether ignored,"" he said.

Soz also acknowledged PDP''s performance in the elections in which it defeated important leaders of National Conference in the Kashmir valley.

Asked about certain features of PDP''s manifesto, like a call for repealing Pota in the state and disbanding the Special Operations Group of local police, believed to be a stumbling block in an alliance between PDP and Congress, Soz said these can be worked out later.

12,Disinvestment programme has lost focus: Jaswant,"NEW DELHI: Admitting that the government ""lost focus"" on the disinvestment programme, Finance Minister Jaswant Singh on Friday asserted there was no rethinking on the issue and the government will go ahead with it.

""The discussions (on disinvestment) issue wandered a bit and we lost focus. But there is no illusion in government''s mind, no deviation from purpose. The government will disinvest,"" Singh said while addressing the inaugural meeting of the Board of India Today Economists.

Singh, however, clarified that in the process of disinvestment, the government will seek to address all the relevant questions raised.

He, however said he was not in a position to reduce agriculture subsidy and pointed out that US, China and countries in the Western Europe have subsidies of around $1 billion.

""In the face of all this when as a non-economist I am told subsidy is bad and should be abandoned, I am left very confused"", he told the gathering.

13,2 firms await govt nod for DTH services,"NEW DELHI: Nearly two years after the government gave its nod, direct-to-home television services may soon become a reality with two companies - Space TV and ASC Enterprises - awaiting clearance of their applications.

""We have received applications from the two companies and these are undergoing the clearances from the Ministry of Home Affairs, Finance Ministry and others,"" Information and Broadcasting Minister Sushma Swaraj told reporters on Friday.

She said the proposals were received under the existing guidelines despite demands that they should be changed by raising the FDI component from 20 per cent.

Swaraj said her ministry has rejected the recommendation of the N K Singh Steering Group on FDI to raise the FDI limit from 20 per cent to 49 per cent.

She said this was done as at present the DTH guidelines stipulated 49 per cent cap in foreign equity, including 20 per cent FDI and 29 per cent NRI, OCB and FII investment, and accepting the recommendations would mean raising the foreign investment to nearly 80 per cent.

The Group had said that given the current 20 per cent FDI limit, foreign companies have little or no interest in entering this sector and this limit should be raised to 49 per cent so that foreign companies can enter.

14,"After three years, DF govt has little to boast about","MUMBAI: After three years in the office, the Democratic Front (DF) government has little to show by way of performance, say political observers.

While the DF spent its first year at the helm blaming the previous Shiv Sena-BJP regime for its misrule, the second year was utilised to telling the people how difficult it was to get things done in a coalition dispensation. Now, the government is admitting that it has little to show in terms of performance.

Deputy chief minister Chhagan Bhujbal, who belongs to the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), recently confessed that his government''s performance was ""not satisfactory"".

He, however, promised to deliver in the remaining two years.

The government plans to clean up the financial mess, effect a dramatic industrial and agricultural recovery and go back to the voter in a better shape of conscience after two years.

""However, it is not clear how it plans to achieve all these,"" a Mantralaya official observed.

Officials stated that a sea route from Versova to Nariman Point, a skybus project for suburban Mumbai and flyovers connecting the eastern and western suburbs were among the high-profile projects that would get started ""shortly"".The government recently appointed T. Chandrashekar, an IAS officer with an excellent track record, to head the Mumbai Metropolitan Regional Development Authority and implement projects collectively valued at Rs 3,000 crore.

Remarking that the DF government had failed to live up to people''s expectations, leader of the opposition Narayan Rane blamed the coalition for the rising debts (Rs 73,000 crore), power crisis, siphoning of public funds worth a few hundred crores by cooperative institutions and the downgrading of the creditworthiness of the state by Crisil.

A senior Mantralaya official said the DF government had inherited a debt burden of Rs 32,000 crore from the Shiv Sena-BJP government. ""But instead of introducing tough measures to improve the situation, the government has increased the burden to an unprecedented Rs 73,000 crore."" Echoing his views, another official said, ""The situation is alarming. But what is worse is that the government is still to realise the gravity of the situation.""

Successive credit downgrading of irrigation corporations such as the Maharashtra Krishna Vikas Development Corporation (MKVDC) has virtually reduced them to junk status.

Despite having spent over Rs 14,000 crore only on the MKVDC, which is under irrigation minister Ajit Pawar, the project is far from complete. Besides, complaints of non-payment of salary to the staff and pending contractors bills are regular.

Money-guzzling schemes such as the cotton monopoly procurement scheme continues purely for political gains, never mind the losses mounting to Rs 2,900 crore. The state government will require another Rs 1,000 crore this season for the scheme.

While part of the fundsâ€”over Rs 500 croreâ€” are to be raised with assistance from the Maharashtra State Cooperative Bank (MSCB), the remaining amount is likely to be withdrawn from the contingency funds.

15,Road mishaps increase in city,"MUMBAI: The Salman Khan incident has served to highlight that more Mumbaikars are being killed in road accidents every year. Last year, 523 city residents died on the roads, up from 379 in 1997.

The number of fatalities shot up even as the number of accidents in Mumbai remaining constant, at around 26,000 through the period. Fatalities witnessed a spurt in 1999, shooting up from 411 from 351 the previous year, according to the traffic police. The figure went up marginally to 441 fatalities in 2000. The next big jump was in 2001, when 523 Mumbaikars lost their lives in accidents.

Nearly three of every four people killed were pedestrians. For instance, in 2001, as many as 401 of the 523 killed were pedestrians. The Mumbai traffic police has never released detailed statistics of accidents, nor has it analysed the reasons for the mishaps.

Traffic police chiefs do not discuss the reasons even during the mandatory seminars during Road Safety Week every January.

The only recent analysis of road accidents in Mumbai was conducted by the Pune-based Centre for Road Safety in 1999. The survey, commissioned by the Central Institute of Road Transport, said that trucks, tankers and trailers were responsible one-third of the 411 fatal vehicular accidents in 1999.

Together, they were responsible for 144 of the 423 deaths that year. BEST buses came next, killing 31 persons. In most of the cases, driver fault was the cause of the accident, the study noted.

According to A.K. Nandi, a member of the Western India Automobile Association''s traffic safety committee, awareness about traffic rules is abysmal. ""People don''t even know that a blinking red signal in the night means there is a dangerous junction ahead,"" he says.

Adds joint commissioner of police (traffic) Sunil Vaidya, ""Motorists have yet to realise that drinking and driving is dangerous."" In the nine days after the Salman Khan incident, his department booked as many as 763 motorists for drunken driving. Not all of them were cabbies or truckers; a significant percentage of them were youngsters from affluent families.

Representatives of pedestrian organisations point out that the spurt in fatalities in 1999 coincided with the inauguration of a series of flyovers; 14 on the Western Express highway and 12 on the Eastern Express highway.

Planners had ignored subways to allow pedestrians to cross safely. Despite the increasing fatalities, some experts say that the figures are not all that alarming, given that 250 new cars are added each day, most of them with ill-trained drivers behind the wheels. B.K. Singh of the Loss Prevention Association of India notes that roads account for less than 12 per cent of Mumbai''s area, whereas the international norm is 25 per cent.

The corresponding figure in Delhi is 30. Considering this, Mr Singh says, the number of fatalities in Mumbai is not high. Figures released by the Mumbai police show that while Delhi has 0.65 accidents per 1,000 vehicles and Bangalore has 0.50, the figure in Bombay is only 0.32.

16,Govt increases frequency of buses on Ring Road,"NEW DELHI: Commuters can now expect buses every 10 minutes on the outer Ring Road. And Rs 10 is the amount one has to pay for travelling the entire 100-km route. Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) revitalised the service on the outer Ring Road and east Delhi after the success of the Mudrika service.

Delhi state transport minister Ajay Maken said: â€˜â€˜We have introduced 60 buses that will ply non-stop. And the crew will be changed en route. While 30 will complete their trip from one side, the rest will complete the circle from the opposite direction.â€™â€™ The services will be available from 5 am to 12 at night from October 24.

DTCâ€™s famed â€˜Mudrika sewaâ€™ was revived recently with 80 buses. The service is available every five minutes. Now the outer Ring Road bus service will cover Laxmi Nagar, Sarai Kale Khan terminal, Kalkaji, Hamdard Nagar, R K Puram, Dhaula Kuan, Delhi Cantonment, Janakpuri, Uttam Nagar terminal, Peeragarhi, Rohini, Wazirabad bridge and Dilshad Garden.

â€˜â€˜Mudrika bus services is one of the significant reasons for better revenue returns in the past few days. We have registered a 15 per cent increase in our daily earnings. We hope to shoot it up further with the outer Ring Road service,â€™â€™ Maken said. DTC chairman A J S Sahni said the entire stretch of 100 km, which is the length of the Outer Ring Road route, will be covered in five hours. The services will start from three points â€” Anand Vihar terminal, Dhaula Kuan and Uttam Nagar terminal.

Maken said: â€˜â€˜The buses will be driven and conducted by â€˜jumping crewsâ€™. This means that buses will not have to go to the depots for changing crew after a trip. The driver and conductor for the next shift will take over in the course of the trip.â€™â€™ A similar technique is being used for the continuity of operation on the Ring Road. The efficiency of the bus service will be improved with the deployment of the DTCâ€™s retainer crew as ticket-checking staff. â€˜â€˜These employees are already being put on duty for checking ticketless travellers on all routes. About 500 such teams are already doing the rounds in the city,â€™â€™ Sahni said. Besides, the DTC has also identified the trunk routes in each depot that are usually in demand and has provided buses at a regular interval of five minutes. Some of these routes are 73, 85, 247, 307, 883 and 982. â€˜â€˜These identified routes have also helped the DTC improve its revenue as the earning potential on these routes is very high,â€™â€™ Maken said.

17,Sale of govt stake in core sector projects soon,"MUMBAI: It''s a piece of legislation that could finally provide the ''Midas touch'' to Maharashtra''s infrastructure woes. The state government is finalising a new law to enable it to disinvest its stake in large core sector projects, allow private parties to bid for fresh projects and create an independent body to resolve disputes.

The Maharashtra Infrastructure Development and Support Act (Midas) â€”as the new legislation will be calledâ€”will be announced at the Maharashtra Infrastructure Summit 2002, scheduled for November 10-12, where plans for the new legislation along with more than Rs 5,000 crore worth of projects will be announced for private participation, said sources.

The state government has formed a core group of bureaucrats headed by the industry secretary to finalise the new legislation.

Hemant Joshi, chief operating officer of the private credit rating agency Crisil, which is helping the state draft the new rules, said that a new Infrastructure Authority would be set up to oversee all basic projects for which private participation was required. The new legislation would allow both international and domestic investors to bid for state projects.

""With this legislation, the state can monetise its investments in several viable infrastructure projects by disinvesting its stake to private parties,"" he added.

Under the new act, a private investor can put in a proposal to start a project, which would then be globally notified to invite competitive tenders. The new act will even supercede government departments in case of any delay in processing clearances, sources said.

Some of the large infrastructure projects to be unveiled to private parties at the summit are a special economic zone in Navi Mumbai, an international airport project in Navi Mumbai and a multi-nodal hub at Nagpur.

""It may be a revised version of an existing legislation, but for the state government its impact will be drastic,"" sources said.

18,Another left-right battle in JNU students’ polls,"NEW DELHI: If Godhra and saffronisation of education are issues likely to be taken up by the leftist groups, then the Akshardham carnage may be highlighted by the right-wing groups. Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) elections are here, and student groups are busy sprucing up their artillery for attacking the enemy ideology.

Interestingly, while national and international issues change every year, the campus issues have more or less remained the same over the past few years. Last year, it was the bombing of Afghanistan by USA, and earlier the American attack on Iraq.

On the other hand, campus issues this year too are likely to centre around better hostel, library and Internet facilities. With a spurt in incidents of eveteasing, security may also make it to the list.

The left-wing Studentsâ€™ Federation of India (SFI) wants to stress on strengthening the Gender Sensitisation Committee Against Sexual Harassment (GSCASH). â€˜â€˜The setting up of the committee on the X plan proposal is a major achievement,â€™â€™ SFI member Vijoo Krishnan said. The plan suggested setting up of a centre for human consciousness, among other things. The step was taken after the JNU Studentsâ€™ Union sat on an indefinite hunger strike. But there are many who are sceptical. â€˜â€˜Hunger strikes have become a ritual. Every year, the studentsâ€™ union sits on a strike, and hails that as an achievement during elections,â€™â€™ a Centre for Political Science student said.

The right-wing Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) wants to cash on to issues such as the frequency of buses in the campus. â€˜â€˜The SFI has failed to fulfil promises of getting science scholarships or a rebate on movie tickets,â€™â€™ said Ranvijay Singh, an ABVP supporter. The ruling groups have also been unable to do anything about the mess facilities in Mahi and Mandwi hostels, he alleged.

But the left is quick to rebut. â€˜â€˜That was an issue even last year when the ABVP held the presidential post,â€™â€™ a School of Languages student said. Better library and Internet facilities are other contentious issues. â€˜â€˜Last year, the ABVP got the authorisation for getting more books, but the process was not completed,â€™â€™ said Manmat Narayan Singh, a research scholar. The Left heaps blame on the ABVP for the recent violence on the campus following a visit by Rashtriya Swayam Sevak leader Ashok Singhal. A proctorial inquiry had been ordered, but no conclusion was reached. History teacher Harbans Mukhia feels the studentsâ€™ union has not been able to overcome the hangover of the socialistic days. â€˜â€˜In those days, the anti-establishment stand was in. Student groups have to make noise,â€™â€™ he said.

19,I haven't seen such a weak Central govt: Thackeray,"MUMBAI: Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray stood firm on his appeal to militant Hindus to form suicide squads to counter Pakistan-sponsored terrorism. At a press conference on Friday, he said that he was not worried about the legal implications of his appeal.

He also reiterated his criticism of Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee''s handling of cross-border terrorism. He is also not worried about the legal fallout of his call.

""I have never seen such a weak Central government,"" Mr Thackeray said. ""It talks bravely but does nothing. I am staying with the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) since I do not want the Vajpayee government to face any problems on my account. But my patience has limits. I will be compelled to reconsider the Sena''s policy (of supporting the NDA ministry) if the situation deteriorates"".

Mr Thackeray claimed not to attach any importance to case filed against him by the Mumbai police for inciting communal disharmony through his Dassera speech. I will not seek anticipatory bail. Nor do I regret what I said,"" he said. ""My remarks were against Pakistani terrorists and not against any section of Indian population. If the government feels that it can punish me for speaking against terrorists, am ready to face any action"".

The Sena chief alleged that the case was filed against him at the behest of chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh.

There was no reaction to my Dasara speech,"" Mr Thackeray said. ""Law and order was not disturbed. And suddenly the case was filed. It was because of Mr Deshmukh"".

However, a few hours after Mr Thackeray''s remarks, minister of state for home Kripashankar Singh denied that the chief minister had ordered the police to file the case. ""I have spoken with Mr Deshmukh before making this clarification,"" he said.

Mr Singh told reporters that the police filed the case against Mr Thackeray as a matter of routine. Such cases are filed by the police if it is felt prima facie that objectionable statements have been made.

The cases are then investigated and the state government''s permission sought before prosecuting the person concerned.

""In this case, the government is still not in the picture. It is a police matter as of now,"" Mr Singh said.

Mr Thackeray''s residence, Matoshri, had been besieged by the media since Friday morning because of rumours that he was going to be arrested for his speech. Owing to heavy police bandobast, Shiv Sainiks were not permitted to hang around Kala Nagar in Bandra (east), where the bungalow is located. The media was allowed to enter the bungalow after intensive frisking.

Mr Thackeray appeared in his saffron robe, accompanied by former chief minister Narayan Rane. His son Uddhav, nephew Raj, Sena deputy leader Shishir Shinde and Mumbai mayor Mahadev Devle were the only party officials present.

Mr Thackeray fielded every question in his customary style, without mincing words.

Asked about a reported statement pf Lok Sabha speaker Manohar Joshi that Sena ministers in the Union cabinet would resign if Mr Thackeray was prosecuted, the Sena chief shot back saying that Mr Joshi was a Shiv Sainik and hence had spoken on behalf of the Sena.

But in the same breath, the Sena chief said, ""The question of waging a war with Pakistan is out of the question because our neighbour precisely wants this to happen. My thinking is limited by the possible chaos that could take place if the Vajpayee government is no more, for any reason. But now or later, I will have to take a decision on staying with the NDA government if the issue of terrorism is handled in the same inept manner"".

Making it clear that he did not care what the state government or the ruling BJP at the Centre felt about his call at the Dassera rally on forming suicide squads, Mr Thackeray retorted, ""I do not know what the BJP or anyone else feels about my statements. I have been facing criticism for the past 36 years. But in this situation, I am gratified that the Vishwa Hindu Parishad and the Bajrang Dal have supported my idea"".

The Sena chief also welcomed an observation by senior Congress leader and legal expert Ramrao Adik that no case could be made against Mr Thackeray since the Sena chief had spoken only against Pakistani terrorists and not against any section of the Indian population.

Mr Thackeray said that he would not like to reveal how the squads would be formed or when or where they could strike.

Meanwhile, BJP president Venkaiah Naidu said in Mumbai on Friday that the state government''s decision to file a case against Mr Thackeray was politically motivated. ""The BJP may not agree with some of Mr Thackeray''s statements. But this does not mean that the government can harass the Sena chief,"" Mr Naidu said.

BJP vice president Gopinath Munde said no case could be made against Mr Thackeray since the Sena chief had spoken against terrorism and not against any section of the population.

What Mr Thackeray preached was nothing but pure patriotism, he said.
