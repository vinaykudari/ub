1,TDP ministers may join Advani's 'shining' rally,"HYDERABAD: Chief minister Chandrababu Naidu said on Sunday that the TDP was considering the possibility of joining Deputy Prime Minister L K Advaniâ€™s controversial rath yatra when it enters AP on March 16.

""Whatâ€™s wrong in it. The BJP and the TDP have development as agenda. There is no confusion on this. Only development can get votes for any party,"" Naidu told reporters on Sunday. Though Naidu would not join the yatra, he might ask the district in-charge ministers to welcome Advani at the entry point.

Replying to a barrage of questions on the statement made by BJP leaders that Ram temple issue would be part of their vision document, Naidu said the BJP may include anything it likes in its vision document but it has categorically stated that it would go to the polls with the NDA agenda and would stick to it.

""The TDP is committed for secularism and NDA agenda. As long as the BJP adheres to this agreement, the TDP would continue to stand by them.""

2,Colleges still cold to govt appeal,"BANGALORE: The governmentâ€™s appeal asking private professional colleges to align with the state CET for filling up management quota seats has received poor response.

So far, only 56 engineering and four dental colleges have responded positively to the invitation. No medical college has come forward to accept the stateâ€™s appeal.

Though the governmentâ€™s deadline asking colleges to respond to the plea ends on Monday, the committee for overseeing the conduct of the entrance test has asked all professional colleges to give details on how they propose to fill the management quota seats by March 12.

Either way, a clear picture will emerge by the end of this week on what managements propose to do to fill up their quota of seats â€” go with Consortium of Medical, Engineering and Dental Colleges of Karnataka (Comed) or float another association. But, the Supreme Court has made it mandatory for colleges to fill up management quota of seats through an association. Comed is meeting on Monday. Out of the total 39,010 engineering seats available, nearly 20,000 seats would be filled by the state CET under the 50 per cent government quota. This number will increase, but by how much will depend on the number of colleges and the per cent of management quota seats they are willing to concede.

Similarly, out of the total 2,767 medical seats available, nearly 1,384 would be filled by the state CET under the 50 per cent government quota. With no medical college willing to accept the state CET, this number is unlikely to increase. Of the 2,320, the state CET will have only about 1160 dental seats in its kitty and a partial increase is expected with four colleges agreeing to come under its ambit for management quota seat selection also.

4,"In polls, small is beautiful","NEW DELHI: If you are a teacher in a government school or working as a municipal clerk, or doing some daily grind in some government office, the chances are high that you''ll be envious of the bada sahab.

But if you have political ambitions and are thinking of elections, then the roles are reversed.

The small guy has the upper hand over the bada sahebs when it comes to entering elections. Officers in a supervisory positions or private contractors undertaking government projects may not enter the electoral arena while holding on to their positions.

If voted in, their election can be set aside on the ground of enjoying an ""office of profit"" while seeking votes.

In contrast, government school teachers, municipal clerks and others performing subordinate functions in government and semi-government institutions are immune from the restrictions imposed by the Constitution on candidates.

Similarly, professionals such as lawyers, doctors and information technocrats who are on government panels, are not deemed to be holding an ""office of profit"" and therefore are eligible to contest.

The question of what constitutes an ""office of profit"" was dealt with at length by the then Chief Justice of India Adarsh Sein Anand three years ago in a case concerning the constitutional provisions meant to help the law-makers to discharge their duties freely and fearlessly.

While Articles 191(1)(a) and 102(1)(a) of the Constitution call for the disqualification of an elected candidate holding an office of profit, it has been left to Parliament to devise criteria.

In the case, Justice Anand was dealing with JMM leader Shibu Soren''s appeal against the Patna High Court order which had set aside his election to the Rajya Sabha as he was chairman of the ""interim council of the Jharkhand area autonomous council"".

Soren had argued he could not be disqualified as he was not getting a salary.

However, the apex court upheld the high court''s view that Soren did not enjoy any immunity because he was, even while holding an ""honorary"" position, drawing perks and other financial benefits from the government.

And so, the petitioner Dayanand Sahay was declared elected in Soren''s place.

Justice Anand said three elements determined whether an elected candidate could be unseated on the ground of holding an office of profit: Whether he is holding a government post; If, yes, is it an ""office of profit""; whether the office is other than one declared by law not to disqualify its holder.

The definition of ""office of profit"" has rightly been expanded by the court, otherwise anyone who is paid a fee for rendering know-how to the government gets elected would be unseated. This has been nipped in the bud.
