1,Police arrest Sant Daduwal on murder charges,"BATHINDA: An unsavoury controversy shrouded Sant Baba Baljit Singh Daduwal, a renowned preacher of the area, after he was arrested by the Bathinda police on Sunday evening for murder and abduction.

The Baba, who is known for his proximity with Baba Sarbjot Singh Bedi of Sant Samaj and Gurcharan Singh Tohra, had allegedly attempted to kidnap and kill one Jagsir Singh of Tungwali village, who was â€˜â€˜spreading canardsâ€� against the Baba.

Interestingly, Jagsir Singh was a staunch follower of Sant Daduwal who has a considerable following in Punjab and Haryana. Jagsir alleged that he left the Baba once he saw him in a compromising position with a woman in his dera situated in Kot Shamir village, about one-and-a-half years back. â€˜â€˜Since then, the Baba and his followers are preying on me,â€� alleged Jagsir.

â€˜â€˜When I was returning to my village after selling fodder at Bathinda, the Baba and his seven followers, armed with weapons, started chasing me in a Tata Safari. The Baba was in Bathinda to attend a seminar organised by the Sant Samaj. To save my life I entered the Bathinda cantonment area and was followed by the Baba and his followers. However, they were all taken into custody by military jawans and handed over to the Bathinda police,â€� he said.

Acting on a complaint by Jagsir Singh that the Baba was trying to eliminate him so that he could not reveal his misdeeds to thousands of his followers, the police registered a case under sections 341, 365, 506, 511, 148, 149, IPC ( kidnapping and assault) and sections 25, 54, 59 of the Arms Act. The police recovered a .12 bore double barrel gun and 22 live cartridges from Baba and his followers.

Some political leaders of the area, who got to know that Sant Daduwal was in police custody, rushed to his rescue, but the police was bent on taking legal action against him. The police, fearing that the Babaâ€™s followers would stage a dharna in front of the Cantonment police station, produced him at the residence of the duty magistrate who remanded him to judicial custody till September 21. Immediate after the Baba was shifted to Central Jail, Bathinda, he complained of chest pain and was transferred to Civil Hospital, Bathinda.

Talking to Times News Network at the hospital, the Baba denied the allegation, saying that Jagsir was trying to mislead his followers by levelling false allegations. â€˜â€˜I had no intention to cause any harm to Jagsir Singh. only wanted to ask him why he was harbouring ill-will against me, said the Baba, alleging that he was entangled in a false case at the instance of SAD (B) leaders.

2,Rlys increases coal movement to PSEB plants,"PATIALA: Indian Railways, which had threatened to stop the movement of coal from coal fields to the thermal plants of the Punjab State Electricity Board (PSEB), has started normalising the coal movement after the PSEB started paying the pending freight bills.

On Sunday, six racks of coal reached at Ropar, three Bathinda and three at Lehra Mohabbat thermal plants. However, the Bathinda thermal plant is still in critical condition with the coal stock for merely six days.

Water level up in dams: The water level in dams has started going up due to rain their catchment areas. At Bhakhra Dam, the water level has gone up to 1,650 feet as compared to 1,648 feet last year. The inflow of water in the dam is 52,000 cusec, while 21,000 cusec is being released.

At Ranjit Sagar Dam, inflow of water is 9,000 cusec while the release is 4,000 cusec. The level here has reached 502.1 metres compared to last yearâ€™s level of 518 feet. In Pong Dam, only 5,000 cusec water is being released against the inflow of 26,000 cusec. But, the water level here is still 1,330 feet, 45 feet down compared to last year.

Police launches campaign register migrants: The district police has launched a special campaign to register migrants living in different localities of the city and other towns of the district. According to SSP Paramraj Singh Umra Nangal, all the landlords and owners of firms had been asked to submit the names, addresses and photographs of the migrants living as tenants or working the firms.

He said that the people had also been asked to submit the details of their domestic servants. Talking to The Times of India, Umra Nangal said that this step was being taken to curb crime as in many cases, involvement of domestic servants and other migrants had been found.

He cautioned that the police would take strict action against those failing to submit the details.

A similar campaign has also been launched in Fatehgarh Sahib district by SSP B Chandrasekhar.

BKU on dharna in front of sugar mill: The Bharatiya Kisan Union (Ekta) led by Pishora Singh Sidhupur has started staging daily dharna in front of the Rakhra Sugar Mills to press the authorities to pay an amount of Rs 5.5 crore to the farmers which is pending since long.

A few weeks ago, the BKU activists had gheraoed a senior officer of the mill who was released only after the assurance that the payments would be released very soon.

BKU general secretary Gurmit Singh Dittupur said that an amount of around Rs 100 crore of the farmers was lying pending with the co-operative sugar mills in the state against the sugarcane purchased by these mills.

3,"Parties promise power, but people want development","SRINAGAR: The concerns of the people have found no place in the agenda of political parties for the 2002 assembly elections.

Contrary to the political partiesâ€™ claim, twenty years after militancy started in the state, major issues like greater autonomy, more powers, or dialogue with Centre leave the people cold. What they want are better roads, clean drinking water, healthcare, education and jobs for all.

But ignoring the basic needs of people, both regional and the national parties have spoken mainly of politics in their manifestos.

The National Conference manifesto is mainly about greater autonomy. The Congress goes a step ahead and claims that autonomy and more powers for the state is an aspiration of the people. But attend any public rally and the reality becomes only too clear. No applause greets the slogans on autonomy or devolution of more powers. The cheers are only reserved for the bits on jobs, roads and education.

Even Omar Abdullah, president of the ruling National Conference, admits this. Gulam Nabi Azad, president J&K Pradesh Congress committee, however, strikes a defensive posture. â€˜â€˜Politics in Kashmir comes first for every individual. So the Congress has made a demand for greater autonomy,â€™â€™ he says.

He, moreover, refutes the suggestion that the people are concerned with the development of the state. What they want, he maintains, is the resolution of political issues.

The people, naturally, are not too happy. Shafiq Ahmad Khan of Lal Chowk feels cheated with the promises of the political parties. All he wants is a clean government which could provide jobs for the unemployed, roads and other basic facilities.

Zahoor Ahmad Mir of Tangmarg only wants peace for the Valley, where the focus would be on the essentials of life. â€˜â€˜We have no roads, no water, no electricity and still politicians talk about politics,â€™â€™ he says.

The government, feels Mohammad Yasin Shah of Rawalpora, should concentrate on the economic development of the state, instead of demanding more powers.

Shah wants road connectivity for his locality. Despite the residents meeting the the state works minister several times, all their pleas have been ignored so far.

4,Pratapgarh CLP leader cleared in rioting case,"PRATAPGARH: The Lalganj police have given a clean chit to Congress Legislative Party (CLP) leader Pramod Tewari and others against whom an FIR was lodged by Apna Dal workers.

The Apna Dal workers had accused the CLP leader and others of beating them up and issuing life threats to them in the last Assembly elections.

The station house officer (SHO) of the Lalganj police station, in his report, stated that a fake case had been registered against Tewari and others and the complainants were liable to be booked under the Section 182 of the IPC for lodging a fake FIR.

It may be mentioned that only a few days back the judicial magistrate, Pratapgarh had directed the Lalganj police station to lodge an FIR against Tewari, his son-in-law Ambika Prasad and his daughter Aradhana under the Section 156 (3) for assaulting the Apna Dal workers in Rampur Khas in the last Assembly elections. The directive was given on a complaint filed by Apna Dal workers Kamata Prasad Patel and Kallu Singh of Sarai Sangram Singh village under the Lalganj police station.

The complainants had alleged that while they were returning to the city along with their friends Tulsiram and Teerath after taking part in a bicycle rally in Rampur Khas, Tewari and his associates damaged their bicycles, tore away their party flags and assaulted them.

They further alleged that they were forcibly taken by Tiwari and his men to the Lalganj police station where the police registered a fake case against them under the Arms Act. The matter did not end here and the Congress leader and his supporters reached Kamataâ€™s house the next day and beat up his brother Ramphal and children.

Kamata had stated that he contacted the then SP Jay Narayan Singh to seek his intervention in the matter but to no avail.

He then moved the court against the culprits. Later, the CJM directed the police to lodge an FIR against Tewari and his relatives.

5,Pandal politics is new route to power,"MUMBAI: Mumbai today will keep its tryst with Lord Ganesha amidst throaty cheers of â€˜Ganapati Bappa Moryaâ€™, unveiling a carnival that mirrors the myriad moods of the metropolis. The ten-day festival is a great leveller that splendidly blends the cityâ€™s sub-culturesâ€”embracing its tribes of netizens and â€˜netasâ€™.

But amidst all the festivity, some in the cityâ€™s cultural circles are perturbed. Itâ€™s becoming increasingly apparent that politicians, never mind their tags, have seized control many of the 8,000 premier Ganesh festival committees in Mumbai.

Last week, well-known publisher and scholar Jayant Salgaonkar lamented the growing clout of political parties in the management of a festival which is largely viewed by Mumbaikars as a secular event. But politicians arenâ€™t able to see the problem. â€œPolitics and the Ganpati festival go hand-in-hand chiefly because the deity attracts a mammoth following which political parties obviously covet,â€™â€™ said Shiv Sena leader and former minister Pramod Navalkar. Still, Mr Navalkar admitted that the singular aim of the festival as espoused by Lokmanya Tilakâ€”the propagation and promotion of a social causeâ€”seems lost in the melee.

â€œThe festival seems to have been hopelessly commercialised and the â€˜varganiâ€™ (subscription) tally gallops to an astronomical figure,â€™â€™ he said. Over the years, however, scores of Sena functionaries have graduated from local Ganesh â€˜mandalsâ€™ to Mantralaya, the seat of the state government. Today, the party has a firm grip on as many as 90 Ganeshotsav mandals in south-central Mumbai alone.

Other political parties have followed suit. Declared senior Nationalist Congress Party functionary Gurunath Kulkarni, â€œNo single political party can have proprietorial rights over Lord Ganesha. The festival has an element of connectedness which fascinates political activists of every hue.â€™â€™

Unfazed by the Senaâ€™s aggressiveness in matters religious, the city unit of the Nationalist Congress Party has also made inroads into several pocketboroughs under the leadership of deputy chief minister Chhagan Bhujbal and party MLA Sachin Ahir. BRCC chief Murli Deora, minister of state for home Kripashankar Singh and Jagannathrao Hegde lead the Congress band â€˜Deva ho deva, Ganapati deva, tumse badhkar kaunâ€™.

The Mumbai BJP seems raring go to the cries of â€˜sukha-karta, dukhhartaâ€™. Said Vinod Tawde, chief the BJPâ€™s city unit, â€œThe Ganesh festival represents all that is vibrant and vivacious in Mumbaiâ€™s life. Itâ€™s socio-cultural event, with a great emphasis on participation. So, we actually encourage our party workers keep in touch with various â€˜ganeshmandalsâ€™, especially those which are sensitive to social causes.â€™â€™

6,L-G denies power of elected govt curtailed,"NEW DELHI: Lieutenant governor Vijai Kapoor on Monday sought to clear the air on the confusion over the Centreâ€™s recent amendment to Transaction of Business Rules for NCT Act. He said the amendment did not curtail the existing powers of Delhiâ€™s elected government and the legislative assembly. Kapoor said the Union home ministryâ€™s amendment was being misinterpreted by the Sheila Dikshit government. â€˜â€˜I sought advice from the Union law ministry and the Delhi state governmentâ€™s law department on this matter and found that the elected governmentâ€™s existing powers have not been touched,â€™â€™ he clarified. Reacting to the Centreâ€™s move to substitute the term â€˜â€˜Billâ€™â€™ with â€˜â€˜legislative proposalsâ€™â€™ in the business rules, Kapoor said it was applicable to matters on which laws had already been enacted in the Parliament. â€˜â€˜Earlier, Bills on such matters were sent to L-G after they were passed by the legislative assembly. Now, a proposal regarding such a legislation would require approval from the Centre before it is introduced in the Delhi assembly,â€™â€™ he said. Kapoor said the state government would continue to exercise full powers over transfer subjects, but the L-Gâ€™s approval on administrative matters relating to reserve subjects was being made mandatory. Under the NCT Act, the L-G has been given control over police, law and order and land. For all other subjects, the L-G has to act on the â€˜â€˜aid and advice of the council of ministersâ€™â€™. Kapoor said as sometimes, files related to these subjects did not come to him, the MHA amended the business rules for Section 44 of the NCT Act, thereby making it â€˜â€˜essentialâ€™â€™ for the elected government to send all files related to the subject to him. Kapoor said: â€˜â€˜To plug the lacunae in existing rules, amendments were brought about. â€™â€™

7,We can't sacrifice trees for airport: Rabri govt,"PATNA: The state government expressedly stands guard to the environmental interests, as prescribed by the Union ministry of forest and environment as well as a ruling in this regard by the Supreme Court.

However, what has nettled minister for forest and environment Jagdanand Singh, and his officials here is the letter of former airport director of Jaya Prakash Narain International (JPNI) Airport, Patna, dated December 14, 2000, addressed to the director Sanjay Gandhi Biological Park, for removal of trees that obstruct the approach path of the airport. Former airport director had also sent a map to the director, Sanjay Gandhi Biological Park, stating that a large part of the park with trees of high growth fall within the approach funnel of the airport and therefore, they needed to be removed.

This was the initial shock to the state government and chief minister Rabri Devi had promptly replied in February 2001 that the Airport Authority of India (AAI) may shift the Patna airport to Bihta if there was any such necessity at all. Her view was based on the forest departmentâ€™s plea that the cause of environment could not be sacrificed at the altar of the air services that were to be provided to microscopic minority of VIPs and bigwigs.

â€œThe citizens of Patna should not be robbed of the oxygen in the only left slush green space full of trees, the â€˜lungâ€™, left within the periphery of the state capital, that is the Sanjay Gandhi Biological Park.â€� â€œIf the AAI wants to run the Patna airport, it should be operated with the safety norms which can be applied by keeping the environmental considerations,â€� according to the forest department sources. From this point of view, the current pruning of trees in the approach funnel is being allowed and the Patna airport is being run smoothly, the sources added.

This stand of the state government may seem to be political as it has come as a direct confrontation with the Union ministry of civil aviation. But the state ministry of forest and environment adhere to the point that it had to concur with environmental stand taken by the Union ministry of forest and environment as per the provisions of environmental Laws.According to sources in the department, in many cases, the state government had tough time in getting clearance from the Union ministry of forest and environment for uprooting the trees in pursuance of different projects, including the irrigations projects.

8,KoPT incentive for better dredging,"KOLKATA: The Kolkata Port Trust authorities have decided to introduce a system of incentives and disincentives for better dredging of the Hooghly river, KoPT marine department director Gautam Sen said on Monday.

Talking to TNN, Sen said the Dredging Corporation of India would be given an amo-unt in excess of its monthly bills if it could maintain a depth of over five metres in the Jellingham Channel near Haldia where it was engaged in â€œmaintenance dredgingâ€�. Likewise, if it could not maintain the five metre draft, a part would be deducted from its monthly bills.

Maintenance dredging is necessary to maintain the navigability of the shipping channels leading to Kolkata and Haldia docks, done mainly by the DCI, round the year. Annually, over Rs 300 crore is spent on this exercise.

It had also been decided that the DCI would go for â€œshore disposalâ€� of the spoils (the dredged matter) of dredging from December onwards. The spoils would be deposited in Nayachar islands near Haldia, an island practically uninhabited.

Hitherto, the agencies involved in dredging were depositing the spoils of dredging in the Hooghly river. A public interest litigation, filed by former Jadavpur University faculty member Aloke Sanyal before the Calcutta High Court, had argued that dredging spoils should not be thrown back into the river, but should be permanently removed ashore.

It was no wonder that the navigability of the river did not improve for nearly 95 per cent of the spoil returned to the dredged spot and the spoils were thrown back into the river, Sanyalâ€™s affidavit had stated. KoPT stated in its affidavit-in-opposition that nearly 20 million cubic metres of dredged spoil was removed from the river bed every year. Because of non-availability of vast areas of land, shore disposal was difficult. Besides, shore disposal was more costly.

Sen said a â€œcapital dredgingâ€� of the Balari bar, restricting flow of water to the dock â€” would start as soon as the tenders were finalised, at a cost of Rs 350 crore. The tender committee would meet on Tuesday with three shortlisted firms, two Dutch and one Belgian.

Capital dre-dging meant dredging a new channel to improve navigability. The project, scheduled to start from July, was delayed, however, because of deviations from KoPTâ€™s conditions. â€œWe will not compromise on basic parameters like the depth of the channel to be dredged or an assurance that the depth would be maintained,â€� Sen said.

Here, too, the spoils of the dredging would have to be disposed on shore by the contractor. A 10-km long and 4.5 metre deep channel would be cut from near the Haldia oil jetty to Kulpi.

9,Shiv Sainiks protest screening of Ek Chhoti Si... in city,"PATNA: The much-publicised protest on Monday by Shiv Sainiks against screening of Ek Chhoti Si Love Story in Patna turned out to be a â€˜Chhoti Si Protest Storyâ€™, which appeared to be tailormade for the media. A group of lathi-wielding Sainiks reached Ashok theatre at around 1 pm and manifested their protest by smashing the rear window of a private car, apart from damaging a poster in the presence of press photographers.

The Shiv Sainiks remained inside the cinema hallâ€™s premises hardly for two minutes, and then made a hasty retreat as the movie hall staff and policemen prepared to counter them. Later, Bihar Shiv Sena chief Dev Swaroop Pandey made a speech, and many of the amused youths, who had failed to get the noon show tickets, looked on.

Pandey stressed that ashlil (obscene) movies like Ek Chhoti Si Love Story was an attack on the Indian culture. â€œThe British used to show obscene films to people of the country (India) so that our social culture is destroyed,â€� he said, adding that the teenagers who see the film â€œwould become rapistsâ€�. â€œWho will be responsible for it,â€� he asked, and justified the vandalism indulged in by the Shiv Sainiks at the behest of Balasaheb Thackeray in the cinema halls of Mumbai screening the same film.

Pandey said he would talk to the management of the Ashok cinema hall and request it to withdraw the movie. If the movie was not taken off the screen then the Bihar unit of his party would intensify its agitation, he said, adding â€œit will be a bigger show.â€�

Ironically, the owner of the cinema hall screening the Indian remake of a Polish film heads the state RSS. The hallâ€™s staff remained undaunted by the Sainiksâ€™ threat. â€œThere is no question of withdrawing the film. It can only be withdrawn if the district administration issues orders to this effect, or if there is a court order,â€� said the theatreâ€™s director, S P N Singh.

Incidentally, the Shiv Sainiks had threatened to stage their protest at 12 noon. A huge crowd, in which the youngsters were predominant, continued to hang around either to get inside the hall or to purchase tickets from blackmarketeers as the booking counter showed houseful sign within 15 minutes of its opening. The black market rate was as high as Rs 100 for a balcony ticket.

â€œThis is not Mumbai. The Shiv Sainiks are not a force here. If they try to be violent then they will be bashed up by the cine goers,â€� said a staff of the hall, visibly happy at the grand success of the film.

Around 12 noon, not a single policeman was visible at the venue. However, at around 12.30 pm, a police jeep was parked at the gate of the hall. The Shiv Sainiks waited for the cine goers to enter the hall, and then executed their two-minute protest. Incidentally, the same cinema hall witnessed protests a few years ago when the controversial movie â€˜Fireâ€™ was being screened.

11,Left parties protest sale of shopping complexes,"VIJAYAWADA: The CPI and the CPM have launched a signature campaign here on Monday against the Vijayawada Municipal Corporation''s move to privatise marriage halls and sell away shopping complexes.

The two parties would collect one lakh signatures in the next three days under the campaign, according to city CPI secretary K Sekhar Babu and CPM secretary Ch Babu Rao. This is a counter to the VMC''s public opinion survey on these issues.

They told reporters here on Monday that a massive rally would be taken out from the Tummalapallivari Kshetrayya Kalakshetram to the VMC office on September 13. ""We will later lay siege to the VMC office as the Council is scheduled to meet that day to discuss the vital issues,"" they added.

The two Left-wing parties would also hold dharnas at the four high-level water reservoirs in the city to protest the hike in drinking water cess and tap connection charges. Continuing their tirade against municipal commissioner Praveen Prakash, Sekhar Babu and Babu Rao alleged that the former was acting in haste by ignoring the elected Council.

12,Pak attempts to disrupt JK polls futile: George,"NEW DELHI: Declaring that Pakistan was going all out to disrupt election in Jammu and Kashmir involving its regular enemy forces, Defence Minister George Fernandes on Tuesday said India would not be cowed down by such tactics.

He said the forthcoming elections could mark an end to gun-culture.

Accusing Pakistani forces of indulging in ""highly provocative acts"" all along the Line of Control (LoC) especially in the sector between Drass and Kargil, he said these acts were aimed at provoking Indian counter-attacks, but maintained that New Delhi would not fall prey to such machinations.

He was talking to reporters on the sidelines of a function here.

Elaborating on the Pakistani forces getting involved in disrupting election process in the border state, the Minister, pointed to heavy shelling in Kargil sector and said ""these are signs that even Pakistani forces are getting involved in moves to disrupt the polls"".

Asserting that Islamabad''s support to terrorist violence in Jammu and Kashmir had not ceased, he said India had ""irrefutable evidence on this count"" and had shared this evidence with the United States.

""But due to its own priorities (after the September 11 attack) and the resultant constraints, the US is compelled to work with Pakistan and accord it the status of an ally in the war against terrorism,"" Fernandes said at a function organised by FICCI to mark the ''One Year of Fight Against Terrorism''.

Asked if India reserved the right to cross the LoC if Pakistani provocations and infiltration continued unabated in Jammu and Kashmir, Fernandes said whatever was necessary to combat terrorism, India would do.

Referring to recent step up of attacks on election meetings and political workers in Kashmir, he said possibilities of violence in the elections could not be totally ruled out and cautioned that this indicated what Pakistan intended to disrupt the poll process.

He, however, said all necessary security measures had been taken to ensure protection of candidates, polling officials and the electorate.

Asserting that the movement of Indian armed forces closer to the border has had a ""salutary effect"" on the situation, the Minister said it was only after this initiative that Islamabad had come around to conceding its role in abetting terrorism.

""The January 12 speech by Gen Musharraf, in my view, was impelled by India''s resolve and I believe that the US is aware of this,"" he said.

Saying if the US was focussed on the aftermath of September 11, India had to deal with the same symbolism on December 13, 2001, the day Parliament was attacked by terrorists.

Fernandes said had the terrorists succeeded, India would have been plunged into political disarray and it was to this threat New Delhi had responded in a ""calibrated way"" by redeploying its forces closer to the border.

Fernandes said terrorism was not a new phenomenon for India and that the country had been battling it in one form or the other for almost two decades.

""We have paid a price in human life and limb,"" he said as he recalled that from 1990 to date 13,835 lives had been lost in terrorist related violence and of this 3,255 brave security forces laid down their lives in this ""proxy war"".

Saying that the battle against terrorism had been a long haul for India and would continue for a while, the Minister said New Delhi had faced this challenge with a characteristic mix of restraint and resolve.

""It goes to the credit of Indian state and its resilient people that Punjab has returned to normalcy, while the problem of terrorism is yet to be completely stamped out in Jammu and Kashmir,"" he said.

During the function the US role in continuing support to military regime cropped up time and again and replying to a number questions on this, he said India was aware that the US will act in consonance with its own perceived national interest and to that extent New Delhi did not expect Washington ""to pull our chestnuts out of the fire"".

However, he said India understands the utility and relevance of Pakistan even though it was under a military ruler in the US war against terrorism.

At the same time, the Minister said, the US also realises that whether it is the brutal assassination of Daniel Pearl or the manner in which al-Qaeda and Taliban have disappeared, ""Pakistan is part of the problem and of the solution"".

On the United States'' twin objectives in its crusade against Taliban regime in Afghanistan of capture of Osama bin Laden, dead or alive, and of overthrow of Taliban regime and re-establish democratic rule in that country, Fernandes said he had predicted before the initiation of the US action that the first task may end up as an unfulfilled wish and the second would be a long term gamble.

""What this means is that it will be a long haul for us all before the war against terrorism is won,"" he said.

But the Minister said future of the Indo-US relations went beyond terrorism and the states associated with it, adding that both the countries should work towards realising this potential.

Turning to the participants in the seminar, the Minister called for long-term synergy between Indian Defence and the business sector.

13,Pak army involved in disrupting J&K polls: Fernandes,"NEW DELHI: Defence minister George Fernandes on Tuesday accused Pakistan of involving its regular armed forces to disrupt the election process in Jammu and Kashmir. He asserted that ""irrefutable evidence"" on this score as of Pakistani abetment of cross-border infiltration had been passed on to the US.

He told captains of trade and industry at the FICCI that the US, however, had ""its own priorities"" and ""realpolitik considerations"" in supporting Pakistanâ€™s military regime because of the need to involve the latter as an ""ally"" in combating terrorism.

However, ""the US realises that Pakistan is part of the problem and of the solution"", he said. This explained ""the US ambivalence and discomfiture about Gen Musharraf"".

Fernandes said he was optimistic that Washington would ultimately ""square the circle"" and reconcile the contradictions between its professed values and practices.

Speaking ahead of Prime Minister Vajpayeeâ€™s scheduled meeting with President Bush later this week, Fernandes said what mattered for India was the long-term bilateral relationship with the US that went beyond terrorism. Its potential needed to be fully explored.

""There is no doubt that the US is the pre-eminent power in the world today, and post 9/11, there has been a definitive convergence in the strategic concerns of the US and India. Terrorism looks large in this list.""

However, since the US ""needed"" Pakistan and its military regime, India could not expect it to ""pull the chestnuts out of fire"" in the fight against terrorism, which was bound to be a long haul, the minister said.

He said that if 9/11 mattered to the US the most, so did the December 13 attack on Parliament. The Indian response with redeployment of the armed forces on the border, he emphasised, had had ""a salutary effect"".

It was only after this initiative that ""Islamabad came around to conceding its role in abetting terrorism. The January 12 speech of Musharraf, in my view, was impelled by Indiaâ€™s resolve, and I believe, the US is aware of this,"" Fernandes said.

Returning to the J&K elections, he told reporters on the sidelines of the FICCI meet that they could mark an end to the gun-culture spawned by 12 years of militancy.

Asked if India reserved the right to cross the Line of Control if Pakistani provocations and infiltration continued unabated, Fernandes said India would do whatever was necessary to combat terrorism.

14,Anand corporator's murder political: Cong,"AHMEDABAD: Many theories are emerging on the exact motive behind the cold-blooded murder of the former Congress president of the Anand municipality, Babubhai Girdhardas Patel, considering the strong influence he wielded in the district over the last three decades.

Insiders in the Congress believe that political equations in Anand district could change drastically with Patel''s death thus directly benefiting the BJP. Borsad MLA Bharatsinh Solanki described the murder as ''political'' and said that Patel had been receiving threats since the last four months, which he had been ignoring.

According to him, the entire Anand town had observed a voluntary bandh as a mark of respect on Tuesday. But the atmosphere was tense, said local residents.

His wife Rambha is the present president of the municipality. Patel was the president of the Anand municipality for 20 years and was also chairman of the Anand Urban Co-operative Bank.

Many local Congress leaders feel that rivalry between co-operative banks controlled by the BJP and the Congress could be one of the motives behind the ghastly murder on Monday night.

""The BJP-controlled People''s Co-operative Bank was nearly folding up on account of the scams, while the Anand Co-operative Bank was doing well,"" says the general secretary of the Anand District Congress Committee, Ulhas Patel.

""But if investigations do not proceed in the right direction, things will become worse,"" said Patel, reflecting the mood of the party workers. Inspector General of Police (Ahmedabad range) Kuldeep Sharma is already camping in Anand to supervise the investigations, sources said.

Meanwhile, the police have no clue as to who might be behind the killing as there was no eye-witness at that time in the night. The FIR, registered late in the night, does not mention about any suspect. ""Two masked men travelling in a jeep fired at him from point blank range,"" said Anand district superintendent of police B D Vaghela.

Patel was going home from his office in his Maruti car with driver Ramesh Dhobi when a jeep hit the car from behind. He got off the car and was questioning the people when they pumped three bullets into him. Solanki is sure that the BJP is behind the killing and told TNN, ""They have been doing this for quite sometime, throwing acid on our workers, kidnapping them and even the police do not dare to register cases against them.""

15,Bangalore bandh on Thursday on Cauvery issue,"BANGALORE: Even as Kannada activists prepare for a Bangalore bandh on Thursday, Chief Minister S.M. Krishna is planning meetings with opposition leaders, activists and Mandya protesters on Wednesday to explain the state''s stand.

Krishna, who declined to speak to reporters after his return from Delhi, called on former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda on Monday evening. Sources said he is planning to ask Gowda to intervene to get the protest on the Cauvery issue called off.

``It was on Gowda''s advice that Krishna agreed to release 0.8 tmcft of water to Tamil Nadu. So now he wants help to control this situation also,'''' sources added.

Meanwhile, Kannada Chaluvali leader G. Narayana Kumar claimed the support of both Janata Dal factions, BJP, Rajkumar Fans'' Association and labour unions.

The BJP had extended support to the bandh when the call was given following the Supreme Court directive to release 1.25 tmcft of water. It would be embarrassing to the party if it were to support the bandh now because that would mean opposing Prime Minister Vajpayee''s decision.

Vatal Nagaraj, who heads the Kannada Chaluvali Vatal Paksha, said his organisation is supporting the bandh. Later, he will tour the state to launch an agitation on the issue.

The state government will on Wednesday decide whether educational institutions will have a holiday on September 12, an official said.

The Kannada film industry has also extended support to the bandh. A press release said all movie shows, production work and other film activity would be stopped for the day.

17,Officials discuss voters' list issue with party representatives,"SURAT: In view of the voters'' list being an issue of contention among political parties, a meeting with representatives of parties, was called by the district administration on Monday.

The lists, which were given to political parties last month, were updated some months ago. Party representatives had urged the district administration to conduct a door-to-door survey to give a final shape to the voters'' list as the city had witnessed some exodus in recent times.

Collector MK Das, while handing over the list last month to political parties had said that the lists had been updated some time ago and that any shortcomings would be looked into. City Congress unit president Jawahar Upadhyay said the list was not final yet and needed revision.

GPCC economic cell chairman Rupin Patchigar said the list was an old one with no new incorporation or deletion.

Location of polling booths in sensitive areas was also an issue of contention among political parties. The Congress demanded that booths be set up in minority dominated areas like Azad Nagar, Gopi Talav, Bade Khan Chakla and other places. Their demand has been forwarded to the district administration.

A control room has been set up at the collectorate for verification of the list and other related matter.
