0,Hoarding rules flouted to cash in on ad rush,"MUMBAI: Hoardings may be an eyesore for citizens, but to those involved in the business, they are nothing less than a huge cash machine.

Hence, rules are often bent, laws twisted and many time simply ignored in the rush to put up more hoardings.

The anti-hoarding brigade points out that the huge profits in the business mean that trees are often cut to accommodate them and hoardings are also the reason behind the sudden proliferation of gantries and footbridges across the city.

Citizen groups, who tasted victory this week when the high court ruled that ad banners should be removed from heritage buildings, point out that the BMC could do well by removing the thousands of other hoardings hogging the cityâ€™s space.

â€œThese hoardings blatantly flout rules framed by the BMC,â€™â€™ notes senior Shiv Sena leader Pramod Navalkar. Statutes that ban hoardings at religious places and ensure that they do notjut out on roads have also been ignored.

â€œThere are hoardings near a temple between Prabhadevi and Worli. At Marine Drive and at Worli Seaface hoardings jut out on the road,â€™â€™ said Navalkar, adding that even traffic chowkis that were removed from the middle of roads following a rule in 1966, are back.

â€œAround 150 chowkis are back with glow signs. They are vacant as constables are posted 100 metres from the traffic signal but they accommodate the advertisers,â€™â€™ he said.

A former senior BMC official said if all the rules were followed there would perhaps be no hoardings left in the city. â€œThere is too much money at stake,â€™â€™ he says. For every hoarding, the BMC earns anywhere between Rs 25,000 to Rs 1 lakh per month.

â€œAnd the hoarding owner could be earning around Rs 1 lakh to Rs 10 lakh per month,â€™â€™ he added. Hoardings have become so valuable that there is â€˜maara-maariâ€™ for space at certain sought-after locations like Worli and Bandra.

â€œHoardings in these areas are also the most expensive. Advertisers also vie for space on the VIP stretchâ€” from Mantralaya to the airport and from the airport to western suburbs,â€™â€™ said the former BMC official. This is one reason why several gantries, that accommodate advertising have come up on this stretch of the Western Express Highway.

â€œOnly one-fourth of these gantries are used for signage and the rest for advertising,â€™â€™ said Anahita Pandole, who had filed the PIL against hoardings in the high court.

While about 400 hoardings in the cityâ€™s heritage precincts will go now, there are an estimated 20,000 other hoardings of varying sizes plastered on several bridges, gantries and at the sea faces across the city.

Hoardings at Mahim and at Haji Ali waterfront violate the Coastal Regulation Zone rules where concrete plinths have been sunk into the sand and huge iron pillars have been erected to support billboards at Haji Ali.

Citizens have also protested against the rash of footover-bridges, (at least 10 new ones have come up in the city).

The foot-overbridge at the Priyadarshani circle at Chunabhatti was constructed more for the advantage of the advertiser as it was a prime location for hoardings, citizens alleged.

Such hoardings cause a serious safety concern as the bridge is completely cordoned off and cannot be viewed from outside.

The bridges at Reay Road and Charni Road are now home to beggars and it is difficult for pedestrians to walk through, pointed out activists.

While rules seem shrouded in this huge business of hoardings, in some cases activists were taken aback by judgments as well. In a rather unusual judgment some time ago, the high court ruled that height of a tree at Worli junction could not be beyond 14.5 feet as it would block the hoardingâ€™s view. â€œIt can happen only in our country that trees are not being allowed to grow,â€™â€™ Navalkar says.

1,HC indicts minister for shielding two liquor firms,"NAGPUR: The Nagpur bench of the Bombay high court has indicted state excise minister Anil Deshmukh for stalling departmental action against two liquor factories owned by Ulhasnagar MLA Suresh alias Pappu Kalani and his wife Jyoti Kalani for duty evasion.

Pappu Kalani and Deshmukh both belong to the NCP, which is a partner in the ruling DF government. Jyoti is mayor of Ulhasnagar.

Significantly, while the action of the DF minister came in for criticism, the court did not spare Prakash Mehta, former excise minister in the earlier Shiv Sena-BJP government, for waiving excise dues of Rs 5.41 crore owed by another company, Konkan Agro Marine belonging to Nagpur-based liquor baron Devilal Jaiswal, in 1999.

Deshmukh, who is vacationing in the US, insisted that the judgment did not constitute a stricture against him. He said that no revenue loss had been caused to the government.

Passing its order on Wednesday, the court asked chief minister Sushilkumar Shinde to take up both matters and see to it that liqour barons as well as the high and mighty did not get away scotfree after defaulting on dues to the state.

The indictment â€œof the sorry state of affairsâ€™â€™ in the state government was passed by a division bench comprising Justice Jaynarayan Patel and Justice Bhushan Dharmadhikari while hearing a public interest petition by social worker Ram Pandey on evasion of excise duty by liqour barons.

The court, while expressing anguish over the blatant misuse of power by Deshmukh, reminded the CM that it was his constitutional duty to protect honest officers and punish the guilty, irrespective of their political affiliations.

4,SP to play key role in govt formation: Mulayam,"DATIA, Madhya Pradesh: Predicting a hung Parliament, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister and Samajwadi Party supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav on Saturday said that his party would play a key role in government formation by strengthening the third force, together with parties opposed to the BJP.

Firmly ruling out any understanding with the BJP-led NDA or the Congress in the event of a fractured verdict, Yadav told reporters at Sevda near here that ""no single party is going to secure majority in the elections and Samajwadi Party will play a significant role in the formation of government at the Centre"".

Taking strong exception to Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee describing the BJP and SP as like-minded parties, Yadav said that the saffron party should either get a mosque built at Ayodhya or wait for the court verdict and comply with it.

He added that a meeting of all political parties opposed to both Congress and BJP would be held in New Delhi after the election to examine ways and means of strengthening the third force.

Earlier addressing an election meeting at Sevda under Bhind Lok Sabha constituency, Yadav described BJP and Congress as his enemies and accused the two parties of spreading ''rumours'' in an attempt to derive electoral benefit.

He charged the BJP with getting appeals issued by Muslim leaders in its favour in a bid to mislead members of the minority community.

Ridiculing Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani''s reported statement on holding Assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh three months after the Lok Sabha polls, he said that SP had 195 members in the state Assembly and is backed by 249 MLAs.
