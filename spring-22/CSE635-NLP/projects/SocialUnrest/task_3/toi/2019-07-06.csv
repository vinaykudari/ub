0,Article 356 may be imposed for Assembly polls,"Lucknow: In 1998, the then Chief Election Commissioner MS Gill had floated the idea of holding assembly polls under Presidentâ€™s rule for ensuring fairness. Everyone, including the opposition, had shot down the idea. Four years later, even the ruling coalition would not mind following the suggestion.

Now, emboldened by Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee dropping broad hints to impose Central rule in Jammu and Kashmir to ensure free and fair polls, the Election Commission (EC) is contemplating seeking amendments in the Constitution and Representation of Peopleâ€™s Act (RPA) to ensure that assembly polls be held under Presidentâ€™s rule.

Already working on poll reforms, the Prime Ministerâ€™s statement has come as a shot in the arm for the commission. A senior EC official told TNN on phone that the commission is in touch with the government and the opposition to seek their opinion on the contentious issue. â€œThe response is encouraging and we do hope that some positive steps would be taken in this regard,â€� said the official.

The official disclosed that former law minister Arun Jaitely was not averse to the idea. Part of electoral reforms, if certain amendments are made in Article 356 and the RPA and the suggestion floated by Gill four years ago and taken up by the prime minister, may see the light of the day soon.

â€œPolls in Jammu and Kashmir are a challenge for both the commission and the Centre. The world would be watching India. The commission has adequate paraphernalia and powers to ensure such polls but still there are few things which negate efforts of the commission,â€� points the official.

The commission has suggested the Bangladesh model for holding all elections in the country. In the neighbouring country, the President steps down before polls to ensure sanctity and fairness. â€œWhen it can be implemented in a country like Bangladesh, why not in India?â€� quipped the official.

â€œPolitical parties are so restless and power-hungry that they go to any extent for ensuring their victory in the polls. This tendency results in clash of interests. The EC employees on poll duties are intimidated. In such a situation, commission finds it difficult to cope with the pressure on its staff,â€� candidly admitted the official.

The official gave the example of assembly polls in Kunda in Pratapgarh where elections had to be countermanded following large-scale complaints. Elections were held again along with the by-polls recently. Incidentally, the then CEC Gill had floated the suggestion in 1998 in Lucknow after banning entry of the then minister Raghuraj Pratap Singh alias Raja Bhaiyya. The commission also gave examples of holding free and fair assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh and again in 1996 under Presidentâ€™s rule to cement its claims and urgency for amendments in the Constitution and the RPA.

The commission hopes that a new beginning could be made during the J&K polls if the NDA government has some political will. The Centre can enact these amendments and get an approval from Parliament during the coming session as the opposition is also amenable to the suggestion.

1,Pension to farm workers before Onam,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Labour minister Babu Divakaran on Friday informed the assembly that one installment of pension to agriculture workers would be paid before the Onam festival in August.

Replying to a calling attention to the necessity to distribute the benefits envisaged in the Kerala Agriculture Workers Welfare Fund Scheme, Divakaran said steps also would be taken to distribute the welfare fund amount of Rs 5000 each to workers who attained 60 years, who were members of the scheme, this week.

An amount of Rs 1 crore has been sanctioned for the purpose, he said.

Admitting that there was a wide gap between the collection towards the fund and expenses, Divakaran said there was a need for re-organisation of the scheme.

The workers join the scheme only when they attain 57 years and would pay only Rs 300 to 400 as their contribution, he said. The cess amount to be collected from the landlords towards the scheme was also not collected properly. The cess collection has improved now slightly, he said.

A total of 18 lakh workers were members of the scheme and Rs 5000 has to be paid to 72,000 members now, he said.

2,CRZ rules waived to clear golf course,"MUMBAI: The Union environment ministry and the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) have already cleared the construction of an 18-hole golf course on 550 acres of land behind Millat Nagar housing society in Andheri.

Environmentalists and activists from non-governmental organisations said they were shocked to hear this admission by government officials during an inspection of the site last Saturday. As reported by this newspaper two months ago, local residents have complained that several hundred eco-sensitive mangroves have been chopped down by the developer as the land was reclaimed to build the controversial golf course.

They contend that the proposed golf course falls under the coastal regulation zone (CRZ) 1,which prohibits any kind of construction in mangrove enclaves. The golf complex is being developed by Usha Madhu Cooperative Development Housing Society, which has entered into an agreement with the Behramji Jeejeebhoy group, which owns the land. Principal secretary (environment and energy) Ravi Buddhiraja told TNN that the Central government had given the green signal for the project last year.

Subsequently, the building proposal department of the BMC had also passed the plans. â€œWe have received complaints that this land had mangroves, which were hacked. We are looking into these complaints and it will be discussed in the next state CRZ authority meeting,â€™â€™ Mr Buddhiraja said. He observed that if these complaints were found to be true, the state government should inform the Union environment ministry about it. Only the ministry has the power to revoke its permission.

The site inspection consisted of officials from the state environment department, suburban collectorâ€™s office, the BMC, the pollution control board and members of environmental groups like Save Mangroves-Save Mumbai and Bombay Environmental Action Group (BEAG). â€œThe BMCâ€™s development-plan sheet, which was shown to us, clearly shows that the land on which the golf complex is coming up falls under CRZ 1,â€™â€™ said BEAGâ€™s Debi Goenka.

â€œWhen we asked civic officials as to how the BMC had given permission under such circumstances, they had no answer,â€™â€™ he said. Deputy municipal commissioner Vikram Pawar,who was present during the inspection tour, said he did not know much as the permission had been granted by the building proposal department. Mr Goenka observed that the BMC or the state government should have immediately informed the Central government about the CRZ violations. â€œSuburban collector C.S. Sangitrao has clearly told some of us that we are just wasting our time making these complaints.

According to him, there are no CRZ violations anywhere in the suburbs,â€™â€™ said Pravin Choudhary, a local activist. Mr Sangitrao was not available for comment.

3,Privilege notice against co-operation minister,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: CPM member A K Balan has given notice to the assembly speaker against Co-operation minister M V Raghavan for breach of privilege for `misinforming'' the house while replying to the Pariyaram Medical College bill.

In his notice, Balan said Raghavan had misled the house by pointing out that the Kerala State Co-operative Hospital Complex (KSCHC) at Pariyaram was in possession of the 48.1562 hectare land in which the medical college was situated.

He said the high court had in 1994 nullified the assigning of 48.1562 hectares of land to the medical college. The minister had himself later stated in the house that the government had filed an appeal in the court on the land issue.

He said the minister''s statement in the house was against facts and sought the Speaker''s permission to raise the matter as a privilege issue.

4,Ban on Ayodhya film evokes protests in Kerala,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: A ban on the exhibition of director Anand Patwardhan''s controversial documentary on the Ayodhya temple-mosque issue in a Kerala district with a large Muslim presence has evoked strong protests.

The screening of Patwardhan''s ""Ram Ke Nam Par"", which was filmed in 1990 before Hindu zealots destroyed the Babri mosque in Ayodhya and examines the realities that ultimately led to its demolition, has been banned in the Malappuram district.

The ban on the 1990 national award winning film, which has been telecast by state-owned Doordarshan television network during the same period, first came into effect June 11 for 15 days.

As soon as the period expired, the local administration further extended the ban on the film''s screening reportedly because of fears that it could upset the fragile peace in the communally sensitive district.

Former MLA and leading filmmaker P.T. Kunjumohammed told IANS it was wrong of the authorities to ban the screening. ""I don''t know the rationale behind the decision because this very same documentary was screened on Doordarshan and also in several parts of Kerala.

""This decision would invite a strong backlash from the people.""

A daylong meeting at Malappuram Thursday, where several writers, filmmakers, poets and cartoonists took part, strongly condemned the district administration''s role and vowed to thwart the ban by launching a mass campaign.

Kerala Education Minister Nalakath Soopy, who hails from Malappuram, told IANS he felt the ban would help cool down tempers which were raised due to the volatile Ram temple issue.

Hindu hardliners wish to build a Ram temple on the site of the Babri mosque.

""Just seeing the film, hardliners from both communities could whip up passion and peace could be a problem,"" said Soopy.

Former legislator T.K. Hamza asked the Indian Union Muslim League to spell out its stand on the issue and said that the decision to ban the film in Malappuram was part of a concerted attempt to depict the district in a bad light.

The film was banned by district officials after the activists of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the rightwing Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and Hindu Jagranvedi protested against its screening.

Chief Minister A.K. Antony''s office said the district collector has the powers to take a decision to maintain peace in the region. ""There is no need for any political clearance for that. It is the duty of the district administration to maintain peace,"" an official in his office said.

6,Pavement dwellers’ clash leaves two dead,"NEW DELHI: Two persons were killed and three injured when two groups clashed near Pracheen Hanuman Mandir in north Delhi on Thursday night. The incident took place in a park near the temple. â€˜â€˜A group of pavement dwellers sleep in the park,â€™â€™ said a police officer.

The victims later told the police six persons, armed with rods, chains and knives, went to the park and woke up Ashok, a rickshawpuller. â€˜â€˜The assailants wanted to know the whereabouts of a man called Bombaiyya. When Ashok pleaded ignorance, they attacked him,â€™â€™ the officer said.

The assailants reportedly attacked anyone they could lay their hands on. When they could not find Bombaiyya, the assailants left. The injured were taken to Sushruta Trauma Centre.

Two of the injured, one of whom was identified as Sanjay (22), died. The police are trying to establish the identity of the other victim. The three injured have been identified as Sanjay, Ashok and Mukarram.

A case of murder and attempted murder has been registered by the police in Kashmiri Gate. According to the police, investigations indicated the assailants were probably pavement dwellers who lived near the Kashmiri Gate inter-state bus terminal (ISBT). â€˜â€˜It seems some of the men from ISBT had a tiff with Bombaiyya who lived near Hanuman Mandir. But what the original tiff was about is yet to be ascertained,â€™â€™ said an officer.

Most of the people involved in the fight, said police officers, were unemployed. â€˜â€˜Many of them are drug addicts. They occasionally take to pulling rickshaws to earn. At other times, some of them resort to petty offences, like theft and snatching,â€™â€™ said the officer.

While initially there was a possibility the fight might have been sparked by selling or sharing of drugs among the groups, senior police officials said investigations so far have not suggested drugs were the cause of the clash.

Officials said they have identified Bombaiyya and were looking for him. They have also identified some of the assailants and a search is on for them as well. â€˜â€˜What provoked the fight will become clear once these people are nabbed and questioned,â€™â€™ the officer said.

7,Cambodian government honours Puneite,"PUNE: On June 17, 2002, the Royal Government of Cambodia conferred its highest honour for foreigners, Commander of Sahamitra, on Puneite Ramanathan Natarajan.

An ex-IAS officer,Natarajan is the first Indian to receive the coveted title for bringing about socio-economic reforms in Cambodia. â€œWhen the entire world had ostracised Cambodia, India and the Soviet Block were the only two countries who were neutral towards them,â€� said Natarajan, who played a crucial role in helping the Cambodian Government in drafting their first five-year plan in 1995.

â€œNearly three lakh people lived in refugee camps.We had to inform the rest of the world the hardships faced by these people,â€� said Natarajan. In 1992, with the help of the Japanese government, he organised the first ever major international donorsâ€™ meeting in Tokyo. â€œThe meeting fetched the war-ravaged country nearly $ 880 million,â€� exclaimed Natarajan. Realising the exigency to uplift the country on a socio-economic front, Natarajan drafted socio-economic policies for the government.

â€œCambodia depended more on foreign investments. Hence, after doing a comprehensive study with other agencies, I drafted the socioeconomic policies for the government. Within the first three years, taxation doubled. Likewise, investments in the health and education sectors also tripled,â€� said a proud Natarajan.

Born and bred in Tamil Nadu, Natarajan joined the Life Insurance Corporation, Pune in 1956. Six months down the line, he was selected and called for the IAS officersâ€™ training in Delhi. â€œDelhi did me a world of good. Thatâ€™s where, I met my wife, Nalini who too was undergoing her IAS training. In fact, she was the first IAS lady assistant collector for Pune in 1958-59,â€� Natarajan said. Post-retirement life has brought the 68-year old Natarajan back to his bungalow on Law College road. â€œI like the weather and the slow lifestyle here,â€� he said.

From 1957 to 1982, Natarajan was in the IAS service in various capacities. In 1982, Natarajan joined the United Nations (UN) as representative of the United Nations Population Fund in Western Samoa. Later in 1989, he was appointed chief of South-East Asia division of the United Nations Development Programme.Even after his retirement in 1999 as the first Resident Representative of the World Bank in Phnom Penh, Natarajan continues his correspondence with the Cambodian government at assists it all levels. The award conferred on him reads, â€˜Commander of the Order of True Friendshipâ€™.

8,Auto-lifting just a nuisance by law,"NEW DELHI: Many police officers predict that in the years to come, auto-lifting will become one of the most lucrative crimes in Delhi.

They also caution that combating this crime will become increasingly difficult given that neither does the Delhi Police have resources nor do laws have sufficient bite.

â€˜â€˜First of all, stealing a car is not a serious crime. Many courts consider it more of a nuisance rather than a crime. Getting bail is extremely easy and even those criminals who are arrested rarely spend more than a couple of months in jail at a stretch,â€™â€™ said a police officer.

Compare this â€˜â€˜professional hazardâ€™â€™ to the kind of money involved in the crime. A car thief is likely to make between Rs 20,000 and Rs 60,000 depending on the carâ€™s make. If he can steal four or five cars a month, the risk is definitely worth taking.

Proving guilt in court is even more difficult. For one, most stolen cars are whisked out of Delhi and seldom recovered. In many cases forged documents are used to re-register the vehicle in a distant state. The car is re-registered and sold as a second-hand vehicle with genuine papers.

â€˜â€˜We suspect officials of the state transport authorities in several states, particularly Jammu and Kashmir and some northeastern states, are conniving with car thieves and helping them register their vehicles. Many people who bought stolen cars with genuine registration papers have moved court against the recovery of their vehicles,â€™â€™ the officer said.

It is also very difficult to connect a car thief to all the car thefts he may have committed. â€˜â€˜Even if arrested while driving a stolen car, we can connect a criminal with only one case of theft. Most courts donâ€™t attach too much importance to cars recovered later at the accusedâ€™s instance,â€™â€™ the officer added.

9,Tougher law on dishonoured cheques soon,"NEW DELHI: The Union Cabinet on Friday decided to introduce a legislation for enhancing punishment for dishonouring cheques and ensure time-bound disposal of cases.

Meeting for the first time after it was revamped on Monday, the Cabinet also decided to move official amendments to the Companies (Second Amendment) Bill, 2001, pending in the Lok Sabha, to add a provision to enable the existing directors in inter-state cooperative societies to continue in office for one year from the date of transformation of the society into a producer company.

The government will withdraw the Negotiable Instruments Act (Amendment) Bill introduced in the Lok Sabha on July 24, 2001, and will table a fresh Bill to tighten the provisions dealing with bounced cheques.

The Information Technology Act, 2000, will also be made applicable to an electronic image of a truncated cheque and an electronic cheque, information and broadcasting minister Sushma Swaraj told reporters after the Cabinet meeting.

â€œThe present provisions in the NIA have been found to be inadequate in dealing with the menace resulting from dishonour of the cheque,â€� she said. The punishment period will be enhanced from one year imprisonment to two years.

Swaraj said for speedy disposal of cases relating to bounced cheques, a provision will be made for setting a time limit of six months for disposal of cases. There will be summary trial and day-to-day hearing. The courts will be empowered to waive the cognizance period of one month for any complaint in order to accelerate the process.

In a move that will help promote tourism between India and China, the Cabinet ratified an agreement signed during the visit of Chinese premier Zhu Rongji here early this year.

10,CPDCL snaps govt's power supply,"HYDERABAD: In the first real taste of what privatisation of the power sector can be all about, the Central Power Dis-tribution Company Limited (CPDCL), in a major revenue recovery exercise, snapped power supply to as many as 200 central and state government departments and undertakings for the past two days.

Central government undertakings like IDPL, HMT, Praga Tools and state government departments and establishments â€” Hyderabad Metropolitan Wa-ter Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB), Lalita Kala Toranam, Hy-derabad Municipal Corporation offices in circle IV and V, horticulture office in Public Gardens, Narayanguda flyover, Chanchalguda prison, Gandhi hospital â€” were some of the many to whom CPDCL discontinued power supply on Thursday and Friday.

Justifying the exercise, CPDCL director (finance) C Srinivas Rao said his company had served notices to all the departments several times to clear their dues, but the electricity dues from them only kept mounting.

While various government officials and ministers criticised CPDCLâ€™s action, chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu came to the rescue of the compa-ny and reportedly justified the action.

According to sources, one of the sen-ior CPDCL officials went to the Secretariat on Thursday to give the informa-tion that power supply to the seat of the government could also be snapped as the Secretariat owes CPDCL Rs 35 lakh.

The sources said the CPDCL official was mobbed by a group of officials and ministers and harassed for snapping power supply to HMWS&SB and Chan-chalguda prison on Thursday.

The incident came to the notice of Naidu who was passing by.

The chief minister intervened in the discussion and gave the official the assurance that the pending electricity bills of the Sec-retariat would soon be paid.

It was learnt that the chief minister also said that CPDCL should have begun its rev-enue recovery act from the Secretariat to set an example for everyone else.

Rao said there were more than 400 government departments which had not paid their electricity dues for years.

The financial burden on CPDCL can be gathered from the fact that it has to get a whopping Rs 75 crore from various state government departments in the city alone.

This accounts for about 95 per cent of the dues the company needs to recover from government depart-ments in the districts served by CPDCL.

The departments which owe major amounts to the company include â€” irri-gation command area division: Rs 14.65 crore; education department: Rs 1.4 crore; municipal administration and ur-ban development: Rs 2.76 crore; home department: Rs 4.04 crore and health, family welfare: Rs 3.42 crore.

The cen-tral government IDPL has to pay Rs 31 crore and Praga Tools about Rs 10 lakh. Rao said they were disconnecting sup-ply from the poles to prevent the users from restoring supply on their own.

11,Students protest reservation policy,"HYDERABAD: Students from various colleges in the twin cities expressed their resent-ment against increasing in-equalities in society and child marriages, and main-tained that their future would be at stake if the reser-vation policy is continued.

About 200 students from various colleges in the twin cities participated in the open forum hosted for college students by the AP Womenâ€™s Commission at Buddha Bha-van here on Friday.

Inaugu-rating the open forum, the first lady of the state Haripriya Rangarajan urged the youth to come forward to express their ideas and voice their opinion.

She said a theme would be selected at the introductory session, and that would be discussed at the next meet, which will be held next month.

Open fo-rums for students will be held every month, she said.

A student from Bhadruka College, Sanjog K Jain ques-tioned the logic behind seek-ing information on religion and caste of the candidate seeking admission to an in-stitution or for a government job. He said such a system has only created divisions in society.

He said it was time reservations in the name of caste, religion, and women are done away with.

The problems of youth and the status of women were sug-gested by him as topics for the next meet. Another stu-dent from the same college, Harsh Jain, also argued for an egalitarian society. A student from Osmania University, S Archana, ex-pressed the need for equal op-portunities to all students, ir-respective of their economic and social background.

She said child marriages were rampant in society.

12,"Andhra govt, Naxalite talks in jeopardy","HYDERABAD: The Peopleâ€™s War emissaries â€”Varavara Rao and Balladeer Gaddar â€” have withdrawn from the talks with the government to find a solution to the Naxal problem protesting against the â€˜â€˜fake encounters and police oppressionâ€™â€™ during the cease fire period, unilaterally declared by the PW and because they â€˜â€˜lost linkâ€™â€™ with the cadre of PW.

At a Press conference on Saturday, they said that their role in the peace mission came to an end soon after the third round of talks on June 20. The continuing fake encounters on the PW cadre when they were maintaining cease fire shows that the government was not sincere in attaining a peaceful solution.

Demanding judicial enquiry into the Nerella encounter on July 2, and other encounters in Warangal, Karimnagar and Warangal districts, they wanted the government to book cases under Section 302 against the police personnel involved in the encounters. They further demanded that a monitoring committee be constituted to help create a conducive atmosphere for talks.

13,Hussain censures HRD ministers,"PATNA: Chairman of the Bihar Legislative Council Prof Jabir Hussain censured the two HRD ministers for their contradictory statements over the procedure of appointment of secondary school teachers and its headmasters.

The chairman after heated debate during the question hour session in the pre-lunch council session, said there was discrepency in the government reply which denigrates parliamentary tradition.

He asked the ministers to furnish detailed information about the specific date of appointment of secondary teachers from the panel set up to appoint them.

The controversy began when minister of state for secondary education Ram Prakash Mahto, while replying to a starred question of CPIâ€™s Kedar Pandey, said that a written examination will be held to appoint teachers in the secondary schools.

There are 6,640 posts of secondary teachers and 1,350 posts of headmasters lying vacant in Bihar, he added.

Basudeo Singh (CPM), Neelamber Chaudhary, Kumari Jyoti, Mahachandra Prasad Singh (Cong), Nawal Kishore Yadav, Bhola Prasad Singh (RJD) and Vijay K Verma, JD(U) said that the government has already prepared a panel of teachers in four subjects but till date no appointments have been made.

Intervening minister for primary education, Ram Chandra Purbey said that the CM is concerned about the delay in appointment of secondary teachers, adding she will hold a meeting with senior officials and ministers to discuss large-scale vacancies. Purbey also said that the promotion of headmasters will be done within six months. Appointment of teachers will be done through open advertisement.

Due to technical reasons, it has been delayed, he added.

Primary teachers: The state government has decided to appoint 17,000 primary teachers within six months. Purbey, during a short-notice question of Prof Arun Kumar in the council, said that there are 1.47 lakh sanctioned posts of primary teachers in which 1.30 lakh are working. The remaining 17,000 are lying vacant which would be filled up in six months.

15,NGO man arrested for forgery,"BOLANGIR: Satya Narayan Bohidar of Rajiv Udyog, a Titlagarh-based NGO, has been arrested by the Kantabanji police for allegedly forging former Bolangir collectorâ€™s signature.

Bohidar has been remanded to jail custody after his bail was rejected. A case has been registered against him.

According to a report from Muribahal block, Rajiv Udyog was entrusted with the digging of 120 ring wells in the block. The NGO was even paid for 88 wells. Payment of 32 wells was held by the district administration as work was not up to mark.

Over production has had a negative effect on their produce. They now plan to use traditional and indigenous seed in place of high yielding paddy varieties as the theory of over production causing harm to economy has directly effected them.

They produce more but get less, beat their heads before the millers, succumb to the blackmailing of middlemen and depend on the mercy of arrogant bureaucrats to sell their hard-earned products.

18,Godhra court acquits 9 riot-accused,"GODHRA: A Godhra court has acquitted nine persons, accused in a case of burning and destruction of shops in Lunawada town in Panchmahal district, for lack of evidence.

The incident had taken place on February 27, a few hours after the Godhra train massacre. Sources said the accused were let off following a compromise struck between the shop-keepers and the accused. Significantly, the local BJP MP Bhupendrasinh Solanki was the defence counsel in the case assisted by a panel of lawyers.

Police said the accused had been arrested immediately after the incident from the spot of the crime even though they maintained that they were not involved in any violence.

All the witnesses in the case, apart from the policemen, turned hostile in the court during the hearings because of the compromise. Delivering the judgment in just four months after the incident, additional district and sessions judge Viral Desai, acquitted them observing that the prosecution had failed to prove charges against them in connection with the February 27 incident.

She observed that the case cannot stand merely on the evidence provided by the police and there was a need for independent eye-witnesses to substantiate the police statement.

19,Duty on silk may increase,"BANGALORE: The Centre is thinking of increasing import duty on raw silk from the present 35 per cent, newly appointed Union Minister of State for Textiles Basanagoud R Patil Yatnal said on Saturday.

Addressing his maiden news conference after assuming office on Friday, Yatnal said the Centre will make an announcement about this soon, though the quantum of the hike hasn''t been finalised. His senior Textiles Minister Kashiram Rana had already discussed the issue with officials and the government is all set to come out with relief measures.

He admitted that import of cheap raw silk from China is hurting the domestic industry. ``Time has now come to take a clear stand on the issue. We will have to help them.''''

An MP from Bijapur, Yatnal said his immediate priority is to address problems faced by sericulturists and weavers. Indian sericulturists must be updated with the latest technology to compete internationally.

``Since we cannot escape World Trade Organisation (WTO) restrictions, we should encourage local silk industry to compete in the international market. The government would come out with some restrictive policies to stop the dumping of Chinese raw silk,'''' Yatnal said.

Chief Minister SM Krishna had sought a hike in import duty to 60 per cent as Karnataka accounts for more than 60 per cent of the country''s silk production.

Yatnal said he would not limit his activities to that of a Central Minister but would pursue Karnataka projects pending with the Centre. ``I will meet Chief Minister SM Krishna and hold discussions about the projects,'''' he added.
