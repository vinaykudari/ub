0,Near-total bandh in state's minority areas,"AHMEDABAD: The call to boycott the bandh by clerics of the minority community went virtually unheeded in areas of Ahmedabad and South Gujarat when the bandh call given by the lesser-known Mustafa Raza Academy evoked a near-total response on Monday.

Stray incidents of violence were reported from Bharuch district after a mob robbed a petrol station of Rs 20,000 when trying to force its owners to shut shop. Police dispersed the mob with lathi-charge and lobbed a tear-gas shell, SP V Vasava said.

In Ahmedabad too, police chased groups that had tried to down shutters in the Karanj and Shahpur areas. While most minority-dominated areas of the city remained closed, Bharuch witnessed a total bandh, called to protest Christian preacher Jerry Falwellâ€™s remarks about Prophet Mohammed.

Minority-dominated areas of Mehsana, Kheda, Anand, Sabarkantha, Junagadh, Nadiad and Patan also remained closed. Surprisingly, the bandh had no impact in the communally sensitive districts of the Panchmahals and Dahod. In Modasa, where violence was reported on Sunday, a section of Muslims decided to boycott the bandh call.

According to intelligence reports, the bandh was near-total in the Vijapur, Kasba and Haideri chowk areas of Mehsana, while Kadi was unaffected. In Junagadh, the Prabhas Patan area was completely closed, while Nadiad and Kheda towns along with the Khambhat and Mahudha areas of heeded the call. The bandh was total in Anandâ€™s Petlad town. It failed to affect the border districts of Kutch and Banaskantha.

The Sarkhej area of Ahmedabad observed a complete bandh, while there was a partial response in the other minority-dominated areas of the city with shops remaining closed. Trade in the Walled City areas, however, came to a standstill.

Commuters were left high and dry as AMTS buses remained off the roads. The usually bustling Relief Road, Teen Darwaja and Kalupur Tower wore a deserted look.

For the likes of Raju Patel, a resident of Gandhinagar, the long rows of downed shutters at Teen Darwaja area came as a shock. ""Is anything wrong? Has trouble started again,"" he asked passers-by.

A tailor in the Teen Darwaja area, Abdul Majid, said: ""I donâ€™t know what this bandh is for. Around 11 am all the neighbouring shops closed down, so I followed suit.""

The imam of the Jama Masjid at Pankore Naka, Mufti Shabbirahmed Siddiqui, said: ""Gauging the delicate peace, I had asked members of my community to refrain from calling this bandh.""

Siddiqui, who is also the chairman of All-Gujarat Muslim Federation, added ""But certain elements unnecessarily propagated this bandh call. The masses got cowed down.""

But, Siddiquiâ€™s concerns are not shared by Abdul Rasid Razvi of the Mustafa Raza Academy. Police officials said Razvi was primarily responsible for giving the call.

Razvi said, ""If they (the religious leaders) fail to condemn the use of blasphemous language against our Prophet then somebody has to take up this responsibility.""

For the retailers across the city, the bandh call came as another blow. Suraj Kalra, a fruit vendor near the Dariapur Darwaja said: ""Eversince February 28, business just refuses to return to normal. Bandhs should be banned from Gujarat in the interest of stateâ€™s economy.""

1,Security tightened for Sena's Dussehra rally,"MUMBAI: The state has ordered unprecedented security on Tuesday for Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray''s traditional Dasera rally in Shivaji Park.

This follows intelligence reports that the Kashmiri terrorist organisation, Jaish-e-Mohammed, may strike at the rally.

A five-member suicide squad is believed to have slipped into the city. Recently, two terrorists indiscriminately opened fire at the Akshardham temple at Gandhinagar in Gujarat, killing several devotees.

The Rapid Action Force and several units of the State Reserve Police will be deployed around the venue. Senior police officials supervised the security arrangements on Monday evening.

The entire maidan will be secured several hours before the rally starts, at 6.00 p.m. Armed policemen will be posted atop many of the buildings that skirt the maidan and security personnel aboard an helicopter also will keep watch.

The route from Mr Thackeray''s bungalow in Bandra to Shivaji Park will be heavily guarded. The Sena has been asked by the police to ensure that its ranks are not infiltrated by strangers. Several city lodges were searched on Monday as a precautionary measure.

Security is also being beefed up for the RSS Dasera rally in Nagpur.

2,"Post polls, India cringes as Pak finds acceptance","NEW DELHI: With the international community attributing greater credibility to the Pakistan government in the wake of the just-concluded elections, India has an important diplomatic test ahead of it now.

Pakistan had been isolated after the military coup. But the recent election process has, overall, received a favourable response.

Of considerable significance are the renewed efforts to reconsider Pakistan''s suspension from the Councils of the Commonwealth.

It had been suspended after the military coup led by Musharraf.

While the European Union team was strident in its criticism of the poll process, terming them ""seriously flawed"", the Commonwealth observers'' team has adopted a more balanced its approach.

The Commonwealth observers team in Pakistan said at its conclusion that the elections were ""for the most transparent"", even though there were doubts on whether there was a truly level playing field.

""While our observers encountered a number of irregularities and disturbances, we received no major complaints from polling agents and on the whole, what we observed was an orderly and peaceful process,"" the head of the team, Tan Sri Dato Musa bin Hitam, said in a statement.

The US was unrestraint in its praise for the elections. White House spokesperson Ari Fleischer said the US welcomed the multi-party national and provincial elections, describing them as an ""important milestone in Pakistan''s ongoing transition to democracy"".

India, which has stated that it feels the results of Pakistan''s elections have been rendered unfair before the process because of the measures designed to control candidature and the appropriation of powers by President Musharraf, may find the going uphill in its attempts to convince the international community not to see the elections as a major step towards democracy.

While Indian officials feel there is a long way to go between observation and recommending action, it is evident that the validity of the polling process has been accepted at one level.

""It is too early,"" said one official of any moves to reward Pakistan, adding that India would not be lagging behind in pointing out various lacunae in the electoral process.

These include the changes in the rules, the counting process, the delimitation of constituencies, the clause barring non-graduates from participation and incomplete lists.

""We are also in the Commmonwealth,"" an official said cryptically in response to suggestions that the process of lifting the suspension maybe begun soon.

While India would try to block any such move, the officials also admitted that they would not be surprised if there were suggestions along these lines from some members of the Commonwealth.

""After all, Pakistan remains a ''stalwart ally'',"" says an official.

3,Stamps case fails to get govt. into preventive mode,"PUNE: Although four months have passed since the fake stamp paper racket was busted, the state government has failed to implement any of the measures it had promised to avoid recurrence of such a scandal.

Soon after the Pune police busted the multi-crore scandal in June, deputy chief minister Chhagan Bhujbal had called a meeting of police and revenue department officials.

It was decided that stamp papers and other stamps, including court-fee stamps, brokerage stamps and insurance stamps, would be sold through post offices and banks.

It was also decided at the meeting that franking machines would be installed at all sub-registrar offices where land documents are registered and that holograms would be attached to stamp papers.

However, none of the above measures have so far been implemented. A senior official from the revenue department told TNN, ""Currently, we are debating the percentage of the commission we would require to pay to the posts and telegraph department and banks if the stamps are sold through them.""

The official said the decision to purchase franking machines and introduce stamp papers with holograms was still awaiting clearance from secretaries and ministers. Out of over 300 sub-registrar''s offices in the state, only 137 offices had franking machines, he revealed.

Inspector-general of registrations and stamp duties Nitin Karir said the issue of commission needed to be sorted out. ""The decision to sell stamp papers through banks and post offices will take around six months because issues like commission are to be sorted out. Besides, the central government''s clearance would also be required,"" he said.

On introducing holograms for stamp papers, Karir said the government wants to be absolutely sure before taking such a step. ""We are going in for holograms based on the molecular imaging technique. Currently, this technology is only available with an Israeli company"".

Karir said an order for 100 franking machines would be placed within a day or two.

4,All-party meet to discuss water crisis on Wednesday,"HYDERABAD: The state government will convene an all party meeting on Wednesday to discuss the water crisis in the state. This decision was taken here at a meeting chaired by the chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu on Monday.

The meeting decided to postpone the visit of the irrigation department officials to Karnataka till the all-party meeting was over. The government, said major irrigation minister Kadiam Srihari, will apprise the opposition parties about the existing situation in regard to availability of water for irrigation and seek their opinion in handling the situation.

According to the minister, there has been a marginal increase in inflow into reservoirs following consistent rains during past three days.

The government hopes that the situation would further ease if the state has rains in next two or three days. While the government was worried over zero inflows into Srisailam, it has now heaved a sigh of relief as the recent rains have helped the reservoir get fresh inflows.

6,Meeting on power tariff for farm sector today,"CHANDIGARH: The crucial meeting, during which reversing the decision on rolling back free power to agriculture sector, and imposition of a new power tariff as recommended by Punjab State Power Regulatory Commission has finally been slated for Wednesday.

If all goes well, and the cabinet meeting is not deferred as has been in the past, and the cabinet arrives at a unanimous decision, the farmers would be deprived of the bonanza which they enjoyed throughout the SAD-BJP rule in Punjab.

The grim financial situation could frighten the minister into submitting the proposal of re-imposing a power tariff on the farm sector and hiking the in the industrial and domestic sector also.

The cabinet would discuss the financial state of the state and the governmentâ€™s presentation on the reduction of expenditure would also be taken up.

The significance of the issue can also be gauged from the fact that it will be taken up at the meeting convened by the Prime Minister later this week on Friday.

All other items earlier on the agenda of the meeting have been dropped perhaps with the objective of focusing on the main issue of re-introduction of the power tariff on the farm sector.

The financial crisis remains though the slide has been checked to a large extent. The stateâ€™s income has remained static.

Its tax revenue was Rs 2865 crore in the first five months of financial year till August 31 compared to receipt of Rs 2759 crore for the corresponding period last year. But this year, receipts including social security surcharges 10 per cent on sales tax have remained same.

There is substantial increase of Rs 25 crore under the stamp and duties head while the transport sector has registered a decrease Rs 5 crore.

Proceeds from excise and taxation are reportedly the same though the sales tax revenue has swelled from Rs 1089 crore to Rs 1193 crore owing to inclusion of the social security surcharge.

The good news was that the government spending on education increased by Rs crore.

On the reduction of expenditure, the government is to make up its mind on 12 issues which would be taken up at the PM meeting with chief ministers.

7,Badal's arrest will have serious repercussions: Dhindsa,"SANGRUR: Union minister Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa said on Tuesday that if chief minister Amarinder Singh dared to arrest former chief minister and Shiromani Akali Dal president Parkash Singh Badal then it would have serious repercussions and Amarinder would have to take its entire responsibility.

Addressing a congregation at Ghunas village in Barnala sub-division of the district, Dhindsa gave a clarion call to the Akali cadre to come on roads to register their peaceful protest in case Badal was arrested.

He warned the chief minister ""not to play with electric wiresâ€™â€™ and recalled that any of the previous Congress chief ministers who dared to confront with the panthic parties were costed them dearly. He also warned that if the peace in the state was disturbed after Badalâ€™s arrest then the Amarinder government would have to shoulder its entire responsibility.

He dubbed Amarinder-Ravi Inder Singh (former speaker)-GS Tohra (former SGPC chief) as ""caucus bent upon to take over the reins of the SGPC with unfair means to install Gurcharan Singh Tohra as its chief"".

10,Miss Tibet contest brainchild of western lobbies?,"DHARAMSALA: Was the Miss Tibet beauty contest a ploy to gain sympathy for the Tibetan cause and project China in bad light? Were lobbies in western countries behind the organisation of the contest? These questions have been doing the rounds since the completion of the first-ever Tibetan beauty contest.

Experts on Tibetan affairs feel that the international community, like USA and UK, have not been able to pressurise China into resolving the Tibetan problem due to their own political and economic compulsions.

They maintained that young Tibetans, guided primarily by prominent personalities of the west who have taken to Buddhism, were the one''s to come up with the idea of staging the contest.

Sources added that followers of Buddhism and the Dalai Lama, including Hollywood stars like Richard Gere and Goldie Hawn, had been working consistently with international support groups to resolve the Tibetan problem. Not having met with much success, they reportedly came up with the idea of organising the contest.

During each round of the contest, all the four contestants, Tenzin Deiki, Tenzin Yangkyi, Lhapkat Dolma and Dolma Tsering (Miss Tibet) vociferously raised the Tibetan issue.

The contestants constantly said that Tibet was a free country and was not a part of China, said sources. They also said that going by the interest shown by both the local and foreign media, the contest had been a success.

However, Lobsang Wangyal and Tenzin Namgyal (editors of bimonthly journal Tibetan Bulletin), and chief organisers and important members of ""Free Spirit Festival"", the organisation behind the event denies the contest was a ploy of any western Tibetan lobby to embarrass China.

They said that the objective behind the contest was to give Tibetan women a platform to express themselves since they were citizens of an occupied country and to promote the Tibetan cause, culture and civilisation.

About the contestants speaking only of freeing Tibet, they added the outburst was natural as young Tibetans were pained by the Chinese occupation.

The Tibetan government-in-exile also did not support the contest. To this, Lobsang and Tenzin, said that the event had been organised privately and had nothing to do with the Tibetan government-in-exile.

Samdhong Rinpoche, de facto Prime Minister, said that he disapproves of staging such contests which were only meaningless exercises. He said beauty contests were not part of the values promoted by Buddhism.

To the organisers plea that Tibet must change with the times, Rinpoche said that then they must stay with China which had undertaken the ''modernisation of Tibet''.

Rinpoche said that he does not think that any western lobby was behind the contest. Minister for religion and cultural affairs, Thupten Lungrik in the exiled Tibetan government, went two steps further.

He reportedly threatened to take legal action against the organisation for staging a beauty contest.

12,Organisers incur losses due to uncertainty,"SURAT: Though incurring commercial losses to varying extents, due to the lacklustre response in the wake of imposition of guidelines for security measures and restrictions on use of loudspeakers, many garba organisers felt relieved on the concluding day of Navratri as everything passed off peacefully.

Bipin Chandra Shah of Destiny Group, which organised garba near the City Light area, told TNN that things would have been better if appropriate decisions, pertaining to the use of loudspeakers, would have been taken right from the beginning. He further added that relaxation in the timings later did have a positive impact on the response from the public but, in commercial terms, the damage was already done.

""This Navratri, the spirit of festivity remained adversely affected as confusion about timings and use of loudspeakers kept many garba enthusiasts indoor or confined to celebrations near their localities,"" said organiser, Vipin Patel.

""All major garba venues remained partially empty as enthusiasts, unlike previous years, preferred not to venture out in view of the prevailing uncertainty about garba timings,"" said organisers of D J Group, which held garba at the amusement park at Daumas-Piplod Road.

Manoj Shinde of Rangeela Group told TNN that the attendance at venues only went up after the timing restrictions were lifted but by then it was too late. However, looking at the uncertainty in the initial phase, the Navratri celebration had passed off on a reasonable note, Shinde added.

However, almost all the major garba organisers are likely to incur losses. The reason being, the collection from entry fees and seasons ticket did not pick up whereas fixed costs in terms of electricity, sponsorships, music orchestra and other logistics remained the same, said many organisers.

On the other hand, in view of initial restrictions of timings, many residential localities had their own arrangements for Navratri celebration in nearby open places.

""A blend of ''shehari'' and orchestrated garba was the hallmark of celebrations this time,"" said Shoba Patel, a resident of City Light area in the city.

Many of the applicants, when tried to get in touch with Solanki, learnt that Solanki had downed his shutters. A complaint was lodged with the police and subsequently, Solanki was nabbed by the crime branch sleuths on Sunday, Jhala told TNN.

Investigations revealed that the accused was involved in a similar racket some years ago in Rander, Jhala added. Investigations are on and his links in Mumbai and at other places are being investigated, Jhala told TNN.
