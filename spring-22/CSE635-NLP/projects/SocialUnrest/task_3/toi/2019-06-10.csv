0,Combing leads to riots in Juhapura,"AHMEDABAD: After a peaceful interlude hell broke loose in the minority-dominated Juhapura area of Ahmedabad on Sunday afternoon following clashes between the police and the residents after two persons were picked up in connection with an earlier riot-related case. Curfew was imposed after nearly two hours of violent clashes between the police and the public.

The police opened fire as residents of the area gheraoed the Vejalpur police station and the police outpost demanding the release of the accused. The police, it was learnt, had also attempted combing the place.

Some four policemen including additional commissioner of police (sector I) Satish Sharma, were also injured in the clash.

As word spread, incidents of violence were also reported from the Jivraj park area where a rickshaw driver was reportedly attacked and at Guptanagar where people resorted to stone-throwing. Sharma told TNN that ""the people tried to force themselves into the chowky and the police station demanding the release of the two accused in earlier riot cases"".

There were bomb explosions and other retaliations against the police move which forced the police to open fire.

1,"PUCL nails BJP, RSS men for role in riots","VADODARA: Another damning report nailing key BJP and RSS functionaries as accused in the communal violence that rocked the city and district in the aftermath of the Godhra carnage will be released as a public information document on June 22.

The 180-page report compiled by PUCL and Shanti Abhiyan details the accounts of riot victims and eye-witnesses of the communal violence in city and parts of district, including Kanwat and Panwad.

Besides naming some key BJP functionaries as prime accused in abetting incidents of looting, arson and murder, the report also pinpoints at the dubious role of about 12 police officials most of whom are of the rank of police inspectors and sub-inspectors.

The PUCL activists have themselves given testimonies of being witness to the communal violence in some parts of the report. ""We had been moving around in the city to help riot victims. During our field visits we witnessed many shops being burnt down, houses torched and similar other manifestations of gruesome violence,"" Rohit Prajapati of Shanti Abhiyan said.

He said the report is based on the accounts of about 5,000 riot affected people. ""We took the written accounts of the riot-hit. About 1,700 filled-up forms were collected and analysed before compiling the report on communal violence in Vadodara. The findings are shocking and if not exposed there is a fear that such heinous crimes committed under the name of ''Hindutva'' will be given a moral sanction,"" Prajapati said.

The report records communal violence as had occurred on a particular date, day and time. It also records the post-riots developments in each area. Beside written accounts, the report has also been based on ""video-recorded accounts of victims and footage of the scene of the crime"".

PUCL and Shanti Abhiyan have planned to release the report simultaneously in four major cities of the country. Subsequently, the report will be submitted to the National Human Rights Commission. Later, a legal cell to file lawsuits against the accused will also be set up in order to help the riot victims, many of whom are still frightened to come forward and lodge legal cases, Prajapati said.

2,Women's group flays inadequate riot rehab,"AHMEDABAD: A delegation of Delhi-based women''s group Saheli, after visiting various relief camps in the city, alleged that the state government had done little to provide relief and rehabilitation of riot victims. The group also condemned the functioning of the women''s cell set up by the government to look into the problems of women and children living in camps.

In a joint statement, group functionaries Sadhna Arya, Shweta Vachani and Vani Subramanian said the women''s cell had no concrete plans of how to handle complaints.

Instead of reaching out to women who were passing through great hardships in the relief camps, the cell had chosen to function from the circuit house annexe. The delegation felt the cell had so far not received a single complaint relating to the sexual violence that the women were subjected to.

Most of the women who met members of the delegation in the camps conveyed them that they had no resources to access the women''s cell office at Shahibaug. Besides, people had also lost faith in the state machinery which had failed to protect them in the recent past.

The women''s group said they were shocked at how, even after so long, the governments in the state and at the Centre had failed to initiate even one short or long-term programme to rehabilitate people.

3,Legal redressal eludes riot victims,"AHMEDABAD: After being at the receiving end of one of the most goriest riots, the victims continue to be a harried lot with another pressing problem on their hands - legal redressal. With the monsoon round the corner and nothing except a tattered tent to cover their heads with, the victims housed in the city''s various camps are worried if they''ll ever be fully compensated for the loss they incurred.

Salim Abdul, a resident of what was once Gulbarg Society and now a resident of the Dariakhan Ghummat camp, complained, ""Although some of us have received Rs 90,000 in cash and Rs 60,000 in bonds as death compensation, we''re still waiting to be redressed for the property loss."" He added that some victims have received cheques worth Rs 200 or Rs 500 for a property loss of between Rs 20,000 and Rs 50,000.

A volunteer with the city-based Citizen''s Initiative Group explained that claiming compensation for missing persons posed the biggest legal hurdle. ""This apart, cases of meagre housing compensation and reassessment of property damage are also full of legal hassles.""

Citizen''s Initiative (CI) has set up a cell to help the victims with their legal problems. However, in order to give justice to the cases they have decided to initially take up cases that have substantial evidence and witnesses to back their claims. ""Taking 500 cases and not taking any of them to their logical conclusion doesn''t make sense,"" reasoned Fr. Moses, director of the St. Xavier''s Social Service Society, which is also a of part of CI.

Moreover, it has not been easy for their volunteers accompanying the victims to police stations to help them file FIRs, affidavits or complaints.

Said Maju, a student volunteer with CI, ""A friend of ours was harassed by policemen when he accompanied Waheeda, a victim, to help her file an FIR."" He further recounted that his friend was taken to a room where he was cross-examined like a criminal. Another volunteer Ankit said that he was once asked if he was ""a Hindu or a Muslim"" at a police station where he was helping a victim.

Further, victims are confused with the amount of paperwork being done by the administrative machinery and voluntary organisations alike. ""Many people come here and get the forms filled out, but ultimately fail to provide any concrete legal help to the victims,"" said Mohammad Aslam, an advocate providing voluntary legal help to inmates at the Dariakhan Ghummat camp.

Mohsin Qadri, an organiser of the Shah-e-Alam relief camp, had this to say, ""Apart from no substantial legal help coming from outside we also have the problem of sending some 5,000-odd residents of Naroda-Patia to their homes."" This should be seen in the light of the CM''s statement where he rejected the demand put forth by victims to provide them with alternative sites to rebuild homes.

Then there are legal issues of victims who aren''t living in the camps or are in the countryside and are left to fend for themselves. Only some NGOs have looked into their issues of relief and rehabilitation.

Says Afzal Khan, a volunteer with Jammat-e-Ulema Hind, ""Only 10 to 15 per cent of riot victims are staying in the camps, but there are about 80 per cent of them who stay outside. Supporting them would be the real challenge."" According to Khan, his NGO has been looking into the health, housing, medical, legal and educational problems of the affected, almost immediately after the riots broke out. As part of legal aid, he said, they help victims file affidavits and complaints before the K G Shah Commission.

The issue of compensation has also become a problem for Javed Hussain, not because he will receive too little of it, but because he has a little too much. A 13-year-old at the Shah-e-Alam camp, who had lost his parents along with six other relatives in the riots, he was surprised to discover that he was to receive about Rs 10 lakh as death compensation being the only surviving relative. But he was more surprised to find himself being mobbed by relatives who suddenly wanted to become his guardians!

6,CM to check ministers’ progress every month,"HYDERABAD: The cabinet ministers now will come under the watchful eye of chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu and their performance, based on the self-appraisal report, will be monitored every month by him personally.

The â€œBalanced Score Card Approachâ€�, a unique system designed to gauge the performance of the ministers, aims at striking a balance between competing needs on ministersâ€™ time, long and short term goals of the stateâ€™s development, economic growth, welfare of the people, departmentâ€™s and governmentâ€™s objectives.

A ten-page format was circulated to the ministers. Some ministers resented being monitored every month, according to highly placed sources.

The job is entrusted to P K Mohanty, ex-officio special secretary to the chief minister, a top official told The Times of India. The qualitative and quantitative indicators, as the appraisal reports are called, will have issues like pending files, media management, office attendance, redressing grievances which will be monitored on a monthly basis.

The ministers are required to decide annual agenda for thrust areas. They will have to report the targets met on monthly basis and hold monthly meeting on the focus areas and measures taken to improve the functioning of their respective departments.

Measures taken to reduce costs and the innovative practices taken up also figure in the report. The ministers should report to Naidu about the financial and physical progress of the major projects every month and hold meetings to review the priority programmes like Transco, Food For Work, Neeru-Meeru and family welfare.

Naidu will be apprised of the files pending at the end of each month and the progress of vigilance, anti-corruption and commission of inquiry cases. The ministers should also keep the CM posted of the pace of the filemovement, number of files cleared in the current financial year and maximum time taken.

The ministers, who are required to conduct four normal and surprise inspections in a month, should also send the related reports to Naidu. The self-appraisals also attach high significance to the media management.

The ministers should report about the number of adverse news reports appeared and remedial action taken.

The ministers should also inform Naidu about the press conferences held on departmental and political matters and number of conferences, workshops, seminars held. The ministers are also asked to report on the action taken on the chief ministerâ€™s announcements.

7,New HR system for govt resources,"HYDERABAD: Moving ahead with administrative reforms for providing effective services to the people, the government has ushered in a new integrated Human Resource Management System (HRMS) for managing resources of the government efficiently.

Apart from having extensive features for management of human resource processes, the HRMS offers comprehensive employee self-service, payroll and learning management systems that are well integrated.

The key objectives of the HRMS include development of a single and integrated view of employee information across all the departments, higher utilisation of the existing infrastructure and technology investments, and provision of a timely and reliable management information relating to human resources for effective decision-making.

The system also envisages integration with other related applications like treasury and payroll, provision of single window services to employees as well as a user-friendly environment accessible over browser, and provision of â€˜anytime anywhereâ€™ training to the staff.

In his orders issued recently, chief secretary K Swaminathan said that in order to ensure the successful implementation of the HRMS, the government has also constituted a Project Implementation Committee (PIC) and accorded administrative sanction for the purpose.

Accordingly, the PIC would be headed by the general administration department special chief secretary (administrative reforms) as chairperson, while the information technology department director (technical) would be its member-convenor. The principal secretaries of home, finance, revenue, information technology & communications, social welfare and related departments would be the members of the PIC.

8,"50% voting in Zilla, panchayat polls","CHANDIGARH: Approximately 50 per cent of the around 1.5 crore electorate voted in the zila parishad and panchayat samiti elections in Punjab held on Sunday amid tight security.

The polling concluded at 4 pm in all 17 districts of the state, the counting of votes will take place on Monday and the results are expected by late afternoon.

Barring some incidents of stray violence, the elections passed off peacefully, officials said.

Supporters of former power minister in the Badal government, Sikandar Singh Maluka and his rival Gurpreet Singh Kangar clashed in Malukaâ€™s village.

The police intervened and the polling continued. A turnout of 43 per cent was reported in Bathinda district and 52 per cent in Ferozepur.

9,Govt-PW talks inconclusive,"HYDERABAD: The second round of negotiations between the Andhra Pradesh government and the outlawed Peopleâ€™s War (PW) emissaries remained inconclusive on Sunday. The talks were overshadowed by an increasing number of police encounters in different parts of the state and the issue of lifting of the ban, at least partially, on the Naxalite group.

The discussions, which began in the chambers of commercial taxes minister K Vijayarama Rao, one of the two government representatives, with the two PW emissaries, revolutionary writer Varavara Rao and balladeer Gaddar, were by and large confined to the incidents of encounters in recent days.

The PW representatives entered the secretariat, the venue of the discussions, shouting slogans against the encounters which they called fake.

They demanded that the government order a judicial inquiry into the incidents to ascertain the facts.

The government, however, defended the police action claiming that the talks were initiated to find a permanent solution to the vexed issue but at the same time, it had to maintain law and order.

While the government was adamant that the issue of lifting the ban on the PW could be considered during the main course of discussions between the two parties, the PW representatives insisted that lifting the ban and removing list of names of those who carry rewards on their heads would facilitate a conducive atmosphere for further discussions.

The government made it clear that as long as the armed squads continued to move around in the rural areas terrorising people and no declaration came forth from the PW on leaving the armed struggle, lifting the ban on the outfit would be difficult.

The PW representatives, however, contended that armed struggle was a part of the PW policy and the issue could not be a hindrance for considering lifting of the ban on the outfit.

â€˜â€˜Armed struggle is only a part of the political principles of the Peopleâ€™s War, which is a national party. It could not be shown as a pretext for imposing a ban on the organisation,â€™â€™ Varavara Rao said.

Both the sides, however, expressed their resolve to continue the negotiation process as there was pressure from the people to end the violence and restore peace in the state.

Government emissary Vijayarama Rao said that the government would continue the negotiations as different sections of society wanted an end to the violence and bringing about peace in the state.

10,Govt explains Geelani's arrest,"NEW DELHI: Describing Hurriyat leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani as the â€˜â€˜front-ranking secessionist leader of J and Kâ€™â€™, official sources on Sunday released an unattributable handout chronicling what it said were his â€˜â€˜anti-India activitiesâ€™â€™ as part of their explanation for his arrest.

While many of the allegations pertain to Geelaniâ€™s public activities and utterances, The Times of India was unable independently to confirm official claims of private conversations he is said to have had with terrorist leaders in Pakistan.

Stating that Geelani met the former Pakistani high commissioner to India, Ashraf Jehangir Qazi, â€˜â€˜for his adviceâ€™â€™, the sources also alleged that Qazi used him as a conduit to send funds for the militants.â€™â€™

On April 23, Geelani is quoted as saying that the â€˜â€˜jehad will continueâ€� in the context of his refusal to dilute his stand on participation in the forthcoming J&K elections. On October 29, 2001, he is reported to have directed Syed Salahuddin, the leader of the Pakistan-based Hizbul Mujahideen to step up militant activities in Sopore.

The hand-out, which details his activities since January 2001, also accuses him of a variety of undefined â€˜offencesâ€™ and for being the â€˜â€˜main recommending authority for all visas to Pakistanâ€™â€™.

<div class=""section1""><div class=""Normal"">NEW DELHI: The arrest of Syed Ali Shah Geelani, the hardline Hurriyat leader known in some circles as the ""Amir-e-Jehad"" (Leader of the Jehad), is the governmentâ€™s response to the assassination of Abdul Gani Lone. It is also another step in the direction of conducting ""free and fair"" polls in the Valley later this year. <br />Geelani, a representative of the Jamaat-e-Islami, has been an advocate of the merger of the state with Pakistan and has steadfastly opposed any negotiations with the government. He has been the main conduit of Pakistani political interference as well as the channel for resources to the separatist elements, including the militants. Though he is no longer the Amir of the Jammat-e-Islami Kashmir, he remains its representative in the Hurriyat.<br />In the coming days, the security forces are expected to step up their offensive against the militants in the state. With the Hizbul Mujahideen already decimated, following a split, the focus will be on the Jamiat-ul-Mujhaideen, the Lashkar-e-Taiba, the Jaish-e-Mohammed and the Al Umar Mujahideen. <br />Having got Pakistan to at least commit itself to ending support to cross-border terrorism, the government is now working towards addressing the internal component of the Jammu and Kashmir problem. As a first step, an effort will be made to do something about the poor governance that afflicts the six key insurgency-affected districts. <br />This could involve a reorganisation of the district and police administration. The aim is to ensure a delivery of administrative and developmental services and eliminate charges of police excesses. <br />Whether a start can be made in this direction before the election is the question since it could mean bypassing of the current state government and involves constitutional issues.<br />Government sources say that in their assessment 70 per cent of the jehadi groups in Pakistan are under the control of the Pakistan army and are bound to be affected by Musharrafâ€™s commitment to end jehadi terrorism. However, there is still significant 30 per cent outside its acknowledged control. <br />These include groups responsible for the Pearl murder or the recent Karachi bomb blast as well as elements of al-Qaeda who are now established in Pakistan. <br />There is worry that some of the recent activities in the state could be the result of an Al- Qaeda infusion into Jammu and Kashmir. <br /><span style="""" font-weight:="""" bold;''="""">Related stories:</span> <br /><img src=""/images/ticker.gif"">Â <a href=""/articleshow.cms?art_id=12497820"">Geelani, son-in-law held under Pota</a><br /><img src=""/images/ticker.gif"">Â <a href=""/articleshow.cms?msid=12493736"">Geelani terms his arrest as politically motivated </a><br /><img src=""/images/ticker.gif"">Â <a href=""/articleshow.cms?art_id=12460715"">Ifthikar Geelani''s laptop reveals sensitive info</a><br /><img src=""/images/ticker.gif"">Â <a href=""/articleshow.cms?art_id=12465134"">Arrest of Geelani politically motivated: Hurriyat</a><br /><img src=""/images/ticker.gif"">Â <a href=""/articleshow.cms?art_id=12498206"">Read Edit: The Mori Message</a> </img></img></img></img></img></div> </div>",NEW DELHI

Asked why the MLAs were brought to Bangalore, Deshmukh said the MLAs needed some peace.

""The BJP and the Shiv Sena are indulging in street fights and the MLAs wanted to be away from it all. Besides, they are using money and muscle power to topple the government in a desparate attempt to come back to power and are making exaggerated claims about their numbers,"" he said.

16,Two CPM MLAs to vote for DF govt,"MUMBAI: The beleaguered Vilasrao Deshmukh government in Maharashtra on Monday inched ahead in the number game, with estranged partner CPM announcing that two party MLAs would bail out the Congress-NCP coalition to prevent ""communal forces"" from coming to power.

""The CPM state secretariat directed the party MLAs to vote in favour of the confidence motion on June 13,"" state CPM secretary Prabhakar Sanzgiri said here. Sanzgiri said the decision was taken by the party''s state committee after party leaders held a meeting with Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh on Monday.

""The meeting took place at the Chief Minister''s initiative and was held in a very cordial atmosphere,"" he said, adding among other things, both sides agreed in principle on number of important issues including clearance of payment due to the cotton growers and to take suitable steps for the welfare of the tribal population.

To a question, the CPM leader said the party decision has been conveyed to the PWP leaders, whose five members hold crucial trump cards for the trial of strength on the confidence motion. He also appealed to the other Left and secular parties to take ""similar stand as we Marxists have taken and prevent the communal saffron alliance take advantage of the situation and storm back to power"".

However, he clarified that CPM''s ideological standing vis-a-vis economic and privatisation policies of the Congress-NCP dispensation ""remains unchanged"". ""But the question of policies is not involved in the current political crisis. The main issue for June 13 confidence motion is that whether Deshmukh regime survives or is replaced by Shiv Sena-BJP alliance,"" he said.

""At present, we have decided to bail out the lesser evil (Congress-NCP)"", he said in reply to a question.
