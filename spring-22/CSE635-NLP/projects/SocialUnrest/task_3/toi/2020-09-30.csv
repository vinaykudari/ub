0,Shah's arrest crippled Bollywood-underworld nexus,"MUMBAI: Film financier Bharat Shah''s acquittal under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) may be a setback for the Mumbai police, but officers in the crime branch claim that the Chori chori, chupke chupke case was instrumental in crippling the nexus between the underworld and the film industry.

A crime branch officer said that threats to film artistes, directors and producers from gangsters like Chhota Shakeel and Abu Salem have stopped to a large extent. â€œEarlier, Shakeel would use his frontmen in the film industry to threaten an actor or director to work in a Hindi film for lower fees. But after his frontman and producer Nazim Rizvi was arrested in the case, the other frontmen in Mumbai preferred to remain in low key.

They also stopped communicating with Shakeel as they feared that every overseas call was being monitored by the Mumbai crime branch,â€™â€™ the officer stated.

Another senior officer said the biggest achievement for the crime branch was to have clipped Shakeelâ€™s wings. â€œThe Shakeel gangâ€™s modus operandi was to threaten film personalities, make them work for less and generate money from the overseas film and music distribution rights. A significant part of the money was siphoned off through hawala to Pakistan, where Shakeel is ensconced. We have stopped this flow of money to the neighbouring country,â€™â€™ he stated.

Reacting to the court order on Shahâ€™s acquittal under the MCOCA on Tuesday, a crime branch officer said, â€œWe are taking it in our stride. But Shah has been convicted under the IPC for not informing the police about Rizviâ€™s links with Shakeel.â€™â€™

He stated that the setback of not getting Shahâ€™s conviction under MCOCA would not affect the working of the crime branch. â€œIn fact, our biggest achievement was when some film personalities approached us in mid-2001 and informed us that the extortion threats from Shakeel had stopped. In the past, the police had tried various methods to curb the threats, but in vain. It was only after the Chori, chori.. case that we put an end to the menace.â€™â€™

In his order, Judge A.P. Bhangale doubted the correctness of the only taped conversation between Shah and Shakeel on October 27, 2000. The judge said he was not satisfied with the transcript panchanama prepared by the police. A senior officer admitted that there were some lapses on the part of the police in preparing a proper panchnama.

1,Fear of fresh arrests haunts Bakery case accused again,"VADODARA: The stigma of once being accused in the Best Bakery case is starting to bother the 21 persons, acquitted by a Vadodara court for the murder of 14 persons at the bakery last year.

With the Gujarat High Court issuing fresh bailable warrants against them, they want the entire process to be completed at the earliest. â€œI lost my mother because of the Best Bakery case,â€� claimed Mahendra Jadhav, one of the acquitted in the case. â€œShe died of cardiac arrest on September 5 when she came to know that the case has reached the Supreme Court. I could not even see her once before she died.â€�

According to Jadhav, his brother had informed the Panigate police of the attack on the bakery. He claimed that he was mistakenly picked up by the police in place of another man with the same name staying near the bakery. â€œNobody ever came and enquired about my family when I was in jail for 15 months. Now, everyone wants to know our view on any development in the case,â€� he added.

â€œAt least my family will have some peace of mind if the case ends quickly,â€� said Ravi Chauhan, another accused, who was the only one to get bail. â€œI am tired of answering the same old questions.We neither had any say when the police arrested us from our homes nor we had any before the court. Now the matter has reached the Supreme Court, and we will have to follow whatever decision comes.â€� Bharat Thakkar, brother of another accused Sanjay Thakkar, added, â€œEven foreigners attack us with a flurry of questions these days, and I donâ€™t know what to tell them.

We just want the government to act fast.â€� â€œPeople have even knocked our doors at odd hours and then start asking about the case. Neither we are interested in saying anything nor we are in a position to say anything regarding the matter. Please allow us to live in peace,â€� said a resident of Hanuman Tekri on condition of anonymity. â€œWhenever a statement is made in Delhi, Mumbai or Ahmedabad, the media and persons from various organisations ask the same old questions,â€� said another irritated resident of Hanuman Tekri.

2,"Sleaze racket busted, 10 arrested","KOLKATA: A sleaze racket was busted in the Park Street area on Monday evening with the arrest of 10 people, including eight women. The racket was allegedly run by a 35-year-old widow.

Acting on a tip-off, a team of policemen led by Park Street OC Faiyaz Khan raided a first-floor apartment of a multi-storey building on Royd Street on Monday morning. Seven women were arrested with two clients in the apartment. Among the arrested women are girls in their late teens to some in their mid-thirties.

Both clients are reported to be affluent businessmen. They have been booked under the Prevention of Immoral Traffic Act. The apartment has been sealed.

The racket was masterminded by a widow who also owned the house, Khan said.

She has been arrested. For quite some days, we had been getting reports about a vice den operating out of the apartment. We put our plainclothesmen on surveillance in the area. After we had a fix on the building and the specific apartment, we decided to move in, said Khan.

3,State govt seeks deregistration of Awas Sangh,"LUCKNOW: The state government has sent a letter to the central registrar of cooperative societies seeking deregistration of the Uttar Pradesh Sahkari Awas Sangh Ltd, which was recently in news for gross violation of government rules and misappropriation of funds to the tune of several crores.

The decision to write a letter was taken at a meeting held on September 27. The letter reveals that after the bifurcation of the state, the Uttaranchal government had said that cooperative housing societies in Uttaranchal were no more under the UP government, clearly stating that it was proposed that all the 108 cooperative societies would be under the Rajya Sahkari Sangh of Uttaranchal. Subsequently, the UP government had deregistered the societies and handed over the charge to the registrar, Uttaranchal.

The letter also clarifies that the state government was the chief share-holder of the awas sangh (renamed as Uttar Bharatiya Sahkari Awas Nigam Ltd), which had been formed by the state government and it was wrong to get it registered under the Central Act without prior permission from the state government. The letter also explains that seeking approval from the central registrar for certain bye-laws is not permitted under the present rules.

Meanwhile, a writ petition has been filed by the nigam''s suspended board of directors, claiming that since the awas nigam was registered under the Multi-state Cooperative Societies Act, the state government had no right to interfere in its functioning.

A senior officer, however, says that while the nigam had continued to enjoy the fruits of being elected under the UP Act, it was also reaping the benefits of flexibility under the central Act. If at all the nigam had to be under the Central Act, the board should be re-elected, he adds.

Interestingly, though the suspended managing director and vice-chairman, Bhagwati Prasad and Sudha Singh respectively, are named as petitioners, besides the board of directors, for reasons best known to him, the suspended board''s chairman Mudit Verma, chose not to include his name in the writ petition, says the officer.

4,Opp puts govt on the grill over F1,"HYDERABAD: Although the Formula 1 race track in Hyderabad is little more than a gleam in Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu''s eye, his government drew flak from the opposition in the Assembly on Tuesday for bidding for high-gloss projects with an eye on real estate values.

The chief minister pointed out that the Congress governments of Karnataka and Maharashtra and the CPM government of West Bengal were pitching for the very same plum. He said he saw something suspicious in the Congress''s hue and cry over his interest in Formula One: ""By raising objections to F-1''s entry into AP, the opposition is indirectly helping our opponents,"" he said.

Congress Legislature Party leader Y S Rajasekhara Reddy said the chief minister was hankering after baubles such as the F 1 track, pubs, discotheques, amusement parks to the detriment of the agriculture and industrial sectors.

He went further and alleged that the government was deliberately going after mega projects with the aim of pushing up the real estate values in their vicinity. ""The CM''s kith and kin will purchase properties surrounding the project at cheap rates and reap the benefits,"" he said.

Naidu in his lengthy reply accused the opposition, particularly the Congress party, of blocking development for fear that the Telugu Desam Party would gain electoral advantage from it.

""The opposition''s behaviour will send wrong signals to the F-1 organisers, who are inclined towards Hyderabad,"" he said.

MIM floor leader Asaduddin Owaisi accused the government of handing over hundreds of acres of land to private players without getting suitable returns, while CPM floor leader N Narsimhaiah asked Naidu to concentrate on the rest of 99 per cent people, who may not get any benefits from such entertainment projects.

Chandrababu Naidu said F-1 would bring investment and employment to the state and that Hyderabad will be put on international map.

""Entertainment is a way to pump in investment and generate employment,"" he said. By raising objections to F-1''s entry into AP, the opposition is indirectly helping our opponents.

5,"Built by a prince, home to Bollywood's princess","NEW DELHI: Till Monday evening, Kavita Thakur was watching Karisma Kapoorâ€™s star-studded wedding, wondering which neighbourhood the star would settle in. When she found out that the actress would soon be her next-door neighbour, her face lit up with a smile.

Apart from the usual security arrangements, there is an extra â€˜â€˜watchdogâ€™â€™, Vishal, from the renovation company â€˜â€˜Image Designâ€™â€™ to discourage star-struck souvenir seekers. The grey-stoned 1,600 yard bungalow, currently, being renovated reportedly houses a swimming pool as well.

O P Sharma, a retired government officer and Karismaâ€™s neighbour, feels that the actress will hardly stay at her south Delhi pad. He said: â€˜â€˜Iâ€™m sure she will be paying just the occasional visit as she might be travelling for her career.â€™â€™ Taking a different stand, another neighbour, D N Chopra queried: â€˜â€˜Now that sheâ€™s married, do you think she will carry on with her career?â€™â€™ And pat came his repartee, â€˜â€˜Sunjay Kapoor, if you know, is the grandson of Raunaq Singh (Apollo tyres).

I donâ€™t think she will continue acting, she has married into a conservative family.â€™â€™ K L Rathee, former municipal commissioner, said, â€˜â€˜After all, Karisma is a human being like us. She, too, has to live somewhere.â€™â€™

With other posh options like GK-I, Jor Bagh and Prithviraj Road, why did the actress chose Vasant Vihar? Rathee says there is nothing flattering about the prospect as itâ€™s only a matter of years before Vasant Vihar turns into a â€˜â€˜multi-storeyed slum.â€™â€™ Built 30 years ago, by a prince from Rajasthan, letâ€™s hope the villa brings happy times for the Zubeidaa princess and her childhood sweetheart.

6,Gangster appeals 'illegal' arrest,"NEW DELHI: The alleged gangster, Babloo Srivastava, has challenged his arrest by the special cell by filing an appeal against the arrest in court. Srivastava moved the petition before the Delhi high court, claiming that the arrest was illegal.

The special cell arrested Srivastava last week after a Delhi based businessman alleged that the accused, had blackmailed him while being in a Lucknow jail, and demanded money of him. The high court Bench of justices Usha Mehra and Pradeep Nandrajog has issued a notice to the Delhi Police who are expected to submit a reply on October 22. Srivastava has claimed in his petition that he was extradited to India from Singapore, in 1995, on the condition that he would be tried only in four cases.

Three of the cases against Srivastava are for murder. According to Srivastavaâ€™s petition, he cannot be made an accused in a new case based on the prior extradition order. And if the police wants to charge him as an accused in a new case, he added, they should send him back to Singapore first and start new extradition proceedings against him to bring him back to India and try him for the new offence. The businessman had apparently visited Lucknow in April when Srivastavaâ€™s men stopped him while he was travelling and asked him to meet the accused who was in jail at the time. The complainant, who is the manufacturer of high security number plates, was stopped by four persons in a Maruti 800 inside Lucknow city.

The four allegedly forced the businessman to meet Babloo inside the jail. On reaching the jail, the businessman claimed, Babloo spoke to him on his cell phone. After that Babloo met him and asked the businessman to pay Rs 25 lakh to his men. Babloo also threatened him of dire consequences. The businessman apparently informed the local police of the incident, following which the crime branch-criminal investigation department (CB-CID) tapped his phones.

In his complaint to the special cell, the businessman claimed that Babloo threatened him at the behest of Nitish Sahani, who is his business rival. Sahani is also accused in the same murder case which is pending against Babloo at Karkardooma.

7,Bengal govt will appeal against ban,"KOLKATA: The West Bengal government will appeal to a division bench of the high court against the Monday ruling of judge Amitabha Lala, ordering police to ban processions on weekdays between 8 am and 8 pm in the city.

The stateâ€™s Congress party president, Pranab Mukherjee, said they, too, planned to appeal, as the order violated the fundamental right of expression enshrined in the Constitution. His party was willing to support a state government appeal, too, he said.

State law minister Nisith Adhikary said the appeal plea would be filed by the city police, most probably during the puja vacation. The minister said the order impacts the constitutional rights to freedom of expression and assembly. â€œOne canâ€™t chop off the head to get rid of a headache.â€�

8,"Resignation a political farce, says Congress","NEW DELHI: The Congress on Tuesday said the CBIâ€™s â€˜â€˜deliberate failureâ€™â€™ to file a caveat before the Lucknow Bench of the Allahabad High Court had ensured â€˜â€˜a temporary reliefâ€™â€™ for HRD minister Murli Manohar Joshi.

The resignation episode of Joshi was â€˜â€˜nothing, but an elaborately staged political farceâ€™â€™, party spoke-sman S Jaipal Reddy told reporters. He asked Prime Minister Vajpayee to clarify whether a possible vacation of the stay order on Joshiâ€™s petition on November 4 would automatically lead to his exit from the cabinet.

It was equally important for Vajpayee to clarify whether Advani would be dropped from the Union cabinet if the discharge â€˜â€˜obtainedâ€™â€™ in the Rae Bareli court was stayed by a superior court, he said. Reddy said the party would also want to know when Vajpayee would stop the â€˜â€˜misutilisationâ€™â€™ of the CBI by his â€˜â€˜guilty ministers to escape the legal consequence of their sinister deeds on December 6, 1992â€™â€™.

Joshiâ€™s resignation, he said, reminded the people of various â€˜â€˜stuntsâ€™â€™ such as those of George Fernandes, Nitish Kumar, Mamata Banerjee and Harin Pathak, â€˜â€˜which have become the hallmark of the NDA governmentâ€™â€™. â€˜â€˜The misuse of the CBI by the NDA government and the connivance of the CBI have once again been demonstrated,â€™â€™ he said. Reddy asked if the framing of charges against Union ministers was regarded as a â€˜â€˜disqualificationâ€™â€™ by the NDA government, â€˜â€˜then how Advani, Joshi and Uma Bharati were taken into the cabinet in 1998 itselfâ€™â€™? Reddy recalled that the chargesheet was filed by the CBI against them, way back in 1997, as also a consolidated chargesheet in the Lucknow sessions court the same year.

â€˜â€˜We may further point out that Vajpayee as PM, while replying to the debate in Parliament in 2,000 had declared, â€˜unabashedlyâ€™ that no minister would be dropped even if charges were framed against him/her in the Ayodhya case,â€™â€™ he said. In this background, Reddy said the â€˜â€˜current display of sensitivityâ€™â€™ towards the process of framing of charges was not only â€˜â€˜hypocritical but also ridiculousâ€™â€™.

Earlier in the day, BJP president M Venkaiah Naidu said the High Court order proves that it was a â€œpolitical caseâ€� and it would be fought out â€œpolitically and legallyâ€�. â€œWe are happy about the stay given by the court and I am confident all our people will be discharged,â€� Naidu said.

9,HC pulls up govt on cops' transfer,"PATNA: The Patna High Court once again expressed its annoyance on Tuesday over the lukewarm attitude of the state government towards high court suggestions for improving the law and order situation of the state by transferring police officers from one place to another.

Hearing a PIL filed by Bihar Rajya Vyavsayee Sangh, a division bench comprising acting Chief Justice Nagendra Rai and Justice S K Singh, observed that whatever has been done by the state government in implementing the suggestions made by the high court in its earlier orders has not come through affidavits till date. The reports submitted to the bench so far and submissions made by additional advocate general S K Ghose are just an eyewash, it stated.

The court asked the state government to come with substantive action taken report on the suggestions made by the high court on October 21. The bench further observed that whatever reports it has received so far from the police department shows that it has made merely cosmetic changes by transferring lower rank policemen right from inspectors to constables and that too within the same district, whereas the high court had suggested their transfer from one district to another.

The bench gave vent to its displeasure over non-appearance of DGP D P Ojha in the court on Tuesday despite court order to this effect. DIG (headquarters) Ajit Dutta appeared before the bench in place of DGP and that too in civil dress. The HC adjourned for the day on Tuesday afternoon after condoling the death of senior high court advocate Vyasmuni Singh, who died of brain haemorrhage.

10,Badal warns Amarinder against confronting farmers,"CHANDIGARH: Shiromani Akali Dal president Parkash Singh Badal has cautioned chief minister Amarinder Singh against pursuing the path of confrontation with farmers in the state and said this could have disastrous consequences not only for the government and the ruling party but for the entire state.

Commenting on the farmers'' agitation on Tuesday which caused the death of a farmer, Badal demanded compensation for the loss of crops due to inclement weather, especially in Bathinda and Mukatsar districts where farmers had been up in arms.

Badal, who toured the area, said the extent of damage to crops in many affected areas was widespread and that the loss was caused at a time when the crop had already matured and was ready for harvest. Therefore, no ordinary girdawari could fully assess the extent of damage caused to the farmers. The only reasonable course open to the government was payment of full compensation after evaluating the value of the crops, he argued.

Badal came down heavily on the Bathinda administration for its alleged failure to coordinate with the railways authorities during the farmers'' agitation on Tuesday.

He blamed the state government for allowing such incidents to take place and build an atmosphere of confrontation in the state.

Badal said the chief minister would be unable to face farmers'' wrath after having gone back on all the promises he had made to them, including those pertaining to the continuation of the free power facility, payment of bonus on paddy and no taxes on river water irrigation.

12,MRPL awaits govt approval,"MANGALORE: The request from Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Limited for recognising full template capacity of Rs 9.69 million metric tonnes for the purpose of domestic sale of products under the Industry Logistic Plan, is awaiting government approval, said ONGC-MRPL chairman, Subir Raha, on Tuesday.

He said a stand alone Marketing Terminal with new Rail/Road loading facilities is under implementation at a cost of around Rs 75 crore. ""This evacuation facility, combined with already established coastal pull out and road loading facilities for black oil, naphtha and bitumen, will make the refinery directly capable of servicing all oil companies and direct customers in the deregulated market,"" he observed.

Raha pointed out that as a subsidiary of ONGC, MRPL''s credit-worthiness has substantially improved. MRPL has been assigned A1+ rating by ICRA, indicating highest safety, for its commercial paper/short term borrowing of Rs 300 crore.

""This has resulted into substantial reduction in interest costs on working capital borrowings. MRPL is now considering several options to achieve substantial reduction in interest costs on long term rupee loans,"" he added.

MRPL is proposing to invest around Rs 750 crore to upgrade its manufacturing facilities to produce Motor Spirit and High Speed Diesel, conforming to Bharat III and Bharat IV standards.

Investments of about Rs 75 crore are also being considered for manufacturing of Mixed Xylenes, which will add value to the product mix profile, Raha noted.

With the commissioning Mangalore -- Hassan -- Bangalore Pipeline (MHBPL) Project, the economic supply envelope of MRPL has expanded substantially, he said.

13,BJP dharna puts party restructuring on hold,"PATHANKOT: Even as new district presidents have been appointed in most of the districts, the restructuring of the Gurdaspur BJP unit has been put on hold due to the ongoing dharna at the district headquarters at Hanuman Chowk.

The dharna entered the 23rd day on Wednesday, but the administration has been indifferent to the party''s demand of withdrawing cases against its 24 leaders who participated in union minister Vinod Khanna''s Mukerian-Gurdaspur bridge inauguration ceremony. The Gurdaspur BJP unit is waiting for its newly-appointed state president Avinash Khanna''s arrival within a few days. Khanna is expected to boost the morale of the agitating party members.

While the district adminstration seems to be in an unrelenting mood, the BJP is understood to have decided to sit on an indefinite fast after Avinash Khanna''s visit. There is already a race among BJP leaders to please him for having their names included in the district unit.

According to party insiders, Vinod Khanna will have a greater say in appointments of the new office-bearers. Their track record in consolidating the party base will be the main criteria.

Many heads may roll for non-performance and indulging in intra-party feuds, which led to the party''s debacle in the last assembly elections. It is no surprise that in Upper Doaba, which has a predominantly Hindu vote bank and is a strong BJP bastian, none of the party''s candidates could retain their seats.

Former state BJP president Brij Lal Rinwa had left it to the respective office-bearers to resign on their own if they desired to own moral responsibility for the defeat.

The morale of the BJP rank and file is good after the large turnout of at two successful rallies at Naushehra Pattan recently. There is a feeling among them that the Congress will not be a formidable threat to Khanna in the coming Lok Sabha elections. But the party think-tank is also concerned over the low turnout of BJP cadres at Khanna''s rallies in Pathankot.

Sources said that internal bickering among Pathankot BJP leaders had led to the erosion of the party''s mass base among traders and small businessmen.

This led to Master Mohan Lal''s defeat at the hands of Ashok Sharma, who won the seat by a big margin during the last assembly polls.

In order to consolidate the party base, the leadership may give an important party portfolio to Vijay Mahajan, president, Pathankot Central Mahajan Sabha, who is an undisputed leader of the Mahajan community comprising over 35,000 votes in the city.

Mahajan, who joined as an RSS worker in his school days, has been instrumental in building the BJP''s base in Pathankot. But his claim for the party ticket was denied in 1997 when Master Mohan Lal was given the ticket.

The axe may fall on some of the incumbent BJP office-bearers also, who are considered a liability following a number of complaints to Vinod Khanna that ``instead of promoting the party cause, they have been more busy in promoting their business''.

Sources said that Vinod Khanna was likely to revamp his camp office at Pathankot for better interaction with party leaders and the electorate. His office at Jodha Mal Colony on Dhangu road here has been lying defunct for quite sometime now. Gurdaspur BJP press secretary Pradeep Raina said that change in the Gurdaspur unit was imminent and could take place after the agitation. ``Right now, all our leaders are busy making it a movement for change directed against the oppression of the Amarinder government. We will organise a red-carpet welcome for state party president Avinash Khanna who will be visiting here shortly,'' they said.

14,Vishwanath's statement stirs party members,"MYSORE: Local Congress leaders on Wednesday demanded the expulsion of state co-operation minister, H Vishwanath, from the state cabinet and Congress party, for his alleged anti-party statement.

At a joint press meet, they said the statement of Vishwanath on the functioning of the party, will not only reflect badly on the party, even it will breed animosity among the various caste and communities in the state.

They said Vishwanath, who himself thinks a great leader of backward classes in the process of championing their cause, issues statements insulting upper caste people.

""Can Vishwanath proves that upper caste and community people have not voted for Congress in the elections,"" they ask, alleging Vishwanath of having a habit of criticising the upper caste people.

They said this is not the first time that Vishwanath has come out with such an anti-party statement. Even in the past his statement against Vokkaligas created ripples in the community forcing the community youth to stage protests and dharnas against the minister, they said.

The leaders said it is Vishwanath, who is solely responsible for the party''s declining strength and support base in Mysore district.

Minister who has failed to organise the party in Mysore district and intolerant of D K Shivakumar''s popularity has made him to issue statements against the latter, they alleged urging the party high command to expel him from both the party and government.

Local leaders, who addressed the press included Yedatale Manjunath general secretary district congress committee, N Bhasker secretary KPCC Sc and St cell, R K Bantanaiak and J Loknathgowda.
