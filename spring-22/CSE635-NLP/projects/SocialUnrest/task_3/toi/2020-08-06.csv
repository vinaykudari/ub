1,A rare first for housing and development board,"LUCKNOW: The UP Housing and Development Board created history on Tuesday, when it became the first housing board in India to get the ISO 9001:2000 certificate for its Quality Management System.

Terming it as a historical achievement, housing and urban development minister Lalji Tandon said that the board had carved a niche for itself in the international market, which was a source of inspiration for the entire housing sector.

The journey, from the days when the board did not even have adequate funds to distribute salaries, to this day, when it has created a pension fund of Rs 40 crore, thereby providing security to its employees, is a saga of success, he said. The ambition, imagination and efforts of the employees had brought a sea change in the functioning of the board, he added.

The vision, he said, was to provide houses to all and, the government had particularly taken responsibility for the weaker section. The government''s target in the 10th five-year plan, he said, was 17 lakh houses, of which, 3-4 lakh had already been made.

Giving the example of the Ghaziabad Development Authority, which had risen to the number one position among all the development authorities in the state, and the Kanpur Development Authority, which had also emerged as a debt-free organisation with fixed deposits amounting to Rs 80 crore, Tandon advised to use the money for more development work. ""Sell more â€” earn more,"" he said.

The CEO of Asia Pacific Region Bureau Veritas Quality International (BVQI) India Pvt Ltd, Richard Kaszuba, said that now the board had an additional responsibility. ""You have to audit yourself, while the external auditor, BVQI will also evaluate the quality of your service. After three years, you will say â€” we were successful,"" he added.

Mentioning that there were many more milestones to be achieved, regional head BVQI, MS Gaur, said that the pro-active approach of the housing commissioner, VN Garg, towards quality management system had been the reason for its success. ""In quality, there was no finishing line,"" he added.

Chairman of the board, Atul Kumar Gupta, said that after this milestone, the board was stable on a platform, eager to rise. The chalta hai attitude must be shelved, he said, adding, ""if there is a specification, it needs to be fulfilled.""

Housing commissioner, VN Garg said that with all the 132 offices being certified by the internationally acclaimed BVQI, the challenge was now even bigger, ""that of maintaining this position.""

Housing secretary JS Misra said: ""With the housing board in a leading position, a new chapter had to be opened.""

Additional commissioner housing, Kamran Rizvi, who is also the management''s representative, said that the board had achieved this through guidance from the superiors.

On the occasion, the board also offered cash prizes to the winners of a competition on low cost housing under Vambay. While consultant architect Ajay Bahal bagged the first prize of Rs 50,000, architects Vishal Gulati and Dattatray Govind Parab won the second and third prizes respectively.

2,Need for national policy on water: Chautala,"CHANDIGARH: Haryana Chief Minister Om Prakash Chautala has stressed the need for a national policy on water so as to make ""rational use"" of available water resources in the country.

The chief minister, who was speaking at a public meeting after laying the foundation stone for a mini-secretariat at Narwana on Wednesday, said that there were many states which had been facing shortage of water. A national policy on water would enable deficit states to have an adequate supply of water, he observed.

Earlier, Chautala inaugurated a water channel which has been taken out of Barwala Link Canal to supply water to old water works of Narwana. He also laid the foundation stone for the extension of Narwana minor at village Farenkalan. It would cost Rs 2.28 crore.

3,BJP minister turns down CM's request,"LUCKNOW: After BJP MLA Ram Iqbal Singh, it''s now the turn of a saffron party minister to take on chief minister Mayawati.

The BJP minister has turned down Mayawati''s request to transfer prime land of employment exchange near Charbagh station for the construction of Haj House.

An infuriated Mayawati has taken up the matter with urban development minister Lalji Tandon. But labour minister Dharampal Singh has refused to give in. With an eye on Lok Sabha polls, construction of Haj House was one of the promises made by Mayawati to keep Muslims in good humour. But a suitable land for the Haj House could not be located even after one year of her announcement.

Of late, officials put on the job, woke up from their slumber when the chief minister took them to task. A high-level meeting, attended by the commissioner and district magistrate, Lucknow Development Authority vice-chairman and other senior officials, was held on July 22 to find a suitable land. Finally, the committee zeroed in on a prime big piece of land in Charbagh, housing employment exchange.

A proposal was drafted and sent to the labour department for immediate clearance for handing over the land. But labour minister Dharampal Singh refused to sign the file. Since then the matter is hanging fire between the CM secretariat and the labour department. Finally, BJPLP leader Lalji Tandon was approached to mediate. Tandon is learnt to have held talks with the labour minister but Dharampal Singh has refused to sign the file.

""The land houses the employment exchange and the government wants immediate possession without giving an alternative site to the department,"" points a senior labour officer.

Another officer points out that dreams of thousands of unemployed who frequently visit the employment exchange for registration and information about new job opportunities would be shattered if the exchange was closed down abruptly. ""On the one hand the government promises to create job opportunities and, on the other, it was out to close down the employment exchange,"" rues the officer.

The CM secretariat ,however, denies the move to disband the employment exchange. ""There is no such move. The government would provide an alternative site and it would be housed in a new building,"" said a secretary.

But the labour minister is learnt to be in no mood to surrender before the diktats of the CM. He has lodged a protest with Lalji Tandon and has warned to take up the matter with the party Central leadership if interference from Mayawati in their departments continued. When contacted, Dharampal Singh refused to comment.

""I will speak only after consulting the party leadership and at the party forum,"" he said.

4,CPM's protest day on Aug 7 against SC verdict,"KOLKATA: The CPM on Wednesday said the ruling of the Supreme Court â€” which stated government employees in general did not have ''legal, fundamental and moral or justifiable rights to strike work'' â€” was not acceptable.

Terming the ruling as ''anti-people'' and ''unwanted'', the state secretariat of the party said that it would observe August 7 as a protest day across the state against the ruling of the apex court.

The CITU said no court could deprive workers of the right to strike. To protect their rights, if necessary, the working class ''may go on strike again''.

The CPM state secretariat convened an emergency meeting during the day to review the impact of the ruling.

CPM state secretary Anil Biswas said at a Press Conference that on August 7 people would be made aware of the impact of the ruling.

""We will have to organise awareness programmes against the impending danger of the ruling,"" Biswas said.

The statement also said that the BJP-led government, which followed the economic policies as dictated by the capitalists, was destroying the interest of the common people.

The ruling would encourage these anti-people forces and would be used to give formal shape of despotism which is dangerous for democracy and the country as a whole.

Chief Minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee declined to comment of the issue. He said he would react to this only after discussing the matter with his party colleagues.

CITU General Secretary Chittabrata Majumdar said the ruling was unfortunate and that right to strike ''is fundamental right'' of the working class. ""No court can take out these fundamental rights,"" he said.

State co-ordination committee general secretary Sarajit Roy Chowdhury said, ""going on strike is a birth right of trade unions and under no circumstances are we going to let go of this right.""

5,Work resumes at clash-hit sheds,"KOLKATA: After being held up for a day due to clashes between members of rival trade unions, work resumed at the Central Inland Water Transport Corporation sheds in the port area on Wednesday.

Security was beefed up at the complex, with armed security personnel and metal detectors in place.

""This is not the first time that workers have fought at the sheds. However, there has never been such a major clash. There is rivalry between the two groups but there are some good leaders too. The workers shift loyalty from one union to the other as and when they choose,"" observed Commander P Tayal, chairman, CIWTC.

The 356 casual workers live near the CIWTC sheds.

""When one of them dies or is too old to work, he is replaced by a young man. I have heard a 22-year-old claim that he has been working for 25 years. Security is a problem. Till Tuesday, anybody could walk in and out as they pleased,"" an official said.

Due to the incident, workers were deprived of a major share of work as 70 of the 117 truckloads of wheat, meant to be loaded on to barges for Bangladesh, were shifted to sheds near Rabindra Setu.

There are two handling contractors who quote rates for loading and unloading of the barges. The same batch of casual workers work for both.

""The workers have not received their dues for the last 22 months. The labourers are entitled to Rs 2,700 per month plus incentives on the cargo they handle. The handling contractor promised to make some advance payment.

Some money was paid in March and June. Another instalment is due on August 10.

A small dispute over attendance led to a fight with bombs and guns. This was an attempt to scuttle payments by the contractor,"" alleged supervisors Gautam Bhattacharya and Haider Ali.

The two belong to the CITU-affiliated Contractor Labour Union. ""The contractor patronised the INTUC members,"" Ali said.

The contractor, Kanak Chatterjee, refuted the claims. ""We have not patronised any section of workers. The problem is that work is not sufficient for all the workers,"" he said.

6,Sales tax on certain commodities revised,"BANGALORE: With implementation of Value Added Tax (VAT) put on hold, the Karnataka Assembly on Wednesday passed a Bill revising sales tax rates on certain commodities and levying an additional 1 per cent tax on certain others, to mop up Rs 300 crore more revenue during the current financial year.

Under the Karnataka Sales Tax (Amendment) Bill, 2003, Sales Tax has been revised on certain commodities from 2, 4, 8, 12 and 15 per cent to 4, 5, 9, 13 and 16 per cent which would be close to the tax rate prevalent prior to 2002-2003.

The bill also sought to introduce a non-collectible additional tax of 1 per cent on certain commodities.

The revised rates have come into effect from June 1, 2003.

The revised rates were an interim measure and would be dismantled once the VAT was introduced, it was stated in the bill which was introduced to replace an ordinance.

Opposing the Bill, BJP members led by their leader Jagadish Shettar said trade would shift to neighbouring states and staged a walk-out.

8,Haryana politicians in election mode,"CHANDIGARH: Though there is still a year-and-a-half to go for Assembly elections in Haryana, state politicians are out to sway the masses with their tall promises and populist slogans.

The Haryana Vikas Party (HVP), led by former chief minister Bansi Lal, is in the forefront so far as this side of state''s political scene is concerned.

Bansi Lal, who had swept the polls in 1996 with the help of his controversial prohibition slogan, has been promising at his rallies these days that in the event of his party coming to power in the coming Assembly elections, he will give unemployment allowance to unemployed youth.

A very attractive offer indeed at its face value. But will the state exchequer be able to bear this recurring burden is any body''s guess given the prevailing financial health of the state government.

No doubt, Bansi Lal''s prohibition slogan, too, had at one stage caught the imagination of the people who finally voted his party to power only to find out that all that glitters is not gold.

Prohibition in the state failed miserably forcing its architect to withdraw it not before depriving the state exchequer of hundreds of crores of excise revenue.

It had almost become impossible for the government at that time to undertake developmental works for want of funds. As such, the net outcome of the policy of prohibition, which at one time become the vote catcher, was the emergence of a liquor mafia the sole aim of which was to make quick buck through bootlegging.

Bhajan Lal of the Congress is not lagging behind in this mad race to appease the electorate. He has been promising that in the event of his party coming to power, he would see to it that at least one member of each family in the state got a job.

Of course, he has never explained as to how he would create so many jobs to fulfill his promise. At one time, Congress Legislature Party (ALP) leader Bhupinder Singh Hooda also used to promise that in the event of the Congress coming to power in the state, poor farmers in the state would be given free power.

But lately he has stopped making this offer. Perhaps he has taken cue from the farmers'' wrath against Chief Minister Om Prakash Chautala who, too, at the time of last Lok Sabha elections promised to provide free power and water to the farming community besides promising to write off their power arrears.

Chautala is now facing the music. A section of the farming community has refused to pay their current electricity bills unless their power arrears are waived off.

Chautala denies having made such promises. He pointed out that, in fact, what he had promised was supply of ""quality power"" at reasonable tariff.

Quality power or no quality power, the fact remains that recovery of power arrears from farmers is Chautala government''s biggest headache today.

9,Govt to protect ailing W Bengal Tea Development Corp,"KOLKATA: The standing committee of the West Bengal assembly on commerce and industries has asked the state government to take initiatives to protect the ailing West Bengal Tea Development Corporation.

The committee feels that the state should take up programmes for new tea plantation in the gardens, besides maintaining the old ones.

Meanwhile, a report of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India revealed that the failure of brokers to realise the average sales price and the absence of monitoring on the part of the company over auction resulted in loss of potential revenue of Rs 6.07 crore to the company during 1999-2001.

Despite this loss, the company did not explore the options of private sales, the report alleged.

The report further stated that deployment of 558 labourers in excess of district average in Rungmook Cedars tea estates resulted in an extra expenditure of Rs 5.40 crore on account of salaries and wages.

""If the production of the tea-gardens is not increased satisfactorily, the corporation will not survive and the accumulated loss of the WBTDC will go on increasing. The state should adequately finance the corporation so that tea production is increased,"" said committee chairman Sunil Kumar Ghosh.

Ghosh hoped that the state government would increase the allocation to the WBTDC under the plan budget for 2003-04.

The corporation was incorporated in 1976 as a wholly owned government company with the main object of purchase /takeover of economically viable tea estates. The other objective was the development of the tea estates for carrying on the business in plantation, manufacture and sale of tea.

Altogether the WBTDC has six tea estates, three in the hills and three in Jalpaiguri district. According to the committee, out of these six tea estates only Sonali tea estate is running with some profits.

Ghosh said that these six tea estates have become too old and for this reason tea production has fallen. ""Now these gardens need more and more new plantations to increase the production,"" he added.

10,"Shourie rules out zero rental for BSNL, MTNL phones","NEW DELHI: There is no proposal before state-owned telecom operators - Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd and Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd - to waive monthly rental in telecommunications services, communications minister Arun Shourie informed the Rajya Sabha on Thursday.

BSNL and MTNL were already offering competitive tariffs and special packages were also being offered to attract customers, he said during the question hour.

He also said there was no proposal before BSNL to provide free handsets to customers, he said replying to another question.

To another question, the minister said Nasscom is exploring the feasibility of cooperation between Indian and Chinese companies for IT requirements of the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing.

He also said MTNL has made a total capital investment of Rs 120.01 crore during the last three years, of which Rs 100 crore was invested in ITI Ltd and the rest in United Telecom Ltd in Nepal.

He said so far no dividend had been received by MTNL from the above capital investment.

12,"Stop gender bias, Najma tells govt","NEW DELHI: Gender bias hit the Rajya Sabha on Thursday with deputy chairperson Najma Heptulla effectively pulling up the government for not incorporating gender-neutral, non-discriminatory language in legislation.

""I want proper language... I will write to the law ministry on this,"" she said, intervening in the debate on the Central Vigilance Commission Bill to probe corruption allegations against officials.

""Why just put down ''he'' in all legislation, how can you assume no woman will ever become chairperson?"" she asked, refusing to accept any explanations.

On a lighter note she said, ""No, I don''t believe (the word) man includes woman; if you go by the spelling, (the word) woman would include man."" But ""I don''t want any discrimination against men either.""

Beginning the debate amid pleas from chairman Bhairon Singh Shekhawat and Heptulla to complete work on pending Bills on Thursday, MPs essentially posed a series of queries on the framing of this law, its efficacy and special privileges to bureaucrats of the rank of joint secretary and above as a run-up to prosecution, despite a Supreme Court judgement.

""Will you permit this institution to work independently?"" asked one MP.

""The CVC will have no powers at all"", said another as Saifuddin Soz of the Congress worried about the ""sluggishness"" of the executive versus the judiciary, voiced alarm at the ""enormous proportions"" of corruption and noted that the CVC would be so handicapped by restrictions it would not be able to perform.

""How could the deputy prime minister, with a case against him, be on a selection board?"" he wondered. ""And why was the CBI not specifically brought into the net?""

Those who would be affected and would need to save themselves were the ones who had prepared the Bill, said Samajwadi Party''s Ram Gopal Yadav, ready to furnish a list of IAS officials who had signed over rights to expensive property under pressure from the Uttar Pradesh chief minister.

""You don''t have the courage to hold an inquiry,"" he told the government.

13,Govt employees protest SC order on strikes,"KOLKATA: The Supreme Court ruling on strikes on Thursday rocked West Bengal with both left and right wing government employees demonstrating against the apex court ruling on strike by government employees.

Employees belonging to the Co-ordination Committee of West Bengal Government Employees and West Bengal Government Employees Union (Naba Parjay), demonstrated in Writers'' Buildings, the state secretariat, during lunch break against the apex court verdict.

Addressing a meeting, general secretary of the Co-ordination Committee, Samarjit Roy Chowdhury, described the ruling as ''unfortunate'' and said workers had secured the right to strike after prolonged struggle.

Stating that workers resorted to strike only if dialogue failed, he said ""they will retain this right through struggle.""

Kolkata district committee secretary of the West Bengal Government Employees Union (Naba Parjay) T Pal said that the verdict was ''unprecedented'' and would be against the interests of state and Central government employees.

He said that the Left Front government had also imposed many restrictions on employees'' movements.

14,Gujarat govt backtracks on power sector reforms,"GANDHINAGAR: A few weeks ago, the Gujarat government took a small step towards power sector reforms. It reduced the subsidy given to the farmers against the highly cheap electricity given to them by increasing the farm tariffs.

After remaining indecisive for two-and-a-half years, the tariffs that stood at just Rs 350 to Rs 500 per horse power (HP) per year (or 20 paisa per unit) for above a decade were increased to between Rs 1,050 to Rs 1,200 (about 45 paisa per unit).

Within a month now, things have begun to look different. A government that declared it would ""not budge"" has suddenly found that it is vulnerable to the powerful farmers'' lobby. Negotiations are on with its representatives for arriving at a ""reasonable compromise"".

The farm power tariff might be brought down by at least 20 per cent, undermining the logic of the market or the plans to make the Gujarat Electricity Board (GEB) commercially viable. A government that officially declared ""reduction in cross subsidisation is a step towards reforms"" is now backtracking.

A reduction in the farm tariff would mean that other sectors of consumers - especially the domestic and industrial users - would pay higher for the extremely cheap electricity the farmers use.

""In value terms, it would mean an additional Rs 150-crore burden on the non-farm consumers"", a senior bureaucrat said.

Minister of state for energy Saurabh Patel justifies this by saying that ""it is duty of the government to see that every category and class of people is uplifted. Even if the state has to pay a higher subsidy to a particular category, nothing is wrong.""

Nor does he think that Gujarat providing a higher subsidy to the farm sector than any neighbouring state - Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh - suggests reforms are slow here.

""Reduction in cross subsidisation is only a part of the power sector reforms"", the minister thinks. ""Increasing GEB efficiency by reducing line losses, renegotiating commercially unviable power purchase agreements (PPAs) arrived at during the Congress regime with independent power plants (IPPs) so as to get cheaper electricity, and stopping the prevalent power theft are all part of the reforms.""

The GEB''s losses in 2002-03 were Rs 2,722 crore. These are over and above the Rs 1,368 crore subsidy it gets from the coffers for providing cheaper power to the farm sector. None knows how the total annual burden of Rs 4,000 crore would be brought down unless the GEB is reformed in line with new Central Electricity Act, requiring market to play the main role in generating, transmitting and distributing power.

Even according to Saurabh Patel''s admission, if the PPAs are renegotiated, the GEB loss on account of the fixed payments made to the IPPs for the purchase of power may go down marginally. ""We may save about Rs 30 crore per month"", he says.

It adds up to just Rs 360 crore in a year. As for reducing line losses and detecting power theft, these are administrative ways that can just supplement steps towards market reforms and fair competition.

Meanwhile, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) is closely watching the state''s failure to go in for GEB reforms by commercialising its operations. Its 350 million dollar loan to the state crucially hinges on the energy sector reforms.

With few plans to reduce subsidies, and losses unlikely to come down, bureaucrats wonder whether the ADB will release the second tranche of 50 million dollars, pending for one-and-a-half years.

15,Modi govt appeals to Gujarat HC,"AHMEDABAD: A day before the BJP''s scheduled demonstration against the NHRC, the state government filed an appeal in the Gujarat High Court in the Best Bakery case where 21 Hindu accused were acquitted by a Vadodara fast track court.

The appeal has attacked the basis of the case by questioning the trial court which had overlooked the fact that the police had ignored the statement of the main witness Zahira Shaikh and instead treated that of Raiz Khan as the FIR.

The Best Bakery appeal listed out 17 grounds for the plea, wherein it noted that the trial court had acted illegally and with material irregularities in casually disposing off the case involving very serious and sensitive issues.

It stated that the court had materially erred in law in admitting as evidence the statement of Raiz Khan recorded by the investigating officer and treating the same as the FIR in the case when the same was not duly proved by examining Khan.

The trial court''s was termed as materially irregular in not treating the statement of Zahirabibi as the FIR which was recorded prior to the statement of Raiz Khan. Further it said that the court materially erred in ""ignoring the subtle legal position â€” merely because the witness turned hostile their evidence cannot be discarded in toto,"" the appeal observed.

Further the medical reports of the witnesses who were injured or killed were also not discussed thoroughly by the court, it added. This is the sixth riot case to go into appeal by the state government.

The government filed one more appeal against an acquittal order delivered by a Godhra Sessions Court where an accused, Salim Shaikh, was acquitted in a case involving an attack on a Harijan vaas in Lunawada on March 1.

The case was booked against Shaikh and a mob of 500 persons.

16,PAC jawans block highway in protest,"LUCKNOW: Traffic on the busy UP-New Delhi Highway came to a grinding halt as hundreds of PAC jawans in civvies along with their wife and children held a blockade for more than four hours on Thursday morning.

The irate jawans and their families were protesting against the strict attitude of the senior officials which they alleged had led to one of their colleagues committing suicide on Wednesday morning.

Reports reaching the Director General of Police Headquarters here (DGPHq) said that Head Constable Deo Ram of 41 battalion PAC at Ghaziabad had consumed poison on Wednesday morning and died thereafter. After all legal formalities, the body was handed over to the family members of the deceased who then took it to their native district of Almora where the last rites were performed on Wednesday night itself.

Though no suicide note was recovered from the site of the incident, Commandant 41 battalion PAC Deepam Seth said that HC Deo Ram was posted at the cash section of the battalion along with the quarter master as his boss.

HC Deo Ram was served transfer orders but was trying to get it stalled as he was reluctant to shift from Ghaziabad. In the meantime, while the accounts of the battalion were being tallied, it was discovered that balance was short by Rs 5.90 lakh.

This was the amount that HC Deo Ram had received at the cash office against his signatures. After HC Deo Ram failed to give the account for the missing cash, an inquiry was ordered into the lapse being conducted by the deputy commandant of the battalion.

The deputy commandant had called HC Deo Ram to his office at 10 am on Wednesday to record his statements on the missing cash to complete the probe which had by then established that the difference in the amount was not because of any official lapse or confusion.

Before appearing for his statement recording, Deo Ram consumed poison and ended his life leaving behind a wife and three children who were staying with him at the battalion quarters itself, the commandant stated. After all due formalities, the body of Deo Ram was taken away by his kin to Almora.

On Thursday morning around 9 am, hundreds of 41 battalion jawans along with their wife and children blocked the highway. They were protesting against the alleged strict approach of the commandant in maintaining discipline through the rank and file of the force. They alleged that the HC ended his life owing to the alleged excesses of this officer itself.

The commandant had recently passed strictures that no jawan would be allowed to keep cattles at his quarters. This apart he had also adhered to the rules and regulations by the book and hence had invited the ire of many a jawans and their family.

The protest was dissolved after the commandant approved two of the demands of the jawans including that the family of the slain HC would be allowed to stay at the battalion quarters and that the Rs 5.9 lakh missing amount would not deducted from the dues of the deceased jawan.

Deputy Inspector General (DIG) PAC has been sent to Ghaziabad to probe into the matter and submit a report to the state government regarding the sequence of events which result in the protest.

17,"SGPC, govt lock horns on medical admissions","CHANDIGARH: Confrontation has been building up between the Punjab government and the SGPC over admissions and fee structure in the two medical and dental colleges being run by the SGPC in Amritsar.

The authorities in the Guru Ram Das Institute of Medical Sciences and Research and the Guru Ram Das Dental college, both in Amritsar, have spurned the government direction on implementing the new fee structure notified last month claiming that it would cause an annual loss of Rs 3.65 crores.

The two institutions have also turned down the government directive on doing away with the quota of NRI seats.

Irked by the defiance of the two institutions, the government has threatened to derecognise them and has asked the registrar of the Baba Farid Medical university to examine the matter and submit a report within the next few days.

The confrontation is also expected to intensify after the state government withdraws the minority status granted to the SGPC-run educational institutions.

The two institutions, in turn, are expected to move the Punjab and Haryana high court seeking redressal for themselves.

The conflict has arisen after the government notification on July 25 which stated that the medical colleges would charge Rs 1.50 lakh annual fee from each student and there would be no provision for paid seats.

The Guru Ram Das college authorities, however, maintained that the notification, issued on the direction of the Supreme Court, came when the admission process had been already put on stream and counselling for admissions was scheduled to take place two days later.

The admissions for the current academic session were undertaken on the basis of the government notification issued earlier in May.

Besides getting peeved at the slashing of fees from Rs 3.20 lakh to Rs 1.5 lakh each student, the management of the college has also taken exception to the abolition of quota of eight NRI seats in the medical college and that of nine seats in the dental college. Each NRI seat would otherwise fetch the management Rs 35 lakh each.

The government has also constituted a committee to look into the violation of official directives committed by the Guru Ram Das Medical college in the last few years.

In a letter to Chief Minister Amarinder Singh, principals of the two colleges have demanded that the state government withdraw the notification.

18,SP demands NHRC probe in Para incident,"LUCKNOW: The Samajwadi Party on Thursday demanded a probe by the human rights commission in the Para incident and a withdrawal of all cases registered against Father Augustine and others.

Addressing a joint press conference state President Ram Sharan Das and leader of the Opposition in the Vidhan Parishad Ahmad Hasan expressed strong reservations on the statements made by the BJP Legislature Party leader Lalji Tandon and the attempts being made by the saffron party to politicise the whole issue.

Hasan, who along with MLC Dr Waqar Ahmad and the general secretary of the city unit Vijay Singh made an on the spot study of the situation on Wednesday said the police action on the demonstrating children, their parents and people of the locality could not be justified. He added Para, a small village located near a railway crossing was practically inaccessible on account of the deplorable conditions of the roads there.

Students of the St Mary School located here had to undergo immense hardship to reach there. The condition of the road had led to many accidents with the students also fracturing their limbs. It was to protest against the government''s apathy that the students led by the principal Father Augustine and other staff members had staged a dharna on the railway track. This had led to the police lathicharging them in which many students were injured.

The SP leaders said instead on ensuring that the road there be constructed Tandon had threatened the closure of the school. He added the school which had been running since 1994 had 900 students presently studying in it and stressed it was no government property that the BJP leader could issue such statements.

Hasan also took exception to the observation made by the chairman of the State Minorities Commission and said it had lowered the dignity of the institution.

In addition to demanding a probe by the National Human Rights Commission the SP leaders have also demanded an immediate withdrawal of all cases registered against Father Augustine and others, an end to the terror tactics being adopted by the administration, strict action against those who lathicharged the students and teachers as also registration of cases against them, compensation to the injured and construction of the road.

19,Woman commits suicide in hospital,"KOLKATA: A woman admitted to a hospital in Kolkata for attempting suicide on Wednesday finally had her way.

On Thursday morning, Sandhya Naskar, 25, hung herself in the bathroom of the Shambhu Nath Pandit Hospital, said DC (headquarters) Kuldiep Singh. She was admitted to the hospital after swallowing acid.

Sandhya and her husband Ajit, both daily-wage labourers, were married for 12 years. Residents of Alampur in Metiabruz police station area, they went to Sandhya''s father''s house at Ramdas Hati in the next village. There, she had a fight with her husband, said her brother Mohan Naskar.

In the ensuing brawl, Sandhya hit her husband with fists. In a fit of rage, she ran out of the room. Soon after, on hearing her groans, Sandhya''s sister-in-law rushed to see an almost empty bottle of muriatic acid lying near her.

Immediately, Sandhya was rushed to the S N Pandit Hospital around 9.45 pm on Wednesday. Around 9 am on Thursday, the sister on duty took her to the bathroom in the female ward of the hospital. It was the peak hour and there was a flurry of activity in the ward, said hospital Superintendent Sukumar Das.

When Sandhya did not come out for a long time, the sister-in-charge waiting outside for her became suspicious. She knocked on the door but there was no reply. She then called a Group D assistant and broke open the door to find Sandhya hanging inside the bathroom, said Das.

Sandhya had used her sari to hang herself from the exhaust fan of the bathroom.

According to Madan, ""we have no complaints against Sandhya''s husband. Rather, our sister was short-tempered and impulsive."" Sandhya is survived by a 10-year-old daughter and a one-and-a-half year old son.

20,Four arrested in ragging case,"KOLKATA: Four senior students of Jalpaiguri Government College, who have been identified as prime culprits in the Jalpaiguri Government Engineering College ragging case that has rocked the state, have been summarily suspended and arrested.

This was said at a hurriedly called press conference by state Higher Education Minister Satyasadhan Chakraborty in Kolkata on Thursday.

First year student of Electronics and Telecommunications Sayandeep Bandopadhyay was severely beaten by second and fourth year boys of the college on Tuesday night, when he tried to escape from the room where freshers were being ragged.

His throat and whole body were slashed with knives, his fingers stamped on and his face punched at. Sayandeep was admitted to the Jalpaiguri Hospital but later released.

""Criminal procedure will start against them soon. In 2000, an anti-ragging law was enforced in the state and anyone who rags a fellow student or helps in ragging, will be punished. There are 17 others who were involved in the crime,"" Chakraborty said.

Director of Technical Education, Amalendu Bose was sent to the college to start investigations against these 17. ""He also has to find out if the college authorities had taken proper action to prevent ragging,"" Chakraborty said.

On Wednesday morning Chakraborty asked the district magistrate of Jalpaiguri to send him a report. ""He wrote back to say that the SDO Jalpaiguri Sadar and the DSP (headquarters) had investigated the case and have already arrested the culprits,"" Chakraborty said.

Of those arrested, one was a former general secretary of the students'' union. ""If the charges are proved against these boys they will be rusticated,"" Chakraborty said.

Expressing his shock at the incident Chakraborty said that despite having an anti-ragging committee, ""such a shameful incident happened inside the college campus.""

Speaking to TNN, state Higher Education Secretary, Jahar Sarkar said, ""there is no use for the committees to meet in the mornings. We have asked the committees of every traditional engineering and medical colleges of the state to keep a stricter vigil during the night.""

""Since 2000 very few such cases in the state. Earlier, one such case in IIT Kharagpur and another at BE College Shibpur, had similarly rocked the state. But still I would say that the incidents of ragging here are fewer compared to other states,"" Chakraborty said, adding that this was the only state where a law existed.

Sayandeep has left the college with his father and is headed home. According to the minister, Sayandeep''s father has left a note with the college principal saying that he was taking his son home.

""The note does not say if Sayandeep will not return to the college. I will assure him that he can safely go back to studies. He is a bright student who had to work extremely hard to secure an engineering seat. I will not let him waste his career,"" Chakraborty said.

22,"Buta did not follow rule, says PAC member","NEW DELHI: The BJP fielded its MP Kirit Somaiyya and a member of the Public Accounts Committee to attack its chairman Buta Singh for alleged ""impropriety"" in finalising the report on Kargil purchases before the minutes were circulated to members and their consent taken.

Somaiyya has written to Lok Sabha Speaker Manohar Joshi, describing the procedure followed by Singh as ""ultra vires"" and ""illegal"" and demanded a detailed enquiry on it: ""The procedure clearly demands that minutes are to be confirmed by the members. Without getting confirmation, which is, waiting for two days, how was the report signed and tabled?"" he asked, adding that the Lok Sabha''s Rule Book and the Procedure of the Committee mandates at least two working days to a member to raise their clarifications and objections to the Committee after the circulation of the minutes.

Somaiyya wanted to know how the minutes of the Committee meeting were circulated on August 5 while the notice to the Lok Sabha Secretariat for tabling the report was given a day before on August 4.

He said he was shocked that the report was made available to the media before it was tabled in Parliament on August 6. He also asked the Speaker whether it could be considered a matter of privilege against the media and the person who made the report available.

23,Trade unions protest against SC order on strikes,"KOLKATA: Government employees and trade union activists took to the streets in Kolkata and organised protest rallies at their offices and at strategic locations on Thursday to decry the Supreme Court verdict, terming strikes by government employees, ""unethical"" and ""illegal"".

The West Bengal Pradesh Congress Committee, meanwhile, urged the state government during the day to make an appeal against the apex court''s order, saying that the verdict would seriously hamper the interests of the workers and employees all over the country.

Government employees belonging to both the Left Front and Trinamul Congress camps, held a demonstration against the apex court ruling during the day with the biggest demonstration held at the state secretariat at Writers'' Buildings in the afternoon.

Employees belonging to the CPM-led Co-ordination Committee of West Bengal Government Employees and West Bengal Government Employees Union (Naba Parjay), held a demonstration at the Writers'' Buildings, during the lunch break against the verdict which said government employees had no moral or legal right to go on strike.

Addressing the meeting, general secretary of the co-ordination committee Smarajit Roy Chowdhury described the ruling as ""unfortunate"" and said workers had secured the right to strike after prolonged struggle. Stating that workers resorted to strike only if dialogue failed, he said: ""they will retain this right through struggle.""

Kolkata district committee secretary of the Government Employees Union (Naba Parjay) Tapan Pal said the verdict was ""unprecedented"" and would be against the interests of state and central government employees. He said the Left Front government, too, had imposed many restrictions on employees'' movements in the recent past.

The CITU, the trade union wing of the CPM, brought out rallies at several places in the city and in the districts to protest against the Supreme Court''s order.

""The CPM is resorting to agitation against the order. But political parties will not be able to solve the problem. The state government should move the Supreme Court and seek a fresh verdict,"" state Congress Vice-President Pradip Bhattacharya said.

Pointing out that a large number of cases were pending before the industrial tribunals, the state Congress leader asked, ""if a worker resorts to strike after waiting in vain for years on end for a verdict from the tribunal, will it be wrong?""

24,State to complete selection of sub-inspectors,"BANGALORE: A division bench of the Karnataka High Court comprising Justices R.V. Raveendran and S. Abdul Naseer on Thursday allowed in part a petition filed by the state government and others challenging the orders of the Karnataka Administrative Tribunal (KAT) in regard to recruitment and selection of candidates for the posts of police sub-inspectors.

The KAT had allowed applications from candidates questioning the recruitment rules and sought for striking down the outer age limit of 27 years for selection to the post. The KAT had allowed the applications and directed the government on April 21, 2003 that the impugned notification for selection of candidates should not be proceeded with unless amendment of age limit for ex-servicemen was made.

25,Lok Ayukta not to investigate govt servants case: HC,"BANGALORE: A division bench of the Karnataka High Court on Thursday ruled that the Lok Ayukta or Upa Lok Ayukta do not have the powers to investigate a case against a public servant after the police have filed a chargesheet under the Prevention of Corruption Act.

Justices Kumar Rajarathnam and K. Bhaktavatsala while dealing with an appeal made by the state which challenged the order of a single judge stating that the Lok Ayukta police could not investigate a public servant, observed that once an FIR was registered under the PC Act, the police wing of the Lok Ayukta shall act independently. The Lok Ayukta or Upa Lok Ayukta shall not interfere in the investigations, and the police shall conduct investigations independently, the bench noted.

Basavaraj Guddappa Maligeri, former Chief Engineer (Communication and Building), PWD, Dharwad had filed a petition against the actions of the Police Inspector of Lok Ayukta who was conducting an inquiry into allegations of him amassing wealth disproportionate to his income.

A single judge who had earlier heard his petition observed that he cannot be investigated by the inspector. The state then came up in appeal before the division bench.

The Bench also stated that the investigation by the Police Wing of the Lok Ayukta is in conformity with the verdict of the Apex Court which observed in the State V/s Kempaiah case that the police wing can investigate a case against a public servant if an FIR is filed under the PA Act.

State Public Prosecutor H.S. Chandramouli appeared on behalf of the appellants.

26,Excise law eased to help illicit liquor traders,"BANGALORE: The Legislative Assembly on Thursday passed the Karnataka Excise (amendment) Bill 2003, which permits payment of penalties instead of cancellation of licences for those indulging in illicit liquor trade.

Amidst stiff opposition and a walk-out by the BJP and AIPJD members, excise minister M.M. Nanaiah piloted the bill and said: ""This will ensure that the revenues from the sector increase.""

The Bill also permits traders to recover their vehicles -- seized while transporting illicit liquor -- on payment of a bank guarantee equal to its value. ""This will only encourage excise contractor and liquor smugglers in their trade,"" S. Suresh Kumar and Araga Jnanendra (both BJP) maintained.

But Nanaiah said: ""It is the servants of liquor license holders who violate rules. It would be unfair to cancel licenses.""

Jayaprakash Hegde (Ind) said vehicles were being released based on arbitrary valuations by individual officers even before this amendment was brought in. ""During the Kundapur council elections, a councillor''s vehicle was seized transporting illicit liquor, but was released with a bank guarantee of just Rs 1.5 lakh,"" he pointed out.

27,Vasudev to raise funds if govt covers the drain,"BANGALORE: Artist S.G. Vasudev has assured the civic authorities that he would rope in artists and corporates to help raise funds if the government takes a decision to cover the storm water drain situated behind his house and develop a park on it.

Vasudev, who wrote to Chief Minister S.M. Krishna on Tuesday pointing out several problems faced by the residents of ST Bed in Koramangala, got quick response from the civic authorities. Krishna mailed him back saying, ""he has gone through the letter in detail and has instructed BCC commissioner to act immediately. Krishna has also assured that if the work carried out is not satisfactory, Vasudev can always come back to him.

""All these years, I was working with the resident associations and tried to prevail upon the authorities to get things right. But it has not helped. The officials even have snapped back asking me why I bought a land here? This is not an answer to a problem. If the pressure comes from the highest authority, things will get moving,"" Vasudev told The Times of India.

Vasudev was inspired after Wipro chief Azim Premji''s outburst about lack of development in Sarjapur road area and the subsequent action mooted by the CM. ""When Azim Premji can do it, why cant I? He complained about the bad infrastructure which is not a welcome sign for visitors to his office. Similarly, people come to my house to see my paintings and the bad roads and stinking drainage puts them off,"" Vasudev retorted.

On Thursday, BCC commissioner M.R. Sreenivasa Murthy called Vasudev to discuss the problems with him. The commissioner, who sent an official release to the media in this regard has stated that the ST bed area is complicated in nature and work would be taken up and completed in one year''s time. Meanwhile, as a temporary measure, the drain has been desilted and slightly widened during last year and the current year.

Dwelling on roads, Sreenivasa Murthy has clarified that because of the poor drainage in the ST Bed, the maintenance of roads has become problematic as repeated flooding and high water table have made the road surface unstable. The roads will be strengthened and work will be taken up at a cost of Rs 25 lakh during October.

""The commissioner has assured me that except the drain work, all other civic problems will be solved immediately and that within a month or two, some difference can be seen,"" Vasudev said.

Vasudev has suggested that if the government decides to cover the drain running behind his house, he would get the artists'' help in developing a landscaped garden on it. ""I will get a good concession on paintings, sculptures and murals which can be fitted in the park. Though the commissioner has said the idea is feasible, the final decision is left to the government,"" Vasudev added.

A missive to the CM and some action. What next? Vasudev does not want to stop at this. ""I will continue the campaign until the problems are fixed. But I will not involve the artists fraternity.""

28,Inter-ministerial panel to meet on Star issue,"NEW DELHI: Another two-week extension to Star for temporary uplinking of its news channel is on the cards. However, the government is still grappling with the intricacies of an issue on which it is duty-bound to lay down the future policy on uplinking from Indian soil.

The inter-ministerial group (IMG) of top officials is expected to meet on Saturday to finalise its recommendations on Star''s application. The government is also under pressure from prominent media personalities and organisations to ensure that it allows a level playing field.

There is demand that the rules and procedures are adhered to by all in letter and spirit. However, this is not an easy task, sources in the information and broadcasting ministry say. The group of ministers (GOM), to which the issue will be referred to, may look at the matter in a wider context.

Likely to materialise on Saturday, this would be the fifth extension for Star. Though the two-week deadline of the previous extension expired Thursday night, the channel continues in its earlier format in view of a court stay restraining VSNL from switching off its signals.

With Star being the only such case which has come up so far, the IMG is focusing on its application to see if the uplinking guidelines need further tightening, sources said.

29,Kanu Sanyal forms new party,"KOLKATA: Communist Organization of India (Marxist - Leninist) leader Kanu Sanyal, a founder of the Naxalite movement, has decided to form a new Communist party, merging some of the Naxalite groups throughout the country.

As a first step, the COI (M-L) and the CPI (M-L) Unity Initiative had merged into an organization called the CPI (M-L) and thereafter the CPI (M-L) and the CPI (M-L) Red Flag had formed an All India Co-ordination Committee, he said.

Sanyal was hopeful that he would bring under the fold of the co-ordination committee the majority of about two dozen Marxist Leninist groups which followed the ""mass line"".

He was critical of some other Naxalite groups like the Peoples War and the Maoist Communist Centre, branding them as ""sectarian"".

""Terrorist activities and annihilation practised by the original CPI (M-L) has been proved to be wrong,"" he said.

""The CPI(M-L) that we will form will be entirely a new party, though the name will be the same,"" he said.

It would follow the path of ""mass struggles"" and even take part in ""legal means"" like elections, but would also take recourse to extra-parliamentary measures when necessary.

Denying that the PW and the MCC had managed to spread influence in large areas of Bihar, Orissa and Andhra Pradesh, Sanyal said these groups did not enjoy the support of the people and had not undertaken programmes like land reforms and land redistribution.

Distancing his organization from mainline Left parties like the CPM and the CPI, Sanyal said these now represented the interests of the ""ruling class"". Vested interests, and even criminals, had now become members of the CPM in many places, he said.

30,Power tariff may increase by 12 pc,"BANGALORE: The Karnataka Power Transmission Corporation (KPTC) has filed another petition for a ""mid-term"" hike in power tariff, which could mean about a 12 per cent hike in power rates for metered consumers.

KPTC managing director K.N. Shrivastava told The Times of India on Thursday that the hike was necessary as the utility had a shortfall of Rs 733 crore. ""This gap is due to our steep power purchase costs last year, following the failure of the monsoons. The Karnataka Electricity Regulatory Commission (KERC) had asked us to come back with details for financial year 2004, so we have submitted them,"" he outlined.

KPTC has also filed a formula for ""price adjustment"" according to variations in fuel and other factors, as per the Maharashtra model. A third petition was also filed to raise funds to pay the Rs 453 crore additional amount due to Tanir Bavi Power Company (TBPC).

Shrivastava said the KPTC was willing to keep some amount of its shortfall in abeyance as a regulatory asset to be passed on to next year''s tariff. ""Given the situation, the hike will probably have to be borne only by the metered consumers and it will be very steep,"" he added.

The KERC discussed the admissibility of the petition at a hearing, on the grounds that the KPTC had an appeal pending in the Karnataka High Court on the issue. ""But since the court has not given a stay, we said the issue could be discussed,"" Shrivastava said.

Another hearing on the petitions will be held after 10 days, he added.
