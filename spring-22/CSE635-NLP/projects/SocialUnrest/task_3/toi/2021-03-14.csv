2,HC hears arrested MLA's plea to attend House,"MUMBAI: The Bombay high court is likely to decide on Monday whether to permit incarcerated MLA Anil Gote to attend the threeday vote-on-account session commencing from March 15.

Gote''s counsel Satish Maneshinde argued for temporary bail on the grounds that the independent MLA, who is in judicial custody in the fake stamp-paper scam case, is not required for any immediate investigations.

He said narco-analysis and other tests would only be conducted late next month and there was no harm in letting Gote attend the session under police escort.

Maneshinde also argued that Gote stood to lose his membership in the state legislature if he did not attend the house for 60 days without leave of absence.

However, Raja Thakre, representing the Special Investigation Team probing the scam, opposed Gote''s plea.

5,'Workers want Barnala to head new party',"LUDHIANA:Wife of Andhra Pradesh governor Surjit Kaur Barnala, on Saturday, condemned Shiromani Akali Dal chief Parkash Singh Badal at a press conference here at Circuit house.

Surjit Kaur, who made a brief stop-over in Ludhiana, said that the party workers were unhappy with Badalâ€™s choice of candidates from Sangrur and Tarn Taran. She claimed that the workers had asked her husband Surjit Singh Barnala to â€˜â€˜lead a new partyâ€™â€™.

She said that the unhappy workers will not participate in the election till amendments were made. Surjit Kaur claimed that rebellion was brewing among the party workers. She condemned the Political Action Committeeâ€™s decision of handing over authority of nominating candidates to the party president. â€˜â€˜This would end up in Badal becoming a dictator,â€™â€™ Surjit Kaur said.

She claimed that no assessment had been made of the contenders in each constituency, which had caused a great deal of dissatisfaction to her husband and herself. Despite her husband having pointed out problems during his recent visit to Ludhiana, Badal had failed to take action or make amendments.

She said not nominating her husband from Sangrur constituency was not the done thing. She also criticised Akali leader Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa for opposing her husband in the last election, while questioning his nomination from Sangrur constituency. She, however, maintained that the Barnalas would not leave SAD.

Expressing his surprise over the haste shown in increasing import duty on beer, Modi said the RJD-led government is yet to announce its excise policy. He alleged that the government is also planning to reduce export duty on beer to extend more financial help to the firm. He did not rule out possibility of the beer firm donating fund to RJD.

Modi had said on Friday that the very fact that chief minister Rabri Devi and Laloo attended a dinner hosted by the chairman of Iceberg Industries on Wednesday spoke volumes about two top RJD leaders'' interest in the firm.

The leader of the opposition said administration ensured that the then local circle officer settled the land required to establish the firm in a single day, adding that Laloo himself laid foundation stone of the beer manufacturing unit about a year ago allegedly at the behest of the RJD MP, Prem Gupta.

12,Lotus on govt forms makes Cong see red,"NEW DELHI: Another poll-eve TV expose had the Congress on Sunday seeking Union Labour Minister Sahib Singh Vermaâ€™s resignation. The minister, however, dared the Opposition to prove any wrong-doing.

The Congress demanded the ministerâ€™s resignation, citing a TV channelâ€™s expose of the Mumbai BJP unit distributing application forms for the recently launched social security scheme for workers in the unorganised sector.

The footage captured by a hidden camera of the TV channel and telecast on Friday evening, showed forms with the BJPâ€™s lotus symbol and the partyâ€™s name printed on them being given out to people by some persons described as BJP members.

It was shown to the media at the AICC headquarters here by a party spokesperson who said the Congress would complain to the Election Commission because this amounted to â€˜â€˜open corruptionâ€™â€™ and violation of the model code of conduct.

Contacted by the TV channel, Verma said he did not see anything wrong in it.

â€˜â€˜There is no corruption involved in it. People are being misled,â€™â€™ he said adding that if the government had done something good, there was â€˜â€˜no harm in the BJP workers highlighting itâ€™â€™.

NCP president Sharad Pawar said the charge levelled by his poll ally, the Congress, was based on facts.

As regards Vermaâ€™s resignation, Pawar said he would not quit. â€˜â€˜We have to throw them out in the coming polls and we will do it.â€™â€™

Verma, on the other hand, told the TV channel that he was prepared to face any probe and dared Congress spokesperson Kapil Sibal to prove the charge against

him. â€˜â€˜If he can prove the charge against me, I will quit politics. Otherwise, Sibal should tender a public apology.â€™â€™

Verma contended that for the first time in 57 years, his partyâ€™s government has given social security to unorganised workers and denied that the BJP was interfering in it. It was, in fact, helping the poor.

Anybody could collect the forms and get them deposited, Verma added.

Taking strong exception to the distribution of the schemeâ€™s forms, Sibal said: â€˜â€˜Verma must go and he should be prosecuted. It

is a clear case of offence under the Prevention of Corruption Act. The CBI should take note of it and proceed in the matter.â€™â€™

He recalled that it was announced in the recent interim budget that all those workers in the unorganised sectors getting a salary of Rs 650 per month would have to contribute Rs 50 or Rs 100 a month depending on their age for the social security scheme.

But the BJP took all the forms from the authorities in Mumbai and printed their partyâ€™s symbol and name and distributed them among the workers, he alleged.
