0,Dumka teachers to campaign against govt,"DUMKA: Peeved with the insensitivity of the government towards their genuine demands, the Siddhu Kanhu University Teachers Co-ordination Committee, an umbrella organisation of the teachers associations of different colleges, has decided to adopt a novel means of protest which will neither hamper the classes nor create any hurdle in functioning of the university. They will fight the government politically.

Having lost patience with the dilly-dallying tactics of the Jharkhand government over payment of the new UGC pay scale -- barring Bihar, other states implemented it four years ago, the teachers have decided that whereever the ruling party will contest election, the teachers would campaign against it.

For the last one week, the teachers are on dharna in the university premises demanding payment of UGC pay scale and the salary of strike period. They allege that despite written agreement, the Jharkhand government, on the instigation of arrogant bureaucrats, is declining to abide by that. According to the agreement, the striking teachers were to be given the salary of strike period of three months if they compensated the loss of teaching. The teachers fulfilled the condition, but the Jharkhand government is yet to keep its word.

The co-ordination committee is planning to organise public meetings and narrate their plight before students and their guardians. ""If we speak against the ruling party, it will definitely have some impact,"" Dr Gopal Kumar Singh said.

1,PUCL censures govt over land distribution,"PATNA: State unit of the Peopleâ€™s Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL) has censured the state government for failing to get Dalits in Sitamarhi the possession of ceiling land, alleging that the land is illegally occupied by public relations minister Sitaram Yadav and his family members.

A report released by the PUCL on Sunday said that despite the statement of land and revenue ministerâ€™s statement inside the legislature that 90 per cent of Dalits had been given land documents, they still did not have the possession of the land. The report was prepared by PUCL general secretaries Kishori Das and Surendra Kumar. The report maintained that the ceiling of the land was illegally registered in the name of the wife of the public relations minister. They pointed out that 2.07 acres of ceiling land had been illegally transferred with the connivance of the minister, land officer and circle officer and that the local administration had done nothing to give possession of land to the Dalits. They charged that the land revenue minister had mislead the House. The PUCL also pointed out that agitations by the downtrodden were brutally dealt with by the government machinery and that it was ""an obvious case of illegal political interference"".

The PUCL maintained that around 225 acres of ceiling land had been distributed by successive CMs at Nanpur block of Sitamarhi district. It said the public relations minister and his relatives had taken illegal possession of the distributed land in Kharka block and used his influence to frame the agitating Dalits in false cases and also indulged in atrocities on their leaders.

2,Ensure pure drinking water: HC to govt,"PATNA: The Patna High Court on Monday took a serious view of the failure of the stateâ€™s civic agencies to supply pure drinking water in various localities of the state capital. A division bench comprising Justice Nagendra Rai and Justice R S Garg directed the commissioner-cum-secretary, urban development department, to produce on Tuesday the periodic report about the chlorination of drinking water.

The directive was issued on the contempt petition of the Council for Protection of Public Rights and Welfare. The council has been highlighting the water pollution issue for many years. Earlier, a writ petition of the council in this regard had been disposed of in 1990, and a subsequent contempt petition was filed in 1994.

The councilâ€™s lawyer, M P Gupta, pleaded that the secretary, urban development department, had assured the court in August, 1994, that the chlorination of drinking water through a non-mechanical process would be done continuously. This was to be done in accordance with the provisions of the Patna Water Board (Water Supply) Rules, the secretary had stated in an affidavit in 1994, Gupta argued. But due to the failure of the Patna Water Board (PWB) to ensure safe drinking water supply there was an outbreak of waterborne diseases in different localities, particularly in Kankarbagh, he added.

The court also directed the secretary, minor irrigation department, to be present on Tuesday to explain why his department did not bid for the drilling of 45 borewells in Patna.

The court directive came when the Patna Water Board counsel submitted that the contract for borings had been given to the Uttar Pradesh Jal Nigam after floating tenders.

A senior lawyer, Basant Kumar Chaudhary, and some other lawyers stated that since the ground water division of the state minor irrigation department did the boring work, the water board ought to have given the work to this state governmentâ€™s wing.

The water board counsel said that the minor irrigation department had not bid for this work.

The court made it clear that it would order a CBI inquiry if any irregularity was found with regard to drinking water supply and ending the waterlogging problem.

4,"Power cuts lead to violence, 2 cops hurt","LUCKNOW: Violence broke out at KGMC crossing when residents protesting against the three-day-long power failure began to misbehave with the police force deployed at the site where repair work was underway.

The mob attacked the police force leaving two constables injured while the personal scooter of a head constable was set ablaze. In the cane charge that followed, half a dozen protesters suffered injuries. It was around 11 pm when residents of Raja Bazar locality collected at the KGMC crossing sub-station were repair work was being carried out under police protection as residents had threatened to storm the unit. When the policemen tried to stop them, violence broke out. Later, PAC was deployed in the area to contain further trouble.

Earlier, the harried people held a power sub-station staff hostage from about 9 pm on Sunday to about 2 am on Monday to protest the prolonged power cut. They lifted the siege when power supply in their locality was restored through an alternative source.

According to reports, the Raza Bazar locality was not getting power supply since Saturday after some fault in the cable. Despite repeated complaints of the residents no official or staff of the Lucknow Electricity Supply Administration attended their complaints. When the patience of the residents gave way they collected on Sunday evening in large number but found that no official was present at the sub-station. The restive crowd stormed into the office, damaged the furniture and records.

On receiving the information that an officer was at the Aishbagh sub-station, some of the residents rushed there and brought him to the medical college sub-station and held him hostage. The police were called and senior LESA officials also rushed to the spot and arranged the power for the locality by diverting it from other sub-stations.

5,Govt orders probe into arrests,"KOLKATA: The state government has formed a committee headed by the special secretary (home) to probe the circumstances leading to the suicide of Abhijit Sinha.

The decision was taken by the CPM leadership, stung by the public criticism following Sinhaâ€™s death. ""It is being alleged that the professor (Kaushik Ganguly) was beaten in lock-up and Sinha committed suicide because he had been tortured by the police. The government should initiate a detailed inquiry into both the incidents,"" said CPM politburo member Biman Bose.

Bose, however, said, ""There have been several murders in Midnapore in recent times. If the arrested are found to be connected with the planning of these murders, then they can be arrested,"" he said.

Meanwhile, the Trinamul Congress has demanded the resignation of Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee as state home minister. Trinamul leader Pankaj Banerjee said that Bhattacharjee should also apologise to Sinhaâ€™s widow. He is leading a four-member delegation to Salboni on Tuesday to meet Kaushik Ganguly and look into the allegations of torture.

His party colleague Partha Chatterjee compared the situation with the terror during the Siddhartha Shankar Ray regime. ""The recent spate of arrests remind us of the late Sixties and early Seventies. The hyperactive police is responsible for spreading the menace out of Midnapore throughout West Bengal. What is the difference between the much-maligned Runu Guha Neogi and Buddhadeb Bhattacharjeeâ€™s police officers?"" he asked.

An effort by Chatterjee to bring an adjournment motion in the Assembly was turned down by the Speaker. The motion demanded a statement by the chief minister and punishment for police officers resorting to torture. Trinamul MLA staged a walk-out when higher education minister Satya-sadhan Chakrabarty did not make a statement on Gangulyâ€™s arrest.

The Pradesh Congress also condemned the arrests and demanded a statement from the chief minister on the floor of the House. Still bearing the baggage of police crackdown on the Naxalites in the Seventies, PCC general secretary Manas Bhuiyan said the crackdown on PW was a ""serious law-and-order problem"".

Teachers, students and employees of Rajabazar Science College wore black badges protesting Gangulyâ€™s arrest and torture. A convention of college teachers has been called on Tuesday.

6,All-party team leaves for Delhi sans Trinamul,"KOLKATA: A 16-member delegation led by transport minister Subhas Chakraborty left for Delhi on Monday to meet railway minister Nitish Kumar on Tuesday to discuss the controversy arising out of bifurcation of Eastern Railway.

Sticking to its earlier stand, the main Opposition group in the Assembly, Trinamul Congress, however, kept away from the delegation, arguing that a meeting with the railway minister was futile as he has become a party to the controversy.

But the delegationâ€™s departure was not without its attendant drama. Despite his partyâ€™s decision not to join the delegation, Trinamul MLA Saugata Roy left for Delhi on Sunday, travelling on a ticket purchased as a member of the all-party delegation.

The point was raised by CPM MLA Rabin Deb in the House, leading to a major embarrassment for the party. Later, leader of Opposition Pankaj Banerjee explained that Roy had done so because he was not aware of the partyâ€™s decision to stay away from the delegation. ""Roy has gone for his own work and we will ask him to return the money after he comes back,"" Banerjee told reporters.

Speaker Hasim Abdul Halim, meanwhile, said that he had no formal communication that the Trinamul was not part of the delegation. Halim, however, admitted that both Pankaj Banerjee and Sobhandeb Chattopadhyay had returned their tickets. ""We hope Saugata Roy joins the delegation in Delhi,"" Halim remarked.

On the railway bifurcation issue, chief whip Lakhmi Dey said that as it involved the entire state, a request was made to all the MPs from the state to be present when the delegation met the railway minister. Rebel Trinamul MP Ajit Panja reportedly said that he will be present when the delegation meets Nitish Kumar.

The GNLF also stayed away from the all-party delegation as party MLAs had prior engagements in the city.

7,BNCCI ‘strike’ floors political big brothers,"KOLKATA: All of you claim that you are working for the benefit of the common people and give strike calls on their behalf. Go and ask any 10 people on the streets whether they are in favour of strikes and all of them will answer in the negative. Then, how can you justify a strike call?The question was put to Left Front chairman Biman Bose, Congress leader Pradip Bhattacharya, Trinamul Congress MLA Sobhandeb Chattopadhyay and BJP state president Asim Ghosh by a member of the Bengal National Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Kolkata on Monday. The leaders refused to comment. Members of BNCCI met the leaders on the issue 'Bandh is detrimental to industrial growth'. However, in spite of all their efforts, the members could not obtain a resolution from the leaders to refrain from calling bandhs (except under exceptional circumstances) on normal working days. The Left Front chairman, however, said that he would ask the state government to hold meetings with Opposition leaders, trade unionists and industrialists to discuss ways of industrial resurgence in West Bengal. The Left Front seeks help from all political parties in the state to discuss industrialisation. The right to strike should not be taken away from workers but strike should be the last resort, Bose said.However, all the leaders agreed that bandhs are used more as a political weapon than anything else.

8,Suspect suicide shocks state,"KOLKATA: Mystery has been added to the murmur over the arrest of alleged Naxalites following the suicide of Abhijit Sinha, 33, a customs inspector, who threw himself before a running train at Dum Dum on Sunday evening. He was one of the youths picked up over the past week for suspected links with the Peopleâ€™s War. IG (law and order) Chayan Mukherjee said on Monday an inquiry has been ordered into the arrests.

Sinha did not leave behind any suicide note. He was â€œarrestedâ€� on Thursday night and taken to the Baguiati investigation centre, allegedly because his name and telephone number were found in the diary of a suspected Naxalite. His father-in-law Moloy Sinha, a DSP in the CID, was allowed to take him away after interrogation. The DSP gave an undertaking he would be produced before West Midnapore ASP A. Srinivasan the next day.

Sinhaâ€™s interrogation there also did not apparently yield much â€œintelligenceâ€� and the DSP was allowed to escort him back to Kolkata. Sinha claimed on Monday the ASP had told him Sinha was innocent.

Sinha was a nervous wreck after his return from Midnapore. His relatives said any knock at the door or the ring of the telephone would frighten him and he appeared scared of strangers.

While his relatives are understandably bitter about police high-handedness, several theories have been offered by investigating officers about the suicide. It is possible, they said, that Sinha had divulged information following sustained interrogation, or he had come to know that other detainees had been arrested had provided information about his own activities. Some of them volunteered that he was unable to accept the humiliation of â€œarrestâ€� and had panicked when the ASP apparently sent word that he wanted to interrogate him further.

Sources, however, said that though Sinha might have escaped assault, he was made to witness the torture of others, which caused his breakdown.

Sinha was picked up during a major swoop on Thursday along with a lecturer of Rajabazar Science College and a student of Presidency College, among others. Even political circles claim to be baffled over their arrest and wonder if carrying Left radical literature, discussing the political situation or sharing tea with political activists or friends could bring down on â€œinnocentâ€� people the heavy hand of the law. They are even more shocked this should happen in West Bengal, where the communists in power were at the receiving end of â€œrepressionâ€� let loose by the Congress government earlier.

Meanwhile, the West Bengal Human Rights Commission ordered a probe after receiving petitions from the mothers of Kaushik Ganguly and Tinku Ghosh and Parashar Bhattacharyaâ€™s father on Monday.

9,Assam seeks incentives for power reforms,"GUWAHATI: After having consented to the Power Ministry''s scheme for one time settlement of dues of Assam State Electricity Board (ASEB) towards various power sector Central Public Sector Units (CPSUs) the state government has asked the Union Power Minister Suresh P Prabhu to consider special financial incentives for Assam.

The Assam Power Minister Devanand Konwar in a DO addressed to the Union Power Minister informed him that the state has already started the process of reforms in the power sector with a strong thrust on electricity distribution and also payment of huge dues to various agencies for which they have also signed a Tripartite Agreement as required by the Power Ministry under the securitisation scheme.

He informed the Union minister that they have also opened the Letter of Credit for payment of current billing to various CPSUs under the scheme and filed its Tariff Petition before Assam Electricity Regulatory Commission all within the month of June 2002.

Assam Power Minister also stated that though all efforts are being made to reduce the T&D and other commercial losses in 2001-2002 were over 40% but ""it would be unrealistic to expect that the level of T&D losses incurred by the ASEB, as in the case of other State Electricity Boards all over the country, would be wiped out instantly.""

He said taking into account the measures taken by the state government and the ASEB in this direction it will take at least two years during which the ASEB''s cash losses are expected to show a significant decline but the scheme of securitisation does not provide any special relief to northeastern states.

Konwar said since the power sector will have a material bearing on the overall financial health of the state, ""there is clearly a need for special assistance for northeastern states to help them reform their respective power sectors."" He hoped that taking due consideration of the measures taken by the state government and the ASEB in this sector they were hopeful of a positive response from the ministry.

He said since the scheme of securitisation provides for 60% waiver of the surcharge payable to CPSUs for the states accepting the scheme it will be of great help to the northeastern states if the remaining 40% amounting to nearly Rs.196 crores can also be converted into special one-time transition grant by the GoI.

Konwar has suggested that this proposed one time grant of Rs.196 crores could be adjusted against out standings towards the CPSUs amounting to Rs. 120 crores for the period between 1st October 2001 and 31st March 2002 while the balance of Rs. 76 crores can be provided to GoA/ASEB as part of the Special Transition Assistance to enable to meet its reforms agenda agreed as per MoU with the GoI and the scheme of securitisation.

He said to enable the ASEB to reduce its fixed liability on account of salary etc. assistance of about Rs. 231 crores be provided over three years, as per VRS scheme already forwarded by ASEB and GoA to Planning Commission along with special technical assistance to the ASEB for training and redeployment of its staff and for organizational capacity building to meet the challenge of reforms.

12,Nitish seeking political gains on ER bifurcation: Trinamul,"KOLKATA: Continuing its tirade against Railway Minister Nitish Kumar, the Trinamul Congress on Tuesday accused him of politicking on the Eastern Railway bifurcation which, it said, would only lead to a rift between West Bengal and Bihar.

As part of its agitation against the bifurcation, the Trinamul Youth Congress demonstrated before the Eastern Railway headquarters.

Addressing the demonstrators, Trinamul policy-making body Chairman and opposition leader Pankaj Banerjee accused the Railway minister of taking a unilateral decision on the bifurcation leading to tension between the two neighbouring states.

Claiming that the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister were concerned about the situation stemming from the bifurcation, he said his party would not accept it.

TC Chief Whip in Lok Sabha Sudip Bandopadhyay, a member of the Parliamentary Consultative Committee attached to the Railway ministry, alleged that no discussion was held in the committee on the bifurcation.

He claimed that even the CAG had opposed the bifurcation of Eastern Railway.

Referring to criticism that TC chief Mamata Banerjee during her tenure as Railway minister, had not taken any step to stall the bifurcation, Bandopadhyay said he had raised the issue twice at the meeting of the Union Cabinet.

13,"NC will have smooth sailing during polls, say moderates","SRINAGAR: With the growing militant threat against joining polls, the moderates within separatist groups in Jammu and Kashmir has offered smooth sailing for the ruling National Conference in the forthcoming assembly elections.

Joining the United Jihad Council of Pakistan asking Hurriyat and others to launch anti-election campaign in the state, Saif-ul-Islam, Hizbul Mujahideen operational commander based in Kashmir criticized Hurriyat leaders for asking Syed Salahuddin to return and lead anti-election campaign.

The HM chief said Salahuddin has spent most part of life in Kashmir and had started the struggle here. In a statement the Hizb operation chief said the people of Kashmir do not want elections but right to self-determination. He asked Hurriyat to start anti-election campaign and if it failed to discharge their responsibility then they will hand over the political leaders to others, Islam added in a statement to a local news agency on Monday.

The latest Hizb move has sent shivers down the moderates among the separatist groups. Abdul Majid Dar, expelled HM chief, Shabir Ahmad Shah, president Peoples Democratic freedom party, Hashmi Qureshi, Firdous Baba, militant turned politician have all refused to take part in the upcoming elections at least of now. For National parties like congress, which is plagued by the internal dissension has lost its important members to National Conference in Jammu even.

The sources said R S Sharma, a sitting Congress MLA from Kalkot constituency is to join ruling National Conference in coming days after some strain in the relations with new state congress chief Gulam Nabi Azad. Most of the senior congress leaders including Mohammad Shafi Qureshi, Rafi Sadiq, Abdul Gani Vakil and Tariq Mohi-ud-din abstained from congress rally here on Monday.

The leaders blamed the state congress chief for having ignored the right persons in district and block level committees recently. The dissented group is expected to leave for Delhi soon to apprise the AICC president Sonia Gandhi about the developments. All this and growing militant to separatist leaders against participation in the upcoming elections, president ruling national conference Omar Abdullah was expressed his confidence of winning elections in the state without any tough resistance.

At a public meeting in Doda in Jammu division on Monday, Omar said even if presidents rule is imposed in the state prior to the polls as demanded by our adversaries, NC will win hands down as it has done in the past, he added.

14,Sangh to float outfit to contest J&K polls,"NEW DELHI: The Sangh Parivar, the Akali Dal and the Panthers Party may join hands to float a new front to contest the Jammu & Kashmir assembly elections with the sole agenda of statehood for Jammu. If the central BJP does not agree to the Jammu unit''s plea to join the front, the Sangh may even decide to go ahead without the BJP, said sources.

The Jammu unit of the BJP is expected to meet the central leadership in a week''s time to press for the central BJP''s permission to join the new RSS sponsored front.

But those opposed to the RSS proposal of trifurcation have mooted a three-point compromise formula. ``Around two lakh parliament voters who cannot vote in the assembly elections should be made state subjects. The Resettlement Act and the separate Constitution should be scrapped. If the National Conference agrees to all three proposals then the front would be a non-starter and the NDA would be strengthened,'''' said a source.

Though the RSS in its recently concluded national executive had passed a resolution for the trifurcation of the J&K, deputy Prime Minister LK Advani refused to accept the RSS proposal.

Interestingly the RSS emissaries have even been talking to the local Congress unit about the front, but the Congress has not responded to the RSS proposal. The RSS representation in the new front would come from Jammu & Kashmir Nationalist Front, which was formed much before the RSS had finalised its stand on trifurcation.

The JKNF convenor is Tilak Raj Sharma, a former RSS pracharak and a former president of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad local unit. His co-convenor Yash Bhasin too is a former pracharak. Though JKNF was floated as a pressure group by the Sangh to seek a separate state for Jammu, now, the idea is to merge the JKNF in the new front Akalis and the Panthers party.

The new front has been modelled on the Samyukta Maharashtra Samiti that was formed in 1956 with the Communits, the Jan Sangh, the Socialists and the peasants party. Though the Samiti lost to the Congress, the pressure worked and the state was formed in 1960.

In the last Ladakh Hill Council elections, the Congress had supported the union territory status for Ladakh and had won with a landslide majority. The RSS might float a separate front for Ladakh too.

15,6 hurt in Gomtipur riots,"AHMEDABAD: After a long spell of calm, communal violence once again gripped the Gomtipur area of the city late on Monday. Groups from both the communities resorted to stone-pelting at the Rajpur toll naka area. Six persons were injured in the incident. The police had to fire tear-gas shells to disperse the warring mobs.

Following this violence, the city police have stepped up patrolling in the tense localities.

At around 10.30 pm, a mob of about 500 people gathered lining the Popatiawad square at Gomtipur and attacked each other with stones and sticks. However, the police soon reached the spot and took control of the situation.

A local resident, Ashokbhai Parmar, said: ""There was some trouble between two drunkards near the Popatiawad. The verbal duel soon started taking a communal shape. However, before the situation could worsen, the police reached the spot and brought things under control.""

A list of eight (four from each community) accused, who may have been behind this outbreak of communal violence in Gomtipur, has also been drawn up, according to the police. Arrests are expected soon.

According to the Gomtipur police, ""Gomtipur''s social fabric is such that the communities are often at loggerheads even over petty issues. This is a hyper-sensitive zone. We are investigating into the matter. Once the accused are in custody, the reason behind this rioting will become more clear.""

I along with guardians of these students went to Chauhan''s office and requested him to return the amount.

19,More arrests of PW leaders on cards: Police,"ASANSOL: Former colleagues of Abhijit Sinha at the Central Excise and Customs department here were stunned that their former colleague had committed suicide, unable to bear the insult of police torture following his arrest on the charge of having links with Peopleâ€™s War.

They thought it was a typical instance of police high-handedness. Some of them said on Tuesday that there was nothing suspicious about his activities during his tenure as an inspector in that office in 1998.

IGP (Western Range) Jitram Bhagat, in charge of Midna-pore West, said that the chief minister had already ordered a probe. He also claimed that there was enough evidence to implicate Kaushik Ganguly, Tinku Ghosh and Parasar Bhattacharya for their links with PW. Though the arrested persons had brilliant academic backgrounds, that was the trend, too, during the turbulent 1970s.

Incidentally, Gurupada Kar, a lecturer of nuclear physics at the Indian Statistical Institute in Kolkata, was arrested by the Asansol police for his alleged PW links. Recently, the police have filed a chargesheet on that case. One Dipanjan Mukherjee of Baguiati was arrested from the Poorva Express in 1998 with detonators from Chittaranjan station meant for Naxalites in Midnapore and he revealed Karâ€™s name to the police. Midnapore West police have seized two cellphones from them and the cards would be checked, he added. The arrested have even links with COMPOSA, a subcontinental Maoist forum, asserted Bhagat.

""The arrested Kaushik Ganguly of Rajabazar Science College is the policy-maker of PW in the state,"" he told TNN. Some more senior PW leaders including professors and doctors would be arrested, informed sources.

Kartik Pal, chief of state CPI(ML)-Liberation demnaded on Tuesday that the guilty police officers be punished immediately as the CM himself admitted that there was no evidence against Sinha.

Veteran Naxalite leader Mahadeb Mukherjee said that the police have remained the same though governments have changed.

20,Vengsarkar protests against Matunga Gymkhana pavilion,"MUMBAI: Former Indian cricket captain Dilip Vengsarkar has objected to the permission granted by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to the Matunga Gymkhana for constructing a pavilion on a playground opposite Ruia College in Matunga.The Matunga Gymkhana building is built on half of the total area of the recreation ground leased by the BMC as per a government notification issued in September 2000. According to the lease policy, the Gymkhana authorities are supposed to keep open the remaining half of the recreation ground.The ground is mostly used by cricketers, and practice nets are affixed all over the ground. However, the pavilion, approximately measuring 35 feet by 15 feet, is being built in an area, which Mr Vengsarkar claims, is meant to be kept open.An official from the Gymkhana said that the construction was authorised and the pavilion was meant for the cricketers who play on the ground. But Mr Vengsarkar claimed that no ground in Mumbai had concrete structures in almost the centre of the ground for cricketers.The cricketers can always change in the club. Why is there any need for a pavilion?'' He expressed reservations over the claim of the Gymkhana authorities that the pavilion would be kept open for cricketers who might not be the members of their club. Will the authorities allow other cricketers in the pavilion?'' he asked.An official of the building proposal department which granted permission for the construction of the pavilion said the entire ground was leased to the Gymkhana. As per the policy 50 per cent of the land can be constructed whereas another 50 per cent should be kept open. The authorities constructed a club house using only 40 per cent of the land on the northern side of the plot and used the remaining 10 per cent close to the pitch for the construction of a pavilion.''The officer added, Since not more than 50 per cent of the land was being constructed upon, we approved their proposal of building a pavilion near the ground as it would benefit the cricketers.'' He said that the pavilion belonged to the Gymkhana authorities and they reserved rights to deny access to non-members.

21,Non-Cong rule has eroded values in politics: Munna,"LUCKNOW: ""The rule of non-Congress parties in UP has led to a steady deterioration of higher values in public life. The rival parties have facilitated an easy passage to criminals and non-political fixers in the political mainstream, with the result that committed workers with loyalty and sound integrity stand sidelined today,"" said Arun Kumar Singh Munna on Tuesday. The UPCC president was addressing his first press conference here.Munna lambasted the short-cut measures to reach the top slot, which has become the favoured modus operandi of all major political parties. ""If one party plays up Mandal against kamandal, another tries to cash in on the social justice issue. The situation has resulted in opportunistic alliance of ayarams and gayarams who have nothing in common but the greed for power,"" he said.The Congress Party, he said, subscribed to a different ideology as Congressmen still believed in probity and constructive opposition. ""We are not in the race for power but for reinforcing the rule of law and democratic norms,"" he said. There should be an end to the era of turncoats and self-seekers to reinforce public faith in the political system, he said.He stressed upon the need to carry on the sadak ki ladai. ""Nothing like confrontations to draw public attention and win their confidence -- lathi-charge hona chahiye, said Munna, who time and again waxed eloquent about his Youth Congress days. The UPCC chief, in his inimitable fashion, regaled mediapersons with his `strategies' which brought him much success as a youth leader. The number of Congress workers courting arrest during 1977, he claimed, used to be more than a lakh. ""So sangharsh ki rajniti was the key to power,"" he claimed and added that this message should go down the line in the party.In reply to a query about the measures to check party feuds, Munna said ""Congressmen today have plenty of time on their hands. All the intrigues and feuds that you see around is the result of too much of time and too little occupation. So I will keep every one so busy that they would have no time for anything else.""There would be far-reaching changes in the party organisation, he said adding that he would bring in a few new faces as well.

23,Several injured in group clash,"KANPUR: At least half a dozen persons suffered serious injuries in a clash between two rival groups in Budhanpur village in Chaubepur police circle on Tuesday morning.

Both the rival groups freely exchanged bricks, canes and even opened fire to create a sense of supremacy in the area. Reportedly one person identified as Babboo suffered gun shot injuries and was found missing from the village after the incident.

The series of incidents took place when two rival groups of Raghuveer and Babboo came to loggerheads following an old enmity. Both the groups levelled charges at each other for disturbing the peace in the area. Raghuveer was of the view that one Ram Vikas was caught red-handed while stealing an electric motor from a farm house in Tatyaganj locality where the son of Raghuveer Yadav was posted as a watchman. Later a case had also been registered in connection with the incident. He added that rival groups attacked them when they were sitting in their field.

On other hand, Ramadhar from another group was of the view that he was assembling villagers at the behest of the gram pradhan of Gadheva village for the welcome ceremony of the state BJP chief. He added that he had sent Nanhe Yadav and Babboo to bring tractors so that the villagers would be able to reach the city. Meanwhile, Raghuveer along with his son Nanhe came to him and asked him not to leave the village for the welcome ceremony. When he refused to consider their demand, they attacked his supporters with bricks, canes and even fired bullets.

The police said that clash was the result of groupism which created panic in the village. The police also added that Babboo suffered gun shot injuries and had been missing from the village since the incident. It was also reported that Babboo and Ram Singh had a criminal background. Reportedly 13 persons from both groups had been taken into custody.

24,No bandh for Bacchus flock,"ANKIT SRIVASTAVALUCKNOW: With cracks in the trader community widening over the Lucknow bandh issue, a number of citizens in the capital showed their solidarity and unity over a definite common concern: a collective love for liquor. If there was any shop one could find open in Lucknow during the bandh, it was the liquor shop.While the bandh itself was enforced partially, all these shops did brisk business, operating almost unhindered. Be it Nadarganj on the outskirts of the city or Aishbagh, there was no one to bother them over the closure issue.Such is the collective might of Bacchus in the city, that in areas where other `routine' shops were forced to close down and high end goods cooled their heels inside closed shutters, members of the traders association chose to ignore liquor shops. Be it the government Indian Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL) vends, beer shops or the much maligned country liquor `thekas' -- all held aloft their banners. With the sweltering heat in the day, chilled beer was in additional demand.However, in some areas, the half-shuttered shops managed to hastily dispense goods to harried consumers. Moreover, normalcy was restored as the evening progressed, with the `thirsty' returning to their favourite watering holes.The story was entirely different in country shops, that lacked even a semblance of anxiety. As regards security problems, a visibly swaying proprietor stated: Yahan kaha bandh hai; police security hai, jab chaho, jab tak chaho milegi. Adding Harivansh Rai Bacchan's memorable verse for good measure: Jaha kahi mil baithe hum tum, wahin kahi hai madhushala.

26,Selection of science teachers set aside,"CHANDIGARH: Punjab Lok Pal Justice (retd.) DV Sehgal has set aside appointment of all the 100 science teachers made during the SAD-BJP governmentâ€™s tenure and indicted former education minister Tota Singh and district education officer Raj Singh Deol for their gross misconduct in â€œadopting crude and clumsy device of selecting favoured ones and callously overlooking meritâ€� in the selections.

The Lok Pal, in his verdict on complaints filed by Ramandeep Kaur and Nisha Arora, who were not able to make it to the final selection lists inspite of their brilliant academic record, also cast severe aspersions on the â€œacumen and qualificationsâ€� of four other members of the selection committee. He observed that â€œthey were actuated by improper motives and personal interestâ€�.

The Lok Pal recommended that as the selection to the post of science mistresses (medical) were not made on merit, but for â€˜â€˜collateral and extraneous considerationsâ€�, they should be cancelled forthwith adopting appropriate legal course.

While suggesting the entire selection process be conducted afresh, he wanted that applications of all the 500 candidates, who were shortlisted on the basis of merit, should be scrutinised by the director, public instructions (schools) by reference to their testimonials before calling them for interview. The state-level selection committee should comprise a chairman, who should either be head of the education (secondary) department, or the DPI (schools).

The Lok Pal, however, left to the state government to decide what disciplinary action it would take against the DEO and other members of the selection committee for their misconduct.
