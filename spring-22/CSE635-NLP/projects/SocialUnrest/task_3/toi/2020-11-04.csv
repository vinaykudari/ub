0,CBI arrests man for jumping bail,"NEW DELHI: The Central Bureau of Investigation has recently arrested a person who jumped an interim bail. Zulfikar Ali, accused of impersonating a CBI officer and cheating a person of about Rs 1.62 lakh, had sought bail for getting his wife treated.

Ali was apprehended in Mumbai on October 24. He was arrested by the Mumbai police while posing as a CBI inspector.

The investigating agency had registered a case against Ali on June 27, 2001. A businessman had claimed that Ali had promised to arrange an arms licence for him, which would be valid in India as well as abroad. Ali had also promised the complainant that he would get a Japanese pistol from the â€˜â€˜VIP quota of CBI.â€™â€™

When Ali did not deliver the pistol or the licence, the complainant approached the CBI. After registering a case, the CBI apprehended the suspect from Gautam Buddha Nagar on July 22, 2001.

During his interrogation, Ali confessed to have cheated several persons by posing as a CBI officer for 5-6 years. Raids in his residence led to the recovery of several incriminating documents as well as some fake blank identity cards of CBI.

2,Naidu's ministers prefer early polls,"HYDERABAD: A majority of the cabinet ministers were said to prefer an early election even as chief minister Chandrababu Naidu began a quiet opinion-gathering exercise on calling a vote some time in Feb-March next year.

While sources in the TDP said opinion in the party is still divided on an early election, there were indications on Tuesday that the chief minister is nearing a decision, which may be more tangibly signalled in the next few days.

Political circles were agog with speculation that Naidu will announce a decision on dissolution of the Assembly in a weekâ€™s time.

While a majority of the TDP leaders, particularly those angling for tickets, are in favour of an early election, there are several naysayers who argue that the chief minister would have no convincing reason to give to the electorate for advancing the elections.

They are pointing out that the â€˜sympathyâ€™ generated after the naxalite attack on Naidu last month would have evaporated by voting day. Therefore, the chief minister is better advised to run out his term and use the rest of his tenure to give momentum to as many welfare schemes as possible.

Those in favour of early elections argue that this is the time to make a dash for the winning post because there is no great antiincumbency feeling among voters. â€œThe electorate is not in a mood to pull down the government even though there might be some minor lapses in governance,â€� a senior minister told The Times of India.

Surveys conducted by Naiduâ€™s pollsters have also not indicated any adverse mood among the voters, barring local dissatisfaction against legislators, a top official said.

Publicly, however, TDP spokesmen continued to be coy, denying that the thought of early polls was on their leaderâ€™s mind but leaving room for speculation that the party was flirting with the question.

TDP spokesmen C Ramachandraiah and Umareddy Venkateswarulu went to great lengths to persuade reporters on Tuesday that the only polls that Chandrababu Naidu discussed over lunch with Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani and BJP president M Venkaiah Naidu on Sunday were those scheduled for late Nov-early Dec in five northern states. However, asked if the ruling party would, therefore, rule out any possibility of an early election, the spokesmen said the government had the constitutional right to dissolve the Assembly and call a vote at any time of its choosing.

Regardless of the outcome of the mulling in Naiduâ€™s mind, his ministers continued to barnstorm the state laying foundation stones and inaugurating new programmes.

3,Four medical colleges lack teachers; blame it on rules,"BANGALORE: In four medical colleges in Karnataka, over 300 posts of teaching staff are lying vacant and have remained so for several years.

Reason: inordinate delay in amendment of cadre and recruitment (C&R) rules to comply with Medical Council of India (MCI) regulations. While MCI specifies a PG degree qualification for teachers holding different posts starting from lecturers, assistant and associate professors and professors, the governmentâ€™s C&R rules specify an MBBS qualification.

Pending amendment, the recruitment process lies frozen. Surprisingly, the medical education department is yet to ascertain the number of staff vacancies.

â€œWe are redrawing the vacancy list. A meeting slated this week will help us get accurate figures,â€™â€™ director of medical education Sheela G. Nayak said.

The Karnataka Health and Family Planning Services (collegiate branch) Recruitment Rules, 1967, were last amended in 1984. Despite the MCI making PG mandatory for a teacher, the government did not attempt amendment.

Medical education minister A.B. Maalaka Raddy said the government published the draft amended C&R rules in conformity with MCI regulations and invited objections. â€œIt is surprising none of the governments initiated amendment of rules.â€™â€™

The government is thinking of giving two-year extension to retiring teachers as a temporary reprieve. â€œMCI regulations allow teachers to work till 60 years, and there is no harm in asking them to continue for two more years,â€™â€™ RGUHS registrar K.M. Sreenivasa Gowda said.

5,Plan panel okays NGO-watch policy,"NEW DELHI: The Planning Commission has cleared a new national policy on the voluntary sector. If the policy is approved by the cabinet, NGOs will be expected to raise funds in the form of donations or user charges for the development work they undertake in partnership with the government.

â€˜â€˜These funds may even be used for the maintenance of the infrastructure created by the government,â€™â€™ said an official.

The new policy will provide the doâ€™s and donâ€™ts for NGOs working with the government on various developmental projects.

The policy will comprise a list of NGOs, whose credentials have been verified by the government. â€˜â€˜The state governments can refer to this list when they are short-listing NGOs for any development project,â€™â€™ said an official.

For transfer of public funds, the government will grade the NGOs and fix their financial limits. This will be done in consultation with members of the NGO. The new policy also proposes to suitably amend the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act to facilitate clearance of funds.

â€˜â€˜While keeping a check on them, the policy aims at encouraging the involvement of NGOs in public service institutions like schools, vocational training centres, family welfare centres and hospitals,â€™â€™ the official said.

Informal associations like youth clubs, self-help groups and mahila mandals will have to register themselves with the local administration or any higher authority. â€˜â€˜Care will be taken to ensure that the registration process is user-friendly and non-regulatory if public funds are not accessed,â€™â€™ the policy says.

To ensure that volunteers receive respect and cooperation from government officials and the community, a model charter of volunteer rights and privileges will be drawn up in the new policy. All arms of the government and public institutions will have to adopt this charter.

Under the new policy, consultative forums will be set up in the state governments as well as the Planning Commission to collaborate with the NGOs.

Coordination committees will also be set up at the Central, state and the district levels. These will look into the grievances that the NGOs may have. Other issues pertaining to their work, particularly implementation of projects, can also be taken up by these committees.

The Central and state governments will also institute awards for NGOs that have done well in their respective fields.

6,"Peasants, youths take out rally, hold meetingPeasants, youths take out rally, hold meeting","PATNA: Peasants and youths from eastern states of Bihar, Jharkhand, Orissa, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal, organised under the banner of Samajwadi Jan Parishad (SJP), took out a rally from Gandhi Maidan here on Tuesday.

The peasants and the youths were shouting slogans seeking remunerative prices for the farmers'' produce, the waiver of loans of farmers and agricultural labourers, charging simple interest on bank loan given to farmers and payment of Rs 1,000 as social security allowance to each and every unemployed youth of the country.

After parading through the main thoroughfares of the town, the rally turned into a public meeting at the sprawling grounds of the Gandhi Maidan.

The socialist ideologue Kishan Patnaik said that it was really an irony that products of the movement of 1974 led by Loknayak Jayaprakash Narayan, especially youths of the time, were holding key positions in the government at the Centre and the states today, but the majority of them had become power centric and corrupt.

He said that it was under their regime that the country was fast moving towards socio-economic disaster.

He called upon the peasants, youths, women and all well-meaning people to come out in the open to give a radical direction to politics by cleansing the present-day politics, which has become totally anti-people and anti-poor.

Kishan Patnaik said that there was no short cut, and every well-meaning person will have to take pains for cleansing the politics. To be able to do so, they will have to show active interest in politics.

Patnaik lambasted the present Rashtriya Janata Dal regime run by Laloo Prasad Yadav and Rabri Devi for its abject failure in providing basic facilities like schools, proper roads and healthcare facilities to even poor people from the backward and Dalit sections of the society.

Socialist Front leader Surendra Mohan, SJP national general secretary Sunil (Madhya Pradesh), SJP national president Binodanand Singh, former MLA Sheo Pujan Singh Bharti (UP), student leader Navendu, Patna Zila Parishad member Usha Singh and Azim Ansari were prominent among those who addressed the rally on the occasion.

7,Many hurt as police lathicharge protesters,"PATNA: About a dozen persons, including women, were injured when the police resorted to lathicharge in order to remove a road blockade in the Rukunpura area on Bailey Road under the Danapur police station on Tuesday morning.

Earlier, a group of residents of the locality blocked the road demanding a probe into the mysterious death of a youth, Om Prakash Paswan, in the area whose body was recovered from a well recently.

According to residents, Om Prakash was beaten to death by the police on October 27. On the same day, the police had chased and caned a group of persons allegedly involved in collecting donations in the name of decoration for the Chhath festival in the area, residents said.

""Om Prakash was an electrician. He was engaged in electrification work on the road at Rukunpura. During the stampede after the police operation, he tried to escape from the spot but the police caught him and beat him up black and blue. Then they threw his body into a well,"" residents claimed.

However, the police sources said Om Prakash himself fell into the well while escaping from the spot.

On Tuesday, the local residents demanded a thorough probe into the circumstances which led to his death. ""Why the administration avoided to take the body in its possession for postmortem. He was cremated without postmortem,"" said Ram Jatan Paswan of the locality.

According to Om Prakash''s mother, his son was lone earning member of her family. She told TNN that the police beat her up too on Tuesday morning while removing her from the site of road blockade.

Anita Devi, another women in the locality, said the administration provided Om Prakash''s family a cash of Rs 2000 only after the incident. ""Though the SDP had promised them to give Rs 8,000 more after the cremation of the body, the money is yet to reach the deceased''s family,"" she said.

The residents also demanded a job to one member of Om Prakash''s family. However, despite attempt, Danapur SDPO Hasnain could not be contacted.

9,Bihar govt bid to curb dowry menace,"PATNA: In order to curb the dowry menace, the state government has made it mandatory for male government employees getting married to give a written declaration that they have not taken dowry.

The declaration is to be approved and signed by the spouse, father and father-in-law of such an employee.

A decision to this effect was taken at a cabinet meeting here on Tuesday.

The cabinet approved the Bihar State Prohibition of Dowry Rules, 2003, tightening the noose against dowry.

According to the new rules, district welfare officers have been designated as district dowry prohibition officers and given sweeping powers to investigate dowry-related cases in their respective districts.

They can hold inquiry into dowry-related cases, visit the place of occurrence and record evidence in such cases and seek the help of the police.

They, however, have not been given the power to arrest accused persons.

Apart from making it mandatory for government employees to give a written declaration, it has been made compulsory for a bridegroomâ€™s father to submit a list of gifts presented during the marriage to the district dowry prohibition officer concerned.

The list of gifts is to be submitted within one month of the marriage. The new rule is compulsory for everyone.

The government maintained that the rules have to be enforced strictly to deter people from taking dowry.

It expressed its concern over increase in the number of cases of dowry-related death and torture.

Critics, however, said if the rules are not enforced strictly, they would meet the same fate as the Sharda Act which prohibits child marriage.

11,J&K govt against removal of BSF from valley,"JAMMU: The Border Security Force may not be withdrawn from the Kashmir Valley in the near future if the state government has its say.

Deputy Chief Minister Mangat Ram Sharma said his government would urge Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani to review the Centreâ€™s decision for withdrawal of the BSF from the valley as it would cause problems in fighting militancy.

Sharma commended the BSF for its role in eliminating several top militants in Jammu and Kashmir and said the state needed continuous BSF presence at this ""crucial juncture.""

The state government may make a formal representation to the Union Home Ministry urging it to keep the BSF for some more time in the valley. The familiarity of the force with the topography of the valley and its experience in dealing with the militancy-related situation in the state were considered its assets.

The Centre had recently announced its decision to withdraw the force from the anti-militancy operations in the valley and deploy them on the borders.

12,Harassed HIV victims to sue govt,"PUNE: Condemning the ill-treatment and public humiliation meted out by the Sahar International Airport authorities to six Indian HIV positive passengers on November 1, non-government organisations from all across the country have unanimously decided to file a petition in the Mumbai High Court on Thursday.

Udaan Plus Trust vice president Vijay Nair, who is one among the six persons under quarantine at the Yellow Fever Hospital, told TNN on Wednesday that the petition would be filed immediately after their release on November 6.

""We have asked the Lawyer''s Collective to draft the petitions which will be filed against the Union health ministry, civil aviation ministry, Maharashtra State Aids Control Society and the Mumbai District Aids Control Society for their lackadaisical coordination which put us at the receiving end for no fault of ours,"" Nair said.

The six passengers were returning from the 11th International People Living With HIV/Aids conference in Uganda. They were humiliated in public and eventually kept under quarantine at the YFH in Mumbai by the SIA authorities for not possessing yellow fever vaccination certificates.

Pune-based Ruby Hall Clinic project AIDS director Dr Sanjay Pujari told TNN that it was wrong on the part of the airport authorities to seek to know the HIV positive status of the passengers.

""I see no reason why the six HIV positive persons are under quarantine for yellow fever. If CD-4 count of these HIV positive patients goes below 200 then the live yellow fever vaccine could lead to some other health complications,"" Pujari said, adding the SIA authorities have violated rules laid down by National Aids Control Organisation.

The six detainees are from the following NGOâ€™s â€” Pathway from Pune, Udaan Plus Trust from Mumbai, Care Foundation Manipur, Trivandrum district HIV/Aids Network Organisation, Global Network of sex-workers living with HIV/Aids from Kolkata and an individual HIV/Aids awareness volunteer from Mumbai.

Pune based social-worker Celina D''costa told TNN that they had referred the matter to the International Human Rights Commission and the National Human Rights Commission in Delhi.

""We have asked the state health department to provide us with previous records of HIV+ve patients who were quarantined for yellow fever,"" Dâ€™costa said.

Nair said that they had made the following demands in the petition to the union and state government:

 Initiate judicial inquiry over the humiliation incident

 Suspension of the concerned SIA authorities

 Declare a social audit for the public to know the HIV/Aids work carried by the health ministry

 Maintain complete transparency with respect to HIV/Aids funds received from World Bank and Global funds and draft clear guidelines for PLWHAs and quarantine procedures in the next 30 days.

Medical certificates issued by the respective state governments had clearly stated the HIV positive status of the six individuals and said vaccination of yellow fever may be waived off as some of them have low immunity.

""It is dangerous for us to take the vaccination as our immunity is low, it can lower our CD-4 count. However, the officers refused to listen,"" Nair alleged.

13,Jitu Amaliar arrested in kidnapping case,"AHMEDABAD: The Detection of Crime Branch on Tuesday arrested Jitu Amaliar, son of a police inspector, in the case pertaining to kidnapping of a minor girl, Kirti Soni, on September 14.

Amaliar is the second person after Jitu Patel to be arrested in this case which was filed with the Maninagar police station by parents of the girl.

But they allegedly got little response from the police and had to file a habeas corpus petition in the Gujarat High Court. They stated that investigations might have been delayed as one of the accused is the son of the then PI of Gomtipur police station VK Amaliar.

The court had directed the Maninagar police to produce the girl on October 10. When it failed to do so, investigations were handed over to the DCB which traced the girl after grilling family members of Soni in a house at Varai village in Santhalpur taluka of Patan district.

Amaliar was declared as absconding. On October 17, Amaliar was produced in the High Court which directed that he be produced before the metropolitan magistrate and his bail application could be moved in the sessions court.

However, his advocate sought some clarifications and his arrest was stayed till November 4. Additional public prosecutor Nagesh Sood, appearing for the investigating agency, appealed to the court that Amaliar, an accomplish of accused Jitu Patel, was required for questioning in the case.

As the stay order ended on Tuesday, the DCB arrested Amaliar after getting the courtâ€™s permission.
