0,Village salutes Sarabha with slim govt presence,"SARABHA (LUDHIANA): On the 87th death anniversary of Kartar Singh Sarabha, his village saluted the brave man by kickstarting the Annual Rural Athletics Meet and a mela. Over 500 athletes participated in the event cheered by thousands of villagers from the area who thronged the stadium.

But, even this show was put together by the Non-resident Indians (NRIs) of the village, who still hold his spirit high. The government has sadly done nothing for the village or the family of this Gaddarite.

Kartar Singh Sarabha, after his escape from the sinking Kamagata Maru ship swam back to Indian shores to lead the Gaddar movement to great heights. He was hanged to death in his own village on 16th November, 1915, after his plan of killing British leaders to seek Indiaâ€™s freedom was leaked.

Inderjeet Singh Sarabha, organiser of the games said the NRIs have been putting in money and efforts each year to make this five-day mega event a success.

Lal Singh, the state finance minister and PPCC chief Hanspal presided over the function this year.

In an interview with The Times of India, the finance minister said he was not aware of the pathetic state of Kartar Singhâ€™s sister or that the development work initiated by the Akalis had been stopped under the Congress regime.

Assuring that he would look into the matter, he said the Sarabha museum and memorial would also be completed. He also guaranteed that the government would take care of the medical treatment Sarabhaâ€™s sister.

The sister of Kartar Singh, Jagdish Kaur, who is above 90 years and suffering from cancer, was present in the stadium throughout the games.

Asked about the development and the promises made by the finance minister, Lal Singh, she said that while the villagers and the NRIs pooled money for the great day each year, the ministers did little besides coming here on the occasion and delivering the customary speech. And they were never seen before after.

She criticised the Congress government for disconnecting her phone, withdrawing her medical treatment and stopping funds for development. Skeptical of the promises made by ministers each year, she said she would only believe them when she sees the work restarted.

She pointed pout how she had heard umpteen promises from the past five regimes in the state government. For hundreds who bowed before Sarabhaâ€™s statue outside the stadium, paying their obeisance, his sacrifice looked far more real than to the country, for which he laid down his life.

1,Oppn prepares for fresh offensive against govt,"LUCKNOW: The political battle-lines have been drawn in UP yet again with the ""united"" opposition preparing to mount a fresh offensive against the ruling alliance on November 18, when the state legislative assembly meets to elect a member for the Upper House.

There are reasons why the ruling alliance''s discomfiture looks even more poignant this time. First, the Congress has made it clear for the first time that all its party MLAs would back the opposition nominee, Yashwant Singh. Second, almost all the BJP rebels continue to stick to their guns regardless of the official party moves that have been set in motion against them under the anti-defection law.

And third, nobody knows for sure the precise numerical strength of the rebels. The bosses of the state BJP are still groping in the dark. Maybe, that is why the BJP has more or less decided to underweigh the ""political significance"" of this election. Heavens, and even more importantly the government, wouldn''t fall if the ruling alliance''s nominee, Munna Singh, loses. Their logic is that it''s just an electionâ€” and not a proper trial of strength.

Interestingly, this logic serves the interests of the rebels as well. For, no action can be initiated against them under the anti-defection law, this being an election in which they will be casting their votes through the secret ballot. ""We are, in fact, grateful to the party bosses for their refusal to recognise the importance of this election"", one of the rebels said.

The BJP is not very happy with the candidature of Munna Singh for another reason also. The latter belongs to Ajit Singh''s Rashtriya Lok Dal. Neither Ajit Singh nor his candidate ever approached BJP leaders for support formally. Moreover, Vinay Katiyar''s party has been having subtle policy differences with the RLD over two issuesâ€” creation of Harit Pradesh and cane prices.

In contrast, Yashwant Singh has been doing his homework rather well. After defecting from the BSP, he joined Ram Vilas Paswan''s Lok Janshakti Party. And of late, he has been working as a bridge between BJP rebels and Amar Singh and company. He thinks his victory can be taken for granted under the circumstances.

But with Mayawati around physically and forcefully, one shouldn''t be surprised if things change dramatically in the next twenty-four hours. In her assessment, the ruling alliance just can''t afford to take a relaxed view of things. With Munna Singh''s defeat, the governor would certainly come under heavier moral pressure to summon the House.

2,BJYM to hold rally against misuse of Bihar Niwas,"PATNA: The war of words between the RJD and BJP over the use of Bihar Niwas by family members of chief minister Rabri Devi and RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav continues.

State BJP leaders have ridiculed claims made by senior ruling party leader Ram Kripal Yadav that the children of the chief minister were entitled to enjoy all the facilities of the Bihar Niwas - car, accommodation and telephone facilities - under the Bihar Special Security Force Act, 2000.

The state vice president of the BJP, Kiran Ghai, described the defence put up by RJD as pathetic and stressed that the misuse of funds cannot be allowed even if the persons concerned were relatives of the CM. She alleged that family members of Laloo and Rabri had made it a habit to become extra constitutional authorities.

She alleged that the RJD leaders were trying to mislead the people on the basis of an Act, adding the Act provides for only security and not for a permanent accommodation in Delhi. She stressed that RJD leaders have given a reflection of their mental level by issuing such a defence. Such statements were issued by party MLC Giriraj Singh.

In a joint statement issued by several leaders of the BJYM, they stressed that the charges levelled by opposition leader Sushil Kumar Modi about the illegal occupation of Bihar Niwas, Delhi by the CM''s kin was valid. â€œThe Act mentioned by the RJD leaders to justify the misdeeds, only provides for security to the CM and her children. It does not provide for availing of all the facilities provided to the chief ministerâ€�, they stressed.

The BJYM leaders stressed that the illegal occupation of the Bihar Niwas by the CM''s kin was both unconstitutional and undemocratic and huge funds of the people of the state was being misused in their maintenance. They stressed that the Bihar CM will not be allowed to misuse public funds and that if the Bihar Niwas was not freed from illegal occupation, Morcha men would stage a protest in front of the Niwas.

They also took strong exception to the manner in which the RJD leaders indulged in mudslinging against Modi and challenged them to prove a single charge of irregularity against the Modi.

The signatories to the statement include Anil Sharma, Mangal Pandey, Ashok Yadav and Ajay Yadav. Modi is likely to address a press meet on Sunday to release further evidence against the illegal occupation of Bihar Niwas.

3,HC modifies stay on PCS 2002 exams,"LUCKNOW: The Allahabad High Court on Saturday lifted / modified its earlier order staying further proceedings of PCS-2002 examination and final examination result of PCS-2001.

The court said that appointment of selected candidates of PCS 2001 and 2002 shall be subject to its final decision.

The petitioners, who were unsuccessful in PCS 2002 and 2001 have challenged these examinations on the ground that the scaling system is wrong and illegal, in view of an earlier judgement by this Court in the case of SC Dixit in PCS (J) examination.

Earlier the bench of Justice M Katju and Justice Rakesh Tiwari had stayed the main examination selection process of PCS 2002 and 2001 examinations and had asked the PSC to file counter-affidavit.

4,Another IET student commits suicide,"LUCKNOW: In an incident which raises question on our present system of education, 19-year-old Poonam doing BTech semester I (mechanical) here at the Institute of Engineering and Technology (IET), committed suicide on Saturday allegedly for her lack of proficiency in English.

Although police were yet to reach any conclusion, but preliminary investigations revealed that the girl was suffering from acute depression after she could not perform well in the class tests. Police have also not ruled out other reasons for the extreme step taken by Poonam.

This was the second case of suicide committed by an IET student to rock the campus in the last two months. Earlier, on September 12 BTech I student Anoop Kumar committed suicide at his residence in Kanpur after he suffered depression following being subjected to brutal ragging by some seniors.

Though no suicide note was found, at many places in her notebook Poonam has scribbled ""I donâ€™t want to live"". In an incomplete letter written haphazardly in English language to one Swati, she has mentioned that she used to sleep only for an average of four hours daily. ""I had 106 degree fever for a few days which saved me from ragging... Seniors kept giving many tablets, which spoiled my stomach...I went for shopping with juniors...God God God.""

Poonamâ€™s father, Ram Lakhan Singh, is a block development officer in Najirabad, Bijnore. She had two brothers and one sister. Elder brother was an engineering graduate and elder sister was post graduate in business administration. With 77 per cent marks in the UP Board intermediate examination, she had secured 697th position in the UPSEAT examination.

But after joining IET she was suffering from depression as she could not relate well with the English-medium of instructions and books. Poonamâ€™s roommate Anubha Singh said that Poonam used to complaint to her a lot about her inadequacy in English language. Yashika and Anshul said that she used to do combine studies with her so that ""we could explain the English terms to her"".

On Saturday morning she took her class test and thereafter she took the keys of the hostel room from Anshul saying that she had to take some books. Later, Yashika, who had gone to Aminabad, on her return found the door unlocked and when she pushed it open, to her horror, she found Poonam hanging from the ceiling fan. The news spread like wildfire and panic-stricken students thronged the place.

Teachers said that many students with Hindi-medium background found difficulty in studies in the beginning but, gradually, they picked up with the assistance of other students and teachers. ""However, Poonam seemed to have taken it too hard,"" said dean, academic, Prof Bharti Dwivedi.

5,CLB rules in favour of EIH in Wildflower case,"NEW DELHI: The Company Law Board (CLB) on Friday ruled in favour of EIH, part of the Oberoi group, in the Wildflower Hall Hotel case.

EIH Ltd and the Himachal Pradesh government have been locked in a bitter dispute over the ownership of the prime property in Shimla. The case moved to the CLB early this year when the Himachal Pradesh government terminated the joint venture agreement with EIH and occupied the hotel.

According to EIH, the CLB ruling has upheld its stand in respect of ownership of operations and management of the property. Citing acts of oppression by the Himachal Pradesh government against EIH, the ruling also re-instated the earlier board of the joint venture.

However, Himachal Pradesh state government can appeal against the CLB ruling at the High Court.

To develop the Wildflower Hall property into a five-star deluxe hotel, the Himachal Pradesh government entered into a JV with EIH Ltd in 1995. EIH owns 79 per cent in Mashobra Resort â€” which owns Wildflower Hall â€” with the remaining stake being held by the Himachal Pradesh government.

In March 2002, the state government informed EIH that the JV agreement stood automatically terminated with effect from October 13, 2001. The BJP-Himachal Vikas Congress government had said that the JV deal â€” signed in 1995 â€” had undervalued the cost of the property.

The Himachal Pradesh government had sought that the equity equation between the two partners be restored to 35:65 or some assured annual revenue. It had also been seeking property revaluation.

7,"VMC bans banners, flags on its property for elections","VADODARA: This year â€˜bannerâ€™ campaigning would be a tough job for political parties. After cracking down on the BJP, for damaging public property during the recent Gaurav Yatra, Vadodara Municipal Corporation now plans to ensure that no political party defaces its property.

This year, elections might not be synonymous with defaced walls splattered with vote forâ€™ signs or party symbols.

VMC commissioner Arvind Aggarwal, has issued instructions to all ward officers asking them to ensure that no banners, flags or other materials are strung across VMC property in their respective wards.

â€œThis would include, roads, electricity poles,VMC buildings or any other structure that belongs to the VMC,â€� Aggarwal told TNN. However, various political parties have already ordered large consignments of flags and banners for display on roads.

â€œIn the past we have used banners for displaying our party symbol and candidate. But all this would be as per the norms set by the Election Commission. We will use public property and later pay the VMC for its use,â€� said city BJP unit media cell in-charge, Vanraj Shah.

Aggarwal had taken objection to the BJP damaging roads and dividers to put up banners and flags during the Gaurav Yatra. â€œWe have already started cleaning up places where these flags and banners have come up,â€� he said.

Citizens here have also expressed their displeasure over the way the Sanskarnagri gets defaced every time elections or political programmes are held. They say that the VMC should charge a hefty fine if norms are not followed.

Yatish Baxi a resident of the old city area said, â€œPolitical parties should understand that public property or even private property cannot be defaced for â€˜pracharâ€™ (publicity). If they want to campaign, they can go door-to-door, give out pamphlets and handouts to informthe public about the candidates that they represent.â€� As per Election Commission guidelines, defacement of property is not allowed.

No political party, or candidate or supporters can use private property without the permission of the owner of the property. However, this norm does not seem to deter political parties. Most major political parties have planned to use cloth banners, to be put up across city roads.

â€œWe shall use the banners and display them as per the EC norms,â€� said city Congress general secretary Bhogilal Patel.

8,Godhra rally loses steam after Togadia’s arrest,"GODHRA: With their leaders arrested in Ahmedabad, the VHP lost steam here on Sunday afternoon with the attempt to take out a rally ending in a whimper.

A group of VHP activists, including eight sadhus, who brought out a rally, were stopped before they could reach the proposed â€˜dhramasabhaâ€™ ground.

According to special IGP (Vadodara range) Deepak Swaroop, 49 people, including Bajrang Dal president Harish Bhatt and VHP''s Godhra unit secretary Rakesh Thakore, were arrested.

The Science and Arts College ground, the proposed â€˜dhramasabha sthalâ€™, had turned into a virtual fortress since Saturday after VHP international general secretary Pravin Togadia decided to defy the EC ban and go ahead with his plan to hold the â€˜dharmasabhaâ€™ and yatra from here.

The excitement here subsided soon after the news of Togadia''s arrest reached here. However, at around 3 pm a group of people, including Godhra MP Bhupendrasinh Solanki and Bhatt, came out of a house in Green Park Society here and began walking with banners towards the college ground. A large group of policemen, who were waiting nearby, followed them and the group was stopped at Bhoiwada on Ankleswar-Mahadev Road.

While they carried banners with â€˜Jai Sri Ramâ€™ written on them, the activists shouted slogans and were joined by people coming out of alleys and bylanes. When stopped by the police, the activists squatted on the road as Harish Bhatt made an impromptu speech, slamming JM Lyngdoh.

The police then put them in a bus and took them to the SRP headquarters. Another group of people were picked up from Pathar Talavdi.

9,Urban voters largely apathetic to elections,"AHMEDABAD: Will voters in the cities of Gujarat come out and cast their ballot in large numbers on December 12? Past elections do not inspire any confidence. For all their education and strong political views, city-slickers have never had a reputation of voting in large numbers.

They will engage themselves in heated political debates but they will not engage themselves in the process of electing a government.

By contrast, rural folk have voted in large numbers and played an important role in who will come to power in the state. Over the years, less than 50 per cent of the electorate in cities have voted, while the number in rural areas is anywhere between 60 and 75 per cent, showing they are more eager to have a say in who goes to Gandhinagar.

â€œBlame it on apathy and laziness,â€� says Congress MP Madhusudan Mistry while commenting on urban voters. He has spent years working in rural Gujarat before entering politics. â€œIt is a deadly mixture of being disillusioned with politicians and not wanting to make the effort of standing in a line to vote. Villagers often show their anger for not having basic amenities by voting. After all, they are not in a position to bribe to get things done like city-dwellers might do.â€�

As figures of the Election Commission show, less than 50 per cent electorate from the posh Ellisbridge constituency of Ahmedabad voted in the last assembly elections in 1998. In stark contrast, nearly 70 per cent of the eligible voters from Viramgam in rural Ahmedabad voted.

The story was repeated in Vadodara where just about 50 voters queued up at booths in Sayajiganj, but more than 70 per cent voters turned up at Padra just outside the city. â€œOnly 38 per cent of the electorate cast its vote in the recent elections in as urbanised a country as the US,â€� says Binoy Acharya of Unnati, a co-ordinating agency for NGOs, most of which work in the rural sector. â€œThis shows that the urban-rural divide is a global phenomenon. City people seem to believe politicians donâ€™t make a difference to their lives when they actually do. They donâ€™t have a sense of involvement in the political process.â€�

Acharya believes the same lack of involvement is found in rural areas as well, but community and caste leaders hold sway there and can ensure that more people vote. â€œIndian voters have always sprung a surprise. You never know how they will vote and how many will vote.â€�

BJP MLA Amit Shah has both rural and urban areas in his constituency Sarkhej. â€œThe work that you do in a rural area always remain in focus,â€� he says. â€œPersonal obligations hold more sway, the effect of which may be diffused in an urban centre. People in the villages have real livelihood issues and see elections as a way of making a difference.

Besides, the impact of local body elections lingers on longer resulting in higher voting percentages.â€� Shah, however, adds that he would not be surprised if more people vote in the cities as well in this election. â€œMore people will come out and vote on security. Just as development is an important issue in the villages and towns, security now has become an important issue in the cities in the face of the recent terrorist attack.â€�

Percentage of votes in 1998 elections

AHMEDABAD: Ellisbridge: 48.82, Viramgam: 68.72 VADODARA: Sayajiganj: 50.73 Padra: 72.12 RAJKOT: Rajkot II: 46.98 Wankaner: 68.64 SURAT: Surat (west): 43.341 Kamrej: 67.54

10,Babus shed political baggage,"GANDHINAGAR: The change in the outlook of the Gujarat administration is stark. Accused of being under the BJPâ€™s spell ever since the riots broke out in February, itâ€™s now clearly asserting itself, having come directly under the purview of the Election Commission.

The bureaucrats manning crucial departments such as home, industry, finance, revenue, food and civil supplies have been quick in telling their bosses, without bothering about the consequences, that they wonâ€™t clear files that have political strings attached.

Call it the Lyngdoh effect with a no-nonsense chief election commissioner keeping an eye on anyone found siding with politicians. The emboldened bureaucrats have no hesitation telling their political bosses that the BJPâ€™s agenda is no longer theirâ€™s. If earlier additional chief secretary (home) Ashok Narayan was heard saying he was obliged to follow instructions from Chief Minister Narendra Modi, today his colleagues find him a â€œchanged manâ€�.

He doesnâ€™t mince words when he says, â€œI donâ€™t care who comes to power.â€� A likely candidate for the chief secretaryâ€™s post in the near future, Narayan and his department conveyed to the police that the VHP yatra was not a religious affair but a political event and that one should not take instructions from the CM as he was one of the parties in the polls. It was made clear that the home department, not functioning under the EC, was obliged to act independently.

Sources said when the EC asked for a report on the VHP yatra, a clarification was sought whether it has to be that of the â€œstate governmentâ€� or of the â€œpermanent executiveâ€�, i.e. the bureaucracy.

The EC sought the â€œpermanent executiveâ€™s reportâ€� and the home department acted fast. Without showing the report to the CM, even at the risk of inviting his ire, the report clearly said that â€œcommunal passions and tensionâ€� would be aroused as a result of the yatra, and â€œserious law and order problems might be createdâ€�.

VHP leader Pravin Togadia and Acharya Dharmendra were trying to tell mediapersons that the EC did not base its decision to ban the yatra on the governmentâ€™s report.

But the BJP leadership knew that the ECâ€™s decision was based on the governmentâ€™s report on which the caretaker CM wasnâ€™t even consulted.

Bureaucrats are of the view that Modi has had his way so far, but no further. Some are toeing the independent line out of sheer conviction, while others are scared theyâ€™ll incur the ECâ€™s wrath if they are seen to hobnobbing with politicians.

11,Mysura ticks off govt on funds,"HYDERABAD: Congress legislator M V Mysura Reddy on Sunday took the government for task for ""failing to secure adequate funds for taking up drought relief works in the state.""

""The government has totally failed in securing adequate funds and to cover up its inefficiency it is blaming the Congress,"" he said.

Speaking to reporters, Mysura Reddy said that the Centre did not release adequate funds to the state as it already had funds to the tune of Rs 160 crore as well as seven lakh metric tonnes of rice which has not been spent from August. ""The delays in taking a decision as to who should be the sanctioning authority has resulted in this situation,"" he said.

The central task force also took a serious note of the irregularities in the Food-for-Work programme and the Food Corporation of India (FCI) had conducted a discreet inquiry which showed that 10 lakh tonnes of rice was recycled, he alleged.

Mysura Reddy lashed out at the ruling party for claiming that taken aback by the Congressâ€™ blackmail, the Centre has released inadequate funds to the state. ""We are not in the government. It is only due to the inefficiency of the chief minister, the key supporter of the NDA coalition, that the Centre did not provide funds as demanded by the state,"" he said.

Accordingly other awards have been increased.

13,Ex-minister’s Safari involved in accident,"LUCKNOW: The personal Tata Safari saloon of former minister for environment and non-conventional energy Bachcha Pathak rammed into a luxury car in Gosainganj, throwing the two occupants out of the vehicle on Sunday. In a bid to escape, the driver sped dragging the car of the victims to over five kilometres before the Safari landed up with a flat tyre.

The local villagers, who chased the accused, managed to overpower the occupants of the Safari who were handed over to the Gosainganj police. The incident took place when the former ministerâ€™s vehicle was on its way to the state capital around noon. As it reached Sohra Mau tri-section, the vehicle rammed into a Bauxer City (UP 32 AP 0201).

Two occupants of the Bauxer, Ram Awadh (35) and Shiv Kumar (30) of Sohra Mau, were thrown out of the vehicle due to the impact. As the locals began to collect at the site, the driver of the Safari, which did not have a registration plate, sped away. It was near Kajariya Farms that the Safari developed a flat tyre and the vehicle, occupied by Pathak himself, was forced to halt.

Thereafter, police reached the site and the accused driver of the Safari, identified as Dewendra Kumar Tewari, was handed over to the police. The injured, both brothers, were admitted to hospital with severe injuries. The Gosainganj police later registered a case in connection with the incident and formally arrested the driver.

14,New turn to IET suicide,"LUCKNOW: The mystery behind the reasons which forced a girl student of Institute of Engineering and Technology (IET) to commit suicide deepened on Sunday with the father of the deceased claiming that his daughter was forced to take the extreme step due to ragging.

However, students and teachers as well as technical education minister Amita Singh, who visited the campus, maintained that the girl was suffering from acute academic depression due to inferiority complex of being a Hindi medium student. Poonam, a BTech I student, was found dead hanging in a hostel room on Saturday afternoon. The minister met the girls and ordered a high-level inquiry into the incident and asked the students to write and submit their views, problems and family background to the hostel warden.

Poonamâ€™s father RL Singh, who came to collect the body, appeared in a furious mood. He told reporters that Poonam, when she visited her native place in Bijnore during Diwali holidays, had confided that ragging was taking place in the hostels and college. College authorities, however, rejected the argument saying if she had complained to her parents about ragging, why didnâ€™t they report the matter to the authorities.

They said that investigations had revealed that the girl was suffering from depression and was under family pressure to perform well in academics. The hostel authorities formed an inquiry committee, which recorded statements of the girls living in the hostel. Most of the girls recalled various incidents where Poonam showed symptoms of depression as she was not well-versed in English and was cynical about her future. They also admitted that ragging was taking place, but it was not severe. Another twist to the mystery came when one of the friends, Yashika Gupta, who had first spotted the body and in whose room the suicide took place, claimed that the letter which police said on Saturday was of Poonam, actually belonged to her.

She said that Poonam was very weak in English language and used to take Yashikaâ€™s help in this regard. Girls said that Poonam was a topper student throughout her studies, but was not performing well at the IET.
