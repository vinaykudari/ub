0,Govt sets new rules for doc appointment,"KOLKATA: The state government on Thursday announced a new set of rules for the appointment of medical officers in state health services selected through the public service commission.

A health department release issued during the day says posting of medical officers for general duty will be done as per the merit list prepared by the PSC. The state government will recruit 1,463 doctors in the state health services of which 460 are reserved for SCs and 195 for STs.

PSC secretary S.N. Nandi said 21 SC candidates, three ST candidates and 11 from the backward community have ranked among the list of 680 candidates by â€œvirtue of their performancesâ€�.

Names of these candidates are being recommended against 36 general vacancies. The state government has decided to give medical officers a posting in their home districts based on the availability of vacancies. Candidates selected from Kolkata will be posted in various districts in compliance with the merit list. In case both husband and wife are selected, they are likely to be posted in the same district and in the same station.

2,Congress may put off its rally at Shivaji Park,"MUMBAI: The Congress leadership is reconsidering its decision to hold Sonia Gandhiâ€™s rally at Shivaji Park here on December 27.

The decision to hold the rally was taken before the assembly elections in Rajasthan and others states. It was expected that the party would perform well in the polls and the rally was meant to be a victory celebration. But with the party receiving a thrashing in the polls, there is nothing to celebrate.

President of the Mumbai Regional Congress Committee (MRCC) Gurudas Kamat told TNN on Wednesday that there is no change in the programme as of now. â€œBut a section of the party feels that it would be appropriate if a rally is held at Shivaji Park during the Lok Sabha elections.

There are strong indications that these polls would be held in March-April, 2004 and hence it would make more sense to hold the rally then so that the party can derive maximum mileage from it,â€™â€™ he added. What is really worrying the All-India Congress Committee (AICC) is the intense infighting in the city unit of the Congress.

â€œThe anti-Kamat group is still sulking since its demand for the removal of Mr Kamat has not been conceded by the party high command. The rally cannot be a success without the support of all the factions.

It is better to postpone the rally rather than hold one with a poor turnout,â€™â€™ a senior Congress leader said. In the past, the MRCC used to get mill workers to attend its rallies at Shivaji Park in thousands.

However, with most mills shut down, there are relatively few mill workers around. The party is now banking on its corporators to mobilise slum-dwellers.

3,Meat prices likely to increase,"HYDERABAD: Prices of meat are likely to go up with five slaughterhouses moving to the Chengicherla abattoir near the Cherlapalli central jail â€” about 30 km from the city â€” on Dec. 31.

However, this may not be entirely unwelcome news for residents living in the neighbourhood of the five slaughterhouses for they have been silently suffering the stink for years.

Some 4,000 cattle and sheep are slaughtered daily at these five slaughterhouses at Jiaguda, Ramanthapur, Gowlipura, Amberpet and New Bhoiguda.

They produce 20 tonnes of waste per day, enveloping the entire area in a foul smell and contaminating the ground water. These areas are also breeding grounds for mosquitoes and flies.

Though meat traders are protesting the decision to shift the slaughterhouses out of the city, officials said the modern abattoir at Chengicherla will supply hygienic meat to city residents.

The 83 acre Chengicherla abattoir, a Rs 32 crore project, is in the final stages of completion. It will have modern facilities such as sheds for the cattle in a 15 acre parcel of land and staff quarters.More than 5000 animals, both big and small, can be slaughtered there in a day, officials said.

The closing down of the existing slaughterhouses in the city comes in the wake of the High Courtâ€™s order that the Chengicherla abattoir be commissioned by Jan. 1, 2004.

The court said it would not entertain any request to allow the five slaughterhouses to continue functioning until the abattoir is completed.

The court also directed the police commissioner to ensure that all the slaughterhouses in the city are shut from Dec. 31, an official said. Beefing up prices

5,Countdown starts for 'surplus' ministers,"LUCKNOW: With Rajya Sabha giving its assent to the Anti-defection Bill, many a head, wearing the ministerial crowns in UP would have lay uneasy on Thursday.

Going by the provision of limiting the ministries to 15 per cent of the strength of the house, the countdown has already begun for the ''37 weakest links'' out of an army of 97-membered mega ministry in the state who may find themselves out in the cold after a stipulated six-month deadline.

Speculations about the prospective losers in the game of musical chair have started doing the rounds here much before the actual exercise to trim and prune the excess growth actually begins.

â€œChief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav has convened a meeting on December 22 and the issue is likely to be taken up there,â€� informed minister for parliamentary affairs Mohammad Azam Khan on Thursday. â€œSo far not much thought has been spared over this,â€� he admitted, adding that Rajya Sabha nod has changed the complexion. â€œAny decision over this,â€� said Khan, â€œwill be taken after discussing it threadbare with the party organisation, specially its national executive.â€�

The forced good bye to 37 ministers however, may prove to be an awkward affair to the SP supremo more so as the bill effectively nips in the bud any subsequent rehabilitation in the corporations. Yet, Yadav may emerge stronger than before and to an extent more relaxed, as apart from brooding in private, the disgruntled will not be able to do anything else.

â€œFor the first time, the chief minister shall have the liberty to go by his discretion,â€� a senior cabinet minister remarked. Although SP may have to bear the maximum brunt of the downsizing (party ko atmanushasan me rahna hoga).

One could also look forward to a better set of ministers as merit clean record and region will play a decisive role in the selection, he pointed out. This could mean trouble for some of the controversial BSP and Congress rebels who recently accommodated, he agreed. But knowing the CM''s regard for the commitments already made, the coalition partners, he said, would not be disturbed.

â€œThose likely to be worst affected by the Act will be professional turncoats, including the independents and who found themselves in every ministry,â€� said the CLP leader Pramod Tiwari. All parties could breath easy now, opined the UPCC chief Jagdambika Pal, obviously alluding to rumoured splits in the offing in BSP BJP and a third split in the Congress party.

The CM will definitely take into account all his coalition partners including the Congress party before he takes any decision, remarked RKP chief Kalyan Singh who sees a fresh hope for democracy with the new order. Any change in numbers, he added, would be a consensus decision.

6,'West has Pota-like laws',"NEW DELHI: Can Deputy PM L K Advani sleep peacefully when so many innocent people are in jail under Pota? asked Saifuddin Soz, Congress MP from Jammu and Kashmir during the debate on the Pota amendment Bill on Thursday.

He made an impassioned plea to scrap Pota.

On a day the Bill was passed, Advani accepted that Pota was a draconian law but asserted the need for it saying most western democracies have similar laws.

Advani denied the Opposition''s contention that its misgivings were proven right and that this Bill was brought in before the elections merely to help MDMK leader Vaiko and the BJP''s allies.

He said there is not a single instance of the Centre misusing the law and the amendment is being brought in only to ensure that the law is not being abused.

Opposition members wanted Section 21 of the law to be amended so that the definition of terrorism would not be left to executive discretion.

But the Congress'' double standards were exposed by Advani when he pointed out that even while its members claimed that its state governments were not using the law, the majority of the 440 Pota detenus were in Congress-ruled Maharashtra.

And, despite opposing the amendment, the Congress-led Opposition facilitated the Bill''s passage by walking out of the House. Otherwise, with the AIADMK insisting on a vote, the Congress would have been forced to vote against the Bill which could have jeopardised the amendment''s passage.

But Kapil Sibal (Congress), while moving a resolution opposing the Bill, argued that the review committees that have been strengthened under the amendment would not be useful because during the investigation, the committees cannot intervene and after the investigation, the prosecution would start the judicial process which the committees cannot stop.

V Maithreyan (AIADMK) quoted a Supreme Court order quashing the review committee''s decision against an earlier designated TADA court to point out that the committees are powerless in interfering with the judicial process.

While Bimal Jalan, nominated member and former RBI governor, sought a clear definition of terrorism that would not give scope to discretionary interpretations, another maiden speaker Chandan Mitra sought terrorism to be classified as a federal crime.

Advani picked up this theme and indicated that the government might move in this direction. This could make Pota enforceable only by the Centre.He said there is need today to identify certain crimes as federal crimes.
