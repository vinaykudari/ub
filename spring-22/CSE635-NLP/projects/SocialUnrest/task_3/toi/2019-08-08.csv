0,Journalist arrested on extortion charges gets bail,"PUNE: Judicial magistrate first class (JMFC) Ulka Joshi released journalist Abid Sheikh on a bail of Rs 15,000 on Wednesday. Sheikh was arrested by crime branch sleuths on Tuesday on extortion charges.

It may be recalled that inspector Datta Mane arrested Sheikh on Tuesday while demanding a bribe of Rs 5 lakh from ward officer B. G. Agawane for not publishing alleged irregularities at the PMC''s Yerwada ward office.

Assistant public prosecutor Vishwas Mudgual pressed for Sheikh''s custody, arguing, ""Though no cash was recovered, his custody is necessary for further investigation.""

However, defence counsel Pratap Pardeshi referred to a Bombay high court judgement which had ruled that an offence of extortion was bailable. Accepting his arguments, Joshi released Sheikh on bail.

1,BJP accuses Pandya of violating party discipline,"GANDHINAGAR: A day after Minister of State for Revenue Haren Pandya quit, the BJP in Gujarat on Wednesday accused him of violating party discipline by going public with his reply to the show-cause notice demanding an explanation for his reported criticism of Narendra Modi government''s handling of communal riots in the state.

A resolution passed at a meeting of party''s state unit denied having acted under pressure from Modi or any other quarter in issuing the show cause to Pandya and asserted the action was purely BJP''s decision.

The meeting was attended among others by President Rajendrasinh Rana and treasurer Ramdas Agarwal.

Flaying Pandya for going public on his explanation to Rana, it accused the former minister of violating party discipline by criticising Modi immediately after tendering his resignation and BJP had taken this very seriously.

All that BJP wanted to know from Pandya was whether or not he had made any deposition before Citizen''s Tribunal, as hinted by a news magazine, alleging that the Chief Minister''s had asked the police officials at a meeting immediately after Godhra carnage to go soft with VHP activists during the bandh.

""But Pandya went overboard with the issue and by going to media with his explanation, he broke party discipline,"" the resolution said.

The party had made it clear that he either tender an apology for making public his explanation or face action for having flouted party discipline.

The resolution welcomed the acceptance of Pandya''s resignation and brushed aside as ""rumours"" all talks of differences between Modi and the party.

2,Assembly directs govt to expedite trials concerning women,"MUMBAI: The Maharashtra legislative assembly on Wednesday directed the state government to expedite the trial of cases concerning women and ensure speedy disposal of long-pending cases of harassment of women.

The presiding officer in the lower house of the state legislature, Prasad Tanpure, issued the instructions after allparty MLAs expressed concern on the issue during a debate on a non-official bill initiated by former minister and BJP MLA, Shobha Phadnavis. Supported by statistics compiled by the state authorities, Ms Phadnavis in her over 20-minute speech highlighted the sufferings of the women and the stateâ€™s failure to address their grievances.

The BJP MLA complained about the long period of trial and the near negligible punishment given to offenders and demanded that special provision should be enacted in the law for effectively tackling the case concerning women harassment. â€œThe reported cases of rape from January - December 2000 was 1,308 while the number from January-August 2001 was 892.

There is hardly any decline. Moreover, records reveal that only 7.1 per cent of rape cases have been disposed off in the courts while the bulk of 92.9 per cent of cases are still pending at various levels,â€™â€™ Ms Phadnavis said. The reported cases of dowry deaths from January-December 2000 was 470,while the 307 dowry-related deaths were reported during January-August 2001, the BJP MLA said, adding that 90.4 per cent of the cases are still awaiting justice in the court of law. Ms Phadnavis also pointed out to the scary living conditions in the stateâ€™s prisons for the women inmates.

â€œIn Arthur road jail, the womenâ€™s barrack has a capacity of 23 as against which 133 women under trials are forced to live an huddled existence. Those suffering from AIDS, TB and other contagious diseases have no separate arrangement and are mixed with the other inmates,â€™â€™ she said. â€œWhat is more there is discrimination in the food given to Indian women under trial and the foreign women inmates.

The latter are provided with bread, eggs, more milk, more rice and other essentials. On the other hand the locals have no such privilege because the food manual prepared prior to the pre-Independence era is still in vogue in our jails,â€™â€™ Ms Phadnavis said. Shiv Sena MLA Vishaka Raut also echoed similar sentiments and said that inhuman conditions prevail in the jails where only two buckets of water are provided for 133 women.

3,Govt rules out Kalam proposal to address MPs,"NEW DELHI: An address to members of Parliament meant to emphasise speedy, all-round development of the nation, proposed by President A P J Abdul Kalam for August 13, was called off on Wednesday after the government requested that it wanted to see the draft, sources in government and Parliament said.

Unconventional as it appeared, the Kalam proposal to address the MPs surprised the government. More so, because Kalam is due to address the nation the next day, August 14, on the eve of the Independence Day.

Lok Sabha sources confirmed that Speaker Manohar Joshi had called on the President on Tuesday afternoon. Joshi was understood to have agreed to Kalam''s proposal to organise a meeting with the MPs. Following a communication from the Rashtrapati Bhavan, Joshi also discussed the matter with Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani. However, Joshi, it appears, left the delicate issue to the government.

The official word, however, is that Joshi had met Kalam in connection with an ''orientation course'' for the MPs, which was called off. As for the address to the MPs, the word is that ``it was never planned''''. And as for the proposed August 13 address, even the MPs were unaware of it.

``We have not been informed by our parliamentary party,'''' was the common refrain. Some MPs pointed out that they would need to go to their respective constituencies on August 13 to be in time for the Independence Day functions.

Normally, the President addresses Parliament to open the budget session in February each year, to open a new Parliament after the Lok Sabha polls or when a visiting dignitary is honoured. As per the Constitution, any other address would have to be only on ministerial advice.

At the same time, there is no bar on the head of the state informally interacting with MPs. The late Shankar Dayal Sharma was known to hold group meetings.

Speedy progress to make the country a developed one was one of the main themes of the inaugural address of Kalam after he took oath of the office on July 25. He has been dwelling on his favourite theme for some time while speaking to everyone - from school children to elders.

4,EU asks Hurriyat to join polls,"SRINAGAR: Toeing the American line, a five-member delegation of the European Union, has asked the All-Party Hurriyat Conference to participate in the Jammu and Kashmir assembly polls, scheduled for September/October.An European Union delegation comprising Michel Stenberg from Denmark, Estatos Lozos from Greece, Michel Caillite, Itala Qcchi from Italy and Signi Ropika of Denmark, arrived here on Tuesday and met chief minister Farooq Abdullah and the governor.The delegation was apprised about the arrangements made by the state government for ensuring free and fair polls.The members also met Hurriyat leaders here on Wednesday to tried to persuade them to participate in the assembly election in order to prove the representative character of the conglomerate of 23 separatist outfits.Earlier, American and British diplomats had asked the Hurriyat leaders to join the polls.

5,Congress may boycott J&K polls,"SRINAGAR: The Congress is considering a move to boycott the Jammu and Kashmir assembly election, to be held in September/October. Reason: It is dissatisfied with the security provided to Congress leaders. The party is also upset that the elections are to be conducted without the imposition of Governorâ€™s rule in the state.

Jammu and Kashmir Pradesh Congress Committee vice-president Peerzada Sayeed on Wednesday accused the National Democratic Alliance government at the Centre of ensuring another six-year-term to the Farooq Abdullah regime by holding polls under the National Conferenceâ€™s rule.

By next week, the PCC will decide whether to fight the elections under the present dispensation headed by Farooq Abdullah or not.

The Congress leader said the central party leadership had been informed about the apprehensions of party workers about the fairness of elections.

Peerzada said the ruling National Conference had provided security cover to only 56 Congress workers, while around 4,500 NC workers had been given security. He added that the the security of a Congress candidate from Langate who did not win a seat in the 1996 assembly polls was withdrawn after the election dates were announced last week.

Peerzada also demanded that the polling staff, especially the presiding officers, be brought from outside Jammu and Kashmir to ensure fair polls. At the same time, he clarified that the Congress did not doubt the credibility of bureaucrats here. But they could face problems in case they did not help the NC.

Criticising the statement of inspector-general of police Kashmir range K Rajinder, Peerzada said the officer in question seems to be more committed towards the NC than the citizens.

6,Samajwadi Party calls for state bandh today,"LUCKNOW: The Samajwadi Party has given a call for a state-wide bandh on August 8 to protest the bomb attack on Apna Dal MLA Atiq Ahmad and the imposition of Gangster Act on party worker Arvind Singh Gope. Dharnas and demonstrations will also be staged at all district headquarters.

Addressing a press conference, state president Ram Sharan Das said the attack on Ahmad should be condemned in the strongest possible terms and could not be taken lightly as it was an attack on democracy. He said there was a conspiracy to eliminate Atiq Ahmad and demanded that he be kept in jail for ensuring the security of his life. The state unit of Apna Dal has also condemned the attack on party legislator Atiq Ahmad in the strongest possible terms. Referring to chief minister Mayawatiâ€™s statement that there was a conspiracy to eliminate her, he said it was in effect the preparation of ground for the elimination of Atiq Ahmad. He demanded that Mayawati be dismissed under section 120 B for being one of the conspirators.

During dharnas the party would also raise the demand for the dismissal of the chief minister, he added. Das alleged the chief minister was conspiring to either put the SP leaders in jail or get them killed. He said the partyâ€™s persistent demand to raise the security-cover for state general secretary Shivpal Singh Yadav had not been acceded to. He added there was a threat to Yadavâ€™s life also and in this connection alleged that some officers of the secretariat were giving shelter of criminals.

On the imposition of Gangsters Act on Arvind Singh Gope, Das said Mayawati was in no position to do so, in view of the fact that her party itself was full of people with criminal records. Meanwhile, SP youth activists created a minor ruckus on the LU campus as news about imposition of Gangsters Act on Gope came in.

7,Bihar govt fights shy of CBI meet,"PATNA: The Bihar government has failed to respond to a letter from the Union home ministry asking it to suggest five points to check economic crimes, specially corruption cases.The letter to all state chief secretaries also asked them to suggest the name of an official each for attending the proposed anti-corruption conference sponsored by the CBI.The Centre sent three reminders, and in the last fax message, it stated that the last date for sending the officer's name as well as for suggesting five points for the agenda was August 3. But the state government did not bother to respond to the Union home ministry's letter, said a senior Bihar official.The state government was supposed to nominate an IG-rank official for the conference. The very agenda of the proposed CBI conference to be held in New Delhi has put the Bihar government in a fix. Officials in the secretariat point to the poor track record of the state in handling economic crimes. A report by the economic offences wing says the files relating to smugglers and fake currency note racketeers have been gathering dust for a long period. An IG-rank officer went to the extent of saying that a former DGP was economic offence-friendly.Even in the handling of corruption cases, the state government's track record is dubious. A senior IAS officer pointed to a recent notification regarding the charges against the high-profile administrative officer of Bihar Nivas in Delhi Karu Ram. Ram was charged with financial irregularities. Yet the notification against him mentions the withholding of his four yearly increments only. The same government has dismissed a BDO from service for producing a fake travel bill though the officer had not drawn the money, the official remarked while charging the state government with adopting a double standard.During the recent assembly session, the issue of irregular withdrawal of over Rs 8 crore was raised. The government conceded that the delay in sanctioning the prosecution of officers had benefited the accused and several of them had retired.During the fodder scam investigation, as many as six IAS officers went to jail. Earlier, several IPS officers of the state had been chargesheeted by the CBI in connection with the uniform scam. The state vigilance bureau is still looking into the corruption cases against 17 IAS and 15 IPS officers. Some of them for quite some time.With such a track record, one could hardly expect from the state government to be interested in the anti-corruption conference, stressed the official.

8,Transporters call Bihar bandh on Friday,"PATNA: Despite the announcement of â€˜suspension of strikeâ€™ made on Tuesday night at the chief ministerâ€™s house by the Bihar Motor Transport Federation president Jagannath Singh and others, the transportersâ€™ strike continued on Wednesday. Asserting that the Tuesday night announcement was made under â€˜pressureâ€™, the federation has called for Bihar bandh on August 9.

In a swift development, the federation on Wednesday elected Uday Shankar Prasad Singh its new working president. â€œThe health of Jagannath Singh does not permit him to bear stress. He has had a heart bypass surgery recently. His doctors have advised him rest,â€� remarked the general secretary of the federation, Sagirul Haque.

Haque stated that a meeting of the federation executive was held on Wednesday and all its members decided to reject the agreement reached under pressure. â€œIf the agitation is to be suspended till August 25, the government should also keep the road tax hike in abeyance till then,â€� remarked Haque. Jagannath Singh, who has been the president of the federation for over two decades, was under tremendous pressure, the federation asserted.

After the Tuesday nightâ€™s announcement, all commercial vehicles were expected to return on the roads from Wednesday. However, this did not happen. Only five buses were parked at the Hardinge Park private bus stand on Wednesday. The vehicles, owned by Jagannath Singh, had no driver or helper. Nor were there any booking agents. â€œThe buses were forcibly brought to the bus stand by the police. The owner did not give his consent,â€� alleged office-bearers of the federation. In sharp contrast, government buses were found overcrowded at the government bus stand.

Water resources minister Jagdanand Singh denied that pressure was applied on the transporters during the meeting on Tuesday night. â€œThese charges have been made by a section of transporters who did not attend the meeting,â€� he asserted. He said that no agreement was reached during the meeting. â€œAll that was decided was that the transporters would suspend their agitation till August 25, the day when the government will hold a high-level meeting to look into the demands of transporters,â€� he said.

Meanwhile, various transport organisations has reiterated their commitment to continue with their agitation. â€œThe government is trying to create a rift between transporters,â€� asserted the Patna Mahanagar Tempo Chalak Sangh.

It called the meeting at the chief ministerâ€™s house an eyewash. The organisations also charged the government with trying to mislead the transporters by making false announcements.

The Bihar Pradesh Mini Truck Association asserted that the strike will continue till the road tax hike was withdrawn.

â€œWe are taken by surprise by the state governmentâ€™s persistent move to tame leaders of transporters and forcing them to make unilateral announcement that has no meaning,â€� Sagirul Haque said.

Any step with respect to the strike will be a collective decision of all leaders and it will not be influenced by anyone, he remarked.

In the state capital here, some government-run buses and auto-rickshaws were seen plying in depleted numbers while other commercial vehicles continued to stay off the roads. Not a single bus plied nor any movement of trucks was noticed.

After a meeting with Rabri Devi and Laloo Yadav, Bihar Rajya Autorickshaw Chalak Sangh general secretary R K Jha and his Minibus Association counterpart U P Sinha had on Monday announced calling off their agitation following assurance that their demands would be looked into sympathetically.

9,Film Chamber asks govt to regularise cable operators,"HYDERABAD: The Andhra Pradesh Film Chamber of Commerce (APFCC) and latest blockbuster Jayamâ€™s director Teja on Wednesday demanded that the government issue an order to regularise and register all cable operators and video shops in the state, as a lasting solution to video and audio piracy.

Video piracy was leading to a loss of over Rs 300 crore to the industry and an equal amount to the government every year in the form of taxes. Teja told reporters that Bangalore-based Ratan Rai was the kingpin behind the piracy in south India.

Other prominent players in this business were Bhaskar Rao based in Vijaywada, Jeeva Ratnam based in Tirupati and also named Papu Electronics at Sultan Bazar and Chiru Videos located at Babu Khan Estates in Hyderabad as prime dealers in pirated VCDs and cassettes.

The director said the names came to light after joint raids conducted in the state, including Dilsuknagar and Kukatpally on the city outskirts, by him and the chamberâ€™s anti-video piracy vigilance cell that was constituted last month.

APFCC president B V Reddy said the chamber had decided for the first time to impose a fine of Rs 10 lakh on Venkateswara Talkies of West Godavari after it was found that the talkies was the place where pirated versions of latest Telugu films were being made.

AP Producersâ€™ Council chairman Dr K L Narayana said the home minister had promised to set up a cell to check piracy.

10,BJP wants probe into pump allotments since '83,"NEW DELHI: BJP MPs on Thursday asked Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, to order a thorough inquiry into the selections made for allocation of petrol pumps and gas agencies by the Dealer Selection Board since 1983 and cancel the dealership of all those related to any sitting or former MP, MLA or party functionary.

Appreciating Vajpayee''s decision to cancel all allotments made since January 2000 as ""bold and courageous"", party''s national secretary Shivraj Singh Chauhan said that during the earlier Congress regime, apart from the judges, one or two members from the public who were social workers or represented SC or ST community, were handpicked by the minister as members of the Dealer Selection Board.

""These members were of the Congress, including at times former MPs or MLAs. One can only imagine what type of fairness will be there in selection made by such a Board, where there was no representative from the oil companies even for name''s sake and the majority of members were Congress functionaries,"" the MPs said in a memorandum submitted to Vajpayee.

Among those who signed the memorandum were party general secretary Anita Arya, Delhi unit president Madan Lal Khurana, Laxminarayan Pandey and Kirit Somaiyya.

11,"Notices to Centre, Delhi govt","NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court on Thursday issued notices to the Centre and the Delhi state government on a public interest litigation seeking action against hospital staffers who are on strike. Replies have to be filed by Friday.

The Bench also issued a notice to the Delhi Municipal Corporation asking it to submit details about the status of strikes. The court made the Joint Council of Health Employees a party in the case and issued a notice to it as well.

The PIL alleges that employees in government hospitals in the city have been on strike since Wednesday and are likely to continue till August 12, but authorities are making no move to solve the crisis. While the staff strike work between 7 am and 3 pm, doctors go on strike after 2 pm.

On May 20, the high court had ordered a ban on strikes by doctors and employees of All India Institute of Medical Sciences, saying disputes should be solved by a permanent negotiating machinery or a tribunal. The court ordered that no employee or staff or faculty member should cease work for any reason or disrupt work, or aid or abet such disruption in the institute.

The court had also approved measures suggested by the Centre which included formation of a permanent negotiating committee to resolve all issues relating to employees where no policy decision was involved.

13,GERC rejects move to delay metering of power to farms,"GANDHINAGAR: In a major setback to the state government, the Gujarat Electricity Regulatory Commission (GERC) has rejected the Gujarat Electricity Board's application for extending the period of metering the entire farm sector, from three to five years. The GEB had moved the application last year under pressure from state BJP rulers who, in order to please the protesting farmers against metering the sector, conveyed to GERC that the time-period given to the GEB was 'extremely short'.The state government is now faced with the stupendous task of completing metering of the farm sector by October 2003. There are in all about six lakh sector connections that will need to be metered. The GERC in its October 2000 verdict had said that the entire farm sector be metered in three years. It also demanded a plan to do that within that time-frame. The state's farmers, including the Sangh Parivar's Bharatiya Kisan Sangh, pressurised the state BJP rulers to reject the GERC verdict and, if possible, even move courts.Enjoying highly subsidised unmetered power at less than 20 paise per unit ever since metering came to an end in late 1980s, the GERC had given two options to the GEB for providing power to the farm sector - to either raise the per horse power (HP) rate from Rs 350-500 to Rs 1,680 or meter the power sector at the cost of 50 paise per unit. Calculations showed that metering would have been cheaper. Not only did the government refuse to install meters, it moved fast to keep the old HP rates. It provided a budgeted subsidy of Rs 55 crore per month, handing over the amount to the GEB as the cost of keeping the HP rate between Rs 350 and Rs 500. This has been costing the state exchequer an extra Rs 600 crore per year since October 2000. Extended just before monsoon, the subsidy is now slated to stop in October 2002. Whether the new HP rates will be initiated just when the polls are approaching is doubtful.In its verdict, the GERC rejecting the government argument that ""it is not possible to initial meters in three years"" said the issue of difficulty in installation did not arise. The GEB had not even initiated the process. It was 'premature' to talk thus. The GERC arrived at the verdict after hearing farmers, other consumers and GEB officials. Senior bureaucrats say thousands of farmers were willing to go in for metering, but political pressure did not allow the process to pick up.""The GEB had received 60,000 applications for metering"", said a top bureaucrat. ""Out of this, 20,000 meters were even installed. However, as the state government decided to go in for subsidies under BKS pressure, the whole process is on a standstill for the last 18 months. Currently, it is only under the tatkal scheme, allowing new farm connections by jumping the queue, that meters are being installed"".Under the scheme, one lakh farmers have been given connections in the last three years. The per unit cost for a tatkal meter is 70 paise, higher than the GERC tariff advise. Currently, 21,000 tatkal applications are pending with the GEB. Meanwhile, under GERC directions, a committee with representatives from farmer bodies, Consumer Education and Research Service and GEB will soon start functioning to implement the new metering verdict

14,MCA colleges double fees without consulting govt,"AHMEDABAD: For the last two years students in Gujarat have been paying Rs 12,000 each year to self-financed institutions for a free seat and a masters in computer application course (MCA) degree. What they may not know is that the state government does not allow their colleges to charge more than Rs 6,000! The colleges have doubled the fees without asking the government and no one seems to be aware of it!

In fact there is confusion over how much fee a self-financed college should charge from a student for the course. Colleges claim one amount while the government notification claims another leaving officials confused.

If one goes by the notification, self-financed colleges are allowed to charge only Rs 6,000 for a free seat. However a large chunk of them are charging exactly the double. Fees for payment seats on the other hand is Rs 40,000. The colleges are charging Rs 47,500.

""I was part of the committee which fixed the new fees,"" says former vice-chancellor M N Desai. ""We had doubled the amount. For the last two years, we have been charging Rs 47,500 for payment seats. For free seats, a student pays Rs 6,000 at the Centralised Degree Admission Committee (CDAC) to acquire an admission and then another Rs 6,000 on their first day in the college. No college is breaking any norm in taking the higher fees.""

Desai, who is associated with the National Institute of Co-operative Management, which has been taken the Rs 12,000 fee, believes fees for payment seats are expected to increase further shortly by another Rs 1,200 to admit Indian students on vacant NRI seats, and ensure that the revenue of the educational institutes does not drop.

The State Level Committee for Determination of Fees by Self-financing Institutions, however, makes no mention of this in the notification while fixing fees for the MCA course. It puts down Rs 3,000 as tuition fees and Rs 3,000 as development fees for payment seats. For payment seats, it puts down Rs 32,000 as tuition fees and Rs 8,000 as development fees.

Sources in the government''s directorate of technical education also confirmed that this was the last notification that the colleges had to follow. ""We don''t know of any other fee structure,"" the sources added.

Acting director of the Ahmedabad Education Society Institute of Computer Studies B V Mehta insists the fee is Rs 12,000. ""Perhaps the government notification talks of fees of only one term or half the year,"" he says. ""We charge the Rs 12,000 fees for the whole year."" Government officials on the other hand maintain that the Rs 6,000 fee is for the whole year, not half the year.

Director of Chaudhari Technical Institute, Gandhinagar confirmed that they charge Rs 12,000 per semester, but she was not aware if this of breaking the rule. ""We are charging fees according to the government rules only,"" she insists.

Gujarat University vice-chancellor Naresh Ved too was not aware of the discrepancy. ""I am hearing this for the first time,"" he said. ""I will check the details.""

15,SPRAT rally comes under police scrutiny,"AHMEDABAD: The Sah-Nirman rally scheduled for Friday is coming under close police scrutiny. The rally, planned by a group of voluntary organisations headed by Society for Promotion of Rational Thinking (SPRAT), plans to highlight the injustice done to riot victims and promote communal harmony.

The city police have advised the organisers against putting up ''provocative'' placards and banners. Besides, the police are upset over the proposal to carry goods damaged in the riots on camelcarts and handcarts .

The president of SPRAT M H Jowher, however, said, ""This rally propagates national integrity, communal harmony and also highlights inadequacy of riot-compensation. Persons who were widowed, orphaned, bereaved and rendered jobless will participate in this rally. If the police objects to this then let them arrest us.""

The rally will have about 15 camelcarts and 20 handcarts carrying burnt cars, damaged goods and victims who have suffered serious injuries during the riots.

Additional police commissioner (Sector II) Satish Verma told TNN, ""We have advised the rallists to avoid provocative slogans, placards, posters or displays. Under no condition can we allow anything to disrupt peace in Ahmedabad. We will not take any chances.""

Jowher said, ""We expect a total of 3,000 participants from both the communities to take part in this rally. There won''t be any political or religious overtones. This will be a peaceful rally where we will pray for peace and draw the world''s attention towards the plights of riot-hit.""

Nitaben Mahadeo of Abhikram, an NGO dealing with social issues, said, ""I decided to take part in this rally because of its secular nature. On the anniversary of the Quit India Movement, we must banish fascism and communalism.""

16,Frenetic activity in Cong before rally,"SURAT: Chalking out minute details of the rally on Friday has kept the local Congress cadre busy for the last few days. And, this lot has been praying for a respite from rains, so as to be able to hold the rally under clear sky. The party expects to have over 60,000 workers at the rally from different parts of South Gujarat.

The rally, which many see as a test of the Congress'' strength in garnering support as a prelude to the coming Assembly polls, is likely to be attended by workers from interiors of Surat district and several parts of the neighbouring Navsari, Valsad, Ahwa-Dangs, Narmada and Bharuch.

Congress city unit president Jawahar Upadhyay, who is in the core team for mobilising masses, told TNN that around 1,000 buses and other vehicles would be pressed into service to ferry party activists from different parts of South Gujarat.

Senior leaders said the party expects a lot from the rally, since it would be the first of the series of rallies in different parts of the state, aiming to create a wave in favour of the Congress in the Assembly elections. No wonder then that all big names in the party - AICC general secretary and Gujarat in-charge Kamal Nath, GPCC president Shankersinh Vaghela, Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, Leader of Opposition Amarsinh Chaudhary among others - will attend the rally.

Though the state leadership had urged Sonia Gandhi to be chief guest at the function, sources said Gandhi declined it as she was preoccupied.

Giving details of the rally, Upadhyay said Vaghela and Chaudhary will arrive at Sardar Chowk in Varachha at 2 pm and would lead the rally of over 10,000 party workers to Khand Bazar. Around 4,000 workers will join the rally at Khand Bazar. From there, the rallyists will go to the railway station where another 25,000 party workers are expected to join the rally. GPPC vice-president Kadir Pirzada said Kamal Nath, Ashok Gehlot and Ahmad Patel would join Vaghela and Chaudhary at the railway station where these leaders would garland the statue of Sardar Patel.

Upadhyay said the rally then would move to Kohinoor textile market near Ring Road via Raj Marg and Salabatpura. The rally with over 40,000 participants would be joined by over 25,000 textile traders and workers near the textile market, where Congress leaders will address the rallyists.

17,Teachers slam CU lecturer's arrest,"KOLKATA: The West Bengal College and University Teachers Association is yet to finalise a resolution criticising the arrest of Calcutta University lecturer Kaushik Ganguly and others without arrest warrants and con-demning the â€œpolitics of bloodshedâ€�.

However, a strongly worded draft resolution which reprimands the gov-ernment for arresting teachers without warrants and disapproves of â€œkhuner rajnitiâ€� was unanimously accepted on Wednesday evening and is expected to be finalised within the next 48 hours.

A five-hour marathon meeting of the associationâ€™s executive committee on Wednesday saw all parties agreeing to a common resolution. How-ever, the question of the exact language to be used saw a difference of opinion among members. Sources said the WBCUTA would officially finalise the resolution, after association general secretary Anil Bhattacharya returns to Kolkata on August 10.The resolution may also include a sentence where the WBCUTA ex-presses its â€œopposition to the politics of bloodshed and killingsâ€�.

During Tuesdayâ€™s meeting while representatives of both Left and non-Left political parties agreed to a resolution unequivocally condemning violence and expressing worry over the arrests, some senior leaders wanted the language to be toned down.

Bhattacharya who himself has been vocal about the arrest of Ganguly ever since the young lecturer was picked up from his home and packed off to Midnapore, told other members that he had spoken to CU pr-vice chancellor (academic) Suranjan Das within hours of Gangulyâ€™s arrest and requested him to intervene in the matter. â€œThe pro-vc has since issued a written statement expressing concern over the arrest of Ganguly,â€� he said.

The WBCUTA executive may now meet on Friday to draw up the final resolution which will be formally released after August 10.

18,University frames sexual harassment policy,"MUMBAI: An unwritten code always governed the manner in which students dealt with sexual harassment: they either kept it under wraps or let bellicose student unions blacken the faces of an accused teacher or principal.

The Mumbai university has decided to change that. Its womenâ€™s development cell has drafted guidelines to arbitrate sexual harassment cases, complete with provisions to punish the guilty. This expands the universityâ€™s role, which previously was limited to setting up inquiry committees.

The guidelines, which are yet to be approved by university statutory bodies, were framed after complaints of sexual harassment last year in at least four colleges. Most of the complaints were made against college principals or management officials. Though university inquiry committees found them guilty, students contended that the punishment handed out was inadequate.

The new guidelines have provisions to demote, suspend or rusticate guilty parties, as well as to protect complainants from victimisation.

For instance, the guidelines say that teachers who are under investigation cannot be appointed as examiners for students who have filed complaints. If the accused is a management official, the person will be barred from preparing confidential reports about the complainant if the latter is a member of the staff.

â€œWith these guidelines, we hope the cell will act as a deterrent,â€™â€™ says C.R. Sadasivan, a member of the cell and a teachersâ€™ union representative.

The guidelines say that colleges should also have a womenâ€™s development cell to investigate complaints of sexual harassment, among other things. Students can appeal decisions by college cells at the university level, says Kranti Jejurkar, a cell member.

Still, the experience at a couple of city educational institutions shows that these cells can be effective only if attitudes also change. Officials at the cells at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (Tiss) and SNDT Womenâ€™s University say that the most difficult part is convincing students to come forward with complaints.

Students donâ€™t complain about sexual harassment because they are worried about their careers, explains Asha Bajpai, a member of the Tiss law faculty and also of the committee there that considers sexual harassment complaints. She says that this is especially true in professional courses, where a single teacher is in charge of exams, assessment and practicals. Four years ago, Ms Bajpai conducted a study on sexual harassment on campus. Thirty-nine per cent of the female students and teachers she interviewed said that sexual harassment or discrimination was prevalent in city colleges and universities.

Despite this, officials at most cells say cases have never progressed far enough for them to have to decide on punishment. â€œMost students back out after making complaints, while others prefer to settle it among themselves,â€™â€™ says Ms Bajpai. Tiss is working to amend the cellâ€™s policies to make it more approachable.

Similarly, SNDT university recently converted its sexual harassment cell into a statutory body, which will make its recommendations binding on other university bodies. Harsha Parikh, a member of the cell and the head of the library science department, says that the SNDT cell has received only two complaints since its inception in 1997. This is because it is a womenâ€™s university, she explains.

The SNDT cell was established soon after the University Grants Commission, the body that governs higher education in the country, asked educational institutes to set up mechanisms to deal with sexual harassment. This followed a Supreme Court order to the effect.

Mumbai university, meanwhile, established its cell only last October, after repeated demands by the teachers union.

Mihir Desai, a representative of the India Centre for Human Rights and Law, whom the Mumbai university consulted while drafting the guidelines, warns that such cells shouldnâ€™t function merely to dole out punishments. He suggests: â€œThey should also have counselling facilities to smoothen relationships.â€™â€™

19,Cong plans Bengal bandh during Advani's visit next month,"KOLKATA: Even as the Left Front prepares to hold a rally on Sunday, August 11, to protest bifurcation of Eastern Railway and trifurcation of South-Eastern Railway, the Congress on Thursday suggested a Bangla Bandh, endorsed by all parties, to greet the deputy prime minister L.K. Advani when he visits the state next month.

In a letter to the chief minister, Congress chief whip in state assembly Abdul Mannan said that the bandh should be organized to protest centreâ€™s shabby treatment of the state legislature and the people of West Bengal.

Mannan and WBPCC senior leader Somen Mitra called on Bhattacharjee and suggested that the latter convene an all-party meeting to review the siutation before Advaniâ€™s visit, expected on September 7 or 8.

The chief minister promised to examine the proposal. Mitra said bifurcation of the Eastern Railway and trifurcation of the South Eastern Railway would hit the interest of the state hard. â€œFor once, all political parties in the state should unite on this issue.â€� The Congress could come together with CPM and Trinamul Congress on this.

The Congress leaders, however, gave a rider. The agitation against railway bifurcation should be in the interest of the state and not in the personal interest of anyone, they said, taking a dig at Trinamul Congress leader Mamata Banerjee. Elaborating, Mitra said the Trinamul Congress had first decided to launch an agitation in protest against railway bifurcation, but it was kept in abeynace when the time came for expansion of the Union cabinet.

When the expansion was over, the Trinamul Congress went for another phase of agitation. Meanwhile, the Trinamul Congress is likely to stay away from the NDA meeting in Delhi on August 11, where vice-presidential candidate Bhairon Singh Shekhawat is to be formally introduced to alliance partners. It is also uncertain whether the party has been formally invited to the meet. â€œWe are not giving the meeting too much importance. It is a routine meeting. Mamata Banerjee will decide whether to attend the meeting or not,â€� said Trinamul leader Pankaj Banerjee. On whether the party has received formal invitation to the meeting, Banerjee said, â€œRoutine letters are sent to all parties concerned.â€�

20,CPM gives CM free hand on enacting anti-terrorism law,"KOLKATA: The chief minister has finally received the green signal from the party to go ahead with an anti-terrorist law.

CPM politburo member and state secretary Anil Biswas told a television channel that the state government would enact such a law, whatever be the nomenclature. â€œThe danger posed by terrorism must be understood. We prefer to take action before it can spread further,â€� he insisted.

The CPM party leader also said his party was presently busy convincing the other Left parties on why it had become a necessity to have such a law.

About two months ago, the chief ministerâ€™s attempts to introduce Prevention of Organised Crime Act (Poca) in the assembly had been stalled after several Left Front partners, including the CPI, RSP and the Forward Bloc, raised objections. Poca had faced resistance even from within the CPM. Several politburo members including Sitaram Yechury and Prakash Karat had objected to Poca as they felt that if the Left Front government introduced such an act, the CPMâ€™s fight against the Centreâ€™s Prevention of Terrorism Act (Pota) would lose steam. CPM sources explained that introduction of Poca had become necessary to deal not only with ISI backed terrorism and the rise of the Naxalite Peopleâ€™s War but also to effectively tackle the emerging and growing social unrest because of increasing retrenchment and unemployment.

While CPI, RSP and Forward Bloc leaders refused to go on record, senior leaders of the three parties said that they would once again oppose attempts to enact anysuch law. The threat of terrorism was being blown out of proportion by many. The existing laws of the land were sufficient to deal with the problem, they felt.

21,Co-operative bank ex-chairman arrested in Home Trade scam case,"PUNE: After dodging the authorities for more than three months to avoid arrest in the government securities scam, former chairman of the Osmanabad district central co-operative bank (DCCB) Pawanraje Nimbalkar was finally surrounded by the police at a city hospital on Thursday.

Nimbalkar (55) is wanted by the police for allegedly conniving with private broking firm Home Trade Ltd which failed to give physical delivery of government securities worth Rs 33 crore.

In a day marked by dramatic developments, a police team from the Osmanabad crime branch finally caught up with the legislator, who has been admitted to the Inlaks and Budhrani hospital at 5.30 am on Thursday. After ascertaining his identity, the investigating official placed Nimbalkar under vigil with police personnel posted all around the hospital.

Although the police had completed all the formalities of placing Nimbalkar under arrest, he could not be produced before the magistrate for medical reasons. Technically, Nimbalkar is still not in the custody of the police. Police officials said a formal arrest could not be effected as Nimbalkar was in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of the hospital.

A doctor at the hospital said Nimbalkar had a cardiac ailment. ""Nimbalkar''s ECG was showing changes,"" he said. The doctor claimed that Nimbalkar could not be released at least for the next two days. Interestingly, the indicted bank chairman had undergone an angiography test at the Ruby Hall clinic on Wednesday which, apparently, does not show any dangerous signs, said sources.

Police inspector Ramesh Jadhav of the Osmanabad crime branch told TNN that the team got a tip-off from its intelligence network on Nimbalkar''s movement to Pune on Wednesday afternoon. Two parties left for Pune in the evening and reached the city at 3.30 am, he said. ""After searching all major hospitals in the city, we finally saw Nimbalkar''s car at Inlaks and Budhrani,"" he said.

Jadhav said the police have been keeping a strict watch on the hospital, especially on the ICU, nothwithstanding some objections raised by the hospital.

Sources said senior officials from the criminal investigation department (CID) in Pune also visited the hospital to review the complicated situation arising out of medical formalities.

Police officials posted at the hospital said Osmanabad superintendent of police Prabhat Kumar was constantly in touch with director general of police Subhash Malhotra. In all probability, Nimbalkar might be formally arrested on Friday after taking permission from the hospital authorities, add sources.

Meanwhile, minister of state for home Kripashankar Singh, while addressing a press conference here on Thursday, said he had been intimated by the police about the arrest of Nimbalkar. He refused to speculate on the future course of action against Nimbalkar who is related to a state cabinet minister.

24,Police arrests LeT militant,"HOSHIARPUR: With the arrest of Kashaddin alias Rashid another Lashkar-e-Toiba militant by the Hoshiarpur police the involvement of nomadic tribes in militancy gains greater significance. Rashid, who originally hails from Udhampur, belongs to the Bakkarwal tribe a tribe similar to the Gujjars).

He was caught near Mukerian during a special operation conducted by the police from the vicinity of his hideout in Gujjar areas. Addressing a joint press conference Rohit Chaudhary DIG, Jalandhar Range and Gurpreet Deo, SSP Hoshiarpur told mediapersons that Rashid was involved in bomb blasts that took place in Hoshiarpur city and in a bus in Garhshankar.

According to Chaudhary, Rashid was also involved in the Damtal firing on January 1, 2002 and the Doraha Train Blast.

This is the third LeT militant arrested in Punjab after Abdul and Makhan Gujjar. Rashidâ€™s arrest comes at a time when the deputy Prime Minister LK Advani has openly suggested LeTâ€™s involvement in the killing of nine Amarnath Yatris, four days ago.

According to Gurpreet Deo, Rashidâ€™s interrogation has revealed that he was trained to use sophisticated weapons like the AK-47 and AK-56 by one Farooq Ansari who was an Area Commander of the Hizbul Mujaheedin.

According to Deo, Rashid had claimed that he was trained in a camp in Sehooz Dhar in Udhampur district. He was then offered Rs 3 lakh to join the rank of the militants. According to Deo, Rashid then came in contact with Iqbal, an active LeT member of Kathua district and LeT happily recruited him to carry out subversive activities in Punjab.

According to the SSP, Rashid was in close contact with Sher Khan, area commander of Laskar-e-Toiba in the Doda region and there was every possibility that instructions to carry out terrorist activities in Punjab came from Sher Khan. With the arrest of Rashid the police claims that only Iqbal and Joginder Hoshiarpuri remain to be arrested, as they were also involved in Damtal firing and the Hoshiarpur bomb blasts.
