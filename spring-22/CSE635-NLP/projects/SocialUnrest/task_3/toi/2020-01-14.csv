0,BJP ridicules Cong protests against state govt,"PATNA: The BJP has ridiculed the Congress Party for staging protests against the state government and declared it an eyewash. Partyâ€™s vice-president Kiran Ghai and MLC Kamehswar Chaupal alleged that the Congress has always been opposed to development.

Congress has been sticking to a corrupt and repressive regime in Bihar just for the lust of power. The party is trying to make an abortive bid to fool the people by playing the role of an opposition while remaining in power, they alleged.

They further said that the Congress was a part of the criminal and police raj created by the government. ""If the party wants to oppose the ruling party, it first withdraw its support,"" Ghai alleged.

5,Tehelka was a mistake by govt: Naipaul,"NEW DELHI: Creating a fresh flutter, Nobel laureate V S Naipaul on Tuesday expressed his profound disappointment over the treatment of Tehelka by the Centre and said he expected that at some point of time the government will withdraw from the ""sorry state of affairs"" admitting its ""lack of graciousness"".

""I am profoundly disappointed over what happened to Tehelka which can damage the country,"" Naipaul, one of the directors on the board of Tehelka, told reporters here.

Concerned over the ""crushing of intellectual life"" in the country, he said writers and books were not the only ones which could make the country look into itself but good journalism is very important for the process.

However, Naipaul, who was accompanied by his wife Nadira, and Tehelka Managing Editor Tarun Tejpal at the press conference, said he still had confidence in and goodwill for BJP even after what happened to Tehelka and Gujarat.

""Tehelka was a mistake by the government,"" he said.

Nadira said they (she and her husband) had met Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani to express their concern over the ""grave situation"".

""It was a very good meeting. The Deputy Prime Minister gave us a very patient hearing and assured us that he will look into the matter,"" Nadira said.

Expressing hope that ""something good"" will come out of the whole incident, Naipaul said from the ""ashes"" of Tehelka, something good and positive will come out.

Reiterating that the news portal will not participate in further proceedings of the Commission of Inquiry despite the appointment of a new judge, its Managing Editor Tarun Tejpal, however, said it will continue to cooperate with the authorities in every possible way.

Asked about the future of Tehelka, facing a financial crisis, Tejpal said the news portal was not going to die down and might come out in the shape of a news weekly.

""For the past two years the news portal has faced harassment. But we will fight it out,"" Tejpal said.

Emphasising that he was no ""political"" person, Naipaul said his ""anxiety"" over how things will resolve in the Tehelka matter brought him before the media.
