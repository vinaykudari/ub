0,Sangh outfit demands central rule in Gujarat,"GANDHINAGAR: The confrontation between Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi and Bhartiya Kisan Sangh, Sangh Parivarâ€™s farmer wing, has taken an unprecedented turn. The BKS has actually demanded imposition of Presidentâ€™s Rule in Gujarat.

In a statement issued here on Wednesday, the powerful farmers body said Modi had systematically tried to bend and break the democratic principles of the Constitution.

State cabinet spokesman IK Jadeja refused to comment.

â€œWe request the Gujarat governor to use his consitutional powers by imposing Presidentâ€™s Rule for a short period in the general interest, as also in the interest of the farmers. This alone would free the farmers from the government-sponsored terror on the farmers,â€� the statement, signed by BKS state general secretary Maganbhai Patel, said.

As already reported, state BJP president Rajendrasinh Rana had asked central party leaders last week to intervene to resolve the increasingly worrying standoff. However, even he didnâ€™t anticipate such a turn.

The BKS has given as many as 16 reasons why it wants Presidentâ€™s Rule. It said Modi had been breaking elected municipalities and panchayats, using police to repress people, behaving in a high-handed manner with different organisations, refusing to enter into any dialogue with aggrieved groups and giving oral instructions to suppress farmers.

\

The statement further accused Modi of misusing public money, giving anonymous advertisements in the newspapers against the farmers, arbitrarily cutting electricity connections for farmers, imposing commercial power rates on them, refusing to provide an objective administration and so on.

Modi had, last week, got the head office evicted from its state-owned quarters and, it is alleged, power connections of taluka and district level BKS office-bearers were being snapped without any notice from the Gujarat Electricity Board.

â€œA definite procedure has to be followed. The GEB must first give notice to the farmers. Only after the notice period is over can the connections be snapped,â€� said Patel. He said, â€œOral instructions from Modi were given to selectively snap power connections of the BKS office bearers. This is nothing but a terror-tactic.â€�

2,"Gas prices hike ruled out, oil reserve on","NEW DELHI: The Cabinet on Wednesday put off a proposal to raise gas prices to avoid the ire of consumers ahead of elections but approved the creation of a strategic oil reserve as an assurance that the kitchen fires will not be affected by the reforms in the petroleum sector.

A ministerial panel had recommended raising natural gas prices by Rs 350 per thousand cubic metres. Implementing the recommendation would have pushed up the prices of cooking gas, fertilisers and power, a move that could have been electorally disastrous for the ruling coalition seeking another term at the Centre. Besides, auto, bus and taxi fares in Delhi and Mumbai would have also gone up as CNG prices would have increased by up to Rs 2 per kg.

The Cabinet also approved a proposal to spend Rs 1,650 crore on creating a strategic reserve of five million tonnes of crude oil, expected to keep the supply lines going for a fortnight in case of any disruption.

Oil minister Ram Naik said the stockpile, to be stored in rock caverns at two locations near Mangalore in Karnataka and Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh, respectively, will be built on the lines of those maintained by the US and Japan as an insurance against supply disruptions. The reserves will be in addition to the 60 days stocks of crude and petroleum products maintained by the the refining companies. At current prices, the crude oil stocks will cost Rs 5,000 crore.

3,DF govt seeks legal opinion on action against US author,"MUMBAI: The Congress-led Democratic Front (DF) is seeking expert legal opinion on whether action can be initiated against American author James Laine for his ""negative portrayal"" of Chhatrapati Shivaji in his book A Hindu King in Islamic India .

""No person in Maharashtra will tolerate any objectionable reference to Chhatrapati Shivaji. So we are asking for advice from the legal fraternity if we can initiate action against the author,"" said state home minister R.R. Patil in Mantralaya on Wednesday.

Mr Patil, however, was quick to condemn the ransacking of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute in Pune by a fanatical offshoot of the Maratha Seva Sangh.

""It is highly deplorable on part of the group to attack and destroy the research institute. We have already arrested 72 people and have charged them for the rampage in the institute premises,"" Mr Patil said.

The attackers included a senior functionary of the Sangh, Prakash Khedekar, who works with the state Public Works Department. Mr Khedekarâ€™s wife Rekha is a BJP MLA.

4,SIT arrests 'encounter specialist' Sawant,"MUMBAI: Deputy commissioner of police (special branch) Pradeep Sawant was arrested on Wednesday by the special investigation team (SIT) probing the Rs 3,000-crore fake stamp paper scam. He is the 16th police officer to be arrested in the case.

Sawant, who was DCP in the Mumbai crime branch from March 2000 to November 2003, was grilled by the SIT for over five hours before being booked under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Control Act (MCOCA).

He will be been taken to Pune to be produced before a court. The SIT also raided his house in central Mumbai.

The SIT has accused Sawant of playing a significant role in the scam between May 2002 and January 2003, when his subordinate officers allegedly went ""soft"" on scam kingpin Abdul Telgi.

A handsome media-savvy officer, Sawant was in the good books of several superior officers for his good track record, his proximity to some senior politicians and his ability to lead a team that included three ""encounter specialists"".

He was instrumental in breaking the back of several underworld gangs such as Chhota Rajan, Chhota Shakeel, Arun Gawli and Ashwin Naik between 1999 and 2000 following a spurt in gangland shoot-outs in 1998.

Known to be close to former deputy chief minister Chhagan Bhujbal''s nephew, Sameer,whose role is also being probed in the scam, Sawant has been accused of seeking favours from Telgi for going soft against the latter in Mumbai cases.

Sawant has been interrogated on four earlier occasions by the SIT. The state home department sidelined him in November last year by posting him to the special branch.

5,'Policing of Rlys a state govt duty',"PATNA: Railway minister Nitish Kumar said that he has so far failed to understand the reason behind the existence of a law which authorised the state governments to receive a regular payment from the railway ministry for policing on railways premises.

""Policing is completely a state subject. This is the duty of any state government to make arrangement for proper policing under its jurisdiction. Policing on railway premises should not be treated as an additional work of the state government. Did you ever hear that residents of any locality pay any special tax for policing in their areas?"" the minister asked while addressing a gathering at the 12th conference of All India RPF Association at Srikrishna Memorial Hall here on Wednesday. The minister claimed that he had already paid all the dues owned by his ministry to the state government for policing by the GRP.

The minister also asked the RPF men to be responsible as far as the safety of train passengers in the running trains is concerned. He told them, ""we have amended the Railways Act and RPF Act. Now you will be able to escort a train. Co-ordinate with the GRP and share your intelligence. Steps are being taken to impart proper training."" The minister also criticised the state government for not making proper arrangement to strengthen the Bihar police in the face of new challenges. ""Jawans of Bihar police are neither given proper training nor opportunity to attend refresher courses.

Even the vehicles, owned by Bihar, is known as ""thelco gari"". Awaj aisi ki criminal sunkar samjh jate police aa gayee hai,"" he remarked. The minister also condemned the recent molestation bid of Kashmiri girls in the running Himgiri Express.

6,Gangrape victim commits suicide,"AHMEDABAD: Unable to get over her trauma, a 24-year-old, gangraped by her lover and his friends at a city hotel on New Yearâ€™s eve, committed suicide on Tuesday morning.

The girl hanged herself to death with a dupatta at her house in Panchsheel locality of Naranpura here.

She was raped in a room at the Ashok Palace hotel in Shahibaug area on December 31 night.

In a police complaint, she had named five persons for the crime, including Sajal Jain, a Delhiite, who she was in love with.

Three of the accused â€” Chander Jaiswal, son of the hotelâ€™s owner, Mandan Jaiswal and Sugam Jaiswal â€” have been arrested. All three are local residents.

Sajal Jain and the fifth accused, Karan Jain of Jaipur, are still at large. Separate police teams have been sent to Delhi and Jaipur to nab the two, said assistant commissioner of police S P Oza.

Sajal and the girl knew each other for the past 18 months and kept in touch on the telephone, said the police.

The girl had been invited to a party by Chandar, who was also known to her. The girl first went to a farmhouse in the Sarkhej suburb with a group of friends for a New Year party. Later, she left for Ashok Palace Hotel to meet Sajal.

The police believe she was lured into a trap set by Sajal. She was taken to a room, where she was allegedly forced to drink beer, slapped and gangraped by the five.

The girl was reportedly in a state of shock for the past week. Her brother, who deals in printing machinery, found the body at 10.45 am on Wednesday.

7,"In wildlife institute, director goes extinct","NEW DELHI: In what one conservationist describes as the messiest story of academia, the governmentâ€™s prestigious Wildlife Institute of India has been without a full-time director so long the post has been deemed abolished. In addition, some of its faculty is in court, fighting a battle on the rules of consultancy money sharing.

â€˜â€˜Itâ€™s a headless chicken,â€™â€™ says a conservationist who doesnâ€™t want to be identified. â€˜â€˜A horror story of cliques, political rivalries, very little academia, probably the most depressing story of Indian wildlife.â€™â€™

Some scientists have fled what conservationists describe as a unique institution, one of the few such in a developing country.

This Dehra Dun-based institute, formed in 1982, was tasked with the job of producing a cadre of wildlife managers and field biologists. The institute society is headed by none other than the Union environment minister while the governing body is headed by the ministryâ€™s secretary. In recognition of its potential, Unesco identified it as the regional training centre for south and south-east Asia.

Yet, for nearly two years, this institute has been allowed to slide. It has had no full-time director, the leadership being left to people merely holding additional charge. Salary hasnâ€™t been drawn against the post.

Government rules stipulate that any post vacant for more than a year will be deemed abolished, says a source. So, after finally selecting a candidate nearly six months ago, the ministry is unable to appoint him.

It says it has written to the finance ministry to revive the post and is hopeful of getting the green signal soon. Faced with this absurd situation, ministry mandarins condemn the â€˜â€˜unnecessary bureaucracyâ€™â€™ which has forced them to move the finance ministry. Why, they wonder, should the abolition rule apply when the process for filling up the post has been on and someone has been holding additional charge.

Conservationists, however, are unsparing, unable to understand why the government dragged its feet so long. â€˜â€˜What was the difficulty in finding a candidate for an institution which was the pride of India?â€™â€™ asks conservationist Ashok Kumar. Nobody is willing to answer.

11,Seven killed in intra-community clash,"AHMEDABAD: Seven persons, including three women and four children, were hacked and bludgeoned to death on Thursday evening. Police officials said that a group clash within the nomadic Vanzara community members had resulted in the massacre.

Thirteen persons were injured in the incident that took place around 7.30 pm at Baldana village, a rural settlement of Ahmedabad district about 26 km from heart of the city.

However Superintendent of Police Ahmedabad (rural), Manoj Agarwal, was ""not clear"" about the cause behind the massacre as investigations into the episode went on till late in the night.

""The clash was apparently the result of some minor dispute between two groups of the Vanzara community,"" Agarwal said. The three probable causes behind the clash that the police were exploring were: eve teasing, fight over right to occupy a particular plot of tillable land or over the ownership of cattle.

A couple of days before this incident took place, a minor clash between the two groups had taken place but was temporarily sorted out by elders of the community. However on Thursday evening matters came to a pass as this group of women and children were attacked by some unidentified group of four miscreants.

The injured have been admitted in the Civil and VS Hospitals.

12,Probe VRS plan: Power minister,"NEW DELHI: Delhi power minister Haroon Yusuf has ordered an inquiry in to the voluntary retirement scheme (VRS) floated by the private power distribution companies on Thursday. It is however still not clear as to who will foot the bill for the Rs 500 crore VRS plan of 6,000 employees.

â€˜â€˜We will ask the private companies how they plan to provide the money for the VRS scheme,â€™â€™ Yusuf said. He said the government had no plans to pay for the medical, gratuity and terminal benefits of the former Delhi Vidyut Board (DVB) employees.

Private companies BSES and North Delhi Power Limited (NDPL) initiated a VRS plan last month that promised post-retirement benefits from the government controlled terminal benefit fund.

The government has denied giving permission to the private companies to use the fund. â€˜â€˜If BSES and NDPL approachm, us we will consider the matter but for the moment no proposal has been sent to us,â€™â€™ Yusuf said. BSES and NDPL said that they have received approvals from their respective boards regarding the VRS plan.

The tripartite agreement signed between the Delhi government and private companies clearly states that the fund can only be used for superannuation or when employees reach 60 years of age. â€˜â€˜This condition was laid so that the capital is not affected and employees can be given benefits through the funds generated by the rate of interest,â€™â€™ an official added.

According to officials, if the private companies have to shell out the amount for the VRS scheme, they might pass on the burden to the consumers. Yusuf said, â€˜â€˜We will ensure that consumers will not have to bear the burden of VRS with a hike in tariff.â€™â€™
