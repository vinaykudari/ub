""even nepal and bangladesh are not extending full support to india while the us and china are openly supporting pakistan,"" he said. the sp president said that when he was defence minister he framed a law to ensure that bodies of soldiers killed on the borders should be sent to their native villages for last rites. ""but the present government is accepting commission in the purchase of coffins for soldiers,"" he added. yadav said that he was in favour of attacking terrorist camps being run in the pak occupied kashmir (pok) by pakistan. ""but the nda government did not listen to my pleas and finally gen musharraf succeeded in moulding international support in the favour of his country,"" he said adding that had the government given proper attention to his pleas the attack on india parliament by militants supported by pakistan could be avoided. hitting out at the central government for following a faulty agricultural policy, he said that dozens of farmers in orissa committed suicide due to starvation and the government could not provide foodstuff to them. he said if his party would form the government in the state he would personally ensure that rural areas get round-the-clock electricity supply. besides, traders and students would not be harassed by police for no fault of theirs and steps would be taken to provide remunerative prices to farmers for their produce, yadav added. claiming that the sp was totally against fielding criminals in the elections, he said that his party if voted to power would provide free medical treatment to government employees and. besides, rs 10 lakh compensation would be given to family members of policemen who would be killed while performing their duties, he said. hitting out at the central government for bowing to pressure tactics being adopted by international monetary fund and the world bank, yadav said that it was really shocking that the government was giving even the profit-making psus to private parties at throwaway prices. ""while cheap products from china have flooded the market, the indigenous industries are facing closures,"" he said. criticising the rajnath government for creating a communal divide in the state, he said that innocent muslims youths, who had no links with the simi, were put behind the bars in bahraich and other parts of the state. claiming that the central government was also planning to close down aligarh muslim university (amu), yadav said terrorism could not be checked by introducing poto or any other ordinance.

5,Kerala farmers set up neera kiosks,"kozhikode: inspired by the success of a similar stir in neighbouring karnataka, an agitation by coconut farmers demanding total rights, including tapping, on their palms, is fast catching on in kerala. as parlours to sell 'neera' (sweet toddy) by the farmers themselves are mushrooming in the hilly hamlets and towns of the malabar region defying laws, an agressive stir follows suit in the central and southern districts of the coastal state. if the farmers of karnataka had to pay a huge price -- death of a few activists -- for the success of their agitation, the arrest of senior leaders of the farmers relief forum, which is spearheading the campaign for violating the existing abkari act, has proved the catalyst for the kerala farmers. moreover, a fall of prices of agro-produce and reports of increasing number of suicides by the desperate farmers have drawn the farmers wider support from outside the community. even as the struggle is fast turning into a headache for the antony government, the state's powerful ezhava community, which traditionally has the largest number of tappers, is vehemently opposing the stir. the agitation was first launched at nadavayal of the hilly north-eastern district of wayanad on december 17 with a farmers' gathering openly selling neera, tapped by themselves from the palms. forum chairman m c varkey was taken into custody for leading the stir on december 22. ever since, it has been a steady progress with the stir taking to newer places and wooing larger number of farmers, despite more leaders being put behind bars. the agitation entered a new phase with the forum setting up parlours before the collectorates of wayanad, kannur, kozhikode and palakkad. the farmers, with lit candles, also held a night vigil here the other day.

7,"Bathinda, Lambi choice may reflect on Maghi rally","bathinda: while the surprise choice of surinder singla, an outside congress candidate for bathinda seat served a blow to the rank and file besides the main contenders for the seat here, the denial of congress ticket to mahesh inder singh, the cousin of punjab chief minister, for lambi constituency has left many in the party circles astounded. the supporters of mahesh inder singh and jagmeet singh brar are in shock at the denial of the ticket to the cousin of the chief minister, who was reportedly brought to the party fold by jagmeet singh brar with an assurance of a ticket for lambi constituency two months back. the supporters of mahesh inder were so confident of getting ticket that they had formally launched campaign in his favour and mahesh was also following up complaints of tampering of voters list and enrolment of fake voters in the area. the party has announced the name of gurnam singh abul khurana for lambi seat. earlier, raghubir singh, the president of muktsar dcc and ticket nominee for gidderbaha seat had joined the chorus with jagmeet singh brar demanding aticket for mahesh. with new political equations in the area, mahesh inder singh called a meeting of his supporters on monday to chalk out strategy, and supporters of jagmeet singh brar are reportedly taking no interest in moving people for the maghi rally. sources close to jagmeet singh brar said the presence of brar was still doubtful at the rally, which was earlier being organised by dcc under the leadership of raghubir singh, is now being structured by avtar singh sidhu, the president of muktsar block. sidhu is a close confidant of amarinder singh. while the most of senior congress leaders in bathinda maintained low profile and avoided comment on the choice surinder singla, a former rajya sabha member from samana in patiala district, the resentment was palpable among the party workers who had gathered at the party district office here on sunday. the congress party office here was reverberating with indignant tones as the party workers were resentful of the allotment of the party ticket to an outsider and strange person to the area. while some office-bearers of the party were venting their anger against the party high command, most of the workers and sarpanches of some villages of the constituency said the choice of surinder singla for the seat would dampen the chances of the party at the hustings. however, everyone was trying to figure out the reasoning for fielding singla from the seat. meanwhile, political pundits in the area said that the distribution of tickets in muktsar, faridkot and bathinda and annoyance of jagmeet brar camp would have an impact at maghi mela rally scheduled to be held at muktsar, the fiefdom of jagmeet singh brar and parkash singh badal, on monday.
