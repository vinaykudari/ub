3,NIC slices thru election clutter,"BANGALORE: The election bandwagon comprising godmen, swamijis, moulvis, singers, actors, actresses, politicians, their raths and yatras, and the commonman may resemble a circus. Yet, itâ€™s the most hi-tech operation ever carried out.

As a billion people go to the elections, one of the largest networks will feed and process data, making the formation of the 14th Lok Sabha a breeze in relative terms.

We are not talking about electronic voting machines, but the National Informatics Centre, or NIC, which is a central government agency networked as NicNet across 603 districts.

Consider the stupendous manpower managing the election process. In Karnataka alone, the Election Commission is identifying around 3 lakh officials to man 39,656 polling booths in 27 districts.

The EC has a mammoth job on its hand: store, streamline, and access huge amount of data on people, processes, logistics and other infrastructure required for pre-, post- and during elections. And, for the first time ever, it will bank on the state-of-the-art technology for the mammoth exercise.

Abhijit Dasgupta, chief electoral officer (Karnataka), says the electronic management of data will help the commission create a system that can be in constant touch with the electorate across the country throughout the exercise.

While the NIC has developed a comprehensive management information system for data management, storing and recovery, the CMC has designed a website: http://ceokarnataka.kar.nic.in. The website will carry details on candidates, their affidavit, personal details, criminal background and parties they belong to, their candidature and election symbols.

â€œIt is important to facilitate greater availability of information to the electorate, so that they can exercise their franchise meaningfully,â€� says Dasgupta. The NIC has just hosted the site that can be accessed across the country.â€œWe will paste information cleared by the EC almost on a realtime basis,â€� says B.V. Sharma, senior technical director, NIC. To facilitate realtime information flow, NIC has established a 24/7 radio frequency link with the offices of chief electoral officers across the country.

With pre-election activities gaining momentum, over 4,000 NIC officials are busy working on various poll-related projects.

The NIC has also entered into a national election content-sharing arrangement with the Doordarshan. With this, even regional DD kendras can access NIC websites for election updates. The stories will carry NIC creditline, via NicNet.

4,Bell rings and chaos rules,"LUCKNOW: Even the best schools in the city may not be able to take 100 per cent care of your child. With numerous vehicles parked outside the school that take to the road once the final bell rings, one can only hope that students do not face a mishap.

Taking note of serious parking problems in school zones, the police directed some reputed schools to create parking space inside their premises for its students.

A walk down Shahnajaf Road on any afternoon only adds strength to the issue. A major traffic congestion occurs in front of St Francis College once the school closes. A fleet of cars, bikes and rickshaws crawling in the surrounding area of the college makes it look as if the first day, first show of a blockbuster has come to an end.

Not only is there chaos on the road outside the school, but it poses a threat to safety of students too. ""As soon as students hear the last bell, they throng the school gates to get to their vehicles and go home. This creates a lot of problems for traffic moving outside.

Not surprisingly this has been a cause of minor accidents in the past. The school continues to be indifferent towards safe parking for its students,"" said Mohammed Arif, who works in a shop in the area.

Loreto Convent is another school which has overlooked the issue of parking for students and left it to them to manage their vehicles outside. Daily chaos is a given, once the school closes. School authorities were approached, but were not forthcoming on the issue.

Similarly, Gomtinagar and Jopling Road branches of City Montessori School have paid no attention to safety of students, as well as clogged traffic movement on road.

SP (traffic), Omkar Singh said, ""CMS Gomtinagar has one of the largest auditoriums among city schools, but no one spared a thought for commuters on the road outside.

The pavement in front of the schoolâ€™s gate has apparently become the property of the college with four-wheelers blocking the narrow lane on several occasions. College authorities should have developed sufficient parking space while the map was being laid out"".

5,Teachers' demonstration turns ugly,"LUCKNOW: Members of the UP Secondary Education Teachersâ€™ Association and managers of private schools came to blows outside the office of the district inspector of schools (DIOS) on Saturday. The teachers were demonstrating to protest mass-copying in the UP Board examinations in private schools, when managers of private schools arrived on the scene and launched a â€˜counter-offensiveâ€™.

The teachers were demanding action against 12 private schools and colleges, where, they alleged, masscopying was being facilitated by the management itself, in connivance with the education department officials.

Soon after their demonstration began, a group of school managers led by Hawaldar Singh Yadav, president of the UP Unaided School Managersâ€™ Association arrived at the DIOSâ€™ office. The two groups entered into a verbal duel and then came to blows with each other, till the district administration officials intervened.

Teachers alleged the school managers were escorted by â€˜gunnersâ€™, who even issued life threats. ""School managers relented only when the city magistrate warned them the arms of their private gunners would be seized,"" said RP Mishra, district president of the teachersâ€™ association. He said: ""Money was being demanded from private candidates for copying in examinations and those who refused to pay up were being harassed.""

Similarly, teachers, who do not cooperate in the mass-copying were being threatened. According to the rules, managers are not allowed inside the examination centre during the examinations. However, these managers could be seen openly roaming inside the classrooms, he said.

Refuting these charges, school managers charged the teachersâ€™ leaders with indulging in politics to harass the managements of private schools, who have refused to toe their line. ""These teacher leaders never teach in class and vitiate the academic atmosphere through their activities,"" he accused. The managers said the DIOS should deploy teacher leaders as the centre incharges and invigilators in their schools, so that they could see for themselves that no copying was being allowed during the UP Board examinations.
