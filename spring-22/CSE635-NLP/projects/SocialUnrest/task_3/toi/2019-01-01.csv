3,Police arrest Gabbar aide,"kolkata: after the arrest of gangster gabbar, city police arrested another most wanted crimelord and former aide of gabbar, sona alias mohammed faiuddin (25) from a north kolkata locality on sunday night, deputy commissioner (central division) zulfiquar hassan said. ""far more dangerous than gabbar as far as his ice cool-temperament is concerned, the under-world don turned real-estate dealer has amassed wealth worth crores of rupees,"" the police said. sona is also wanted in a khadim vice-charmain partha roy burman abduction case. inspector general cid partha bhattacharya said that sona was involved in the abduction as a facilitator and local link-man. he identified roy burman and supplied vital tip-off about roy burman's movement in tiljala vicinity. wanted for a number of criminal acts ranging from murder, abduction, extortion, sona's claim to notoriety, however, is his command over the narcotics business. the nerve centre is ghulam zilani road in tiljala. earlier, he was arrested twice on the charges of murder of badsha and sadiq in 1997 and 1998, but on both the occasion he absconded. with his intelligent bespectacled look, frail structure and convent education background, sona is the last person looking like a gangster. yet he survived so long because of his intelligence. unlike gabbar, he is free from vices like alcohol and womanising. his only aim was to earn money. sona's relations with gabbar is an interesting study of ever-changing equations in the under-world. it was sona's brain and gabbar's brawn that brought the duo under limelight. a trusted henchman and partner in crime for gabbar since early 1990s, sona severed his tie with gabbar after a serious confrontation over the share of extortion money from drug dealings. while gabbar had to turn a fugitive for murdering bunty, sona found a new ally in tiljala strongman chunnu miyan. sona said to police that chunnu being ""criminally"" honest was easy to stay with as partner in crime as well as in building up the estate. he even lived at sapgachi lane in tiljala next to chunnu miyan's house. he possessed a number of cars, one of which, a air-conditioned santro used to be driven by her wife, who was equallty smart, according to the police. the police said both gabbar and sona were initiated into the world of crime by mehmood akhtar of ripon street in 1986. both gabbar and sona used to be from the same neighbourhood. as akhtar had already passed his prime, they dissociated from akhtar and formed their own gang. after his separation with gabbar, most of gabbar's gang-members went to the side of sona. sona had also built a counter-intelligence network among criminals. after the abduction of partha roy burman, sona was missing, though chunnu was brought to book. a number of raids at his native village in darbhanga and his in-law's house in hajipur and sasaram proved futile.

""the doctors ruled out the possibility of death due to a road accident,"" mr paithankar said. ""there were no superficial wounds on the body but the bleeding from the nose and the ear could have been a result of fatal blows, the doctors told us,"" mr paithankar said. the police have picked up laxman dattkehar (38), ramesh bhagane (28), chandrakant pachal (28) and gaikwad (44) on suspicion and booked them for the murder. mr paithankar, however, said, the police had no material evidence on record even after three months of investigation.

5,"Police arrest LeT operative, say planned New Year eve strike","new delhi: the police on sunday arrested an alleged lashkar-e-taiba terrorist who was planning to carry out a bomb blast in the capital on the new year eve. the 23-year-old accused, mohammed yunus, was reportedly carrying an improvised explosive device weighing 5.5 kg at the time of his arrest. the police said they received a tip-off that a terrorist would be arriving in the capital on a bus from muzaffarnagar in uttar pradesh. a special team, led by acp l n rao and inspector raman lamba of the special cell, was set up to investigate the matter. the police mounted watch at the kashmiri gate inter state bus terminal and at about 7.20 pm spotted yunus when he alighted from a up roadways bus. a search resulted in the seizure of an ied weighing 5.5 kg. police officials said the ied comprised rdx, a detonator and a timer. the explosive also had shrapnel packed into it to intensify damage. during questioning, yunus, a resident of baghpat in up, reportedly told the police that he had recently joined let. he said that in august 2001, he had met bilal, who claimed to be the let's area commander in up, at his brother's pco shop. bilal used to frequent the pco to make calls to srinagar. it was bilal who encouraged yunus to take to terrorism. once yunus was convinced, he was sent to pakistan occupied kashmir for a basic training course. over the next 45 days yunus learnt how to handle weapons and explosives. he was later sent back to up to await further orders. yunus claims a few days back bilal phoned him and told him to come to srinagar. here bilal once again motivated yunus to join jehad and ordered him to plant explosives in delhi. he was sent to muzaffarnagar and told to meet another let terrorist who would give him the explosive device. yunus did as told and after collecting the device he boarded a bus for delhi. he was, however, arrested before he could plant the bomb. working with the description yunus has provided them, the police have sent several teams to muzaffarnagar, but have been unable to trace the let terrorist who gave yunus the bomb, so far.

6,4 former ministers find berths in new DPCC,"new delhi: after much delay, the delhi pradesh congress committee was finally constituted on monday. a considerably downsized panel with over 70 office bearers, the new dpcc has liberally accommodated all four former delhi ministers and members of the dissident factions. narendra nath, parvez hashmi, krishna tirath and yoganand shastri, who were dropped from the cabinet recently, have been rehabilitated as vice presidents in the new dpcc. while very few members of the dikshit camp have been nominated to the new dpcc, the dissident groups have found adequate representation in the panel. as compared to the previous dpcc panel, the new dpcc has been kept smaller. delhi congress president subhash chopra said this time around the number of office bearers was limited to 76. the previous dpcc had about 200 office bearers. jag parvesh chandra has been nominated as senior vice-president in the new panel. hastsal mla mukesh sharma has been appointed as the party's official spokesperson and raj chopra, a close aide of subhash chopra, has been elected the state congress treasurer. the new panel has 16 vice-presidents as compared to 13 in the last dpcc. prominent among those nominated are former mps sajjan kumar and jp aggarwal, besides legislators s c vats, brahm pal and mahabal mishra.

7,India welcomes Hafiz’s arrest,"new delhi: india expressed cautious optimism about the arrests of hafiz saeed and other terrorist leaders in pakistan, saying it would certainly be ''a step forward in the correct direction'' if true, but kept up the heat by handing over to pakistan a list of 20 specific names of persons it wanted arrested and extradited to india. the list, which contains the names of persons involved in the mumbai blasts, the ic-814 hijack and terrorist crimes in punjab and jammu and kashmir, including dawood ibrahim and maulana masood azhar, was handed over to pakistan's deputy high commissioner jalil abbas jilani in south block on monday afternoon. some of the names are of those involved in terrorist crimes in punjab and j&k and date back to more than a decade ago. sources said the list also included the names of several commanders of outfits like lashkar-e-taiba, hizb-ul mujahideen, harkat-ul-jihad-e-islami, harkat-ul-mujahedeen and khalistan liberation front and underworld dons like dawood ibrahim, tiger memon and chhota shakeel, accused of being responsible for the 1993 mumbai serial bomb blasts. external affairs minister jaswant singh said the list was of the terrorists and criminals who had taken refuge in pakistan and many of the names already had ''red-corner notices'' issued against them by interpol. ''they should be handed over to india,'' said singh. the external affairs spokesperson later told newspersons that there were international norms that made it possible in the absence of any extradition treaty. she said the information contained in the lists had also been made known to ''some of the friends in the coalition against terrorism.'' the pakistani side reportedly responded to the list by seeking specific charges and supporting evidence against the persons. responding to a question on gen musharraf's claim that the tension on the indo-pak border was making it difficult for him to take steps against terrorists, the mea spokesperson said, ''that is wholly and entirely a creation of pakistan. pakistan does not need to point fingers at others in this regard. perhaps some introspection is required on the part of pakistan.'' ''we have received information about some action taken by the pakistani authorities against jaish-e-mohammed and lashkar-e-taiba, including arrests of their leaders and raids on some of their premises...if this information is confirmed, then it is a step forward in the correct direction,'' said jaswant singh after yet another meeting of the cabinet committee on security under thechairmanship of prime minister vajpayee on monday. ''we hope that such actions against terrorist groups targeting india, including jammu and kashmir, will be pursued vigorously till cross-border terrorism is eliminated,'' he added. the mea spokesperson said it was necessary to see that pakistan take serious and sustained action and that this action be on the grounds of terrorism. the action taken against hafiz mohammed sayeed was obviously not satisfactory, she said in response to a question.

8,Snail mail still rules the roost in Lucknow,"lucknow: forget the anthrax scare that hit the nation through the postal department following september 11, or the steady march of the electronic mail and e-greetings. lucknowites are still depending on the services of the desi dakiya to wish each other this new year. and reaping the rich windfall of the new year is the postal department. in the last fortnight alone it has done brisk business. dispatching about 6.4 lakh greeting cards from the 112 post offices dotting the city, to various parts of the country and abroad. even the advent of e-greetings had failed to eat into the revenue share of the postal department ''in any big way'', chief post master sanjeev ranjan at the gpo told times news network, adding that the dispatch rate of greeting cards from the gpo premises alone was over 7,000 a day. in the past one week the number of greeting card 'packages' received by the gpo had increased substantially, with an addition of over one thousand cards a day. the sale of stamps, according to senior postal officials, has seen a 67 per cent jump at various postal outlets. this, ranjan said, had been largely due to the installation of the 'franking machine' at gpo which embosses a computerised stamp mark on all envelopes. ''the franking machine has literally been working overtime these days as the arrival of postal packages increases in festival and the new year season,'' he said. the department has also increased the number of sorting postmen at the gpo from 38 to 48, all of them now working in a 16-member batch in three shifts to take on the heavy rush. r ganeshan, chief post master general of uttar pradesh, conceding that e-greetings had picked up in some pockets of the city said that the city of nawabs, however, was largely sticking to the conventional greeting mode — through postal delivery. ''the volume of mail is very high, much because the e-mail and our service are complementary to each other,'' ganeshan said. reliable sources, however, pointed out that overseas mail had taken a beating this year and the revenue generation in this particular sector had been badly hit by the e-revolution.

9,CEE to draft report for summit on sustainable development,"ahmedabad: india's national report to the world summit on sustainable development (wssd), scheduled to be held in september 2002 at johannesburg, will be drafted by the centre for environment education (cee) for the ministry of environment and forests (moef). this city-based organisation will also hold the first in the series of national consultations which will shape india's view point at the global summit. talking to tnn, cee director kartikeya sarabhai said on monday, ""cee had drafted the national report submitted to the united nations conference on environment and development (unced), held at rio de janeiro, brazil, in june 1992. we have been approached by the moef for preparing india's inputs for the wssd."" however, this time the inputs will reflect the people's perspective and not just the government's. ""we will hold consultations which will have participation of even common citizens, and reflect their concerns,"" he added. moreover, cee will also share india's examples of success with the world, which will reflect the various issues related to environment and development. tracing back the contribution of ahmedabad in environmental and developmental issues, sarabhai said, ""some 70 years ago, mahatma gandhi had made a very important statement from ahmedabad on development. he had said if an entire nation of 300 million (now 100 million) took to similar economic exploitation (as the developed west), it would strip the world bare like locusts."" talking about the forthcoming summit, he said, ""in 1972, a un conference on environment was held at stockholm. twenty years later at rio, the subject was environment and development. and now in 2002, the focus has shifted to sustainable development - an issue which was taken up at stockholm by indira gandhi, who pressed for including the angle of poverty in the debate."" he said many countries are looking up to india for playing a crucial role at rio as it has the strength of a strong bureaucracy and governance, which can perceive the designs of their counterparts in stronger countries, and if need be, resist them. this was proved when other countries were forcing india to accept curbs on exploitation of forests, but turned out to be unsuccessful. ""in the wssd, focus will be laid also on implementation of the agenda-21, which was agreed upon by all the participating countries for voluntary implementation but has never been implemented. even india did not follow the formal agenda, though it did many things in the spirit of rio,"" he said. it may be noted that it was not economic affairs or issues of safety and security that brought the largest number of the heads of the states on one platform. it was the 1992 rio summit that saw largest assembly of the world leaders over any issue. cee enjoys a place of pride for being an autonomous body to have drafted the report for the global summit. sarabhai and cee programme co-ordinator meena raghunathan had drafted the report. on wednesday, it will host the western region multi-stakeholder consultative workshop on issues pertaining to water, industrial pollution and its control, and also on disaster preparedness and management, which will be india's inputs. the workshop is open for all.

10,Tax holiday fails to draw investments to Kutch,"gandhinagar: the gujarat government's claim that the combined sales tax and excise incentives announced for kutch to attract incentives would mean a 20 to 26 per cent benefit is failing to make any dent with big and medium industries to set up production units in the quake-hit district. though the sales tax incentives were announced on november 9, 2001, to supplement the excise incentives, put out on july 31, 2001, top officials concede, so far they have not received any proposal for investment beyond rs 22 crore. ""the state industries commission received as many as 230 inquiries,"" said a senior government official. ""it sent across a proforma to each one of them to find out the concrete nature of plans. though there is some movement after the sales tax incentives were announced, only 40 have replied back with a positive note since november 2001. out of these, a mere 16 have gone ahead with implementing their proposals by acquiring land."" giving details here on monday, the senior official said, ""most of the projects for which land was acquired range between rs 2 crore and rs 5 crore. there is only one project with an investment of rs 22 crore, by a delhi-based party. none of them are important names, in any case. this at a time when only those industries with more than rs 50 crore investment can really stand to gain from the two incentives in the long run."" reasoning out the poor response from big and medium industries, the official insisted, ""the period of two years to start production to avail excise incentives is considered to be too short to get elementary permissions such as those related with environment and land acquisition, not to start production units, the main requirement to avail of the advantage. only small units, under such circumstances, can hope to make a dent. they require smaller land and few clearances."" a confederation of indian industries official says, as many as 111 companies, big and medium, had asked for details on incentives. ""after getting the replies, none showed any interest to invest in kutch. the reasons are various. the markets are down. labour and power sector reforms are just not taking off to enthuse new hope among investors to go to kutch. there is a huge exclusion list. even the automobile industry cannot invest in the district."" ""even the sales tax incentives has a bleak future. one is not sure what will happen to it after the state goes in for value-added tax to replace sales tax from april 2002, drastically reducing the level of tax burden at source because of the formula on giving set off at every input. then, there is little development of infrastructure in kutch to attract investors. the power and water situation is grim. profit margins are bound to be low,"" the official said. opines gujarat institute of development research director sudarshan iyengar, ""the central and state governments have wished to unnecessarily hurry up with attracting investment in kutch, which has traditionally failed to attract the industry. to close all incentives within two or three years is not a good policy. the 1812 kutch quake, of the same scale, shows aftershocks, often serious ones, continue for two years. the tectonic plates seem to take a longer time to settle. the industry may like to wait and watch before investing."" an economist, prof iyengar says, ""the kandla-gandhidham-adipur-anjar is the only belt in the huge expanses of kutch that has seen some commercial activity. yet, requests by the local chambers of commerce and industry to give tax holiday and rescheduling of loans borrowed for economic activity to union finance minister yashwant sinha was brushed aside. then, mineral-based industries do not come up because of environmental concerns. the free-trade zone, set up in 1960s near kandla, failed to pick up."" except shipping at kandla and mundra, both for hard and liquid cargo, including oil, possibilities of other activities have remained dormant. yet another concern is of water. officials say, those investing in kutch can set up their own desalination plants, costing at least rs 25 lakh. disagrees prof iyengar, ""groundwater exploitation at kandla has created problems for anjar's rural areas. with no permanent source of water available in kutch, there is little hope for the industry."" officials privately admit, they cannot promise narmada waters to kutch despite announcements.

13,"Dharwad's year of intrigues, riots and suicides","hubli: the dharwad district congress has at least lived up to the party's ``tradition'' of dissidence: the parallel rallies (after tehelka) held in hubli and dharwad in april brought into open the rift in the local congress. and, this coincided with the tehelka-like koujalgi tape episode in belgaum. following this in may, the faction close to one of the most powerful congress leaders from the region, h k patil, and his close ally, labour minister a.m. hindasgeri, were totally sidelined during the hdmc elections. the two ministers could not even get party tickets for even five of their followers. the sidelining was complete when firdous konnur was elected hdmc mayor. in the organisational elections also, the foursome mla group gained upper hand and jabbar khan honalli became the city congress president. the district (rural) committee president's post could not be filled up with the ministers ``exerting pressure'' not to appoint prakash ullagaddimath. till then, dissidence was limited to demand for hindasgeri's removal from the cabinet by the four elected congress mlas of the district citing ``non-performance'', supported by youth congress leader prakash ullagaddimath and the present kpcc member veeranna mattigatti. in fact, the first salvo was fired against hindasgeri by jabbarkhan honalli during the anjuman elections. hindasgeri's group was routed. now the criticism by the opposition is that developmental activities in the district, especially in the twin cities, have come to a standstill with factionalism in the congress taking a lead. it was expected that when hdmc went to the congress and the same party in vidhan soudha, the twin cities would be placed on the fast track to development. alas, that did not happen. as far as law and order problem is concerned, the year was one of the worst hit. there were at least two major communal riots. the recent one that erupted during the birthday celebrations of vhp chief ashok singhal witnessed police firing and death of two persons. as a fallout, police commissioner y.r. patil was shunted out and kuchanna srinivas brought in from hal. police records reveal at least 14 stabbing incidents, all related to the communal nature of hubli. these were topped by nature's fury also. drought hit the region and dharwad bore the brunt. agitations forced the government to start relief work and chief minister s.m. krishna visited the region, but not dharwad district. farmers are still in a pathetic condition, for relief work not is reaching them, though the official claim has achieved the target. what really blew the lid off is the suicides of farmers in the region. when the first suicide was reported from navalur, former prime minister deve gowda came visiting, kicking off more visits by politicians to the village. the government came up with a compensation package of rs 1 lakh to the bereaved family. after two compensations, the government decreed that magisterial enquiry ratifying the genuineness was a prerequisite for claiming solatium. however, the government's intervention in the market following the price crash was appreciated, with the government procuring onion, maize and potato. what happened for the procured items is a different story. the year ended with one of the most prestigious cooperative banks in the region being superseded by the state government, the karnataka credit cooperative bank, coming into bankruptcy with crores of rupees being ``swindled'' forcing the employees to agitate. the irony is that one of the main reasons for the bank to suffer was many of the cooperative units not paying the outstanding amount running into rs 61 crore while the backlog from farmers is rs 250 crore. the riddle: why did congress strongman h k patil, groomed in co-operative philosophy, remain silent during the controversy?
