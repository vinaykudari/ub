2,Kiran's parents accuse her in-laws of harassment,"KANPUR: Controversy is being raked over the death of Kiran, daughter of Radha Krishna. She died while being brought back to the Sri Ram Hospital after the Hallet Hospital refused to admit her.

Adding a new twist to the controversy, her family members have accused her husband Girish and his family of harassment for dowry.

Kiran had delivered a pre-matured baby girl on June 11 at the Sri Ram (SR)Hospital. As the condition of the premature baby was deteriorating she was rushed to the Hallet hospital on the advise of doctors.

Later, doctors recommended that Kiran too be shifted to the Hallet Hosptial.

However, the Hallet administration refused to entertain her and she was sent back to the SR hospital where she was declared dead by Dr Madhu Bajpai on Friday evening.

Kiranâ€™s parents informed reporters that even after four-years of marriage she was never allowed to visit their house. Krishna claimed that Girish frequently called at their house to demand Rs 1 lakh as dowry.

However, her father-in-law Munne Lal Sabita rubbishes the claim and says that Kiran died due to weak and unstable condition.

The death certificate issued by the SR Hospital clearly cites weakness as the reason of death.Her father claimed that they were not even informed about the critical condition of their daughter.

They were in fact informed about her by neighbours. The matter has been reported with the Babupurwa police station.

3,Shettys sought help from ex-minister to recover dues,"AHMEDABAD: Film actress Shilpa Shetty''s father, Surendra Shetty, has acknowledged during his interrogation being done by the Surat police in the Prafful Sarees extortion case, that he first contacted BJP MLAs Purushottam Solanki and his brother Hirabhai Solanki to recover the dues from Prafful Sarees owner Pankaj Aggarwal for the ad film in which Shilpa had been featured.

The negotiations with Agrawal are said to have been done by Hirabhai. Police officials said it was only after Solanki, a former BJP minister who is also a former TADA detainee, failed to deliver the goods that Shetty got in touch with Malaysia-based gangster Fazl-ur-Rehman, whose associates allegedly made extortion calls on Aggarwal.

Said a senior police official, ""Shetty established contacts with Solanki through his driver Dilip"". Apparently, Dilip is ""well-connected"" in Mumbai.

Talking to the TNN, Shetty, however, denied news reports that he had established contact with Rehman''s associates to recover his money. ""I was talking to them over phone because they posed as men of Pankaj Aggarwal,"" Shetty said, before leaving for Mumbai on Saturday.

Shetty''s lawyer, S V Raju termed the reports as false and said ""my client never admitted at any time during the interrogation or to any other persons that he had talked to the mafia.""

4,Jamat slams anti-conversion laws,"HYDERABAD: Reacting strongly to anti-conversion laws enacted by a few states, chief of Jamat-e-Islami Hind Abdul Haq Ansari on Saturday asserted that the Jamat would continue to attract oppressed sections of other religions towards Islam.

â€œLaws cannot prevent people from converting on their own, in a democracy like India,â€� he said.

Ansari said it was very unfortunate that some of the democratically elected governments were trying to curb the right to chose oneâ€™s religion. The Jamat would also spread the message of Islam to all sections of the society, he added.

State Congress general secretary Manas Bhuinya alleged on Saturday that the children in Lalgola and Jangipur blocks of Murshidabad had died owing to the state health departmentâ€™s negligence.

â€œThe situation is rapidly going out of control. It has created panic among villagers, who have started fleeing their homes out of fear,â€� claimed Bhuinya.

7,Day-long power cut sparks angry protest,"KOLKATA: Over 700 people living in a bustee at 68, Elliot Road, endured a day-long power cut before taking to the streets in protest on Saturday evening. Traffic was stalled from 9.30 pm to 10 pm after enraged residents blocked the road.

The angry mob of around 600 men, women and children laid seige on a CESC vehicle that was passing through the area.

Local resident Tarun Das said the power cut occured around 6 am on Saturday after a cable burst in a building adjoining the bustee. â€œIn the morning, complaints were made and then people went out to work. Tempers began to flare when people arrived in the evening to find that the fault had not been repaired. Matters came to a head when locals spotted a CESC vehicle passing through the area. Residents gheraoed it and demanded immediate power supply,â€� Das said.

Though several telephone calls were made to the CESC fault reporting cell, no inspection or repair team reached the area till 11.30 pm. It was only around midnight that a team from the power utility finally arrived after SOS telephone calls from the police.

â€œEverytime a call was made, CESC officials said a team was on its way. It is evident that they were lying. Had it not been a bustee, they wouldnâ€™t have dared to be so complacent,â€� resident Asif Rahim said.

Constables from the Park Street police station, who were present at the troubled spot, were also furious with the power utility for failing to address the fault.

â€œWhat was a power failure was fast developing into a law and order problem due to CESCâ€™s inaction. Had the repair team delayed any further, the situation could easily have gone out of hand,â€� a constable posted in the area said.

8,Jail probe refutes clash theory,"KOLKATA: Preliminary inquiries by the Presidency jail and state prison directorate officials indicate that Lal Bahadur Rai, an undertrial prisoner who died in the jail on Friday, had fallen while taking a bath and was injured in the back of his head.

â€œThe DIG has visited the jail and carried out a probe which revealed that the prisoner died after falling inside the bathroom,â€� IG (prison) Jaidev Chakraborty said on Saturday. According to a senior jail official, the postmortem report corroborated this.

West Bengal Human Rights Commission chairman Justice (retd) Mukul Gopal Mukhopadhyay said that he had noted the incident and the commission would take a decision on carrying out an investigation on Monday.

Meanwhile, the jail was abuzz with rumours that Rai, 22, awaiting trial for a theft, had been injured in a clash between two groups of inmates at lunch time. It was alleged that the clash broke out when one group broke the food queue and the other protested.

Lal Bahadurâ€™s father Ram Chandra Rai had complained about negligence on part of the jail staff, said an official. However, jail officials denied both allegations.

â€œWe know there are groupings among prisoners, but we keep them separate and take care that they do not clash with one another. Otherwise, you would hear of clashes in the jail every day,â€� said one of them. Moreover, officials claimed, Rai was not even a part of any such group. â€œHe was a petty thief and a drug addict. He had come to the jail only a couple of days ago,â€� they pointed out.

While conceding that old inmates often tried to extort new entrants in jail and beat them unless their family members pay up, the officials rejected such a possibility in Raiâ€™s case. â€œHe had come from such a poor financial background that one could easily see that there was no chance of getting anything from him,â€� they argued.

9,BJP protests against Gaikwad's transfer,"PUNE: Nearly 100 BJP workers, led by corporators Anil Shirole and Vikas Matkari, staged a demonstration outside the Jain hostel in Model Colony where chief minister Sushilkumar Shinde attended a programme on Saturday.

They were protesting against the abrupt transfer of commissioner of cooperatives, Ratnakar Gaikwad.

The BJP men alleged that the decision to transfer Gaikwad was taken under pressure, and said that it was wrong to transfer an honest officer who was doing his job well.

They said this was not the first time a forthright officer had been transferred, as Shinde had failed to take proper decisions.

The protestors accused the chief minister of turning back on his promise regarding Gaikwad, made just 24 hours before he was transferred.

Later, a BJP delegation submitted a memorandum to Shinde, who is believed to have told it that he understood their feelings in the matter.

The protest was held amid heavy police presence.

The police had cordoned off the area, erecting barricades and diverting traffic to routes other than Shinde''s.

10,Police arrest quack in Mandi Gobindgarh,"PATIALA: The arrest of an alleged quack dental surgeon at Mandi Gobindgarh by the police goes against the claims of Punjab health department that there is no quack in the entire state.

Taking serious note of the high court''s verdict few years ago, the administration had swung into action and a large number of the so-called registered medical practitioners were nabbed.

In this case, police arrested Jeet Singh for impersonating as a BDS doctor and running his business for around three decades in this industrial town. Source said the health department authorities had raided his shop recently and seized fake documents but he was allowed to go scot-free.

Civil surgeons, as such, have no authority to check quacks or sale of intoxicants being sold openly at the drug stores. This work is done only by drug inspectors but their performance can be well adjudged from the presence of a large number of shops of quacks in each area of towns and villages of the state.

Dr OPS Kande, former president of the Punjab unit of the Indian Medical Council, while talking to TNN here on Sunday, said that Punjab Medical Council registered only those practitioners who were well qualified but there were still thousands of quacks openly practising impersonating as registered medical practitioners.

He urged the Punjab and Haryana High Court to direct the Punjab government to launch a special campaign to identify quacks and take appropriate action against them. He said that these quacks were also working as the agents of private hospitals and nursing homes, which was against the ethics of medical profession.

11,SNDP yet to decide on forming political front,"KANNUR: The Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana council has not yet taken a decision to set up a political formation in the state but had only discussed ways and means to realise its slogan of empowering the deprived and backward class, its president C K Vidyasagar said on Sunday.

The SNDP''s objective to ensure a vote to a candidate representing the backward community was just a continuation of its slogan of ''empowerment of the deprived'' and the Yogam''s stand could later culminate into a possible formation of a new front in Kerala politics, he told reporters here.
