0,Notice to govt on Arjuna awards,"new delhi: the delhi high court has issued notices to the union government and the sports authority of india on a petition challenging the government's policy on the arjuna awards, which are given to outstanding sportspersons. justice mukul mudgal, however, declined to stay the arjuna awards function, to be held on wednesday, in view of its importance and asked the petitioner to not to press for it any further. the petitioner, a leading asian discus thrower anil kumar, in his writ raised the issues of policy on this prestigious national award in sports, selection of sportspersons for this honour and laying down of proper guidelines. the court also appointed senior advocate amrender sharan as amicus curiae (lawyer to assist the court) to represent kumar who had been arguing his case himself. assisting the court, sharan said the stay on the awards ceremony cannot be granted at this stage but the writ could be amended by adding a prayer for laying down proper guidelines for selection of sportspersons for arjuna and other national awards. the petitioner objected to selection of a sai official rachna govil for the award, alleging the selection process is being manipulated and awards are doled out to undeserving persons. when court asked under which rule a sai official was being considered for the arjuna award, the government counsel upamanyu hazarika said, ``she is being given the award for her lifetime achievement in promotion of sports.'' not satisfied with the counsel's reply, the court said government should clarify in the affidavit whether a sports administrator could be considered for the award. in his petition kumar has contended, ``the national award policy of the government is vague, incomprehensive, inadequate, and is being manipulated by sports officials with malafide intention, nepotism and favouritism.'' ``as a result the awards are being doled out to totally undeserving persons, who are hardly near me in performance,'' he alleged. stating that his name had not been considered for the past three years for the arjuna award, kumar said, ``i may be permanently left out of the award, or may have to wait for 40 years like milkha singh.'' kumar claimed the list of sportspersons drawn by the department of youth affairs and sports for consideration this year had many names which do not figure even among the top 100 athletes in the country.

2,Leaders say no to MCD polls,"new delhi: senior bjp leaders seem to be in no mood to contest the corporation polls early next year. those refusing to contest polls include chairman standing committee prithviraj sawhney, leader of the house mahesh chander sharma and mayor shanti desai. interestingly, the `i-will-not-contest' bug has bitten leader of the opposition ram babu sharma also. all these politicians give different reasons for shying from the elections. but the most significant reason, it seems, is the uncertainty caused by the rotation system. not only the councillors but even the party leaders are in a spin because of the rotation of seats. desai is a councillor from chandni chowk, which has now been reserved for a woman scheduled caste candidate. sawhney's janakpuri seat will also have a woman sc candidate while mahesh chander sharma's seat has been reserved for a woman candidate. congress leader sharma's seat will see a sc candidate. sawhney said: ``i have no intentions to contest the polls and also do not harbour any plans to nurture a constituency. the same holds true for the mayor also, who wants to retire from active politics. in fact, i feel that politicians over 60 years should not contest elections at all. there are so many other things to do ^ like working for the party and guiding our younger politicians.'' after some prodding, sawhney says: ``well, if the party forces me to contest, i might. but you see, people need to work for the party also. and it is the party whose interest is paramount, not an individual's.'' he adds the system of rotation has bred uncertainty in the minds of all the councillors. the leader of the house is equally evasive. sharma says: ``i will not fight the polls. the party will decide my candidature. i will work for the party and the sangathan. and because of the polls, we will have lot of new faces in the bjp. i would like to train them in the art of politics.'' sharma says: ``i am from the grassroots. so how do you expect me to leave my constituency and contest polls from another place. i know that many councillors are eying other seats. but i am not doing so. i still go to my ward every day and meet the constituents for two hours. later during the day, i meet the officials also.'' finally, the portly ram babu sharma of the congress says: ``i will let the party decide. but we are very clear, we want the rotation system to be wound up. let the people vote on the basis of the councillor's work and interest in the constituency. the present system of holding elections causes the candidates to lose interest and also presents an uncertain future.''

5,Munde warns DF govt. over drought in state,"mumbai: former deputy chief minister gopinath munde has warned that ministers of the democratic front (df) government will not be allowed to enter marathwada if immediate steps are not taken to tackle the drought in the region. incidentally, chief minister vilasrao deshmukh belongs to this area. mr munde is currently on a tour of the state to assess the drought situation. he told this newspaper that farmers and cattle were facing a harrowing situation because of the drought, which has affected not only marathwada but certain districts in other regions as well. mr munde was part of a delegation that called on prime minister atal behari vajpayee in delhi recently to apprise him of the drought situation. mr vajpayee announced a grant of rs 100 crore in response to the delegation's demand. earlier this week, mr munde addressed a large rally at aurangabad where he first issued the warning that no minister would be permitted to set foot in the region if recovery of bank loans and governmental levies on farmers were not suspended. mr munde's supporters chose aurangabad deliberately to exhibit his clout over the region in which the bjp's ally, the shiv sena, has a formidable presence. after the recent cold war between the two saffron partners, mr munde has been mobilising people of the region on the issue of drought. last week, mr munde had held a huge rally at beed, his home district. at that time, too, the sena was kept away. ""we want the sena to know that we are ready to work alone,"" a local bjp functionary said. the aurangabad rally pleased bjp strategists immensely. opposition leader nitin gadkari, maharashtra bjp president pandurang phundkar and the party's general secretary sharad kulkarni accompanied mr munde to aurangabad to ensure that no stone was left unturned. the turnout, despite rains in some pockets, was more than expected, according to bjp sources. mr munde, however, has taken care not to antagonise the sena by words or deeds. for instance, the bjp's aurangabad unit was asked to vote for sena candidates for local self-government and legislative council elections. mr munde has demanded the setting of a cabinet sub-committee to monitor the drought situation. he said the entire marathwada region should be declared drought-hit without wasting any more time. similarly, criteria for starting employment guarantee scheme works needed to be revised in view of the grim situation.

6,"CPM defends arrest, Opp. calls it vendetta","kolkata: both the trinamul congress and the party for democratic socialism have reacted strongly against the arrest of former dum dum municipality chairman sudhir bhattacharya on charge of the murder of his successor sailen das. on the other hand cpm state secretary anil biswas defended the arrest of bhattacharya stating that: ""police must have obtained concrete information about bhattacharya's involvement in the crime. the police are to confirm whether he had indulged in criminal activities or not,'' biswas said. bhattacharya, who had severed ties with the cpm in seventies, formed another marxist party. despite being hemmed in by the cpm, he managed to reign in dum dum municipality for more than 30 years. he was unseated by das only two years ago. by that time, he was accused of favouring promoters including his son who were part of the mushrooming construction business. lately, he was known to be close to the controversial cpm minister subhas chakroborty when latter was on the verge of leaving the party before the assembly poll. while pds leader samir putatunda alleged that bhattacharya had been framed at the instance of an influential zonal committee member of the cpm of dum dum, trinamul policy making committee chairman pankaj banerjee branded it as an evidence of political vendetta of the cpm against his party. ""the arrest of sudhir bhattacharya is unfortunate. it is a disgraceful incident of political vendetta. it is also an indication for the opposition to surrender before the ruling party. such a thing is unacceptable in a democratic set up,"" said banerjee. the cpm was hell bent on persecuting those who had defied the party diktat and also deserted the front, he said. bhattacharya was keen to contest the elections this time on a trinamul ticket and that he was framed as a consequence of this. banerjee said that bhattacharya was also instrumental in the cpm's defeat in dum dum in the last assembly elections. the seat was won by trinamul candidate arunabha ghosh who defeated cpm nominee ajit choudhury. both banerjee and putatunda said no one should be arrested on the basis of the confession of an arrested person. ""on the very day of the murder of sailen das, cpm zonal committee secretary bapi gupta had said that bhattacharya had a hand behind the incidnet. this is significant,"" putatunda said. he blamed inner-party feuds within the cpm for das' murder. ""it was a dispute between promoters and row over contractors' getting order for supplies which led to the killing."" according to him, the same inner-party disputes led to the murder. ""why have ghosh's killers not been arrested? after the killing, ghosh's family members did not allow any of the cpm leaders to come anywhere near his body,"" putatunda said. according to the former cpm leader, a number of cpm activists had become involved in building construction and supply of materials. ""in 1995, we had taken a resolution in the south 24 parganas district committee of the cpm that no party member should be involved in such activities, but the same resolution could not be made effective for the party in the entire state."" biswas ruled out a probe into some cpm supporters' role in this murder. after the murder, both biswas and chief minister buddhadeb bhattacharjee did not blame the opposition parties but hinted at the nexus between the politicians and realtors inside the party. however, bhattacharya's arrrest seemed to have changed the cpm leaderships's mood.

7,Rains bring hope for farmers in Warangal,"warangal: khariff crops in general and dry crops in particular saw a ray of hope in north telangana districts after the incessant rains.the two-day rains have given the farmer ample time to think over the sowing and reaping of short term dry crops in the region. warangal district as per the records of the agricultural department has received about 2.5 cm rainfall during the current rains. this enabled the farmers of the upland region to take to the dry crops, while the mulugu and parakal area farmers have resumed their paddy transplantations after the present phase inflows into the major tanks. the coverage averages of ground nut crop in khammam district which usually cross the 25 thousand hectares every year could not be reached in the early stages of this year. similarly, in warangal the coverage extent was 76 t h o u s a n d hectares during the khariff season. but both these districts could not fare well in the coverage extent at the beginning of the season and only a half of the average extent was covered in these districts. particularly in the jangaon area of warangal district, the coverage of groundnut crop was reduced to minimum at the starting of the season. but the delayed on set of monsoon is helping the farm sector of this region to cover up the lost ground. venkat rajaiah of govardhanagiri village said farmers are now paying their attention towards sowing of groundnut crop. we could have opted for maize also, but the rate index of last year has prompted us to take to ground nut, which is providing us some sort of helpful rates at the market, he said. though the delayed onset of monsoons is likely to help the cotton farmer to some extent, the farmer relying on the pulses, turmeric and chilly are forced to face the hardships this season. in the huzurabad region of karimnagar district, farmers are now turning towards a contingency khariff plan by sowing the short term crops like green gram and red gram in selective places. as per the paddy transplantation, the coverage extent now may be increased with the recent rainsin the district. faint hope farmers thinking of going for short-term dry crops2.5 cm rainfall recorded in warangal this seasoncoverage of groundnut crop reduced to the minimumfarmers covering lost ground.

12,IIM 'incubator' to hatch hi-tech projects,"ahmedabad: at a time when innovation is the only surviving catalyst in a slow-moving world economy, the indian institute of management-ahmedabad has set up an 'incubator' to promote innovators of high-end technology. launched last month , the centre for innovation and incubation will identify potential projects in cutting-edge engineering, biotechnology and pharmaceuticals and turn, what they consider, good ideas into commercial ventures. the state government has already committed rs 1.28 crore for the project for capital expenditure, while the rest of the cost will be borne by the institute and its network partners like the gujarat venture finance limited (gvfl), national institute of design, centre for scientific and industrial research, space application centre and physical research laboratories. ""although the centre will be set up on our new campus, we will scout for talent across the country,"" institute professor dr devnath tirupati said. ""we don't want to restrict ourselves geographically."" also, a mere good business plan will not be enough. it will have to involve innovation in one of the high-end technologies to be considered for the project. eventually, they will have room for six innovators spending about three years at the centre. gvfl managing director vishnu varshney, who has been invited to be on the board of the centre, is optimistic about the project. ""they have the academic knowledge and we have the practical experience in supporting start-ups,"" varshney said. ""in fact, we have experience in helping companies right from the stage of conception when most other venture capitalists like to provide only growth capital once the company has settled down. it is about time iim-a came up with a project like this."" gvfl is looking at the project to identify good funding opportunities as well. and there is no shortage of such innovators, according to tirupathi. three years back, about 50 innovators had attended a workshop at the institute, as a first step of setting up the centre. ""we realised then that there was no shortage of ideas in the country. what was missing was a support system,"" he said. ""we were surprised to find that innovators were in fact being discouraged. the scientific community felt they were compromising academic integrity by wanting to go commercial, which obviously does not make sense in today's world."" with the network of partners in place, an innovator will have access to some of the best laboratories and experts apart from the iim-a faculty. ""many of the ideas are technologically very sound but fail because they don't have a sound business plan. we hope to fill this gap."" for the project, tirupati hopes to use his 12 years of experience with the university of texas, austin, which also has an incubator since 1987. ""i have seen that such projects not only help innovators, but will also help the students of the institute, who can help design the business plans. many of them may be hoping of becoming innovators themselves. such projects can be a first step.""

13,Surat textile markets observe bandh,"surat: all the shops and trading houses in textile markets in the city remained closed on friday in response to a bandh call given by the federation of surat textile traders association (fstta) following death of a businessman _ by cardiac arrest _ in ratan market allegedly due to excessive harassment by the corporation's octroi officials on thursday. according to fstta president tarachand kasat, the octroi officials of the surat municipal corporation (smc) had unnecessarily forced the businessman, purushottam arora (51), to pay octroi charges for the goods he had brought to his shop from bhiwandi in mumbai. as per the rule, the smc has a fixed structure of octroi to be paid periodically on the goods brought from outside. since arora had stopped bringing the raw fabrics from mumbai and accordingly, he had informed the smc officials in writing about the same, the corporation officials, however, forcibly inspected his shop and asked him to prove that the goods kept there had not been brought from mumbai, one office-bearer of the federation said. despite repeated claims that the goods were not from outside, the smc officials remained adamant on their stand and asked for payment of octroi charges, which was a huge amount, sources in fstta informed. arora could not withstand this and suffered a massive cardiac arrest and subsequently he died in the shop, south gujarat texturisers association s s yadav said. hearing the news of his death, panic gripped the whole textile markets in the city on thursday evening, as many of them took the inspection as from the central excise department. soon a meeting was convened and it was resolved that all the shops would remain closed on friday, firstly as a mark of respect to the departed soul and also in protest against the highhandedness of the revenue officials, according to yadav. it may be noted here that for the last few days, the central excise department has been on an intensive combing spree in the city, causing worry to many in the trade circles. hence, the incident in ratan market on thursday was mistaken by many there, as the raids by the excise department were being conducted randomly, according to sources in the textile markets. as part of solidarity among the business community, the funeral procession of arora was marked by a huge gathering on friday morning. later during the day, office-bearers of fstta and other associations jointly held a meeting near ratan market and it was resolved that a memorandum be submitted to the corporation chief to restrain the octroi officials from such behaviour.

15,"Call all-party meet on SYL, says Brar","chandigarh: senior vice-president of punjab pcc jagmeet brar has demanded that chief minister parkash singh badal call an all-party meeting on the on-going crisis on sharing of river waters. talking to mediapersons here on friday, brar, who represents faridkot constituency in the lok sabha, said if badal failed to do so within a week, the congress would take the initiative for this because a serious crisis could soon grip the state unless all-party consensus to protect its interests is evolved. he regretted that the chief minister had so far called no meeting of either the legislative members or the lok sabha members from the state to deliberate on the matter. as the supreme court has made it binding on punjab and haryana to resolve the contentious issue by the end of this month, he said political leaders should stop blaming one another for past mistakes and instead evolve a concerted strategy to safeguard the interests of the state's farmers. he said the earlier awards on the sharing of ravi-beas waters with haryana and rajasthan, provided by the centre in 1955, 1976 and 1981, were discriminatory and punjab's interests as a riparian state were not taken care of. if the congress leaders erred in the past, the chief minister, during his earlier tenure in 1978, signed the notification on the construction of the sutlej-yamuna link canal, which subsequently became a bone of contention between the two states. while asserting the state did not have any water to spare for its neighbours, he said if haryana and rajasthan must get their share of ravi-beas water, punjab also should be allotted its share from the yamuna, on the same principle, which comes to about 2.28 maf. the congress leader regretted that the matter could not be discussed in the state vidhan sabha where a consensus could have been evolved for exerting pressure on the centre in the interest of the state. commenting on the river water dispute bill, 2001, passed by the lok sabha early this month, brar said he, along with other congress mps from the state, opposed the bill whereas shiromani akali dal mps did not protest. now with the bill slated to be tabled in the rajya sabha, he wanted sad mps to oppose it. he admitted that the congress, as a national party, would not be able to stall the passing of the bill despite the punjab pcc's stance against it.

18,Gehlot protests to Badal on river water issue,"jaipur: rajasthan chief minister ashok gehlot has protested to his punjab counterpart parkash singh badal over the latter's reported statement that the state would not part with any water from three rivers. ""i have lodged a formal protest with badal on his statement by writing a letter to him yesterday,"" he said. badal had announced in the assembly that punjab would not part even with a drop of ravi, beas and sutlej rivers. gehlot said refusal to part with water from these three rivers would be against the provisions of inter-state water sharing agreement. the agreement cannot be violated by punjab because the control of bhakhra and pong dam were vested with bhakhra management board under the union government, he pointed out. rajasthan had been getting waters of ravi and beas rivers since 1920 under an agreement between the then bikaner state and british empire. later, the desert state received monopoly right over ravi, beas and sutlej rivers under indus water treaty in 1960.

30,BJP leader flays minister over remark,"bellary: the bellary district bjp president g.karunakara reddy criticised the minister of state for rural development and panchayat raj m.diwakar babu for his recent statements about the scarcity fund. reddy said that without going into the actual facts and figures, diwakar babu had said that the center had not released enough money for the scarcity fund and food grains for karnataka. reddy said, the minister must apprise himself of the situation before making such statements. reddy refuted the charges of the minister that the karnataka government did not receive any grains from the central government despite being assured of one lakh tonnes. reddy said, this allegation is totally false and baseless. ``let the minister cross check the departments'', he added. reddy said, bellary district had received the second highest amount of food grains after gulbarga district in karnataka. he said, the district had received 4,650 metric tones of rice, 4,150 metric tones of wheat and 8,800 metric tones of foodgrains. reddy added, all the districts in karnataka had received food grains from the centre to cope with the drought. he said, 7,000 metric tones had been released for bijapur district, 6,620 metric tones for tumkur district and 5,570 metric tonnes of grains for raichur district. reddy said, karnataka had received rs 29 crore towards the drought relief fund. besides this, reddy added, the central government had assured another rs 20 crore to karnataka when chief minister krishna met prime minister vajpayee at an all party meet recently. the centre had also assured two tonnes of fodder for the cattle, he added. he said, the centre had asked the karnataka government to sent estimates of fodder requirement for each district in karnataka so that the centre could transport the fodder to the districts directly. ``when the district is reeling under drought, the people are suffering and the cattle are dying due to non-availability of fodder, babu has taken a backseat and is blaming the centre for its inability to handle the drought. what is more astonishing is that he is so busy criticising the centre that he has forgotten to visit the drought-affected areas.'' when he was criticised by the public and the opposition leaders, he visited just a few villages and declared that the scarcity works in the affected villages were being taken up, reddy said. though the cm himself inaugurated these works, the scarcity works have been stalled in these villages. ``let the karnataka government implement the scarcity works effectively in the affected villages. till then, babu has no right to point a finger at the central government'', reddy added. raichur prevent migration: the vice-president of janata dal (united), karnataka unit lakshmikantamma on tuesday appealed to the karnataka chief minister krishna to prevent the migration of agriculturists and provide employment to them. the cm was on a visit to drought-affected villages recently. in her memorandum addressed to the cm, lakshmikantamma narrated the plight of farmers in drought-hit raichur. she said, sufficient funds must be released to tackle the drought. raichur district must be declared a drought-affected area, she added.
