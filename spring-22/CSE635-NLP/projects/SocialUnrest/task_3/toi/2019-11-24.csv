1,Private-public partnership policy in December,"KOLKATA: The West Bengal government will come out with a policy guideline next month on private-public partnership (PPP) to bring uniformity in such tie-ups in the basic infrastructure sectors and to ensure transparency and competitiveness in such deals.

â€œThe policy guideline on PPP will be announced in December.We are presently in the process of fine-tuning the draft,â€� state urban development and municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya told reporters after addressing an international workshop on â€˜Private Participation in Infrastructureâ€™ here.

While private participation has been successful in areas like housing and commercial complex construction in West Bengal, the same cannot be said for other infrastructural facilities like roads and bridges, the minister said.

He said models like build-operate-transfer were not always suitable for such projects and variants of PPP such as municipal bonds, tradeable development rights and use of land as a resource needed to be explored.

Earlier inaugurating the workshop, Bhattacharya, also the chairman of the Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority (KMDA), said while states like Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Maharashtra have resorted to PPP in a limited way, West Bengal would aspire to get more PPP in the areas of basic infrastructure for the common people.

Minimisation of financial risks was crucial for successful implementation of PPP, he said, pointing out that willingness of beneficiaries to pay for acceptable standards of services was gaining ground.

2,Coalition politics: Challenge for presiding officers,"PATNA: Speakers at a seminar on the â€œrole of presiding officers in the coalition governmentâ€� stressed on the impartial and unbiased role of the presiding officers of the legislature to retain the dignity of parliamentary democracy. The seminar had been organised by the state chapter of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Union on Saturday in the annexe building of the state assembly here. The concern of the speakers was that due to coalition politics, the image of the presiding officers had started waning, and had to be restored.

Speaker of the UP assembly Keshri Nath Tripathi, who gave the key-note address on the occasion, stated that in the wake of coalition politics, a visible change had occurred in the principles followed by presiding officers, setting a wrong precedent.

He said that big parties had started giving the post of presiding officer to the leaders of small parties for keeping in tact their seat of power. This had vitiated the system, he said, adding that it had necessitated improving the environment in right perspective. He said presiding officers should give suitable opportunities to the opposition parties during deliberations in the legislature, and the House should reflect on peopleâ€™s aspirations in true spirit.

Bihar assembly Speaker Sadanand Singh said that due to fast changing political scene, the pressure on the presiding officers had increased. They have to work under adverse situations, which, at times, were contradictory, he said, adding that under this pressure, the presiding officers are needed to preserve the dignity and purity of the House. He also talked about challenges faced by the presiding officers on account of the anti-defection law.

The West Bengal assembly Speaker, Hashim Abdul Halim, said the opposition should be given more time to raise peopleâ€™s voice. The presiding officers should set right the ruling party members in the House whenever they try to cross their limits, he added.

Opposition leader Sushil Kumar Modi said in Great Britain, presiding officers are above party politics and maintain the dignity of their chair. He said that the presiding officers should strictly follow the rules and give equal time to the treasury and opposition benches.

3,Two injured in Nalanda group clash,"BIHARSHARIF: Two groups belonging to the local unit of the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) clashed near the gate of Nalanda collectorate at around 11 am on Saturday. Reportedly, two persons were injured in the clash.

The clash occurred when supporters of Pappu Yadav took out a procession fromthe local Soghara High School maidan in protest against the officer in charge of the Bihar police station (PS) Vijay Yadav. The processionists shouted slogans against the officer in-charge and demanded his immediate transfer. They were also shouting slogans against the district administration.

As soon as the procession reached near the gate of the Nalanda district collectorate, some RJD party workers and supporters of RJD MLA Pappu Khan snatched away the microphones, damaged the rickshaw and fired six rounds in the air. However, no one was injured in the firing.

The injured Aftab Alam is reported to be Pappu Khan''s supporter. Another injured Khurshid Ansari is a supporter of Pappu Yadav.

On receiving the information, Nalanda SP Amit Lodha, DSP headquarters Vijay Shankar Prasad and Biharsharif SDO Ibrar Ahmad Qamar rushed to the spot. As soon as the officials reached, the party workers fled.

Nalanda DDC Tarkeshwar Rai was not aware of the incident. According to the Bihar PS officer in-charge, Sanjay Yadav, who was the man behind Saturday''s agitation, was an accused in Banauli case. An FIR (No 97/2000) had been lodged against him. His rifle was seized and the cancellation of its licence was also under consideration, he said. A pamphlet was also circulated by Sanjay Yadav''s supporters. They were aggieved by the killing of Ashok Yadav, an accused in about 20 cases who was killed in a police encounter near Noorsarai recently.

The Nalanda SP has ordered lodging of an FIR against both the groups.

5,Anti-incumbency may affect BJP prospects in Saurashtra,"RAJKOT: With a banner of revolt raised in the BJP over almost all seats in Saurashtra, the party has started the battle of the ballot with its back to the wall. Coupled with the large-scale dissident activities and the anti-incumbency wave, the party is in for a difficult time.

The Keshubhai factor may also play a vital role in the poll prospects of BJP candidates.

Dissidents have come out in the open in Padhadhari, Tankara, Jamjodhpur, Jamnagar, Palitana, Dhoraji, Manavadar, Wankaner and Savarkundla, besides Rajkot. Farmers and local small-scale industrial unit owners too are disenchanted owing to water and power crisis.

With no water, electricity, failure to declare drought in most parts of Saurashtra, rising prices of farm inputs, farmers find themselves in a spot. The state government has also failed to distribute crop insurance which has also added to the misery of agriculturists.

On the industrial front, the ongoing recession has affected the small-scale sector badly.

People here have been asking for local leaders to represent them, as they fear that an outsider would turn his face once poll results were out. Says Ramji Keshwala, a farmer from Manavadar, ""This year, the cotton crop has failed and we had made our representation to the local BJP leader who has pleaded helplessness. As a result, cotton growers have landed in huge debts. If the local BJP leader has adopted such a stand, imagine what would an outsider do if he was elected from our area.""

Similar arguments have been put forward by a cross-section of people soon after the names of candidates were declared.

Most small-scale industry owners have been hit hard by recession, and coupled with power shortage, they are finding it hard to face competition. Businessmen are largely annoyed with the state government''s industrial policy.

Another factor which may mar BJP candidates'' chances is the large-scale corruption in the 60:40 scheme of check-dam construction. Though crores of rupees were sanctioned for check-dams, many were washed away in the rains and many developed breaches.

BJP general secretary Lalji Savalia, who is contesting from Dhoraji against Vithal Radadiay of the Congress, has a difficult task ahead due to his allegedly corrupt methods in check-dam projects. A similar situation prevails in Savarkundla where local BJP leaders D K Patel and taluka BJP president V V Vaghasia have, in an open letter to the BJP leadership, sought a change of the sitting legislator Kalu Virani.

In nearby Wankaner too, the BJP leadership ignored the candidature of Rasik Anadkat, who led the recent farmers agitation against the lifting of water from the Wankaner bore project and its supply to Rajkot.

With dissidents far outnumbering loyal BJP workers, the officials candidates were jittery and were making frantic calls to the BJP high command to salvage the situation.

10,BJP blames Mufti's soft policy for temple attack,"NEW DELHI: Making a scathing attack on the PDP-Congress government in Jammu and Kashmir, the BJP on Sunday said its ""appeasement policy"" towards secessionist forces was responsible for the terrorist attack on Raghunath temple in Jammu and demanded a review of the policy.

""The terrorist strike is a natural fallout of the soft corner of the Congress-PDP government towards terrorists and secessionists. Their morale has been boosted as a result of the state government''s appeasement policy,"" BJP General Secretary and Spokesman Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said.

Condemning the attack as unfortunate, Naqvi urged Chief Minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed to review his government''s policy in the larger national interest and for the peace and prosperity of the state.

""There is an urgent need for a rethink,"" he added.

11,Can illness be a sign of political vulnerability?,"AHMEDABAD: Politics is all about perception. And if there is one perception that politicians don''t like to give of themselves, it is that they are vulnerable.

Even illness is a sign of weakness and men who project a larger-than-life public image would rather deny signs that could betray this image. So when Narendra Modi was hospitalised, following complaints of exhaustion and body-ache three days back, speculations were rife as to whether he had more health problems that he may not like to reveal at this crucial juncture in the run-up to polls.

Efforts were made by party workers, securitymen, hospital staff and even police personnel to prevent newsmen from clicking pictures of an ailing CM. The moment the ambulance brought the CM to the UN Mehta Institute of Cardiology, security personnel and workers surrounded the CM and raised their hands in the air to block the Press.

Modi, at least, has got himself hospitalised. Otherwise, doctors say, there have been instances galore where politicians would go out of their way to keep their illness out of the public eye. ""Late Congress chief minister Chimanbhai Patel had instructed us not to use the hospital vehicle but come in our personal car to examine him. He also directed us not to officially report this medical call to the CM''s residence,"" concedes a senior physician who has treated many politicians.

""During the state parliamentary elections in 1999, I was summoned to see a senior leader in Mehsana who was under acute mental stress. I was taken to a clandestine farm-house where the leader was resting, while his supporters were told that he is campaigning in another part of the constituency,"" says a leading psychiatrist.

Some politicians have even been known to deny and ignore the disease till bigger damage is done. ""Chimanbhai Patel was suffering from a respiratory tract infection. But he chose to ignore it for weeks while campaigning for the Rajya Sabha elections till he succumbed to cardio-respiratory failure. In this age, few die of this disease,"" rues a doctor.

One wonders what could be driving these public figures to obsessively try and keep their illness under wraps. ""Most politicians are powerful people who believe that they can control any situation. Illness exposes them as weak and inferior in the public eye. It is this fear that forces them to consciously and even sub-consciously deny the ailment,"" says psychiatrist Dr Mrugesh Vaishnav, who said that some even use their illness to generate sympathy.

Echoes another psychiatrist Hansal Bhachech: ""Self-esteem of politicians can be abnormally high. Any illness is perceived to render them extremely vulnerable to rejection at the hands of public, desertion by supporters and generally losing control. This is one of the main reasons why most public figures go out of their way to keep sickness under covers.""

""So deeply engraved is this fear of losing control that many politicians not only deny illness but also tend to ignore it as if they just did not suffer from the disease. This eventually can lead to a dangerous end-result,"" says psychiatrist Rajesh Maniar.

12,"After riots, here polls are 'music to the ears'","VADODARA: Just seven months ago, during the riots, their homes were looted and burnt down. But today, life for the residents of the ''Raja-Rani talav basti'' in Panigate is not only back to normal, but also resounds with music.

Elections have come with good news, more for economic reasons than political. The reason being, a number of Muslims and some of the Hindus families here are traditionally engaged in the business of ''dhol and tasa'' playing.

As election nears most political parties use dholis to accompany their campaign rallies to attract voter''s attention and therefore for these people elections mean business.

""We are traditionally known as ''dholwalas'' who play ''Ram dhols'' or ''Nasik dhols'' and the ''Tasa'' an instrument that was traditionally used by the town criers when they had to make royal proclamations.

""Our grandfathers came to the city as they got work in the Gaekwad royal band. Now, most of us form music bands and get assignments during marriages and other religious festivals,"" says Jayesh Pardesi of the ''Pitah Ma Dhol Tasa Party''.

Both Hindus and Muslims here have lived in peace over the years and still share the same camaraderie. For the dholwalas the riots were something that were thrust on them from outside. They have no political interests and love to work for any party that would give them work.

Arif Diwan of the ''Dhamali Dhol Tasa Party'', whose got a contract to play for the BJP and started his work on Saturday when Lakhawala went to file his nomination papers. ""I have no problems playing for any party. I am a Muslim, but I do not mind wearing the saffron head band when I go to work. Similarly, I do not mind when the pujari applies a tilak on my forehead when I play the dhol for a marriage procession or a religious function,"" he says.

Salim Ustad of the ''Bharat Dhol Tasa Party'' says that he too has no problems going for political campaigns and this time he has got a contract from a Congress leader in Savli. ""Last time during the elections I worked for BJP. I have no hassles as long as I earn something,"" he says.

After loss of livelihood in the aftermath of the riots both the Hindu as well as Muslim residents here say that work is all they are interested in and not politics. When campaigning begins next week they would play the dhol with equal fervour may it be the BJP or the Congress.

14,Man arrested for sheltering Rahul,"NEW DELHI: The Delhi Police arrested a sixth person in the Maulana Azad Medical College (MAMC) rape case. He is accused of harbouring Rahul, the main suspect in the case. The pair of jeans Rahul was wearing at the time of the crime was also seized.
