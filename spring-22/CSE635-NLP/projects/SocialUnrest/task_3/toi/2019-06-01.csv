1,PWP urges JDS minister to quit,"MUMBAI: The Peasants and Workers Party (PWP), which had asked its three ministers resign from the Democratic Front (DF) government, has asked the sole Janata Dal Secular) minister to also quit the cabinet.

The Janata Dal (S) has two members in the state legislative assembly; one of them, Mr Dada Jadhavrao, is the minister of state.

2,Verdict on recruits a boost for govt,"CHANDIGARH: With the Punjab and Haryana High Court upholding the state government decision to terminate the services of 28 PCS officers and revert 18 others, uncertainty looms large on more than 3400 persons recruited during the tenure of PPSC chairman Ravinder Pal Singh Sidhu.

Emboldened by the court verdict on Friday, the state government is expected to go ahead with its proposal to conduct a fresh examination for all the 3446 persons recruited during Sidhuâ€™s time.

Only the selected and rejected persons would be entitled to the take the fresh examination.

After the state government announcement to conduct fresh interviews and written tests, Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh and chief secretary YS Ratra earlier this week expressed reservations on the way to deal with the situation.

But now it seems certain that the state government would subject all the selections to scrutiny, the final decision about which would be taken in a few days.

However, official sources affirmed that prior to undertaking this monumental exercise, the Vigilance Bureau (VB) would be asked to formulate a preliminary report regarding the irregularities that might have had happened during the selection of 3446 persons.

The VB is investigating the entire gamut of selections made during the Sidhu period under a separate FIR.

The matter is likely to be discussed at the cabinet meeting scheduled to be held on June 4.

Sources said the governmentâ€™s first priority at this stage would be to explore the possibility to entrusting the entire task of holding the examination afresh to the UPSC.

However, if this does not happen, the government might as well examine the possibility of taking all the 3446 posts out of the purview of the PPSC and hold selections for them under a special committee.

Ratra told Times News Network that the legal advice would be taken before deciding on the procedure, as the entire lot needed to be examined, cadre by cadre and post by post.

3,Probe report names 2 Gujarat ministers,"NEW DELHI: The National Human Rights Commissionâ€™s (NHRC) confidential report on the Gujarat violence - to which the Narendra Modi government has not responded even after two months - says the state administration looked the other way while the murder, rape, loot and arson went on.

The confidential report alleges the involvement of state home minister Gordhan Zadaphia and urban development minister I K Jadeja.

Zadaphia is alleged to have been seen moving in the riot-affected areas openly displaying the â€˜Vâ€™ signal. The report also refers to victims of Naroda Patiya mentioning names of Mayaben Kodnani, MLA and former deputy mayor of Ahmedabad, and VHP leader Jaideep Patel.

In Godhra, where the violence began, Railway Protection Force (RPF) constable Karan Singh Yadav told the NHRC team that he had seen two-three passengers in a scuffle with a tea vendor.

Chatter Singh Chauhan of the Government Railway Police (GRP) said that the â€˜â€˜kar sevaks were trying to force the tea vendor to raise the slogan of Jai Shri Ram.â€™â€™ He also stated that â€˜â€˜one of the kar sevaks had pulled the beard of a Muslim tea vendor and asked him to utter the words Jai Shri Ram.â€™â€™

A visual presentation was made to the NHRC team by state government officials. However, the commission pointed out omissions in the presentation which is contained in the confidential report.

Talking of the presentation, the NHRC said, â€˜â€˜It does not indicate specifically the details of the preventive measures taken at the sensitive points in Ahmedabad.â€™â€™

Also, the community-wise break-up of 273 arrested people was not given as well as no mention was made of destruction of mosques and dargahs in Ahmedabad and elsewhere.

4,PW for arrest of minister,"PATNA: The Magadh division committee of the Peopleâ€™s War has demanded immediate arrest of minister of state for excise Surendra Prasad Yadav for â€œproviding patronage to the Jainandan criminal gang in Masaurhiâ€�.

In a statement to the press here on Friday, secretary of the Magadh division committee of PW Prakash said that this same gang is responsible for recent killing of six innocent people at Lakhnaur in Masaurhi sub-division.

5,Laloo’s brother-in-law threatens taxman now,"Patna: RJD MLC Subhash Yadav, brother of chief minister Rabri Devi and brother-in-law of RJD supremo Laloo Yadav, is again in the thick of a controversy for allegedly threatening and terrorising an officer of the state commercial taxes department.

The controversy follows hard on the heels of the row over alleged forcible lifting of costly cars and other vehicles from different showrooms of the dealers here on the pretext of using them for ferrying VIPs attending the marriage of the second daughter of Laloo and Rabri Devi on May 24.

Subhash is said to have abused and threatened on telephone assistant commercial taxes commissioner of Biharsharif Shiv Sahay Singh for not issuing the â€œno-objection and no-tax dues certificate to a defaulting manufacturing and distributing company of spiced and country liquor.â€�

Subhash was earlier in the news for allegedly abusing and threatening the then city SP of Patna, Jagmohan, in full public view at Boring Road here about six months ago for sealing a foreign liquor shop, and for other acts of â€œmuscle flexingâ€�.

Being â€œterrorised and disgustedâ€� by the incident, Singh, who has written a letter (no. 185 dated May 28, 2002) to state commercial taxes commissioner- cum- secretary Sudhir Kumar informing him about the incident, has gone on leave. He has not been attending his office for the last four days.

When contacted, Kumar admitted that he has received a letter in this regard from Singh.

â€œWe are examining the matter,â€� he said, adding that the assistant commissioner of commercial taxes â€œis on leave because of the illness of his wifeâ€�.

Singh has stated in the letter that Subhash, while threatening him on telephone, put pressure on him to issue a no-objection and no-tax dues certificate to the K D Liquor and Fertiliser Private Ltd which is engaged in manufacturing and distributing country and spiced liquor, said department sources.

The sources said even the commercial taxes commissioner has informed the state excise department about â€œevasion of a huge amount of sales taxâ€� by the company in the sale of spiced and country liquor.

The Patna High Court has also dismissed the plea of the company that it should be allowed to pay commercial taxes on liquor at the discount price and not at the price fixed by the state government.

Despite repeated efforts, Subhash could not be contacted for his comments.

A senior official of the commercial taxes department said the excise department appears to be indifferent to the issue of huge evasion of commercial taxes by the company.

The company has so much influence over the powers that be that its licence is being renewed again and again on an ad hoc basis despite a serious objection raised by the member of the Board of Revenue, who has found that the proprietors of the defaulting company floated a new company for getting a fresh licence for manufacturing and distributing spiced and country liquor in the state, the official added.

6,"Clashes, rigging mark bypolls","Danapur: Clashes, charges of manipulation and presence of a large number of RJD legislators marked the bypoll in the Danapur assembly constituency on Friday.

Home commissioner U N Panjiyar described the bypolls in the two assembly constituencies â€” Danapur and Chhatapur â€” held on Friday as peaceful.

Supporters of both BJP candidate Satya Narayan Singh and the RJD candidate Ramanand Yadav clashed at at least two places â€” near Neora Railway Colony and Rukunpura â€” leading to an exchange of fire.

BJP leaders charged the local police inspector Pramod Kumar with terrorising urban voters around 8 am.

At Rukunpura, there was a heated exchange of words between the the BJP candidate and Nagendra Yadav, nephew of RJD chief Laloo Yadav.

While a large number of RJD leaders were visible on the roads during polling, BJP leaders preferred to remain in their offices. â€œThe RJD is manipulating the election by engineering bogus voting by using fake residential certificates,â€� said BJP MLC Giriraj Kishore. The BJP leaders produced a pack of â€œfake residential certificatesâ€�, which, they claimed, had been snatched from an RJD worker at a polling booth.

The presence of voters at polling booths in the town area was low. The low turnout was the result of the insistence of the polling employees on residential certificates. Controversial RJD MLC Azad Gandhi was seen outside Baldeva High School distributing â€œresidential certificatesâ€� to voters.

The EVMs became an object of curiosity There appeared to be a lack of awareness among voters about using the EVMs.

7,E-mail helps nail 3 govt staffers for graft,"BANGALORE: Chief Minister S M Krishna''s e-governance efforts paid off to a certain extent on Thursday when an e-mail enabled the Revenue Department to nail three lower-level sub-registrar office employees for involving ``volunteers'''' in an extortion racket.

On May 25, the CM received an email from a citizen detailing the harassment he faced at the hands of employees of the KR Puram sub-registrar''s office.

``Officials are asking Rs 4,000 as bribe to do the property registration for a 30'' x 40'' site. If the plot size increases, the bribe amount also increases,'''' the mail said, a copy of which was made available to Times News Network.

The citizen also had a suggestion for the CM. ``If we do not give the money, the registration is not done. Probably if you go as an ordinary citizen to do registration, you will understand the problem we have been facing,'''' the mail said.

The e-mail was forwarded to Inspector-General of Registration and Commissioner of Stamps (IGRCS) D. Satya Murty for verification and action. On Thursday evening, the IGRCS visited the K.R. Puram sub-registrar''s office, incognito. For over 30 minutes, he mingled in the general chaos without revealing his identity, sources said.

``He found a couple of people clutching a sheaf of registered documents but were obviously not officials. When he confronted them, they had no defence and tried to apologise. The IGRCS then asked the sub-registrar to submit a written report on the whole thing, and instructed officials to book police complaints against these people for trespassing and corruption,'''' the sources said.

The sources said that the attender, a peon and a clerk were running a racket, using volunteers as touts to bring in clients and collect bribe money.

``When they denied their activities, he produced a tape on which he had recorded their conversation on the transactions, which helped to nail them,'''' the sources said.

Revenue Minister H C Srikantaiah, who was apprised of the CM''s email, approved action against the employees. ``We want to send out a message that no employee will be spared,'''' he said.

8,CM offers talks to quell bandh,"KOLKATA: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has appealed to opposition parties on Friday to withdraw their bandh call in the state.

He is ready for talks on the issues raised by them at any point of time, he added. â€œThe state assembly is beginning its session from June 7. All these issues can be discussed in the assembly, where they can give their views while we defend ours. If they are not willing to wait till then, I am willing to meet them anytime before that,â€� Bhattacharjee told reporters at the state secretariat.

Trinamul supremo Mamata Banerjee, however, ruled out any rethink on the bandh issue. Pradesh Congress president Pranab Mukherjee has convened an executive meeting June 2 to discuss it.

â€œWhy should we withdrawn the bandh? Have they conceded our demands,â€� Banerjee asked, reacting to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattahcarjeeâ€™s appeal. Banerjee, however, reacted positively to the CMâ€™s proposal to discuss the issues raised by the Opposition.

On Friday, the Left Front appealed to the Trinamul and the Congress to withdraw their respective bandhs in the interest of the common people. â€œI request both the parties to withdraw their bandhs. Otherwise the people will suffer,â€� Front chairman Biman Bose said after an emergency meeting of the Left Front held at the CPM headquarters.

Describing the bandhs as politically motivated, Bose said that they had been called because of the ongoing game of one-upmanship between the TMC and the Congress.

â€œBut why should the people be made to suffer,â€� Bose said. The Front chairman also urged them to defy the both the bandhs.

9,Hike in pay for MCH contractors ruled out,"HYDERABAD: The Congress corporators in the Municipal Corporation of Hyderabad (MCH) were in for a major embarrassment when their demand for hike in unit rates for contractors engaged for cleaning city roads was struck down by the civic officials.

The corporators had sought to justify their demand for the hike claiming that it was contractorsâ€™ efforts that ensured the cleanliness of the city and helped the civic body retain the Clean City Award, which is given by the Centre, for the third consecutive year.

However, the officials, rejecting the corporatorsâ€™ demand, said that the present rates were ideal to ensure a reasonable margin of profit for the contractors.

To substantiate their contention that the rates were rational, the officials observed that more and more contractors were coming forward to execute work at the rates fixed by the MCH.

The MCH has received 644 tenders this year for 88 sanitation works as against 525 last year. This is a clear indication that the contractors were satisfied with the existing rates, the officials observed.

â€œThis act by the corporators clearly shows that they are hand-in-glove with the contractors and are only looking at the interest of few contractors, throwing the tax payers money to the wind,â€� an MCH official said.

Each unit engaged by the MCH for cleaning city roads comprises 18 workers and one supervisor.

Each such is paid Rs 41,000 per month if it is engaged for sweeping roads during the day, and Rs 58,000 during the night.

The areas where night units work, an additional eight workers and one supervisor are posted during the day. Each unit is entrusted with sweeping of about three to nine km road.

The demand for hike in unit rates was made by the corporators at an awareness programme on tender system conducted by the officials to the standing committee members.

The meeting was organised to enlighten the newly elected corporators about the MCH procedures in the wake complaints that the elected members were being kept in the dark by officials.

â€œActually, we need not tell them about the tender system or how we select the contractors. When we did so with a good intention, they are trying to force their views on to the process,â€� a senior officer said.

However, the request to increase the number of units to cover more localities in the city was agreed to by the officials. The corporation is also considering selection of more contractors and keep some in reserve to utilise their service as and when corporator complains about poor sanitation in his or her ward.

10,Dreaded don arrested in district,"KOLKATA: Notorious gangster Salim Laskar was arrested from Mamudpur in South 24-Parganas on Friday night.

Salim is wanted by the Kolkata Police for the abduction of businessman Dinesh Singhania and also in several dacoity cases.

According to DSP Deb Kumar Ganguly, Salim was on his way to visit his sick daughter when he was nabbed. Salim, in his late 30â€™s was arrested around six years ago for a daring dacoity in the Mograhat area. He jumped bail and returned to a life of crime. He, however, built up a â€˜Robin-hoodâ€™ like reputation in the villages around Mograhat and was given shelter by locals. He had also donated an ambulance to a local village. As result, it was difficult for police to nab him. Police got information about Salimâ€™s movements from 45-year-old Hossain Mollah, another notorious criminal, who was arrestedfor drug trafficking.

11,NHRC indicts Modi govt,"NEW DELHI: The National Human Rights Commissionâ€™s (NHRC) final report on the Gujarat violence has indicted the Narendra Modi government for its â€˜â€˜comprehensive failure to protect... the people of Gujaratâ€™â€™ and documented the manner in which criminal cases arising from the violence are being fudged.

The report, released on Friday, dismisses most of the claims the Gujarat government made in its April 12 response to the commissionâ€™s preliminary findings. Since the state government is yet to reply to the NHRCâ€™s confidential report, the commission also decided to release the same.

The NHRCâ€™s final report is unambiguous in its conclusion: â€˜â€˜Despite the measures reportedly taken by the state government, which are recounted in its report of April 12, that report testifies to the increasing numbers who died or were injured or deprived of their liberty and compelled to seek shelter in relief camps... The commission has, therefore, reached the definite conclusion that there was a comprehensive failure of the state to protect the constitutional rights of the people of Gujarat.â€™â€™

The Gujarat governmentâ€™s reply apropos Godhra that there was proper communication with Uttar Pradesh intelligence on the movement of kar sevaks has also not been believed by the NHRC.

â€˜â€˜It appears incomprehensible to the commission that a matter which had been the subject of repeated communication between the Gujarat IB and the UP state police as to the outgoing travel plans of the kar sevaks, should have been so abysmally lacking in intelligence as to their return journeys,â€™â€™ the commission noted.

The NHRC has also dismissed the state governmentâ€™s claim that 27,780 people had been arrested. The commission refers to the report given P G J Nampoothiri, its special representative in Gujarat, who said that â€˜â€˜almost 90 per cent of those arrested even in heinous offences like murder, arson, etc. have managed to get bailâ€™â€™.

The commission has criticised the state government for not giving enough details on major cases like Naroda Patia, Gulbarga Society and Best Bakery. Equally scathing is the NHRCâ€™s comment on the manner in which FIRs were distorted.

Dismissing the state governmentâ€™s response, it refers to Nampoothiriâ€™s report which says that in sensational cases, the FIRs show accused persons as â€˜â€˜unknownâ€™â€™.

The commission has specifically taken up the security of Justices Kadri and Divecha. The NHRC felt that Justice Kadri was compelled to move from house to house â€˜â€˜because of pervasive insecurityâ€™â€™.

It has reacted more strongly on the issue of Justice Divechaâ€™s security. â€˜â€˜There were communal reasons for the repeated and specifically targeted attacks on Justice Divechaâ€™s property,â€™â€™ the NHRC observed.

12,Stray incidents mar bypolls,"DUMKA: Amid heavy security arrangements, the byelection in the Dumka parliamentary constituency on Friday passed off peacefully with about 55 per cent voters exercising their franchise through electronic voting machines (EVMs).

The EVMs were used for the first time in Jharkhand.

Even Ramgarh block, which saw two incidents of violence between the supporters of the BJP and the JMM during the electioneering, reported no untoward incident on Friday.

The claim of district electoral officer Avinash Kumar notwithstanding, some of the polling officers appeared to be taking least interest in implementing the code of conduct.

During a visit to different polling stations of Dumka, Jama and Palajori blocks, this correspondent found that many people were casting votes without getting their identity verified by the authorities concerned.

Some government employees deployed at the polling stations took advantage of the ignorance of voters about the new voting system and goaded them into pressing the button of a particular symbol. Meanwhile, minor incidents of violence marked polling in Danapur, near Patna.

Minor clashes, charges of manipulation and presence of a large number of RJD legislators marked polling in the Danapur assembly constituency on Friday. However, the voter turnout in the town area was low.

While the BJP leaders accused local police inspector Pramod Kumar of terrorising urban voters in the morning, supporters of both the BJP candidate, Satya Narayan Singh, and the RJD contestant clashed at two places leading to an exchange of fire.

At Rukunpura, there was a sharp exchange of words between the BJP candidate and Nagendra Yadav, nephew of RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav. Around 2.30 p.m., the RJD complained to an election observer alleging that the BJP candidate and his supporters had opened fire at four places.

Polling in the town area was marked by low voter turn-out. This was being attributed to the polling officialsâ€™ insistence on votersâ€™ identity verification certificates.

Byelections in the three assembly segments of Saidapet, Vaniyambadi and Acharapakkam in Tamil Nadu went off peacefully despite allegations of rigging. And the voter turn-out in all the three assembly segments was said to be around 60 per cent.

Complaints came in from the DMK alleging that former state minister K. Ponmudi was assaulted by some AIADMK functionaries in a booth in Saidapet.

Talking to reporters in the morning, DMK president M. Karunanidhi said that Ponmudi had gone to Saidapet to lodge a complaint with the presiding officer about distribution of residence certificates by some AIADMK supporters.

When Ponmudi entered the booth he was attacked by the state Slum Clearance Board chairman, N. Balaganga, and his followers. Ponmudi, who was the chief election agent for the DMK candidate, sustained injuries on his leg, Karunanidhi added.

He claimed that till 10 am polling went off peacefully but later on, the AIADMK resorted to violence and skirmishes.

13,Workshop on urban transport policy,"NEW DELHI: Urban transport policy will be the focus of a two-day workshop starting June 4 in the Capital.

Urban planners, transport experts, government officials, academicians and financial institutions will come together in this government initiative to debate various issues.

These issues include increasing road congestion, falling journey speeds, more air pollution and accidents, high fuel consumption, unreliable, unsafe and uncomfortable public transport. The use of personalised motor vehicles, says the urban development ministry, has been growing at a rate of 6 to 15 per cent a year.

In most cities, scooters and motorcycles are more than 70 per cent of the total motor vehicles.

â€˜â€˜Desirableâ€™â€™ modes of transport â€” mass transit, non-motorised transport and walking â€” are on the decline.

This has many obvious unhappy effects on quality of life, efficiency and competitiveness.

14,Tougher law mooted to curb sex determination tests,"NEW DELHI: The Union Cabinet decided on Friday that the law to curb tests on pregnant women to determine the sex of the foetuses will be made more stringent.

It will now cover the use of ultrasound machines, will prescribe stricter punishment to the guilty and arm the authority with search and seizure powers, including sealing of premises and commissioning of witnesses.

Pre-natal Diagnostic Techniques (Regulation and Prevention of Misuse) Act will also have a new title as it now covers the pre-conception stage. It will be called the Pre-conception and Pre-natal Diagnostic Techniques (Prohibition of Sex Selection) Act.

Parliamentary affairs minister Pramod Mahajan said the law would seek to tackle the misuse of tests employing emerging medical technologies such as pre-conception selection of sex so as to prevent misuse of these technologies.

Decisions taken at the meeting which was presided over by Prime Minister Vajpayee included reopening the consulate in Mandaley, neighbouring Myanmarâ€™s trade centre, which has a large population of people of Indian origin. This signifies the warming up of relations between New Delhi and Yangon. Myanmar is to reopen its consulate in Kolkata which was closed in 1979.

The Cabinet also decided to continue subsidised helicopter services to Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya and Tripura, which cover long distances and have poor local service conditions. Mahajan said the subsidy would be shared 75-25 per cent by the Union and the state governments.

The Cabinet also decided that the 150,000 free calls annually for the MPs would cover a telephone used for internet connection.

India is to ratify the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for food and agriculture.

15,3 farmers killed in Jind,"CHANDIGARH: Three farmers were killed and six injured on Friday when the police fired on agitating Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) activists who had blocked the Jind-Hansi road near Gulkani village in Jind district of Haryana.

Though the state government is yet to confirm the deaths, reliable sources reveal that the deceased are Dilbagh Singh alias Bagha of Rajpura village, Prakash Sharma and Bajinder Singh. The injured are reported to have been taken to Rohtak Medical College Hospital.

Initial reports indicate that the police first resorted to lathi-charge but when the agitating farmers refused to lift the blockade near Gulkani village, they had to open fire.

The official version, however, is that the police party had to resort to firing in self-defence as the agitators were bent upon attacking it with lethal arms. Two buses were also burnt by BKU activists who are spearheading the agitation in support of their demand for release of their arrested leaders and waiver of power arrears.

With this, the total number of those killed in the 13-day-old farmersâ€™ agitation in the state has gone up to five.

In another incident, six farmers were injured near Mirchpur village on the Barwala-Jind road when the police resorted to lathi-charge to disperse farmers who had blocked the road. What is worrying the authorities is that farmers have started blocking roads in Rohtak and Hisar districts as well.

It was at Gulkani village that one BKU activist was killed in police firing on Wednesday. On May 19, one farmer had lost his life in a clash with the police near Kandela village.

Ridiculing chief minister Om Prakash Chautalaâ€™s allegation that the ongoing â€˜â€˜so-called farmersâ€™ agitationâ€™â€™ was the handiwork of anti-social elements and frustrated Opposition parties, Ghasi Ram Nain, president of BKUâ€™s Haryana unit, on Friday said Chautala himself was responsible for the agitation.

24,Mamata accuses CPM of attacking party,"KOLKATA: Trinamool Congress chairperson Mamata Banerjee on Saturday accused the CPI-M of ''systematically annihilating'' her party workers and said it was being done to eliminate political opposition.

Banerjee said that Rabindranath Das, a Trinamool worker was shot dead this morning at Charu Avenue in her constituency in the metropolis which indicated law and order prevailing in the state.

She also denied allegations by state CPI-M secretary Anil Biswas that Trinamool had joined hands with the People''s War Group to create terror in the state.

On the contrary, Banerjee said, the CPI-M had invited PWG cadres and supplied them arms before last year''s assembly poll.

Marxist cadres were becoming victims of inter-party rivalry in Midnapore, she claimed.

Banerjee said that her partymen were driven out of their villages in Midnapore and wondered how they could resort to violence.

Asked whether the Trinamool Congress would include political violence as one of the issues for the proposed statewide bandh on June 7, Banerjee said that her party had protested against it for long and the bandh would be observed on other issues.

25,Regional parties hold key to Goa govt,"NEW DELHI: The BJP may have staked claim to government formation in Goa, but the Congress, at just one seat less, will not allow easy passage. With both parties short of majority in the Goa Assembly elections, the regional parties hold the key.

The BJP moved swiftly on Saturday as results came in, electing outgoing CM Manohar Parrikar as legislative party leader and declaring it would try and form government in the state. The party has won 17 seats, four short of simple majority.

But the Congress, at 16, feels it is better placed to swing the support of the other parties like UGDP, MGP and NCP, which it says fought the elections on an anti-communal forces platform. AICC General Secretary Oscar Fernandes is rushing to Goa to hold talks with the regional parties.

Buoyed by its better-than-expected performance, the BJP is going to try and form the government in Goa, said BJP General Secretary Pyarelal Khandelwal.

""The verdict of the people of Goa is quite clear â€” our strength has gone up from 10 to 18 seats. The Congress has gone down from 21 seats to 16. This is a positive vote for the BJP and a negative one for the Congress,"" says Khandelwal.

The BJP has won 18 seats in Goa, including one independent backed by the party.

With the BJP requiring the support of three more MLAs to form the government, Khandelwal says that the local party units will begin consultations with regional parties later in the evening.

""It is too early to say how the talks will progress,"" says Khandelwal. The Congress, meanwhile, too has indicated that it will try and stake claim to form the government.

Describing the results as a mandate against the BJP, Congress leader Oscar Fernandes said: ``The result in Goa is a manadate for a secular formation.""

The party is disappointed with its performance, but leaders point out that it comes in the face of ""blatant manipulation anmd use of money and machinery by the BJP, which was in power.""

The BJP, however, attributes its ""success"" to performance.

""What is interesting is that the BJP has won despite the Congress trying to play the Gujarat card. Further, the BJP has won in areas dominated by Christians,"" says Khandelwal.

""It is a verdict for the BJP government in Goa for the last one-and-a-half years,"" says Khandelwal.

All eyes will now be on the regional parties - the United Goan Democratic Party has won 3 seats while independent and others have bagged the other four.

Goa politics has seen a tumultuous time since the last elections in 1999. The Congress, which won that election with a simple majority of 21 in the Assembly, split twice, allowing a rag-tag coalition led by the BJP to assume power.

Observers feel the fact that the BJP-led NDA is in power in the Centre can swing matters in its favour. The regional parties will tend to keep that in mind if they have to cast their lot with one of the national parties.

Goa may be a small state, but the timing of the election has made it crucial for everyone involved. For the BJP, a win here has come as a big morale booster after its debacle in recent elections all over the country and the Gujarat incidents.

Observers also feel the party is using the Goa elections as a barometer for public sentiment before deciding on calling elections in Gujarat.

For the Congress, bagging Goa would have endorsed its already strengthening position in the states, especially as the party now fancies its chances in the next Lok Sabha elections.

26,Guj Cong demands action against party MLA,"AHMEDABAD: Irked over beleaugered Chief Minister Narendra Modi''s reported ""coup"" of masterminding a public felicitation by a minority Congress MLA, Gujarat Congress on Saturday asked party high command to take ""stringent disciplinary"" action against the legislator.

""This is a very serious matter... the action of the MLA was in clear defiance of party stand and Sonia Gandhi''s directives to boycott Modi''s public function,+ Gujarat Pradesh Congress president Amarsinh Chaudhary said. He said a formal recommendation has been made to the high command to take ""stringent action"" against Wankaner MLA Khurshid Haider Pirzada.

In a defiant stance, Pirzada felicitated Modi at a function last evening at his constituency in Rajkot district on behalf of Momin Shia sect sending shockwaves in party circles and taking a large section of minorities by surprise. A visibly upset Chaudhary said that party legislator''s action has ""hurt the people of Gujarat and minorities"" in particular at a time when some corrective steps were taken to heal the injury caused to the battered community during riots.

Post-Godhra, Modi was virtually considered a ""political pariah"" by the Congress for his ""inept handling of the riots"" and the party had been demanding his ouster.

Earlier in the day, an equally angry CLP leader Naresh Raval said that he had spoken to the MLA and asked him to explain in writing the factors behind his decision to felicitate Modi.

27,Govt seeks reversal of VSNL investment decision,"NEW DELHI: The government has asked the Tatas for a review of the VSNL board''s decision to invest Rs 1,200 crore in Tata Teleservices on the ground of disagreement over the decision making process, and said that its nominee be taken in the Board committee for detailed discussion on the desirabiliy of the proposed investment.

In a strongly worded letter to the VSNL, in which Tatas acquired 45 per cent stake and management control, Department of Telecom is understood to have said that the proposed action was aimed at bringing transparency in the decision making in the interest of stakeholders and the company.

When contacted, a Tata Group spokesperson confirmed the receipt of the letter but declined to comment saying ""we would give our reply in due course.""

In its letter, the government is believed to have asserted that communication for the May 28 board meeting sent to government nominees on May 23 and May 27 comprised only a one-page letter without any agenda or note and hence that could not be treated as full and complete notice.

Citing the disagreement, the government said that in view of the short notice of less than seven days, and the provision of section 372 (5) of Companies Act, there was a need for detailed discussion on any item relating to investment decision.

Defending the VSNL''s decision to invest Rs 1,200 crore in Tata Teleservices, Tatas said on Friday it ""was in consonance with all the provisions of shareholders agreement and in compliance with all aspects of Company Law.""

Severely criticising the Tatas, the Communication Minister had threatened legal action in case the VSNL''s investment decision was not reversed and had said his ministry would write to the Mumbai based corporate house on the issue.

28,SP plays it safe on Presidential polls,"NEW DELHI: The Samajwadi Party wormed out of a sticky situation on Saturday by taking the moral high ground on the Presidential elections, promising to back any consensus candidate.

Putting the ball neatly in the court of the NDA government and main Opposition Congress party, SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav criticised both for having floated names of likely candidates without consultations for consensus.

""The Prime Minister and the leader of Opposition (Sonia Gandhi) should have made an effort, but we don''t know what goes on inside. It would have been better if they had evolved a consensus together on so sensitive an issue,"" he said, adding the Lok Morcha would deliberate on the issue and announce its decision very soon.

SP sources have said that the party was not in favour of supporting Narayanan as it did not agree with the rest of the Opposition''s view on his performance as President. ""We will not support Narayanan"", said an SP leader emphatically.

Like all else with the Samajwadi Party, these reservations have a UP angle. The party holds his refusal in 1997 to endorse the dismissal of the Kalyan Singh-led BJP government in UP against him.

But Mulayam now has to contend with the fact that his Lok Morcha allies, the Left parties, have openly supported a second term for Narayanan as President. A fact that he assiduously sought to brush away.

He refused to comment on a second term for Narayanan, saying: ""We have not considered or discussed any name yet."" He even denied having discussed Narayanan''s name at a one-hour meeting with CPM leader Harkishen Singh Surjeet on Saturday.

There was more than a hint of Lok Morcha constituents being at odds. Asked how he explained the fact that senior leaders like Somnath Chatterjee had recommended a second term for Narayanan and described him as their candidate, Mulayam asked brusquely: ""Would you rather believe the Lok Morcha convenor or anyone else?""

The Narayanan issue is only the latest in string of concerns that have seen tension among the Lok Morcha constituents. The last time around, it was the Flex Industries issue when Mulayam Singh supported Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha even as the rest of the Opposition attempted to put him in the dock in Parliament.

The Samajwadi Party is cut up with the Congress for not offering crucial support to form the government in UP and has sulked about its allies'' attempts to get close to the party on a secular agenda.

Although there have been efforts to bring about an Opposition unity and even a possible alternative government, the mistrust between the Congress and the Samajwadi Party seems to be the biggest hurdle.
