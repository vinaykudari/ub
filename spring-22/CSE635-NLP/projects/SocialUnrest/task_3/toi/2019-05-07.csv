0,JDU asks govt to reject `suicide report',"GULBARGA: National Secretary of Janata Dal (U) and former deputy speaker of the Legislative Council B R Patil has urged the government to turn down the Veeresh Committee report on farmers.

He asserted that the report, which said that all the suicide cases of the farmers were not due to crop failure, would create a sense of insecurity, suspicion and hatred among the farmers and the society including the government.

Speaking at a press conference here on Sunday, Patil said that the report submitted by Dr Veeresh Committee was ""unscientific and irrelevant"". He said that instead of suggesting ways to the government on helping the farmers, it has come out with suggestions on how to ""punish the farmers"".

Patil claimed that he expected this sort of report long ago when this committee was formed as there was no representation from the farming community in this committee.

Patil was of the view that the government nominated Deshpande of Institution for Social and Economic Change (ISEC) as one of the members of the committee ""who is known for his pro-World Bank and pro-World Trade Organisation"" views.

Patil alleged that the report of the Veeresh Committee was finalised in the chambers of Deshpande and not in the office of Dr Veeresh, who headed the panel.

The JD(U) leader took strong exception to the recommendation made by the Veeresh Committee to hold a CBI probe to punish the persons giving wrong information about the suicides of farmers as he described it as ""an insult to the farmers"".

""This recommendation will become a boon to the police department to torture the farmers who go to them to report about the suicide cases of the farmers,"" he felt.

Patil said that this report was prepared just to please the World Bank and the World Trade Organisation as the state government has borrowed huge amount of money from these organisations in the name of ""developing infrastructure"" in Karnataka.

He said that the views expressed in the report that most of the suicides of farmers have occurred due to heavy drinking and family quarrel was not at all acceptable to anybody.

""Drinking is common nowadays in urban and rural areas and it cannot be treated as the reason behind all the suicide cases. And in most of the family quarrels, it is a well known fact that money plays a major role. Even in the case of farmers, family quarrel can be fatal to the extent of pushing the farmer to commit suicide as it is the strong indicator of the bad economic conditions of that family.""

The former deputy chairman of the Legislative Council appealed to Chief Minister Krishna to reject the report of the Veeresh Committee and come forward to help the farmers in their trouble.

1,BJP asks govt to come clean on decentralisation,"BANGALORE: BJP leader Jagadish Shettar on Monday urged the state government to table the Task Force Report on Decentralisation in both Houses of the legislature before implementing it.

Speaking to reporters here, Shettar said he participated in the meeting convened by the Rural Development and Panchayat Raj (RDPR) Minister M.Y. Ghorpade and suggested that the elected representatives in panchayat bodies at all the three levels - district, taluk and village - should be given greater powers.

""Presently, bureaucratic domination is too much which defeats the purpose of panchayat bodies,"" he said.

The meeting called by Ghorpade discussed the report of the task force headed by Additional Chief Secretary N. Vishwanathan on decentralisation in panchayat bodies. The meeting will continue on Tuesday also.

According to Shettar, gram sabhas were just an eyewash as several decisions taken in gram sabha meetings are changed at the taluk and district level. Officials look at gram sabha with contempt and this attitude should change.

""I am for bringing drastic changes to the present Panchayat Raj Act but the opinion of taluk and zilla panchayat presidents should be taken before bringing amendments,"" he added.

2,Model Madhyamik answers may rule out arbitrary marking,"KOLKATA: Students who have appeared for this yearâ€™s Madhyamik examination will not have too much room for complaints about irregu-larities in the results and marks obtained. For the first time in the state, examiners are being made to check answer scripts against a set of model answers for all the eight papers.

â€œThis was to ensure that the â€˜choiceâ€™ and â€˜personalâ€™ preferences of exam-iners do not cause any harm to the student concerned,â€� said Haraprasad Samaddar, president of West Bengal Board of Secondary Education. The move, claimed Samaddar, was adopted for the first time in the state and would provide each examiner with a set of model answer scripts in his or her subject.

The model answers have been provided by a group of experts, who also framed the questions for this yearâ€™s examination.

â€œAs Madhyamik is not an objective test, a lot used to depend on the discretion of teachers and the language and the way the answer used to be framed,â€� said the board official.

But this, he said, affected students in a negative way.

â€œThough we could not frame the examination in a multiple choice format or set objective type questions, we thought that a system was needed where, if two students have answered the same question in two different ways, both re-ceived similar marks. So this time we stressed that if any student covered certain points in an answer, he should not lose out,â€� he said.

â€œIf a student includes certain points in his answer, he will have to be awarded certain marks, and in case the student has written in the order set by our experts, he or she will have to be given full marks. The order of writing the points and presentation skills will determine finer adjust-ments in the overall tally,â€� he said.

As this was the first year, random sampling would be done to find out if any examiner had violated the model answers and awarded marks out of his â€˜discretionâ€™.

â€œFrom this time, we think that examiners will stop using their discretion and adhere to the model answers supplied by us,â€� the of-ficial said.

This move is part of an initiative that has been taken to standardise the evaluation process. â€œWe are also thinking hard about standardising the syllabi as in other states. But we thought the evaluation process should come first as it directly affects the career of a student,â€� Samaddar said.

This year, the board has employed more examiners compared to previous years, claimed Samaddar.

â€œThis way, each examiner is correcting lesser number of scripts which means that they will make less mistakes. The pressure of checking scripts on some examiners was really getting tough,â€� he said.

Due to the involvement of more examiners, the results of the Madhyamik examination will be released by May, assured Samaddar. â€œWe hope that this yearâ€™s result will be published well in advance as a lot more teachers have participated in checking answer scripts,â€� he said.

3,Asiatic Society polls not free from malpractices,"KOLKATA:Accusations of browbeating, intimidation and electoral malpractices dominated proceedings, as less than a third of the 1,175 members of the Asiatic Society turned up on Monday to elect a new gov-erning council to run affairs of the 218-year-old â€˜institution of national importanceâ€™ for the next 12 months.

The elections this time were fought bitterly - with three rival groups vy-ing for power. The election process began a little before noon with mem-bers queuing up to caste their ballot.While the official panel has histo-rian Amalendu De as the presidential nominee and Dilip Coomer Ghose for general secretary, the main opposition panel has put up former vice chancellor Sushil Mukherjee and former vice president of the society Gu-rupada Sandilya for the same posts. In as many as 15 of the 20 posts for which elections were held - there were no consensus candidate.

The elections had its share of controversy with Sandilya claiming that only â€œobservers friendly to the official panel were allowed inside the ballot box room during voting.â€�

In a strongly worded letter to outgoing president Biswanath Banerjee, Sandilya and former general secretary Anil Sarkar wrote, â€œWe put on re-cord that you refused to allow even one observer from the Opposition panel to be put in the room where the ballot boxes were kept.We appre-hend that this may have been a deliberate step to hamper free and fair electionsâ€�.

â€œVoters told me that the observers were intimidating voters if they took time to write down the name of a opposite side candidate in place of the official nominee.They were asked to â€˜hurry upâ€™. Isnâ€™t this intimidation?â€� Sandilya asked.

The AGM in the evening also witnessed chaotic scenes with rival parties accusing each other of trying to sabotage the otherâ€™s good work and harming the instituteâ€™s reputation.

4,Gowda issues govt a week's deadline,"KUSHALNAGAR: Former prime minister H D Deve Gowda on Saturday served a seven-day ultimatum on the Congress government in Karnataka to resolve the issues facing the people or else face the ignominy of being thrown out of office.

Addressing a rally at GMP school grounds here, Gowda said the failure of the government to meet the demands of the people would prove costly as the Janata Dal (Secular) will chalk out a statewide agitation to topple the government.

""We are ready to enter the jail to snatch power from the Congress,"" Gowda, who was recently elected to the Lok Sabha in a by-election from Kanakapura, said.

Gowda said formation of third front was inevitable as the country was going through a sensitive phase.

The JD(S) would prove to be a powerful third front as the Union and Karnataka governments lack the support of the poor and the farmers due to their ""sheer arrogance"".

The Lok Sabha member said both Union and state governments knew nothing of coffee and agriculture.

Taking a dig at the Centre, he said more than 6 crore youths have no jobs. It may be recalled that the Centre had promised employment for at least one crore youths.

Driven into desperation, the unemployed youth are taking to unethical practices like disturbing communal harmony in Gujarat and other places, he said.

Gowda said farmers are not beggars, whose interests should never be overlooked. Calling upon the people to explode the myth that only A B Vajpayee or Sonia Gandhi could rule the country, Gowda said the Janata Dal (Secular) will begin its fight from Kodagu to provide better governance in the state and at the Centre.

Former deputy chief minister Siddaramaiah said the Union and state governments are ""getting a taste of the opposition in parliamentary politics"" only after Gowda emerged victorious at the Kanakapura hustings. The Janata Dal (Secular) has triggered a revolution against communal forces, he said.

6,Tie-up with BSP to avoid polls: Rajnath,"KANPUR: Former chief minister of the state Raj Nath Singh owned responsibility for the partyâ€™s poor show in the last assembly elections.

Singh said that he had failed to make direct contact with party workers and the people due to the constraints of chief ministers.

Singh further said that the party had not colluded with the BSP for any political gain but to avoid another election in the state. The former chief minister was in the city to meet his adopted sons Vijendra and Shivprasad, who were studying in VNSD Shiksha Niketan.

Talking to news persons here at the circuit house on Monday, the former chief minister said that there were plenty of reasons for the unexpected assembly results for the party and added that he was the only one responsible for the debacle of the BJP in the state election. Singh, known for his rhetoric, was an unhappy looking man today for many reasons, mostly known.

Singh said it was not necessary to reveal the cause of the partyâ€™s debacle in the last assembly election, but claimed that he had not proved upto the mark in the senior leadersâ€™ calculation, who he said had raised him to the post of chief minister of the state. Singh also said that those found engaged in acts of indiscipline during elections would have action taken against them.

He said that earlier the Samajwadi Party was given the chance to show its strength in front of the governor but he failed and, therefore, it became the moral responsibility of the party to avoid another election in the state. He also said that the Samajwadi Party was hatching a conspiracy to impose another election in the state. The faint looking former CM said that the formation of the government was not for the any political benefits and said that being a responsible party, the BJP couldnâ€™t put the state through another round of elections. However, the former chief minister refused to comment on the future of the BJP-BSP government in the state and claimed that the partyâ€™s first priority was to prove a majority in the assembly.

7,Demand for Singhal’s arrest,"LUCKNOW: Senior vice-president of Congress Ram Krisha Dwivedi in a statement has demanded the arrest of Vishwa Hindu Parishad leader Ashok Singhal under Pota for terming the genocide of Muslims in Gujarat as â€˜pride of Hindutvaâ€™.

The Congress leader said that Singhal by glorifying the Gujarat carnage had in fact proved that state sponsored terrorism in Gujarat was part of the Sangh Parivarâ€™s political philosophy. â€œThe VHP leader by justifying the carnage of the minority community also tried to create communal hatred which bears testimony to the fact that the Sangh Parivarâ€™s â€˜Hindutva agendaâ€™ is an organised programme of genocide of the minority communityâ€�, he charged.

Meanwhile, the executive committee of the UP Mahila Congress at its meeting held here on Monday expressed grave concern over the communal frenzy and organised carnage of Muslims in Gujarat. The meeting has condemned â€œthe mass killings of members of the minority community, torching of their houses, hotels and business establishments, rape of women by the RSS, VHP, Bajrang Dal and Shiv Sena workers under the active patronage of Modi government in the presence of police officers.â€� The meeting demanded the trial of guilty persons involved in these incidents under the special courts. The meeting took a decision to frustrate the designs of communal forces trying to vitiate communal harmony in the state. The Mahila Congres workers also decided to continue their ongoing public awareness campaign at all district headquarters of the state till May 21 to maintain communal harmony.

9,"SP, RKP in deal for by-polls","LUCKNOW: Politics makes strange bedfellows. And this seems to be true in Uttar Pradesh. Once sworn enemy of Mulayam Singh Yadav, Kalyan Singh has clinched a deal with the him to have an alliance with the Samajwadi Party in by-polls for four assembly seats and one Lok Sabha seat slated for May 31 in the state.

As per the agreement between the Samajwadi Party and the Rashtriya Kranti Party (RKP), the SP would support the RKP candidate in Dibai assembly seat, vacated by Kalyan Singh, while Kalyan would support the Samajwadi Party on remaining seats, including Baheri (Bareilly), Jehangirganj (Ambedkarnagar) and Kunda (Pratapgarh) where Election Commission has countermanded the polls in the constituency represented by former minister Raguraj Pratap Singh alias Raja Bhaiyya.

Confirming the alliance, the RKP president Kalyan Singh said that an understanding had been reached with the Samajwadi Party to contest the by-polls jointly.

The RKP may also not field any candidate in Ambedkarnagar Lok Sabha seat vacated by chief minister Mayawati. â€œIf Samajwadi Party puts up a candidate there, we will support him there too,â€� said the RKP president.

Taking advantage of the Congress playing truant to opposition unity in Uttar Pradesh, the RKP is learnt to have made an offer to the Samajwadi Party to take initiative for forming a formidable non-Congress and non-BJP coalition in Uttar Pradesh to take on the challenges thrown by the BSP-BJP coalition.

Talks are already on with Dr Sone Lal Patelâ€™s three-member Apna Dal and a few independents who are against the BSP-BJP coalition. Kalyan is learnt to have held talks with Patel and conveyed it to SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav to include him in the third front in the state.

Although Mulayam Singh Yadav has yet to open his cards, sources in the Samajwadi Party claim that â€˜Netajiâ€™ is not averse to regrouping non-Congress opposition parties to take on his bete noire Mayawati.

The SP already has an alliance with the two-member CPM and with the RKP and the Apna Dal would not only increase its tally in the assembly but, importantly, would unite backwards under the new alliance. Both the RKP and the Apna Dal have sizeable support of Lodhs and Kurmis, the two other influential backward castes after Yadavs in the state.

Observers, however, term this realignment as a natural outcome, more due to political compulsions than for any significant change in stateâ€™s polity.

10,Forest employees protest transfers,"PATIALA: The Punjab Non-Gazetted Forest Officersâ€™ Union today took out a protest rally in Sirhind-the home town of Punjab forest minister Harbans Lal. The rally was against the recent transfers in the department and the protesters alleged that there was some ulterior behind these transfers.

Later, they also submitted a memorandum to the minister in which the union opposed the posting of Swarn Singh as conservator of Bist circle, Jallandhar.Accusing him of being an anti-employee officer, the union cautioned the minister that if his posting orders were not cancelled, the employees of Jallandhar circle would proceed on a mass leave from May 13.

The minister informed them that Swarn Singh had been posted there by the chief minister and he would convey their feelings to them.

He urged them not to interfere in the transfers as this was a routine exercise. He said that government was fully aware of their problems.

He assured the union leaders that no officers would be allowed to harass any employee. Jagdeep Singh Dhillon, president of the union, said that only those employees had been transferred, who had initiated action to get the encroached land vacated from the forest mafia.

He said that the union had only one-point agenda of providing protection to the honest and maintaining the seniority in gazetted or non-gazetted cadre.

According to him, Swarn Singh was responsible for the dismissal of many employees and alleged that due to his high handedness two employees had committed suicide. He further said that just after joining he had transferred 12 union leaders and reverted six employees without any notice.

The union demanded that out of the 22 posts of project officers, 13 should be filled from the department and rest by new recruits.He alleged that MD of the forest corporation was trying to protect all the new recruits.

11,Afghan minister to lead convoy through Pak,"AMRITSAR:Though there are many Taliban and Al Qaida activists taking shelter in Pakistan and being supported by countryâ€™s premier intelligence agency Inter Services Intelligence (ISI), Afghanistanâ€™s deputy transport minister Sayed Saadi Mutafaquir has decided to lead a convey of 25 buses from India to Afghanistan, passing through Pakistan under tight security.

This was informed by the minister himself while talking to Times of India here on Monday.The convey will leave on Tuesday and reach its destination Kabul after traversing a distance of 1,300 kilometres. Another batch of 25 buses from India would be dispatched after about 45 days, he added.

Mutafaquir, who had been the political advisor to Ahmed Shah Masood of Northern Alliance, said that Pakistan government had given its assurance for their safe passage to Afghanistan. But he feared the hiding Taliban and Al Qaida ultras who, he believed, were being led by none other than Osama bin Laden. The minister said that he had met the concerned Pakistani authorities at Wagha Border on Saturday who assured him to provide full security cover to the convey.

When asked about the whereabouts of Mullaha Mehmood Omar, Taliban chief and Osama, the minister said that US-led forces were trying to trace them but there might be a possibility of them hiding somewhere between Pakistan and Afghanistan.

Talking about Parvez Musharaffâ€™s approach towards Afghan government, he said that they would rather wait and see his reaction towards Afghan government and its people.When asked about the existence of various small but powerful groups in Afghanistan, he said that once a popular government took over the reigns of the country after elections such groups would automatically lose their importance. Proudly showing his Pakol (cap), Mutafaquir said that he had worn the same Pakol when they had fought with Russian forces,Taliban and Al Qaida outfits to uproot them from their territory and said that no such forces would ever dare to disrupt Afghanistan any more.

He said that the moment his country got another aircraft other than the existing one, his government would consider starting a flight to Amritsar.

12,"MC polls: SAD, SGPC, BJP join hands","CHANDIGARH: Alliances between political parties with different ideologies to achieve common goal are not new to politics.The story of SAD president Parkash Singh Badal and former SGPC chief Gurcharan Singh Tohra spewing venom against each other for quite some time now is also not new.

But, what is new is their party leaders deciding join hands in Patiala to put up a united front against the Congress in the coming Municipal Corporation elections. Not only that, even the BJP, in its political expediency, has joined hands with the Tohra faction. The Tohra loyalist, Surjit Kohli, would be the key liaison person to co-ordinate between the three political parties.

SHSAD general secretary Prem Singh Chandumajra said that there was nothing wrong in forging such alliances at the local level.

He said that the municipal elections were purely a local affair and the party leaders should let the local leaders settle it between themselves. He denied that it was precursor to the Badal-Tohra unity at the state level.

In Jalandhar and Ludhiana, BJP, SAD and BSP would be joining hands to contest against the Congress. BSP had, otherwise, allied with Panthic Morcha in the last Vidhan Sabha elections.

Meanwhile, the BJP state election committee at a meeting here on Monday, cleared the names of its candidates for Patiala, Ludhiana and Amritsar corporations. Twenty-nine each candidates have been declared for Amritsar and Ludhiana corporations whereas 14 for Patiala.

The state election commission announced through a notification on Monday that nomination papers for the elections to the corporations could be filed till May 9.

13,"SAD, BJP, BSP criticise Punjab govt","JALANDHAR:That a new forum to attack the present state government has emerged was much too evident from the conglomeration of various political parties that used the same language and platform to criticise the Amarinder Singh government, on Monday.

The occasion was the culmination of the month long protest programme launched by the Ajit group of newspapers all over the state â€œagainst the discriminatory and revengeful attitude of the government of Punjab towards the Punjabi newspaper Ajit and its chief editor, Barjinder Singh Hamdard.â€�

The newspaper is perturbed over the fact that â€œthe chief minister has imposed a total ban on the release of government advertisements to the Ajit group of publications since the very day of his assuming office. Even the personal security of the chief editor has been curtailed to bare minimum.â€�

The memorandum, which was handed over to the deputy commissioner to be presented before the governor by the representatives of political parties, says,â€œThe present government is harassing the institution in many other ways,â€� without elaborating the point.

The speakers at the rally, supposed to be a platform of the Ajit from which the protest was to be culminated, represented mainly Akali Dal, BJP and the new entrant to the alliance, the BSP.

Those present to support the Ajit group of newspapers were prominent Akali leaders like former SGPC chief Bibi Jagir Kaur, MLA Charanjit Singh Atwal, former Vidhan Sabha Speaker Ajit Singh Kohar, MLA and former minister of jails Jagdish Singh Garcha.

The BJP was represented by Suresh Sehgal and Tikshan Sood, who retained his Hoshiarpur seat.

To complete the quorum, the BSPâ€™s Pawan Tinnu, who contested the Jalandhar South seat, Punjab BSP youth wing president JL Nahar and Avtar Singh Kareempuri were present.

Speaking on the occasion, Barjinder Singh Hamdard, said, â€œOur paper is synonymous with Punjabiat and Punjabi. So by denying us advertisement he is attacking Punjabiat.

Amarinder Singh should forget it if he thinks he can force us to deviate from our path. We do not want government advertisements.

We donâ€™t need alms. As far as reporting goes we were most unbiased in reporting the recent Assembly elections. Protest rallies were held in 54 towns of Punjab and this goes to prove that the entire state is disturbed over the issue.â€� Bibi Jagir Kaur said, â€œIf Amarinder continues to take revenge against Ajit he is inviting trouble.â€�

14,Red Cross protests symbol misuse,"PUNE: The city unit of the Indian Red Cross Society has appealed to medical institutions, hospitals, dispensaries, private practitioners, pharmacists and other institutions to stop misusing the Red Cross sign.

The society said many medical establishments were found to be illegally using the Red Cross sign (a red-coloured cross), which, it said, was a copyright of the Red Cross Society.

Doctors are supposed to use the multi-coloured â€œAesculpaian staffâ€� symbol, drug manufacturers and pharmacists a green cross, while hospitals a bold white â€œHâ€� with blue background, the society said, in a statement released by R.V.Kulkarni, secretary of the societyâ€™s Pune unit.

The release further said both, the International Red Cross Society and its Indian arm had decided to observe 2002-2003 as an year for creating awareness about the Red Cross sign.The society will take out an awareness rally in the city to mark World Red Cross Day on May 8, the release said.

Kulkarni pointed out that the Geneva agreement signed on August 12, 1949, had given legal rights to individual countries to stop the misuse of the Red Cross sign.The Indian government banned the use of the sign by establishments other than the Red Cross Society in 1960. The directorgeneral of health has also instructed drug manufacturers to stop using the sign, but its misuse continues, Kulkarni rued. â€œThis is largely because many institutions are still not aware of the legal restrictions,â€� he said.

The society will also launch a special drive from May 8 to create awareness among people about the misuse of the sign.

15,YSR sticks to offer of free power to farmers,"ONGOLE: Congress Legislature Party leader Y S Rajasekhara Reddy on Monday disagreed with e c o n o m i s t M o h a n Guruswamyâ€™s statement on free power and reiterated his assurance of free power to farmers if the Congress came to power in the state.

The CLP leader, addressing party workers at the Congress camp here on Monday, said Guruswamy was toeing the line of the state government.

Later, speaking to reporters at the R&B guest house, Reddy said that the party had taken a stand on the supply of free power after duly consulting the high-command and there was no need to doubt the credentials of the party.

He said the situation of the farmers in the state was alarming. He said even the NDA government had confirmed that three out of four farmers in the state were suffering because of various problems.

The CLP leader, explaining on the possibility of free power to farmers, said that the government would incur only Rs 250-300 crore loss on free power to farmers as the state government was already extending Rs 1,500 crore cross subsidy on power in the state.

Extending Rs 300 crore more relief to the farmers would not be a burden on the exchequer if the plight of the farmers was taken into account.

Answering to another query, he said that demanding the state governmentâ€™s resignation was not the partyâ€™s stand. The party had done its job perfectly to awaken the sleeping government, he said adding that the Congress party had even submitted a memorandum to the National Human Rights Commission on the predicament of the farmers.

Rajasekhara Reddy criticised chief minister Chandrababu Naidu for not coming forward to the rescue of farmers in the state who were resorting to suicides because of mounting debts.

The input costs on the farm produce have increased abnormally and the state government has failed to implement the minimum support price resulting in doubling the woes of the farmers, he said.

Reddy alleged that the chief minister had deceived the minorities by abstaining from the Lok Sabha when the censure motion on Gujarat was put to vote.

17,ONGC incurring Rs 75 cr every day,"RAJAHMUNDRY: Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) is incurring Rs 75 crore loss per day as the central government was not compensating corporation on a par with international market rates, according to ONGC human resources director Jauhari Lal.

Speaking to reporters on Monday, Lal said that Union petroleum minister Ram Naik took up the matter with Union finance minister Yashwant Sinha and a decision was expected soon. The recent changes in the administrative price mechanism (APM) had also caused some effect and it would take some more time to settle down, he felt.

Lal said that the corporation was experiencing several changes like corporate restructuring as per the guidelines of the McKinsey report. Delegation of powers to the local authorities, accountability and responsibility were some of the objectives of the corporate restructuring, he said.

Lal said that the ONGC had spent Rs 4,000 crore so far in the Krishna Godavari (KG) basin since 1979 and paid royalty and sales tax to the state government. He said that under the its socio-economic development plan, the ONGC was spending Rs 4 crore every year for the development of roads, besides taking up health and infrastructure development in the schools.

18,Health policy pops privatisation pill,"NEW DELHI: A new health policy promulgated after 20 years by the Union government has been criticised as just another step towards privatisation without ensuring delivery.

The policy proposes user charges at district level hospitals, but public health activists say the experience in other countries shows that health gains are directly proportional to the investment made in public health.

Privatisation does not produce the desired results. So, Sri Lanka, where over 45 per cent of spending is through the government, has managed to bring the infant mortality rate down to 16, even though the aggregate spending is less than that of India.

The policy, suggests revamping of primary health centres (PHCs) by involving the private sector as well as through compulsory posting of doctors in rural areas.

While calling for strengthening of the primary health infrastructure, the policy says resources could be generated by levying user charges for certain services in the secondary and tertiary sector of health care for those who can afford to pay.

Critics of the policy say that this is very unlikely to workbecause it is difficult to determine those who can and pay and those who cannot. The result in such a situation is that those in dire need of the public health system are invariably excluded.

â€˜â€˜There is enough experience to show that it gets to be very difficult in practice to distinguish between who can pay and who cannot. The poor invariably get left out. The public distribution system should provide an example of how such a system operates in our country,â€™â€™ says Amit Sen Gupta, member of Jan Swasthya Abhiyan, a citizenâ€™s group.

â€˜â€˜Global experience of user fee any any level shows that they serve only one purposeâ€”to drive out the poor and the indigent,â€™â€™ adds Sen Gupta.

Another public health specialist D Banerjee, adds, â€˜â€˜In any country where health care systems are efficient, 80 per cent of the costs are borne by the government.â€™â€™

While the emphasis on primary health centres is laudable, say these experts, it should not be at the expense of other sectors.

They also sound a note of caution with regard to the proposal for encouraging private participation in running of PHCs.

It is also important, they say, that the government should not abandon its stated objective in the 1983 Health Policy of providing health care through a comprehensive system of primary health centres.

â€˜â€˜We continue to have a poor health infrastructure, where more money is spent on salaries, than in providing any health care,â€™â€™ says Banerjee.

â€˜â€˜A health policy should address all these needs, instead of being a just a gimmick,â€™â€™ he says. Moreover, what about implementation: Is it going to go the way of the 1983 policy, he asks.",NEW DELHI

""There is no security of life in the state, no relief, no food and no medication. If the victims want to return to their homes from the relief camps, they are killed while their houses are taken over by Sangh Parivar hordes,"" Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav and CPI-M leader Somnath Chatterjee told reporters after an hour-long breakfast meeting at the latter''s residence.

The meeting was attended by leaders in Parliament of Left parties, the Nationalist Congress Party, the JD (S), the IUML and the Samajwadi Party.

Ram Vilas Paswan''s Lok Janshakti Party, which recently broke ties with the NDA on this issue, was represented by its senior MP, Capt Jai Narayan Nishad. Former Prime Minister H D Deve Gowda was also present in the meeting.

Chatterjee said, ""We will coordinate our efforts in both Houses of Parliament and ask the government to what extent have they implemented Article 355. We have our doubts. Inhuman conditions are prevailing in the state.""

20,"Goa tourism hit by Gujarat violence, Afghan turmoil","DUBAI: Hit by Gujarat violence and fighting in Afghanistan, Goa is planning roadshows in the Gulf countries to attract Arab tourists, according to a senior tourism official.

""Fifteen percent of domestic tourists to Goa are from Gujarat and there has been a dip in arrivals from the trouble-torn state recently,"" Goa Tourism Director N Suryanarayana said on Tuesday at the Arabian travel market exhibition here.

Arabs, faced with tighter security checks in the Western countries, could be wooed to make Goa their preferred destination, Suryanarayana said.

Suryanarayana said foreign tourist arrivals fell at least ten per cent last year down from three lakhs in 2000-2001 to 2.65 lakhs the next year. Even though Goa was more than 2500 kms away from Afghanistan, many foreign tourists dropped plans to visit the state fearing security problems.

Chartered tourist flights recorded 40 per cent drop after September last year but were ""showing signs of revival"", Joao Xavier Miranda, Director of Cicerone Air Transport Services, Margoa, said.

21,HC drops contempt case against Rabri govt,"PATNA: The Rabri Devi government heaved a sigh of relief with the Patna High Court on Tuesday dropping a contempt case against it.

The Bihar government was facing contempt proceedings against it for disobeying an earlier High Court order for payment of dues worth around Rs 1.18 crore to the teachers and non-teaching staff of SPM college at Udantpuri in Nalanda district.

Justice Radha Mohan Prasad recalled his order of serving contempt notice on the state cabinet when the Advocate General Shashi Anugraha Narayan informed the bench that the state government had already decided to clear the dues.

""There might have been some communication gap earlier but I wish to impress upon the court that the government has promptly responded to clear the dues of the college as directed by the court"", Narayan said.

The case was listed for hearing before the bench on Tuesday.

22,Jaswant rules out external observers for J&K polls,"NEW DELHI: Rejecting European Union''s stand on Gujarat, the government on Tuesday asserted in the Rajya Sabha that India will not accept prescriptions from outside on internal matters and ruled out presence of outside observers in the coming Assembly elections in Jammu and Kashmir.

""India will not accept prescriptions to do this or that. We did not accept them in 1998 (after the nuclear tests). India will not accept being spoken to from assumed positions of superiority or greater morality,"" External Affairs Minister Jaswant Singh said replying to a debate on the working of his ministry.

Singh was responding to concerns expressed by members regarding the statements made by EU in the wake of Gujarat violence.

On British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw''s reported remarks on positioning of outside observers for Jammu and Kashmir Assembly elections, Singh clarified that the import of Straw''s comments was not that he suggested presence of such observers, but made it clear that India, in any case, rejected such a notion totally.

""There is no question of accepting any outside observers during Jammu and Kashmir polls. The issue is entirely in the domain of the Election Commission,"" the minister said, adding New Delhi has made it abundantly clear that Jammu and Kashmir issue has to be resolved bilaterally between India and Pakistan.

""There is no change in that position nor can there by any dilution of that position,"" he said.

23,Governor raps officials for delay in surveying riot victims,"GANDHINAGAR: Taking strong exception to the prevailing lethargy in surveying the damages suffered by the riot victims, Gujarat Governor S S Bhandari told top officials on Monday that the work ought to be completed ""most urgently"".

A top Raj Bhawan source quoted the Governor as telling the officials that the survey should be the ""precursor to providing a liberal package to those who have suffered, enabling their early return to their houses.""

At a meeting here, the governor, who heads the all-party committee on relief camps, told the officials that there should be no target-based approach to close down the relief camps, as was sought in some districts. Taking a formal review three weeks after a similar meeting was held, he emphasised, however, the need to assess the ""position of the inmates and their willingness to go back and resettle at their old places of living."" He instructed the officials to provide ""all necessary facilities, particularly security arrangements, for those who wished to return to their homes.""

Bhandari particularly stressed that there should be ""no complacency in reviewing the cases where specific complaints of under-assessment came."" He told the district collectors of Ahmedabad, Vadodara, Sabarkantha, Panchmahals and Mehsana to ""individually attend to the problem"".

Based on complaints, the Governor''s personal intervention in Sabarkantha ensured a large-scale resurvey in the entire district and re-disbursement of cheques. Those who had received a mere Rs 200 against house damages, on a resurvey received anywhere between Rs 12,000 to Rs 32,000.

Suggesting that such resurveys make rehabilitation of the riot victims easier, Bhandari particularly showed concern about why out of the 23 riot-affected areas of Ahmedabad, the survey had been completed in just 12 areas. He was told, in the presence of chief secretary G Subba Rao and the officials heading revenue and home departments, collectors and the officials in charge of the affected districts, that so far 8,000 riot-affected families had filled up claim forms in Ahmedabad. Of these, 6,638 cases had been surveyed.

However, officials admitted, so far the survey of the worst-affected areas of Ahmedabad - Naroda-Patia and Saijpur-Patia - had not begun. The reason given was that these were ""more complicated"". Similarly, in other more-affected areas, Isanpur, Ghodasar, Chamanpura (Gulmarg Society), Odhav, Kochrab and Naroda, the survey began only two days back. Setback to surveys in Ahmedabad took place after two teams were attacked in Behrampura. Now, the survey work has resumed with the teams being provided adequate security.

As on Monday, the number of people living in 49 relief camps in Ahmedabad were 59,935. The governor was told, because of the ""dynamic situation of uncertainty"" prevailing in the city, nearly 25,000 people had left the camps over the last 45 days, with nearly as many re-entering them. The number of camps is also not coming down because of the same reason. He was told that livelihood issues were being tackled ""wherever necessary"" with the help of the district industrial centre.

The survey in Ahmedabad has identified 2,330 families as beneficiaries in Rakhial, 837 in Rajpur-Hirpur Chaura in the railway station area, 647 in Sheherkotda, 461 in Asarva, 719 in Danilimda, 616 in Behrampura, 510 in Dariapur-Kazipur, 214 in Vasna, 108 in Vejalpur, and about 1,700 in the Ramol-Vatva-Jantanagar area. The camp managers have been asked to see that those who have left the camps fill up their forms in time. There are around 1,900 such families, the governor was told.

24,BJP wants party man in Speaker's chair,"NEW DELHI: With the BJP keen to avoid a contest for the Speaker''s post, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pramod Mahajan was kept busy by a flurry of meetings on Tuesday. A decision on who the BJP will field as the candidate is expected on Wednesday.

Mahajan met Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee in the morning and followed it up with a meeting with Congress President Sonia Gandhi, where names of likely candidates were discussed. He is also believed to be in touch with NDA allies.

After ally Telugu Desam Party decided not to accept the Speakership in protest on the Gujarat issue, the BJP is lobbying hard to get its own candidate elected. It is also keen that the Speaker is elected unanimously.

The names doing the rounds by Tuesday evening were those of BJP ministers Ram Naik, Jagmohan and Shanta Kumar and party chief whip in the Lok Sabha V K Malhotra, apart from Shiv Sena Minister Manohar Joshi. Another name being mentioned in some quarters is that of veteran BJP leader Laxmi Narayan Pandey.

Mahajan, after meeting the PM, said, ""We expect to complete the process of naming the candidate latest by tomorrow."" Malhotra, who is also BJP spokesman, confirmed that talks on the issue were on, ""within the BJP, with NDA allies and with Opposition leaders.""

The move to get the Opposition to agree to a consensus candidate began with Mahajan meeting Sonia. The Congress said after the meeting that it did not have reservations as yet on any name discussed. But it did not rule out fielding its own candidate although spokesman Abhishek Singhvi said the party would favour a consensus.

""It has been a consistent Congress stand that, as far as possible, election to the post of Speaker should be by consensus,"" Singhvi said. He, however, added that consultations were only in the initial stage, and although several names were discussed by Mahajan and Sonia, no details were finalised yet.

Political observers say floating so many names is a tactical BJP move to push the candidate it wants as Speaker while ensuring it is eventually a consensus choice.

A Shiv Sena candidate, for instance, will instantly be rejected by the Congress. The inclusion of Manohar Joshi''s name, thus, is seen as a move to make the BJP leaders appear more palatable to the main Opposition party.

Of the other names, while Petroleum Minister Ram Naik and Tourism Minister Jagmohan seem to be front runners as of now, Malhotra could be the dark horse, say observers.

An NDA leader said: ""The BJP is keen on Malhotra, but knows that pushing a hardliner like him could raise some hackles. But allies are unlikely to oppose them on this issue.""

Opposition leaders say that Jagmohan, known to go by the book on most matters, will be the most acceptable face to them from among those in the reckoning. But many within the BJP are said to believe that he could on occasion prove an uncomfortable proposition for the ruling party itself.

Ram Naik, meanwhile, on Tuesday sought to scotch rumours that he was reluctant to leave a ministerial post for the Speakership. The veteran Maharashtra leader said: ""Whatever responsibility is given to me by the party, I will accept it.""

Naik said Vajpayee, Home Minister L K Advani and Mahajan would decide on the issue. Nominations for the Speaker''s post close at noon on May 9 and elections are slated for May 10. The Speaker''s post fell vacant following the death of G M C Balayogi in a helicopter crash in March.

Both Balayogi and Deputy Speaker P M Sayeed were elected unanimously.

25,Many in Hurriyat keen on fighting elections in J&K,"SRINAGAR: The All-Party Hurriyat Conference, an amalgam of 23 separatist groups is yet to formally announce its participation in the forthcoming Jammu and Kashmir Assembly polls.

Serious differences are cropping up over the issue, said sources. While the declining band of hardliners still wait for a nod from Pakistan, almost the entire middle-level Hurriyat leadership is prepared to contest the polls. Five of the seven executive members of the conglomerate too favour participation in the polls.

Of late, the Jamiat-e-Islami, the dominant constituent of the Hurriyat, said it was not averse to joining the poll fray following increasing US encouragement. Gulam Mohammad Bhat, chief of Jamiat, feels that the assembly elections need to be taken seriously if the present stalemate is to end and the separatist groups are to assert their presence in the Valley. The Hurriyat, he said, has already been informed of the Jamiat stand.

Bhat, however, is not keen to rock the boat. Despite his pro-poll stand, he was careful to add that the collective decision of the Hurriyat would be acceptable. But the Jamiat, too, has its share of hardliners.

Syed Ali Shah Geelani, who represents Jamiat in the Hurriyat, has been isolated on the issue of participation in polls.

After his 10-year stint in the state assembly, Geelani became disillusioned when in 1987, elections were reportedly manipulated by the ruling National Conference.

Polls, feels Geelani, are no solution for the imbroglio. A permanent solution can only emerge from tripartite talks involving India, Pakistan and the Kashmiri people.

But there are few takers for the stand. Several Hurriyat leaders suggested that the restoration of greater autonomy to Jammu and Kashmir should be sufficient for the separatist groups to participate in the polls.

The Jamiat officially disowned Geelaniâ€™s views last week, terming them his personal opinion.

The Hurriyat, according to sources, has also asked Jamiat chief Gulam Mohammad Bhat to remove Abdul Khaliq Bhat from the conglomerate.

In the absence of Geelani it is Khaliq who represents the Jamiat in the Hurriyat. Khaliq, according to sources, too, holds some extreme views about the political dispensation for Jammu and Kashmir other than the right to self-determination.

26,Congress criticises foreign policy,"NEW DELHI: The Congress on Tuesday attacked the government in the Rajya Sabha for its conduct of foreign policy.

Minister for external affairs Jaswant Singh was accused of discarding the Nehruvian legacy, succumbing to US pressure and not adequately using the vast reservoir of talent available with the Indian Foreign Service.

â€˜â€˜I donâ€™t think the US respects any nation that doesnâ€™t stand up to it,â€™â€™ said Congressâ€™ Natwar Singh, pointing out that the recently-appointed ambassador at large in the US, B K Agnihotri, declined his government post because he wanted to retain his US green card.

Natwar Singh also alleged that Prime Minister Vajpayee broke his oath of secrecy by referring to earlier Prime Ministersâ€™ decision on nuclear tests.

In a discussion on â€˜â€˜the working of the ministry of external affairsâ€™â€™, the former diplomat linked the domestic politics to its consequences on the diplomatic front, saying that 57 Islamic nations are keenly watching the developments in Gujarat.

He accused the government of putting the lives and earnings of 40 lakh Indians living in the Gulf in jeopardy with the incidents of Gujarat.

â€˜â€˜If the fire of Gujarat spreads, the four million people will be asked to leave.â€™â€™ He said the government had even allowed former US president Clinton to refer to Kashmir as a disputed territory in his speech in Parliamentâ€™s Central Hall while the Prime Minister sat next to him.

27,Mob attacks ambulances carrying riot victims,"AHMEDABAD: The myth of VS Hospital being a safe haven for Muslim patients lay shattered as a mob attacked two ambulances carrying victims and stabbed a 22-year-old youth, who was accompanying his brother injured in police firing.

The ambulances were carrying two dead and two injured in the rioting at Juhapura. â€˜â€˜They are killing our people...they should not be treated here,â€™â€™ the mob reportedly shouted, blocking the way of the ambulances.

â€˜â€˜I got down from the ambulance thinking that the people had come to help the patients. As soon as I stepped out, they started beating me and one of them also slashed me on the neck,â€™â€™ a victim told Times News Network, showing the neck injury. The victim escaped and hid in a toilet in an adjoining building.

While one of the ambulances retracted and admitted the patients in one Riaz hospital in Juhapura, patients in the other ambulance fled to Kagdiwad. â€˜â€˜From there, we called a Congress leader who arranged for us to go back to the hospital safely,â€™â€™ said a person who was accompanying his nephewâ€™s body who was killed in police firing in Juhapura.

Hospital sources said that tension prevailed in the atmosphere since morning when in a meeting of NGOs and the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) officials, one of the representatives accused the doctors of being communally biased. â€˜â€˜The leader accused the doctors of being communally biased and deliberately amputating limbs,â€™â€™ conceded a senior official.

â€˜â€˜The representative made that point, but his intention was not to accuse. What he was saying was that misgivings might exist when the patients feel that their hands or feet could have been saved and would not consent with the doctorâ€™s judgment which is more informed. So there is need to build a rapport between the patients and the hospital staff,â€™â€™ said senior Gandhian Chunibhai Vaidya who attended the meeting.

The comment nevertheless led to a ruckus when one of the senior most AMC officials accompanied by doctors staged a walkout and a group of people stormed into the room and threatened the representative.

While the situation was saved, there was lot of unrest among the hospital staff when one of the AMC safai-karamcharis, who was stabbed in Jamalpur, was brought in the hospital. Leader of Ahmedabad Municipal Servants Association Dinkar Bhatt is believed to have raised the question of safety of the corporation employees while working in Muslim-dominated areas.

The attack on the ambulances happened when the one shift of the hospital employees had ended and workers had gathered in the hospital compound. â€˜â€˜Most of the mob was from outside but some of the hospital employees who were annoyed since morning also joined in,â€™â€™ informed a hospital source.

Resident medical officer of the hospital Dinesh Chandana said the incident was sparked off by outsiders but immediately brought under control. â€˜â€˜There is no tension. The mob was immediately dispersed. We have been looking after the patients well.â€™â€™

28,Official panel sweeps Asiatic polls,"KOLKATA: The official panel swept all 20 seats for the council of members election held at the 128-year-old Asiatic Society of Bengal, in Kolkata, on Monday.
