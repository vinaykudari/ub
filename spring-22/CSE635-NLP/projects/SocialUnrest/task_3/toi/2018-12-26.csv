0,Manipur asked to ensure fair polls,"new delhi: home minister advani has asked the authorities in manipur, now under president's rule, to ensure that the forthcoming elections to the assembly are ''terror-free''. ''the ensuing elections should be held in a terror-free atmosphere so that candidates can campaign without any fear...all efforts should be made to ensure this; and the centre would provide whatever help required,'' advani said, while inaugurating the new manipur government guest house here. re-asserting that the integrity of manipur or any other north-eastern state would be maintained at all costs, advani said, ''we will speak to insurgent groups to establish peace in the region, but in no way take a decision which would harm the integrity of any state.'' stating that the government was now faced with the major task of battling terrorism, he said this fight was ''not directed against any community, organisation or any country''. ''our prime objective in order to achieve good governance is to ensure a terror-free atmosphere for all citizens, whether they are in jammu and kashmir or in any other part of the country,'' advani said. referring to the situation in punjab in the '80s during which extremism touched its peak, he said, ''we used to wonder whether this situation will ever change. but see today, the state has come out of the darkness and prospering.'' he said he hoped a similar situation would emerge in manipur after the assembly elections and the new government would provide much-required financial and political stability to the state. manipur governor ved marwah said the problems of insurgency and financial crisis had ''developed over the years'' and long- and short-term measures were required to bring the state out of the rut. marwah said that ''insurgency has eaten into the vitals of the whole foundation of the state, while the financial situation has remained critical for long.'' he sought the centre's help in bringing the state out of the critical situation.

1,"MCDâ€™s 1,100 new toilets include 450 old ones","new delhi: at stake is rs 164 crore. the task at hand is to complete over 1,100 community toilet complexes. and with three months to go before the deadline and construction caught up in land ownership wrangles, mcd officials are worried that they may have to forfeit funds promised by the japan bank for international cooperation. the construction of 1,146 community toilet complexes is being funded by the japanese bank under a time-bound project to be completed by march 31, 2002. failing to complete the construction of 1,146 ctcs, mcd stand to lose rs 164 crore in allotted funds promised by jbic. since august, when mcd got this project, work has actually started on about 750 of the total target. out of this, over 450 are being constructed after demolishing existing toilet complexes. mcd engineer-in-chief deepak mukhopadhyay, who is handling some 700 ctcs of the 1,146, admitted that mcd is having trouble identifying the sites. ''the mcd can construct only on the sites available to it,'' mukhopadhyay said. however, mcd commissioner s p aggarwal had earlier said the project is in fact a challenge for the mcd. ''i have full faith and confidence that the corporation would complete the 1,146 ctcs in time,'' aggarwal said. but officials wonder how. for one, there is not enough land and besides, time is running out. but aggarwal, who is personally monitoring the project, said work is already on a fast track. the finance department had cleared proposals worth rs 140 crore related to the project. additional commissioner (engineering) vishnu sharma said most of the projects are already on. ''the only problem mcd faces is on disputed sites,'' sharma said. elaborating on ''disputed sites'', another mcd official of the engineering wing said about 250 such sites finalised for construction are disputed land. leader of opposition in mcd ram babu sharma cited one example. ''one such construction is taking place on a piece of land earmarked for a graveyard in sabholi, shahdara (north). the site is caught in a dispute between dda and the waqf board,'' ram babu said. an mcd official, requesting anonymity, said even among the 975 sites finalised till date for construction of ctcs, about 70 belong to other departments from whom clearance has to be sought for construction. ''how much time that would take, i can not say,'' the official said. he said: ''the dda would not give them land as most of them are disputed. the gram sabha would not support them either as delhi government would not allow it. already about 150 of the sites are facing public resistance.'' mukhopadhayay admitted that the residents are already up in arms against toilets being constructed in their vicinity. ''no one wants a toilet block in front of their house or a park. so we are now constructing in the corner spaces or wherever practically feasible,'' mukhopadhyay said. but the point remains: how many ctcs would actually come into being? as the mcd official himself admitted, of the 750 being constructed, about 450 of them are on existing sites. most of the older complexes are being demolished to be replaced by new ones. ''the thrust is on meeting the deadline and achieving the target number,'' ram babu said. and getting the promised funds.

3,"We oppose disinvestment, says Agashe","pune: although highly-placed sources within the film and television institute (ftii) here claim that the union ministry of information and broadcasting has called for the financial evaluation of the institute, ftii director dr mohan agashe said he was not aware of any official communique in this regard. while acknowledging that the disinvestment proposal of the geetakrishnan committee had been a subject of discussion between the ftii and the ministry authorities, agashe asserted: ""we have made it clear that we are against any such move."" established in 1961, the ftii's most lucrative asset, running into tens of crores of rupees, is its prime real estate of 47 acres in pune's upmarket prabhat road area. the expenditure reforms commission, headed by former finance secretary k.p. geetakrishnan, had recommended in its final report last year that both the ftii and the kolkata-based satyajit ray film and television institute ""may be handed over to the film industry"" and that ""the modalities of transfer be worked out to safeguard the government's investments."" agashe pointed out that in october 2000 itself, he had informed the ministry that the geetakrishnan committee's recommendation did not seem feasible. in his letter to the ministry, he had said that while the industry was not ""organised enough"" to take over the ftii, there was a need for ""right-sizing"" of the institute and the modification of recruitment rules for the faculty to ensure proper inflow and outflow of professionals. the government's seriousness on the disinvestment proposal can be gauged from the fact that yet another high-level meeting has been convened by i&b secretary pawan chopra to discuss the recommendations in new delhi on december 28. heads of 20 institutes, including the ftii, have been advised to be present for the meeting. agashe admitted that ftii was facing numerous problems, including an acute shortage of teaching staff. as a result, it had been forced to postpone admissions by at least three months. ""apart from a backlog of 64 students, we have selected 40 students for fresh admissions. we are unable to start the new academic year till the faculty strength improves,"" he said. agashe regretted that over the years, the i&b ministry had ignored various recommendations made by the previous committees to improve the infrastructure and finances of ftii. ""the institute would not have come to such a pass had at least some of these recommendations been accepted,"" he said.

4,Remove agriculture minister: Goma,"dharamsala: kangra district congress committee (dcc) president milkhi ram goma said, here, on monday, that the state agriculture minister should not be allowed to continue in office, since he was ''inactive and unable'' to manage the affairs of his ministry. blaming the agriculture ministry, he told mediapersons that the farmers of the kangra district had been given poor quality wheat seed, which could severely affect production. ''the potato seeds are also in short supply, forcing farmers to buy them from private agencies at exorbitant prices.this reflects the attitude of the ministry towards the farmers,'' he said. goma said that the abolition of the subsidy on fertilisers would also affect the economic condition of the farmers. the dcc president criticised the dhumal government for considering downsizing of the agriculture department. ''he seems to have forgotten that nearly 666 graduates pass out every year from the himachal pradesh agriculture university at palampur and the horticulture university at solan,'' goma said. the dhumal government, he added, has failed in providing jobs to the scheduled castes and tribes of the state. he said that the kangra district had been discriminated against as far as development was concerned. the cause, he said, was the ''tug of war'' between the dhumal and shanta kumar factions.

6,â€˜Nawada admn flouted govt directivesâ€™,"patna: had the nawada district and police administration followed the instructions of the home commissioner and deployed armed force at the jail gate, there would have been no escape of prisoners on sunday, said minister of state for jail ashok chaudhary. he said that the district police did a commendable job by gunning down some of the eight escaping criminals, for which policemen deserve kudos and gallantry awards. but their action came after the jail-break incident, he added. in one of the meetings of the jail department held under the leadership of home commissioner u n panjiyar last year itself, it had been decided to tighten the security in all the jails of the state, particularly in those central and district jails, which had been declared sensitive due to presence of hardcore criminals lodged there. it was decided to deploy one company each of armed police force to prevent possibility of any escape by prisoners and accordingly instructions had been sent to all the districts. but while some of the districts followed the instruction and deployed armed force, others ignored it and nawada district administration was one among the second category of the districts, the minister said. chaudhary also stated that when a large number of bmp and crpf could be deployed to nab hardcore criminal ashok mahto, it was the duty of the district and the police administration to provide proper security to the nawada jail gate to thwart any bid to escape, since mahto had been lodged there. had it been done so, mahto would have thought twice before making any escape bid, he added. jails of the state are not taken seriously by the district and the police administration. the administration becomes active only when some incident takes place. it is not possible for one armed guard on duty in each jail to prevent any mass attempt of escape or resort to any violence inside the jail, he stated. he, however, did not rule out the possibility of the complicity of the jail staff, including jail superintendent, in the incident and said that would be clear after the inquiry into it.

8,Politicians bless homeguard polls,"patna: it was a different experience for the city police as they went about the task of conducting a 'peaceful' election for the district unit of bihar homeguard jawans' union here on tuesday. the police faced a serious 'threat' to law and order on the premises of police line under the buddha colony police station during the election even though the voters were the part of same force which is responsible for holding peaceful elections elsewhere. about 3,000 homeguard jawans from different parts of the district gathered in the police line to cast their votes. most of them were brought in the vehicles provided by the candidates. there were several tents installed on the ground. the jawans formed a long queue to receive the ballot papers while armed constables kept a tight vigil on the ballot boxes. many political figures, including rjd leader ashok yadav, were seen busy in soliciting support for their candidates. the buddha colony police was busy in watching 'unknown' faces present near the election site. the tension was palpable. the election has its own importance for the patna police. in city, a large number of homeguard jawans are engaged for maintaining law and order since the number of constables in district armed police is not sufficient for this purpose. it is also a fact that the district police is not in position to engage all enrolled homeguard jawans in city all the time. this leads to the authorities concerned adopting 'pick and choose' policy. homeguard commandant rana amrendra kumar dipak said the problem of law and order was apprehended because of the presence of a large number of homeguard jawans on the ground.

10,"Criminals are part of politics, says Thakre","lucknow: chief minister rajnath singh and bjp chief kalraj mishra may have said 'no' to criminals, but kushbhau thakre, former bjp national president, minces no words in accepting that criminals are a necessity in a political system. it is a political compulsion to include criminals in the party, he said here on monday. but, in the same vein, he said that still the bjp was better than other political parties. if criminals were there in our party, we had tried to get rid of them, he added. in a freewheeling interview to times news network, thakre, who is also in-charge of up affairs, said: i do not take guarantee that criminals would not be given ticket for the next assembly elections. we will try to eliminate them. but one thing should be borne in mind that no one lives in isolation. we are getting leaders from this society only. and all of them are not sadhus. thakre's remarks comes at time when political leaders of all hues are crying hoarse against criminalisation of politics. samajwadi party had even suspended two of its mps for their criminal antecedents. in politics, said thakre, situations arises when one has to make compromises. the bjp faced a similar situation in 1996 when the former governor romesh bhandari refused to invite the bjp to form government though it was the largest party. we had no option then but to take help of legislators from other parties. a few of them may have had criminal records. we used them to break the political impasse prevailing at that time, he added. and we do not know about future, too, he said and added: so far, criminals are not in the bjp. they may be with our allies. he was obviously referring to ramakant yadav, a noted criminal who joined the janata dal (u) recently. and even thakre shared dais with yadav in azamgarh. not only about criminals, the former bjp chief was also very clear what action should be taken against indisciplined legislators. i do not go by complaints as i know in politics complaints are generally fake, he said and added: it is said that a few bjp legislators had cross voted during rajya sabha polls. but where is the proof. if it is proved in black and white that legislators had cross voted then they would be denied assembly tickets this time. incidentally, former state bjp president om prakash singh, who is also pwd minister in rajnath's cabinet, had said that the culprits had been identified. about prospects of the bjp in the coming elections, thakre said that both the cm and the state bjp chief had infused a new life in the party. party workers are active. they are implementing party programmes at the village level. the party's chalo gaon ki sune programme was a success as bjp leaders came to know about two things â€” one, development work carried out by the government and, second, the work which the government should do. based on this feedback, the government played its mbc reservation card and extended reservation to that section of society which was deprived of reservation benefits, said thakre. thakre, however, was not willing to give numbers the bjp is expected to win in this election. do not ask me now. i can tell you this much that the bjp will form the next government too and rajnath singh would be the chief minister.

12,UP has â€˜minister for underworldâ€™,"lucknow: ever heard of a 'minister for criminal politicians and underworld affairs' in a state cabinet? coined by a senior ips officer during a casual conversation, this undeclared portfolio is not only present but is effectively operational in the state as well. 'sportingly' heading the portfolio is a minister who is himself seen as the state's underworld king or raja, if one prefers hindi. the need for the ministry cropped up in july last after two ganglords of eastern uttar pradesh, mukhtar ansari, mla, and underworld kingpin brijesh singh entered into a bloody gangwar which saw the open use of ak assault rifles in varanasi. fearing a sequel to the bloodbath, in which the police gunner of the mla was shot dead, 'raja' was entrusted the job to head the'ministry' primarily to keep a tab on state underworld. observers in the police force admit that the 'ministry' appears to have delivered the goods in the best possible manner. not only has the 'raja' managed to check further feuds within the underworld but he has also worked out a policy of 'mutual understanding' among the rival underworld groups for their areas of operation. towing the line of a series of panchayats held by chief minister rajnath singh, the 'raja' also held a panchayat of who's who in the state underworld â€” right from representatives of mafia godfathers like dhananjay singh (then in jail) and brijesh singh (now underground). held at the hazratganj residence of the 'raja', the panchayat saw the clear allocation of tenders and contracts in the state to different gangs in order to minimise a clash of interest. other sources of 'revenue' in the underworld were also believed to have been allocated accordingly. those attending the panchayats were even cautioned to keep the guns away, admitted a participant. then came the involvement of a mla in the murder of his driver. known for his proximity to the 'raja', the mla remained elusive from the law till he finally managed to get a stay order on his arrest. the 'raja's' consistency in delivering the goods when it counted most has undoubtedly brought a sigh of relief for the government not only on crime front but on political front as well. ''this has proved more effective than the strict and heightened policing policy over the years,'' a senior police officer also said.

17,ED seeks info on First Global's Mauritius investments,"new delhi: enforcement directorate on wednesday sent letters rogatory to mauritius seeking information about the inward and outward flow of funds from the company owned by shanker sharma, director of the first global, official sources said here on wednesday. the sources said a local court on wednesday approved the letters rogatory of the enforcement directorate sent to the authorities in mauritius asking for information about the funds available in sharma's bank accounts there. they said the agency feared that sharma might have asked the foreign investment institutes (fiis) to deposit the rest of the money gained from the shares of himachal futuristic communication limited (hfcl) to his accounts in mauritius. ed has alleged that sharma's first global had sold nearly 5.92 lakh shares of hfcl to 16 fiis and their sub-account holders without the permission of reserve bank of india. the shares were found to have been purchased at a price of rs 1050 and sold at rs 1060 to fiis while the actual price at the time of selling was ranging between rs 2100 to rs 2211. first global were the lead arrangers for hfcl. the move to issue letters rogatory was initiated after an enforcement directorate team returned empty handed from mauritius where it had gone to bring information relating to 24 companies including first global mentioned by the income tax authorities as having violated the tax norms under the pretext of indo-mauritian double taxation avoidance convention. however, mauritian authorities have made it clear that any suspension of the convention would have serious ramifications on the ties between the two countries. the sources said there were apprehensions that sharma could have asked for depositing the remaining amount of money in his mauritius bank account under the convention. ""the lr seeks the complete details of inward and outward flow of money from his (sharma's) accounts,"" the sources said, adding the balance of his bank accounts could be verified from the profit and loss statement of his companies. the sources said the letters rogatory also sought profit and loss and other accounts of sharma's companies in mauritius to verify his statements here. the reuqest also sought to verify the movement of funds of nearly 16 fiis to whom sharma sold hfcl shares in violation of rbi norms. meanwhile, sharma was taken to mumbai last night after a duty magistrate extended his ed remand by another seven days. the first global shot in light after the tehelka expose on corruption in the defence deals as the company owns 14.5 per cent of shares in the website. sharma was picked up for questioning on december 17 and placed under arrest the next day. besides the sale of shares, the enforcement directorate was questioning sharma for the movement of funds from his companies based in mauritius to the united kingdom and back. rbi has asked the ed to probe the transfer of funds as it looked to be a complex transaction and the exact connection between the two needed a probe.

24,Bellary cops arrest supari gang for murder,"bellary: the bellary rural police trapped a supari gang and recovered arms here. sp k.v. sharat chandra said on wednesday that the gang was responsible for the murder of gurubasavaraj, a taxi driver, who was found murdered near vakreni camp on december 6. the gangsters -- rowdy naganna, vasu alias gukka, driver prakash -- had murdered gurubasavaraj in the fields of vakreni camp and had dumped the body near a canal. the police said t. naganna, a local rowdy, was involved in many criminal acts and is said to have extorted rich persons by posing himself as an influential person with political contacts. the police said naganna brought gaddam narayana of degulapadu village in andhra pradesh as his aide and introduced him to one of the town clubs. with the help of gaddam narayana, naganna started lending loan by keeping gold ornaments of the club members who lost their money in gambling. but when they came back to get their pawned goods released, the duo threatened them with dire consequences. earlier, naganna was arrested for a murder and was jailed in 1994. he was released as the police failed to provide witnesses. in the absence of his aide, gaddam narayana began extorting money. this spawned hostility between the two and naganna was waiting for an opportunity to kill gaddam narayana. he was joined by another two criminals -- kayipalle basava and panbida chandru -- who also wanted to kill gaddam nagaraj over some dispute. panbida chandru and kayipalle basava contacted naganna who was just out of jail and a deal was struck to kill gaddam narayana. naganna regrouped his aides to finish the task taking taxi driver prakash, vasu alias gukka, lokesh and driver gurubasavaraj into his team. he is said to have transacted with his team members to the tune of rs 50,000. but differences surfaced between gurubasavaraj and the other gangsters over money matters. the former threatened that he would delink himself from the supari deal and would reveal the secret to the police. naganna and his other gangmates then decided to kill gurubasavaraj and took him to the isolated vakreni camp after they lured him with the money he had demanded. gurubasavaraj was then murdered with country-made weapons. rural circle inspector of police b. prabhakar solved this murder case by investigating the complaint lodged by kumar, brother of deceased. naganna, vasu, prakash, lokesh alias loki, kayipalle basavaraj and chandra have been arrested.

26,Mysore Lamp pays for govt tardiness,"bangalore: prestigious public sector unit mysore lamp works (mlw) which lights up national monuments like the taj mahal and purana qila, is on the verge of closure because the karnataka government dragged its feet over payment of rs 12 lakh to privatisation consultants. mlw workers alleged on wednesday that the entire privatisation process had been halted because the consultants, sbi caps, hadn't been paid their fee to undertake the process and float the global tender for private investment in the lamp company. ``industries minister r.v. deshpande had agreed to make this payment. the next thing we hear is that that the government has decided to close the company,'' workers maintained. speaking to reporters, mlw chairman r.v. venkatesh rued that the company had not even been intimated that the cabinet had decided upon closure. ``we have only read in the media. as far as we know, we are going to float a tender and get investment,'' he said. the appellate authority of industrial finance and restructuring (aaifr) has directed the closure of the company in its order issued in september. earlier, it had given a deadline of july 11 for the floating of the global tender, failing which the company should be closed. the state still had the option of appealing against this in the karnataka high court and ask for longer time to float the global tender, but the karnataka cabinet has decided against this. the industries department, however, has stated that once the excess 800 employees in mlw are sent on voluntary retirement, the company and the government could attempt an appeal in the high court. venkatesh said the priority right now was to meet the monthly salary requirement of the workers which amount to about rs 55 lakh per month. ``in the last three months, 15 of the workers have died, at least five of mental worry and stress,'' he contended. quoting the government order of july 2, 2001, directing all departments, agencies, authorities, psus and corporations to procure lamps, tubes, fittings, accessories and entrust electrification, lighting installation and maintenance works to mlw only, venkatesh stated that this had not been complied with. the company has asked the government for a working capital of rs 3 crore, as a term-loan to be repaid. ``we have also come up with the idea of asking our dealers to increase the deposits amounts and also to increase the turnover from our ancillary units. we are sure it will work,'' mlw employees union president m. srinivas said.
