0,"EPF interest: CBT panel, govt differ","CHANDIGARH: Notwithstanding the announcement made by the union labour minister both inside and outside Parliament on retaining the 9.5 per cent rate of interest on Employees'' Provident Fund (EPF), the recommendation of the finance committee of the Central Board of Trustees (CBT) of EPF is likely to be nowhere near the said rate, sources said.

The finance committee is mandated to recommend the rate of interest on EPF.

The committee was scheduled to meet on April 23, 2003, to give its recommendations, but the labour minister''s statement came a day earlier and so the meeting never took place.

But what was the likely rate of interest to be recommended by the committee? Information available with Times News Network reveals an estimated interest income of EPF at Rs 5,391.03 crore.

Based on the income for the year, the committee was to consider three likely rates of interest in the meeting.

In the best case scenario, if the rate of interest is kept at 8.5 per cent, the EPF incurs an interest payment liability of Rs 5,495.84 crore, which means a deficit of Rs 104.90 crore.

In the next possible scenario, if the rate of interest is kept at 8.25 per cent, the interest payment liability is Rs 5,334.29 crore, thereby meaning a surplus of Rs 56.75 crore. An interest rate of eight per cent will also be kept in consideration.

Sources in the CBT say that the committee''s recommendation on the rate of interest is bound by Para 60(1), read with Para 60(4) of EPF, which says, â€˜â€˜In determining the rate of interest, the central government shall satisfy itself that there is no over drawal on the interest suspense account as a result of debit thereto of the interest credited to the accounts of the members.''''

The provision has been made to ensure the viability of EPF.

â€˜â€˜An interest rate of 9.5 per cent clearly amounts to living beyond one''s means. The labour minister has not considered this aspect before making his announcement,'''' says a CBT member.

Sources in the CBT say that the finance minister went ahead with the announcement by completely ignoring the finance committee and its brief.

â€˜â€˜This has not gone down well with the members whose mandate has clearly been encroached,'''' adds another member. The next meeting of the CBT is scheduled for the last week of May.

Till then, the 32 million members of EPF have no choice but to wait and watch the public posturing and the truth behind it.

On his recent visit to Chandigarh, Times News Network spoke to union labour minister on this issue and he said, â€˜â€˜The rate of interest will be finalised after considering the recommendations of the finance committee. The rate will be based on the income of EPF.''''

2,Liquor shop: UPCC to protest the menace,"LUCKNOW: The spokesperson of the Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee (UPCC), Suresh Chandra Dwivedi, in a press conference held on Monday, said that an agitation would be organised on May 18 to oppose the anti-people policies of the government.

Dwivedi said the agitation would be organised under the Raidas Mandir flyover, near the railway lines and that a train would also be stopped, in order to draw the attention of the authorities concerned.

Dwivedi alleged that a foreign liquor shop situated on Narayan Prasad Marg, Bada Chandganj, was posing a problem for shopkeepers and families alike, who are residing under the over-bridge. Often, altercations between the shopkeepers and people under the influence of liquor also occur, he said, adding, that due to the liquor shop being in what is essentially a residential area, it is not even possible for the womenfolk to venture out of their homes.

â€œWe have even approached the state urban development minister Lalji Tandon and the district magistrate a number of times, yet nothing has been done about this so far,â€� he said.

He even showed a memorandum to reporters, dated April 27, 2003 that mentioned the problem, and which was signed by many residents and shopkeepers of the area. The memorandum even bore the receiving stamp of the district administration, on it.

â€œWe intend to hand over a five-point memorandum to Prime Minister Vajpayee, after our demonstration,â€� he said. The demands will include scrapping the membership of the local MLA, absolving the house tax of residents residing under the over-bridge, getting the liquor shop removed from the locality and ensuring the regular supply of water and electricity to the residents of the area.

3,Report on female literacy sought from Bihar govt,"PATNA: Director general of the National Literacy Mission (NLM) Jagan Mathews has requested the state government to carry out in June an impact/concurrent assessment of the female literacy programme in all the districts of Bihar where female literacy is low.

Female literacy is considered to be low in 15 of the 38 districts of Bihar.

Mathews, in a recent communication to secretary of the state primary and adult education department Anil Kumar, asked him to submit the impact assessment report on the female literacy programme to the NLM by June 30. He, however, directed Kumar to finalise the assessment schedule for the districts taking into consideration the local requirements.

Funds for undertaking the impact assessment have already been released to the districts currently implementing the total literacy campaign (TLC), Mathews said.

Although the primary and adult education department received the communication on April 22, it is yet to initiate steps to finalise the assessment schedule.

Mathews said the impact assessment would improve programme implementation and create a positive environment for tackling the residual illiteracy.

Issuing guidelines for carrying out the impact assessment of female literacy programme, Mathews directed Kumar to ensure that at least 10,000 learners are tested for evaluating the implementation of the programme, of which 60 per cent must be women learners. A senior official of the primary and adult education department said on Friday that in the past the percentage of women was never fixed for such tests. Mathews said in the districts where TLC has already been completed, the impact assessment of female literacy programme would be carried out by NLM-nominated state resource centres which would test at least 5,000 women learners.

Mathews said in the districts where funds under the head â€œevaluationâ€� are not available, savings under the heads â€œenvironment buildingâ€�, â€œmonitoringâ€� and â€œcontingencyâ€� can be used for this purpose. He, however, felt that prior to actual assessment it is essential that the zila saksharta samitis (ZSSs) maintain a database containing relevant details of the programme.

A suitable database has already been prepared by the ZSS, Muzaffarpur, using the software developed by the district unit of National Informatics Centre, Mathews said.

Mathews also sought to know the opinion of Kumar whether payment of honorarium to ZSS functionaries should be made contingent upon conducting physical monitoring of literacy centres in the concerned district, proper maintenance of records and timely submission of the monthly reports to the state directorate for mass education and NLM.

Mathews expressed his satisfaction over the implementation of female literacy programme in 12 of the 15 low female literacy districts of Bihar.

4,PM's Manali retreat causes inconvenience to locals,"MANALI, Himachal Pradesh: The mountain-locked beautiful hamlet of Manali is a favourite summer retreat venue of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and he makes it a point to spend some time here every year.

But what does his visits here mean for the common people?

Security hassles and impact on traders looking forward to earn from tourism during the peak summer time, are the common refrains of the public although the administration says all efforts are made to ensure least inconvenience to the people.

""The annual visits means problems for us,"" says Dharmendra Sharma, vice-president of Hill Taxi Operators Union.

""Police starts to impose curbs on movements at least four days ahead of the trip and the restrictions continues as long as the Prime Minister is here,"" he points out, adding, it means an impact on business.

Authorities mobilise additional police and security personnel ahead of the trip of the VVIP and special barricades are erected upto at least three kilometres from the cottage where Vajpayee spends his vacation.

""If he (Vajpayee) wants to travel through the city, it means more problems as the markets are shut down and tourist shoppers are kept at bay,"" says Janak Raj, proprietor of a shawl shop in the main Manali market.

There are also complaints of ""over-reaction"" by the police and charges of harassment of people.

""Free movement is curbed as there are a lot of diversions. Policemen even stop us at will,"" says Gopal Singh.

Authorities, however, differ and maintain that no harassment is caused to the people.

""We make all efforts to ensure that there is minimum harassment and least inconvenience to common people. But some part of it is unavoidable,"" says Deputy Inspector General O C Thakur.

He said even as the Prime Minister moves within Manali, stoppage of public movement is kept for the least possible time.

But not all views about the Prime Minister''s annual visits are critical as a section of the populace points out that these trips also entail some benefits for the place.

""Every time the Prime Minister visits this place, he announces some package for Manali or the state,"" says student Jagdish Kumar as he mentions that Vajpayee thinks about development of Himachal Pradesh during his trips.

His friend Rakesh says since Vajpayee started visiting Manali on yearly basis, the condition of roads and other facilities has improved.

5,"India, Iran agree on 25-yr gas investment deals","TEHRAN: India on Tuesday agreed in principle to buy five million metric tonnes of LNG annually from Iran for a period of 25 years during which the latter will offer discovered and semi-discovered gas fields for Indian investment.

At a function attended by the Indian Minister of Petroleum Ram Naik and his Iranian counterpart Bijan Namdar Zanganeh, India also agreed on a contract to buy five million tonnes of crude oil from Iran this year.

The agreed minutes covering the long term LNG purchase and investment in Iran were signed by M S Sreenivasan, Additional Secretary in the Ministry of Petroleum and the Iranian Deputy Minister for oil Seyed Mohamed Najad Hosainain.

Naik said the commercial terms for the LNG deal will be worked out later though initial purchase will be in two phases of 2.5 million tonnes each. India has a similar long term agreement with Qatar and LNG from Qatar is scheduled to reach India in January next year.

India has also agreed to offer its technical know-how to Iran for setting up CNG centres and CNG systems for using Compressed Natural Gas as automobile fuel, drawing from its experiment of Delhi where 70,000 vehicles including 10,000 buses run on CNG drastically cut pollution from automobiles, Naik said.

Naik said India, which has latest third generation refineries working at 97 per cent installed capacity will help modernise Iran''s mostly first generation refineries sourced from the United States and functioning only at 65 per cent capacity.

He said a major role for Indian information technology has been built into this part of the agreement.

He said the 21st century belonged to gas just as the previous century did to oil and the 19th to coal and Iran had vast gas resources to feed an energy-hungry India. This will further strengthen the bilateral ties.

The Indian ambassador to Iran Pripuran Singh Haer, who was present at the ceremony said the co-operation in energy between the two countries was central to the political leadeship''s resolve to work toward a strategic relationship.

Iran has the second largest gas reserves in the world after Russia and India, which has been investing abroad in countries like Sudan, Vietnam and Russia has long-term investment plans in Iran in return for the deal to source LNG from the Persian state for an extended period.

During his three day visit, Naik was accompanied by a high power delegation including top officials from the Petroleum and Natural Gas ministry, ONGC, Indian Oil Corporation and Gas Authority of India.

The term contract for crude oil was signed by M S Ramachandran, Chairman, Indian Oil Corporation and Ghamini Ford, Managing Director, National Iranian Oil Company.
