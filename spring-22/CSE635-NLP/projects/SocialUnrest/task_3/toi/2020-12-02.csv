0,India seeks cuts in West's farm subsidies,"NEW DELHI: Ahead of attempts to kickstart the stalled negotiations in the WTO forum, Indiaâ€™s agriculture minister is in Rome, canvassing for real reductions in the domestic support given to agriculture in developed countries.

With a WTO council meeting scheduled later this month, minister Rajnath Singhâ€™s presence at the ongoing FAO meet of agriculture ministers in Italy is aimed at building on Indiaâ€™s position that developing countries with a huge farmer base can hardly afford to jettison support to them. On his first trip abroad as agriculture minister, Rajnath has called for genuine differential treatment to developing countries to address their special concerns.

Accompanied by a WTO-negotiations veteran, agriculture secretary R C A Jain, and officials from some other ministries, Rajnath is expected to have a series of bilateral meetings. Indiaâ€™s stance has been that any agreement on agriculture which doesnâ€™t protect small and marginal farmers will put at risk their livelihood and food security.

In his address to the conference, Rajnath voiced â€˜â€˜disappointmentâ€™â€™ at the outcome of the WTO meet in Cancun but used the occasion to carry this argument further â€” even using last yearâ€™s severe drought to drive home the point that India could cope only because of its self-sufficiency in agricultural production.

Since international prices are distorted by domestic support and export subsidies in developed countries, this brings down prices and hits the competitiveness of farmers in countries like India.

1,Better voter turnout this election,"NEW DELHI: Delhi fared better in terms of voter turnout in this Assembly election as compared to last time. The overall voting percentage was 53.2 per cent, with the maximum voter turnout in the outer Delhi constituencies. Last year, the percentage was 48.9 per cent.

The counting of votes will begin on Thursday at the 12 counting centres.

The official figures released by the election office showed that voters turned out in large numbers in the west and northwest districts too.

As usual, New Delhi district saw a low voter turnout at 45 to 46 per cent. In south, the polling percentage was 47 to 48 per cent, south west 51 to 52 per cent, west 56 to 57 per cent, north west 54 to 55 per cent, east 50 to 51 per cent, north east 55 to 56 per cent and north district 54 to 55 per cent.

The electronic voting machines (EVMs) have been transported to the counting centres. The seals of the EVMs will be broken in the presence of polling agents of political parties.

A security plan has been drawn up to prevent any untoward incidents. There will be tight security in and around the counting centres. Chief electoral officer Arun Goyal said, ""38 police companies will be deployed in and around the counting centres and 22 companies will be patrolling the city to oversee the law and order situation.""

The central control room will be at the main election office in Kashmiri Gate. It will coordinate the work of all the centres. The election office expects to complete the counting process faster this year as EVMs have been used in all the constituencies.

The process of counting in EVMs is automatic.

After the seal is broken, the pressing of a button will give the data on votes polled, total invalid votes and finally the number of votes polled for each candidate.

2,Anti-slavery laws still archaic,"NEW DELHI: An ''Anti-Slavery Campaign'' was staged at Jantar Mantar on Tuesday to protest against bonded labour. Activist and actor Shabana Azmi who was among the celebrities present at the demonstration said, ""The number of slaves in India has gone up from 55 lakh about eight years ago to 90 lakh at present."" The protest was organised by an NGO that works against bonded labour.

Azmi told The Times of India, ""The menace will end only by creating wider awareness among people."" Awareness at the ground level, will help stir political will which is too lax over the issue, she added. Azmi said that it was the attitude of political and bureaucratic authorities that had done all the damage over the years and negated all the efforts of the common people to end the menace.

The whole approach in handling the issue has been wrong. Where a wholistic approach was required, a piecemeal approach has been applied. A handful of slaves are rescued and rehabilitated at a time and then there is a lull, she said. Slavery should be presented as an emotive issue, she said.

Though abolition of slavery has been made a law, it will be of no good until the law is properly implemented. Azmi said, ""Even as Indian authorities are doing nothing at all to end slavery, they call it an insult if slavery in India is discussed before the UN.""

The ignorance in India is such that the officials failed to produce the figures on how many children were working as bonded labour, she said. Considering the growing number of slaves in the country, it is obvious that the government will never be able to keep its promise to end slavery by 2007, she said.

4,Assembly by-elections body blow to BSP,"LUCKNOW: The defeat of Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) candidates in the by-elections for Harora and Mahsi Vidhan Sabha seats has struck a blow to the leadership of former chief minister Mayawati, who assumed the presidency of the party after being out of power.

From Harora Vidhan Sabha seat in Saharanpur district, Vimla Rakesh of Samajwadi Party won by a margin of 3694 votes over her BSP rival Jagpal.

The Mahsi Vidhan Sabha seat in Bahraich district also elected Dilip Kumar Verma of the Samajwadi Party. Verma won by a margin of 21,341 votes over his BSP rival Jamila Khatoon.

Both the seats were held by the BSP before the bypolls. The Harora constituency twice elected Mayawati in the past with comfortable margins.

She had won this seat by securing 49.57 per cent and 47.76 per cent votes respectively in the 1996 and 2002 Vidhan Sabha polls.

And the by-polls were necessitated when Mayawati quit her seat after she resigned from chief ministership. The by-polls in Mahsi were held after the death of BSP MLA Ali Bahadur.

The defeat in this constituency also came as a blow to the BSP which failed to gain sympathy of voters, even though it had put up Jamila khatoon, Bahadurâ€™s wife.

After assuming the reins of office with the help of BJP, Mayawati went on winning bypolls one after another.

The BSP under Mayawatiâ€™s leadership won Baheri, Jehangirganj, Gauriganj and Chiriagaon in bypolls held after these seats fell vacant.

Along with these assembly seats, the BSP also won Akabarpur Lok Sabha seat where the bypoll was held in the wake of Mayawati quitting the seat.

Only in Dibai and Haidergarh bypolls, Mayawatiâ€™s magic did not work, said an analyst.

5,Deploy forces in riot-hit Assam areas: Samata,"PATNA: An 11-member Samata Party fact-finding team has demanded deployment of paramilitary forces in riot-hit districts of Assam and handing over the â€œlaw and order administrationâ€� of two districts - Tinsukia and Dibrugarh - to the army till normalcy is restored in these areas.

The team members were talking to newsmen here on Tuesday.

The fact-finding team consisting of three party MLAs, Upendra Kushwaha, Uday Narayan Choudhary, Dinesh Prasad Singh and veteran party leaders Harendra Kumar, Rana Gangeshwar Prasad Singh, Mahendra Pratap, Binod Kumar Singh, C P Sinha, Anjali Sinha, Sanjay Verma and Dhirendra Kumar Singh visited the riot-hit districts and refugee camps at Debipukhri, Bandubi, Duliajan and Dumduma.

The team also met the Assam chief minister, Tarun Gogoi, and submitted a five-point memorandum to him, which stated that the kin of the Biharis killed in Assam should be given Rs 5 lakh as compensation, free treatment of the injured, assessment of property looted and compensation for it. The team insisted that an all-party effort is needed to bring back normalcy in Assam.

The team also demanded largescale rehabilitation of the Biharis and other Hindi-speaking people displaced from Assam within a fortnight.

They accused Assam cabinet minister Hemant Vishwa Sharma for fomenting anti-Bihari passions in Assam. The team members said that the Congress government backed the anti-Bihari passions.

This, they said, could be verified from the Assam legislative assembly proceedings which records the fact that the minister for parliamentary affairs, Bharat Narah, quoted Hemant Vishwa Sharma as saying â€œsangram against the Biharisâ€�. The fact-finding team also produced a photo-copy of the October 6 â€˜2001 issue of the â€˜Purvanchal Prahariâ€™, a Hindi daily published from Guwahati, in support of their allegation.

They expressed surprise that such incidents took place in the know of the ministers of Assam. They said that had it been done by any regional party, they would have no heart-burning.

6,MCH combines election duty with tax drive,"HYDERABAD: Be warned that when the friendly neighbourhood baldia staffer comes to your doorstep to take your count for the electoral rolls, he just might also wave a property tax bill in your face.

For the Municipal Corporation of Hyderabad (MCH) has decided to send out its troops with a dual mission: carry out election duties and collect property tax.

â€œMost of the MCH staff will be posted on election duties, but at the same time we have to continue doing our normal duties. Therefore, we have integrated both duties,â€™â€™ said an MCH official.

MCH officials detailed to elector enumeration work will be asked to collect property tax too while they are at it, said MCH commissioner Chitra Ramachandran.

Itâ€™s an ingenious device: People who file claims and objections relating to their names in the electoral rolls will have to furnish their house numbers.

The house number is all the baldia babu needs to find out whether or not the citizen has paid his property tax. So when the babu goes calling on voters, he will go armed with the property tax assessment.

Ramachandran said that according to Section 264 of the Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (HMC) Act, property tax is payable in advance on the first day of April or October.

Bills stating the amount due were already served on house owners during last August. Though many have paid up, a large number have not, the commissioner said.

The MCH has so far collected about Rs 90 crore by way of property tax. It has set itself a target of Rs 171 crore this financial year.

7,BJP prevents RJD's clean sweep in bypolls,"PATNA: The results of the bypolls for three assembly seats in Bihar proved to be a mixed bag. The ruling RJD managed to retain the Barachatti and Fatuha reserved assembly seats while the BJP retained the Sitamarhi assembly seat by a huge margin of more than 34,000 votes. However, the bypoll results announced on Tuesday were a major setback for Ram Vilas Paswanâ€™s Lok Janshakti Party as his relative and party candidate Punit Rai came a poor fourth in the Fatuha assembly constituency where the electoral battle was most keenly fought.

The counting of votes cast in the Fatuha constituency, which began around 9 am on Tuesday, saw a seesaw battle between JD(U) candidate Saryug Paswan, RJD candidate Om Prakash Paswan and CPI(ML) candidate Nageshwar Paswan. It was only in the last round of counting that the RJD forged ahead of the JD(U) and won the seat with a margin of 2,745 votes.

The seat had fallen vacant as the Election Commission had unseated the sitting RJD MLA Dinesh Choudhary on the charge of contesting the polls on the basis of a fake caste certificate. RJD candidate Samata Devi won the Barachatti seat defeating her nearest JD(U) rival Rajesh Kumar by a margin of 7,191 votes. In Sitamarhi, BJP nominee Sunil Kumar alias Pintu trounced his RJD rival Shahid Ali Khan by a margin of 34,316 votes.

9,No second crop: CADA to farmers,"MYSORE: Bad news for farmers of the Cauvery basin, with the Cauvery Command Area Development Authority (CADA) asking them not to go in for a second crop this season. CADA chairman H. Srinivas said though storage of water was poor at the four major reservoirs in Cauvery basin â€” Krishnarajasagar, Kabini, Harangi and Hemavathy â€”yield was good. Already, 80 per cent farmers are preparing to harvest their crops. But 20 per cent of the farmers at the tail-end of canals are suffering finding it difficult to irrigate fields due to water shortage.

This being the situation, majority of farmers, who will reap a good crop, are preparing for the second crop, he complained, asking them not to opt for a second crop as it would adversely affect interests of farmers at the tail- end. As a warning, he said, CADA was in no position to supply water to the second crop. â€œTail-end farmers have not been able to cultivate the seasonâ€™s first crop. Moreover, insufficient rain in the catchment area has made water a precious commodity. CADA will not be able to release the minimum water stored in the reservoirs for the second crop,â€� he said.

In reply to a question, he said, about 4 tmcft water is available in the Krishnarajasagar as against 11 tmcft available last year during the corresponding period, while about 1 tmcft water is available at Harangi and Hemavathy.

â€œFarmers have faced difficult times even when 18 tmcft water was available in the four dams last year and releasing water for the second crop is unthinkable this season,â€� he said.

Further, only 2 tmcft water has flowed into dams this monsoon as against an average of 8 tmcft, the CADA chairman said. In reply to a question, he said farmers in the basin cultivated paddy in over 1.5 lakh acres even as CADA had said that it was not in a position to provide water.

11,Navi Mumbai ACP arrested,"MUMBAI: Assistant commissioner of police, Navi Mumbai, R.B. Yennam was arrested on Tuesday evening for his alleged role in the Rs 3,000-crore fake stamp paper scam.

Sources said Yennam had connived with scam kingpin Abdul Karim Telgi and â€œgone slowâ€™â€™ on investigations when he was posted with the Mumbai crime branch in 1998.

He was arrested by the Mumbai police following a directive from the Special Investigation Team probing the scam.

Meanwhile, former state director-general of police Subhash Malhotra has come under the SITâ€™s scanner for giving a clean chit in April to former Mumbai police commissioner R.S. Sharma, who was arrested on Monday for his role in the racket.

Sources said the SIT recovered certain incriminating documents against Mr Malhotra from the state police headquarters on Tuesday. The sources said Mr Malhotra may be summoned for questioning in the next few days.

Sharma, who was remanded to police custody by a Pune court on Tuesday till December 9, has been charged with conniving with an organised crime syndicate and with dereliction of duty as Pune police commissioner in 2002.

Similar charges had been levelled against Sharma in the Subodh Jaiswal report submitted in April this year. Mr Jaiswal was in charge of the earlier SIT probing the scam.

Senior IPS officers, including the then additional director-general of police O.P. Bali, had agreed with the contents of Mr Jaiswalâ€™s report, but Mr Malhotra had given Sharma a clean chit, SIT sources said. In a letter to the state government in April, Mr Malhotra had said that Sharma â€œcannot be held responsible for any specific acts of commission or omission although the commissioner is responsible for overall supervision of the investigationâ€™â€™.

Mr Malhotra, who is away in New Delhi,was unavailable for comment. â€œMr Malhotra had then discussed the report with deputy chief minister Chhagan Bhujbal, who subsequently declared Sharma innocent at a hurriedly convened press conference at Mantralaya in April,â€™â€™ the sources said.

Meanwhile, the SIT is also probing the role of Mulani, Deshmukh, assistant commissioner Ramakant Padwal and deputy commissioner Pradeep Sawant in the scam. The first three have already been suspended by the state government.

On Monday night, the SIT searched Sharmaâ€™s flat on the 10th floor of Suniti Apartments, near Mantralaya and recovered a trunk containing investment-related documents and allegedly incriminating material, sources said.

12,Designer farming catches gentlemen’s fancy,"KOLKATA: They till the soil, tend to the land. And when the week begins return to a snazzy office or a glittering stage where the limelight seeks them out.

They are what you would call â€œgentleman farmersâ€� â€” a concept that is slowly developing in the background in Kolkata.

A handful of professionals have been quietly cultivating their interest in farming, although they wouldnâ€™t have much to do with potatoes and tomatoes. Exotic produces like black bamboo and artichokes are the in-thing.

â€œThe way a seed develops into a sapling and then into a tree is magic in itself,â€� says magician P.C. Sorcar. â€œMy grandfather took it up as a challenge that gentlemen can be farmers too, and I am just carrying on the legacy.â€�

The Sorcars own eight bighas of land between Baruipur and Mullickpur, where he grows eight varieties of black bamboo, and exotic fruits like Locket from Singapore, seedless bel and golap jaam.

â€œMost of my farm produce is gifted to my friends. I would have marketed them if there were any left.â€� Sorcar laughs.

Industrialist Sanjeev Goenka has a plot near Dum Dum where he experiments with quick-growing fruits and vegetables. So you have paddy, dwarf mangoes and guavas within 90 days, ladies finger within 45 days and cucumber within 35 days.

Corporate big wig Tapan Mitra has also been nurturing his love for farming since he was the managing director of Indal, and chairman of Haldia Petrochemical. The Mitras have a small piece of land, 30 km from the city, where they tend to herbal plants using Japanese technology.

â€œAt present we are working towards producing a new fertiliser with shells.â€� says Mitra. Other people who are joining the bandwagon are actress Rupa Ganguly and Sanmay Shome, the owner of Hotel Host International.

Rupa Ganguly satisfies her love for farming admits that her father-in-law Biren Mukherjee is the brain behind their unusual farm produces â€” broccoli, French beans, pink and purple beans, red cabbages and coloured peppers. Mukherjee, the chairman of Liebig Agrochem Pvt Ltd, calls the residential farm â€˜Bighe duiâ€™.

Shome owns around 10 acres in Bolpur, which he has been visiting almost every week since it started two years ago.

The next time you are drawn to an artichoke, chances are it has been touched by a magician.
