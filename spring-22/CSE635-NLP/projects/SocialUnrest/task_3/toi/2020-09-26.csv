0,WB to govt: Fight corruption to get loan,"HYDERABAD: For Chandrababu Naidu, this reminder from the World Bank could not have come at a worse time. As the chief minister fights off allegations of corruption against members of his party, the international financial institution, in a letter addressed to principal secretary (good governance and administrative reforms) A Raghottama Rao, has reminded him of his assurance to combat corruption and prevent leakages in spending.

It also linked the governmentâ€™s promise of combating corruption to release of the Rs 1,800 crore AP Economic Reforms Loan-II.

Informed sources said the letter also wanted the government to strengthen the anti-corruption agencies and make the vigilance commissioner (VC) an autonomous institution vested with powers to refer corruption cases against IAS and IPS officers to the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) instead of the chief secretary.

The government is eagerly awaiting for the World Bankâ€™s structural adjustment loan to implement the chief ministerâ€™s â€˜Koti Varaluâ€™ promises announced during the Telugu Desam Partyâ€™s Mahanadu conclave in May.

Sources said a World Bank team will visit the state next month to take stock of the anti-corruption measures initiated by the government. Though the bank did express satisfaction with the ongoing anti-graft effort, it wanted the watchdog agencies vested with more powers.

The bank also asked the government to post more officers in ACB and Vigilance & Enforcement wings and give them fixed tenures. It also wanted the government to start ACB and V&E offices in all districts.

Responding to the World Bankâ€™s suggestion, chief secretary Mohan Kanda has constituted a four-member committee headed by Raghottama Rao to prepare a plan of action by the of this month.

Secretary (political) Binoy Kumar, executive director of the Centre for Good Governance P K Mohanty and ACB director-general A K Mohanty are the other members of the committee.

1,CRZ rules: Coast is still not clear,"MUMBAI: Among the main prescriptions set out in the recent McKinsey report on redeveloping Mumbai is relaxing coastal regulation zone (CRZ) rules,which limit construction activity along the coastline.

On paper, the recommendation seems simple. But urban experts say that McKinseyâ€™s is just one more voice in a decade-old, deeply divided debate.

The McKinsey report suggests that relaxing the rule in parts of the city will increase land available for development by between 15 per cent and 20 per cent. If salt-pan lands, no-development zones and mill lands are also unlocked, the housing and infrastructure shortage could be solved, the report says.

Loosening CRZ rules has long been demanded by builders and many government officials, who believe the regulations are hampering the cityâ€™s development, particularly with regard to slum rehabilitation p r o j e c t s , tourism infrastructure and roads.

â€œThere cannot be a blanket ban on development in a coastal city,â€™â€™ said a senior bureaucrat. â€œIt has to be tailored to specific geographic needs.â€™â€™

A national committee, comprising scientists and headed by former state chief secretary D.M. Sukthankar, in 2001 recommended that the rules be revamped to make them more region-specific. Just last month, chief minister Sushilkumar Shinde unsuccessfully sought relaxations for Mumbai from environment minister T.R. Baalu.

Environmentalists, fishermenâ€™s groups and urban experts have vigorously opposed the dilution of CRZ rules, arguing that this would benefit builders more than serve a social need.â€�Slum rehab schemes have been around since the â€˜30s, much before the CRZ rules,â€™â€™ pointed out conservation architect Pankaj Joshi. â€œBut barely five per cent slum dwellers have been rehoused.â€™â€™

Environmentalists such Bittu Sehgal have noted that these rules protect mangroves, which are important natural sewage-filter systems for the city. They also ensure that some spaces are kept openâ€”-since Mumbai has one of the lowest open-space ratios in the worldâ€”-and prevent high-density development on the seashore, which could block the sea breezes that keep the city cool. Joshi questioned whether CRZ rules actually hinder development.

â€œBasic infrastructure like bridges, jetties and roads are permitted CRZ areas anyway,â€™â€™ he said. He suggests that the recommendation has less to do with development needs and more to with a fixation with what a modern city should look like. â€˜But he pointed out, Hong Kong is better than Bombay not because of highrises, but because it has a hour water supply.

Architects say that the opening up of mill and port trust lands will increase land supply. But according to the McKinsey report, this will provide only two per cent more land as compared to relaxing rules in CRZ areas, which could provide 15 per cent to 20 per cent more land.

Moreover, city planners hold that since areas like nodevelopment zones were categorised over 20 years ago, reassessment is overdue.

2,Four suicides reported in Malwa belt,"CHANDIGARH: Suicides by four farmers in the Malwa belt of Punjab in the last two to three weeks has once again brought the problem of stagnation in the stateâ€™s agricultural sector to the forefront and is slowly taking the sheen off the much touted crop diversification programme of the state government.

In Bathinda alone three suicides have been reported in the recent past and one other case has been reported from Guru Harsahai in Ferozepur, all reportedly due to consumption of pesticides.

The issue of suicides was in limelight in the mid and late 1990s and studies were carried out to explain the phenomenon then. Governments promised steps to ameliorate the problems of farmers forcing them to take such extreme steps. aj But has anything changed since then? Have governments done anything? Will diversification help? Why is the phenomenon localised in the southern districts of the state? â€˜â€˜If you look at these suicides they are located in those districts where input use intensification has been the maximum in the state. Crops like cotton require large doses of money in the form of pesticides and other inputs to be successful.

With small landholdings and decreasing returns farming has not only become unattractive but has also become very risky.Unfortunately, the small farmer has nowhere to go,â€™â€™ says B S Mann of the Bharti Kisan Union. â€˜â€˜Progressive deprivation is a strong factor. You don''t have to become poor to commit suicide but when declining incomes affect your lifestyle and your social standing in the village, it certainly propels you in that direction,'''' says Pramod Kumar of the Institute for Development Communication (IDC), here.

How far will the crop diversification programme of the state government go in helping solve the problem or how far has it gone in taking the load off the farmers? State government officers remain tightlipped but one agriculture department officer said, â€˜â€˜It would be unfair to say that diversification is not working.

You must understand the enormity of the problem anddiversification cannot solve these problems overnight. The program has been around for barely an year while these problems (suicides and indebtedness) have been there for quite some time.â€™â€™ â€˜â€˜The state government has to come out with a holistic package instead of piecemeal solutions, which do not solve the problem,â€™â€™ says Kumar.

No one knows the extent of indebtedness amongst farmers and reliable estimates of crucial parameters like landholding size vs indebtedness, the impact of certain crops (cotton, for example) on indebtedness and regional levels of indebtedness are simply not there.

3,Paswan for ousting NDA govt,"PATNA: Lok Janshakti Party''s national president and former Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan underlined the need for a ""secular democratic alliance (SDA) before the coming Lok Sabha election to oust the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre in ""the national interest"".

But when asked by mediapersons whether he would have any reservation if Laloo Prasad''s RJD party would be one of the constituents of SDA, he said that he would go to any extent in the national interest, but there would be no change in his stand on Bihar and would continue his campaign to liberate it from the present misrule and get President''s rule imposed here, as there is complete collapse of the law and order situation. Paswan was addressing a press conference here on Friday noon.

""I am interested in the formation of an alternative government at the Centre, whether it is formed under the leadership of the Congress or other parties.â€�

""I do not combine national interest with the state interest, as both are two different aspects. I am not ready to ignore the national interest on account of an individual. But which parties would constitute the proposed SDA would be decided collectively by leaders of different political parties and not by me or alone"", he stated.

LJP''s state president Narendra Singh, MLA, legislature party leader Pashupati Kumar Paras, secretary general Anil Kumar, spokesman Sanjay Singh, former minister Lutfur Rehman and state Dalit Sena chief Punit Rai were also present at the press briefing.

Flood relief: Paswan demanded equal distribution of relief materials among the flood-hit people of Raghopur, Mahnar and Jandaha of Vaishali district at least twice at an interval of 15 days.

4,A riot of colours in Gujarat,"AHMEDABAD: While Gujarat may be some way off in convincing investors about its status as an attractive business destination given its disturbed past, it became clear on Thursday evening that as far as showcasing culture is concerned, the Gujaratis are matchless.

Amid unprecedented security arrangements, a cultural extravaganza organised in chief minister Narendra Modi''s constituency of Maninagar aimed at projecting its culture and economy, got off to a flying start in the presence of Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani. Pomp and pageantry were in ample display all around Kankaria Lake, where colourful stages had been erected for artistes to perform traditional dances.

However, the foreign guests did not exceed 70, while the official NRI attendance was pegged at 200. Also, chief guest and Reliance chief Mukesh Ambani failed to turn up. Governor Kailashpati Mishra, simply sent a message that was read out along with those of President and the Vice President.

5,No more bandhs for IT firms,"KOLKATA: From cholbena to cholbe, is the message Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee is trying to send across to private investors. Despite the campaigners of the red brigade crying hoarse over the judicial ruling banning strikes, the CM seems set to get on with his ''do it now'' mission.

As a major step, the government on Friday conferred ''public utility'' status to IT companies as part of its updated infotech policy to protect them from the purview of bandhs, which Bhattacharjee described as his ""biggest headache"". The announcement â€“ which officials claimed was the first of its kind by an Indian state â€“ fulfilled a long-standing demand of the IT community who had been pleading to ensure their operations could run smoothly all days of the year. ""We have to stop the culture of bandhs and strikes.

We have to move from cholbena (can''t be done) to cholbe (will do),"" Bhattacharjee said after unveiling the ''Information Technology Policy, 2003.'' ""In IT, where human resource inputs are highly flexible and mobile, the government recognises the need to simplify procedural framework under the existing labour laws.

Accordingly, the government is committed to move from a regulated administration framework to a promotional framework to facilitate smooth functioning of the business,"" the policy said. IT minister Manab Mukherjee said the Infotech Policy, 2003 â€“ three years after the state''s first IT policy â€“ would spur investments and help the state garner 15 per cent of the country''s total IT revenues by the end of the decade.

6,HC refuses contempt against excise minister,"PATNA: A division bench of the Patna High Court on Friday refused to initiate contempt of court proceedings against Bihar excise minister and national spokesman of the RJD Shivanand Tiwari for his remarks against the High Court with the observation that it (High Court) is open to criticism.

Although the bench comprising Chief Justice (CJ) Ravi S Dhavan and Justice S K Singh refused to admit a writ petition filed in this connection by an advocate of the high court as a contempt matter due to some technical flaws in it, the court heard the matter taking it to be of public interest.

â€œThe people have right to criticise any institution within certain limits. The judiciary has not been exempted from criticism. There must be transparency in the public justice system. There is no judge who has not committed any mistake. But no judge should be too much sensitive,â€� observed the CJ.

He said, â€œThe judiciary is the weakest organ of the government as it is open to criticism, but it cannot reply. Hence, it requires more protection from the government and the people.â€�

â€œA rickshawpuller or thela-pusher does not know the reality. He is led by grand, colossus building with the national flag on the top. But we have broader shoulders,â€� he stated, adding that had the state government not failed in discharging its duties and responsibilities the court would not have got the opportunity to intervene and act.

Meanwhile, a single bench presided over by Justice R S Garg on Friday directed the state government to deposit Rs 3 crore with the Jharkhand government by October 16 if it (Bihar) wants to retain its share of seats in BIT, Sindri. If the Bihar government fails to deposit the amount within the stipulated period, it would lose its share of seats which would go to the Jharkhand government, says the court order.

7,GSFC to be hit by new urea pricing policy,"AHMEDABAD: Gujarat State Fertilizers & Chemicals (GSFC), already reeling under heavy losses, will be hit severely under the new group retention pricing policy for urea producers which becomes effective from 2003-04, as well as Oil & Natural Gas Corporation''s demand for Rs 118 crore gas supply dues.

GSFC is expected to be negatively impacted to the tune of Rs 53 crore due to this new policy as it has the highest retention price in its group, according to Fitch Ratings report on GSFC.

When contacted, GSFC''s Managing Director A K Luke refused to comment on the issue.

The group pricing policy (GPP) based on feedstocks used will replace the old retention price scheme (RPS) for urea units from April 01, 2003. GSFC''s urea unit has been classified in the mixfeed category along with Iffco''s Kalol unit and RCF''s Thal unit.

GSFC''s annual report for FY''03 states that this policy has caused an adverse impact on the company.

""The Government of India has provisionally announced the group concession applicable to GSFC as Rs 8,178 per metric tonne of urea for April-June 2003 quarter against the latest available retention price of Rs 9,210 for October-December 2002,"" states the report.

The auditor''s report for GSFC''s FY''03 accounts has qualified the claim raised by ONCG. ONGC has referred this matter to the ministry of petroleum and natural gas and ministry of fertilizers. It has also submitted an application with the civil judge in Vadodara for the recovery of principal amount of Rs 118.1 crore for the price difference and interest thereon. GSFC''s accounts state that ONGC''s recovery claim is not tenable in law as per the legal opinion it has received.

The income tax department has raised a demand of Rs 103.51 crore for assessment year 2000-01, which the company is disputing. GSFC''s accounts state that no provision has been made in the accounts for this claim as it hopes that its appeal will succeed.

With nearly half of its sales coming from industrial chemicals, a major concern is that further reductions in import duties will affect GSFC''s margins, according to Fitch report.

GSFC''s accounts state that in FY''03, in spite of an increase in global prices of some of its industrial chemicals, its margins were affected adversely as global prices of raw materials required for producing these chemicals in-creased in higher proportions.

9,WLL wrong number puts govt on hold,"NEW DELHI: Telecom tribunal TDSAT on Saturday pulled up the government for its inaction to stop WLL service providers from giving mobile facility beyond their territory, and said distinction between cellular services and limited mobile services had to be there despite the advent of technology.

The TDSAT, in a majority judgement, reiterated the guidelines which said basic service operators could provide WLL service on a mobile handheld sets but with condition that their range would not exceed the local call area.

The majority judgement, given by members R U S Prasad and P R Dasgupta, said that though there was no bar on WLL service providers to use new technology, the same could not be a plea for exceeding the local coverage area.

TDSAT asked the government to form a task force comprising people from the IITs and CSIR and give out the final report within two months, taking into account the views of all stakeholders.

A copy of the judgement that would provide details and arguments is still awaited but representatives of cellular as well as basic telecom operators (who provide WLL-M) service said that basic operators like Reliance and Tata Indicom could continue to use mobile switches as part of their WLL-M infrastructure.

Officials of both the companies said that there would be no impact on their consumers as per the judgement, which was 2-1 in favour of basic phone operators.

Cellular operators, who are fighting a protracted battle against a government policy that has allowed basic phone companies to provide WLL-M, had moved TDSAT against the use of mobile switch by Reliance. They want WLL-M services to have ''truly limited mobility'' that would not compete with GSM cellular service.

The main distinction, according to them, should be that Reliance should not be able to provide ''roaming'' to its customers, which they feel could be checked only if it is checked from using mobile switches in 18 telecom circles it operates in.

Instead, they insist that an interface protocol V5.2 has been mandated by their licence agreement, which should be enforced.

Tata officials maintained that they did not use mobile switches (although they are in favour of its use) except in Tamil Nadu, one of the six telecom circles (like Delhi) they operated in.

The line of argument adopted by the government as well as Reliance has been that the licence agreement does not restrict basic phone companies to the use of V5.2, but allows them freedom to use any improved technology.

In fact, earlier this week the group of ministers (GoM) had noted that Reliance was violating rules by providing roaming to its customers.

Reliance, meanwhile, maintains that it is not providing automatic roaming - as is the case with GSM cellular operators - but only a call forwarding facility that is allowed to basic phone companies.

Under this facility, Reliance customers are given new numbers on demand conforming to the numbering plans of cities/towns they are visiting. Then the calls to the original or permanent numbers are transferred to the temporary connections, which are provided for a fee.

Cellular operators call this nothing but roaming by ''another method and/or name'' and say it has been made possible because of the use of mobile switch that makes such a thing possible.

10,Young MLAs join hands cutting across party lines,"CHANDIGARH: ""Aaj ka MLA"" in Punjab is not too happy at the manner the Congress and the SAD old guard have been steering things.

The day when chief minister Amarinder Singh and leader of the opposition Parkash Singh Badal were locked in bitter war of attrition in the Vidhan Sabha, about 34 young MLAs, cutting across party lines, constituted a forum here on Friday to spearhead the cause of development in the state.

""Some common agenda needs to be evolved which any political party ruling the state needs to follow,"" said Ashwani Sekhri, minister of state for health and family welfare, who is convener of the Young Legislators'' forum.

It would include all MLAs below the age of 45 from whatever political party they come from.

Manpreet Badal, nephew of the former chief minister, who is co-convener of the forum, said that there was need to address issues of common interest.

He said there would not be any politics in the forum which would also help the younger lot to educate themselves about the problems and issues dogging the state and evolve Punjab vision-2020.

Interestingly, both, Amarinder and Badal,who have been crossing swords on various issues, have blessed the forum and have allowed the younger ones from their groups to join a common platform.

Talking to mediapersons Sekhri, without commenting on the conduct of senior politicians, discounted that there was any sense of dissatisfaction at the ways seniors had been handling the state. ""It is just that a modern approach towards the problems needs to be evolved"", he added.

The forum would be holding its first seminar on education and unemployment in Amritsar on October 6. Punjab Govenor OP Verma would preside over the seminar to be held in the Guru Nanak Dev University.

Similar seminars would be organised in Ludhiana, Patiala and Chandigarh later, said Sekhri.

Besides the chief minister, Vice President Bhairon Singh Shekhawat and Andhra Pradesh governor Surjit Singh Barnala, would particpate in the seminars.

11,Andhra govt blamed for inter-state water wars,"HYDERABAD: Legislators belonging to three regions of the state charged the government with neglecting their respective regions in the release of Krishna waters and demanded that the interests of their areas be protected.

Participating in the debate on Krishna river water issue in the Assembly on Saturday, Opposition Congress member from Mudinepalli, Krishna district, P Venkateshwara Rao demanded that the government release a white paper on the schedule of water release to the delta. The government should also clarify whether the delta farmers have riparian rights and said that the agitation taken up under the aegis of Delta Parirakshana Samithi was not politically motivated. The TDP leaders from the region also took part in the agitation, he pointed out.

BJP floor leader K Haribabu said that government should prioritise the issue of meeting drinking water needs of the people and should store 50 tmc ft of water for the purpose. Water to Rayalaseema is not being supplied as their is no water level at Srisailam. The government should take steps to ensure that the region gets water, he said.

""Only 30 per cent of Godavari water is utilised while the remaining is left unutilised. Krishna is utilised to optimum level and there is further demand for water,"" he said and added that the inter-liking of rivers would solve the problem and balance water requirements.

Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) member K Chandrasekhar Rao charged the House with diverting the debate and said that the floor leaders decided to discuss the region-wise allocation to be made before going to the new Krishna water tribunal. He indicated that the Telangana region was neglected and said that the government should approve the Karnataka proposal to increase the height of Almatti dam to enable Mahabubnagar to get water on priority basis.

As the treasury benches reacted strongly to the proposal, he said that the interests of the state would not be affected if an autonomous Krishna river water authority is constituted on the lines of Tungabhadra Board. ""The government is bluntly blaming Karnataka for the present crisis. However, the crisis is the result of the irrigation policy of the government,"" he alleged.

CPM member N Narsimhaiah charged the government with neglecting the irrigation sector in the state and said that the water wars between two regions in the state is the result of the government irrigation policy.

12,Andhra govt slams opposition as irresponsible,"HYDERABAD: The state assembly discussed just one single issue, criminalisation of politics, for four days in the state assembly and at the end of it the Congress staged a walk out.

Information and Public Relations Minister, S Somreddy Chandramohan Reddy castigated the Congress party on this account as valuable time, effort and state money was wasted with nothing to show for it.

Talking to reporters in the assembly premises, the minister said the Congress fizz was out when the government readily agreed for an inquiry into the stamp scam by a sitting Supreme Court judge. Worried that it would loose political advantage, it raked up ruckus on Saturday saying that the government should ask the apex court to narrow its perview to the irregularities that had taken place in the state in the scam.

This argument sounds strange, he said. Asking Supreme Court sitting judge to restrict inquiry only to the stamp scam in the state and incorporate other issues in the terms of reference is a demand that is without any reason, the minister felt.

This he said was a clear indication that the Congress was not ""genuinely"" interested in finding a permanent solution to such problems. The only aim of the Congress was to ""waste the time of the house, level personal allegations and sling mud at the state government"".

The leader of the opposition was never in the habit of following parliamentary practices though he had put in 25 years as a politician. Nowhere does a leader of opposition take two hours to seek clarifications. The party should learn to be more responsible, the minister said.
