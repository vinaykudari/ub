1,Grand Congress rally to be held on Republic Day,"KANPUR: In keeping with an old tradition, the Congress party here would take out a rally on the Republic Day. With Lok Sabha elections round the corner, party leaders seem desperate to make the rally a grand success.

Over 10,000 Congress members were expected to join the rally which would start from the party office at Tilak Hall and culminate in a meeting at Nanarao Park.

State party president Jagadambika Pal and senior Congress leader Pramod Tiwari would attend. City president of the party Abdul Mannan said that the flaghoisting ceremony and the main function would be held at Tilak Hall.

He added, ""Apart from Congress members the function will be attended by school children and people from nearby areas."" The function would be followed by the rally that would start at around 1:30pm.

2,My party will tie up with NDA: Shukla,"NEW DELHI: A day after parting with the NCP on the issue of aligning with the Congress, Chhattisgarh leader V C Shukla on Sunday said the regional party he plans to float would have an electoral alliance with the NDA in the coming Lok Sabha elections.

""I have already held talks with NDA convener George Fernandes in this regard,"" he said. Shukla said he would also meet Deputy PM L K Advani and BJP chief M Venkaiah Naidu to discuss matters related to seat-sharing in the coming elections.

He said his party would be a regional outfit whose name would be finalised after his return to Raipur in a few days.

Congressmen were sanguine about the developments.

They felt that Shukla, who had had problems with Ajit Jogi and had never opposed Sonia Gandhi''s leadership till last month''s assembly polls, had chosen to go to the NDA to ensure a bigger role for himself than what the NCP-Congress tie-up could offer.

Meanwhile, P A Sangma, who had announced that his faction was the ""real"" NCP, spent the day eliciting views from various sections as also constitutional experts.

3,CPI-ML to observe bandh on Tuesday,"PATNA: Irate CPI(ML) workers burnt an effigy of the Chief Minister on Sunday in protest against the murder of Sarita and Mahesh Kant, social workers associated with the well-known NGO IRA, in Gaya district on Saturday. State secretary of the CPI(ML) Ramjatan Sharma has announced Gaya-Jehanabad bandh on January 27 to protest against the killing of Sarita and Mahesh Kant along with that of another woman activist, Manju Devi.

He said the killing of Sarita and Mahesh Kant has proved that the criminals are having a field day under the Laloo-Rabri regime and that leading women activists are being targeted by them.

CPI(ML) workers took out a procession here in which they raised slogans demanding arrest of the killers and resignation of the Rabri Devi government.

Addressing a meeting at Dak Bungalow Chowk, state vice-president of the All India Progressive Womenâ€™s Association Manju Tiwari said despite Bihar having a woman chief minister, women activists are not safe in the state. Action against the DMs and SPs of Gaya and Jehanabad districts was also demanded at the meeting.

4,Draft law for transfers criticised,"MUMBAI: Under pressure from Gandhian Anna Hazare, the Democratic Front (DF) government recently hurriedly formulated a draft law to regulate the transfers and postings of bureaucrats and police officers.

But the proposal, which is supposed to bring about transparency to postings and transfers, does not contain provisions to hold accountable and penalise those who violate the rules, say bureaucrats.

Moreover, the power to transfer and post officers would continue to remain mainly with ministers. Thus, say sources in the bureaucracy, the entire purpose of the exercise stands to be defeated as some ministers could still harass honest officials by shuffling them around under the pretext of ""administrative reasons"".

Former IAS officer Arun Bhatia, IAS officer Neela Satyanarayana and IPS officer Y.P. Singh are three past examples.

An official holding a senior position in a statutory body commented, ""It (the proposed law) is an eyewash, because no law can be made without imposing consequences on those who violate it.""

Another bureaucrat asked, ""What purpose will it serve if the minister still wields power over transfers and postings? What is required is a non-political body comprising eminent citizens, which can put up a proposal to the government to order transfers and postings on a case-to-case basis.""

The proposal calls for, among other things, a mandatory three-year tenure for bureaucrats and other state government employees. ""No government servant shall ordinarily be transferred unless he has completed his tenure of posting,"" it says.

Incidentally, the erstwhile Shiv Sena-Bharatiya Janata Party (Sena-BJP) government government had issued similar guidelines on the subject way back in 1997. But the directions were never scrupulously followed.

Now, the DF government wants to ensure ""strict compliance"" of its transfer policy. Mr Hazare''s sustained campaign last year was mainly directed against the widespread allegation that police postings and transfers were being auctioned off to the highest bidder.

However, Mantralaya sources told TNN that the money-for- postings racket is equally rampant in other government departments.

Under the proposed legislation, the transfer list of senior officers would be prepared by the respective competent authority and finalised by the chief minister or concerned minister in consultation with the chief secretary or secretary of the department.

However, the caveat is that in case of any dispute, the matter would be decided by the chief minister in consultation with the chief secretary.

For other categories of state employees, the transfers would be decided by the concerned minister in consultation with his secretary.

Bureaucrats say this would enable the minister to say that he took the decision in consultation with the secretary and therefore is not responsible for it.

5,DF govt may opt for vote on account,"MUMBAI: The Congress-led ruling Democratic Front (DF) government in the state is toying with the idea of presenting a vote on account instead of a full-fledged budget during the ensuing session of the legislature.

The six-week budget session of the legislative assembly is scheduled to begin here on March 14.

A senior minister told TNN that it would be difficult for political parties to concentrate on legislative work if the Lok Sabha elections were held in the last week of April or the first week of May.

As a result, there is a possibility of advancing the budget session to February, when the government will present a vote on account. This will be politically suitable for the ruling front as no government would like to present a full-fledged budget and invite the voters'' wrath with new taxation proposals.

If the state government decides to go in for a vote on account, the budget session may be a reduced to a two-week affair. Chief minister Sushilkumar Shinde, who is busy cultivating his own feel-good image in the state, will seek support from his Democratic Front partners for an early vote on account.

Finance minister Jayant Patil, who belongs to the Sharad Pawar-led Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), is not averse to the idea, since the NCP also does not want to queer the pitch just before the crucial Lok Sabha polls.

NCP general secretary Gurunath Kulkarni told TNN, ""I do not think anybody will oppose the proposal as everybody will be busy with preparations for the Lok Sabha elections. The NCP will support the move for a vote on account.""

Much will depend on when the Lok Sabha is dissolved and what kind of time- table is adopted by the Election Commission for electing the 14th Lok Sabha.

""We are keeping our options open. It will not take us time to prepare a vote on account if the government decides to go in for it,"" said an official of the finance department.

In view of the growing deficit and huge debt burden, the state government will have to go in for fresh taxation. However, with elections round the corner, the DF government, which is already on the defensive because of the multi-crore fake stamp paper scam, is not at all prepared to take the risk of levying fresh taxes.

On the contrary, Mr Shinde is seeking ways to garner funds so that he can declare a few more sops for different sections of the electorate.

During the last budget, he announced several social welfare schemes worth Rs 800 crore.

6,Loopholes help quacks to duck the law,"MUMBAI: Housemaid Lalita Sane came close to dying recently when the friendly neighbourhood doctor treated her for malaria.

Luckily, her relatives intervened in time and admitted her to a civic hospital where the illness was diagnosed as typhoid and treated.

That''s when she realised that the private dispensary she frequented was unregistered and the doctor was not even a qualified medical practitioner.

Such cases abound in the metropolis where half the population lives in slums. Medical activists say the number of unregistered private dispensaries and unqualified medical practitioners in the city has increased in the last few years.

According to their estimate, there are about 5,000 quacks in the city. A recent random survey conducted by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) found Loopholes help quacks 270 unregistered private dispensaries in the suburbs.

Medical activists attribute the growing trend to unaffordable healthcare costs and lack of a comprehensive law to tackle the problem.

Private dispensaries, whether registered or unregistered, are, ironically, not governed by a medical law but by the Shops and Establishments Act.

The BMC says taking action against unregistered private dispensaries does not come under its purview.

""Under the law, we are basically required to ensure that the shops and business establishments shut down on time and do not employ child labour,"" said R.M. Kathuria, chief executive health officer.

While public and private nursing homes and hospitals are governed by the antiquated Bombay Nursing Home Registration Act of 1949, there is no law regulating private medical dispensaries, according to Arun Bal of the Association of Consumer Action on Safety and Health (ACASH).

""Absence of regulation has led to malpractice, which in turn has led to exploitation of poor and innocent patients,"" he said.

The BMC survey revealed a high concentration of unregistered private dispensaries in the slum pockets of Kurla, Mankhurd, Chembur, Byculla and Dharavi.

Aware of the lacuna in the existing medical laws, the state government is now in the process of enacting to duck the enacting the Maharashtra Clinical Establishment Control Act, which would cover all clinical establishments including public and private hospitals, nursing homes, dispensaries and X-ray centres.

""The implementation of the new law should effectively tackle this problem,"" said principal secretary (medical education) G S Gill.

Medical activists, however, point out that it would take several years to implement the new law since it is still in the drafting stage.

Suhas Pingle, general secretary of the Maharashtra State General Practitioners'' Association, said things have come to such a pass primarily because no authority is willing to monitor the growing nuisance of quacks.

According to him, the Maharashtra Medical Council, which registers modern science medicos, said it can only deal with certified medical practitioners and not those who are not registered with them.

""There are no provisions in the Medical Council of India Act to deal with quacks, the Indian Medical Association has no powers to do so and the same is the case with civic authorities. The police have too much on their plate without having to reckon with the fraudulent medical practice as well,"" said Dr Pingle.

7,All party meet on quota for Muslims,"HYDERABAD: The Muslim Minority Reservation Porata Samithi (MMRPS) has planned an all-party meeting in Mahabubnagar on Tuesday to decide on the issue of extending reservations to Muslims in various sectors.

Samithi president Omar bin Ibrahim al-Maroofi questioned the reservation criteria extended to individuals in the country based on caste and community. He called upon the Muslim community to unite and demand reservations in all sectors to help the community improve its social status.

The samithi has demanded reservation in education, jobs and political positions based on population and sought a special package for the betterment of Muslim youth. He appealed to the government to provide financial help to people from the community and promote selfemployment opportunities.

""Muslims have been relegated in various fields and at present a majority of them can be found as rag-pickers, rickshaw pullers, drivers, cleaners, mechanics, hamalis and as employees in the hotel industry, paan shops and farms,"" he alleged.

8,Students feel city's patriotic mood,"PUNE: As India celebrates its 55th Republic Day on Monday, what do people feel about days of national and historical importance?

How do they view the various issues affecting society? Students of the city-based Indira Institute of Management decided to find out.

The students conducted a survey to gauge people''s opinion on these issues. Conducted across various educational institutions, organisations and housing societies in the city, the survey''s sample consisted of 40 per cent female and 60 per cent male candidates.

Fifty-four per cent of the candidates were in the age-group of 20 to 30 years and the rest were above 30 years.

Open- and close-ended questions were asked to the respondents to help them express their feelings.

Questions like the three days held to be most patriotic by the respondents, where they attended the Republic Day celebrations, their contribution to various social, legal and environmental issues, and their views towards social evils like corruption.

The report notes that the responses varied from patriotic to extremely pathetic. Most agreed on the issue that patriotism should be present throughout the year and not be confined to Republic and Independence days.

A majority of the respondents (79 per cent) listed Independence Day as more patriotic than Republic Day. Gandhi Jayanti (October 2) followed these days (33 per cent). Four per cent of the respondents felt more patriotic during Kargil War Day and a few also associated India''s nuclear tests with patriotism.

A majority of the respondents (67 per cent) said they celebrated Republic Day at educational institutions and 25 per cent in housing societies. While 9 per cent watched the Republic Day parade on television, 14 per cent celebrated at their respective organisations.

While some celebrated Republic Day as part of their obligation toward the nation, some said they celebrated it as a festival and to show respect to the nation.

Many said they take pride in the tricolour and, hence celebrated Republic and Independence days. However, some also said that they turned away from the celebrations as they had become political issues.

Respondents also noted their disappointment with present-day politicians and their handling of various national issues.

Asked about their contribution to democratic, environmental, social and legal issues, a majority of the respondents said they contributed to democracy only by voting. Many also said they helped solve environmental issues by keeping their surroundings clean.

A majority felt paying tax on time was their contribution towards solving economic issues, and obeying rules was their contribution towards legal issues.

While most people said they were contributing towards democratic (65 per cent), environmental (66 per cent) and social (60 per cent) issues, legal issues received the least number of responses (25 per cent).

About their response to coming across issues like bribery and discrimination, 42 per cent respondents said they would object to such practices and 27 per cent said they would take legal action by complaining to the authorities.

However, 18 per cent said they would only suggest that people stop such malpractices and 20 per cent said they would ignore the evils and do nothing about them.

The findings note that the responses show a gloomy situation in society and also observe noteworthy differences between the responses of the young and the old.

The report concludes that though people feel the need to contribute towards various issues, few follow it up with collective action.

It further notes that various problems plague the country and active contribution by the citizens is needed to solve them.

11,Environment norms may not be relaxed before polls,"NEW DELHI: Officials in the environment ministry have ruled out any immediate change in development rules for the coast or, for that matter, major policy changes in the forest or other sectors.

With elections looming large, some chief ministers had sought relaxation of environmental norms from the Centre.

So, coastal rule ""reforms"" are being ruled out before February 5, the day the Parliament session comes to an end. Officials claim major changes will not be implemented till the election process ends.

What can be expected is ""streamlined"" rules on forest diversion clearances and possibly, a restructuring of the financial aid from the Centre for the joint forest management programme in the North-East.

That is about all, or so they claim.

Almost all states have voiced reservations on the ministry''s draft notification requiring all big urban projects across the country to get its clearance.

As Tamil Nadu CM Jayalalithaa was launching an administrative complex project in Chennai round the same time, she was the first to protest this move by her rival, then environment minister Baalu.

Baalu is now out but the objections remain. These are being examined.

This notification could be included in the larger process of ""re-engineering environmental clearances"", mandated by a cabinet committee last year.

In the light of Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani''s reported reassurances to Jayalalithaa, this could be viewed uncharitably as putting the issue on the backburner. But officials don''t see it that way.

The second issue, raised by the BJP and some CMs, is the restriction on development along the coast. A review is already on, again mandated by the cabinet committee.

A senior official says the ministry is looking at ""substantive areas of reform"", setting itself a timetable of March-end.

""We are not yet certain if a statute would be required. If there is urgency, there could be an Ordinance.""

But again, it is stressed, all this is a long way off. Coastal regulations, generally but not always a limit on development 500 metres from the high-tide line, divide the area along the coast in four categories, from the least sensitive to the most.

Within this, the rules for tourism would, for instance, be different from those for industries.

The third demand from states keen to woo tribals and villagers is on relaxing the Forest (Conservation) Act.

""We are not touching it,"" claims a senior official. They are, however, reworking the procedures for forest diversion permissions â€” for projects, for instance â€” to set timetables for a decision.

The rules being reworked would give states 210 days, against 90 earlier, to send a proposal. The Centre would get 90 days, against 60 earlier, to give a response.

But, it is learnt, regional empowered committees may be delegated the decision-making powers for upto 40 hectares of diversion.

For Tamil Nadu, there is some good news. A 29-hectare diversion for the Pykara transmission line, pending for some months, is learnt to have got the green signal.

12,No cabinet expansion in Rajasthan before polls,"JAIPUR: The much-awaited expansion of the Vasundhara Raje cabinet has been deferred till the Lok Sabha elections are over.

The Raje cabinet''s strength is only nine and most of the departments, including finance, are being managed by the chief minister herself.

During her recent visit to New Delhi, she discussed the issue with the Prime Minister and senior party functionaries.

Sources said she was advised that she should defer the expansion till the Lok Sabha elections are over and ensure that all the party MLAs work for the party''s victory in all the 25 Lok Sabha constituencies in the state.

It is learnt that Vasundhara has been allowed to make appointments in the various government-owned boards and corporations. She may selectively make such appointments to favour of some of the senior party leaders.

The sources said under the new arrangement, two of her trusted aides â€” Satya Narayan Gupta and Chander Raj Singhvi â€” are to be given assignments which will secure them the benefits of a cabinet minister.

14,BJP for simultaneous polls,"KOLKATA: BJP on Monday appealed to the chief ministers of Maharashtra, Karnataka and Bihar to call simultaneous Assembly elections in their states along with the forthcoming Lok Sabha polls, saying it would save a lot of public money.

""I appeal to the Chief Ministers of Maharashtra and Karnataka, where assembly elections are scheduled in September and also to the Chief Minister of Bihar, where the polls are to be held in February next year, to hold them along with Lok Sabha elections. This will save a lot of government money,"" BJP General Secretary Pramod Mahajan told a press conference here.

Pointing out that the Chief Ministers of Andhra Pradesh and Sikkim had already announced dissolution of their state assemblies and the Orissa Chief Minister had hinted of doing so, Mahajan said that they had taken the right decision.

""This is because there is no point having the Lok Sabha elections in April and again having the Assembly polls in another six to eight months'' time,"" he said.

Turning to the Lok Sabha poll dates, Mahajan said that it was the prerogative of the Election Commission to decide it, but ""it is the duty of the Election Commission to see that the new Lok Sabha is constituted at the earliest.

""We hope at the end of March elections will start and may conclude by the end of April,"" he said adding that it was upto the Election Commission to decide upon the dates after taking into consideration the security aspects, availability of polling stations and personnel.

15,'WB would witness miracle in LS polls',"KOLKATA: The BJP and Trinamool Congress on Monday claimed that West Bengal would witness a ''miracle'' with the two NDA partners doubling their seats in the coming Lok Sabha polls and urged the Election Commission to make ''special arrangements'' to ensure free and fair polls in the Marxist-ruled state.

""Ground realities are that a great miracle is going to happen. Together we hope to win little more than the double the seats we won in the last elections,"" the BJP General Secretary Pramod Mahajan told reporters at a joint press conference along with TC chief Mamata Banerjee.

The TC and BJP combine had bagged eleven seats (9 by TC and 2 by BJP) in the last Lok Sabha polls.

Mahajan, who held a nearly one-and-half hour long meeting with Banerjee at the TC headquarters also said, ""at the national level we will fight the elections under the leadership of Prime Minister Vajpayee and at the state level under Mamata Banerjee''s leadership.

The senior BJP leader who discussed joint election strategy and campaigning including a joint rally of BJP and TC workers to be addressed by Vajpayee in the last week of February with Banerjee, said ""we are interested in defeating the Communist regime in West Bengal"".

Alleging that popular sentiments were not reflected in the West Bengal elections results due to ''large-scale rigging'' by the Left Front government, Mahajan said that a joint delegation of BJP and TC leaders would meet the full Election Commission after dissolution of the Lok Sabha to request for making special arrangements to ensure free and fair Lok Sabha polls in the state.
