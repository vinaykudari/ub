In all, 225 laws enacted by the Bombay government and still in force in the state, will soon be replaced by Gujarat Acts.

Bhatt said earlier Congress governments in the state had not bothered to rename the laws.

But now at the behest Chief Minister Narendra Modi, legal procedures were on to rename the Bombay Provincial Acts as Gujarat Acts.

1,Cong scents victory if polls advanced,"HYDERABAD: Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) president D Srinivas on Tuesday expressed confidence that the party would come to power if the Assembly elections are advanced.

""We never said that the Congress is not ready for polls. We asked the government to spell out the reasons for early polls,"" he added. Srinivas held discussions with DCC presidents about the â€˜Bus Yatraâ€™ scheduled to begin from November 3 and on the ongoing membership drive on Tuesday. Later, he told reporters that the feedback from the DCC presidents indicated that the Congress would be on winning edge in case the Assembly elections were advanced.

He said the district units were asked to concentrate on membership drive, which ends on November 15, and the Bus Yatra. The district leadership was asked to verify photo identity cards, electoral rolls in view of possible early elections and also concentrate on booth committees as electronic voting machines would be used.

Welcoming implementation of one crore sops, Srinivas said that they should reach the needy. Stating that the TDP was likely to misuse it, he asked the party workers to be vigilant and monitor the implementation process.

Replying to a question, he said the Congress was not in power to decide the date of elections and the TDP was hinting at the early elections. He released a poster on the Bus Yatra. Meanwhile, about 200 persons from Lions Club, Red Cross Society and other voluntary organisations joined the Congress under the leadership of PCC joint secretary SP Tiwari.

2,Public appeal to end rally terror,"KOLKATA: The Howrah Ganatantrik Nagarik Samity has filed a public interest litigation at the Calcutta High Court on Tuesday seeking steps to ensure smooth flow of traffic in the city.

The petitioner sought restrictions against processions and rallies at least in the central business district of the city. Describing Kolkata as the â€œCity of nightmaresâ€� as far as traffic flow was concerned, the samity prayed for the appointment of experts to suggest remedies for traffic bottlenecks.

Annexing more than 100 photographs of traffic hazards on city roads, the petitioners rued that though Kolkata was classified as A1 city, less than seven per cent road space was dedicated to traffic.

This resulted in daily traffic congestions. The time lost in transit would add up to two yearsâ€™ time in the working life of an individual and manhours lost amounted to Rs 5,000 crore a year, cited the petition.

Highlighting some important factors of traffic mismanagement in the city, the petition stated that the average speed of the vehicles in the city was less than eight kilometre per hour.

This discouraged both foreign and domestic investors from setting up shop here.

The petition further alleged that day-to-day traffic management within the Calcutta metropolitan area was in shambles due to the callousness of the authorities.

It also claimed that the traffic snarl was the worst around Burrabazar, the wholesale market, owing to commercial activities on the roads including encroachment of pavements by hawkers and otherwise.

The petition further accused traffic policemen of paying more attention to collecting bribes from traffic rule violators, that led to traffic bottlenecks.

Kolkata was the only city in the world where there was no designated stop for buses and mini-buses run by private owners, it contended.

Private buses stopped anywhere and everywhere to pick up passengers, causing traffic congestion. Traffic flow was also disrupted by VIP movement.

Moreover, poor road conditions and frequent diggings multiplied bottlenecks. The petition prayed for the regulation of traffic with the help of advanced traffic management technology.

4,Bypolls cause bitterness between allies,"PATNA: Even as the battle lines are yet to be drawn for the three assembly bypolls in Bihar, the process of announcing candidates appears to have caused bitterness both in the RJD-Congress and NDA camps.

The Congress might have succeeded in preventing party member Sanjeev Prasad Toni from becoming an RJD candidate for the Fatuha assembly seat, it has failed to convince RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav that the Sitamarhi assembly seat should be given to the Congress.

â€œI had told Laloo Prasad Yadav that there are 40,000 upper caste voters in the Sitamarhi assembly constituency who would vote for the Congress, and with the support of the RJD, the BJP can be easily defe-ated there,â€� said state Congress president Ram Jatan Sinha.

He said the state Congress has written to the partyâ€™s central leadership recommending for the fielding of its candidates in the Sitamarhi and Barachatti assembly constituencies in which the party is in a strong position.

He was, however, quick to add that the final decision would be taken by the partyâ€™s central leadership.

Sinha said the RJD should have waited for some more time before announcing the names of its candidates.

â€œI had a cordial round of talks with Laloo Prasad Yadav on Monday on sharing of seats. We decided to talk again for reaching an agreement, but unfortunately, Yadav announced his candidates for all the three seats,â€� he maintained.

State RJD president Abdul Bari Siddiqui said Laloo Yadav had categorically told Sinha that the Congress claim was not justified as all the three Bihar assembly seats going to by-polls belonged to the RJD. If the Congress insists on fielding its candidates in Sitamarhi and Barachatti, the RJD is ready for it, he added.

â€œThough the fielding of Congress candidates in the by-polls will have no impact on the coalition, it will send a wrong message to the people,â€� Siddiqui remarked.

The by-polls for Sitamarhi, Barachatti and Fatuha assembly seats have led to rumblings in the NDA camp.

The JD(U) is demanding the Fatuha seat. A group of party leaders, in a fax message to JD(U) chief and Union minister Sharad Yadav, has stressed that the party should field its own candidate in Fatuha and seek the help of Samata Party.

However, the Samata Party is likely to field either Ram Prit Paswan or Saryu Paswan there. The Samata Party stresses that it has a genuine claim to the Fatuha seat since this assembly segment is part of the parliamentary constituency of Union minister Nitish Kumar.

The Lok Janshakti Party of Ram Vilas Paswan has already announced the candidature of Punit Rai for the Fatuha assembly seat.

5,New wave of violence in Afghanistan: Rights group,"NEW YORK: A new wave of violence and intimidation is threatening the process to draft a new constitution underway in Afghanistan, Human Rights Watch said on Wednesday.

In a letter to Afghan President Hamid Karzai, the Watch urged him to speak out against the violence and to take action to minimize the number of warlords and their proxies attending the constitutional convention.

""These attacks on political freedom are putting Afghanistan''s future at risk,"" said Brad Adams, executive director of the Asia Division at Human Rights Watch. ""The drafting of a new constitution is a critical step in Afghanistan''s reconstruction and is essential to protect the rights of the weakest members of Afghan society. What hurts the constitutional process today will hurt Afghans for a long time to come.""

Elections to select delegates for the constitutional loya jirga, or ""grand council,"" began this month in regional centers around Afghanistan.

The Watch said it conducted dozens of interviews over the last three weeks documenting regional military commanders and troops threatening loya jirga candidates and regional representatives, issuing death threats, and nominating themselves for the loya jirga, in violation of a July 2003 decree from President Karzai prohibiting military commanders and local government officials from attending the loya jirga.

The Watch also urged President Karzai and international community to work together to ensure that the constitutional loya jirga is not marred by the presence of warlords and other strongmen, as was the Emergency Loya Jirga of June 2002.

""A stronger message needs to be sent to the warlords,"" said Adams. ""President Karzai, the United Nations, and the entire international community have to make it crystal clear that-unlike last time-the warlords and strongmen will be kept out,"" it said.

The Watch called on President Karzai to ensure that procedures for investigating and remedying threats are met.

""President Karzai needs to tell all Afghans that if they order or commit acts of violence or intimidation they will not be allowed to participate in the loya jirga or next year''s elections,"" it said.

It also urged the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) to expand protection of vulnerable delegates and regional representatives by increasing the number of human rights monitors working around the country.

Establishing closer contact with persons and groups likely to face threats, facilitating the assistance of international peacekeeping forces in monitoring (where feasible), and reporting on local leaders implicated in threats was also urged.

6,Statewide BJP protest against Cong rule,"BANGALORE: The state BJP will stage demonstrations at all taluk centres on October 31 to protest ""maladministration"" by the S M Krishna-led Congress government.

""Krishna is busy attending to internal problems of the Congress. He seems to have forgotten his duties. Our protest is aimed at reminding him of his obligations,"" BJP campaign committee chairperson B S Yediyurappa told reporters here on Wednesday.

Claiming that the Congress party workers had a lot of resentment about the party''s rule, the BJP leader sought to know the reasons for Congress MP C K Jaffer Sharief and cooperation minister H Vishwanath raising a ""banner of revolt"".

""It shows that there is a bitter feeling among Congress workers with regard to administration of the state. Unfortunately, Krishna is not addressing the real problems affecting ordinary citizens,"" he added.

The BJP would highlight four issues during its protest. ""Seeking a ban on online lottery, handing over investigation of stamp paper racked to CBI and early disposal of crop insurance cases and ration cards are our demands,"" he said.

7,Two-fold mechanism for Rajya Sabha polls,"NEW DELHI: A consensus of sorts - minus the Left parties and uninvited Revolutionary Socialist Party - was achieved at an all-party meeting on evolving a two-fold mechanism for Rajya Sabha elections.

Law Minister Arun Jaitly claimed that once the open ballot system came to practice, defiance of party whip by MLAs in favour of money power would substantially, if not completely, come down.

But consensus eluded other issues like extending the same protection against removal to the other two election commissioners, EC''s demand that its expenses be charged upon the Consolidated Fund of India and increasing the security deposit for Parliamentary and Assembly elections.

The two-fold mechanism for Rajya Sabha elections arrived at by the parties envisages that every voter (that is MLA) before casting his vote would have to show the ballot paper to his party''s election agent.

Second, every party would have the right to inspect the ballot papers within a specified time limit. Rules to this affect would be soon framed by the government.

Parliament has already passed Representation of People (amendment) Act, 2003. But Jaitly clarified that the rules did not envisage automatic expulsion of an MLA from party if he cross-voted.

""Parties have the democratic right to expel members which can be done later. But expulsion would not lead to loss of membership,"" he explained. According to Jaitly, most of the political parties agreed to this mechanism.

Only the AIADMK and NCP wanted that open ballot take place in the Assembly. ""Others felt the idea was not practical because preferential vote cannot be done in the Assembly,"" Jaitly said.

Nilotpal Basu of the CPM said that the ""entire system is based on disbelief."" According to him, the Amendment Act passed by Parliament would legitimise disbelief of members by a political party.

On the EC''s demand of extending same protection to the other two election commissioners by amending Article 324(5) of the Constitution, Jaitly said the demand was logical since EC functioned as one unit and most decisions were taken through consensus.

But he said that parties were not so confident of giving away the current practice of Parliament voting EC''s expenditure.

""Conventionally, EC has got what it wants but their work also gets discussed. By demanding that its expenditure be charged on the Consolidated Fund of India, Parliament would lose the right. EC feels its demand is genuine for greater autonomy. There were number of voices favouring it but the right of Parliament to manage finance would get diluted,"" Jaitly said, adding parties wanted more time to reflect upon it. ""It is a Constitutional issue of large ramification,"" he said.

No decision could be taken on enhancing the security deposit, by double. Jaitly said that major parties were in favour of increasing it so that non-serious candidates did not participate.

But Left and small parties were not in favour it. Recently, the Cabinet had decided to enhance security deposit to Rs 20,000 from Rs 10,000 for parliamentary elections and Rs 10,000 from Rs 5,000 for Assembly elections.

For SCs/STs the deposit would be half. All parties have been asked to give their view in writing.

8,Nasscom forms global policy group,"BANGALORE: Nasscom has formed an international policy group to address global issues such as immigration and data privacy haunting the Indian IT industry.

The group, headed by Satyam Computer chairman Ramalinga Raju, will come out with a draft proposal in December, which will be submitted to the government of India.

As part of the proposal, the industry body is also stating the need for professional visas to support professional services movement across the globe. Later, the proposal will be presented by India at the next round of WTO, scheduled in December at Geneva.

According to Som Mittal, chairman of Nasscom, the group comprising industry representatives, lawyers, External Affairs Ministry officials and experts is developing the proposal to address the contemporary global needs. The group will also address particular needs both in bilateral and multilateral environments.

""Professional visas with a duration between three and six months can enable the software professionals to undertake work on the foreign land. In collaboration with the ministry of external Affairs, ministry of information technology, we are educating various embassies on the needs for professional visas,"" Mittal explained.

It may be recalled that Indian techies were earlier detained and arrested in Holland and Malaysia for alleged visa violations.

According to Mittal, the Indian IT industry today was working with around 100 countries and the legislation changes in those countries will have a direct impact on the Indian industry. For monitoring and addressing the country-specific issues on a regular basis, Nasscom has already set up a chapter in UK and other country chapters will follow.

9,Dental colleges broke rules in management quota seats,"AHMEDABAD: The private dental colleges in the state may be crying foul over the state government''s right to fill up management quota, but a list of students admitted by them clearly shows that left to themselves they would give merit the go-by.

A copy of the list provided to the centralised admission committee is with â€˜The Times of Indiaâ€™. It carries the names and per cent of eight students admitted by MP Patel Dental College, Vadodara, on 20 per cent of management quota seats.

A look at the merit of the candidates reveals that if admitted through the centralised process, none of them would have got admission to the management quota.

The first student on the list Yashrajsinh Rathod, who is also son of one of the college trustees Rajendrasinh Rathod, has secured 88.71 per cent; Rachna Modi got 66.67 per cent; Kairavi Buch received 50.44 per cent; Chirag Taluja secured 69.11 per cent; Shrey Pandya got 50.44 per cent; Jaykumar Pandya received 43.11 per cent; Aumkumar Trivedi got 42 per cent and Ami Patel secured 86.89 per cent.

While all students fall below the cut-off point (89 per cent), some are not even eligible to apply to a professional course where the admission eligibility criterion is 45 per cent. Sources said the KM Shah Dental College Vaghodia refused to even produce its own list of candidates given admission on the management quota.

The two colleges have moved court on the grounds that they had filled 20 per cent management quota before the court passed an order that all seats be filled by the centralised admission committee.

They cannot now leave the students in the lurch. But the centralised committee sources contend that before the college filled up its seats, it did not follow a transparent and merit-based method of admission, neither did it conduct a test for these students at that point.

The test was conducted later, even as a stay had been brought through a special civil application.

â€œThe truth of the matter is that when the centralised committee refused to admit students who were low on merit, these colleges were forced to move court as they did not want to return the money already collected from students. That the students admitted by them are not meritorious is clear from the list,â€� said a highlyplaced source wishing to remain anonymous.

The case is now due to come up for hearing in the Supreme Court on November 3. But even before the judgement has been passed, students being granted admission through the centralised process are not being allowed to attend classes.

In fact, based on complaints received from students and parents in this regard, Gujarat University has ordered an inquiry. The four-member team is being sent to private dental and physiotherapy colleges to acquire the list of students, and whether admissions have been completed before September 30 deadline laid down by the Supreme Court.

â€œThe team will also investigate if any student admitted on the basis of merit is being denied the right to attend classes. Any student who has paid the fee has the right to attend college. However, because the matter is in the court, we would not be able to act until an order is passed in the matter,â€� said GU V-C AU Patel said.

10,Cotton farmers get state's largesse,"MUMBAI: Caught in a bitter political feud between the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party and threats to his government over the price of cotton, chief minister Sushilkumar Shinde on Wednesday negotiated a temporary truce by announcing a total Rs 900 crore to be paid to the cotton farmers of Vidarbha.

The debt-ridden state will be burdened with an additional Rs 515 crore for purchasing cotton at a higher rate of Rs 2,500 per quintal as against the Centreâ€™s minimum support price of Rs 1,925 per quintal.

Shinde was compelled to take the decision following intense pressure from the Congress as well as the NCP. In fact, six ministers and 14 MLAs from the Congress in Vidarbha had threatened to resign if the state did not pay Rs 2,500 per quintal.

A delegation of Congressmen from Vidarbha, led by state party president Ranjit Deshmukh, met Mr Shinde on Wednesday to press their demand. Not to be outdone, NCP leaders from Vidarbha, led by excise minister Anil Deshmukh, too raised the banner for an increase in cotton price when they called on Shinde on Wednesday.

Under pressure from both the camps, Shinde took up the issue at the cabinet meeting later in the day and after an acrimonious debate for over an hour, he announced Rs 2,500 per quintal of cotton.

The NCP, however, was far from pleased with Shindeâ€™s announcement. State NCP president and rural development minister R R Patil said the cabinet should either settle for Rs 2,700 per quintal or should postpone any decision on this issue.

An adamant Patil is said to have turned a deaf ear to all reasoning by Shinde about the financial crisis faced by the state.

At one point, Shinde, it is learnt, said that the farmers rarely benefited from the higher price and that it was pocketed by traders and the local politicians. But Patil was adamant.

â€œYes we are here to do politics. Which is what even the Congress is doing. Do you expect us to sit in the Himalayas doing penance?â€™â€™ he asked. Shinde, however, declared that Rs 2,500 would be the final rate for cotton purchase.

12,AP set for early polls: Ministers,"HYDERABAD: Although chief minister Chandrababu Naidu did not make any direct or indirect reference to early polls during Wednesday''s three-hour cabinet meeting, ministers were convinced that early polls were inevitable.

Talking to TNN, at least three ministers said there were clear pointers towards early elections.

For one, there was the power rate relief announced for farmers on Tuesday, ratified by the cabinet on Wednesday. The home ministerâ€™s briefing to the cabinet on strategy against the Naxalites, included precautions to be taken by ministers, MLAs and party leaders while touring villages and directions to ministers to extensively tour their constituencies from the beginning of November.

According to the ministers these decisions coupled with a directive that all decisions taken at the meeting be implemented in 30 days is a clear indication of early polls.

The chief minister has also decided to resume his tours of the districts soon after the conclusion of the Afro Asian Games being held here. Naidu will embark on a whirlwind tour of three districts from Monday, to launch various irrigation schemes.
