0,Everyone threatens school principals for admission,"new delhi: inundated with recommendation letters, telephone calls and requests from every conceivable quarter. thatâ€™s admission time for school principals. and having been through it all just a month back, the principals are heaving a sigh a relief. take for instance, the school principal of a south delhi school who decided not to grant out-of-turn admissions. she had to hastily change her policy. many principals agreed that they were forced to make allowances in some instances. one principal reeled off the list of agencies with nuisance value: â€˜â€˜the municipal corporation of delhi, mahanagar telephone nigam ltd, delhi vidyut board, delhi development authority, the delhi police, central board of secondary education, the education directorate, ministers, mlas...even the resident welfare associations (rwas).â€™â€™ officials of the civic agencies almost always lace their requests with indirect threats. the rwas have been known to put up barriers and refusing entry to schoolbuses, the principal said. but while the principals fume about everybody else, they are willing to ignore the politicians. â€˜â€˜politicians write letters for all and sundry. thatâ€™s how they keep their vote banks happy,â€™â€™ a principal said. the problem, principal of a south delhi school said, was that everybody in delhi thought of himself as somebody important. another principal said she felt sorry for her receptionist who had to attend to all the different requests. â€˜â€˜two years ago, i got a call from a person claiming to be from the chief ministerâ€™s office. i told him that if the cm was interested she should write a letter herself,â€™â€™ the principal said. he never got back. in another instance, a person claiming to be from the cmâ€™s office who was asked to wait, stormed into the principalâ€™s office shouting profanities and left threatening dire consequences. once a principal encountered a supreme court lawyer who said securing admission to her school was his childâ€™s right and that he would file a case if denied. but the worst are income tax department officials. one day, a person turned up and demanded to see the schoolâ€™s accounts. â€˜â€˜halfway through, he said that wasnâ€™t what he had come for,â€™â€™ the principal said. â€˜â€˜itâ€™s amounts to blackmail,â€™â€™ added a principal of a central delhi school. the principal recalled how a case was slapped on the school in the name of encroachment when she did not heed a request. but some instances do turn ugly. in one such instance, the principal of delhi public school, rohini, was threatened by armed men claiming to be rajya sabha mp d p yadavâ€™s relatives. they even threatened to damage the principalâ€™s car. in 1992, armed men assaulted a noida principal when he reportedly did not give in to an admission request. given the pressures of the job, many principals have evolved strategies to deal with them. â€˜â€˜there are pressures in any profession. we have to learn to handle these pressures,â€™â€™ a principal said.

5,Sonepur voters fear violence,"sonepur: this subdivisional town of saran district is witnessing hectic campaigning for the nagar parishad polls scheduled for april 28. while the candidates are enthusiastic in their campaign, the voters are maintaining a stony silence. there are as many as 176 contestants, including 64 women, for the 16 wards here. an interesting aspect of the polls here is that some of the contestants, instead of waiting for the poll results, are already thinking of how to succeed in getting elected to the post of chairman of the parishad. several candidates contesting from wards nos 1, 4, 5, 6, 9, 11, 12, 14 and 15 are openly projecting themselves as the most appropriate candidate for the post of chairman. regardless of the candidates'' confidence, surindra mohan, a retired headmaster, says that only ""candidates of good character and intelligence would get votes this time as the voters are fed up with the ever-growing backwardness here"". while the local police claim that polls would be peaceful and fair, the voters apprehend violence on a large scale on the polling day.

6,People are indifferent to civic polls at Bhagalpur,"bhagalpur: the forthcoming municipal elections have become a meaningless exercise for many in the silk city. this lack of interest has grown out of a sense of despair here. there are a host of problems in our locality and the candidates in the fray hardly come out to help. with what face they are coming to seek our votes? asks pintu singh, a pco owner at the chhoti khanjarpur locality, which falls under ward no 18 of the bhagalpur municipal corporation. with development work taking a backseat in most of the areas in bhagalpur, the electorate is anything but enthusiastic about the forthcoming municipal elections on april 28. rakesh jha of adampur area seems to have no hope of development as he says, ""i vote with the hope that the promises made during the campaign would be fulfilled, but at the same time i know the fact that again we will feel cheated like that after the mp and mla elections."" jha wants to hold a public meeting in his locality where the candidates could be grilled before they start canvassing for the votes. the residents of the bheekhanpur locality, on the other hand, said that apart from empty promises, the candidates have nothing more to offer. and, for the candidates who are trying their fate in this much-awaited municipal elections, no single dominant issue seems to have cropped up. their options are limited as the promises of greener and cleaner bhagalpur with better civic amenities cut little ice with the city electorate. knowing it well that civic issues will not sell among the electorate, the leaders belonging to big political parties seem to be keeping them as switchback options. meet asha singh, a housewife from the manik sarkar chowk. she has witnessed several elections since 1990, but has several questions unanswered. ""who is responsible for the sunken roads, piling garbage and frequent power cuts in my locality? who can take the guarantee that a particular candidate would bring betterment?,"" she asks. ""like parliament and assembly elections, candidates sing slogans like ""harit bhagalpur, swachch bhagalpur and sakshar bhagalpur (green, clean and literate bhagalpur). but nothing appears to be changed and this silk city would remain one big heap of garbage,"" laments pradeep thakur, an advocate belonging to the tilka manjhi chowk area.

7,Council election results a setback to RJD chief,"patna: results of the biennial polls to the state legislative council proved a big blow to rjd supremo laloo prasad yadav not only because his official candidate niranjan kushwaha lost and party mlas defied his diktat to cross vote, but also because the results triggered off bickering inside the party. already, laloo followers are talking about a possible crackdown on a few rebels like shankar prasad tekriwal. kushwaha said his defeat was a result of sabotage. â€œa minister and his supporters hailing from the kushwaha caste have done this. the minister does not want any other kushwaha leader to emerge in the party. they will have to bear the anger of the kushwaha casteâ€�, he remarked before journalists. he was apparantly hitting out at health minister shakuni choudhary and his son samrat choudhary. rjd insiders indicate that though the minister himself might have voted for niranjan, his son and two other mlas - monajir hassan and pappu khan - made their votes deliberately invalid. ironically, laloo jokingly asked the samata mlas not to let down â€˜luv kushâ€™ (kushwaha candidate niranjan) in the morning. though the rjd appears to have got one vote from the samata party, the internal crisis has resurfaced. though lalooâ€™s sulking brother-in-law sadhu yadav came and obediently casted his vote, his wish to defeat the â€˜tent wallaâ€™ had been granted. it was a defeat for lalooâ€™s strategy in keeping out cpi from voting. he stated that he had held talks with cpi leader a b vardhan both in delhi and from patna by phone. â€œvardhan had assured me that the cpi would not vote. but the bihar cpi had blackened the face of secularism by voting for a bjp allyâ€�, he remarked. laloo was not present on the assembly premises when counting began. subhash yadav who backed niranjan to the hilt, left the venue immediately after his candidate got only 20 first preferance votes than the 23 he had expected. rjd circles point out that laloo had to arrange 13 votes for the congress candidate instead of the 12 he had earlier planned. water resources minister jagdanand singh defended the partyâ€™s decision to field an additional candidate. â€œthere were a lot of floating votes and the ruling party has the right to try and get these votes as it has more resourcesâ€�, he stated while the voting was going on. senior congress leader and former speaker radhanandan jha pointed out that though technically the rjd has faced a defeat, morally it had won. â€œin the rajya sabha polls, the rjd-congress alliance had together polled 133 votes, this time it polled four moreâ€�, he stressed. but political circles here stress that laloo has been outsmarted by his former friend and ally ranjan prasad yadav.

16,Kerala tops in development indicators,"new delhi: the union government's first-ever compilation measuring the quality of life of the citizens, across states and across time, was formally released by prime minister vajpayee here on tuesday. termed the national human development report and put together by the planning commission, it measures progress among states between three points of time, covering the 1980-2001 period. around 70 distinct indicators on diverse aspects of the quality of life and well-being have been measured and tracked. ``this is a momentous occasion... a new chapter in our planning process,'' noted commission deputy chairman k.c. pant, while speaking to the media. till now, only orthodox measures of income and macro-growth were being tracked; now you have a host of measurements, including access to education, health, good housing, drinking water, sanitation, roads, child labour, management of ecology, transparency and accountability in governance and much more. the 300-page compilation shows, among other things, that: india is developing, not swiftly, but steadily. the study's human development index improved annually at 2.4 per cent in the 1980s and by around three per cent a year in the 1990s. kerala continues to be at or near the top in many of the indicators showing a high quality of life; tamil nadu, maharashtra and rajasthan are among those making good progress over the period measures. bihar is invariably at the bottom of every list; its progress over the 90s is even less than its inching forward in the 80s. progress has been better in urban areas, compared to rural india. but the urban-rural gap has lessened, though still significant. as a rule, the smaller states and administrations have done better. by and large, the relative position of states hasn't changed over these two decades. tamil nadu and rajasthan have gone up; assam has come down. on the whole, gender disparities have declined. gender equality has a good correlation with female literacy. in general, women in south india are better off than those in the gangetic plain. inter-state differences on the human poverty index, a broadly measured one, are striking. declines are encouraging in andhra, arunachal, mizoram, himachal, tamil nadu, maharashtra, jammu and kashmir, karnataka, kerala and orissa. but marginal in bihar, up and rajasthan. it took the better part of two years to measure and distil the mass of data. the plan process should benefit, with a better focus on the things comprising a better life quality for the citizen.
