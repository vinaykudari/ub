2,Sonia raises pitch for state elections,"new delhi: with four states headed for assembly elections, congress president sonia gandhi has urged party workers to go to the people and explain the shortcomings of the incumbent governments, particularly since there is overall disenchantment with the nda and growing goodwill for the congress. addressing congress mps at the customary session-end parliamentary party meeting on friday, ms gandhi also expressed deep disappointment at the government's response to the debates on the agra summit, saffronisation of education and the uti muddle. describing the monsoon session as active and lively'', ms gandhi said that the congress was seriously concerned with the way the government planned and conducted the agra summit. we were most disappointed with the response of the pm and the external affairs minister. it is clear to us that this government has no policy on jammu and kashmir, no programme to bring enduring peace to jammu and kashmir,'' she maintained. similarly, she said the government's reply on the issue of saffronisation of education was most unsatisfactory. she warned that the congress would continue its vigil on this front as it falls on us to resist it with all our might.'' the congress president also castigated the government for the poor health of the economy, pointing out that unemployment is mounting, industrial stagnation continuing unabated while investor confidence is at all-time low. referring specifically to the uti muddle, she said the state of india's largest mutual fund organisation has virtually been brought crashing down. ms gandhi also took objection to statements that ministers keep making that the economy is in doldrums because of the opposition is not cooperating with its. this, she said, is false as the economy is in bad shape because of the nda government's own policies and programmes. besides, she pointed out, the congress has always extended support whenever national interest has demanded it. ms gandhi urged mps to work hard for the coming state assembly polls, stating that not only should they explain the incumbent government's shortcomings but they must also place before them the congress party's plans and policies.

5,CBI inspector alleges threat by Laloo lawyer,"patna: in a sensational statement before the court of the special judge, cbi (ahd), s k mishra, cbi inspector r k sinha, who had investigated the much-publicised disproportionate assets (da) case against former cm laloo prasad yadav, on friday charged the defence counsel, chittaranjan sinha, with threatening him over phone. the cbi official said that he had received two calls on his residential phone on wednesday and thursday. earlier, cbi counsel l r ansari on friday submitted a petition before the court saying that the investigating officer (io) of this case, cbi inspector sinha, was twice threatened over phone. sinha had informed senior cbi officers about it, he said. the cbi informed the senior sp, patna in writing about the incident but no action was taken by him, ansari said in his petition. later, sinha, during his deposition as a witness before the court in this case, confirmed the incident as mentioned by the cbi counsel in his petition. according to the petition, the io received the first call at his residence on wednesday in which the caller used derogatory words against the central investigating agency, saying cbi bhrashta hai (cbi is corrupt). the second call was made on thursday in which the caller identified himself as chittaranjan sinha who said, ""main chittaranjan sinha bol raha hoon, lalooji aapse baat karna chahte hain."" the call was received by sinha's wife who immediately banged the receiver. laloo yadav was present in the court during the proceedings. sinha's allegation came as music to the ears of laloo's arch political foes. senior bjp leader sushil kumar modi had already alleged that laloo and his followers were pressurising the witnesses in the case not to depose against the former cm. he had pointed out that as many as 17 witnesses had turned hostile in the case. the most glaring example was of a former cbi official r k dubey who did not turn up to depose before the court. it was a visibly worried rjd chief who returned to 1, anne marg from the cbi court. the timing of the allegation could not have come at a worse time. a hearing in the supreme court on the plea for transfer of fodder scam related cases to ranchi and the stay granted on a non-bailable arrest warrant issued by a ranchi court, is scheduled to be held on monday. laloo's lawyers denied the charges.

6,Women protest against mushrooming of bars in Vijayawada,"vijayawada: women in various parts of the city are up in arms against the indis-criminate opening of bars. though the agi-tation is being carried out in a subdued and silent manner, it is slowly gaining strength. from krishna lanka to ramakrishnapu-ram and ajit singh nagar, the agitation is fast spreading. leading the women are the two left par-ties, while the bjp is also extending sup-port in some areas like krishna lanka. the agitation first started at krishna lanka with the demand to revoke the li-cense of a wine shop opposite the fire sta-tion. since the wine shop is located in a thick residential locality, that too near a temple, the residents wanted it to be shifted. with indications that the wine shop owner was all set to convert it into a bar, the women started a relay hunger-strike in front of the shop. the strike entered the third day on fri-day even as the excise and prohibition de-partment officials remained indifferent. on friday, cpm activists, under the leader-ship of donepudi kasinath, staged a 'dhar-na' in front of the wine shop and ended it with a 'rasta-roko' on the national high-way-5. the temple at krishna lanka is not un-der the endowments department, and hence, there is no objection to the wine shop being located there, says a senior ex-cise official. in fact, local mla kota srinivasa rao had made several representations to the excise officials to replace the wine shop but to no avail. in ajit singh nagar locality too, the local people are unhappy about con-version of three wine shops into bars. they too began an agitation seeking re-vocation of bar licenses. the monthly liquor sales in the city have touched rs 12 crore after the opening of mini-bars. the liquor syndicate has, meanwhile, slashed the prices considerably to boost sales.

7,Rajnath may announce quota policy before dissolving UP House,"new delhi: with the threat of mlas of the samajwadi party and congress resigning en masse towards the end of october — when the uttar pradesh assembly completes its five-year tenure — hanging over the state ministry's head, chief minister rajnath singh is seriously considering calling an emergency session of the assembly next month, bjp sources said here on thusrady. what is being proposed is that he should announce his new reservation policy, and then dissolve the assembly. rajnath singh is arriving in new delhi on friday to meet the pm and discuss when to hold the state polls. the question then is: can singh then remain caretaker chief minister till early next year or will this mean an election some time in november? bjp sources say that while the party would prefer to have elections next year, it is mentally prepared to go to the polls this year. hence, the frenetic activity with several informal meetings even in the capital, with the prime minister, home minister l.k. advani, party president jana krishnamurthy and former president kushabhau thakre involved in these discussions. the pm and the home minister have also visited lucknow recently on two successive weekends. indeed, senior leaders mr krishnamurthy, mr thakre, vice president kailashpati mishra, state chief chief kalraj mishra, party general secretaries sunil shastri and narendra mody are personally undertaking a constituency-wise analysis of up. the exercise covering all 403 assembly units will be over by the end of september. during this exercise, not only will feedback from party workers be taken and organisational problems identified but party programmes will also be drawn up till end-october for the state. bjp office-bearers are meeting in jodhpur on september 13, where the main subject will be up, and the bjp yuva morcha will be holding a major convention in agra in early october. if organisationally, the entire party machinery is being geared up — with even mps from other states being asked by the pm to put their weight behind the efforts in up — rajnath singh himself has been busy. he is hammering out the new reservation policy which is aimed at the lower end of the obcs and the scs, as it contemplates dividing the obc and the sc quota into the more and less privileged sections. singh is also hiking the salaries of school teachers. this is significant as the primary school teachers are both polling agents and opinion makers at the grassroot level. the dumping of energy minister naresh agrawal and holding him responsible for the abysmal electricity situation in the state is expected to brighten up the party's image.

8,Use of lethal police force to control riots questioned,"ahmedabad: the riots witnessed in the city over the last one week have thrown up one startling statistic. two persons have died and both to police bullets. the police would lead one to believe that the toll would have been much higher had it not opened fire - to kill. but while the wisdom of the police to open lethal firing , without anybody having been killed in mob violence, is debatable , even the law enforcing agencies are pondering over methods of crowd control with minimum loss of life. indeed, sources say the government has decided to adopt ""use of equipment with less lethal force"" to control mobs but nobody is yet sure when the plan would be approved. even on thursday, a group of muslims met the home minister , emphasising that on both occasions in the last week that the police opened fire , the results had been fatal. a few months back , the home ministry decided to prepare a report, based on studies conducted on riot control techniques used worldwide, where minimum force is applied to control violent mobs. senior ips officials have been entrusted with the job of conducting studies of techniques engaged in the west countries to ""incapacitate and intimidate"" violent football fans. the officials preparing the report are going through various non-fatal options available.apart from tear gas shells (cn gas shells), there are other catagories like dn gas shells which cause skin irritation and nausea. use of shock batons are also being explored which invalids violent agitators for about half an hour . ""at the moment we are using 12000 volt shock battons which senior officials have, its use in the force is also being explored"" , said an official. city police commissioner p c pande does not really agree that the use of less lethal force could be as effective. pande says ""when two groups are clashing with an intent of killing each other police cannot be non-lethal or even less lethal ."" the group preparing the report is contemplating on the use of mascot 410 rifles which are similar to 303 but have a smooth bore. in 303 due to groves in the bore the bullets move out at a speed which can pierce through 7 people standing in a queue.the use of water cannons is also being dealt in the report. the city police has one water cannon cart , the use of which is restricted given its size.

9,Gujarat Govt fears violence could spread,"ahmedabad: there is something more sinister about the communal violence that the city has witnessed over the past week than what the bjp government is letting on as of now. but with two persons killed in police firing and the culmination of ganesh festivities scheduled on saturday, the administration is all geared up for an escalation and a possible spread of violence. ``we are taking every precaution, not just in ahmedabad but also in vadodara and surat,'' additional chief secretary (home) v.v.r. subba rao said on thursday. he, however, said there was ``no visible pattern'' behind the communal trouble witnessed in ahmedabad so far and that the two flare-ups in dariapur last week and shahpur on wednesday night were ``not inter-connected''. officials said security in ahmedabad and some other centres had been tightened and friday could be a crucial indicator of things to come in the next few weeks. the authorities at present seem rather confused about the motive behind the low-intensity violence that is taking place in ahmedabad and believe it has the potential to spread to other areas and even flare up. surat is considered particularly sensitive as eight persons were killed in police firing during idol immersion two years ago. a massive bandobast has, therefore, been made for the ganesh immersion there. while a delegation of muslims led by congressmen met minister of state for home haren pandya on thursday, protesting against lethal police firing during the clashes, the officials felt the leadership of the minority community was no longer in the hands of the main opposition party. ``this is a hypothesis which has been given to us by the intelligence agencies and we would like the government to interact with a wider representation of the community,'' subba rao said. the government is aware that new organisations like the students islamic movement of india (simi), ahmedabad muslim youth association, lok jantantrik party, bahujan samaj party, samajwadi party and others are trying to make their presence felt in the politics of gujarat which has remained bi-polar so far. however, the government believes that the current spell of violence may not be related to the coming byelections to sabarkantha and sabarmati because there is not much of a muslim votebank in these two constituencies. the bjp government is, in fact, walking a thin line because even outfits like the bajrang dal and the vishwa hindu parishad are not happy with the police handling of the communal situation. president of vhp's karnavati (ahmedabad) unit p.c. patel says: ``we will not tolerate any targeting of our cadres by the police under pressure from the minority community leaders.''

10,Two doctors arrested for ‘selling’ baby to Kalina resident,"mumbai: the vakola police on thursday evening arrested two doctors for allegedly selling a newborn baby. the police said dr kumar mulchandani (55) , who runs gopi maternity and nursing home on 7th road, khar, allegedly sold a male child to a kalina-resident dr kishore mhatre (60) for rs 4,000. dr mhatre, in turn, allegedly sold the child to a chembur resident for rs 6,000. both the accused have been booked under section 363 (a) of the indian penal code. a city court has remanded both the doctors to police custody till september 1. the child was two days old when it was sold and was left behind in the hospital by an unwed mother. the police are in the process of handing over the baby to the juvenile remand home till its biological mother is traced. preliminary investigations reveal that these doctors have been in this business for some time,'' an investigating officer said. the accused sold the baby depending on the need of the buyer whether it happened to be an childless couple or somebody who is part of a begging racket,'' he added. senior inspector m. s. khan of vakola police station told this newspaper that dr mhatre has been selling new-born children in and around mumbai for the past two years. the police have detected another case where dr mhatre had sold a new born female baby to a childess couple. the girl is now two years old. social activist sheela barse who has been agitating against child abuse reacted sharply when told about the incident. the accused must also be booked under section 107 of the ipc for abetment of the crime of abandoning the baby,'' she said. ms barse said that mumbai and maharashtra along with orissa figures prominently among states where new born babies are sold in large numbers. it's either an unwed girl or a widow and in many cases a domestic worker who is the potential victim. the doctors at certain maternity homes abet in the abandoning of the child by telling the pregnant woman that her child will be disposed off without any problem.'' she said the union government was in the process of formulating a children's charter and setting up a national commission for children to protect juvenile rights on the lines of the national women's commission. how far will it help prohibit child abuse remains to be seen but the commission if set up will be able to issue directions, summon details, hold enquiries and also execute penal action since it will be a quasi-judicial authority,'' she said.

11,"Jalgaon transportation contract was not overpriced, says food minister","mumbai: the award of a public distribution system (pds) transportation contract in jalgaon has come in for criticism from some mantralaya officials who claim the tender was over-priced by about 250 per cent and has cost the exchequer rs 2 crore to rs 3 crore. denying these charges, minister for food and civil supplies laxman dhoble claims that in fact the total value of the contract was less than 50 per cent over last year and that he has nothing to do with the matter. the civil supplies department had asked for tenders on may 9 to which there was no response. mr dhoble says this was because of a local hoodlum who held a vice-like grip over the contractors and refused to let anyone bid for the tender. the department floated a fresh tender on may 30 and received five quotations of which three were rejected. of the remaining two, the contract was awarded to baba trading co, latur. while an internal note circulated in mantralaya indicates that on renegotiation, baba traders had quoted a 238 per cent higher price for intra-district and a 268 per cent higher price for inter-district transportation. however, mr dhoble denies this allegation. the total cost of pds transportation in jalgaon last year was rs 82.8 lakhs while this year, it will not exceed rs 1.3 crore, depending on the quintals off-loaded and the distance covered,'' he said. this amounts to a total increase of under 50 per cent over last year, which is accounted for by the increase in fuel price and inflation, he said. however, a letter written by the jalgaon mla eknath khadse of the bharatiya janata party (bjp) to the secretary food and civil supplies, neela satyanarayana, on june 26 says the government would lose from rs 2 crore to rs 3 crore because of the high cost of the contract. mantralaya officials allege that while last year's transportation contract for intra-district transport cost rs 1.5 per km per metric tonne, it is estimated to cost around rs 3.52 per km per metric tonne this year. similarly, the cost for inter-district transport was rs 3.89 per km per metric tonne last year against rs 5.90 per km per metric tonne this year. thus, while the total cost last year was to the tune of rs 1 crore for 48,899 metric tonne of foodgrains, it may shoot up to rs 3.5 crore this year. mr dhoble is alleged to have overruled the advice of his staff on the matter. when local jalgaon mla, eknath khadse of the bjp, brought these discrepancies to the notice of ms satyanarayana on june 26, she ordered an inquiry. the minister is alleged to have rejected a second recommendation from the department in july to scrap the tender. a departmental note indicates that contract was awarded to baba traders at this high cost only at the behest of the minister. the matter was referred to mr dhoble, thanks to a circular released on june 19 to the effect that any bid which quoted more than 20 per cent over the last contract amount, should be sent to the department for approval. i am the one who instructed the additional collector to personally get contractors to bid for the tender since nobody in jalgaon was willi ng to take on the local don. far from being appreciated for having done something to clean the system, lies are being floated about the whole issue,'' mr dhoble told the times of india.

13,Fake encounter: CID yet to arrest accused policemen,"mumbai: the state crime investigation department (cid) seems to be dragging its feet after having taken the lead in filing murder charges against senior police officials for staging a fake encounter on the outskirts of vasai in thane district on february 4, 1999. the cid does not seem to be in a hurry to arrest the accused policemen. the cid had filed a first information report (fir) at the manikpur police station in vasai accusing then sub divisional police officer (sdpo) ravindra sengaonkar, inspector p. n. ghuge and his staff of the local crime branch (lcb) of killing an alleged robber shekhar shetty when he and his friends were running away after looting sagar petrol pump'' on the mumbai-ahmedabad highway. interestingly, additional sessions judge d. a. dholakia of the palghar court discharged shetty's friends early this month in view of the cid's report that they were falsely implicated in the dacoity by the accused policemen. accordingly, jaya bangera, umesh suvarna, amiruddin shaikh, dilip dhami, mohammed nizamuddin and nana morchure were released on august 5. although, defence lawyer for shetty's associates sharad masurkar feels that the accused policemen should be arrested in order to prevent any attempt at threatening the witnesses, cid officials claim there is no such need. investigation in the case is almost complete. our case does not merely rely on statement of witnesses. we have enough circumstantial evidence to back up our charge. we only need to record the statements of the accused police personnel and since they are government servants they are not likely to be abscond.we don't see any need to arrest them,'' a senior cid official said. sources indicate that the cid will make the arrest just a little before october 1 by which it must file a chargesheet in the court. the chargesheet has to be filed within 90 days of the fir which was registered on july 1. interestingly, 12 of the 14 accused policepersons including inspector ghuge who had filed for anticipatory bail in the bombay high court last month have withdrawn their application from the court. in a related development, a key witness in the cid case, ajay singh, who is the manager of the sagar petrol pump, has gone back on his statement to the cid. in a letter to the director general of police, subhash malhotra, mr singh has said that he never gave a statement to the cid saying that inspector ghuge's squad had extorted rs 33,000 from him to show as the money recovery on shetty. the police had shown the recovery of this amount along with two semi-automatic pistols and choppers but the cid's report said that the weapons were planted by the squad. the entire operation was an attempt aimed at securing promotions and police medals, the cid had said. in fact, soon after the alleged dacoity, mr singh's uncle and owner of the pump, srinath singh, had already claimed insurance against the loot of rs 70,000 by shetty's associates. granting his claim, the oriental insurance company paid him rs 36,000 and asked him to claim the remaining rs 33,000 seized by the police on the day of the alleged dacoity. mr singh has approached the palghar court for the amount.

23,Abandonment of psychiatric patients increasing in Assam,"tezpur: psychiatrists here are alarmed at the way the abandonment of patients, released from mental hospitals after being cured of various psychiatric disorders, have registered a sharp increase in the state. ""we had at least thirty to forty such cases during the last one year....this is a bad trend and we are very concerned at the developments"", dr s.k.deuri, director of the tezpur-based lokopriya gopinath bordoloi institute of mental health, confessed. some of the cases that psychiatrics here have been witness to are not only pathetic, but also heart-rendering. deuri recalls a case when the father of a thirty-year old schizophrenic patient, who was having regular relapses and had to be brought back to the hospital at frequent intervals, had offered the doctors a hefty bribe to ""ensure that his son died inside the hospital."" ""i was shocked. instead of treating him, the father - who was not just well-educated but also belonged to an upper middle-class family- was doling out such nasty treatment to his own son "", deuri observed. another psychiatrist, dr aparajita baruah, recalled how a very young lady, ""fairly good- looking and again from a very upper-middle class family"", was ""forsaken by her husband and then her parents after her illness, and then dumped at our hospital."" ""she was married off during her illness. anyway, after we sent her back once she got cured, the patient's younger sister commented that it was better to burn her than to take her back in the house. the patient came back, saying that it seemed her relatives needed treatment more than anybody else"", deuri recalled. interestingly, the abandonments were mostly amongst the middle and the upper-middle class. the lgbimh director analyses: ""surprisingly, amongst the lower-middle class and the poor, abandonments are negligible. it is because the stigma,attached to such ailments, are higher amongst the so-called upper echelons of society. the entire problem is being precipitated by the relatives of the patients - apparently, they fear that their relatives might become a social embarrassment to them."" deuri felt that the abandonments were rising because people were refusing to accept their responsibilities. ""this is a crime. why, we have had cases where cured patients, after returning to their homes, had relapses because their medicines were deliberately stopped. naturally, the symptoms developed again and they were brought back, with the intention that they never got cured again"", he stated. ""as per the law, one cannot shrug their responsibilities - in fact, there is also a legislation to that effect. of course, unless enforced properly, they cease to make any impact.""

28,Vanaspati industry presents wishlist to govt,"new delhi: the vanaspati industry on saturday pressed the panic button saying that its very survival was uncertain unless its demand for curbing cheap imports from nepal, lifting of ban on 25 per cent cumpulsory use of indigenous oils and concession on customs duty on basic raw material - crude palm oil - were accepted. ""to ensure vanaspati is available to the consumer at an affordable price it should be put under the negative list of the indo-nepal trade treaty and use of imported or indigenous oils should be based on the seasonal availability and price parity of oils,"" president indian vanaspati producers association (ivpa) s.k. kejriwal said here. addressing the 24th annual session of the association, he said that capacity utilisation had plummetted to a bare 30 per cent and the industry was in the grip of sickness due to cheap imports from nepal and an irrational tax structure. he demanded that the concessional rate of customs duty on crude palm oil to vanaspati should be restored as the current duty of 75 per cent made its use unviable while use of domestic oils was also not economically feasible. ""as vanaspati and edible oils were items of mass consumption they should be placed under zero sales tax like similar food items like rice, wheat, pulses and meat against the current 4 per cent floor rate category,"" he added. joint secretary in the food ministry r.n. das said that issues like customs duty were transitory in nature and issue of primary concern was to restore the health of the industry by structural changes, having stake in oilseeds sector and use of hybrid, high yielding and short term varieties of seeds.

29,"<font style=""text-decoration:none"">INSIDE PoK</font><br>All signals to more J&K violence","srinagar: pakistan's officials in charge of coordinating militancy in the valley now appear to have a twin agenda: increasing the numbers of kashmiri boys in the cadre, but downgrading kashmiri commanders of various outfits across the line of control. the change reflects the pressure pakistan is under to show more kashmiri participation in militancy operations as well as its increasing distrust of kashmiris. post-agra, the focus of the propaganda war over kashmir currently seems to be for pakistan to prove it is an indigenous freedom struggle and for india to present it as cross-border terrorism. a former militant who recently visited muzaffarabad says the day after the agra talks ended, the camps around muzaffarabad received an order to send across all the kashmiri boys who were available. kashmiris had been held back for much of the last few years and even those who went across for training have been just waiting in the wings. meanwhile, militant commanders who have been leading lights of the militancy, have been sidelined. they apparently hang around muzaffarabad, often with their wives, enjoying land cruisers and large mansions but with little role in planning or execution. even salahuddin, the supreme commander of the hizb-ul mujahideen and once the chairman of the united jehad council, has been under an eclipse since the isi became convinced that the group commander in the valley, abdul majid dar,was in league with indian intelligence agencies.salahuddin is apparently taunted by isi officers if he speaks up at meetings and his 'facilities' — a house in rawalpindi and one of his two land cruisers — have been withdrawn. according to the grapevine,dar was summoned to pakistan a few weeks after us president bill clinton's frosty visit to that country last summer. he was told to go back to the valley and spend a month gathering his forces and briefing them. he was then to announce a ceasefire with three conditions which,the isi officers assured him, india would never accept. then, he was told, he could resume militancy after a month, citing india's intransigence. dar, who had apparently been weaned over by indian intelligence operatives on his way to that meeting, only selectively followed the brief: he announced the ceasefire,but disarmed his cadre and left it in a shambles. this was more of a blow for pakistan's propaganda abroad than for actual militant operations, the bulk of which were undertaken by the lashkar-e-taiba by then. but the hizb was the only active group with a substantial kashmiri cadre and salahuddin is a prominent kashmiri figure. now, the stage is evidently being set for a fresh and major spurt of violence. this time, after several years of keeping kashmiris in the background and depending largely on pakistanis, afghans and other foreigners, pakistan is being forced to include large numbers of kashmiri boys in their plans. over the past few weeks since the agra summit.

31,5 lakh tonnes of foodgrains sought from Centre,"gulbarga: c. narasimhappa, national vice-president of janata dal (u) has demanded the union government to despatch at least five lakh tonnes of foodgrains to karnataka for effective implementation of food for work scheme. speaking at a press conference here on friday narasimhappa said the karnataka government had failed to convince the union government about the seriousness of the drought situation prevailing in karnataka. moreover, the karnataka government had not spent any additional amount except specified share of calamity relief fund. he said we would become eligible to spend money only when we spend at least some amount from our pocket. narasimhappa said all the rivers of the state were still half filled and the rainy season was in its last leg. he asked the government to take up irrigation and work pertaining to water conservation in the drought relief work. he said taking up road and building work with the drought relief amount would only give scope for corruption. narasimhappa also asked the state government to start industries in all the districts to prevent migration of agricultural labourers.
