0,Business bandh against VAT on March 26,"AHMEDABAD: Traders across Gujarat will down shutters on Wednesday to lodge their protest against the implementation of value added tax (VAT) in the state.

Representatives of tradersâ€™ associations have also decided to meet finance minister Vajubhai Vala on Wednesday to register their grievances and explain their concern over the VAT Bill, Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GCCI) president Mahendra Shah said.

â€œTraders across the state will observe a day-long bandh tomorrow even as a team of representatives will leave at 11 am from GCCI to meet Vajubhai,â€� he added.

Over 1000 traders from around 150 trade and industry associations of North Gujarat, Saurashtra and Central Gujarat met at the Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry premises here on Tuesday and took a decision to keep all trading establishments closed to express their anger over the VAT bill.

Calling it anti-merchant, Mahendra Shah said it was draconian. â€œOne of the biggest drawbacks of the Bill is that stocks and godowns of traders can be sealed, books of accounts seized, and merchants fined and jailed,â€� he said.

Meanwhile, a total bandh was observed by chemists and druggists on Tuesday to protest against the ambiguities in implementing the VAT. ""The bandh was complete and successful"", claimed Rajendra Patel, president of the Federation of Gujarat State Chemists & Druggists Association (FGSCDA).

â€œThe Gujarat government is going to introduce the Bill on VAT on Wednesday and we hope that our demands will be considered. Our next step will depend on the measures introduced by the GoG as well as the decisions taken by our parent body, the All India Organisation of Chemists & Druggists (AIOCD),â€� said Patel.

He said that over 12,000 FGSCDA members took part in the bandh in Gujarat. â€œExcept for a few emergency stores at certain hospitals all other units were closed,â€� said Patel.

The pharmaceuticals business comprises over 30000 products and it is impossible for a chemist to keep a record of each item sold on a daily basis and then compute the VAT on each product, said Patel. ""We have asked the government to take VAT in advance by collecting it at one go when it comes out of the factory â€” the wholesaler''s and retailer''s tax also be collected at this point itself. This way the government gets its taxes in advance and the wholesalers and retailers are saved from maintaining huge records which are time- consuming and costly as well,â€� said Patel.

1,GEB staff call off stir as state govt dilutes power reforms,"GANDHINAGAR/VADODARA: Gujarat Electricity Board employees called off their mass casual leave programme on Wednesday and indefinite strike from Thursday as the Gujarat government on Tuesday succumbed to pressures from the GEB Sangharsh Samiti by agreeing to amend a crucial privatisation provision of the proposed Gujarat Electricity Industry (Reorganisation and Regulation) Bill, 2003.

Coming out of the several hour long two-stage negotiations with the Samitiâ€™s dozen-odd leaders, state energy minister Saurabh Patel declared, â€œThere will be no privatisation of the Gujarat Electricity Board.â€�

While there will be no strike from Wednesday, power sector reforms has suffered a setback. Sangharsh Samiti convenor Baldev Patel told TNN immediately after the meeting, â€œWe have decided to suspend our plan to go on mass casual leave on Wednesday. We will decide our future course of action after seeing the amendment.â€�

Confirming to bring about the change in the Bill, to be placed in the Gujarat state assembly on Wednesday, a top Sachivalaya source said, â€œThe state legal department has been directed to make suitable changes in section 28 of the Bill that provides for privatisation of the GEB some time in future.â€� Significantly, the section 28 did not form part of the Bill the state government had introduced in the state assembly in 2001 but not taken up for discussion.

The sub-clauses (2) and (3) of Section 28 reportedly unambiguously suggest that the GEBâ€™s initial reorganisation would go to the state-owned distribution, generation and transmission companies. This would be the â€œfirst transfer.â€� But as for the second transfer, it can take place to â€œany other company or body corporate or person or authority.â€� Explained an official, â€œThis means, the second transfer can be allowed to a private party. This was objected to by the GEB staff associations.â€�

During the negotiations, GEB representatives were assured, there would be â€œno change in the service conditionsâ€� of the employees after the GEB is split into separate companies, as provided in the Bill. Section 29 of the Bill that talks of not giving any compensation or damage to the employees under the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, or any other state of Central law in case of the formation of separate companies may also be amended.

Significantly, seven vice-chancellors of Gujarat universities, in a signed statement on Tuesday, had urged GEB employees not to go on strike in view of the ongoing school and university examinations. The signatories to the statement included Prof A U Patel (Gujarat University), Prof P J Patel (S P University), Prem Sharda (S G University), Kanubhai Mawani (Saurashtra University), Prof Balwant Jani ( N G University) Prof Naresh Ved (Bhavnagar University) and Dr K D Vasava (Ambedkar Open University).

Several industry associations, including the Gujarat Chambers of Commerce and Industry, had also urged the GEB staff to call off the strike.

2,"Law open to changes, assures govt","BANGALORE: The government on Tuesday assured traders and businessmen that introduction of VAT from April 1 is the beginning of a long reform process that could take up to five years.

It''s not a rigid top-down system, he asserted while interacting with members of over 50 trade organisations at a meet organised by the Federation of Karnataka Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FKCCI).

Commercial taxes commissioner Ashok Kumar C. Manoli said: â€œThe VAT law is not closed legislation. As the situation changes, alterations can be made as the need warrants. As we begin implementation, we may come across more problems; it is flexible to incorporate more changes.''''

He also announced a forum comprising representatives from trade and departmental organisations to address issues as and when they crop up. MLAs pass Bill The Assembly on Tuesday passed the Karnataka Value Added Tax Bill 2003, paving way for implementation of VAT from April 1.

What traders claim Not ready; other states have announced postponement. Abolish entry, luxury, and other taxes. Continuing profession tax burdensome. Abolish central sales tax. Prices of essential commodities will rise. Penal provisions too harsh.

What government says Fully prepared; national consensus on implementation from April 1. Discussion on at the central level; will be addressed soon. Will go as and when Centre permits states to tax services. Will be phased out in three years. No; some items may cost more, but the basket of commodities for common man will remain the same.

They will be used very sparingly, and only against those found deliberately evading tax.

3,"Give us water, cry Mandya farmers","BANGALORE: The Cauvery issue has raised its head again, with Mandya farmers threatening to hold a ''jatha'' on April 14 demanding water for standing sugarcane crop in 85,000 hectares.

After a meeting with Cauvery Horata Samiti chief G. Made Gowda, JD(U) floor leader P.G.R. Sindhia on Tuesday said there''s hardly 1.5 tmcft of water in the Cauvery basin reservoirs.

4,Many hurt as SSB men and villagers clash in HP,"DHARAMSALA: A scuffle between Special Security Bureau (SSB) personnel and the locals at a village near Sapri SSB training centre at Jawalamukhi in Kangra district on the intervening night of March 22 and March 23 and again on Monday evening has created a tense situation at the village.

Seven locals including three women were injured in the clash. Sources said that a scuffle broke out after some locals, who were in an inebriated state, abused SSB personnel.

The SSB personnel had beaten up some of the villagers and even indulged in indecent behaviour with the ladies. Hundreds of locals staged a dharna for seven hours continuously in front of the SSB training centre for seven hours raising slogans against SSB personnel.

To pacify the agitating locals, R S Pathania, commandant, SSB training centre, ordered the parade of SSB personnel on Monday and five of them said to be involved in the incident were identified by the villagers. Pathania had also reportedly ordered a departmental enquiry into the whole incident.

Gopal Sharma, SDM, Dehra sub-division, under whose jurisdiction the SSB Sapri training centre falls, admitted that a scuffle had broken out between the locals and the SSB personnel twice on Saturday.

5,"SC, ST workers challenge oil firms' disinvestment","MUMBAI: As various trade unions in Hindustan Petroleum and Bharat Petroleum began a three-day nationwide strike from today to protest against disinvestment from the oil companies, employees belonging to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes challenged the sales in the supreme court.

The disinvestment would be unconstitutional because it would practically doaway with reservations, said D.N. Sandanshiv, a former member of the national law commission, who has drafted two writ petitions on behalf of the employees. The sales will be a blow to thousands of public-sector workers belonging to the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes.

The writ petition urges the supreme court to direct the authorities to make a specific provision for mandatory reservations. Of the nearly 25,000 employees in the two oil companies, about 23 per cent are from the Scheduled Caste and Tribesâ€”a much higher percentage than in most other public sector undertakings.

Fifteen per cent of the positions in public sector undertakings are reserved for the Scheduled Castes and 7.5 per cent for the Scheduled Tribes. People from these categories also get preferential promotions.However, most units haven''t filled the quotas, for a variety of reasons.

G.S. Wankhede, president of the Bharat Petroleum SC and ST Employees Association, said that once the government holdings in a public sector fall below 51 per cent, the Presidential directive on reservations will cease to apply, putting the future of the employees in the reserved categories in peril.

The employees propose to meet disinvestment minister Aroon Shourie soon. Various trade unions representing all categories of employees organised a morcha to the office of union petroleum minister Ram Naik at Goregaon on Tuesday to protest against the disinvestment plans.

Resentment against the proposed privatisation has been building for some time, and non-INTUC unions have held rallies and gate meetings on the issue in different parts of Mumbai, as also in other cities.

Disinvestment would hurt the performance of oil companies, said Prakash Reddy, an IITtrained engineer and activist of All India Trade Union Congress. He painted an Enronlike scenario. After the firm''s Dabhol plant started operations, public-sector plants operated by the Maharashtra State Electricity Board were deliberately shut down to create an artificial demand for Enron power, he said.

Once oil-sector privatisation takes place, he predicted, some public sector units will be closed to indulge the interests of the private sector. The government seems to have learnt nothing from the failure of privatisation elsewhere, he said. For instance, he said that the privatisation of British Rail has been such a disaster, it has sparked demands that operations be nationalised again.

Unions fear that the excellent working conditions in the public oil undertakings would be scrapped under privatisation and many workers would be harassed into accepting retirement. They point out that this has already happened in BALCO, where hundreds of employees from Kolkata were suddenly asked to go to Delhi.

Bharat Petroleum is ready with a severance package for its employees, waiting only for privatisation. Indian Oil and ONGC have already announced a voluntary retirement scheme. Satish Kumar Nair, general secretary of the Bharat Petroleum unit of the Petroleum Employees Union, said that apart from job security, workers were afraid that their rights would not be respected.However, he said that his union did not believe in striking on the issue.

6,Virbhadra turned the tide in HP polls: Sukh Ram,"SHIMLA: Himachal Vikas Congress (HVC) supremo Sukh Ram on Tuesday reiterated that his party would neither merge with the Congress or the BJP, adding that he would strengthen it to emerge as an alternate to the two national parties in the state.

Participating in the discussion on motion of thanks to the governorâ€™s address in the Himachal assembly, Sukh Ram admitted that his partyâ€™s vote percentage in February 26 assembly elections had fallen, but he added that the same had happened to both the BJP and the Congress.

Congratulating chief minister Virbhadra Singh for leading Congress to an impressive victory, he, however, hastened to add that he was thinking that the BJP would get 20 to 22 seats, the Congress 28 to 30 seats and the HVC would re-emerge as the king-maker in the state polity with over 10 seats.

â€˜â€˜We were in a strong position in 16 assembly segments and confident of winning in atleast 10, but it was some â€˜tantra-mantraâ€™ on the part of Virbhadra Singh that the tide turned in Congressâ€™ favour in the last two days, â€˜â€™ he added.

The former union telecom minister came out strongly against Prem Kumar Dhumal, alleging that though his party had helped the BJP to come to power, the former chief minister had spent his entire term in breaking and weakening HVC.

Accusing Dhumal of humiliating the HVC ministers and the two party MLAs that had defected to BJP, he said that those two persons were not even given BJP tickets and were forced to contest on HVC ticket.

Sukh Ram also claimed that while BJP had contested the recent assembly elections in the state on the issue of development and the Congress on corruption, only HVC had gone to the masses on an economic plank of making Himachal debt free and creating employment opportunities for the lakhs of youth in the state.

He said that the people had a lot of expectations from Virbhadra Singh and urged the latter not to repeat the mistakes made by Dhumal and utilise the experience of the present cabinet. â€˜â€˜I have some plans and programmes to make the state self-reliant and solve the unemployment problem, which can be discussed and utilisedâ€™â€™, he added.

Kuldeep Pathania of IND said that previous government had an inexperienced team.

7,Malik is cleared by senior law official,"MUMBAI: Minister of state for housing Nawab Malik got a clean chit on Tuesday from additional solicitor general of India Mukul Rohtagi, who ruled that the Lok Ayuktaâ€™s inquiry against him was illegal.

In a four-page note, Mr Rohtagi has said the Lok Ayukta â€œhad no jurisdiction to investigateâ€™â€™ the complaint against Mr Malik in the Jariwala chawls redevelopment case. Mr Rohtagiâ€™s opinion had been sought by the state government.

The Lok Ayukta, V.P. Tipnis, had ticked off Mr Malik for halting the redevelopment of the dilapidated Jariwala chawls at Mahim by the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority.

The Bombay high court in 1994 had directed MHADA to redevelop the chawls. Some tenants accused the minister of stopping the work â€œto favour a builder and also to cause undue harm to the tenants languishing in the transit camp since 1988â€™â€™. The minister denied the charge.

Taking a serious view of the charge, the Lok Ayukta in its report passed strictures against Mr Malik and recommended that he be removed from the state ministry.

However, Mr Rohtagi said that Mr Tipnisâ€™ recommendation â€œis illegalâ€™â€™ and that the â€œright to appoint any person as minister or removal from the council of ministers is the prerogative of the chief minister unless there is legal disqualification incurred by the person, where the removal could be mandatoryâ€™â€™.

The state on Tuesday tabled Mr Rohatgiâ€™s opinion along with the Lok Ayuktaâ€™s inquiry report and an explanation of it. Mr Malik later told journalists that he had not done anything wrong. â€œIn fact, the stop-work notice was issued by me on repeated requests by BJP MLA Hemendra Mehta and Sena MLA Suresh Gambhir,â€™â€™ he said.

He said the stay order issued by him in March 2001 was never executed by the department and that he had vacated the stay in July 2001. â€œIt was in October 2001 that the Lok Ayukta served me with notice for misuse of powers, when the stay orders were vacated three months earlier,â€™â€™ he said.

Mr Malik claimed that it was Chandrakant Khaire, the former housing minister in the Shiv Sena-BJP government, who instructed the department to issue a Letter of Intent to a private builder to redevelop the chawls in violation of the High Court order.

â€œEven the Supreme Court has cleared me of the allegations and has directed that a fresh decision be taken by the state notwithstanding the orders of the Bombay high court,â€™â€™ Mr Malik said.

â€œHowever, the opposition was trying to complicate the situation and preventing us from taking any decision on the fate of the 100-plus families who stay in the dangerous chawls.â€™â€™

The minister said the state would shortly convene a joint committee of members to sort out the issue.

8,"Chemists protest against VAT, down shutters","BATHINDA: The chemists in the city kept their shutters down on Tuesday to protest against the proposed switching over to Value Added Tax in Punjab from next month. Expressing apprehension about the introduction of the VAT regime the chemists protested that it would increase the burden of taxes on already expensive medicines which would then be completely out of approach of a common man because of high rate of taxes.

RD Gupta, president Punjab Chemists Association said that under the proposed system, which will replace the existing single-point sales tax regime, the burden of sale tax on the medicine would be increased from eight per cent to 12.5 per cent. A new tax, Local Area Development tax, of 2 per cent would also be levied on the medicines. A rally was organised and all chemist shops were kept closed in protest. However, Gupta said that emergency cases were attended to.

The chemists demanded the state government should waive off all taxes on the medicines as the escalating prices of medicines have put a near unbearable burden on the consumers especially the financially weaker section. The chemists demanded that sale tax more than 4 per cent on medicines should not be imposed under any circumstances. It was also highlighted that medicines in the country are highly taxed already and taxes, including excise and sales tax, are adding to the cost of medicine by 55 per cent to 60 per cent.

9,Teachers to protest cut in grants to colleges,"JALANDHAR/CHANDIGARH: The Punjab and Chandigarh College Teachersâ€™ Union (PCCTU) expressed shock at the 20 per cent cut imposed on the grants for non-government colleges in the budget presented by the Punjab government.

All along the union had been demanding fulfilment of poll promises regarding restoration of full 95 per cent grant, otherwise the colleges would have to close down. Thousands of teachers have been going without salaries and CPF for months since the grant had been frozen at Rs 72 crore. Financial cuts would further reduce the number of students.

In view of the present crisis and realising that the government had gone back on its poll promises to the teachers, the union has decided to launch a massive â€œsatyagrahaâ€�. SS Hundal, president and Dr VK Tewari, general secretary of PCCTU, on Tuesday announced that all teachers would proceed on mass casual leave on March 28 and hold a rally at Matka Chowk, Chandigarh. Teachers would also boycott university exam duties.

In Chandigarh, the PCCTU has decided to go in for mass arrests starting March 28. They have also threatened to boycott the Panjab University annual examinations which are beginning on April 2.

PCCTU president SS Hundal said that this decision was sparked by Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singhâ€™s inability to conduct the sub committee meeting as had been promised on March 17.

On the CMâ€™s appeal, the PCCTU had decided to postpone the mass arrest which was to begin on March 20.

â€˜â€˜A further cut of 10 per cent has been announced in grants to private colleges in Punjab in the recently announced budget. This goes against the promise which was made to us earlier,â€™â€™ Hundal told TNN.

10,Civic polls: Akalis extract promise on substantive motion,"CHANDIGARH: The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) legislators, agitated over the large scale irregularities in the local bodies election, extracted a promise from the Speaker that he would accept a substantive motion on the issue.

Akali legislator Manpreet Badal raised the issue of gross irregularities in the polls of chairmen of the civic bodies pointing out that elected members owing allegiance to opposition were threatened, pressurised and even kidnapped to ensure victory of the ruling party nominees. He waived a couple of newspapers suggesting these were full of such reports and even manhandling and beating of senior SAD leader Kanwaljit Singh.

Intervening on the issue, local government minister Jagjit Singh said the SAD-BJP combine had been completely wiped out in the civic polls in the state and now they were raking the issue of alleged irregularities as damage control exercise. But much of what he said was drowned in the din of the house as SAD members continued raising slogans.

Ignoring the protest of SAD members, the Speaker asked Akali legislator Satwant Kaur to go ahead with her call attention notice but she pleaded that she cannot till order was restored. At this stage finance minister Lal Singh came to her rescue and said the Akalis were not permitting their own colleague to speak and in lighter vain urged the Speaker to protect her interests which were being trampled upon by the Akalis.

When the Speaker refused to entertain the SAD demand, its agitated legislators started raising slogans and decided to walk-out but then suddenly moved towards the well of the House. But then, the Speaker successfully persuaded the members to return to their seats but only after promising that he would certainly admit a substantive motion on the issue.

11,Fare increase angers all,"KOLKATA: The whole exercise of fare increase has come to follow a familiar pattern. Private bus owners had asked for an extra-ordinary hike in fares after the recent rise in diesel price.

The state government responded late, after some owners had already announced a strike. The proposed revised fares by the transport department have been discarded by the owners but will subsequently be accepted by them, though â€˜under protestâ€™. Finally, everything will return to normal with passengers being forced to pay more and both the government and the bus owners forgetting about the clause regarding better amenities.

Bus syndicates in Kolkata have called the revised fares â€œunrealisticâ€�.

They have rejected the proposed fare structure, claiming that it is less than the existing one.A series of meetings has been scheduled for Wednesday after which owners will announce their next course of action.

â€œThis is a politically motivated decision and it will be impossible to run buses with the revised fares. We will decide our next course of action at a meeting of six transport organisations,â€� said Joint Council of Bus Syndicates general secretary Sadhan Das.

His views are echoed by Bengal Bus Syndicate president S.K. Saha.

â€œEven the government is aware that it is not possible to run services at the proposed rates. It is not just diesel that has become more expensive. Other costs have also gone up. After increase in diesel price, our expenses have gone up by almost Rs 450 a day per bus. Under the revised fare structure, we can only recover Rs 300,â€� Saha claimed.

Both syndicates have termed â€œunrealisticâ€�, the government stipulation to provide better passenger amenities in buses and better safety regulations. â€œWe will obviously try our best to keep safety standards high because it is better for us as well. But, given the high running costs, we often have to compromise,â€� Das said.

12,Oppn for minister's ouster,"PATNA: The opposition on Tuesday demanded the removal of minister for public relation department Sitaram Yadav as the Sitamarhi district administration had filed a case under the Dalit Atrocities Act for his alleged involvement in grabbing four acres of land of a Dalit, Ram Jivan Paswan, at Naya Tola village under the Nanpur police station in Sitamarhi.

The ministerâ€™s involvement in this serious case was disclosed by the leader of the opposition, Sushil Kumar Modi, while intervening in the debate on the third supplementary budget in the assembly. He said not only had the minister grabbed the land about four years back, but also built a house on it. Modi said the government should remove the minister at once.

When the opposition members demanded resignation of the minister, deputy speaker Bhola Prasad Singh said this was not the proper way to raise the matter. Later, talking to newsmen, the minister denied the allegation, saying he was ready to face an inquiry.

13,VAT to increase drug prices,"HYDERABAD: Despite the confusion rankling the stateâ€™s pharmaceutical industry with regard to the imposition of value added tax (VAT) from April 1, quick estimates show prices of drugs and medicines will rise by 4 to 6 per cent.

Pharma products are currently taxed at 10 per cent under sales tax regulations.

Under VAT, these products would attract a 12.5 per cent levy. â€œDrug dealers usually absorb local taxes from their profit margin.

But with VAT, this will no longer be possible,â€� said Andhra Pradesh Chemists and Druggists Association president Ramesh Chandra Gupta.

The state gets an annual tax of Rs 180 crore from the pharma market. Under VAT, it may rise to Rs 300 crore. â€œThe additional Rs 120 crore has to be borne by consumers,â€� Gupta said. If all this points to the customer bearing the brunt, why are drug dealers, who held a bandh on Tuesday, perturbed? â€œThe challenge before dealers is to convince consumers to absorb the hike,â€� said a chemist.

Dealers are also worried about a different tax regime for turnover tax (ToT) and casual dealers. While ToT dealers will levy only 1.5 per cent tax, casual drug traders will not pass the burden to customers.

So dealers under VAT may see customers making a beeline for the other category traders. â€œThe very purpose of VAT is defeated due to varying taxes,â€� said Gupta.

14,Former Gujarat home minister Haren Pandya shot dead,"AHMEDABAD: Former Gujarat home minister Haren Pandya was shot dead by unidentified gunmen on Wednesday morning. Pandya was returning from his morning walk when he was shot at from close range.

Forty three-year-old Pandya was hit by five bullets fired from close range in his chest, neck and lower abdomen and was rushed to V S hospital where doctors unsuccessfully struggled to save him, according to doctors who attended on him.

Pandya was declared ""dead"" when he was brought to the hospital at 11 AM, they said.

Pandya was shot by two assailants in Ahmedabad, said Police Commissioner K R Kaushik.

Official sources said the gunmen on a motorcycle opened fire on Pandya when he sat in his car and was about to drive back home at around 10.30 am after finishing his morning walk.

According to sources, Pandya lay unattended for nearly half an hour before people could notice him.

""He is no more,"" said Venkaiah Naidu, president of the Bharatiya Janata Party. He said Pandya was shot from a car that pulled up to him as he took his morning walk.

His body has been sent for post-mortem, said the Resident Medical Officer of V S Hospital.

Police said they feared violence would break out among followers of Pandya. A red alert has been sounded in Gujarat after the incident.

The attack was similar to one in December, when two men on a motorcycle shot at Dr. Jaideep Patel, general secretary of the World Hindu Council, as he rode in his car. He recovered from bullet wounds in his throat and face.

Patel had been accused by police and human rights groups of organising riots in retaliation of Godhra massacre in February.

Pandya was also associated with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh.

17,HC asks ASI to include Muslims in team,"LUCKNOW: The Allahabad High Court, hearing Ram Janambhoomi-Babri Masjid title suits, on Wednesday ordered Archaeological Survey of India to include two Muslims in its team engaged in excavation at the disputed site in Ayodhya and appointed two observers to monitor the digging to ""promote transparency"".

The Lucknow Bench of the High Court also rejected ASI''s plea for extension of time from one month to two-and-a-half months for completing the excavation work at the site to ascertain whether a temple existed at the place where the demolished structure was built.

The special bench comprising Justice Sudhir Narain, Justice SR Alam and Justice Banwar Singh said the ASI plea was premature as it had already been given a month''s time and directed it to file the progress report before the court on April seven.

The question of extension, if required, would be looked into then, the court said.

The court appointed two observers to promote transparency in the on-going excavation work on an application moved by the Sunni Central Waqf Board.

It requested the Chief Justice of the Allahabad High Court to spare HS Dubey and MA Siddique, both Additional District Judges as Faizabad, to act as observers as suggested by the Board.

The court while directing ASI to include two Muslims in its team engaged in excavation work also asked it to provide adequate representation to Muslims in the labour force for digging.

18,BJP rules out rivalry angle in Pandya's murder,"NEW DELHI: BJP president Venkaiah Naidu on Wednesday hinted that the ""recent happenings"" in Gujarat might have had something to do with the murder of former Gujarat home minister Haren Pandya though he ruled out the possibility of any ""internal political rivalry"" being the reason.

He claimed that barring Pandya, several Gujarat BJP leaders had been receiving threatening SMS messages after last year''s violence.

This was an answer to questions by reporters on whether the party suspected a terrorist hand or political rivalry being behind the death, especially since both Pandya''s supporters as well as the Congress in the state have linked his murder to his tiff with chief minister Narendra Modi. Modi, it may be mentioned, had been instrumental in Pandya being denied the ticket for last year''s assembly elections.

Indeed, Pandya''s murder appears to have embarrassed the BJP. If initially, party leaders were saying there was no need for a CBI inquiry as the state government was competent to deal with the case, the levelling of charges against Modi has resulted in the order of a CBI inquiry.

Ironically, Pandya was murdered on the day that should have marked his rehabilitation as well as reward for being as Naidu put it a ""disciplined soldier"" of the party. A few days ago, Naidu had informed him that he was being included in the national executive. A formal letter to this effect as well as an invitation to attend next week''s national executive meeting at Indore was to have been sent to Pandya on Wednesday.

Naidu added that this was a prelude to a central appointment, probably that of BJP additional spokesperson. Asked whether this had not gone down well with Modi, Naidu said he had consulted the Prime Minister, the Deputy PM, Modi and Gujarat BJP chief Rajendra Singh Rana about Pandya''s appointment.

Given Pandya''s high profile, several BJP leaders, including Advani, Naidu, law minister Arun Jaitley and senior functionaries Ramdas Aggarwal and Sanjay Joshi will be going to Ahmedabad to attend Pandya''s funeral on Thursday.

Stating that Pandya''s death was a big loss to the party and state, the BJP president said Pandya was ready to accept any responsibility.

19,New road rules for elephants,"NEW DELHI: Elephants will now have to stick to the rules of the road. The traffic police has allowed the movement of elephants only at night and in the afternoon. â€˜â€˜The owners have been asked to stick to the new timings and they have agreed,â€™â€™ said Arun Kampani, deputy commissioner of police (New Delhi range traffic).

In a meeting between elephant-owners and traffic police officers on Wednesday, it was decided that elephants can move freely, only between 10 pm and 6.30 am.

â€˜â€˜During the night, there is less traffic on the roads. They can easily move around and can reach their destinations. If they have to leave for some celebration, they must start early and complete their journeys before vehicular traffic comes on the road,â€™â€™ said a traffic police officer.

If they want to travel during the daytime, they will have to undertake the journey between 12 noon and 3 pm. â€˜â€˜This is a lean traffic period when the pachyderms can walk,â€™â€™ the officer said.

There are about 32 elephants who stay on the banks of Yamuna. Their movement during rush hours has wreaked havoc several times in the past.

â€˜â€˜While there is no clear explanation behind the elephants creating ruckus, we want to be on the safe side,â€™â€™ a traffic police official said. Delhi Police rules say that elephants should not move unless allowed by the traffic police, but the mahouts were not sticking to the guidelines.

Even an authorised owner of an elephant should take care of the pachyderms.

20,Principals debate 20 pc cut in grants,"CHANDIGARH: The Punjab governmentâ€™s decision to impose a 20 per cent cut in the grants given to the non-government colleges in Punjab remained the hot topic for discussion at the Annual Principalsâ€™ Conference held at Panjab University (PU) on Wednesday, even though the vice-chancellor KN Pathak said that the state government was likely to revise its decision as the particular item dealing with colleges in the budget had not been approved by the Punjab Cabinet.

Principals reiterated that the call for strike and boycott of the coming annual examinations would be inevitable if the government did not take timely action release the grant. There was also a consensus by the principals that the higher education was in crisis, especially in Punjab as the consistent increase in fees was no solution to meet the requirements of the colleges.

Principals from both the rural and urban colleges affiliated to PU highlighted the gravity of the situation saying that many rural colleges might close down if the government did not accede to their â€˜genuineâ€™ demands.

They also brought into the notice of the V-C the additional fund, â€˜Punjab Raj Karaj Khed Vikas Fundâ€™, that amounts to Rs 30 per student required by the state government to be paid by the colleges, which would ultimately fall into governmentâ€™s purse.

They also urged to increase the remuneration for the teachers involved in the examination duties and define the clear cut norms to be followed for the external examiners, a concept introduced only this academic session.

The practical relevance of the ten per cent marks awarded in internal assessment of each subject was debated upon and the V-C mooted the idea of including â€˜attendance and regularityâ€™ of students for awarding credits in the assessment, which were based on the marks of house tests alone in the current session.

Principal of DAV College, Sector 10 proposed the idea of having decentralised admissions to BCA, BBA, BCom and MSc (IT) since the number of students seeking admissions in these courses have decreased over the years.

The revision of syllabus from time to time was also discussed and the V-C said that some subjects might see an undated syllabus in the 2003-04 session, which would be in tune with the university guidelines.
