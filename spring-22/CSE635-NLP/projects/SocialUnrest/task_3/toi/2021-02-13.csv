0,French minister gives assurance on turban ban,"NEW DELHI: Reacting to Indian concerns about the recently passed ''secularity'' law banning the ""conspicuous display"" of religious symbols from government schools, visiting French foreign minister Dominique de Villepin said here on Friday that every effort was being made to ensure his country''s 5,000-strong Sikh community is not dishonoured in any way.

The matter was raised by external affairs minister Yashwant Sinha in the hour-long meeting he had with Villepin.

Villepin later told reporters that the French government had already had two meetings with the Sikh community in Paris. ""We will see the best way to answer this question, to show respect for the beliefs of the Sikhs and for the laws and traditions of France.""

The minister, however, stopped short of giving any assurance that Sikh children would be allowed to wear turbans to school from September, when the new law enters into force. What is certain is that the hijab, or head-scarf, worn by some Muslim girls to school, is on the proscribed list. The French concern is that any ''leniency'' shown to the Sikhs would lay school authorities open to charges of discrimination.

Villepin met a Sikh delegation led by Tarlochan Singh, chairman of the National Commission for Minorities.

1,BJP chief may launch daughter into politics,"HYDERABAD: BJP president M Venkaiah Naidu is reportedly planning to launch his daughter Deepa, into active politics. Naidu''s scheduled visit to Nellore on Friday, in the company of three Union ministers, is being read as a step in that direction, sources close to BJP chief told The Times of India.

Union ministers Arun Jaitley, Vijay Goel and Basavangouda Patil are slated to launch various developmental programmes in Nellore district, including a Rs 30-crore international leather complex. Goel''s sports ministry will be spending about Rs 65 lakh on improving games facilities in Nellore town.

Venkaiah Naidu took health minister Sushma Swaraj, information and broadcasting minister Ravi Shankar Prasad and surface transport minister B C Khanduri to Nellore a couple of months ago, where they inaugurated over a dozen Central government-funded programmes worth several crores.

It is being said that Deepa may contest the assembly either from Nellore or Udayagiri, the latter constituency twice represented by her father. Though she lives in Chennai, Deepa is reportedly taking an active part in developmental activities in the district and meeting party leaders. Her husband is a businessman and her family has the Hero Honda dealership in Chennai.

With Nellore Lok Sabha reserved for the scheduled castes and after tasting defeat from Hyderabad Lok Sabha seat (he lost Salahuddin Owaisi of the Mahjlis Ittehadul Muslimeen in the 1996 elections), Venkaiah settled for a Rajya Sabha berth from Karnataka, but he has always wanted a footing in his home district, sources said. He has been visiting Nellore more often than before and meeting party leaders.

Though the TDP has a number of aspirants for the Udayagiri and Nellore seats, sources said Chandrababu Naidu would not mind conceding one of the two seats for his trusted ally. While Udayagiri was held by Kambham Vijayarami Reddy of TDP, Anam Vivekananda Reddy of Congress was the Nellore legislator in the dissolved Assembly.

4,Infighting will make LS polls tough: Khursheed,"CHANDIGARH: Senior Congress leader Salman Khursheed, on Friday, admitted that the infighting in Punjab Congress will make their battle for victory in the ensuing Lok Sabha elections a bit tougher.

Hinting towards efforts to consolidate the relationships among the two factions in the Punjab Congress, Khursheed said that a bandage has been tied and wounds will heal soon.

The All India Congress Working Committee member felt that the unity among the Akalis, the allies of BJP in Punjab, will also add more pressure on the Congress in the elections.

Elaborating on the position of prepoll tie-ups, he said the graph of alliance partners of Congress was going up at most of the places while that of the BJP was declining, with a few exceptions like Punjab.

Khursheed said that at present his party does not have a national alliance like NDA but was making state specific alliance and once the process was complete, a broader national alliance will come up.

""They were able to beat us in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh but now we will defeat them through scientific election management,"" asserted the senior Congress leader.

Rebutting BJP''s prediction of winning more than 300 seats in the elections, Khursheed said that it was going to be close fight but the Congress will manage to win by apprising the voter about the ''reality'' of the BJP''s ''feel good'' factor.

He claimed that the Congress will make a clean sweep in Haryana. He said that he will also recommend the name of Pawan Kumar Bansal for the party ticket for the elections.

Lambasting the BJP for running its first election campaign on government money and issuing insulting statements against Congress chief Sonia Gandhi, Khursheed said, ""We will blunt all their moves and make sure that anybody who sneezes at the wrong place and wrong time is set right.""

Khursheed said that this time the party manifesto will be made interactive to know the view of voters.

""The situation is changing very fast and the biggest challenge of the campaign is that there is no clear wave. We would like to remain maximum in touch with the public,"" he commented.

Congress will be running its campaign not only through advertisements but SMS and e-mail will also be used for spreading the message across the voters.

Referring to the budgetary provision of Rs 15 crore for the construction of chambers for the advocates in the next financial year, Yadav said that this was not done on the basis of any demand but on the basis of his own experiences.

9,Government taken to task for lawlessness,"LUCKNOW: Opposition members in the Vidhan Parishad blamed the government for rising lawlessness, killings, dacoity and crime against women. The situation has come to such a pass that three-month old babies are kidnapped and made victims of lust, said the members.

The five members, Nepal Singh, Rajkumar Tyagi, Raghav Ram Mishra and Sheema Rizvi who had given notice under rule 105 of the House, said that each and every districts of Uttar Pradesh was gripped by incidents of kidnapping and rape.

They said that incident of Lakhimpur-Khiri, where a three-year old girl was criminally assaulted, was the most horrific crime reported in the state in the recent past. Members pointed out that the incidents of Sunehra in Baghpat and Majhola in Moradabad were a blot on civilisation. The incidents of Pratapgarh, Sitapur, Kanpur Dehat and Muzaffarnagar Railway station were the most gruesome crimes to have been committed since the new government has come into being, said the Opposition members.

Speaking on it, Raghav Ram Mishra said that the chief minister''s confidence that he would win over the people by promising them loaves and fishes was misplaced. Each day, crimes, he said, were spreading in new areas but the government continued to be indifferent.

Sheema Rizvi said that the crime against women was bringing disgrace to the the state. Never in the past such incidents were reported at such a large scale, she said. When Rizvi was lashing out at the government, family welfare minister Ahmad Hasan reacted sharply saying that when she was the provost of girls'' hostel, an inmate was kidnapped and criminally assaulted.

10,HC swamped by weighty queries on road tax laws,"KOLKATA: Calcutta High Court may have granted interim relief to the government on collection of lifetime tax on twowheelers, but petitioners against the enhanced tax on four-wheelers seem determined not to give up.

At Justice Bhaskar Bhattacharjeeâ€™s court on Friday, the government cited increased wear and tear of roads and cost of repairs as reasons for the hike in motor vehicles tax. Counsels for the petitioners, however, pointed out that the quantum of tax was now being fixed on the engine capacity of vehicles rather than on weight as earlier. Justice Bhattacharjee asked the government counsel to state the reasons for the change.

Under new rules, fourwheelers not older than 10 years will have to pay a onetime tax for five years. Owners of vehicles older than 10 years can pay taxes annually.

The petitioners argued that owners of 6-9 year old vehicles would have to pay tax for 11-14 years. They called this anomalous and discriminatory.

The petitioners also challenged the governmentâ€™s decision to impose penalty on defaulters. For default beyond 75 days, the penalty was 100 per cent of the tax. They said the government was imposing penalty on tax for later years, which was not yet due.

Advocate P.K. Roy, appearing for the petitioners, submitted that while heavier vehicles were mainly responsible for road damage, the government had decided to tax owners of smaller vehicles for personal use. He pointed out that calculation of tax on cars was now being done on the basis of their cost price. According to rules, the tax (on 800-1,400 cc vehicles) would be three per cent of the sale price (excluding sales tax) or Rs 9,900, whichever was higher.

Justice Bhattacharjee observed that only those buying vehicles at Rs 3,30,000 or less would have to pay a tax of Rs 9,900 or less.

""There are very few vehicles which cost Rs 3,30,000 or lower,â€� Justice Bhattacharjee observed. He also saw no reason in fixing tax on the cost price of vehicles.

17,11 arrested for holding bogus health camp,"SURAT: Eleven persons, including five women, were arrested by the Palsana police for running a bogus medical camp at Vareli village near Palsana on Friday.

They were found administering vaccines purportedly to prevent Hepatitis-B. The main accused who has a Diploma in Homeopathic Medicine and Surgery (DHMS) degree managed to escape from the spot.

Sources said the accused had administered the vaccines to at least 42 persons of the village for a fee of either Rs 50 or Rs 100.

The incident came to light after the talati of the village got suspicious about the authenticity of the persons holding the medical camp. Initially, the women had gone around distributing pamphlets stating that a medical camp against the deadly Hepatitis-B would be held in the village, said sources. Following this, the team started to administer the vaccine at a roadside camp.

Assuming the camp to be an authentic one, the village sarpanch Raju Rathod and talati Ghanshyamsinh Chawda volunteered to provide a room to the team.

However, Chawda got suspicious when he came to know that the â€˜doctorsâ€™ were randomly charging fees between Rs 50 and Rs 100 from the villagers. He, along with a government doctor, approached the Palsana police and brought the matter to their notice.

When the police reached the spot, they found that the degree certificates â€œissued by colleges outside Gujaratâ€� shown by the eleven accused to be fakes.

The arrested have been identified as Anita Nikam, Dr Bhagwan Mahajan, Aabha Singdhane, Laxman Girashe, Ruma Khan, Bhatt Patil, Ratna Chauhan, Anil Yadav, Sambhaji Patil, Vaishali Katve and Sanjay Sonawane while the main accused in the racket, R K Gowda, is absconding. Although both Mahajan and Gowda were doctorates in Homeopathy medicine, they had no authority to undertake vaccination camps.

There is a possibility that more such rackets will be unearthed once Gowda is arrested, added Palsana police. A massive hunt has been launched for Gowda.

Superintendent of police at Surat D J Patel said, â€œWe have seized all the instrument and the drugs being used in the bogus camp. Documents related to their registration have also been seized.â€� Preliminary probe revealed that the camp being held without the necessary registration from the Medical Council of India (MCI), added Patel.
