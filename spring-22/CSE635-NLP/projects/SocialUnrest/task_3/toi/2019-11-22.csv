0,Corporators protest decision on MMRDA,"MUMBAI: Shiv Sena-BJP corporators on Thursday staged a walk-out from the civic general body meeting to protest against the state governmentâ€™s decision to arm the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) with discretionary powers, similar to those exercised by the BMC.

Later, the corporators demonstrated outside the civic headquarters. With the promulgation of an ordinance by the government, MMRDA will be able to carry out construction and widening of roads, implement infrastructure projects. Leader of civic house Prabhakar Shinde criticised the Democratic Front (DF) governmentâ€™s decision as â€œpolitically motivatedâ€™â€™ and said that it representated an attack on the the right of corporators. â€œIf all the powers are given to the MMRDA, the elected representatives will have no role.

In corporation we can discuss and demand the implementation of civic works.â€™â€™ The Sena leaderâ€™s views were echoed by other Sena-BJP corproators, who condemned the government for taking the step.

1,PMT to modify 100 buses to suit disabled,"PUNE: In a welcome move, the Pune municipal transport (PMT) has decided to modify the designs of 100 new buses so that they can be easily accessed by physically challenged people.

The PMT has sought advice on the issue from the Central Institute of Road Transport (CIRT) as well as several non-governmental organisations working for the welfare of physically challenged.

Students of the city-based ILS Law College had filed a petition in the Bombay high court urging it to issue directives to government and semi-government organisations to provide facilities for the physically handicapped. Modification in public transport buses was the main demand of the students.

Fortunately, the commissioner of the state handicapped directorate, Charuchandra Pathak, has been recently transferred as the general manager of the PMT. Pathak, who is well versed with the problems faced by the handicapped, was quick to respond to the demands made by the students.

Speaking to TNN, Pathak said the PMT, in consultation with the CIRT and some NGOs, has worked out an initial modification plan which will be upgraded as and when additional practical suggestions are received.

As per the initial plan, the PMT has decided to widen the front door of 100 buses which are expected to join its fleet in two lots â€” 50 by the end of December and 50 by the end of January.

Physically challenged people will be allowed to enter these buses from the front door so that they are not required to stand in a queue at bus stops. The steps of the front door will be lowered and given a special colour.

The seat arrangements behind the driverâ€™s cabin will be modified and the area will be made more spacious. Five seats behind the driverâ€™s cabin will be strictly reserved for the physically challenged.

A bar will be installed on the top of these seats so that the disabled can take its support while sitting or getting up from their seats. In addition to the changes in the design, Pathak has also issued orders to bus conductors that they personally help the disabled to climb into or alight from the bus.

Pathak pointed out that the PMT provides free service to the blind. It has now decided to provide free bus passes to physically challenged students from standard I to XI.

2,State govt sets sales targets for bars,"PUNE: In a bid to fill up its empty coffers, the Maharashtra government has now trained its guns on liquor shops and bars throughout the state by setting sales targets for them.

Failing to meet the target will mean losing licences. Ironically, the move comes as many as 32 years after prohibition was lifted in the state and restricted sale of liquor was allowed.

A letter in this regard has been sent by the superintendent of excise for Pune district, K.C. Shelar, to restaurants, bar owners and liquor shop owners, in accordance with the circular issued by the state excise commissioner on September 19. The letter was received by the owners of around 70 shops and 450 permit rooms in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad. The letter says, â€œThe sales record of your shop or bar shows that the sale of Indian made foreign liquor (IMFL) is very low. Considering the licence fee and salaries paid by you, besides other expenses incurred in running the business, it seems you are not making any profits. Hence, please explain how you are managing these economically unviable operations.â€�

The shop owners and bar owners have been warned that if their explanation is found to be unsatisfactory, their licences to sell IMFL would be cancelled.

Speaking to TNN, Pune Restaurant and Hoteliersâ€™ Association president Kanakdas Shetty said state excise officials regularly visit shops and bars and say that the minimum purchase of liquor should be worth Rs 2 lakh.

â€œThe state excise authorities donâ€™t understand that at bars, where liquor is sold by the nip (180 ml) system, the sale is high. However, at restaurants, where liquor is sold on a peg basis, the sale is very low because in these restaurants, the profit comes through the sale of food items. So one canâ€™t expect big restaurants and hotels to sell as much liquor as bars do,â€� Shetty argued.

â€œLast week, members of our Mumbai association met the state excise commissioner and told him about our grievances and informed him how it is not possible to meet the targets practically. The commissioner has assured us that he would look into the matter,â€� Shetty added.

Pune District Wine Merchantsâ€™ Association president Raju Pardeshi said that although they had not been given any specific targets, they were asked to increase the sale of some popular brands. â€œWe are compelled to sell bottles from one particular batch within a monthâ€™s time,â€� he said.

Pardeshi said the problem was with the high taxation policy on liquor. â€œThere is excise of almost 170 per cent on liquor in the state and on top of this, one has to pay 20 per cent sales tax, forcing some of the shops and permit rooms to sell liquor banned in the state, or sell even duplicate liquor,â€� he said.

State excise deputy superintendent B.G. Patil told TNN that his department found that the sales figures given by shops and bars lead to the suspicion that they are indulging in malpractices. â€œDuring the inspection of the records of permit rooms, we found that 10 or 15 nips are being sold daily. The price of 10 nips is around Rs 400. Even if we take it for granted that the owner sold these nips at Rs 800, it is very unlikely that he made any profit. This means that the permit room or shop is selling the liquor which is meant to be sold in other state, or selling completely duplicate liquor. To prevent this kind of activity and increase revenue, the government had to take such steps.â€�

He added that such illegal sale of liquor robbed the stateâ€™s revenue in two ways â€” it not only deprived the state of excise revenue, but also of sales tax.

Replying to a question, Patil denied that excise authorities had set any purchase targets for permit room owners.

3,Macmillan sets sights on vernacular book market,"PUNE: Macmillan, the 150-year-old publishing giant, which has a presence in 40 countries, is all set to pump in 35 per cent of its Rs 150-crore annual budget in India for tapping the vast vernacular book market.

Macmillan India Ltd. already has a presence in the vernacular markets in Maharashtra, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal. â€œThe four-year-old Pune office is doing well with 40 Marathi publications under its belt and another 20 are in the pipeline for the year 2003,â€� said Rajiv Beri, managing director, Macmillan India Ltd.

Speaking to TNN during his brief visit to the city, Beri said the decision to tap the vernacular market was taken because the company realised that there was a need for quality publications, especially in the field of education.

â€œAlthough we are primarily catering to primary and secondary state board schools, we are not averse to publishing biographies of great leaders and books on issues of national importance like Aids in Marathi. In fact, we plan to come out with around 10 biographies shortly,â€� he revealed.

Macmillan has tied up with the National Aids Research Institute (Nari) for publishing â€œeasy to understand and accessibleâ€� books in Marathi, Beri said.

Plans are also under way to translate Macmillanâ€™s best-sellers in Marathi. â€œThe Marathi version of Shiv Kheraâ€™s â€˜You can winâ€™, titled as Yash tumchay haati evoked excellent response and so did the book Shivchhatrapati,â€� Beri said, adding that the reader response in Pune went far beyond his expectations with 10,000 copies of the first edition selling in two months.

Asked about the price-conscious book market in Pune, Beri said he saw no problems in convincing people about paying slightly more for quality books. â€œWe are aware that education being the state subject, the governments have monopoly in educational publications. We know the resistance to private publishers in educational books, but are open to joint venture with the government for producing quality books,â€� he observed. About the new trends in educational books, Beri said young teachers were more receptive to good quality books and were willing to experiment with new books. â€œWe find that young teachers are more open to new books, provided they give added benefits to students. And once they are convinced of the quality, they are even ready to reorient themselves and their teaching methods,â€� Beri remarked.

â€œThere is a change in the books also. Educational books have to be more innovative, progressive, interactive, colourful and beautifully structured. That is why a capable editorial team is necessary and institutions like Macmillan score in this aspect,â€� he said, hoping that state governments would be more willing to try services of these editorial teams.

Taking note of the popularity of modern communication methods like the Internet, Macmillan will also be investing significantly in its e-learning initiative. â€œWe have e-learning units dedicated to the development of educational portals for high-level learning. We already have portals for management studies, preparation for competitive examinations and English language teaching for school-teachers,â€� Beri revealed. The company will expand the initiative by providing on-line support material, which is enjoyable as well as informative.

â€œThis service will be available for vernacular readers also,â€� Beri clarified. The focus will be more on providing on-line testing material, evaluation, games and interactive programmes, which can be enjoyed by children, he explained.

4,Veerappan gives govt 12 days to send Mani,"BANGALORE: In an effort to coerce Karnataka into sending jailed Tamil activist Kolathur Mani to negotiate the release of former minister H. Nagappa, brigand Veerappan has set a November 30 deadline with a threat to kill his hostage.

In his fifth cassette, which reached the Karnataka government on Thursday, Veerappan said: â€œMaybe you think that if you delay further, I will give up, leave Nagappa and disappear. You will only get Nagappaâ€™s body if you do not send Mani within 12 days.â€™â€™ The deadline began on November 18.

Veerappan had threatened to kill Nagappa in the first and second cassettes also. The latest cassette was delivered to Nagappaâ€™s wife Parimalaâ€™s relatives in Davanagere. Nagappaâ€™s son Preethan and son-in-law Kiran Patel brought it to Bangalore, but Chief Minister S.M. Krishna was reportedly busy and Home Minister Mallikarjun M. Kharge was in Hyderabad. Education Minister B.K. Chandrashekar was authorised to receive the cassette.

According to sources, Chandrashekar met Nagappaâ€™s family members in Jayanagar to dodge reporters who were waiting at his Banashankari residence. The family later met JD(U) leader P.G.R. Sindhia.

Krishna has convened a meeting on Friday to discuss the issue. At a cabinet meeting on Thursday, Krishna reportedly asked Chief Secretary A. Ravindra to process the cases pending against Mani. The decision comes a day after the pontiffs of various maths urged the CM to accede to Veerappanâ€™s demand to send Mani.

After the cabinet meeting, Kharge reiterated Karnatakaâ€™s offer of legal help and a â€œfree and fairâ€™â€™ trial if Veerappan surrenders.

Earlier, Krishna had ruled out sending any imprisoned person as an emissary.

Tamil Nadu has washed its hands of the emissary issue, with its sole objective being to nab Veerappan. Karnataka is against any STF operations as long as Nagappa is in captivity.

5,Crowd turns violent at Paudwal nite,"RANCHI: It was supposed to be a great night out. The stage was set for the show, and those in the audience were on their feet, eager to see Anuradha Paudwal weave her musical magic. But what happened showed the dark face of Ranchi.

It was about half an hour after the show began that a stone came from nowhere and hit one of the members of the troupe. Soon the crowd turned violent and went on rampage. In a matter of seconds, everything was destroyed. The crowd broke chairs, pelted stones and shattered screens. The so-called elaborate security arrangements proved to be a mockery. As many as 20 constables were hit. SSP M V Rao was hit on the head and chest, and he fell unconscious.

The crowd damaged at least eight police vehicles and tried to set them on fire. The deputy commissioner, Jay Shankar Tiwari, was also hit. The police tried their best to control the crowd, but all their efforts went in vain. Three to four scooters were also damaged by the angry public.

Paudwal was safely taken away from the stage. One of the spectators, who witnessed the ransacking, said that everything was going on fine. It was the police who started all this. A number of people were dangling from the barricade which separated the rest from the seats reserved for VIPs. Without any warning, the policemen started hitting them with sticks.

This angered the crowd, he maintained. Sukant, another spectator, said that 5,000 to 10,000 people, including women, had come from Dhurwa to watch the show. One of the women was allegedly thrashed by a woman police official. Seeing this, the crowd turned violent and started pelting stones at the police personnel. The police personnel also retaliated. Many people were seriously injured in the stampede.

The police failed in their efforts as the crowd was too huge for them to control it.

But the city SP, Ashish Batra, in defence of the police, said that Paudwal had started singing when suddenly a stone was pelted at the stage which hit one of the troupe members. The artist was taken away. The show was stopped for about 40 minutes after which it again commenced. But the people did not calm down. â€œWe tried to stop them, but they became all the more violent, Batra observed. He said that the SSP has been injured but there is nothing to worry.

6,ML leaders mobilise people for Nov 30 rally in Patna,"SAMASTIPUR: The district unit of the CPI-ML (Liberation) and its frontal organisations â€” the Revolutionary Youth Association (RYA), AISA and AIPWA â€” have activated their cadres here to ensure the participation of thousands of people in the CPI-ML sponsored rally in Patna scheduled on November 30.

District secretary of CPI-ML Jitendra Kumar have organised several meetings in different blocks of the district where the party has some influence.

The party leaders are trying to mobilise the people by telling them that communal fascism unleashed by the Sangh Pariwar needs to be countered effectively.

In the meetings, the ML leaders are also raising the issues like the â€œanti-peopleâ€� economic policies of the Centre, the invasion of the Indian markets by foreign companies and American imperialism.

When asked how they could make the illiterate agricultural labourers and peasants in villages understand what the impounding of the economic sovereignty of a nation by imperial forces meant, the CPI-ML leaders said though the job was difficult, they were trying their best to make the people beware of the situation.

Party leaders Surendra Prasad Singh and Purnendu Kumar claimed that at least 500 youths from the district would participate in the partyâ€™s rally on November 30. They said the youths, who have been deprived of proper educational facilities and employment opportunities, were beginning to understand that they had been left in the lurch by those at the helm of affairs in the country.

The party appears to have made a steady progress in the district. It has posed a challenge to the popularity of other Left parties in the district.

The party has also made its presence felt in the CPM stronghold â€” the Bibhutipur assembly constituency â€” from where Ramdeo Verma was elected to the Bihar assembly in the last general elections.

The CPI-ML did not have much success in the last gram panchayat and District Board and nagar panchayat elections here and its performance in the assembly and parliamentary elections has also not been very satisfactory. However, as young people with clean image have come to join the rank and file of the party in recent years, the party has surely made its presence felt in the district.

7,E-Seva gift for US minister,"HYDERABAD: US treasury secretary Paul Oâ€™ Neill had a first hand experience of the stateâ€™s e-Seva service on Thursday.

Neill and US ambassador Robert Blackwill, who visited the e-Seva centre at Khairatabad, furnished their personal details and were given Light Motor Vehicle (LMV) driving licences within five minutes.

As they showed their driving licences issued in the United Sates, they did not have to undergo the driving test which is mandatory for prospective drivers in the city, said joint transport commissioner C L N Gandhi.

However, the government paid the service charge of Rs 780 for both licences, since the dignitaries were state guests.

I am impressed with the way technology is being used here. I have not seen any thing like this before. The ambience of the e-Seva centre does not look like that of a government office,"" commented Neill after visiting the centre.

He appreciated the technological convergence of state and local services under one roof in order to make all government transactions easier.

""They were impressed with the way e-Seva centres were providing services to citizens and has even invited us to demonstrate the project in the United States,"" said e-Seva director Phani Kumar.

The director said that 20 more services such as darshan tickets for Lord Venkateswara at Tirumala, railway reservations, movie tickets, insurance payments etc would be added soon in addition to selling applications for EAMCET examination.

The government would join hands with banks to offer online services to account holders, he said.

8,"Red alert in city, VHP calls for bandh","HYDERABAD: A red alert has been sounded here and neighbouring Ranga Reddy district and a strict vigil is being maintained at all places of worship in the wake of a bomb blast at a parking lot near Sai Baba temple on the city outskirts on Thursday night, killing a woman and injuring 20 others.

With the needle of suspicion pointing towards involvement of ISI agents to ''foment communal trouble'', special search teams have been formed to nab the culprits who had set off a time-bomb placed in a scooter parked near the boundary wall of the temple packed with devotees.

""We do not want to take any chance. All the vehicles leaving the city are being checked and the police in neighbouring districts are also put on high alert,"" a top police official said.

Meanwhile, the police on Friday said a second bomb planted in a Maruti car parked nearby had failed to explode and it had since been defused.

As the blast ripped through the parking area of the temple, located barely a few yards away from Saroornagar police station, a temple worker Padmamma (40) was killed and 20 others received burn injuries and the condition of four of them was stated to be serious.

The city unit of VHP called for bandh on Friday even as the explosion triggered panic in the city.

After visiting the blast site, state Home Minister T Devender Goud told reporters late last night that the blast appeared to be the handiwork of an ''organised gang bent upon creating trouble''.

9,BJP confident of forming government in Gujarat,"AHMEDABAD: Gujarat Minister of State for Home Goberdhan Jhadafiya on Friday said that the BJP was confident of a ""thumping victory"" in the coming December 12 Assembly elections in the state.

Jhadafiya said that he was confident that there would be a ""definite division of votes"". ""We (BJP) are not going to get minority votes in the polls but even then we will win with a thumping majority,"" he said.

Replying to a question, he said that the report of Concerned Citizens'' Tribunal, headed by Justice Krishna Iyer, holding the Modi government responsible for post-Godhra violence ""would not"" have any effect on the outcome of the polls.

When asked about the growing resentment in the party over distribution of tickets, including absence of former minister of state for home Haren Pandya''s name in the list so far, Jhadafiya said that he was sure that ""Pandya will get the ticket"" but did not comment on the constituency.

He said that unrest among party members over ticket distribution ""is momentary and things will settle down"".

10,India should increase spending on public health: Sachs,"NEW DELHI: India needs to increase its spending on public health which would in fact, be an investment for future economic success, Advisor to the Global Fund for AIDS, TB and Malaria Jeffrey Sachs said.

""I am a big proponent of India achieving 8 per cent growth,"" Sachs said during a teleconference from New York on Thursday on the eve of the World Economic Forum India Summit which starts on Sunday next here.

India with its less than 1 per cent of GDP spending on public health lagged behind several other developing countries which spend about 4 per cent and developed nations which spend about 7 per cent, he said.

""Public health expenses should not be seen just as an expense, but as an investment for overall economic success,"" Sachs said adding in its absence, other economic boosters would not have the desired impact on the overall economy.

Apparently referring to the AIDS controversy and Bill Gates'' announcement of aid to India to fight the disease, Sachs said India had many friends worldwide who were concerned and standing by to extend help required in its fight against TB, malaria and HIV/AIDS.

Some of the required money could also come as grants from the newly formed Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria and from the new grants programme of World Bank, he said.

However, bulk of the new financial support would need to come from increased budgetary support from within India.

""The Central Health Minister and the Finance Minister need to work together with the state chief ministers to develop effective public health programmes.""

11,Tehelka accuses govt of abuse of power,"NEW DELHI: Tehelka Managing Editor Tarun Tejpal on Friday alleged that ""the government''s abuse of power against the news portal in last two years is much bigger a story than its expose on corruption in defence deals"" and the recent appointment of Justice K Venkatswami as Chairman of an important financial body was no different.

""I am not surprised by anything the government does against us. We are not expecting any fair play from the government who has abused its powers in every possible way against us,"" Tejpal said while reacting to the report of government appointing Venkatswami, heading the commission probing into the allegations of corruption in defence deals, as chairman of an important financial body.

Earlier in the day, both the houses of the Parliament witnessed noisy protests by the opposition who criticised the government for appointing Venkatswami as Chairman of Authority of Advance Ruling on Customs and Central Excise.

12,VHP plans to sue Citizens Tribunal for riot report,"AHMEDABAD: The VHP on Friday attacked the tribunal of eminent citizens which held the Modi government and Sangh Parivar outfits responsible for the post-Godhra violence, saying its report has been prepared with the backing of ""Jehadi-fundemantalists and pseudo secularists"" and threatened ""legal action"" against those behind it.

""This report is prepared with superficial information and with the backing of jehadi-fundamentalists and pseudo-secularists and is intended to malign my image, our organisation and the sentiments of Hindus all over"", VHP International General Secretary Praveen Togadia told reporters here.

The nine-member ''Concerned Citizens Tribunal Gujarat 2002'', headed by Justice Krishna Iyer in its report released on Thursday had held Chief Minister Narendra Modi, his cabinet colleagues and organisations like the BJP, the RSS, the VHP and the Bajrang Dal ""directly responsible for the post Godhra carnage"".

He said those behind the report would have to tender an ""unconditional"" apology or defamation charges might be slapped against them.

""My lawyers will decide on the legal action to be taken against them in a day or two and we expect them to tender an apology by then"", Togadia said.

13,Tribunal can’t conduct inquiry: State govt,"AHMEDABAD: The Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), which has been indicted along with Chief Minister Narendra Modi by the Concerned Citizenâ€™s Tribunal in connection with the communal riots triggered off by the Godhra massacre, is seriously contemplating to file a defamation suit against the tribunal.

The VHP also plans to urge G T Nanavati Commission, which is probing the riots, to verify the facts submitted by over 2,000 people who supposedly deposed before the tribunal.

Addressing a crowded news conference, VHP international general secretary Pravin Togadia described the tribunal report as nothing else but a copy of â€œcommunal combatâ€�. He described it as â€œan anti-Hindu pamphlet aimed at maligning Hindu organisations and its functionariesâ€�. â€œWe have decided to take legal advice from leading lawyers on the report and then, file a defamation suit against those who have brought out this report,â€� he said.

The VHP leader alleged that the tribunal has released the report â€œkeeping an eye on Gujarat elections to help the Congress party headed by Sonia Gandhi and also to encourage Pakistan President General Pervez Musharraf to dispatch more terriorists to Gujaratâ€�.

He claimed that in the report, there was no mention about the Godhra massacre and elements like Tableegh Jamat which had perpetrated the gruesome act.

He said, â€œThe report was a heinous attempt at protecting the role of radical Islamists of the Tableegh in the Godhra killings and thus, projecting the perpetrators of the crime as victims.â€� The Tableegh ideology was responsible for the growing Islamic fundamentalism in the country, including Godhra, he added.

Togadia has also questioned the credentials of some of the members of the tribunal like Dr Indukumar Jani, Fr Cedric Prakash and Uvesh Sareshvala. He said the tribunal member, K G Kannabiran, has been providing cover to the naxalite movement in Andhra Pradesh and Teesta Setalvad had defamed Gujarat at the international level.

Referring to his name and that of state health minister Ashok Bhatt and former minister of state for home Haren Pandya in the tribunal report, Togadia said that during the period of riots, he was in Ayodhya while Bhatt and Pandya have not indulged in any violence. He said he was prepared to show a video cassette of his speech in Tarsali which has been described as â€œhighly incitingâ€� by the tribunal.

Meanwhile, state BJP president Rajendrasinh Rana said that the tribunal report was politically motivated and the findings would only add fuel to the fire in Gujarat.

14,Sabarkantha dist worst-hit in riot,"AHMEDABAD: Unprecedented security will mark the much-watched assembly elections in Gujarat on December 12 with armed police forces from five states besides personnel involved in gathering military intelligence and the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) camping here till the electoral process is over, sources told TNN.

After a detailed assessment made by the full team the Election Commission about the security issues nagging the state after the prolonged communal riot, 353 companies of central para-military forces are scheduled to arrive in the state by the end of this month.

Considering the security threat on the state after the communal riots and the terror attack on the Akshardham temple complex on September 24, the EC chalked out a detailed plan for the state for the elections.

The Sabarkantha district has been judged as the worst-affected by the communal riots and hence the most sensitive as far as elections are concerned, according to top police sources. Intelligence reports on the spread of communal violence in this district have shown it as having the maximum impact, followed by Mehsana, Vadodara and Ahmedabad.

An independent assessment by the EC shows some 8,000 locations spread over 1,700 villages, 110 towns and five cities including Ahmedabad, Vadodara, Rajkot, Surat and Bhavnagar as being the most sensitive as far as elections are concerned.

Till date already some 75 companies including some nine companies of the ITBP have arrived, of which six are likely to be in Ahmedabad, though the distributions are not yet finalised.

According to Director General of Police K Chakravarthi, ""the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) will dominate with 125 companies, 50 companies of the BSF besides armed police force from Punjab, Haryana, Karnataka, Rajasthan and Maharashtra states."" There will 60 companies of the SRP and 18 of the Border Wing (Home Guards) deployed from the state.

Sources say there are also plans to deploy members from the Special Services Bureau (SSB) in the border states, considering the vulnerability of the state after the terror attacks on the Parliament and in Akshardham.

""The plan is to have 10 villages patrolled by a group mobile equipped with wireless systems and comprising five home guards, one assistant sub-inspector and a subinspector,"" Chakravarthi said. All supervising officers will be given striking forces so that they can act independently and immediately, when trouble strikes, he said.

15,Acquitted riot-accused returns as BJP candidate,"LUNAWADA: On March 3, Arzuben sobbed inconsolably in a dingy room of the Khanpur police station as she recounted to the police the horror of witnessing her family members being attacked and burnt by a mob at the Limbadiya Chowkdi.

It was hard for many here to come to terms with that ghastly incident of March 2 that saw about 40 people, including children,who were fleeing for life, being burnt alive in a vehicle. Nine months later, another incident leaves a large number of Lunawadaâ€™s residents stunned.

The man who is moving from door to door asking for votes for the BJP â€” Kalubhai Maliwad â€” was the one who Arzuben had claimed in her statement to have been a part of the mob that attacked them and killed her husband and members of her family. Maliwad, who has spent about seven months in jail, however, has been acquitted of all the charges, including murder, by the court.

Supporters of the 46-year-old school teacher claim that he was framed. Many say that the courtâ€™s verdict says it all. Maliwad himself feels that apart from the court acquitting him, his ""voters know very well that he is â€˜nirdoshâ€™."" ""I donâ€™t know what effect the FIR and my jail term will have on my prospects. It is for the voters to decide and they all known that I was framed,"" Maliwad told TNN just after filing his nomination paper here on Friday.

But, there are still many who arenâ€™t convinced. ""We can never consider ourselves safe if such a person wins. By offering him a ticket, the BJP wanted to prove that none from their ranks were involved in the riots,"" says Mohammad Ilyas Usman Sibahi, who was Maliwadâ€™s teacher in Khanpur.

Arzuben had mentioned in her FIR that when at Limbadiya Chowkdi, a mob attacked the vehicle they were fleeing in from Kidiyad in Sabarkantha district, she managed to hide behind a roadside shop. ""When the crowd attacked the Tempo, I heard somebody from the mob shouting Kalubhai Maliwad, pass the can of kerosene,"" the FIR said. Charges ranging from murder, rioting with arms and mischief with fire were levelled against Maliwad.

The jail term before his acquittal came as a blot in his two-decade career. He joined the Congress and was a close aide of the Maharaja of Lunawada Dhirendrasinhji, along with the sitting MLA Surpalsinh Solanki.

He shifted his allegiance to the BJP when the Congress denied him a ticket during the 1998 elections. He put in his might behind BJP MP from Godhra Bhupendrasinh Solanki during the general elections in 1999 and in turn, it was Bhupendrasinh, who fought the case for Kalubhai in the Godhra district court.

""He may have been acquitted by the district court. He may also get acquitted in higher courts. But, he can never escape the court of the Almighty. He has to answer him,"" says Abdullah Shaikh, a resident of Madhvas Darwaja, right next to the G U Patel High School, that was turned into a large relief camp in the wake of the riots.

16,SC asks WB govt to shut down Kolkata tanneries,"NEW DELHI: About 600 leather tanneries polluting the river Hoogly in Kolkata will now be shut down. The Supreme Court on Friday pulled up the West Bengal government for showing laxity in implementing its orders for the closure of these tanneries by February 28.

The court has asked the state government to take immediate steps including ""seize and seal"" procedures to close the polluting tanneries. The matter will be heard on December 3.

""There is some laxity on the part of the state government in implementing the court order. We direct the state government to implement the order and see that the tanneries do not function in the areas where they had been directed to be closed,"" a Bench of Justices M B Shah and Justice D M Dharmadhikari said.

In 1996 , the court had ordered the closure of tanneries and their shifting to a new modern complex built on equal cost sharing by the state and the Centre.

The court asked the affected Association of Tannery Holders (ATH) to file their replies within 15 days regarding voluntary closure of their establishments tanneries, whose effluent discharge was polluting the Hoogly river.

""It will be open to the authorities to evict the persons and stop operation of the tanneries in the area in question. If they do not close their tanneries, then it would be open to them to seize and seal the premises and they will not be entitled to any stay from the courts,"" the Bench said.

The court had earlier asked the government to disconnect the electricity and water supplies to these units to force them to relocate into the modern complex, which was equipped with Common Effluent Treatment Plants (CETPs).

The state government''s Advocate General said that the government had disconnected the electricity and water supplies to these tanneries but they appeared to be operating by using hand-pumps and drawing electricity illegally.

Though the AG said that all facilities were provided at the new complex but the tannery holders were refusing to shift, the ATH contended that the facilities at the new complex were not complete and despite payment of all the charges, the government had not allotted them plots.

The court explained that its directive was unconditional to the extent that even if the new complex was not ready, the tanneries must close down.

18,"Mayhem at HC, call for Bar re-election","CHANDIGARH: Utter pandemonium prevailed at the high court on Friday as a section of lawyers contesting the Bar Council of Punjab and Haryana elections complained of bogus voting by unauthorised persons.

They also alleged that scores of voters had mocked the election process by indulging in multiple voting.

Contestants deplored the entire polling arrangement and went to the extent of saying that the show was stage-managed by sitting bar council members to their own advantage, even as the latter rebuffed the allegation strongly.

The day had started off fairly well. With the exception of some voters decrying the election arrangements, polling progressed smoothly in the morning. Contestants were in fine fettle, making last-ditch efforts to garner a few extra votes.

But, it was not long before voters began rushing pell-mell inside the voting hall. The ''anarchy'' prompted some contenders to raise slogans against the returning officer, the assistant returning officer and the incumbent bar council management.

Sukhdeep Singh Bhinder, a first time contestant, said, ""Confusion arising from electoral mismanagement was the highlight of the day. Several voters were pressurised to mark their ballot in favour of influential candidates. To say the least, the election was not transparent.""

Taken together, over 15 complaints were handed out to returning officer Nirmal Singh Dhillon. These related to lawyers possessing double votes and discrepancies in the electoral roll.

Harbhajan Singh Dhandi, another contestant griped, ""Bogus and multiple voting have counteracted the pre-election hard work put in by genuine contenders. The slog has come to zilch.""

Disillusioned with the manner in which the bar council election was allegedly conducted, a number of candidates felt a re-poll ought to be conducted. P S Goraya tendered an application to the returning officer demanding a re-poll.Former bar association president Daya Chaudhary said, ""This poll was a farce. Its outcome is a foregone conclusion. We have a right to a free and fair election, which is why we are asking for a re-poll.""

Dismissing the pejorative remarks as unmerited, bar council honorary secretary C M Munjal insisted the poll was transparent and had not been engineered.

Munjal said voters not carrying valid identity documents could be held responsible for the eleventhhour chaos. Interestingly, three persons were found sauntering inside the voting hall without any documents.

They were dragged out and beaten up by supporters of contestants before being shooed away from the court premises. Another person snatched the ballot paper and ran away. A case has been registered.

19,Probe ordered into Indian Medical Association polls,"MUMBAI: President-elect of the Indian Medical Association (IMA)-Maharashtra Dr Dilip Guha has ordered an inquiry into allegations of bogus voting during the IMAâ€™s annual conference at Sangli last week. There are allegations that at least two of the voters were not even members of the IMA, but were drivers. The conference was held to elect office-bearers of the IMAâ€™s state chapter.

The organisers were tipped off that some of the voters were not genuine and subsequent investigations revealed that two men, who were registered as doctors from the IMAâ€™s Mumbai suburban-west branch, were bogus. They were detained by the organisers and interrogated for nearly three hours, during which they admitted that they were not really doctors but had come to vote for Dr Vasant Shenoy. Dr Shenoy is the general secretary of the Mumbai suburban west branch, which has the largest membership in Maharashtra. Dr Shenoy said he had nothing to do with the two men.

Dr Guha, who is based in Nagpur, told TNN that the two controversial members had paid Rs 500 each towards registration for attending the conference. â€œHow could all this have happened?â€™â€™ he wondered. Dr Guha said Dr Shenoy may have been made a scapegoat since there is intense rivalry between the various IMA branches. Since the Mumbai suburban (west) branch has the largest number of members, it is possible that a rival faction may have wanted to portray it in a poor light. After the bogus voting came to light, Dr Guha also received complaints that the Pune list contained the names of three persons who were not doctors. He said the inquiry would also look into this complaint. Sources said many doctors aspired to become office-bearers of IMA because of the money associated with the many pharmaceutical firms that sponsor events.

The IMA is a non-governmental organisation of doctors. It has 1.5 lakh members in India and is consulted by policy makers. The developments have sent shock waves through the medical fraternity. Senior members claim that such infighting and underhand ways are indicative of the malaise that has crept into this body of professionals. â€œBut when the entire nation is in a similar state, why single out doctors alone?â€™â€™ asked Dr C.R. Joshi, former freedom fighter and IMA veteran. Dr Joshi said the organisers at Sangli should have called in the police. But they did not do so because of the adverse publicity that the arrests would entail.

Incidentally, elections three years ago to the Maharashtra Medical Council, a quasi-judicial body, were scrapped by the Bombay high court on charges of bogus voting. The council has been run by a government-appointed administrator ever since.

20,4 arrested for medical student's rape,"NEW DELHI: The Delhi police on Friday arrested four prime suspects in connection with the rape of a Maulana Azad Medical College student last week. And, according to the police, it was not just a rape incident, but a case of rape-cum-robbery.

Police commissioner R S Gupta said: ""Interrogation of the accused has disclosed that four persons were involved in the rape, not three as thought initially. Two of them are majors, while two are minors. All four are residents of the slum clusters near Delhi Gate."" The victim was allegedly raped on the terrace of the Khooni Darwaza, opposite the MAMC campus gate.

Gupta said, ""The accused have disclosed that they were waiting in the park, adjacent to the monument, with the intention to rob women who passed by the area. They had also planned to rape the victim.""

The accused had robbed the victim of her purse, containing Rs 100, and her mobile phone. The police have recovered the victim''s purse.

The police chief said two of the accused, Rahul (20) and Amit (19), are friends and reside in the same locality near the Delhi Gate slum clusters. Amit had slapped the victim and one of the minors had molested her.

Gupta said the investigation was constrained by the fact that the victim was yet to appear for her examinations and her assistance could not be sought in investigations. ""However, the district police in coordination with the crime branch teams, on the basis of available clues, rounded up the suspects. In all, 14 teams were fanned out in the city,"" Gupta said.

The main accused, Rahul, was arrested first, and his interrogation led to the arrest of three of his accomplices. Rahul is a resident of Harijan Basti, near Delhi Gate, and was involved in two burglary cases.

21,Kashmir panel rules out independence,"SRINAGAR: Kashmir Committee on Friday held another round of inconclusive talks with separatist leadership here with its leader Ram Jethmalani ruling out the option for independence and Shabir Shah claiming that six member delegation had accepted the disputed nature of Kashmir.

In an apparent rebuff to JKLF chairman Yaseen Malik, Kashmir Committee chairman Jethmalani ruled out the option of independence for Kashmir saying independence can be achieved only from injustice and oppression.

He said the breakthrough in the ongoing stalemate could be achieved only when the two sides (government of India as well as separatists) give up the hard line and extreme stands. â€˜â€˜We have to find a middle path. We will sit and ask the separatists who have snatched their freedom,â€™â€™ he said.

Asked about the recent outburst of JKLF chairman against the Kashmir Committee, Jethmalani said: â€˜â€˜Malikâ€™s way of thinking has changed during his detention. He will realize improvement in the situation once he moves around.â€™â€™

Jammu and Kashmir Democratic Freedom Party president, Shabir Shah after his nearly four-hour meeting with Kashmir Committee claimed that the two parties had agreed Kashmir was a disputed issue and could be resolved only through tripartite talks involving India, Pakistan and Kashmiri represenatives.

22,Russian minister finalises several defence deals,"NEW DELHI: India and Russia have ""nearly finalised"" several major defence contracts, apart from discussing ""new and promising joint projects"" to develop high-tech weapon systems, said Russian industry, science and technology minister Ilya Klebanov on Friday evening.

Klebanov, who is here in the run up to President Vladimir Putinâ€™s visit to New Delhi early next month, however, did not spell out the different defence deals in the pipeline.

The two countries have been bargaining hard over the pricing of this package deal, which includes the retrofitting of the 44,570-tonne decommissioned aircraft carrier and the supply of MiG-29K fighters and Kamov helicopters to arm it, after settling technical parameters several months ago.

Other deals being discussed include the procurement of the Russian â€˜Smerchâ€™ multi-launch rocket systems and the Amur class submarines.

India also wants the delivery schedules and the licensed production arrangements for the Sukhoi-30MKI fighter jets and the T-90S main battle tanks to be speeded up.

India is also keen on leasing TU-22m3 long-range strategic bombers and nuclear submarines from Russia.

Sources said Indian officials also asked the Russians to sort out the glitches in the

""Shtil"" surface-to-air missile systems aboard the two ""stealth"" frigates, INS Talwar and INS Trishul, soon.
