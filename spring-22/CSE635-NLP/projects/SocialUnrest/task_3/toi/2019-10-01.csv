0,RSS affiliates slam Central govt policies,"LUCKNOW: The Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS), the Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS) and the Swadeshi Jagran Manch (SJM) took to streets on Monday to oppose the policies of the union government, led by the BJP. Incidentally, all the four are linked with the RSS.

At a well-attended rally, speakers came down heavily on the union government and accused it of bowing down to the US pressure and not being able to defend the just rights of the countryâ€™s farmers and labour class. Launching a scathing attack on the government, founder of the BMS Dattopant Thengdi said that India should opt out of the World Trade Organisation (WTO).

â€œThe WTO has become a fiefdom of a handful of developed nations and there is no place for developing countries like India,â€� he added. He also mooted formation of a new group of developing countries which could take the hegemony of the developed nations head on.

â€œThe effort of the government on this count has been poor so far,â€� Thengdi said, though he later lauded the efforts of the union industry minister Murasoli Maran in championing their cause in Doha.

Liberalisation, speakers added, had sounded a death knell for labour class and farmers and, therefore, had to be reversed.

The mob, with the support of corporator Manubhai Rathod, then attacked the Gujarat Electricity Board team and looted the meters that had been seized by the raiding party. By the time the police arrived, the mob had dispersed along with the meters.

The Gujarat Electricity Board team, outnumbered by the mob and still recuperating from the sudden attack, have stated that they would not conduct further raids unless they are provided necessary police protection.

An action plan is being formulated to conduct raids with the help of police, but till then the raids have been halted.

3,Property worth Rs 31 cr lost in 44 riots,"MUMBAI: Maharashtra has lost property worth Rs 31.5 crore in the 44 communal riots that have taken place since the Democratic Front came to power in October 1999, an official note reveals.

The majority community lost property valued at Rs 13.23 crore while the loss of minorities was about Rs 17.22 crore, according to official estimates. The damage to government property was estimated over a crore of rupees.

The riots claimed 41 lives; at least 17 of the victims died in police firing. About 1,065 people were injured.These incidents resulted in the police registering 662 cases and arresting 4,144 accused. About 4,000 others were put under preventive detention.

By comparison, during the rule of the Shiv Sena and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) between March 1995 and September 1999, there were only 25 major riots in Maharashtra. These claimed 17 lives and resulted in property valued at Rs 68.60 lakhs being lost.

Official statistics reveal that in these riots, the majority community lost property worth Rs 68.60 lakh while the minorities lost property valued at Rs 30.09 lakhs. The damage to government property was valued at about Rs 5.52 lakh.

During the the first two years and 10 months of the Shiv Sena-BJP rule, only 18 major riots had broken out in the state, killing 12 persons and resulting in the loss of Rs 31 lakh.

The majority community lost property amounting to Rs 22.82 lakh, while the minorities lost property valued at Rs 6.34 lakh. The government suffered a loss of Rs 27,600.

While chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh and deputy CM Chhagan Bhujbal were unavailable for comment, some prominent DF leaders blamed the Sena, the BJP and the sangh parivar organisations like the Vishwa Hindu Parishad and the Bajrang Dal for fomenting trouble in the state.

DF leaders reason that the riots will naturally be more frequent when those responsible for them (read the Sena and the sangh parivar fronts) are outside the government and have nothing else to do but spread hatred and discredit the government.

However, a senior official told TNN that the government has moved swiftly to contain the activities of communal organisations. â€œWe were the first to recommend to the Centre to ban the rabidly communal Students Islamic Organisation of India (SIMI),â€™â€™ the official pointed out.

The state police curbed the activities of the Deendar Anjuman after the Centre banned it in April 2001 under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967. It banned SIMI in September.

4,Bhatia waiting for final order since '99,"PUNE: Seeking compulsory retirement of bureaucrat Arun Bhatia, the Maharashtra government has sent the case and documents to the Union government pertained to an inquiry ordered in 1990.

The charges which were inquired into included â€˜making false allegations against senior officers for not taking action in corruption cases when no action was taken in the FSI scandal case concerning residential buildings of IAS officers exposed by Bhatia in 1984) and checking other records to detect other FSI scandals.

Besides, the charges also include making false allegation regarding the construction of an illegal building by the Charleville housing society of senior IAS officers, going to Mumbai on personal work showing it as duty, use of government stationery for private purpose, criticising the government in the press, bringing political pressure in his service matters among others.

In his letter to the prime ministerâ€™s office (PMO) on September 2 this year, Bhatia had pointed out that when he resumed duty in India in 1988 after a four-year stint with the United Nations, he found that no action had been taken about the FSI violations even as his promotion was blocked.

Significantly, the Central Administration Tribunal (CAT) ordered the government to promote him when he complained to the CAT. The government then ordered an inquiry in 1990 on the above-mentioned charges. Bhatia pointed out that the CAT order was issued even after the governmentâ€™s charges against Bhatia were shown to CAT.

In 1999, after the Bombay high court ordered reinstatement of Bhatia as Pune municipal commissioner, the government appointed a retired judge to complete the nine-year-old inquiry. He was held guilty of charges by holding ex parte proceedings in June 1999 and Bhatia was denied access to documents.

Since 1999, Bhatia has been waiting for the final orders of the government for announcing the punishment. The file has been travelling between the state government, central government and the UPSC.

Bhatia pointed out that the punishments recommended by various authorities ranged from stopping two increments to compulsory retirement for the same charges. â€œIn this process, I have again lost my promotion and about 30 juniors have been promoted over my headâ€�, he said in his letter to the prime minister.

He has also remarked that the UPSC recommended compulsory retirement because there is a member with whom he had a conflict when Bhatia was not allowed to complete a dissenting note in a meeting to evaluate an officer who Bhatia said was honest and facing victimisation.

Bhatia stated that the reason behind all this was that he has continued to pursue corruption cases detected by him in his earlier postings.

5,BJP wants MSP for farmers to be revised,"HYDERABAD: The president of the state unit of Bharatiya Janata Party, C Ramachandra Reddy on Monday urged the central government to effect an upward revision of the minimum support price for farmers in the wake of extreme drought situation prevailing in the state.

In a letter to Union minister of Agriculture Ajit Singh, Reddy said that the committee on agriculture costs and prices (ACP) had recommended the same level of MSP as that of last year.

It may be recalled that the MSP for last year was Rs 560 for A grade rice and Rs 530 for the common variety. Reddy said that the ACPâ€™s decision would affect the interests of the farmers adversely.

He said the cost of inputs had gone up, and this fact was not taken into consideration by the ACP. Hence, it was necessary that the Union government take a relook at the issue, Reddy added.

Reddy also urged the All India Bharatiya Janata Party president, M Venkaiah Naidu to take up the matter with the government.

6,Dalit Mahasabha rally in Guntur on Tuesday,"GUNTUR: The Dalit Mahasabha would hold a rally at Gunta Ground in Guntur on Tuesday, demanding ban on liquor.

Dalit Mahasabha general secretary Katti Padma Rao said on Monday that the response from women to the DMS agitation has been more than expected.

He said that the government, which came to power with the help of women, ditched them by opening liquor shops at every nook and corner.

Ban on liquor is a prime demand in their agitation. He said that the rural economy was ruined because of the policies of the government, and women were the worst sufferers because of economic reforms intitiated by the central government.

He said that the Dalit Mahasabha floated a womanâ€™s outfit a few months ago, demanding distribution of surplus lands, pension to every woman, and also a house site.

The Dalit Mahasabha succeeded in attracting nearly one lakh women as its members, he said.

In an effort to prepare women for long-term agitations, a woman team leader has been appointed for every 10 members.

11,Probe sought into S-I selection exam,"THRISSUR: Kerala Youth Congress president P V Anilkumar on Tuesday sought a detailed inquiry into the alleged irregularities in the written examination conducted by the Public Service Commission for sub-inspectors.

He told a press conference here that there had been widespread complaints from various quarters regarding the irregularities. The test was conducted two months ago.

Anilkumar said that the government should either take steps to fill up all the vacancies in various departments, or appoint those who had received advice memo from the PSC. Though the government had decided to fill up 50 per cent of the vacancies in various departments, that was not enough, as over 45 lakh youth were unemployed, he said.

12,Fresh packed mutton sale through govt outlets soon,"BANGALORE: Meat-eaters needn''t panic any more on the quality of red meat and the hygienic methods adopted by vendors in the local market. The Karnataka Sheep and Sheep Products'' Development Board plans to sell authorised, fresh, packed mutton at competitive rates in over 1,000 outlets across the state, president Y.N. Gowdar said.

The proposal is to be implemented at a proposed cost of Rs 10.15 crore. The board has brought in sweeping changes in the management to regulate sheep-rearing and meat consumption in the state. It plans to set up 200 mutton and wool marketing societies throughout Karnataka.

According to officials, the board has set up about 125 societies. Two lakh farmers will work with the board to rear and market the Rambulae variety mutton and wool.

The societies will buy and sell sheep at a proposed cost of Rs 3.58 crore. The board has distributed special ration cards to these sheep farmers, who will periodically register facts and figures of their farms for the board''s perusal.

``Medicine and other technical expertise will be provided by the veterinary department in the respective jurisdictions,'''' Gowdar said.

At present, not many meat vendors in local markets take up quality control tests or obtain the mandatory approval of veterinarians before animals are slaughtered for meat consumption.

``Also because sheep are most susceptible to anthrax, the board found it fit to regulate the business,'''' he pointed out, adding that the new system is expected to do away with touts.

The societies will also encourage sale of Rambulae wool, said to be the best quality wool in the world. ``The board will conduct massive awareness programmes to introduce to the farmers the Rambulae variety of sheep. Most farmers still adopt old and conventional practices of wool weaving, extracted from other variety, which virtually has no market value,'''' said the board''s deputy director Jagannath.

Based on the approval from the Central Wool Board, the state is expected to execute the work by mid-October.

14,"MSP a 'cruel joke' on farmers, says Amarinder","KHANNA: Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh on Tuesday termed the relief of Rs 20 per quintal above the minimum support price (MSP) on paddy announced by the Centre, as a â€œcruel jokeâ€� on farmers.

Addressing a news conference after launching paddy procurement here, the chief minister, trying to dispel the notion that the relief was announced due to SAD president Parkash Singh Badal, said it had already been fixed by the Abhijit Sen committee constituted by the Centre.

The chief minister said that his government would continue its struggle for acceptance of its demand of increasing the MSP to Rs 760 per quintal besides scrapping the new formula of MSP plus 4 per cent taxes/levies and relaxation in specifications of paddy procurement.

He pointed out that the farmers would get a maximum of Rs 600 per acre which was peanuts as compared to the additional cost of about Rs 3000 per acre incurred by them.

Ridiculing the central governmentâ€™s apathy, he repeated the allegations of step-motherly treatment to the state at the behest of Badal. It was for this reason that the procurement was â€œdeliberately delayedâ€� by 10 days from the September 21 date during Badalâ€™s tenure as chief minister. And while 28 lakh tonne of paddy was procured by September 30 last year, it was reduced to just about 6 lakh tonne this time, which, too, was below the MSP.

Amarinder Singh alleged that Badal was keeping company of anti-Punjab leaders like Andhra Pradesh and Haryana chief ministers Chander Babu Naidu and Om Prakash Chautala. And said that Naidu had even refused to purchase paddy from Punjab dubbing it inferior in quality.

In context of Badalâ€™s role in securing relief, Amarinder Singh said if Badal wanted to project himself as saviour of farmers, then, why did he not withdraw support to the NDA government and direct Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa to quit the Union cabinet.

Earlier, addressing the farmers, the chief minister said his government would press the Centre to compensate the farmers who had to sell their paddy below the MSP from September 21. Assuring the farmers that their paddy would not be lifted below MSP, he urged them not to be misled by false propaganda of SAD leaders.

He informed them that he had deputed all ministers and MLAs to oversee procurement operations in their constituencies.

The chief minister launched procurement with the sale of 8 paddy heaps at Rs 560-578.

17,"Shop now, but with kepmars in mind","KOLKATA: Case 1: Anup Burman came out of the Bank of India on CIT Road with Rs 10,000 in a bag.

Three persons standing nearby told him that there was dirt on the back of his shirt. They took him to a tea stall to wash it off.

While Burman was busy cleaning, they disappeared with his bag.

Case 2: At Burrabazar, two persons accosted a trader and pointed at the filth on his back. They took him to a tap, not knowing that they had spattered his shirt with a paste made of biscuit and banana. Just as he was trying to wash his shirt, the miscreants tried to escape with his bag.

Such instances of kepmari are not uncommon. When you are on a Puja shopping spree donâ€™t throw caution to the wind. According to the detective department of the Kolkata Police, New Market, Gariahat, Maidan Market and the approach roads are favourite haunts of kepmars. The vulnerable zones include Hare Street, Jorasanko, Posta, Burrabazar, Ultadanga, Tollygunge, Bhowanipore and Gariahat police station areas.

According to DC DD (I) Soumen Mitra, before the pujas, kepmars come from Andhra Pradesh, Orissa and parts of Madhya Pradesh. They usually operate in groups of at least three in malls, fairs and near banks. They choose places close to a water source.

According to OC (watch section) S. Badrudduja, â€œThey are never violent. We have never found any weapons in possession of kepmars.â€�

The success of kepmars depend on how well they can distract the victim. Some spit biscuit-banana paste, some sprinkle a mixture of talcum powder and crushed seeds of alkushi or bichuti which cause severe itching, said Badrudduja. Sometimes, boys of 13 or 14 or very old men, are part of the gang. Halishahar in North 24 Parganas is believed to have the highest number of kepmars. They usually live in groups at places like Bandel and Naihati. They have their code language. For instance, police is called Nai (which is Tamil for dog), when filth is to be thrown on the victim, a member calls out Ra Pari Giri, Orippo means fly away or escape and LP is police from Lalbazar.

According to DD sleuths, kepmars never turn sources. If a member X is arrested, the rest of the gang would look after his family as long as he is not released. But, if following his confession, any other gang member is arrested, then X has to pay heavily. X has to bear the entire amount spent in fighting cases and related expenses.

Keeping track of kepmars is difficult as they keeping shifting their place of operation. After a couple of operations here, they move to Mumbai or Delhi and may resurface after about six months. According to Mitra, plainclothes men have been deployed at shopping malls and busy thoroughfares to keep an eye on kepmars.

â€œThey can to spot a kepmar by watching his movement, â€� he said. presentation was made recently CAG audit. With regard to the JPC, ministryâ€�.
