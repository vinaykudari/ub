0,"Church authorities, devotees protest against ASI","CHANDIGARH: The morning prayer at Christ Church CNI, Sector-18, turned into fracas when the assistant sub inspector from Sector 19 police station entered the church and asked the authorities there to reduce the volume of the loud speaker.

The church authorities and the devotees alleged that ASI Karam Singh used derogatory language and threatened that he would take away the speaker.

Protesting against the ASI''s improper'' behaviour, over 250 residents took out a rally towards the deputy commissioner''s residence, which was stopped at near the Sector 7-8 dividing road.

About five representatives then handed over a copy of the memorandum to DC Arun Kumar, who pacified the protestors and asked the authorities to keep the loudspeaker''s volume low.

1,Madrassas to be wooed to accept govt's control,"HYDERABAD: The National Minorities Development and Finance Corporation (NMDFC) has planned a meeting with the managements of major madrassas in Andhra Pradesh to convince them to agree for the establishment of a statecontrolled Madrassa Board.

NMFDC chairperson Mohammed Miyan Mazhari, who visited the city to review the progress of Dukan-Makan scheme, told reporters there was a good budget for educational empowerment of Muslims and madrassa modernisation was one of the key programmes under the schemes being sponsored by the Ministry of Human Resource Development and the Moulana Azad Educational Foundation.

A major chunk of this budget is allocated to provide computer education to madrassa students, he added.

The only thing the madrassas had to do was that they must register themselves with the statecontrolled Madrassa Board, Mazhari said, adding that such boards had been set up in several states and madrassas there were getting good funds from the government.

He said the board was not set up in Andhra Pradesh because there was resistance from some madrassas which believed that the formation of board would lead to the government''s interference in the traditional education system.

The corporation chairman clarified that there was no hidden agenda behind the establishment of a board.

A meeting with madrassa managements will be held after Ramazan to clarify their doubts and take them into confidence to set up the board, he said adding madrassas should realise that they would be benefited a lot if they got a government-controlled board.

Mazhari said madrassas in Karnataka were convinced about the establishment of a board, which would take shape soon.

2,Thousands of VHP workers arrested,"LUCKNOW: Even as thousands of Ayodhya-bound VHP activists were arrested on Sunday, the VHP renewed its resolve to go ahead with the October 17 programme in Ayodhya saying that a showdown of ''might and valour'' is imminent now after the Mulayam Singh Yadav government''s repressive measures.

During checking at railways stations and bus stands on Sunday, the police arrested 1067 VHP activists in Jhansi and over 2000 in other places, including Bahraich, Allahabad, Varanasi, Kanpur.

VHP state organising secretary Pushottam Narain Singh, however, put the arrest figure at over 10,000, claiming that 5,000 Ram bhakts coming from Gujarat and the south, were arrested in Jhansi alone. Over 1000 each were arrested in Allahabad, Kanpur, Varanasi and Ayodhya.

The state administration on Sunday stepped up security measures, sealing the borders of Faizabad, and diverting heavy vehicles. Faizabad would be cut off from the rest of the country from Sunday night.

With the arrest of 35 Nepalese members of the VHP in Bahraich on Sunday, directives have been issued to intensify patrolling on the UP-Nepal and UP-Bihar borders too.

That the Mulayam government has taken the VHP threat seriously could be gauged from the fact that several companies of RPF, CRPF and PAC have been deployed in the Red, Yellow and Blue zones of the ''security ring'' in Ayodhya.

In addition to 31 companies of the CRPF already reaching Ayodhya, 12 more companies were pulled out from trouble-torn Jammu and Kashmir. The CRPF personnel disembarked in Lucknow on Sunday and moved on to Ayodhya in awaiting trucks and buses to take positions.

Unfazed by the security steps, the VHP, however, reiterated its resolve to hold the October 17 programme come what may. ""Mulayam Singh is creating a 1990 like situation. But he seems to have forgotten that despite bullets, kar sevaks had reached Ayodhya in large numbers and had successfully performed kar seva,"" warned the VHP state organising secretary.

""If Mulayam is out to take repressive measures then a showdown is inevitable. Saryu would turn red again if we are stopped from holding our religious congregation,"" he added.

As a precautionary measure, senior VHP leaders would go underground from Sunday night to safely resurface in Ayodhya on or before October 17. VHP working president Ashok Singhal cancelled his programmes in UP and rushed to Delhi from Kanpur. Senior VHP leaders are meeting in Delhi to chalk out their final strategy for the success of the Ayodhya programme.

Meanwhile, the BJP has also come out in the open to support the VHP programme. State party chief Vinay Katiyar said that BJP workers would wear saffron and participate in large numbers in the Ram Sankalp Yatra. Katiyar himself would lead party workers to Ayodhya to attend the VHP programme.

3,"CM’s clean chit to MLAs, ministers","PATNA: Chief minister Rabri Devi made a U-turn on Sunday after airing her grievances against her ministers and RJD MLAs on Saturday at the concluding session of the party''s national meet.

In a government Press release issued on Sunday, the chief minister claimed that she had never expressed doubts about the integrity and honesty of her ministers and MLAs. She alleged that her statement had been distorted by the media.

The chief minister said in the release that every minister in her government and legislators were fulfilling their responsibilities honestly. Reacting to media reports, she said that she had never said that her ministers were corrupt and making money. ""I have full faith in the honesty, loyalty and capability of my ministers and legislators,"" she said.

She claimed that her ministers and MLAs were committed to uplift of the poor and downtrodden sections of the society. She appealed to her partymen not to be ""swayed"" by misleading reports and continue to extend their strong support to the party and her government.

Incidentally, in the RJD national meet, immediately after Rabri''s speech Laloo had gone on the defensive and strongly supported party MLAs and ministers. He had described Rabri''s outburst as an ""emotional response"".

However, Rabri''s remarks appear to have been resented by party ministers and MLAs although none of them wants to go on record. ""The CM should ask her brothers how they are purchasing one vehicle after another,"" remarked an angry RJD minister.

Meanwhile, BJP workers took out a rally and burnt the effigy of Rabri Devi government on Sunday. Party''s chief whip in the state assembly, Navin Kishore Prasad Sinha, said that the chief minister herself had conceded that her ministers were corrupt.

He demanded the resignation of Rabri ministry, stressing that it had lost its moral authority to continue in power.

4,14 arrested for Purulia ambush,"BANDOWAN (Purulia): Saturday''s ambush of a police patrol â€” the second attack by MCC rebels in Bengal and the biggest so far â€” was planned to free the ""Naxalite corridor"" that sweeps through dense forests in Andhra Pradesh, Orissa, Jharkhand, Bihar, West Bengal to Nepal.

On Sunday, IG (west zone) Goutam Mohan Chakraborty personally led raids in several villages along with DIG (Midnapore range) Sadhan Mondal, Purulia SP Vineet Goel and RAF and EFR jawans.

Fourteen people have been arrested, including an alleged â€˜kingpin'' Kalipada Murmu, from Gulpana. The IG feels the ambush was the handiwork of local MCC cadres.

The police are planning a massive crackdown on Naxalites. The SP of Jharkhand''s East Singbhum arrived with his men in Purulia on Sunday to join forces with the Bengal cops.

A high-level meeting between the two police forces will take place on Monday to jointly combat the challenge thrown by MCC and PW. A new police outpost has been set up to track Naxalite movement.

The police are sure that the ambush was planned long ago, and was carried out with ruthless precision to thwart the police movement in dense tribal hamlets, which provide easy shelter to Naxalites.

Gamchas and waterbottles litter the ambush site, indicating that the ultras had waited for a long time.

The sound of the blast carried six km. It is now learnt that OC Nilmadhab Das jumped out with his revolver immediately after the blast and was shot in the chest.

The police had SLRs to match the extremists'' firepower but couldn''t see anything in the smoke.

Purulia DSP Krisnakali Das, who narrowly escaped the blast, led a counterattack but the ultras used the smokescreen to escape.

Local leaders admit that the state''s neglect of the region has helped Naxalites strike roots here.

""The MCC ultras gave them food and clothes and slowly gained their confidence,"" says Bhaluk Das of Kumra gram panchayat.

5,Ready for rally with eye on court,"KOLKATA: The battle lines are drawn and the defiance made loud and clear, leaving little scope for police to let the hide-and-seek game go on.

Either they prevent the ruling CPM''s student-youth rally on Monday and the Citu rally on Tuesday or trample the court order.

And this time, the entire administration runs the risk of defying the judiciary, says senior counsel Jayanta Mitra.

Sensing the gravity of the situation, the state is moving the high court vacation Bench for a stay on Justice Amitava Lala''s interim order.

""We are aware of the rights of political parties to hold rallies and meetings and see to it that people do not suffer. I hope that the state would get justice tomorrow (Monday),"" said chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.

The CPM state secretariat discussed with advocate-general Balai Roy at Alimuddin Street on Friday the legal ramifications of the court order. Roy is learnt to have advised the party mandarins to take up the matter with the vacation Bench at the earliest.

But the administration can''t sit idle and wait for the stay. As things stand, the interim order is alive and the rallies, too, are on.

The two programmes leave little room for interpretation. They are quite apart from the People''s Relief Committee rally last weekend, when Left Front chairman Biman Bose took to the streets taking advantage of the confusion on whether Saturday was a weekday.

State CPM mouthpiece Ganashakti has been carrying insertions on the two rallies for the past three days, asking supporters to join with festoons and placards.

All this, after state chief secretary S.N. Roy received a copy of the order on Friday. He should have passed it on to DC (traffic) M.K. Singh, the contemner.

""This is a judicial order and binding on the state, irrespective of the language,"" said a former Chief Justice of Calcutta High Court.

He rubbished the ""naive approach"" of taking liberty with Justice Lala''s directive as ""guidelines suggested on experimental basis"".

The former CJ quipped, ""People who have even a smattering of court directives, rulings or verdict, would not say so.""

The police also can''t choose to overlook the DYFI-SFI rally as they had done with the CPI(ML) rally a few days ago.

Organisers maintain that at least 10,000 youths would march on Monday through College Street, Bowbazar, Central Avenue and Esplanade in the afternoon. It is anybody''s guess how long they would hold the city to ransom.

6,10 arrested for Kamsar Army camp attack,"JAMMU: In a major breakthrough, the police on Sunday arrested 10 people involved in the September 4 suicide attack on the Kamsar Army camp in Jammu and Kashmir''s Poonch district.

The attack had left three dead and nine injured, bursting a Lashkar-e-Toiba module. Working on the leads, a police team led by DSP (headquarters) Nasi Ahmed arrested two overground workers of the module, which had helped the two-member LeT suicide squad to carry out the attack on the Army camp, SSP Mukesh Singh said here.

7,"Valley figures belie govt, Army claims","NEW DELHI: Contrary to assertions by the government and the Army, the pattern of violence in the Kashmir Valley has not shown any marked change. The figures indicate that Pakistan has retained its capacity to inflict violence, regardless of what India does.

In 2002, India threatened to attack Pakistan and massed its entire Army on the border. Large tracts of the entire Indo- Pakistan border were mined. Yet, infiltration was at an all- time high as shown by the fact that some 120 were killed in the process. This was the year when the Pakistani president Pervez Musharraf made a commitment to President Bush that he would end infiltration permanently. l In the same year, India held a credible election in the state that brought to power a representative government and overthrew the National Conference monolith that had dominated the states politics for decades.

The inference is that something is wrong with Indiaâ€™s Kashmir handling, be it military, diplomatic or political. Confronted with the statistics, the ministry of home affairs is likely to blame chief minister Mufti Mohammed Sayeedâ€™s â€˜â€˜healing touchâ€™â€™ policy. The failure is primarily on the diplomatic and military fronts. The PM summarised this in his address to the UN when he said there would be no dialogue with Pakistan till it ended cross-border terrorism, or till India managed to eradicate it on its own.

There are no signs that Pakistan intends to end cross-border terrorism, with or without US pressure. So what about eradicating it on our own? Despite tall talk, we are nowhere near achieving the goal. The problem lies in Indiaâ€™s fortress mentality. In history, there are only rare instances of forts holding out against a determined enemy. To change the strategy, India needs new instruments. But despite evidence that a new kind of Army organisation is needed, the Indian Army leadership remains lethargically committed to its World War II mentality.

Since Pakistan has nuclear weapons, an all-out frontal attack is a non-option. Army planners have mooted a tactic to have forward echelons cling to enemy forces even as they advance into Pakistan. But the utility of this tactic, first mooted and never tested, by NATO to deal with Warsaw Pact, is questionable. What the armed forces need are a number of Special Forces divisions that can strike swiftly and leave the scene before the adversary can get his act together. Such forces have to combine sea, air and land elements as well as precise surveillance capabilities. No extra money is required as their budgets could be obtained by compelling the Army and the IAF to shed flab.

8,"Religion and politics do not mix, debate is alive","NEW DELHI: The BJPâ€™s resolve to construct a temple of Lord Ram at the site of the demolished Babri mosque in Ayodhya could again revive the debate over whether religion should be mixed with politics. The BJP was ruling in four states when the disputed Babri mosque structure was demolished by kar sevaks on December 6,1992.

The then UP chief minister Kalyan Singh had given an undertaking to the National Integration Council that the twin structure would be protected at all cost. This assurance was reiterated before the Supreme Court but the state government failed to honour it. Kalyan Singh resigned soon after the then UP counsel K K Venugopal told the judges at a special sitting on the night of December 6 that â€˜â€˜my head hangs in shameâ€™â€™.

However, the dismissed BJP governments in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh challenged the Presidentâ€™s rule under Article 356 of the Constitution. They contended that the party was voted to power because it had declared in its manifesto that a Ram temple would be constructed in Ayodhya. In the famous S R Bommai case judgment relating to imposition of the Presidentâ€™s rule in a state where governance was not possible in accordance with the Constitution, a Bench of nine judges said â€˜â€˜secularism is the basic feature of the Constitutionâ€™â€™.

That was one of the reasons that Presidentâ€™s rule was upheld in the three states. â€˜â€˜ While freedom of religion is guaranteed to all persons in India, from the point of view of the State, the religion, faith or belief of a person is immaterialâ€™â€™, the court said while laying guidelines for invoking Article 356.

The court, which had looked into the White Paper on Ayodhya, the BJP manifesto and the arguments made in favour or against the dismissal of the BJP governments, said: â€˜â€˜No political party can simultaneously be a religious party.â€™â€™ â€˜â€˜Politics and religion cannot be mixed. Any government which pursues unsecular policies or acts contrary to the constitutional mandate renders itself amenable to action under Article 356.â€™â€™ This assumes significance as it carries a warning to certain political parties known for carrying on their religious agenda through governance.

9,Agra tense after mob targets minister,"AGRA: Police fired in the air to disperse a mob of angry BSP supporters who attempted to attack former partyman and Uttar Pradesh Minister of State for Science and Technology Chaudhri Bashir.

Police said cases of rioting had been instituted against four people and an unspecified number of arrests made in Mantola and Rakabganj thana areas.

BSP workers and Samajwadi Party supporters of Bashir clashed in the communally sensitive area of Mantola on Sunday evening.

Sporadic incidents of pelting and firing were still being reported, police said.

The mob broke into the house of Bashir''s friend where the minister was visiting but he escaped to the third storey of the building, until police arrived and fired in the air to disperse the mob.

Bashir''s supporters clashed with the BSP volunteers and even resorted firing despite the police presence.

It was only after midnight that the situation was brought under control and the minister was taken to a police station for protection, police said.

10,Cong high command to decide fate of DF govt,"PUNE: Even as relations between the Congress and Nationalist Congress Party continued to be strained over the issue of Sonia Gandhiâ€™s leadership, chief minister Sushilkumar Shinde on Monday categorically stated that the Congress high command will decide the fate of the democratic front government in the state.

""It was the party high command that told us to join the DF govern-ment so the decision regarding whether the Congress would remain in the government or not will be taken only by the high command,"" Shinde clarified while speaking to reporters after a meeting to re-view the scarcity situation in Pune division.

Answering a question as to when the decision was expected from the top brass, Shinde stated that it may take seven days, twelve days or even more.

""It is not our place to decide the time limit for taking any decision,"" he clarified. His remark assumes importance on the backdrop of the seven day deadline given by Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee chief Ranjit Deshmukh to NCP to decide on the leadership issue.

In response NCP president Sharad Pawar yesterday hit the ball back in the Congress court saying that NCP will not budge on the leadership issue and it was upto the Congress to decide whether they wanted to remain in the DF government.

However Shinde made his displeasure very clear over NCP presi-dent Sharad Pawarâ€™s remarks about Sonia Gandhiâ€™s leadership. ""She is our leader so how do you expect us to keep quiet if someone attacks her?,"" he asked. He said that both Congress and NCP were working together as constituents of the DF government.

""Deputy chief minister Chhagan Bhujbal had stated that NCP was joining hands with us because both wanted to ensure that secular forces came to power in the state. He called us elder brother,"" Shinde re-minded.

He pointed out that the Congress was making many sacrifices to keep out the fundamentalist forces and stated that even the NCP should exercise some restrain. ""We have made our displeasure known about NCP questioning Sonia Gandhiâ€™s leadership on ground that she was of foreign origin,"" Shinde stated.

The chief minister clarified that the Congress will not tolerate any attack on Sonia Gandhi just to remain in power. ""We will not want to remain in the government at the cost of our leader,"" he observed. However if the NCP was so rigid on the foreigner issue we will have to rethink out stand, Shinde stated.

Meanwhile, speaking on the scarcity situation in Pune division Shinde said that the situation was very serious in Solapur and San-gli. Around 3.45 lakh cattle were kept in 398 cattle sheds and 935 tankers have been pressed into service to supply drinking water to 924 villages and 2630 colonies.

Shinde said that the government has issued instructions not to transfer any agricultural division out of the scarcity hit areas. Over 3000 vacancies of agricultural assistants and supervisors will be filled immediately. Even people who have retired from the agri de-partment will be taken on job for the time being, he said. Students from 69 talukas in 10 districts will be given fee exemption.

The chief minister said that the state has asked for Rs 1373 crore from the union government to tackle the scarcity situation. ""We expect to receive Rs 48 crore shortly,"" he said.

The government has also asked for five lakh tonne foodgrains which will be distributed among people living in scarcity affected areas.

Speaking about the artificial rain experiment, Shinde said that con-sidering the success of the experiment, the state government has decided to buy an aeroplane of its own and put up a radar so that the experiment can be repeated in drought prone areas of the state in the future.

11,Rifle recovered from Maya farmhouse,"NEW DELHI: CBI has claimed to have recovered an automatic rifle from the farmhouse of former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Mayawati at Bulandsher and has informed the district administration for action to be taken.

The disclosure was made by the CBI in its detailed report to the designated court at Lucknow on Monday on the searches conducted at 21 places in the controversial Taj Heritage Corridor project.

CBI alleged that during its raids on premises belonging to Mayawati and her close relatives, it had found an automatic rifle at the farmhouse in Bulandsher which is owned by the former chief minister.

On enquiry, it was found that the weapon was licenced and was in the name of Mayawati''s brother, Raj Kumar and should not have been kept there, CBI sources said.

The sources said the district administration had been informed about the same for necessary action which might include registration of an Arms Act case against the owner of the farmhouse besides cancellation of the licence.

The report submitted to the designated court gave details about the seizure which included recovery of Rs five lakh from Mayawati''s Delhi residence.

The CBI had taken search warrants from the court after registering a case against Mayawati and others on October five.

CBI raided Mayawati''s residences in Delhi and Lucknow, besides 19 other places in connection with the controversial Rs 175 crore Taj Heritage Corridor project. The CBI registered two FIRs at a designated court in Lucknow on Sunday.

In the first FIR, CBI has named Mayawati, Naseemuddin, former Chief Seceratry D S Bagga, former Environment Secretaries R K Sharma and V K Gupta, Under Secretary Rajendra Prasad, former Union Environment Secretary K C Mishra, NPCC Chairman Bali and Delhi-based companies Ishwaku and CAPS.

They have been accused of allegedly abusing their official position, besides being slapped with charges under Sections 120-B (criminal conspiracy), 420 (cheating), 467, 468 and 471 (all related to forgery).

The CBI also filed a second FIR against Mayawati for allegedly owning assets disproportionate to her known sources of income.

12,NCP rules out threat to Maharashtra govt,"MUMBAI: The on-going verbal spat between Congress and NCP, the main partners in the ruling coalition in Maharashtra, appeared to have been resolved Monday with the Sharad Pawar-led outfit ruling out any threat to the government over the issue of foreign origin of AICC president Sonia Gandhi.

""There is no acrimony among Congress and NCP on the issue of foreign origin of Sonia and there is no threat to the government"", Deputy Chief Minister Chhagan Bhujbal told reporters here.

Bhujbal''s statement comes in the wake of MPCC Chief Ranjit Deshmukh clarifying that he had not issued any ultimatum to NCP President Sharad Pawar and had not talked about snapping ties with the coalition partner over the foreign origin issue of Sonia.

Bhujbal maintained that both Congress and NCP should work closely to keep away ""communal forces"" like Shiv Sena and BJP at bay.

""Both Congress and NCP are independent political parties and during election campaign criticism is bound to happen. But we have to take all such things in right spirit"", the Deputy Chief Minister added.

NCP spokesman Praful Patel described MPCC Chief Ranjit Deshmukh''s climbdown as a ""welcome statement"". ""The clarification (by Deshmukh) augurs well for the ruling coalition"", Patel said adding that it would work well for the government.

Patel said ""we are in the government for the last four years and we are confident that with the latest development, we will complete the remaining term"".

Patel, however, ruled out any change in the party''s stand over foreign origin issue. ""The party was formed over this issue, how can we abandon it?"", he asked.

He expressed surprise over Congress'' ultimatum saying whatever Pawar had stated at the public rally in New Delhi was in keeping with the party''s stance.

The NCP spokesman said both the parties, as independent bodies, reserved the right to criticise each other.

On the allegation that Pawar was not co-operating with Congress at the national level, Patel said ""we supported the Congress-sponsored no-confidence motion in Lok Sabha"".

Similarly, Pawar himself had attended two meetings at the residence of Sonia to fine-tune strategy of the opposition at the national level, he recalled.

Asked whether his party was willing to have a tie-up with the Congress, Patel said ""if they (Congress) are willing to accept the alliance knowing well our agenda, we are prepared for it"".

But said modalities for the alliance would have to be worked out afresh. The formula of 1999, the year NCP came into being, could not be applied now as the party has grown over the years in Maharashtra, Patel added.

To a query on whether the party would be favouring separate Lok Sabha and Assembly polls in Maharashtra, Patel said it was too premature to talk about it at this juncture.

14,Shekhawat 'interest' in polls upsets Cong,"NEW DELHI: The ''interest'' being shown by long-time Rajasthan chief minister and now the country''s vice-president, Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, in the coming elections to the state assembly has upset Congressmen.

Shekhawat, they say, has made the BJP fightback a prestige issue. The vice-president''s office denies any undue role.

But, in political terms, Congressmen are not complaining. The importance being given to his son-in-law, Narpat Singh Rajvi, has alienated other party stalwarts like Hari Shankar Bhabhra, Lokendra Singh Kalvi and Devi Singh Bhati. ''''A divided BJP should make our task easier, provided we work unitedly,'''' says an office-bearer.

This charade is in time for Congress chief Sonia Gandhi, who will begin campaigning here on Thursday. Apart from the incumbency factor, drought relief is another issue. Rajasthan Congress''s poll manifesto points out that although the Centre had been niggardly with relief, the Gehlot government organised schemes which was appreciated even by Prime Minister A B Vajpayee.

Bhartiâ€™s candidature in the elections is not even being discussed.

Following talks of an alliance between the Congress and the BSP, the BJP is reworking its ticket distribution strategy in MP. The caste factor will be vital for ticket distribution, especially in districts bordering UP, where BSPâ€™s clout has been growing.
