0,Deranged youth arrested for murder,"PUNE: The Nigdi police on Tuesday arrested a mentally deranged youth accused of murdering a teenager in Nigdi on Saturday.

It may be recalled that, 15-year-old Sonali Bhandare, resident of Ota Scheme, who worked as a maid servant in Pradhikaran was stabbed in the stomach by a youth riding a M-80 moped. Sonali later succumbed to her injuries.

Addressing a press conference on Tuesday, commissioner of police Ranjit Singh Sharma said that, ""after Sonali''s death, around 15 women from the area came forward and told us that they had similar experiences. Some of them had been pricked with keys while others had been pricked with some sharp weapon but they had not reported the incidents for fear of negative publicity"".

He further said, ""One of the women targeted by the accused, Babasaheb Sabale (25), resident of Wakad, had noted down the number of his vehicle, which she handed over to the police. It was through this lead that the police traced the registration of the vehicle and found out the name and address of the accused. The police then went to the address given by RTO authorities but Sabale had moved to some other area"".

The Nigdi police then searched the voters list of the Pimpri-Chinchwad area and found Sabale''s new address and arrested him.

Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP-Zone III) Naval Bajaj who was also present at the press conference said, ""after we arrested Sabale, we consulted some psychiatrists who spoke with Sable and concluded that he is the victim of the Impulse Control Disorder"".

Bajaj added, ""During the interrogation, Sable told us that as he was getting into regular arguments with his wife, he had started hating women and had started hurting them with keys or the hacksaw blade for the past six months"".

Explaining Sabale''s method, Bajaj said, ""all the attacks took place on his route to work and whenever he spotted lonely women, he used to prick them either with a key or hacksaw blade. However, he never intended to kill them"".

Replying to a question Bajaj said, ""Sonali died because she had been injured on some vital artery or vein. She was lying on the road for 45 minutes before she was rushed to the hospital and she was very thin"".

1,Coercive measures run counter to population policy,"NEW DELHI: In their eagerness to control the countryâ€™s growing numbers, several states are preparing to use coercive population control methods in complete violation of the national policy.

""People who are at the helm of affairs are in too much of a hurry and want to show early results,"" say experts, who are worried about the negative impact of such an approach. Not only will it be a violation of human rights but may also increase female foeticide, they say.

At least five states â€” Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra â€” have already prepared policies that propose various disincentives, which include denial of free rations and education to the third child.

Andhra Pradesh, for instance, is considering limiting educational concession for the first two children only. Maharashtra has proposed denial of food rations and free education to the third child and Madhya Pradesh proposes to penalise those adults who were married early. Rajasthan, while urging government employees to encourage the two-child norm, has decided to give them ""certificates of excellence"" for ""outstanding achievements"".

While earlier attempts of state governments were limited to checking the family size of legislators, the new measures target panchayats and people right down to the village. ""Even the rights of the third child are not being recognised,"" says public health specialist Imraana Qadeer.

Experts, who disagree with this approach, say policy needs to address womenâ€™s need for better health. The target-centric approach that the government had adopted earlier not only failed miserably but also worked to the detriment of other basic health services. Demographer Ashish Bose says the emphasis on numbers will be counter-productive to any population policy. ""Politically as well, it will boomerang,"" he adds.

The issues, which really influence population growth rates, such as womenâ€™s education, work participation, son preference, need to be targeted so as to change social norms, instead of fixing demographic targets, which do not work.

Documents with the Planning Commission show how coercive methods do not work, says Qadeer. It is also known that the government has not been able to provide sufficient services. Not only does the approach contradict the national population policy but also the programme of action adopted at the international population conference in Cairo, which stated that informed individuals can act responsibly in the light of their own needs.

2,Role of NGOs in panchayat polls debated,"HAZARIBAG: A workshop on the role of NGOs in Jharkhand panchayat elections and information dissemination was organised by Nav Bharat Jagriti Kendra at its coordination office here on Saturday.

The inaugural speech was given by Girija Satish, executive director, Nav Bharat Jagriti Kendra, who, after the welcome speech elaborated on the objectives of the workshop.

Praising the organisers for the workshop, he stated that these workshops also play a vital role in motivating the representatives of the people and hoped that the next panchayat elections in Jharkhand would take place in the coming months of September-October.

5,Single municipal law proposed,"HYDERABAD: The state government will shortly bring a comprehensive act to replace the A P Municipal Corporations Act and Hyderabad Municipal Corporation Act, 1955, for better administration of civic bodies.

Following the recommendations of several IAS officers at the recently held meeting at the Institute of Administration, the government has decided to replace the acts with a uniform law. Accordingly, a group of officers have been appointed to study and update their provisions.

According to a senior Municipal Corporation of Hyderabad (MCH) official, the procedures in the HMC act are cumbersome and there was confusion over several issues such as powers and role of elected representatives and officials. Relating the convoluted nature of the HMC actâ€™s provisions, the official said: â€œA resolution passed by the Standing Committee and later by the council has to be placed again at the next council meeting for confirmation. It is taking a lot of time.

Once the resolution is passed, it should be final.â€� According to the MCH (Regulation of the proceedings and conduct of business of the Corporation and the Standing Committee) bylaws, 1966, after the resolution is passed, it has to be placed again at the next meeting for confirmation.

â€œEvery time, the minutes of the last meeting has to be confirmed as per the existing rules,â€� an official said. Andhra Pradesh is the only state that has two acts for civic bodies, while a single act is in force in other states. Besides recommendations from officials, the elected representatives have demanded amendments to the HMC Act. After the elections to the Municipal Corporation of Hyderabad were held, there was also a debate over powers of the mayor, deputy mayor and corporators.

But the HMC Act is silent with regard to delegation of powers and role of elected representatives and officials. Consequently, officers and corporators have been accusing each other of trying to â€˜dominateâ€™ by taking advantage of the HMC Act.

6,"Police, CPM clash at village meeting","VIJAYAWADA: As many as 13 activists of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), including the party Vijayawada secretary Ch Babu Rao, were seriously injured in a brutal lathi charge by the police at Payakapuram in Vijayawada on Tuesday during the Janmabhoomi programme.

The police lathi charge was on people protesting hike in water tariff. Babu Rao was later arrested along with CPM city committee members Donepudi Kasinath, Vishnuvardhan and Sambi Reddy.

No charges were, however, framed against them till late in the evening. Police alleged that the CPM women activists hurled stones at the Armed Reserve Police vehicle and tried to deflate the tyres when the police sought to escort the Janmabhoomi nodal officer Rajagopala Naidu to safety.

7,Police chase lawyers,"VIJAYAWADA: The city police made a mockery of themselves on Tuesday in attempting to arrest a lawyer.

There was high drama both inside and outside the civil courts complex in the city on Tuesday afternoon as a large contingent of police descended on the scene to arrest a lawyer for allegedly assaulting a police head constable attached to the armed reserve. The police party waited anxiously for the lawyer to come out of the Bezawada Bar Association Hall so that he could be arrested without any fuss.

But that did not happen. In the meanwhile, BBA secretary Jayakar and three other lawyers got into a car and tried to leave the court premises. Suspecting that the wanted lawyer could be in the car, the police gave a chase in true filmy style. The Krishna Lanka sub-inspector of police A Pallapu Raju dragged down a scooterist, seized the vehicle and gave a hot chase even as his colleagues followed suit in four jeeps.

The chase ended at Veedhiraju Meda centre near Kothavantena on the Karl Marx Road when the police could successfully stop the car. However, to their utter dismay, they found that the wanted lawyer was not in the vehicle. The police could not realise that it was a clever ploy by the lawyers to divert the police attention and save their colleague.

The lawyers plan worked out well as the police were grossly foxed by the Bar Association secretary. Seizing the opportunity, the BBA members surrendered the P Saibabu before the fifth metropolitan magistrate.

8,"PWG, govt work out details for talks","HYDERABAD: Emissaries of Peoples War Group, the most militant of the CPI-ML groups, would sit for the first time with the Andhra Pradesh government to work out the finer details for actual round of talks to be held later.

While the extremist outfit fielded singer Gadar and writer Varavara Rao, both sympathisers of the movement, the state has opted for former CBI director K Vijayarama Rao and T Sitaram (both ministers) to negotiate with the PWG nominees.

The legislation of Pota, which threatens to break PWG''s carefully nurtured structure of sympathisers, drummer boys and many vociferous forums besides growing surrenders, defections increased vigilance and cynicism among a section that ""time is not ripe for our line of revolution in such a large democracy like India"" may be some of the reasons which weighed in favour of talks for the PWG, observers feel.

On the government side, PWG''s recent change in strategy which aimed at attacking economic roots and blasting factories of politicians, besides the perceived threat restricting the movement of elected representatives and police, loss of leader from all political parties and the resolve to usher in peace were the main factors guiding the state to agree for talks with the dreaded extremist outfit.

The two decade long conflict has claimed about 5,000 lives besides damage to property worth crores.

9,New power tariff policy in 3 months: Prabhu,"NEW DELHI: Close on the heels of initiating reforms in the distribution sector, the government on Wednesday announced that a new power tariff policy would be put in place in the next three months.

""The draft policy is ready after consulting all stake holders, especially the states. We have sent the policy for comments to an independent organisation,"" Power Minister Suresh Prabhu said on the sidelines of a power seminar organised by Independent Power Producers Association (IPPAI).

Prabhu, however, refused to name the independent research organisation which would be reviewing the draft policy.

This has been done to ensure that interests of all stakeholders were taken into consideration.

Based on this policy, all the power regulators in the states would be fixing the tariffs, the minister said, adding in the absence of a broad policy, there would be multiple tariffs in various states.

Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) had earlier announced new availability-based tariff norms, which have been implemented by various power generation companies and states.

10,No talks without Pak inclusion: Hurriyat,"SRINAGAR: Toeing a Pakistani line, separatist conglomerate, Hurriyat Conference, on Wednesday claimed that no infiltration was taking place across the Line of Control and maintained that it would not enter into a dialogue with India till New Delhi agreed to include Islamabad in the parleys.

""We outrightly reject the charge of cross-border terrorism or infiltration. There is absolutely no infiltration or cross-border terrorism and the ongoing freedom struggle in Kashmir is indigenous in form and content,"" Hurriyat Chairman Abdul Gani Bhat told reporters here.

""No border exists in Kashmir. It is Line of Control that divides two parts of Kashmir. Why should the question of cross-border terrorism come up,"" Bhat said at a hurriedly called press conference.

The statement comes in the wake of international pressure on Pakistan to stop cross-border terrorism and infiltration into Jammu and Kashmir.

In the backdrop of a statement by British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw refusing to term the violence as a ""freedom struggle"", the Hurriyat Conference Chairman said international community should draw a line between freedom struggle and terrorism.

11,HC raises five-fold compensation to 1984 riot victims,"MUMBAI: The Mumbai High Court on Wednesday, enhanced from Rs 5000 to Rs 25,000 the compensation awarded to the relatives of victims of the 1984 communal riots that occurred in Maharashtra in the aftermath of Indira Gandhi''s assassination ordering the authorities to settle the claims within eight weeks.

The judgement was delivered by Chief Justice C K Thakker and Justice Ranjana Desai on a public interest litigation filed by Rajya Sabha MP S S Ahluwalia, who urged for Rs two lakh compensation to each of the riot victim''s family.

The judges ordered district collectors of Ahmednagar, Jalgaon and Akola to invite claims from the kins of the victims through advertisements in newspapers and settle them within two months.

In Maharashtra the riots had occurred in Kopargaon, Bhusawal and Akola in which nine persons, including three Sikhs, were killed.

Ahluwalia had initially filed a PIL in Delhi High Court urging for high compensation to families of victims all over the country. He had cited the Ranganath Mishra Commission report which indicted police for its hand in the riots.

Accordingly, the Delhi High Court awarded Rs two lakh compensation to victims, who were killed in the national capital on the basis of the commission report.

As regards victims in other places, the high court was of the view that the circumstances prevailing therein could be different and referred the PIL to the high courts of various states where the riots had occurred.

In Mumbai High Court, Advocate General Goolam Vahanvati opposed the PIL on the ground that in Maharashtra there were no allegations against police and hence the compensation to the victims was adequate.

Balkrishna Joshi, counsel for petitioner, however, argued that even in Maharashtra the compensation was not adequate.

He urged the court to fix a minimum amount of compensation and direct the collectors to invite claims.

13,Security ordeal delays shipment at Kandla,"AHMEDABAD: Security is tighter than ever before - with a watchful eye being kept on every consignment that arrives - at Kandla port. Containers used to ferry sugar, rice, timber or even wheat are being scanned for weapons and explosives, so much so that the meticulous task is causing long delays in offloading material.

Security has been stepped up several grades in the wake of Pakistan navy chief''s statement last week that Pakistan could target Kandla with missiles if India blockades Karachi port. In fact, importers are complaining about the inconvenience caused by the exercise. Ships moving in from Karachi and other West Asian destinations are also being rummaged with engine rooms and all other corners being screened at this busy port in the Gulf of Kutch that caters to north India, too.

While sources at the Kandla Port Trust said that anti-aircraft are being moved into the premises from the nearest base, authorities have begun thorough checking and screening of goods arriving in containers from foreign ports. Each container, hitherto let off on the basis of tranship documents, is being opened and scanned. Even BSF sniffer dogs are being put on the job to detect explosives.

According to a Gandhidham-based cargo handling agent, ""the extreme security arrangements could mean losing money and making the port unviable for importers."" He said ""each container is opened and checked thoroughly by the Customs, port authorities and the Central Industrial Security Force, before being released out of the premises"".

Customs commissioner at Kandla RM Ramchandani, however, said people will have to sacrifice a bit for national security. ""We are trying to get things cleared within 24 hours"". Customs has intensified patrolling in the seas and conducting joint operations with the CISF, he said.

Delays are prolonging the turn-around time of the ships. Those that used to leave Kandla in three to four days are having to stay back for a week. ""It''s becoming a burden for some importers as with every additional day we have to pay demurrage at $ 3000 to $ 4000 per day"", said an importer.

Also, agents complain that due to inexperience of the CISF in cargo handling procedures, clearing obtained in 12 hours is taking up to four days. Kandla Customs House Agent''s Association president Sunil Chaudhri, however, said ''although we are facing problems, the national security aspect cannot be ignored''.

Currently all the 10 jetties are occupied, with 17 ships waiting for docking. Besides, 21 ships are due to arrive any moment which might add to the congestion, said a source.

Admitting delays in view of the enhanced security since mid-May, KPT Chairman A K Joti said changes were being made to speed up the clearing process.
