0,Cong goes to polls as a divided house,"ahmedabad: the word doing the rounds in the congress is that if the party were to lose the assembly by-election at sabarmati, it would be more because of opposition within the party than because of the bjp. the biggest fear for many congressmen is that if narhari amin wins the elections, it would be a gain for the janata dal (jd) group and of course, for yatin oza, more than the congress (read 'original congress') per se. and this groupism has been evident at the poll campaigns in the sabarkantha parliamentary and sabarmati assembly constituencies, but more so, in the latter. similarly, madhusudan mistry's winning the sabarkantha seat for the party would be seen as shankersinh vaghela's ""third man in the parliament"" and once again would mean nothing much for the original congress, going by the factionalism in the party. but, who is with who and for what, became clearer during campaigns in both the constituencies, which have become prestige issues not only for the main contesting parties but even for the candidates. gujarat pradesh congress committee president amarsinh chaudhary's biggest adversary and former chief minister madhavsinh solanki did not mind addressing at least two meetings with vaghela in the sabarkantha constituency, but his men were hardly seen in sabarmati for obvious reasons. one reason could be that sabarmati is dominated by kadva patels, and there was no place for leaders of obcs and kshatriyas, which solanki and vaghela represent respectively. moreover, sabarkantha is also very close to chaudhary's heart and almost the whole of the congress (old and merged) were doing their best to work towards mistry's victory. at sabarmati, representative of the jd group in the steering committee of the congress, dr urmila patel, turned up with colleague dalsukh godani at kali village on tuesday to add some 'importance' to the campaign, but apart from involvement from these jd colleagues, amin has had few star campaigners. contrarily, the bjp has moved in its entire political men and machinery from saurashtra to campaign for their candidate in sabarmati. thus, amin's campaign is resting more on the strength of the city congress and of course, of oza because of whose resignation, the by-election was warranted. finally, the equation is that ""each to his own"".

""but the government is blaming teachers for private tuition thereby tarnishing their image,"" said basu.
