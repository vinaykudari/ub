3,SC depreciates lawyers' stir,"allahabad: the supreme court has come down heavily on the lawyer's strike here. it has also denounced the strike by employees and workmen and deprecated the `bandh calls' given by various political parties. the suferer could not know the language in which the grievances can be ventilated, especially when all the democratic norms have been exhausted, said g c gahrana, joint secretary, all india lawyers' union. mr gahrana also an advocate, expressed deep concern about the long- drawn lawyer's strike in the high court of judicature here and in subordinate courts of entire western uttar pradesh as well. the lawyers of western uttar pradesh are agitating for their demand of creation of high court bench in western uttar pradesh while the lawyers of the allahabad high court are opposing the same with even more vehemence. this is no secret that the judiciary is paralysed for the last more than a month and the litigants are being compelled to suffer for none of their faults. the agitation was likely to spread in the eastern district also, he said in a press statement. chief justice of india should come to defuse the situation being the head of the indian judiciary. he is also expected to keep a watch in protecting the judicial system and also the interests of the litigants, he added. gahrana has appealed to the prime minister and chief minister not to adopt the ostrich-like approach to the grim situation created by their irksome silence, and decide the issue finally for all times to come. the cji and the judiciary of this vast state should exercise his good office to ask/suggest the government of uttar pradesh as well as of centre to take a positive step to settle the matter by firm decision on either side and let it not be allowed to use the agitation for oblique purposes and also save the judicial system from being collapsed, he said.

4,Mulayam sore at foreign policy,"lucknow: samajwadi party president mulayam singh yadav, has said that the weak foreign policy of the country may result in the country ending up as a battlefield and added the bjp- led government has failed to counter the aftermath of terrorist attacks on the us. unveiling the statue of freedom fighter, ram sagar mishra, at kumrahwa near bakshi ka talab, yadav said it was lamentable that the government could not isolate pakistan at this juncture, aware that it was abetting terrorism in kashmir. he said on the contrary, it was pakistan which appeared to have taken the lead by laying down pre-conditions while extending help to the us. he criticised america for taking the help of pakistan while simultaneously maintaining that it would punish countries which abetted terrorism. yadav said while he had full sympathies with those who died in the terrorist attacks on the twin trade towers and the pentagon, the us could not overlook what kashmir had been witnessing since the past many years.he said there was no account of how many innocent had succumbed to the terrorist bullets in j and k and how many women had been widowed and mothers who had lost their sons. the sp president regretted that knowing the full facts, the us chose to remain quiet. the former defence minister advocated the formation of a joint front of all developed and developing nations for countering the threat of terrorism. referring to the arrest of five simi activists from bahraich, yadav said the bjp government should adopt a similar yardstick for the bajrang dal and the vishwa hindu parishad.

7,Employees flay govt apathy,"kolkata: while the management of the calcutta tramways company chose to remain silent over the government's proposed move to phase out trams from the city, the employees didn't. they see the move as a culmination of a long-time lackadaisical attitude towards the state of tram services. the all india trade union congress-affiliated calcutta tramways workers' union staged a daylong demonstration at the ctc headquarters on r.n. mukherjee road on friday. for years, the government has not made any move to modernise the trams. now they say it is an unviable proposition. a top-heavy administration and their lack of foresight are mainly responsible for the economic crisis that the ctc is in today, said union general secretary paltu dasgupta. only 52 per cent out of a total of 319 trams was utilised by the ctc in 2000-2001, meaning that every day only half the number are in running condition. often the figure comes down to less than 100, said dasgupta. the employees were particularly vexed at the proposed move to introduce light rail transit replacing the trams. if the government can think of spending rs 5,000 crore behind the lrt, can it not provide just rs 5 crore for modernisation of the existing system? queried sunil dubey, an employee at the ctc's esplanade depot. excessive staff was one of the ctc's main problems. with over 7,000 employees, the company has 41 persons for every tram that they possessed. will it be possible for the state government to provide alternative jobs for each one of these 7,000 employees, with factory after factory closing down? dasgupta enquired. in a recent statement in the west bengal legislative assembly, state transport minister subhas chakraborty said the state government was planning to introduce trolley buses in the city. two proposals are pending before the state government, one from russia and the other from china. the chinese proposal was more complete. the state government would have to examine which of the two proposals were more acceptable financially on behalf of the state government. running trolley buses in calcutta is a feasible proposal, he said. to run trams profitably, the tramways would have to be modernised. but, this was an expensive proposition. the cost of modernisation of the 11-kilometre stretch between taratala and esplanade would cost rs 500 crore. to make such a project financially viable, tickets would have to be priced at rs 20 for the stretch. also, the operations would have to be made more efficient. according to figures given by the state government, there were 41 employees to look after a tram. the ctc incurred a loss of rs 2.5 lakh a day. in the current socio-economic condition, such a high fare structure can't be sustained, the minister had said. for the same reason, it might be difficult to introduce trams on the b.t.road. on this stretch, a ticket would have to be priced at rs 30. even the master plan for traffic and transportation of the cmda does not mention anything of ending the tram system. trams have positive advantages as a mass transit mode particularly in the matter of environment considerations, conservation of fuel and passenger carrying capacity, the draft report says. the report has recommended modernisation of the system. tram services may be continued on the routes where exclusive right of way for trams are available, along with modernisation of the tracks, overhead systems and rolling stock. the routes should preferably be shuttle routes for serving the metro corridor, the report says.

9,'Cong bonus offer to farmers a farce',"chandigarh:the shiromani akali dal has termed the congress's offer to give bonus to paddy growers as a political farce aimed at misleading farmers. sad general secretary bs bhunder and state agriculture minister gurdev singh badal said in a joint statement that the congress's offer to pay rs 30 per quintal as bonus was a political gimmick played with an eye on the coming vidhan sabha elections. their reaction came in the wake of the punjab pcc making a commitment to paddy farmers that, in view of paltry increase of rs 20 in minimum support price, the congress would pay bonus of rs 30 per quintal to farmers when it comes to power,after the next vidhan sabha polls. the two sad leaders said that the congress, in the past, had never looked after the interests of farmers and now by offering to pay bonus, if and when the party comes to power, was to mislead farmers. no political party would make such irresponsible and deceptive statements with the presumption that it would surely return to power, they added. both the leaders listed various achievements of the badal government aimed at helping farmers including the recent pressure on the centre for enhancing minimum support price for paddy and the provision of free power and water made by it soon after coming to power. the two leaders regretted that pcc president amarinder singh had recently made a mockery of the farming community by justifying the implementation of the wto provisions. his offer to pay bonus was contrary to what the wto provisions would permit, they said.

13,No investment in new steel plants: Govt,"berhampur: the central government will not encourage financial investment in new steel plants from now on, according to union minister for steel, braja kishore tripathy. pointing out that major steel producing countries had already cut excess production due to lack of market, the union minister said the centre proposed to make some of the core units of the public sector steel industries as joint ventures to make them financially viable. the state governments would be discouraged from providing land for new steel projects, he told reporters here. the minister said the major steel companies in the country had already effected about 30 per cent cut in their production to reduce excess capacity. he said nine major steel industries being promoted by private and joint sectors at an investment of rs 30,000 crore were, at present, under construction in the country. six of them, including two in orissa, were in the final stage, the minister added. tripathy said his ministry did not have any detail about the shore-based steel plant proposed to be set up by tisco at gopalpur near here. it might be in the proposal stage, he said. ruling out closure of any unit of the steel authority of india, he said it had managed to reduce its losses over the last two years. he said sail, which had sustained a net loss of rs 1,700 crore in 1999-2000, brought that down to rs 700 crore last year. by adopting some austerity measures, the loss would be further reduced to rs 300 crore this year, tripathy said. replying to a question about the fate of ailing indian iron & steel company, burnpur, tripathy said sail would submit a proposal on revival of the unit to the board for industrial & financial reconstruction. bifr, which had asked sail to explain why the ailing unit should not be closed down, had set november 4 as the deadline for submitting the revival plan for iisco, he said. the steel ministry, sail authorities and the iisco board would sit together to prepare the revival package, he added.

17,By-elections cheer Cong,"new delhi: the results of the nine by-elections - of which two were for the lok sabha - on september 20, spread across six states, brought little cheer to the ruling bjp: it managed to win only the tonk lok sabha seat which it had won earlier, while its main rival, the congress, won four assembly seats and one lok sabha seat. of the regional parties, the telugu desam party had a setback, losing siddipet, one of the two assembly seats that went to the polls in andhra pradesh, to the newly formed telengana rajya samiti. the tdp retained the vuyyur assembly seat; the biju janata dal, on the other hand, despite the starvation deaths in orissa, managed to retain the rairakhol assembly seat. for the bjp, the results from gujarat - where assembly polls are due next year - were particularly ominous: while it failed to prevent the congress from rewinning the sabarkantha lok sabha seat, it lost the sabarmati assembly seat to that party. sabarmati was, till recently, held by the bjp: a vacancy arose when the sitting bjp mla, yatin oza, quit his seat to protest against the functioning of the keshubhai patel ministry, and joined the congress. another reason for serious concern in the bjp is the fact that sabarmati is one of the assembly segments in the gandhinagar lok sabha seat, which is represented by union home minister l k advani. the congress, whose record is the best in these elections - it has even wrested one assembly seat, sabarmati, from the bjp in gujarat - does, however, have something to worry about. it failed to win the tonk lok sabha seat, which was held and rewon by the bjp, despite the fact that it had made it a prestige issue, pressing into service as many as 12 ministers for the election campaign. it was a personal defeat for chief minister ashok gehlot and is being seen as a mandate against the congress' governmental performance - corruption, an increase in the power tariff and communal tension in parts of the state apparently sealed the congress' fate. not just that, party sources say the powerful jaats - annoyed with the congress for not appointing one among them as cm and who see gehlot as anti-jaat - also played a role in the defeat of the congress. the congress had better luck in two states it rules in the north-east: it retained two assembly seats in assam, one won by chief minister tarun gogoi, and one in arunachal pradesh. for the tdp, the rise of the fledgling telengana rajya samiti - whose k chandrashekhar rao, a former colleague of chief minister n chandrababu naidu, wrested the siddipet seat from the tdp - is worrisome. the tdp has made it clear that it is opposed to the carving out of telengana from andhra pradesh, so much so that its junior partner in the state, the bjp, has had to follow suit and expel one of its mps, a narendra, last week for flying the telengana flag.
