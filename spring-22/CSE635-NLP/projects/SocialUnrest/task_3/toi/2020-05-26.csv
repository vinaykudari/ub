0,Govt fails to convince farmers on contract farming,"CHANDIGARH: The Punjab government has not been able to convince various farmers' outfits that contract farming would do them good. A meeting convened by agriculture minister Rajinder Kaur Bhattal to have an interface between farmers' leaders, experts and officials, including those of the Punjab Agro-Industries Corporation (PAIC), failed to allay the fears of the farmers' bodies, who were unanimous that farmers could not be forced into signing contracts with corporate bodies, including multinationals, as their past experience had been very bitter. The government has chosen contract farming as its diversification mantra to wean away farmers from the wheat-paddy pattern. Besides Bhattal, secretary (agriculture) P K Verma, director (agriculture) R K Rampal, PAIC managing director Himmat Singh and Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) vice-chancellor K S Aulakh shared the government's views while interacting with farmers' representatives. However, Rampal and Aulakh were cautious about giving a carte blanche to the PAIC or corporate bodies and suggested that their expertise should be utilised to benefit farmers. Bhattal assured that the government would protect the interests of the farmers at all costs. She sought farmers' support for the ""humble beginning"" that the PAIC had made with regard to contract farming. She said corrective steps would be taken as and when required since the farmers cannot be left in the lurch. Prominent farmers' leaders who participated in the deliberations included Satnam Singh of the Punjab Technocrat Action Committee, Bhupinder Samber, Hardev Sandhu, Maghar Singh, Prem Singh Bhangu, Pishora Singh and Lahmbar S Taggar. They insisted that farmers were willing to enter into contracts, but the government should ensure beforehand that the farmers get remunerative prices. The government should enter into an agreement or contract with corporate bodies since the farmers can't afford litigation at the individual level if they are duped, considering the financial resources at the disposal of private companies. Farmers' leaders expressed their concern over uncertified seeds being offered by corporate houses to the farmers going in for contract farming. They feared that if uncertified seeds were distributed among farmers without conducting their trial in the soil and weather conditions in the state, it might create serious environmental hazards for other crops. ""If this happens, the damage to the soil could be enormous and irreversible,"" they pointed out. Reposing full faith in PAU experts and extension workers of the directorate of agriculture, farmers' outfits insisted that only those seeds should be permitted in Punjab which, after successful field trials, are approved by PAU. They were of the view that the PAIC and corporate houses, which had no expertise, should be kept away from it. ""Why not involve PAU or experts from the department?"" they suggested. The argument that contract farming would be voluntary failed to convince them. They argued that contract farming would have a binding effect on farmers once it has the backing of the government. They, however, clarified that they were not opposed to diversification provided the government assures them a minimum support price on the pattern of paddy and wheat.

1,"Fish, prawn farming picking up","JALANDHAR: More and more farmers in a desperate attempt to escape from the risky paddy-wheat rotation are taking to diverse agricultural alternatives, the latest being fish and prawn farming. Prawn farming was taken up by seven villages in Punjab this year alone. These are Badshapur, Kapurpind, Kah Kalan and Barra Pind in Jalandhar district, Dogawalli village in Kapurthala district, Punnia village in Sangrur district and Kishanpur in Ropar district. Villagers were motivated to take up prawn farming because it is remunerative, said sources. Fish farmers are getting Rs 70,000 net profit per year from one hectare pond area, according to figures form the Punjab fisheries department. D S Sahota from Barra Pind said that fish farming has come as a blessing for his village as it has prevented the youth from Punjab going out in search of foreign visas. ""There is a good return, less risk factors and easier marketing than traditional agriculture. Farmers have the land and so construct ponds on that land,"" said Sahota. ""Farmers have developed not only low-lying, marshy and waste land, but even fertile agricultural land, probably because there is not much of a future for the wheat-paddy cycle,"" he added. According to Dr Sawinder Singh, director and warden of fisheries, Punjab, ""The state had 5,726 units at present covering a total area of 7,327 hectares under fish culture. Out of this 2,686 units had been set up by farmers on their own land covering an area of 3,084.36 hectares. The remaining 3,037 are panchayati village ponds covering 4,242.87 hectares. The total fish production in the state from all sources has touched 6,579.93 metric tonnes."" He said as many as 2,113 persons were given basic training during 2002-2003 in fish farming. ""A total of Rs 556.49 lakh in loans were arranged from financial institutions for the fish farmers. The state has achieved a breakthrough in fish seed production with the setting up of fish farms, he added.

2,New minister a criminal: Cong,"BHOPAL: The state Congress has accused the BJP-led Centre of ""giving political protection to criminals"" by inducting Prahlad Singh Patel, a BJP MP from Madhya Pradesh, into the Union cabinet. The Congress alleges the state police has at least 23 criminal cases registered against the new cabinet minister under 77 sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), including attempt to murder. Patel, the MP from Balaghat, was included in PM Vajpayee's cabinet on Saturday. The state PCC has brought out a list of 16 cases registered against him between 1983-96. All these 16 are sub judice while seven more are still part of police records, state Congress president Radhakishan Malviya alleged. ""The BJP has marred the image of Indian democracy by giving political recognition to a person with a criminal background,"" the PCC chief alleged. Most of the cases are registered in Gotegaon police station, near Jabalpur. ""In 1983, two cases were filed against Patel in Gotegaon for rioting and attacking police personnel on duty,"" Malviya claimed. According to the state police, Prahlad Patel was registered under sections 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting armed with deadly weapon), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), 186 (obstructing public servant from discharge of duty), 332 (causing hurt to public servant to deter him from discharging duty) of the IPC. Another case was registered the same year for attempt to murder, rioting and unlawful assembly. In 1984, Patel had allegedly illegally detained an official, heckled and abused him. From 1985 to 1996, at least 12 cases were registered against him for rioting, attacking the police and other government employees in the state Electricity Board. ""The government that promises to give a country a clean and terror free environment has inducted a criminal as a minister,"" said Rameshwar Nikhra, the state PCC vice-president.

3,Bandh to protest appointment of teachers partial,"RANCHI: The two-day Jharkhand bandh beginning on Monday was partial and largely peaceful in the state. The bandh has been called by pro-domicile groups in protest against the government's decision to hold tests through the Jharkhand Public Service Commission for recruitment of 10,000 primary teachers without first settling the local resident issue. The premise of outfits like the Jharkhand Adivasi Moolvasi Janadhikaar Manch and Jharkhand Front is that only local residents and not Biharis are entitled to jobs in the state. Despite the extensive security arrangements made by the government and an appeal by the chamber of commerce president to keep shops and other business establishments open, all the shops remained closed for fear of violence. Traffic was sparse on the roads though some public transport as well as private vehicles plied on the main thoroughfares. Banks and offices functioned normally. Passengers were, however, badly affected as few Bihar State Road Transport Corporation buses plied. Train services were reported to be normal. According to DGP R R Prasad, the situation remained largely peaceful in the state on Monday. Apart from a truck being torched on the Ranchi-Tata highway on Sunday night and some youths being held with a petrol bomb in Bariyatu, no untoward incident was reported from anywhere else. Ranchi and Jamshedpur have been identified as sensitive by the police for Tuesday's teachers' recruitment test for which two and five CRPF companies have been deployed respectively. Two RAF companies and 500 JAP and DAP personnel have been deputed in Ranchi, while one RAF company and 150 DAP and JAP personnel have been deployed in Jamshedpur. In every other district, 50 to 100 additional DAP and JAP personnel have been deployed. The police have rounded up 34 bandh supporters since Sunday night, including one in Ranchi, 12 each in Jamtara and Chaibasa, and nine in Pakur (Santhal Pargana). The bandh evoked mixed response in the Singhbhum region. It had no impact in Jamshedpur as business establishments and government offices functioned normally. The rail traffic too was not affected. Long-distance buses remained off the road in the region. However, shopkeepers downed their shutters in the tribal pockets of Karandi, Parsudih and Sundernagar on the outskirts of Jamshedpur. Bandh supporters allegedly set ablaze a truck and assaulted its driver at Ghatsila in East Singhbhum district. Officials said the bandh was near total in West Singhbhum and Saraikela-Kharsawan districts. The police on Monday forwarded three Jharkhand Mukti Morcha activists to judicial custody for trying to stop chief minister Arjun Munda's convoy at Chowka under the Chandil police station of Saraikela-Kharsawan district on Sunday evening. The JMM members had raised slogans against Munda and burnt his effigy in protest against the government's ""adamant attitude"" on appointment of teachers. The party has threatened to stop candidates coming from outside the state from appearing in the written test on Tuesday. The tribal outfit has said only adivasis and the moolvasis would be allowed to appear in the examination. In Dhanbad, the bandh failed to evoke any response.

7,HC dismisses Jadeja's plea for selection,"NEW DELHI: Ajay Jadeja's plans to find a place in the Indian cricket team again suffered a set back on Monday when the Delhi High Court dismissed his petition for permission to play at the national and international level. Justice Manmohan Sarin dismissed Jadeja's plea seeking Board of Control for Cricket in India's (BCCI) nod to be eligible for selection to the team. An accused in the match-fixing controversy, Jadeja had been let off the hook by Justice J K Mehra, who early this year set aside the five-year ban imposed on him after the match-fixing controversy. The counsel for BCCI, Kapil Sibal, argued that the cricketer's plea can not be entertained as the board had challenged Justice Mehra's verdict. Earlier, a Division Bench of the court had asked BCCI to consider the cricketer for Ranji Trophy matches, but had referred the matter to Justice Sarin after BCCI's counsel submitted that the verdict had already been challenged before a single Bench. The cricketer had accused the board of trying to prevent him from taking part not only in Ranji Trophy, but also a charity match in South Africa. Justice J K Mehra, who had been appointed by the high court, had ruled in Jadeja's favour saying that former CBI director Madhvan's report on the cricketer's involvement in match-fixing was illegal. The board's objections to the Justice Mehra verdict will come up for hearing on July 8. Justice Mehra had ruled in Jadeja's favour making him eligible for playing international and domestic cricket again. In doing so, he had set aside the findings of the disciplinary committee. He had ruled that Jadeja has the right to play domestic and international cricket subject to his selection by the BCCI. Jadeja had approached the high court on February 2, 2001, challenging the banimposed on him on the basis of Madhavan committee recommendations.

8,State government issues new guidelines for hoardings,"MUMBAI: The urban development department of the Maharashtra government has framed draft rules seeking to check rampant tree cutting and defacing of historic and other buildings in Mumbai to erect hoardings. It will now be the responsibility of advertising agencies to protect trees upto a distance of 25 metres on either side of the hoarding. The agency concerned will have to deposit Rs 2,500 per existing tree with the municipal corporation. Citizens have been asked to send their suggestions and objections to the draft rules which have been issued following a public outcry over vandalising public spaces and trees. The issue was brought to the fore last year by Dr Anahita Pandole, a city gynaecologist, with a public interest litigation in the Mumbai high court. When contacted on Monday, Dr Pandole said she was not aware of the rules though she was following the case. However, a reading of the rules by this paper shows that the penalty for violation of the rules is not harsh enough -the maximum fine is of Rs 500. Moreover, the municipal commisioner may, in his discretion and by order in writing, regularise the isntallation of unauthorised hoarding by charging a compounding fee not exceeding five times the chargeable fee, the rules say. The rules prohibit hoardings which obstruct the view of the sea, sunrise or sunset. Hoardings would also not be permitted on buildings of historical importance or inside mangroves, creeks or sea or within 500 metres of the high tide line. Aglencies, which have been permitted to erect hoardings prior to coming into force of the new rules, will have the option to replace tall trees upto a distance of 25 meteters on either side of the hoarding by such species as may be approved by the superintendent of guardens of the corporation and deposit with the BMC Rs 500 per tree to have it replanted by the superintendent. Several big companies and advertisement agencies have in the past flouted BMC guidelines on hoardings and defaced several buildings and cut trees. While no hoardings are to be allowed on footpaths, it is proposed to permit advertisements on guard rails or metal bars fixed on the road.

9,Naidu swears by 'people-ism' to win election,"HYDERABAD: Ruling out the possibility of advancing assembly polls, the chief minister on Monday exuded confidence that he would secure a thumping victory in the next elections. ""People are not against me and hundred per cent I will come back to power,"" he said in an exclusive interview with The Times of India on the eve TDP's Mahanadu, the annual stocktaking exercise. ""I have not committed any mistake and I will request the people to vote for me for their and their children's future and welfare,"" Naidu said. On the issue of support to the NDA, he said that the TDP would continue its alliance with the BJP. ""I want to maintain the status quo,"" Naidu said. Regarding the string of welfare measures bordering on populism - contrary to his image of being a reformist politician - he said that they didn't amount to populism but only ""people-ism."" He alleged that the Congress was trying to create a wrong impression about the government's efforts. Naidu said, ""Through reforms I have improved the resource collection in various departments, obtained loans from foreign agencies and spent the same on the welfare of the people."" Naidu said that reforms meant better service to the common man, adding that welfare programmes were there even in the US for the benefit of the aged and others. He also maintained nobody in the country had taken hard decisions on reforms like he had. Referring to the Mahanadu, he said it's message to the people is that the party would always be ""with them and near to them"". The Tirupati Mahanadu is expected to come with an action plan to benefit the farmers and announce welfare measures for the backward classes and other vulnerable sections of the society, he said. Naidu, who's averse to any immediate changes either in the party or government, said that the party has been rewarding meritorious workers. The chief minister, however, was non-committal on an election cabinet. ""I have not given any thought to it so far,"" he said. Regarding the public perception that he has centralised the functioning of the government, he said: ""It is not correct, all decisions are taken with an open mind. Nobody can influence me with wrong ideas. During the last eight years, the TDP has not taken any wrong decisions. The process of consultation is elaborate and I am taking strong decisions after getting feedbacks."" Naidu claimed credit for making development an election agenda in the country. On Y S Rajasekhara Reddy's padayatra, he said, ""Perhaps I am the most travelled chief minister in the country and these padayatras will not have any impact on the elections and people know who is what.""

10,Family of five commits suicide in city,"KOLKATA: A family of five set themselves on fire early on Monday in their two-room apartment in the northern suburb of Sodepur. The charred bodies were discovered in the morning by police and fire brigade personnel. The bodies of Ajay Bhattacharya, 41, his wife Aparna, 32, and their children Ankita, 13, Nikita, 11, and Ronit, 7, were found in the same room. Around 5 am, neighbours noticed smoke billowing out of the Bhattacharya home. ""We informed the police and fire brigade immediately,"" said Bappa Ghosh, son of the apartment's landlady. Preliminary investigation revealed a financial crisis led to the tragedy. The children were possibly administered sedatives before the fire was started. Neighbours recall seeing lights in the Bhattacharya home till after 1 am. ""The parents could have been waiting for the children to go to sleep. That is why the fire was set early in the morning,"" a police officer said. The bodies of the husband and wife were found on the floor. Aparna's hands were loosely tied and she had no clothes on her. The children were on the bed and the boy's legs were tied. All the pictures and idols of gods and goddesses were facing the wall. There was little indication the family was contemplating such a gory end. Aparna's sister, who came visiting on Sunday evening and left around 8 pm, noticed nothing amiss. ""She could not fathom how her sister's family could have taken this step,"" a police officer of Ghola PS in Sodepur said. Ajay was a former employee of Union Bank at Raipur in Chhattisgarh. He had rented the flat eight years ago. Ajay quit his job a few years ago and began supplying chemicals and graphite to the Bhilai steel plant. He would visit his family once every two to three months. On Sunday, Ajay had returned for one of his usual visits. Neighbour Nitai Saha said there were signs that the family was passing through a financial crisis. He said Aparna had mentioned that her children had not got their report cards for the last academic year as their fees were not paid. Ronit studied at Ramakrishna Vivekananda Mission, his two sisters at Sister Nivedita School. ""The Bhattacharyas kept aloof, but Aparna would call neighbourhood children over for birthday parties and festivals. But that had stopped of late,"" Saha added.

11,New I-T rules make liquor traders jittery,"KOLKATA: The Centre has asked liquor shop owners to pay income-tax at the rate of 10 per cent extra over their total purchase from manufacturers and dealers per annum from June 1. The order has made not only annoyed the wine traders but also the state government. The reason: this may lead to a drop in sales and have a cascading effect on the state exchequer which is highly dependent on the income from excise duty. The boozers, on the other hand, may have to cough up more as the traders are likely to pass the buck on them. State excise minister Probodh Sinha said the Union budget had made the proposal which led to protests from traders. However, the finance Bill has been passed recently in Parliament, approving the proposal. Henceforth, sellers of country liquor, Indian-made foreign liquor and imported booze will have to pay tax at a ""flat rate of 10 per cent"", to be deducted at source. ""They have to pay Rs 10 extra for making a purchase of Rs 100,"" Sinha said. The state is more worried about its impact on the country liquor trade as it is government-controlled.

12,CM tells party leaders to keep off Tirumala,"HYDERABAD: With the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) being badgered by ruling party bigwigs for accommodation, chief minister Chandrababu Naidu on Monday sent out instructions that no party leader attending the Mahanadu in Tirupati should stay in the more salubrious Tirumala where the shrine of Lord Venkateshwara attracts thousands of pilgrims everyday. Ministers and senior party functionaries are pressuring the temple administration to reserve a large number of rooms for their supporters during the three-day Mahanadu. The leaders wanted to camp on the hills and attend the Mahanadu at Tirupati everyday as the temperature at Tirumala is relatively low compared to Tirupati. Official sources told The Times of India that a senior minister wanted more than 40 rooms on the hills for himself and his party leaders. Another minister from Hyderabad sent a message to the temple authorities to reserve about 20 rooms meant for very important persons at Tirumala to accommodate his followers. The TDP leaders are bringing their families also to the hills, it is learnt. Several TDP activists attending the Mahanadu have taken recommendation letters to get accommodation at Tirumala. The ministers planned to arrange for the darshan of Lord Venkateshwara for their followers. However, the temple administration made arrangements for the party delegates during the three-day period. Naidu, who came to know about the happenings, instructed minister N Gopalakrishna Reddy, who is supervising arrangements at Tirupati to see that all TDP leaders stay at the venue of Mahanadu. Naidu also wanted to avoid any hardship to pilgrims because of the party event.

14,Weatherman rules out early rain,"NEW DELHI: The monsoon will not hit Kerala this week, says the meteorological department. The latest indications are it may stick to its scheduled date of June 1 or be a little late. But it will certainly not be early. India Meteorological Department's S K Subramanian said on Monday that the Bay of Bengal branch of the southwest monsoon has shown signs of strengthening. But the southwesterly flow hasn't built up as far as the Arabian Sea branch of the monsoon is concerned. This is why IMD is ruling out any early arrival. Subramanian is quick to clarify the uncertainties which will remain even after the monsoon arrives in Kerala. Arrival is no indication of its pace of progress into the country. Nor will it decide in any way how much rain the season will bring. The monsoon entered the Andaman Sea around its normal date of mid-May. But a tropical cyclone in the Bay of Bengal, which showed up on May 8 and crossed the Myanmar coast on May 19, disturbed the circulation patterns. The met office waited for it to pass and the flows to resettle before assessing the monsoon's progress.

15,"MUL warns of pinch on sales, profits","NEW DELHI: Ahead of its maiden public offer to hit the market next month, car major Maruti has warned that company sales and profits could come under pressure due to increasing competition. Maruti which notched up a hefty 40 per cent jump in net profit to Rs 146 crore during 2002-03, attributed a host of factors including competition based on prices, product performance, brand image and new models for the pressure saying 'we operate in a highly competitive environment and competitive pressure on our business is likely to continue'. In its draft prospectus filed with market regulator SEBI, the car market leader said ""our net profits have fluctuated during last three years, including a net loss in fiscal 2001. While we achieved profits in 2002, we may face a decline in profits or a reduction in sales volumes in future due to intense competition"". Government, which holds 45 per cent stake in the joint venture along with Japanese car giant Suzuki Motor Corporation, will offload 25 per cent stake through a public offering. This would be followed a second tranche of 20 per cent, paving the way for the exit of government from the company. Last year SMC acquired management control over the company after hiking its stake through a Rs 400 crore rights issue which sold for a premium of Rs 1000 crore. Maruti was the only manufacturer in the entry level 'A' segment while in 'B' segment it faced competition from at least three other car makers, it said.

16,"Police firing in Ranchi, two protestors killed","RANCHI: Two people, including a 10-year-old child, were killed when police opened fire at violent tribals in Ranchi. Protesters resorted to violence during the controversial teachers' recruitment test on Tuesday. In another incident, Deputy Commissioner Jai Shanker Tiwari said, a petrol bomb was lobbed inside St Louis high school, an examination centre, at Harmu. Swift action by the strong contingent of security force brought the situation under control by dispersing a group of bandh supporters. Nobody was injured in the melee. In Pakur, police arrested over twenty bandh supporters for enforcing the bandh. Unconfirmed reports said police opened fire at another centre where a mob attempted to disrupt the test. Meanwhile, non-receipt of admit cards for the examination have left many examinees stranded. While some candidates were roaming outside some centres, many were found sitting in front of the state Public Service Commission. There was thin traffic on the road while almost all the shops in the state capital downed their shutters. A Jamshedpur report said when JMM activists tried forcibly to stop examination at a centre at Khasmahal in the steel city, police intervened and in the ensuing encounter several rounds of fire were exchanged.

19,'Enact law to help NRI brides',"CHANDIGARH: President of Lok Bhalai Party Balwant Singh Ramoowalia has urged the Punjab government to call a special session of the Vidhan Sabha to discuss the problem of young girls abandoned by their nonresident Indian (NRI) husbands. At a news conference on Tuesday, Ramoowalia said it was time that the government evolves some legislation to help these victims get redressal. The incidence of NRI-Punjabi youths coming to Punjab, marrying girls for money and dowry, and deserting them after a few weeks or years is very high. In fact, two or three girls in every village has such a tale to narrate, he said. The NRIs cash in on the parents' desire to provide their daughters a good life abroad and even hide the fact that they have been married before. These deserted wives become unwanted dependents on their in-laws and parents and their misery is further compounded if they are pregnant or have children. Ramoowalia lamented that most of the time the government machinery, which is supposed to protect the victimised person, acts against them. Coming out against the role of the police, he said that instead of booking the guilty groom's family, the police try to put pressure on the girl and her parents to reach a compromise and settle for divorce. ""The phenomenon has become so rampant that it is equivalent to organised crime. The government must frame a Punjab Control of Organised Crime Act on line of one existing in Maharashtra for action against guilty grooms and their families,"" said Ramoowalia. If the NRI husband does not send the migration papers within 90 days of marriage an FIR should be registered. The photograph of the married couple should be pasted on the groom's passport and duly attested. Within seven days of marriage, the girl should be declared the owner of all the property of the groom in India. NRIs without certified divorce papers from a previous wife must be stopped from re-marrying in India. The state government must take up such cases and declare the NRIs as proclaimed offenders, request the Centre to take up revocation of NRI status with the govt of that country. Police should resist and negate any political pressure favouring the groom and erring police officials should be punished.
