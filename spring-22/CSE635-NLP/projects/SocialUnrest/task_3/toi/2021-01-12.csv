2,Sonia jacks up party spirit,"LUCKNOW: Sonia Gandhi, in election mode on her three -day road show in western UP, surprised many by her spontaneity. According to eyewitnessesâ€™ accounts, the Congress president made many unscheduled stoppages along the route, mingled freely with the masses and even visited houses at random to utter delight of the villagers during her whirlwind tour which began on January 10. A â€˜sociable Soniaâ€™ buoyed up the spirits of the UP Congress leaders, who see better poll prospects for the party with the image make-over.

According to UPCC vice-president Santosh Singh, who accompanied her on the road show along with UPCC chief Jagdambika Pal, the Congress president had done her homework well. She was obviously well briefed about the peculiar problems of the districts she visited and cleverly used the information to drive her point home during the interactive sessions with the masses.

So she had something for everyone, Singh pointed out. The major thrust of her address in the sugar cane belt of Meerut and Muzaffarnagar, for instance, he said, was the plight of cane farmers as she lambasted both the state and the central governments for their criminal apathy towards their interests. The approaching elections, she declared, was the right opportunity to help throw out the anti-farmer government.

In Bharhaut and Sambal, with substantial number of minority populace, she played the secular card. She also targeted the saffron party for reneging on its promise of providing jobs to one crore unemployed youth, and called upon them to reject the unreliable.

And, then, there was the â€œwoman cardâ€� which proved to be great winner. Congress sources narrated how Sonia visited a household en route Meerut on Sunday and gave away her shawl to the young bride as â€œmuh dikhaiâ€� when the latter offered her a cup of tea. â€œThe female response this time surpassed all our expectations,â€� declared a highly excited Singh.

The road show, which began from Khurja in Bulanshahar, concluded in Muzaffarnagar on Monday. The response in Khurja turned out to be tremendous to an emotionally surcharged Sonia who was told that it was the last halt of Rajiv Gandhi where he addressed the crowd, undertaking the fatal journey to Shri Perumbudur.

The party president launched her mass contact programme from the western belt under a calculated strategy, as the area has large chunk of floating votes, sources confide adding this time she proposes to broadbase the programme and will also cover central UP and eastern districts.

3,Traders protest new LMC tax,"LUCKNOW: Agitated traders of the weekly make-shift markets organised a sit-in in front of the Lucknow Municipal Corporation (LMC) on Monday, to protest the anti-trader stance adopted by the LMC officials. The LMC had recently introduced a contract system for collecting tax from weekly markets despite the fact that traders were already paying tehbazaari.

On a call given by the Weekly Market Tradersâ€™ Welfare Association, hundreds of traders gathered in front of the LMC office and staged a dharna. Traffic movement was disrupted as excited traders blocked the road and raised anti-LMC slogans. The dharna was later transformed into a meeting with association leaders addressing the traders.

Association head, Ahmad Deen Qureshi warned that if the LMC did not put an end to the new contract system, the traders would refuse to deposit tehbazaari tax with the LMC. Shyam Lal Valmiki, patron of the association, said the weekly market traders were being victimised by the LMCâ€™s top brass. Rebuking the latest move by the LMC officials, he added that this step was highly malicious and uncaring. The dharna concluded with the handing over of memorandums to the municipal commissioner and the additional city magistrate, Lucknow.

Later, talking to Times News Network, Valmiki said that recently, a memorandum in this regard was handed over to chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav and the minister for urban development, Azam Khan. He added that the duo assured the association representatives that the traders would not be exploited.

â€œAfter this guarantee from the government, this decision of the LMC is absolutely unjust and would not be accepted by the traders,â€� he said. Valmiki further stated that in the year 2001, it was the LMC that introduced tehbazaari, for directly collecting the tax from the traders while putting an end to the contractor system.

4,State BJP well into election mode,"AHMEDABAD: Although the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party has only recently announced its ''entry into the election mode'', it has already completed its first round of mass-contact programme.

5,East-west Metro link modified,"KOLKATA: It is not going to be from Rajarhat to Ramrajatala as planned earlier.

A survey report submitted to the Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority last month by Pacific Consultant International has proposed a new Metro link between Rajarhat New Town and New Dasnagar, via Sealdah and Howrah stations.

According to the feasibility study on the East-West Metro Corridor of Kolkata, the proposed rail link would take off from a depot at Rajarhat, cross the Bagjola Canal and then come up to the first station close to Rajarhat-II. From there, it would go straight to Rajarhat-I and then, crossing the Krishnapur Canal, enter Salt Lake Sector V.

Within Salt Lake, the link would come close to Karunamoyee and then pass through Sector II of Bidhannagar along Central Park, before entering Sector I. As soon as the link reaches E.M.

Bypass, it would cross the thoroughfare and go past the Bengal Chemical complex.

From there it would come directly to the Kankurgachhi crossing and then run along the Maniktala Main Road. The link would turn left as soon as it reaches the Eastern Railwayâ€™s Dum Dum junction-Sealdah link near Narkeldanga and run along the suburban tracks till it hits Sealdah station.

Touching Sealdah, the East-West link would go along B.B. Ganguly Street and join the existing Metro route from Dum Dum to Tollygunge under C.R. Avenue.

After that, the link would continue along B.B. Ganguly Street and again take a right turn just ahead of Writersâ€™. Circling the state secretariat, the link would cross the Hooghly to reach Howrah station. The tracks would carry on, crossing the G.T. Road up to Dasnagar via Kadamtala. Finally, the tracks would end close to New Dasnagar.

The proposed Metro will have three types of stations: Type A, which is Rajarhat phase II at the ground level; Type B, the elevated stations on a viaduct from Rajarhat I to Bengal Chemical in Kolkata and Kadamtala to New Dasnagar in Howrah; and Type C, or the underground stations between Kankurgachhi and Howrah Maidan.

Two tubular structures have also been proposed for the trains to run under the Hooghly, linking Kolkata and Howrah.

6,Simultaneous polls possible: Bhajan Lal,"CHANDIGARH: Haryana Congress president and former chief minister Bhajan Lal on Tuesday said that there was every possibility that the Chautala government might recommend holding of Assembly elections in the state along with the Lok Sabha poll.

Bhajan Lal, who was talking to media persons after the installation of Sumeeta Singh as the president of the Haryana Pradesh Mahila Congress in place of Anita Yadav, Bhajan Lal said the Congress in the state was fully prepared to fight both the elections and the masses wanted to get rid of the present regime at the earliest.

Chief Minister Om Prakash Chautala, however, categorically stated in Ambala on Monday that there was no move to hold Assembly elections in the state simultaneously with the Lok Sabha poll. He said his government would complete its full term and the Assembly elections would be held as per the scheduled date, i.e. February-March, 2005.

In reply to a question, Bhajan Lal expressed confidence that if the present mood of the people was an indication, the Congress would win all the 10 Lok Sabha seats in the state and at least 70 out of a total of 90 Assembly seats.

Asked if any date has been fixed for Sonia Gandhi''s visit to Haryana, Bhajan Lal said she might address a rally at Hisar in February or March, but no programme had so far been finalised for her visit. He stressed that the masses in the country would give a befitting rebuff to the BJP this time for raking up time and again Sonia Gandhi''s foreign origin.

Later, talking to media persons, Sumeeta Singh said that her first task was to strengthen the hands of Sonia Gandhi and Bhajan Lal by mobilising women''s support for the Congress in the state so as to enable the party to make a clean sweep in the coming elections.

She said she had already urged HPCC chief to allot at least 33 per cent of Lok Sabha and Assembly seats to women candidates in the ensuing elections. Asked if the party had so many winning women candidates, she said women in Haryana were very enterprising and given a chance they would definitely show their worth.

She revealed that the Mahila Congress would organise a state-level rally at Bhiwani on January 24 which would be addressed among others by all-India Mahila Congress president Reeta Bahuguna.

When asked to comment on rampant factionalism in the state Congress, Reeta Singh said there was no dissidence or factionalism in the party. It was only difference of opinion which was a natural phenomenon in a democratic set-up, observed Mahila congress president stressing that the party was fully united under the leadership of Bhajan Lal.

8,Universities need to become techno-business incubators,"BANGALORE: Technological universities in the country should not stop at churning out lakhs of engineers every year without job opportunities, and instead concentrate on promoting techno-entrepreneurship and become technology buisness incubators.

University vice chancellors, college principals, educationists and leading R&D chiefs of the country who met in Bangalore on Tuesday seemed to agree on this strategy to shift the focus in technological universities to meet President Kalam''s Vision 2020 of India being in the league of developed countries.

A two-day workshop ''India Vision 2020: Role of Technological Universities'' took off at the Indian Institute of Science, to ultimately evolve a theme paper that will detail strategies and missions necessary to meet the needs detailed in Vision 2020 in education and related fields.

Shivathanu Pillai, chief controller of R&D, DRDO stressed on how technical education is important in every fields because everything today is technology-driven. ``We need to link R&D and industry and need to promote hi-tech research that will create a reverse brain drain, attract other countries too,'' he said. Speaking on `Missions for Developed India: Vision 2020'', he analysed the hurdles in the way of development -- developed countries develop hi-tech systems under control regimes and technology denials.

Developing countries buy these same technologies to meet their immediate requirements from these developed countries. ``This creates a lack of conducive environment for higher learning and hi-tech research,'' explained Pillai, also CEO of Brahmos.

A national mission `Reach'' was working with a goal of upgrading technological universities to the level of IITs and at least 50 institutions nationwide were being targetted at present for this programme. But unfortunately, many institutions were unwilling to come forward an be a part of this programme.

He also called for specific missions and goals to be set saying: ``Whenever the nation has had a focussed mission, we have succeeded,'' said PIllai calling technological universities to tie-up with industry to work toward the vision.

Visveswaraiah Technological University (VTU) vice chancellor K.Balaveera Reddy said: ``Universities have to mould courses to meet global needs. Universities need more skill-oriented programmes, specially in the service sector.'' Universities should also take the reponsibility of technology transfers to rural areas, he said. ``Every institution should become a technology business incubator so that students develope their own products.'' He emphasised that while job opportunities for engineers were dwindling, preventing the set up of new engineering colleges was not a solution.
