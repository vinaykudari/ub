0,Traders’ body gives call for bandh on July 9,"VARANASI: The UP Udyog Vyapar Pratinidhi Mandal (UPUVPM) has given a call of state bandh on July 9 in protest against the alleged harassment of traders and other issues like power rostering, increasing menace of criminals and introduction of CP tax.

The traders will take out a protest marches and torch processions in every city on July 1 and 7.

Giving this information at a press conference, the UPUVPM general secretary, Banwari Lal Kanchal said that earlier the traders had decided to meet the chief minister Mayawati to hold a talk and submit a 17-point charter of demands.

But she denied to meet them before the expansion of the state cabinet, he said adding that the apathetic attitude of the CM towards the problems of the traders forced them to adopt a war path against the government. He said that the traders are still hopeful that the CM will take initiative to avoid agitation in the state.

Kanchal was here to participate in a meeting of traders. He said that it was surprising that the trade tax department was trying to harass the traders for booking their goods in railways. He said that in the case of economic crime only monetary punishment could be given, but the railway officials were deliberately lodging FIRs against the traders. He said that petty traders including sari manufacturers and food grains sellers, who are not registered in the sales tax department, are going to face a serious problem as the government has made a provision of filling of form C for all traders.

Expressing concern over attacks on traders in the state, he alleged that the government was not interested in improving law and order situation. He alleged that bureaucrats were conducting raids at the industries and the houses of industrialists to exploit them. He said that they are never interested in increasing revenue realisation, but they are filling their pockets by blackmailing the industrialists and traders.

2,Agri policy a conspiracy of MNCs: CPI,"KOLKATA: In a criticism of West Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee''s proposed agricultural policy, which was suggested by US consultancy firm Mckinsey, allowing contract farming by multinationals, the CPI on Thursday described it as a conspiracy hatched by MNCs to capture West Bengal''s agricultural sector.

Demanding that the Left Front government should immediately withdraw the Mckinsey-sponsored policy, the CPI suggested that in place of contract farming, the government should go in for agricultural cooperatives and encourage cooperative movement.

The CPI also demanded on Thursdaythat the government should refrain from placing the proposed policy at the state cabinet meeting on June 27.

""If the Mckinsey sponsored policy is implemented, the small and marginal farmers in the state will lose all their rights including their rights on land,"" CPI state secretary Manju Majumdar said on Thursday. ""There is bound to be far reaching consequences. Everywhere in the world, contract farming has driven more people below the poverty line,"" he observed.

The CPI leader said that his party would prepare a note charting out an alternative path of agricultural growth and would submit it before the government. Also, a booklet, outlying the dangers of the Mckinsey sponsored policy, would be distributed among the farmers in the villages.

4,Laloo calls for unity at youth rally,"PATNA: RJD national chief Laloo Prasad Yadav on Thursday called upon the Kushwaha youths to unite under one banner to serve the nation besides promoting their own cause.

Addressing the Kushwaha youth rally organised at the Miller High School grounds, Laloo said that there was differences among the Kushwaha caste people due to which â€œthe just cause of its members were hamperedâ€�.

He accused the expelled RJD MP, Nagmani, of having betrayed the cause of Kushwahas. Laloo claimed that Nagmani had come closer to the the killers of his father, Jagdev Prasad, a noted socialist leader. Laloo used the occasion to talk about the rallies organised by him in the early nineties to promote unity among various backward castes and depressed classes. Laloo, however, maintained that he had addressed only a few Yadav rallies.

â€œIt is not easy to bind together the backward castes whose members start going wayward and do not try to come together for a common cause,â€� he said. Laloo criticised the Central government for hiking the petrol price to Rs 30 per litre and diesel price to Rs 20 per litre.

5,LF govt faces a football challenge,"KOLKATA: At the siliver jubilee of its uninterrputed rule in West Bengal, the Left Front government finds itself at crossroads.

That a giant television screen will have to be set up at the Netaji Indoor Stadium on Thursday to show the England-Brazil match and ensure a reasonable turnout when the formal function will be held to celebrate the occasion is symbolic of the challenges the comrades still face.

Even after creating history by remaining in power for 25 years and reducing the entire opposition in the state to a virtual non-entity, CPM leaders were aware of the difficulties that still stared them on the face. In between, communism had taken a back seat globally, leaving the Marxists in the state quite isolated in the global arena.

The all-pervasive power of the market has invaded West Bengal as well. With land prices going up rapidly in several areas, the utility of keeping sharecroppers tied to their plots through barga rights is now under question.

Saddled with an empty government coffer, inadequate resource mobilisation and mounting unemployment, the LF government now feels that it will have to woo private investment to create employment.

Unable to grow much beyond West Bengal, Kerala and Tripura, the Front finds its parliamentary-red revolution a far cry. It has now to accept requirements of globalisation which Delhi has ushered in.

6,Rs 800-cr ADB loan by Nov: Kerala minister,"THIRISSUR: Kerala expects to get the first instalment of Rs 800 crore loan from Asian Development Bank by November next, Finance Minister K Sankaranarayanan said on Friday.

The minister told the reporters here that the final round of discussions with ADB officials on securing Rs 3600 crore loan would be completed by next month.

The loan would carry an interest rate of 8.05 per cent.

The cost-cutting measures clamped by the UDF government had helped Kerala''s fiscal position to improve in the last one year.

""Government today is in a position to pay salary to employees regularly and the sales tax collection has been impressive since the UDF came to power a year ago,"" he said.

Besides, government had been able to recover Rs 80 crore towards sales tax outstanding. Government would soon clear a sum of Rs 160 crore due to contractors for executing works and ensure that the cheques would not bounce due to ""treasury failure"" he said.

7,George rules out talks with Hurriyat,"JAMMU: Defence minister George Fernandes on Friday ruled out any talks with the secessionist All-Party Hurriyat Conference (APHC) saying that the conglomerate had spurned the Centreâ€™s initiative when K C Pant had visited Kashmir.

Talking to reporters here, he said there was no question of talking to the Hurriyat as the Centre had already taken a tough stance on the secessionist body. He pointed out that senior Hurriyat leader Ali Shah Geelani was already in jail. The defence minister was responding to a reporterâ€™s query on whether the Centre was ready to talk to the Hurriyat Conference leaders even if it alienated the National Conference (NC).

Some newspaper reports from Srinagar had quoted Fernandes as saying that the doors were open for talks with the Hurriyat. On Friday, he made it clear that there was no such proposal before the Centre. Fernandes pointed out that in Srinagar, he was asked by a reporter whether the Centre would be willing to talk to the Hurriyat if the latter initiated a move. He said he had replied that the request could be considered.

On the issue of infiltration from across the border, he said it had come down significantly in the recent past, but there was no proposal to demobilise the troops from the borders.

9,Forest minister threatens to quit,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Forest minister K. Sudhakaran faces a dilemma. He has announced that if he cannot protect forests, he will not continue in the cabinet.

Things are heading for a climax as the minister''s bid to end encroachment of rain forests of the Western Ghats have met with stiff politico-bureaucratic resistance. The minister, a Congress MLA from Kannur who belongs to the Vayalar Ravi group, is weighing both options â€” whether to fight it out or quit.

The minister confronted a tricky problem last week. After the laborious removal of extensive encroachments in the Mathikettanmala Shola forests in the Idukki district, those affected regrouped and reoccupied much of the evicted land under the leadership of former education minister P.J. Joseph. Sudhakaran''s call for help from police and revenue department fell on deaf ears. The minister is learnt to have found to his dismay that forest mafias have a stronger grip over the establishment than he thought. The minister has complained to Chief Minister A.K. Antony at the cold response he received from police and revenue department.

The minister''s announcement that all those who encroached the forest land before 1977 would be evicted have sent alarm bells in the Kerala Congress parties which represent most of the encroachers from the plains. These parties have now turned against the Congress minister.

The report of Additional Chief Secretary N. Chandrasekharan Nair, who probed into the organised rape of the shola forest hills recently, has supported the forest minister''s apprehension. Of the 2,000 acres of rare shola forests annexed by avaricious people, only 100 acres have sale deeds. The remaining are all illegal occupants of the forests. The secretary has suggested that strict action be taken against encroachments or else the state would be left with virtually nothing on the hills.

The political offshoot of the encroachment has been a shared vision of the Kerala Congress parties. Of the four Kerala Congress parties (all essentially rebel congress versions) Kerala Congress (Joseph) is in the Left Front (LDF) while the other three are with the ruling Congress-led UDF.

According to indications, argument that those encroached forest land be given title deeds is a common strand running the Kerala Congress(M) and Kerala Congress(J). However, the LDF led by the CPM, has vehemently opposed encroaching forests. This has made the relationship between the KC(J) and CPM strained.

Political observers do not rule out either a crossing camp by the KC(J) or a split in the party. Nevertheless, either eventuality is not expected to solve the forest minister''s woes.

10,"Probe killing of farmers, says Cong","NEW DELHI: The Congress on Friday sought a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) inquiry into the alleged killing of eight agitating farmers in the recent Haryana police firing even as it submitted a memorandum to President K R Narayanan demanding the dismissal of Om Prakash Chautala government.

At a rally held here on Friday, senior Congress leaders Arjun Singh, Balram Jhakar, Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit, former Haryana chief minister Bhajan Lal, Haryana Pradesh Congress president Bhupinder Singh Hooda, Mohsina Kidwai and Salman Khurshid accused the state government of â€˜â€˜cheatingâ€™â€™ the people.

12,Muivah arrest warrant withdrawn,"NEW DELHI: In a major boost to the on-going peace process between the Centre and the Naga rebel groups, the state government on Friday withdrew the arrest warrant against National Socialist Council of Nagaland (Issak-Muivah) or the NSCN(I-M), faction leader Thuingaleng Muivah.

In an an official statement, the Nagaland government said: â€˜â€˜To give the peace process in Nagaland a boost and in accordance with Chief Minister S C Jamirâ€™s public statement, the government of Nagaland has formally withdrawn the arrest warrant against general secretary of NSCN(I-M) Muivah.â€™â€™

This paves the way for Muivah and NSCN(I-M) chairman Isak Chishi Swu to visit India to hold further rounds of peace talks.

The arrest warrant was issued in February 2000 following an ambush on Chief Minister S C Jamirâ€™s convoy in November 1999, in which two security personnel were killed. The government also withdrew the cash reward of Rs 10 lakh it had offered for information leading to the arrest of H S Ramsan Tangkhul alias Hangshi Tangkhul of the NSCN(I-M), suspected to be involved in the ambush.
