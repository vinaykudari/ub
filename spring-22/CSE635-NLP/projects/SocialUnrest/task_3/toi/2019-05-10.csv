0,"Union govt bid to save animals, insects","DARBHANGA: Now as per the directive of the Union ministry of statistics and programme implementation, animal welfare division, the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960 (PCA Act) would apply to the zoology department of the universities in the country in the context of the perpetration of cruelty on insects and animals and lack of sensitive and gentle handling of insects.

The zoology departments have been asked to become ""animal-friendly"" in general and ""insect and worm-friendly"" in particular.

In a recent letter addressed to all the heads of the department of zoology of the universities in the country, Veena Upadhyay, joint secretary of the Union ministry of statistics and programme implementation, animal welfare division, has directed that student should be expected to devote more time to study insects in their natural environment, as the field work of this nature was likely to yield more information about them rather than a dead and preserved animal.

""While collecting excessive insects and worms, we run the risk of destroying the habitat and mitigating the population of a species to the extent of even causing its extinction,"" the letter reads. In a specific instruction to the entomology sections of the zoology departments, the joint secretary has pointed out that in quite a few PG departments of zoology, the students of entomology were quite often expected to collect a large number of insects, their number going up to 100 or above per student, much in excess of the actual requirements of the syllabus.

In fact, there are cases where the requirements of the syllabus peg the number of insects to be collected at an unduly large level.

This is tantamount to indiscriminate and wanton killing of insects and constitutes breach of section (11)(1)(K) of the PAC Act, inviting punishment, the letter of the joint secretary reads and adds that requirements of the existing syllabus of entomology be thoroughly reviewed and reassessed and realistically worked out.

The letter further informs the HoDs that there were hundreds, if not thousands, of previous collections of animals with every zoology department. The letter asks HoDs to kindly use previously collected insects for demonstration.

2,Redevelopment plans for chawl are stayed,"MUMBAI: The Bombay high court last week stalled Shreepati groupâ€™s plans to redevelop the Raju Manaji chawls at Grant Road after 94 tenants filed a case against the builder and the housing board.

The tenants said that the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (MHADA) had given the builder permission to construct a skyscaper on the site even though it hadnâ€™t obtained the permission of the residents. In a similar case last month, tenants of Manaji Blocks, a separate building adjacent to the Raju Manaji chawls, had also got a stay from the court after MHADA allowed the Shreepati group to redevelop their three-storeyed building allegedly without their knowledge.

The builder claims that both Manaji Blocks and Manaji chawls are part of the same property. But the tenants say that while Manaji Blocks is a separate entity, the adjoining chawls had been acquired by MHADA many years ago. Now, tenants of the Manaji building and the adjacent chawls have found a common ground to fight what they claim is MHADAâ€™s move to hand over both their properties to the builder without their permission. Under the housing boardâ€™s guidelines for redeveloping such properties, the written permission of at least 70 per cent of the tenants is required before the scheme is initiated.

In the case of the Raju Manaji chawls, tenants have alleged that the builder used fraud to obtain their signatures.Their writ petition states that 217 tenants had given their signatures when they were told that the Shreepati group had become the new owner of their property. Subsequently, the tenants found out that the Shreepati group had no right, title or interest in the property as MHADA had never surrendered it to the original owner.The builder, however, claimed that he had bought and acquired the property from the original landlord, the R.H. Rathod family trust.

As a result, 90 of the 217 tenants withdrew their consent. â€œThe illegality and mala fides of the actions of MHADA can be seen from the fact that several properties located in prime locations acquired by MHADA are sought to be given to the same builder (Shreepati group). Two weeks ago, the high court passed severe strictures against MHADA vice-president Uttam Khobragade and other officers for allowing Shreepati builders to redevelop the dilapidated Pimpalwadi chawls at Girgaum. The housing board, which had acquired this property, was supposed to redevelop it and reap profits from sale of surplus tenements.

Instead, Mr Khobragade handed over the project to the Shreepati group, which would have enjoyed all the profits. The housing board would not have benefited at all. The court directed the state government to take action against Mr Khobragade. It is now learnt that Mr Khobragade has asked the government to transfer him out of MHADA. State housing secretary V.M. Lal confirmed that Mr Khobragade had asked to be relieved of his present posting.

3,Guj riots blemish on India: WB official,"MUMBAI: â€œEvery time I put myself in the place of a person residing in Gujarat, I begin to shudder,â€™â€™ World Bank vice-president (South Asia region) Mieko Nishimizu, who was on a two-day tour of Mumbai, said.

â€œIt reflects very poorly on a government when they cannot guarantee a basic premise like security of life.â€™â€™

She should know. As a girl in Osaka, Japan, she had to live with one earthquake a dayâ€”â€�almost like a vitamin pill,â€™â€™ she joked. The feeling of having lost control of oneâ€™s life could play havoc with society, Ms Nishimizu contended.

Ms Nishimizu said she sensed the same insecurity when she heard the stories of 20,000 slum-dwellers who have been displaced from their homes along Mumbaiâ€™s railway tracks. â€œNow that nearly 10,000 of them have been rehabilitated in settlement colonies in Mankhurd, one can see the difference that providing a legitimate roof over their heads has made to their lives,â€™â€™ she said.

The rehabilitation of these slum- dwellers was among the decisions set by the bank before it considered sanctioned funds for the Mumbai Urban Transport Project (MUTP)-II. The bank will take a decision in June about financing the project, which promises more trains, better roads and more buses. Visiting a community toilet block in Dharavi built under the World Bank-sponsored Slum Sanitation Programme (SSP), Ms Nishimizu said the successful implementation of such basic infrastructure projects reflected that the state government was making a sincere effort to better living conditions.

The Rs 48-crore sanitation project project envisages building 320 toilet blocksâ€”each with 40 toilet unitsâ€”in slums across the 22 civic wards. The Society for Promotion of Area Resource Centres (Sparc) is implementing the project along with the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation.

Women contractors who are building 30 per cent of the toilet projects. Ms Nishimizu said that their efforts would be duplicated in other parts of the world.

Still, Maharashtraâ€™s dire financial situation means that spending on social welfare projects is inadequate. Ms Nishimizu prescribed a bitter power bill for the burgeoning deficit. â€œMost of the stateâ€™s limited finances seem to be concentrated on bailing out the government-run electricity board, which is incurring heavy losses,â€™â€™ she said. â€œHistory has shown us that government should not be in the business of producing things. Let the private sector do that, while the government should ensure that the ordinary citizen doesnâ€™t get cheated.â€™â€™

When told that states like Orissa and Andhra Pradesh had a very bad experience privatising the power sector, she said, â€œIt is for the government to ensure that their privatisation model works.â€™â€™

4,Raichur Bar Association polls today,"RAICHUR: Three candidates have thrown their hats into the ring for the post of president of the District Bar Association for which elections are slated for May 10. The contest, at the very outset, is likely to be too close to call.The three candidates vying for the post of president -- S.G. Math, P. Narasappa and Vikram Nair -- have taken the elections very seriously with some of them viewing it as a ``prestigious issue''. Never too old or young to fight it out, they have been advocates in the district for about 25 years.S.G. Math, who was once the general secretary of the Bar Association, has been described as ``dynamic'' though a section of the Association feels that his actions do not match his words.Another contender, P. Narasappa, is known to be a committed advocate who has been struggling to ensure that rights of the Backward Class and SC and ST are restored to them. A staunch follower of Dr B.R. Ambedkar, he is known to champion the cause of the Dalits and the oppressed.The third candidate in the race for the post of president is Vikram Nair, said to be a no-nonsense advocate who calls a spade a spade.Fortunately bereft of any tinge of caste or colour, the elections for the year 2002-03 are expected to throw up a close fight. Of the 450-plus members of the Bar Association, some 360 are expected to exercise their franchise in Friday's elections.It is learnt from reliable sources that the odds favour Narasappa and Vikram Nair more than S.G. Math. But nothing could be said for sure as the invisible voter will have the final say in the battle of ballots.All quarters in the Bar Association concede that the candidates ``love the profession more than their lives''. All the three have made a name for themselves and do not take injustice lying down -- no matter who the victim is.For the post of general secretary, there are two candidates -- Rudrappa Yeligar and Venkatesh G.The following candidates were unanimously elected as members of the executive committee of the Bar Association here on Thursday: J. Parashuram Madiger, C.K. Basawaraj Nayak, N. Venkatesh, Jagan Mohan, Raj Kumar R. Chitragar, Ghouse Mohiuddin, N. Waheed Patel, P.G. Raghavendra and M. Huligeppa.

6,NRN says govt sitting on his report,"BANGALORE: Chairman and Chief Mentor of Infosys Technologies N.R. Narayana Murthy on Thursday stressed the need for transparency in public governance by citing his own experience with the central government.

Murthy, who is an advisor to the Prime Minister''s Task Force on Infrastructure and Information Technology, was speaking at a National Conference on Public Governance. ``We have submitted the report to the Centre. But till date, I have not got a single reply on the status of the report. Let them at least tell us what is the progress. The government must evolve a culture where people are encouraged, which is good governance.''''

Suggesting the need for electing only ``performing politicians,'''' Murthy urged the Election Commission (EC) to verify the track record of every politician before allowing them to contest. ``The EC must check the candidate''s performance, how many projects he/she has implemented during his tenure and the amount spent on projects. It should be peformance-based. And anyone who provides false data should be debarred from contesting elections,'''' he said.

Stating that political leaders were elected only on emotions and that no poll was fought on economic progress, Murthy said: ``Targets should be set for every project to ensure it helps the common man. And to ensure its effective implementation, there should be a minimum posting period for civil servants whose performance should also be reviewed annually.''''

Governments, he said, work more for their own survival and for employees rather than for the people. ``I have not seen a single minister or secretary standing in a queue at an airport or bus station. Why are they distancing themselves from the people they govern? Why do former ministers continue to occupy official quarters? Why is violation tolerated so much?'''' he asked.

On leadership, the Infosys chief said a good leader is one who provides a safety net for people who dare to dream. ``The task of a leader should be to identify talent, motivate and create a vision that is easy to communicate and practical,'''' he added.

Noted scientist Prof U.R. Rao said governance is not just administration. ``It involves vision, ethics and accountability. There ought to be synergy between departments while drafting public policies. Frequent transfers in government has been disastrous to good governance,'''' he pointed out.

Governor V. Ramadevi, who inaugurated the conference organised by the Bangalore Management Association (BMA), felt the Constitution should be reviewed if it is for public good. ``But we should ban enacting more laws. There are thousands of laws in our country which are not only flouted but not understood by the common man also.''''

7,No power play in city development: Buddha,"KOLKATA: Politics will not come in the way of Kolkataâ€™s development. Both Chief Minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and Kolkata mayor Subrata Mukherjee made such a resolve at a function organised in connection with the inauguration of Kolkata Panorama, a museum set up inside the historic Town Hall.

In his speech, an overwhelmed mayor expressed his gratitude to Bhattacharjee for his wholehearted support to the Kolkata Municipal Corporationâ€™s initiatives for overall development of the city.

Mukherjee said that without the state governmentâ€™s assistance, inauguration of the museum was not possible. Perhaps, the mayor was expressing his gratitude for the state governmentâ€™s approval for the waiver scheme and release of bonds to the capital markets.

â€œThe museum is a joint effort of the state government and the state government,â€� the mayor said. He sought more help from the chief minister to make the museum an internationally reputed one.

In his reply, Bhattacharjee promised more help on the state governmentâ€™s part.â€œWe will extend more help to the KMC. â€œWe are committed to work hand in hand for the development of Kolkata,â€� he remarked.

Earlier, inaugurating the museum, Bhattacharjee stressed the need to make a few changes in the museum so that the student community was attracted to it and became conscious of the history and heritage of the country.

â€œIf the students get acquainted with the history of our country,the country will be spared from many threats that the country is facing now-a-days,â€� the CM remarked.

In his speech, historian Barun De said that the civic authorities needed to add certain aspects to the museum.

According to him, the role of women in nation building activities and the co-existence of different caste, creed and religion should be incorporated to make the museum a complete one.

8,"Builders, lumpens fuelling riots: IB","NEW DELHI: The Intelligence Bureau (IB) is reported to have informed Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Union home minister L K Advani that the current spate of rioting in Gujarat is being fuelled, in part, by the builder mafia which sees the orchestration of violence as a means of getting valuable urban land vacated.

A senior IB official told The Times of India that a high-level team, which went to Gujarat, had produced a detailed report on the situation.

â€˜â€˜We have listed out a number of reasons for these riots, like the role of the builder mafia in several big cities of Gujarat who used this opportunity to get prime land cleared from the possession of the slum dwellers, or baseless rumours which triggered more violence. We have also reported the inefficient functioning of the district administration,â€™â€™ said a source.

Though independent fact-finding reports have spoken of the complicity of the ruling party, the IB has refrained from directly linking the communal violence to the BJP or the Sangh Parivar or naming any leaders.

It speaks only of the role of lumpen elements who â€˜â€˜have started claiming to be political activists of the Bajrang Dal, VHP, Shiv Sena and BJPâ€™â€™.

At the same time, however, the IB has apparently made it clear that only the state leadership can end the violence and â€˜â€˜the K P S Gill kind of policingâ€™â€™ will not help the situation.

â€˜â€˜Neither does he have that kind of power here, nor does Gujarat have any similarity with Punjab. It is impossible for the police to be present everywhere,â€™â€™ said the source.

IB sources acknowledge that the violence caught them napping. â€˜â€˜Even after the Godhra incident, the IB reports did not reflect the fact that we are going to face such large-scale riotsâ€™â€™, said a source.

9,72 days and no end in sight to Gujarat violence,"AHMEDABAD: It can be dubbed a â€˜â€˜Catch-72â€™â€™ situation for the Gujarat government which claimed to have controlled the riots within 72 hours of their outbreak.

Thursday, when the riots completed 72 days, was a moment of reckoning for an administration which neither wants to remember its 72-hour claim, nor accept that 72 days later, there is no semblance of control.

The acceptance that things are still out of control has come more from the Union government, which has appointed K P S Gill to stem the tidal wave of hatred.

The state government had decided it had done enough by deputing director-general of police K Chakravarthi to take charge of Ahmedabad. The city now accounts for more than half the 945 deaths reported officially since the Godhra carnage.

Though the government has now clammed up and refuses to part with the casualty figures, highly-placed sources in the home department say the number of the seriously injured today stands at 1,420.

Arson cases stand at 22,560 and the loss in arson at Rs 705 crore â€” not including the 4,000 vehicles damaged in the riots.

The police have their own statistics to show they have done their bit. Nearly 42,400 arrests have been made and 14,100 teargas shells and 10,500 rounds of ammunition fired â€” which has so far killed 192 rioters.

It is another issue that a community-wise break-up of the victims of police bullets shows the force in a very partisan light.

The allegation that the government and the police have not judiciously utilised the 6,200-strong Army and Central para-military forces should send a warning note to Gill, who plans to bring in more men.

Seventy-two days after the riots broke out, the BJP leadership has refused to dismiss chief minister Narendra Modi despite the mayhem in Gujarat.

This protection has been extended by Modi down the line. He has not transferred a single high-ranking home department or police officer accountable for the lapses.

The only transfers effected have been at the lower levels. This has given the impression that the officials could have kept their jobs if only they, too, had looked the other way.

Those were the initial days of the riots when it seemed like a completely one-sided affair, unlike the present situation where things look more evenly matched with every action by one community bringing in an immediate reaction from the other even in curfew-bound areas.

In an atmosphere which is so hopelessly vitiated, no amount of peace marches, peace rallies, all-religion prayer meetings and handshakes between community leaders have helped cool the frayed tempers.

And talking of control, it is not just the government and the police which have lost it.

Even those who were at the forefront of the hate campaign in the first 72 hours seem to have no control today over the mobs which just wait for an opportunity to pounce on a pedestrian, a scooterist or a cluster of houses, even as the official death toll steadily marches towards the four-figure mark.

11,IPS officers hold back fire against govt,"AHMEDABAD: Post February 28, the significance of men in khaki changed in Gujarat - whether one is referring to khaki shorts or men in khaki uniform - and this is what is troubling the state cadre of IPS officers.

At several informal meetings of the IPS, held at various fora since the Godhra carnage, the main topic of discussion is not the continuing violence or the fatigued condition of the cops but the helplessness of their fraternity against the powers that be.

On Wednesday, a few select senior officers of the IPS officers'' association met informally and reportedly decided to ""do something"" about this, but later got cold feet knowing the kind of feelers such a step could send. A senior officer who attended the get-together told TNN, ""I don''t think these things should be discussed now since it is yet to take shape"".

The idea, which has been shelved for the time being, was to send a note to the media vindicating their stance. There was also talk about drafting a memorandum to the government to protest against their image being tarnished. But with association president RN Bhattacharya being out of town, no formal document on the matter has been issued yet, although he too was present at the meet.

Incidentally, not many of the executive members of the association know about Wednesday''s meeting. ""We just wanted to straighten the records as there has been too much of adverse publicity by the media"", said a senior official.

The association, which has not held a general body meeting for the last couple of years, is shying from meeting formally because due to the continuing violence in the state, many officers would not be able to attend the meeting. The general feeling is that the good work done by the police was hardly projected by the media and only the negative aspects were highlighted.

""We are shackled by our rules of conduct and hence cannot really spell out under what constraints we worked between the political regime and the public"", says an official of DIG rank.

""The police alone should not be blamed for what has happened or is happening, there are other factors that should be looked into"", says an additional DG.

Yet, the fraternity has some brazen officers like this superintendent of police who says, ""The police is to blame for the blotch on their uniforms, they can still make amends if they begin arresting the real culprits!"" Put such questions to the rest of the police force and they just wish someone would bell the cat.

13,BJP playing vote politics: Tohra,"CHANDIGARH: Former SGPC president Gurcharan Singh Tohra has said that the BJP was playing â€˜â€˜crude vote politicsâ€™â€™ in Gujarat by allowing violence to perpetuate on a minority community.

Talking to mediapersons here on Friday he said the violence was on the similar pattern as was witnessed against the Sikhs in 1984 after Indira Gandhiâ€™s assassination.

He regretted that the NDA allies had allowed the BJP to play this sinister gameplan and had taken no drastic step to check the BJP.Tohra was particularly harsh on the Parkash Singh Badal-led Shiromani Akali Dal, which, he said, had expressed no word of criticism against the BJP.

As the SAD too represents a minority, it had a moral obligation to protect another minority in Gujarat.

Tohra said peace would not dawn in Gujarat till Narendra Modi was removed as a chief minister. He also did not see much use for KPS Gill being sent there as an adviser. Gill, he said, had already earned notoriety for committing excesses and was still facing court cases.While approving of the anticorruption drive of chief minister Amarinder Singh,Tohra cautioned him against letting corruption seep into the administration as his cabinet did not enjoy a completely clean image.

He said Amarinderâ€™s cabinet was an â€˜â€˜old wine in new bottleâ€™â€™ and he must keep a close watch on them. Many of them had a tainted past during the last Congress rule. He regretted that the Congress MLAs had not declared their assets as yet as promised in the election menifesto.Tohra came down heavily on Badal for announcing to launch an agitation against the state government allegedly for roping in the Akali leaders involved in corruption. He said Badal should have agitated on issues concerning the state and its people, not on those which were purely political.

14,"Unfazed, Garg starts probing SAD-BJP govt’s ‘misdeeds’","CHANDIGARH: Amidst raging controversies and writ petitions challenging its validity, the oneman commission of Justice AS Garg has started probing the irregularities, illegalities, corruption and other â€˜â€˜misdeedsâ€™â€™ of the Akali-BJP government during their five year tenure.

Talking to the Times News Network, Justice Garg said that to begin with he has written to all the Punjab government departments asking them to send complaints, which could be covered under the commissionâ€™s frame of reference.

Justice Garg went on to say that advertisements would be placed in newspapers inviting complaints from the public on acts of omission and commission by the previous government, which were committed for personal gain and had adversely affected the state exchequer.

On the other hand, the state government is said to have received complaints, other than the adverse newspaper reports, about the professional conduct of Justice Garg.

On being confronted by mediapersons a week ago, Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh, had given the assurance that he would â€˜â€˜look into these complaintsâ€™â€™.

But Amarinder Singh has apparently not broached the topic so far since he is said to be in Delhi with more pressing engagements at hand.

Also, some senior officers have said that they would take the matter up with the CM on his return. Officers feel that changing the commission would send wrong signals, and the best thing would be for Justice Garg to opt out on his own, saving the government from embarrassment of controversies. Some law officers in the Advocate General office added that the complaints against Justice Garg were expected to mount. This, the officials assert, would ultimately erode the credibility of the Punjab government as a crusader against corruption.

But Justice Garg is reluctant to comment on the controversies. â€˜â€˜Why should I join the issue? I canâ€™t be the judge in my own case,â€™â€™ he said, adding that he would certainly comment at an appropriate time .â€˜â€˜Then, I would respond to all what is being held against me as those cases have been decided by the Supreme Court,â€™â€™ he added.

But for the time being, he preferred to stay away from the controversy. But why then had the former Haryana chief minister opposed his elevation to the bench? To which, Justice Garg argued that he was elevated despite the opposition and even after having superseded a few district and session judges. â€˜â€˜But I wonâ€™t like to go into the details,â€™â€™ he said.

On the overlapping of the jurisdiction of the commission with that of the Lok Pal, Justice Garg skirted the issue saying that the matter was sub-judice and any comment on it would be against judicial propriety.
