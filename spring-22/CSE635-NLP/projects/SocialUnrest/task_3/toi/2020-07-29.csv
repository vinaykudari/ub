0,Govt making efforts to increase oil production: Naik,"NEW DELHI: The government said on Tuesday that efforts were on to reduce the countryâ€™s dependence on oil imports. It said that domestic production has increased by 1,010 lakh tonnes during the last two years.

Imports are down marginally, from 70 per cent of the total to 69 per cent. ""We are trying to increase production,"" said Petroleum Minister Ram Naik, ""but the gap is quite broad.""

In three years, he said, 70 contracts have been signed under the new exploration licensing policy which will make for a total of 94 blocks, against 22 in the last 10 years. There have been seven important discoveries of gas and oil, he said.

In addition, said Naik, the government has arranged oil equity from abroad. Two shipments have already come from Sudan, there is a tie-up with Vietnam. Investment for modernisation and production has gone up from Rs 20,000 crore in the 9th Plan to Rs 49,000 crore in the 10th Plan. The results are coming, he said, even as work begins on alternatives such as ethanol and a pilot project with the railways on biofuels.

1,Muslim groups call for bandh,"MUMBAI: Several Muslim organisations have called for a Mumbai bandh on Wednesday against Mondayâ€™s blast, independent of the Shiv Sena-BJP combine.

Minority dominated areas such as Bhendi Bazar, which normally defy bandhs called by the Sena-BJP, too, will not only observe a bandh this time but also enforce it, say organisations such as the Muslim Council of India, the Jogeshwari Muslim Front and the Muslim Youth of India. In fact, women and children will participate in a morcha against the blast at the Bhendi Bazar naka between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m.

Joint police commissioner (law and order) Ahmad Javed said he, too, had received faxes from Muslim organisations saying that they would be observing a bandh in their areas. However, Muslim organisations have not issued circulars or faxed letters to newspapers announcing this as they do not want to be seen as competing with the Sena-BJP.

â€œI have been visiting Muslim areas of the city all day and the mood is that the community must openly oppose anti-national forces,â€™â€™ said Munaf Hakim of the state minorities commission. The minorities cell of the Nationalist Congress Party held a demonstration condemning Pakistan-sponsored terrorism at Dadar railway station on Tuesday.

â€œWe are keen to ensure that the Sena-BJP combine does not succeed in painting the Muslims as unpatriotic,â€™â€™ said Feroze Mithiborwala of the Muslim Youth of India.

2,Many criticise call for bandh,"MUMBAI: Is a bandh the right way to protest against Mondayâ€™s bomb blasts? Representatives of various political and corporate groups said on Tuesday that the Shiv Sena-BJPâ€™s call for a bandh will not help the situation.

In fact, it may even be counterproductive, they warned. â€œA bandh will play into the hands of the perpetrators,â€™â€™ said Hussain Dalwai, a former minister and MLC of the Congress, which is part of the ruling coalition. â€œIt will fulfil their aim to divide the people, and create disturbance.â€™â€™

Ahilya Rangnekar of the Janata Dal agreed that while â€œwe must all condemn these events, a bandh is not necessaryâ€™â€™. At this time of tension, she said, it may create even more trouble.

â€œHow is a bandh going to curb terrorism? Who are we protesting against?â€™â€™ asked M.A. Khandwani, head of the State Minorities Commission. It would be better to ask citizens to be alert and cooperate with each other and the government, he said.

Not surprisingly,Mr Dalwai alleged that the bandh was a political move and had more to do with the coming elections than patriotism. Some ordinary Mumbaikars also agreed.

â€œItâ€™s just a way to show who is politically strong, who controls Mumbai,â€™â€™ said a Goregaon resident who phoned this newspaper. The bomb blast on the suburban train near Mulund in March caused many more deaths, but no party called a bandh then, this caller noted.

Civic activists were quick to point out that in 1998, the supreme court upheld a Kerala high court judgment banning general strikes or â€˜bandhsâ€™ organised by political parties and trade unions as â€œunconstitutional and illegalâ€™â€™.

B.G. Deshmukh, the former cabinet secretary and head of Action for Good Governance and Networking, wrote to the police commissioner and home minister on Tuesday to draw their attention to this fact.

â€œEnforcing a bandh can be seen as contempt of court,â€™â€™ he said. â€œMoreover, if there is any damage to property as an outcome of this, the Shiv Sena and BJP are bound to bear the compensation.â€™â€™

Meanwhile, business heads said the city will stand to lose several crores in trade as well as many precious manhours.â€�I sympathise with the families who are suffering, but a bandh is not the answer,â€™â€™ said Vijay Kalantri, the head of the All India Association of Industries. â€œBusiness and trade will take a backseat.â€™â€™ The last time Mumbai saw a bandh, in September 2002, to protest the attacks on the Swaminarayan Temple in Gujarat, the city lost an estimated Rs 130 crore in business.

Many ordinary Mumbaikars did not support the idea of a bandh for the same reason. Seema Mhatre, who runs a roadside eatery, said she would lose a dayâ€™s business, as did lawyer R.P. Mani, who is dependent on daily visitors to the metropolitan court near Azad Maidan.

However, cabbie Rakesh Dube, who stands to lose his Rs 150 daily earnings, said there had to be some gesture to protest against so many bomb blasts. Others said there should be alternative methods of expresseing protest.

Said Shailesh Haribhakti, president of the Indian Merchants Chamber, â€œWe are opposed to all work stoppages but at the same time we need to find ways to communicate to people. This should not be a question of we and them, all of us have to stake our ownership in the city.â€™â€™

More concretely, Mr Kalantri suggested a flag march, while Mr Khandwani said there should be organised citizen alertness campaigns.

â€œWe should boycott the netas who come to offer condolences to the victimsâ€™ families, and get in the way of everyone,â€™â€™ said Mr Mani, the lawyer, firmly.

3,Sena confident of enforcing bandh,"MUMBAI: Trains and BEST buses are likely to be affected by the bandh called by the Shiv Sena-BJP alliance on Wednesday to protest Mondayâ€™s bomb blast at Ghatkopar.

The Senaâ€™s executive chief Uddhav Thackeray told newspersons on Tuesday, â€œMumbaikars are familiar with Sena-sponsored bandhs.â€™â€™ Mr Thackeray and BJP leader Gopinath Munde said the bandh would begin on Tuesday midnight and end at 6 p.m. on Wednesday.

â€œIt will be peaceful and total since it has the support of the people who are outraged by not only this blast, but similar incidents in the recent past,â€™â€™ Mr Thackeray said.

He said essential services like water supply, milk distribution, ambulances and medical personnel, newspapers and electronic media as well as the fire brigade would be exempted from the bandh.No force would be used but Shiv Sainiks would â€œrequest people to make the bandh a success in their usual style,â€™â€™Mr Thackeray said.

Meanwhile, the railways and BEST have said they will run normal services on Wednesday despite the bandh call. However, Air-India and Indian Airlines have rescheduled some of their flights.

The BEST management has decided to ply its buses on Wednesday despite pressure from the Sena-BJP corporators to support the bandh.

6,Assembly clears new law on co-op societies,"NEW DELHI: The Delhi legislative assembly passed a new law on cooperative societies on Tuesday. The Bill is likely to benefit nearly 5 lakh middle class residents of the city. According to the new law, those who bought houses in societies but were not members of its governing body, are now eligible to become one.

â€˜â€˜These people had purchased houses from the original owners and had been given a general power of attorney. Their names were not in the records, and they did not enjoy the membersâ€™ rights,â€™â€™ said Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit.

All these people have to do is pay Rs 10,000 as an entry fee. â€˜â€˜The land records will now have their names as the property-owners, instead of the original members. They will have the right to vote and decide the management in these societies,â€™â€™ she said.

Development minister Haroon Yusuf, who tabled the bill, said: â€˜â€˜The new law will allow the societies to conduct annual general body meetings.â€™â€™ Elections will be held every three years now, and there is no ceiling on the number of terms which the members can remain in the executive.

8,'Help us contain crime in politics',"PATNA: Assembly members expressed concern over criminalisation of politics and vowed that the malady must end. The government appealed to MLAs to help it in implementing the N N Vohra committee recommendations for a better society.

Giving reply to the debate on Tuesday panchayati raj minister Upendra Prasad Verma asked all political parties to self-instrospect before accusing others on entry of criminals into politics. After all, why should only a member of the ruling party clamour for the release of a criminal.

The opposition would have to share the concern of the government in eliminating the disease. The Vohra committee recommendations were relevant and should be implemented in letter and spirit, Verma said adding the chair should to form an all-party panel to study it and find out ways how it could be implemented.

9,"Empower panchayats or face music, HC tells govt","PATNA: The Patna High Court on Tuesday directed the state government to allow the three-tier Panchayati Raj institutions (PRIs) to function as a local self-government according to the constitutional provisions or face the consequences.

Hearing a PIL filed by the Bihar Rajya Panchayat Parishad for allocation of 29 subjects mentioned in the 11th Schedule of the Constitution and the Bihar Panchayati Raj Act, 1993, to the PRIs with the devolution of powers/rights and funds, a division bench comprising Chief Justice (CJ) Ravi S Dhavan and Justice Shashank Kumar Singh gave two weeksâ€™ time to the state government with the warning that the time has come when the court has to order in writing that the state government is not functioning according to the constitutional provisions.

The CJ observed that the state government has been taking time again and again for devolution of powers and funds to the PRIs in accordance with the constitutional provisions, but, in fact, this has not been done till date, thus preventing the PRIs from functioning as a three-tier local self-government. On the next date of hearing the state government is supposed to submit before the court that it has handed over all the 29 subjects to the PRIs along with the powers, responsibilities and funds, the CJ clarified.

Earlier, the bench, which did not appear to be satisfied with the contents of the counter-affidavit filed by rural development department (Panchayati Raj) secretary Jayant Dasgupta, observed that the PRIs are still deprived of their rights, responsibilities and necessary funds by the state government for execution of different development schemes though it (state government) has already received funds from the Union government.

Standing counsel Alamdar Hussain, appearing for the state government, said Dasgupta clearly stated in his counter-affidavit that after the Panchayati Raj elections in April-May of the financial year 2001-02, government departments have already devolved powers and functions to the PRIs in respect of 25 of the 29 subjects mentioned in the 11th Schedule and the Act. Advocate M P Gupta, appearing for the petitioner, contended that according to the counter-affidavit filed on behalf of the state government, the â€œidentification, formulation and necessary devolution of powers/responsibilities to the PRIs regarding the subjects mentioned in the 11th Scheduleâ€� are yet to be done, but according to the Constitution those powers were given to the PRIs in 1993 itself.

Regarding the allocation of funds, Gupta said the PRIs have been allocated only those funds which the state government had received from the Union government. But no money has been allocated till date to the PRIs from the state governmentâ€™s consolidated fund by way of its own share, he added.

11,Fraud posing as LF chief's staff arrested,"KOLKATA: Sudipto Bhowmick was an audacious man. He would flaunt his ''credentials'' as a personal assistant to Left Front chairman Biman Bose, in exchange for favours, but on Tuesday his luck ran out.

The Manindra Chandra College authorities informed the anti-rowdy squad of the Kolkata Police Detective Department that they were being duped by a man posing as Kalyan Chakraborty, personal assistant to CPM politburo member Biman Bose.

â€œWe have arrested 44-year-old Sudipto Bhowmick who was pretending to be Kalyan Chakraborty. An ambassador with a metallic national emblem on its fender was also seized,â€� said deputy commissioner (DD) Soumen Mitra said.

On Tuesday, Bhowmick went to Manindra Chandra College in Shyambazar with Partho Chatterjee a cashier at an Elgin Road bank branch. Bhowmick had promised Chatterjee that he would get his daughter admitted to a good college.

Bhowmick picked up Chatterjee from the bank. On the way to Chitpore, he met another anxious father who was seeking admission for his ward.

But at the Manindra Chandra College, all was not clear.

The college authorities were already suspicious of Bhowmick as he had tried to exert his influence a number of times before.

As soon as he entered the college campus in the afternoon, the anti-rowdy squad was informed and they rushed in to arrest him.

The arrest brought an end to the bunch of complaints that the police had been receiving for the past one-and-ahalf months. It was the same grudge - a man had been introducing himself as the personal assistant to the Left Front chairman and seeking favours from different people and organisations.

â€œWhen we started investigating the case, deputy commissioner (special) Piyush Pande received a call. The caller identified himself as Anil Biswas, CPM state secretary and asked us not to pursue the case as Kalyan was â€˜theirâ€™ man,â€� Mitra added. â€œThe call in fact convinced us that it was a plain case of impersonation,â€� Mitra said.

Bhowmik used to maintain relations with a lot of people and used to flaunt his â€œconnectionsâ€� with powerful people in politics and state administration. He even said that the car that he used had been given to him by the CPM.

13,A no-nonsense leader who fought for farmers,"BANGALORE: In the early â€™90s, during the Congress regime, when tomato rates crashed, C. Byre Gowda brought a truck load of the vegetable and strewed them before Vidhana Soudha to register his protest on behalf of farmers.

In 1994, defying the Janata Dal whip, he supported V.R. Sudarshan (now a Congress MLC) in the Council elections. Along with R.L. Jalappa, D.B. Chandre Gowda and H. Ekantaiah (who were in the JD), he voted for Sudarshan, who ultimately won against the JD official candidate.

In 1996, a tough battle was on between two wrestlers as part of the historical â€œHampi festivalâ€™â€™ near Hospet. Among the spectators cheering the contestants was Byre Gowda, who was a minister then. Unable to control his excitement, he assumed the refereeâ€™s role and conducted three matches in a row.

A no-nonsense person, Byre Gowdaâ€™s candid comments and refusal to compromise with situations â€” be it political or those concerning farmers â€” earned him the wrath of the party leadership at times.

Thus, his opposition to former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda promoting his sons in politics was not taken to kindly by the latter. The disagreement between the two over the issue was irreconcilable.

A six-term legislator, Byre Gowda made his debut into the Assembly in 1972 as an Independent supported by the CPM from Vemgal in Kolar district. In 1978, he unsuccessfully contested on a Janata party ticket.

From 1983 onwards, he has been representing the constituency from one faction or the other of the Janata Parivar. His switching camps within the Janata Parivar was questioned, at no time, by his voters, who put their stamp of approval on the person than the party he represented.

Issues pertaining to rural folk were dear to him. The â€œrural weightageâ€™â€™ system was his brainchild.

Being a farmer helped him to understand farmersâ€™ issues in a better perspective. If he led a â€œtomato campaignâ€™â€™, as a minister he came to the rescue of potato growers placed in a similar situation.

When told that farmers had resorted to distress sale of potatoes, he rushed to the APMC yard, announced support price and bought the entire stock on governmentâ€™s behalf.

On another occasion, as ports and fisheries minister, he seized a paltry amount taken as bribe by a department employee. He had to be reminded by then chief secretary that there is a procedure for ministers to fight against corruption and the money recovered from raid should be duly deposited in the state treasury.

A chief ministerial aspirant among Janata Parivar leaders, Byre Gowda was not at ease in his present post as state AIPJD president. â€œThe strength he got from his constituency voters was dissipated with either his party members not cooperating with him or things not going his way,â€™â€™ a close associate of his said.

14,Arunachal: Cong tries to embarrass govt,"NEW DELHI: In a bid to embarrass the government and prove the involvement of the Naga insurgents in the political crisis of Arunachal Pradesh, the Congress Party on Tuesday released to the press copies of two letters: One written by Arunachal Chief Minister Mukut Mithi to the Prime Minister and another by party President Sonia Gandhi to the Deputy PM L K Advani.

Mithiâ€™s letter of July 14, alleges that the minister of state for home, Swami Chinmayanand had criticised the Arunachal government in a public speech for taking action against Naga insurgents.

""If reported correctly the minister of state appears to be advising the state government that no action should be taken against extortion, terror, murder and other crimes. Being the minister of state he needs no reminder that the home ministry''s orders were issued when negotiations with the NSCN were already under way, and pendency of negotiations is no license to extort and kill,"" Mithi wrote to the PM.

The Congress has been alleging that the recent political crisis that has almost unseated the Congress government in Arunachal is the result of Congress MLAs being threatened by Naga insurgents to join hands with Gegong Apang. Now, the party is releasing documents to prove that the home ministry has not been cooperating with the state government in its attempt to contain the Naga insurgents who have been active in Arunachal.

Mithi had written that, ""The minister of state needs to be reminded that his ministry has agreed to ground rules that require the insurgents to stay in designated camps in Nagaland, not to move out with arms , and not to commit crimes. The inability, or the unwillingness, to impose the ground rules is the cause of insurgency spreading to peace state of Arunachal Pradesh"".

Gandhi had written on April 22 to Advani that the centre should ""increasingly involve the democratically elected state governments of the region in all peace negotiations and aim for tripartite agreements, as was done recently in the case of Assam"".

16,Tata AIG Life gets UK govt grant,"MUMBAI: In a significant step to boost its rural insurance programme in India, Tata AIG Life Insurance Company Limited, announced the launch of ''Project Micro-Insurance'' for the landless daily-waged rural poor in Andhra Pradesh at Mumbai.

The objective of this project is to alleviate poverty through significant initiatives, including financial reforms.

In yet another first move in the Indian insurance sector, the rural insurance initiative of Tata AIG Life Insurance Company is being financially supported by the Financial Deepening Challenge Fund set up by the British Government''s Department for International Development.

In India, the Fund is currently only operational in Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. This fund, having a corpus of Â£18 million, is working in 14 countries in South Asia and Africa. To date, the Fund has committed over Â£12 million to 20 projects in 10 countries. This is the first of the eight projects sanctioned in India.

The fund provides matching financial assistance to profit oriented sound business organizations operating in the financial services sector. The objective of the fund is to encourage these organisations to design and develop innovative financial products/services for the lower strata of society who were previously denied an access to any kind of formal financial products/services.

Deloitte Haskins & Sells has been appointed to provide certain services for implementation of the Fund in India.

Tata AIG''s rural insurance initiative today culminated in signing of a contract on a matching funds basis with the Fund Managers of FDCF, Enterplan International (UK), represented in India by Deloitte, Haskins & Sells, for Micro-Insuring the lives of landless daily waged rural poor in the state of Andhra Pradesh.

As per this agreement, FDCF will be contributing Â£89,500 (approximately Rs 65 Lakhs) while Tata AIG will contribute Â£104,000 (approximately Rs 75 Lakh), thus taking the total corpus for ''Project Micro Insurance'' to Â£193,500 (approximately Rs 1.4 crore). This is in addition to ongoing initiative of spreading rural insurance in the states of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka through the strategic tie-up with The Bridge Foundation.

Speaking at the signing of the agreement between Tata AIG and FDCF, Ian J. Watts, Managing Director, Tata AIG Life Insurance Company, said, ""It is our constant endeavor to go beyond the statutory obligations for development of rural markets. We believe in the spirit of the rural mandate laid by the IRDA, instead of the content alone.""

""We believe that the benefits of insurance must be within reach of every Indian irrespective of his or her purchasing power. AIG is extremely serious about community development and rural spread in this country. The micro-insurance project reinforces our commitment to India and the rural sector in particular"" said Sunil Mehta, Country Head of Tata AIG who was present at the signing ceremony.

In reply, Garry Whitby, the Global Director of FDCF for Deloitte & Touche said ""It gives me great pleasure to represent Enterplan at the signing of the contract, as this is the first of eight projects approved in India"".

He went on to say ""The FDCF has been greeted by the main stream Financial Institutions in Africa and South Asia, as an innovative and new way of funding development projects, by nurturing partnerships between the private sector and donors to fund and establish sustainable and viable development projects which will truly deepen financial services.""

18,Govt not to adopt IPO as divestment policy,"NEW DELHI: The government has denied that it has decided to adopt the policy of issuing Initial Public Offer (IPO) for disinvestment of public sector undertakings instead of the old method of strategic sale of equity shares.

Replying to a question by Ajoy Chakraborty in the Lok Sabha on Wednesday, Law, Commerce and Industries Minister Arun Jaitley said that the government approved the disinvestment strategy as appropriate, including both strategic sale and public offer either independently or jointly depending on specific requirements of each case.

He added that the government had approved the disinvestment of Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) through a public offer of 25.2 per cent of the equity through American Depository Receipts (ADRs) and 10 per cent in the domestic market.

The disinvestment of Dredging Corporation of India Ltd (DCI) through a public offer of 20 per cent of the equity has been approved.

The government has also decided to sell its residual shareholding through the offer for sale route in five PSUs - CMC Ltd, Videsh Sanchar Nigam Ltd, IBP Ltd, Indian Petrochemicals Corporation Ltd and Bharat Aluminium Corporation Ltd - which were earlier disinvested through strategic sale.

Jaitley replied to the question by Chakraborty as Disinvestment Minister Arun Shourie is away in Montreal to attend the WTO meeting.

19,Govt top brass prefers Kumbh mela to bandh,"MUMBAI: While most Mumbaiites decided to stay home on Wednesday because of the bandh, and others discussed the loss of business and man hours, the cityâ€™s top politicians chose to leave Mumbai to make their presence felt at the Sinhastha Kumbh Mela in Nashik.

While Deputy Chief Minister Chhagan Bhujbal reached Nashik on Tuesday, Chief Minister Sushilkumar Shinde left Varsha, his official residence, at 9.15 am along with Lok Sabha Speaker Manohar Joshi in a helicopter to reach Nashik in time for the ceremony.

Joining them were Minister for Law and Judiciary Govindrao Adik, Madhukarrao Pichad and Minister of State for Home (Rural) Kripashankar Singh. In fact, Singh was the first to take the holy dip in the Godavari, even as top leaders spent a large part of the day in public meetings and other events. Surprisingly, the entire Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) top brass stayed away from the Kumbh, though the earlier programme listed the names of Pramod Mahajan, Gopinath Munde and even national party president Venkaiah Naidu.

The surprise visitor of the day was Shiv Sena leader Raj Thackeray, who performed a pooja with his wife Sharmila. As expected, the BJP lashed out against the ""absence"" of top government officials on a day when they should have instilled confidence in people terrorised by regular bomb blasts.

""The bandh call is to bring about pressure on the government to act. It is all happening because good police officers are sidelined and posts are up for sale,"" says Vinod Tawade, city BJP president.

However, Gurudas Kamat, city Congress president, plays down the issue of top leaders deserting the city on a crucial day. ""There were reports of ISI trouble in Nasik, which could have had a national impact and it was but natural for the leaders to be there,"" he says.

21,Market buoyant despite bandh,"MUMBAI: Despite a bandh called by Shiv Sena and BJP, the opposition parties in state to protest against the bomb blast at Ghatkpar, the market continued to be in a buoyant mood with the 30 share benchmark index closing 15.98 points higher at 3,780.42 points. Select heavyweight, cement and auto shares were in the limelight.

Abhijit Tare, head sales of Taib Securities said the foreign institutional investors were waiting in the sidelines. Their presence was limited to taking advantage of any erratic movements, he said.

22,Spat between minister and MLA over IPS officer,"BANGALORE: The Legislative Assembly on Wednesday witnessed a spat between transport minister B Ramanath Rai and BJP deputy floor leader D V Sadananda Gowda over an IPS officer.

Gowda, raising the issue during budget discussions, said the Dakshina Kannada SP had been transferred, but retained due to political influence. â€œIn return, he has supported the Congress by foisting fake cases on people opposed to that party,â€� he maintained.

Rai, who is the district in-charge minister for Dakshina Kannada, immediately got to his feet.

â€œI swear in the name of Dharmasthala Manjunatha, who is the god I believe in, that this is not true. We have not asked the SP to do our bidding and it is an insult to the officer, who has an impeccable track record,â€� he declared.

At this, Gowda, supported by opposition leader Jagadish Shettar, said: â€œNobody mentioned you by name. Why are you reacting?''â€�

Yogish Bhat (BJP) poured more fuel into the fire by contending: â€œIn Dakshina Kannada, no lower level policeman has been transferred without favours for the last 15 years!â€�

A distressed Rai continued to swear in the name of god that he had nothing to do with any of this, even as Speaker M V Venkatappa asked Gowda to go onto a different subject.

23,Green flutters with saffron on bandh day,"MUMBAI: The Shiv Senaâ€™s saffron flags fluttered alongside the green banners of several Muslim organisations at a dharna in the minority-dominated Bhendi Bazaar area on Wednesday. Condemning Mondayâ€™s Ghatkopar bus blast as an â€œact of cowardiceâ€™â€™, the gathering pledged to work together to ensure peace in the city.

Donning black head-bands, about a hundred Muslims gathered near the Bhendi Bazaar police chowky to express their support for the bandh called by the Sena-BJP combine. Their claim was buttressed by the fact that most shops, barring a few chemistsâ€™ shops, small restaurants and hawkersâ€™ stalls in the area, remained closed throughout the day.

Protestors also burned an effigy of a terrorist to drive home their point. Summing up Mondayâ€™s bomb blast as an attempt to create a rift between Hindus and Muslims, Muslim Council president Ibrahim Tai said, â€œIn Kashmir, terrorists kill people to achieve their goal of capturing the Valley. Here, the terroristsâ€™ acts have no motive to achieve except to create communal discord.â€™â€™

Thanking the Muslim organisations for supporting the bandh, Bala Nandgaonkar, Sena MLA from nearby Mazgaon, said, â€œTerrorists and bombs donâ€™t differentiate between Hindus and Muslims. The only way to combat them effectively is to join hands and fight.â€™â€™ He said the support for the bandh was a clear indication that the minorities did not perceive the Shiv Sena as anti-Muslim. â€œWe have to fight those against the country,â€™â€™ he said. Several other Sainiks also participated in the dharna. The Senaâ€™s presence at the dharna did lead to hushed exchanges at the gathering.

Members of the Muslim Mahila Mandal join in a dharna organised by different Muslim bodies at Bhendi Bazaar on Wednesday to condemn the Ghatkopar bomb blast.
