1,Three murder suspects arrested after Mangolpuri shootout,"NEW DELHI: Delhi Police has claimed to have arrested three inter-state gangsters accused of murder and attempt to murder. The accused were apprehended near Mangolpuri after an exchange of fire, claimed the police. Nobody was injured in the shootout, said the police.

The alleged accused have been identified as Satish Kumar, Satender and Ravinder. The police claimed to have recovered a pistol and two locally-made revolvers from the accused. Eight cartridges, including four lives ones, were also allegedly recovered from the accusedâ€™s possession.

The police claimed the accused were arrested while they were planning the escape of an undertrial, Mainpal of Anoop gang, from Tihar jail. Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP) special cell Ashok Chand said: â€˜â€˜On Sunday, the police received information that the accused would be hiding in a house in Mangolpur Kalan.â€™â€™

The special team led by Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP) Rajbir Singh raided the premises. The police claimed Kumar had fired two shots at the police party. â€˜â€˜Later, the police also fired back,â€™â€™ Chand said.

Kumar allegedly told the police he had started his criminal career in 1997 in Haryana. â€˜â€˜He stole a motorcycle then. He later graduated to murder,â€™â€™ Chand added.

The police said he was also accused of murdering a person in Najafgarh on July 26. â€˜â€˜Ashok was a victim of rivalry between his brother Rajesh and a person called Pradeep Sharma. Sharma hired Kumar to kill Ashok,â€™â€™ Chand said.

2,Consolidated maritime law will have more teeth,"MUMBAI: For the first time in international maritime history, the International Labour Organisation (ILO) will soon consolidate 60 maritime laws into one simple law. This law will incorporate existing standards of competency and training for seafarers and merchant navy officers so that uniform standards can be maintained in all maritime states.

The new law will have much more teeth than existing ILO rules because it will lay down a clear enforcement machinery for those violating its provisions, according to shipping industry sources. This new law will increase the accountability of substandard ships. It also puts part of the blame on flag states â€” maritime nations which register vessels. For instance, the law can now book Flag of Convenience (FoC), a term for countries such as Panama and Lithuania which allow ship owners to register badly-maintained vessels called â€œrust bucketsâ€™â€™ to earn registration revenue.

The new law will also bring within its ambit classification societies, which categorise ships according to maritime specifications. â€œFoCs, classification societies and ship owners will all be made accountable in case ships are detained or they sink because of poor safety systems on board,â€™â€™ a former official from the Mercantile Marine Department (MMD) elaborated.

Apart from simplifying existing rules and guidelines, this law seeks to iron out unequal treatment of ship owners by maritime states. Representatives from India and their counterparts in other maritime states have agreed that there should be â€œno more favourable treatment to ship owners just to attract revenue.â€™â€™ The new law will also protect port nations, and thereby safeguard their own vessels. They can take stringent action against ships which discharge ballast water or bunker oil along coastal waters of the port state.

Discharging ballast water from one ocean zone to another results in exchanging a large group of microorganisms to an area where they do not exist, resulting in diseases. Large ships which are empty have to fill their tanks with ballast water so that their propellers get submerged and they are able to get greater motive power. Earlier, they would discharge this ballast water along the ports which they visited. This has even changed the complexion of the water along the Mumbai coast, according to research findings.

6,Irked: CPI tells ‘defectors’ to seek re-election,"CHANDIGARH: The CPI has asked its former two MLAs, Nathu Ram and Harbant Singh, to quit their Vidhan Sabha seats that they had won as CPI candidates and seek re-election even as it has condemend its election ally, the Congress, for engineering their defection to the Congress. Nathu Ram represents Malout Assembly seat whereas Harbant Singh was elected from Budlada seat.

The partyâ€™s state executive, at its meeting here on Sunday, took stock of the situation arising out of the defection of its only two representatives in the state Assembly to the Congress last week. It asked them to quit their Assembly seats and face their re-election as the Congress candidates.

The meeting presided over by state secretary Joginder Dayal deplored the manner in which the Congress â€˜â€˜luredâ€™â€™ the two MLAs to its fold and at the same time wondered why did such defection take place in an ideologically committed party that the CPI is.

Undertaking a damagecontrol exercise Dayal said the CPI drew some lessons for itself and was undergoing the process of introspection.

He said the party proposed to start an ideological campaign to reaffirm the party leadersâ€™ commitment to all that the CPI stands for. Perturbed over the development the party executive called upon the rank and file not to get disheartened or disillusioned with it.

Dayal also took exception to some anti-party statements made by few CPI leaders in the wake of the defection of the two MLAs and asked them to observe discipline.

The leaders had condemned Dayal for providing lopsided leadership to the state CPI which, they alleged, had bred resentment among party leaders and found expression in the defection of two MLAs.

7,New BSEB rules to check power theft,"PATNA: The BSEB has evolved a new set of rules to check theft and pilferage of power from its network. It has defined a power thief as follows:

A consumer uses electricity from the BSEBâ€™s system when he is not a consumer of the board; uses electricity through any artificial means not authorised by the board; tampers with the meter or its seal or apparatus or circuits; manipulates or obstructs or interferes in the functioning of such meter in any manner so as to prevent it from fully/partially/ or correctly registering the energy consumed; unauthorisedly draws from the BSEBâ€™s system when his premises is disconnected; manipulates change of phase of electric supply lines or uses own earthing system.

If the consumer has committed, or is engaged in the commission of any act of malpractice or theft or pilferage, BSEB officials at any time can enter the premises and check the meter, its seals, apparatus, circuits or installation through which energy is supplied or is being consumed, used or drawn.

The BSEB, in its recent decision to check malpractice or theft/pilferage of energy, has decided that if any consumer obstructs or prevents in any manner board officials from entering his premises, the officials may cause the supply to be disconnected after giving 24 hours notice.

If, prima facie, any kind of malpractice or pilferage is revealed on such inspection, the board officials or the inspection team will collect materials as evidence of such act, and will prepare a memorandum of such inspection with details of material evidence, the date, time, name of witnesses and fact of entry and inspection.

The BSEB official concerned will also obtain signature of the consumer or his representative and hand over a copy of the said memorandum of inspection to the consumer. In case of refusal to accept it by the consumer, the same will be pasted on the premises in the presence of two witnesses and this would be deemed to be sufficient service of such copy to such consumer. A copy of memorandum will also be sent to the consumer by registered post.

The inspection of the meter reader for recording power consumption will not take place in case of such erring consumers till the final settlement is made. For various acts of malpractices, the compensation payable by a consumer to the board will be assessed without prejudice to the right of the board to disconnect the supply.

When use of electricity supplied under lower tariff is made for a purpose for which a higher tariff is in force, the assessment of compensation will be as follows:

(A) For the entire period of malpractice, the consumer will be charged at twice the existing rate under the higher tariff less already charged. In case such period cannot be established/ ascertained, six monthsâ€™ period prior to detection of such malpractice will be taken into account.

(B) Apart from penalty bill as per provisions, the consumer will have to enter into a new agreement for higher tariff. Till compliance, he will be billed on the basis of higher tariff for the entire premises. The board has also decided that the energy bills exceeding Rs 10,000 of all private consumers in all categories will have to be paid either in cash or through bank drafts.

However, the cost of commission payable to the bank on issue of such bank drafts will be borne by the board at the rate of Rs 2 per thousand of rupees or fraction thereof.

Lastly, the consumers seeking enhancement or reduction of sanctioned power load will have to submit an application in the prescribed form along with the requisite fee at least three months in advance to the board.

9,CM hints at less power for farmers,"HYDERABAD: Chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu says he is looking at a grim power situation and things could get worse.

Interacting with the public at a Dial-Your-CM programme on Monday, he hinted at a cut in supply to the farm sector from nine hours to eight.

In fact, with the power department seeing no signs of the crisis ending early, it is now preparing for the long haul. Apprehending a severe shortage during the ensuing rabi season, it is working on an action plan with the agriculture department to keep farmers away from cultivating paddy, for it is a water-intensive crop.

More electricity would be needed to run motors to water the fields.

At the interactive session, titled â€œPower services â€” improved servicesâ€�, the chief minister said field staff would be instructed to cut supply â€” if needed â€” from nine hours to eight or eightand-a-half hours. This would depend on the local conditions.

Naiduâ€™s statement came after a participant from Ongole complained that though the government had promised nine hours of supply in two phases, the feeds were in five or six phases. â€œInstead, letâ€™s have eight hours of supply in two phases, each lasting four hours,â€� he suggested. The CM urged the public to appreciate the enormity of the problem and said his government was doing everything to ensure the safety of the standing crop.

Indeed, Transco and other power utilities have been stretching themselves to the limit to ensure that the standing crop does not wilt. But paddy being a firm favourite for rabi too, Transco bosses are aware that the going for them would only get tougher.

So, they have initiated moves to ask the agriculture department to intervene and avert a collapse. For, it could be a steep ask expecting the power utilities to keep the supply schedule to the fields going then. â€œIf farmers plant paddy during rabi, they will need power to run their pumps. It has not rained and the drought situation is bad, it will only get worse over time. The only source of water in these circumstances is ground water and one needs pump sets to water the fields. It would be virtually impossible for us to feed the agricultural as well as other sectors,â€� a Transco official said.

The agriculture department, though, is wary of issuing any such advisory, as paddy farming is a sensitive issue and has important political ramifications.

But for Transco, it is a hand-to-mouth situation now. It is struggling to supply 140 million units a day and is cutting down on the demand for another 9 million units through power cuts.

Now, if paddy were to be cultivated in the next season, the daily demand would zoom to 16 million units â€” an impossible target to meet. Even under ideal conditions, with all its hydel plants going full steam and with the back-up of central sector supply, Transco can supply about 150 million units a day.

11,Prime suspect in Godhra case arrested,"VADODARA: The Gujarat police achieved a major breakthrough in the Godhra train massacre case when a key suspect Abdul Razzak Mohammed ''Kurkur'' was arrested late on Monday by the team investigating the Sabarmati Express incident of February 27.

Though police refused to give further details, it is believed that Kurkur surrendered himself after being on the run for over seven months.

Kurkur, a prominent hotelier of Singal Falia, is believed to be one of the prime conspirators of the massacre that left 59 people dead and police had been on the look-out for him ever since.

Police officials said they had evidence from various witnesses which corroborates the fact that the fuel used for burning the S-6 compartment was obtained from a building owned by Kurkur.

Though several politicians, including the former municipality chief Mohammed Kalota and corporator Haji Bilal, had also been arrested immediately after the incident, police believes that it was Kurkur who had played a key role in hatching the conspiracy to attack the train.

Kurkur runs the Aman Guest House in Singal Falia and also has a network of vendors at the railway station for supply of food-stuff. Police officials said he was engaged in faking popular soft-drink brands and was also a supplier of building material.

One of the more affluent inhabitants of Singal Falia, Kurkur, who is in his mid-forties, had a stranglehold over the area in and around the railway station because of his clout.

""He was the missing link so far, he is the person who can throw light on the entire episode. Kurkur had played a key role in the conspiracy and will help us piece together the entire sequence of events. He was also the person who instigated the mob that burnt the coach,"" an official said.

Government Railway Police superintendent J K Bhatt confirmed that Kurkur had been arrested. He, however, said that further details regarding his arrest would be disclosed at a later stage.

13,"Naik keen to meet George, Joshi over disinvestment","NEW DELHI: Petroleum Minister Ram Naik on Tuesday expressed a wish to meet like-minded hardliners on disinvestment in the Cabinet, George Fernandes and Murli Manohar Joshi, to discuss the issue before Prime Vajpayee''s return from abroad.

""I am definitely keen on meeting George and Murli Manohar Joshi before the Prime Minister returns from abroad"", Naik told reporters here.

Asked about his opposition to privatisation of Hindustan Petroleum Corporation (HPCL) and Bharat Petroleum Corporation (BPCL), Naik said: ""The issue was being discussed and would be decided by Vajpayee, L K Advani and Fernandes"".

""They are seized of the matter"", he said, adding that the matter would be decided as soon as the Prime Minister calls a meeting.

Naik, however, said there was no meeting scheduled for the purpose.

He said he had tried to contact Fernandes on Monday but was unsuccessful as the Defence Minister had returned late in the night from an overseas visit.

""I tried contacting him yesterday but I was told he returned very late in the night,"" he said adding that he would continue to make efforts to meet him.

On the issue of whether privatisation of two oil majors would lead to creation of monopolies, he declined to comment saying ""it was not worth commenting on"". Asked whether he favoured the idea of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) and others joining in the bid for the two oil majors as junior partners, Naik refused to be drawn in saying ""I am not going to react to the formula as nothing has come to me"".

""No one has told me about it. Unless a proper proposal is put up by the disinvestment department it is premature to comment.

""I have read in the newspapers about this but I have no official information,"" he added.

On the issue of establsihing the Bina refinery, he said the Prime Minister''s assurance would be honoured.

Naik said any US attack on Iraq would benefit speculators who would jack up prices and create difficulties for common man.

He also said he would be meeting Finance Minister Jaswant Singh on the issue of fiscal trigger for cushioning against the impact of volatility in oil prices.

15,Padyatra a modern programme of modern farmer: Gowda,"BANGALORE: Dubbing Chief Minister S.M. Krishna''s padyatra a ``modern programme of a modern farmer'''' (Vinoothana Raithana Vinoothana Karyakrama), former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda on Tuesday announced ``awareness programmes'''' in the assembly constituencies of Cauvery region from October 10 to 13 to counter the CM''s peace march.

Gowda told reporters the awareness programmes will inform people about the Congress government''s failure and also the efforts of the previous Janata Dal governments to resolve the Cauvery crisis. The programme will begin from Bhagamandala, birth place of Cauvery in Kodagu.

Gowda also announced that he would write a book on the Cauvery issue. The book will include the history of the Cauvery dispute and the efforts/failures of successive governments.

Blaming the state government for the present imbroglio, Gowda said Krishna decided to go on a padyatra to cover up the government''s mistakes. There was no need for a padyatra for peace as the opposition is supporting the government completely.

``The government adopted a dual stand in agreeing to the Cauvery River Authority''s decision in New Delhi and defying it in Bangalore. I am not prepared to find fault with Prime Minister A.B. Vajpayee on this issue as he has done everything possible to solve the problem,'''' he said.

Reiterating the need for an expert committee to study the crop pattern and availability of water, similar to the one constituted in 1995, Gowda said: ``I wrote letters on September 3, 7 and 20 to the PM and met him to thrash out a solution. But the government''s dual stand only precipitated the issue,'''' he said.

Gowda appealed to the Supreme Court, PM and CRA not to punish people of the state for ``the mistake of one person''''. ``Karnataka has always been a law abiding state and we have achieved national repute for this. No one should have the impression that we defy law,'''' he maintained.

Asked if the present crisis would lead to a mid-term election, Gowda did not give a direct reply but said: ``Why should MLAs suffer because of the mistake of one person?''''

16,Hubli under curfew after communal clash,"HUBLI: Two persons were stabbed, one fatally, in Old Hubli area on Tuesday afternoon and a like number injured in police firing. An indefinite curfew has been clamped in Hubli city following the incidents.

A person identified as Santosh succumbed to the injuries he suffered in a stabbing incident, the police said. Another person was stabbed at Mullah Oni in the Kamaripet area. He was shifted to the KIMS Hospital, where his condition was said to be critical.

Five persons were injured in stone-throwing in Old Hubli. A mob resorted to arson around 2 pm on Tuesday. The police have arrested 25 persons.

The trouble began late on Monday night when a person belonging to one community assaulted a youth from another community after a petty quarrel. After the police took the attacker to the police station, a group of miscreants threw stones at them. Meanwhile, another group, supporting the victim, joined the fray.

As the situation threatened to get out of control, the police lobbed tear gas shells. When this failed to disperse the mob, the police fired seven rounds in the air. When the unruly rioters did not heed the warning, the police fired at them, grievously injuring Savitha Bai (40) and Rathan (19), who were watching the goings-on from outside their residence.

17,Govt for disinvestment of shipyards,"KOCHI: The Union shipping ministry is in favour of disinvestment of shipyards to make them more competitive and is on the look out for tie-ups with more experienced yards to achieve goals in ship building, Shipping Minister Ved Prakash Goyal said on Tuesday.

18,MDs transferred for resisting political pressure,"GANDHINAGAR: There seems to be a common reason behind the transfers of Vilasini Ramanchandran of the Gujarat Mineral Development Corporation, Rajiv Takru of the Gujarat Urban Development Company and J S Rana of the Gujarat State Road Transport Corporation.

It is a mystery to some on why just six months after their appointments, these three senior bureaucrats, all managing directors of major state-run corporations, should get transferred. It now appears that all three of them were shunted out because they refused to toe the political line.

In the case Takru, BJP treasurer Surendra Patel reportedly took personal interest. The man brought in, R M Patel, as new GUDC MD, is considered close to some top ministers. The other two, Ramachandran and Rana, were sidelined to insignificant posts as they refused to award contracts to parties desired by the BJP rulers, setting aside the norms of transparent tendering by calling in competitive bids. Rana went a step further - he refused state buses on concessional rate to the BJP''s Gaurav Yatra.

The immediate reason of Ramachandran''s transfer may be a stormy GMDC board meeting on September 24, where she did not agree to give the contract for a Kutch bauxite project to a particular contractor. GMDC chairman Mukesh Zaveri, a political appointee who is close to the CM, wanted the contract to go to a contractor from Jamnagar. But that was just the pretext for her being sidelined. Known in the bureaucracy for being tough and straightforward, Ramachandran was proving to be a hard a nut to crack.

She even objected to a large number decisions taken for political reasons before she had joined in April. Especially the payment by GMDC of ''advertorials'' to a leading English weekly praising the Narendra Modi government. These two ''advertorials'' cost the GMDC Rs 32 lakh and 51 lakh, respectively.

As MD she took independent decisions, overlooking Zaveri. She even conveyed to the CM''s office that corporations should not be told to pay for Chief Minister Narendra Modi''s political campaigns through ads.

Politicians know only too well that only few profit-making state PSUs are left with the capacity to award big contracts. The old ones that can be ""milched"" for poll purposes are GMDC, Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation, Gujarat Maritime Board, and Gujarat Water Supply and Sewerage Board. And new ones attract foreign aid: The GUDC, with a Rs 540-crore project to rebuild four quake-affected Kutch cities, is one such lucrative PSU for the politicians. Unpliable, Takru was indeed found unfit for it.

As for the GSRTC, though loss-making, it still enjoys popularity among politicians. Rana, who headed it, refused to give a contract to a particular party and even protested to the CMO against political pressure for hiring buses for the Gaurav Yatra, saying it ""harmed the GSRTC''s cause.""

19,Rush for tickets makes Congress upbeat about polls,"AHMEDABAD: Try telling the state Congress that the Akshardham attack would only benefit the BJP and they wouldn''t buy it.

In a recent campaign to chart out a tentative list of nominations for the Assembly elections, the party leaders were pleasantly surprised to find that the maximum number of applications came from the constituencies that have been hitherto dominated by the BJP.

Sample this: For the single constituency of Jotana in Mehsana district, there are 39 applicants, while the contestants for Sarkhej assembly constituency are pegged at 18. Jotana (SC) is now represented by the BJP MLA Ishwarbhai Makwana, a minister in Modi''s regime and so is Sarkhej, represented by another Modi-loyalist Amit Shah. ""From the 58 constituencies of Saurashtra, which have always been dominated by the BJP, we received some 570 applications,"" says Gaurav Pandya who managed this campaign for the party.

For the Congress, these are bright signs and only indicate that the contest may not be as one-sided as it seemed. ""Obviously, they are confident and the Congress nominees are looking at the atmosphere prevailing in their areas which has instilled this confidence,"" says Sabarkantha MP Madhusudan Mistry.

During the campaign that concluded in the last week of September, there were some 1,700 applications received, against a fee through which the party roped in Rs 71 lakh for its own coffers.

The fees were in the category of Rs 5,000 for the general seats and Rs 2,500 for the seats reserved for SC and ST. ""There were many candidates who filed applications for more than one seat, but we accepted fees for only one of the seats,"" says a Congress office-bearer.

Thus, there were 211 applications for the 13 seats reserved for SC and 159 for the 26 seats reserved for ST. In North Gujarat, there were 600 applications for 53 seats, many for Ahmedabad - a predominantly BJP area, while 230 candidates applied for the 42 constituencies of central Gujarat and 270 for the 29 seats of South Gujarat.

The other positive aspect is that ""all the candidates are below 60 years of age, except the veterans whose winnability has already been tested"", said an office-bearer.

20,"10 pm deadline onslaught on Gujarati culture, say organisers","SURAT: If Chief Minister Narendra Modi is so concerned about the ''ashmita'' of Gujarat, then the ban on the use of loudspeakers after 10 pm at garba venues during Navratri is nothing but an onslaught on Gujarati culture, said many in Navratri Hitrakshak Samiti.

The Samiti was formed to safeguard people''s faith in the wake of restrictions imposed on Navratri festivities by the state home department in view of threat perceptions after the terrorist attack on the Akshardham temple in Gandhinagar.

Taking a dig at the guidelines in the name of security measures, Samiti members said on Monday that Modi makes tall claims of being instrumental in keeping Gujarati culture intact during the course of his Gaurav Yatra.

""By imposing curbs on one of the most revered festivals in the state, Modi''s government has failed to protect religious expression of the people, said Manoj Shinde of Rangeela Group, which has been organising garba near New Bridge at Adajan for the last 10 years.

He said that if garba could be held on foreign soil like in London even beyond midnight, then why not in our own land. If the state machinery could not provide basic security measures, it is the failure of the government. The public should not be made to suffer for this.

In a commercial hub like Surat, business hours stretch beyond 9 pm and banning the use of loudspeakers after 10 pm would mean no Navratri celebration at all, said Vipul Patel, a garba organiser.

Many of those who attended the Samiti''s meeting on Monday said that the noise level as prescribed under the Act would be maintained, but looking at the festive occasion, a complete ban on the use of loudspeakers after 10 pm would not be feasible.

Police commissioner V K Gupta said that police officials manning the garba venues would decide whether there was any violation of the rules under the prescribed Act. However, sources said that police officials would handle the situation in a ""not-so-strict"" manner and things would be allowed to go on smoothly, subject to certain limits in noise level, among others.

Nitin Talati of Harvik Enterprises, which is organising garba at the Indoor Stadium here, told TNN that restrictions on the use of loudspeakers would not be applicable in their case as the festivities would be held in a closed environment.

However, security measures like frisking women visitors would remain a problem with the dearth of women security guards in the city, said an official on the condition of anonymity.
