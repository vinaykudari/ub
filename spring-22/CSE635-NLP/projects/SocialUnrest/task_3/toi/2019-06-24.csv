0,Prawn farmers plagued with diseases,"KOLKATA: Recent investigations, carried out by scientists of Central Inland Capture Fisheries Research Institute, Barrackpore, in the Sunderbans have revealed that a large section of the population, engaged in collection prawn and fish seeds regularly fall victim to diseases like heart and stomach disorder,diabetes, tuberculosis, asthma and even leprosy.

The scientists observed that about 4,00,000 people were engaged in the profession of collecting fingerlings, tiny larvae and prawn seeds from the estuarine creeks, canals and thick mangrove foliage of Sunderbans.

During the collection of seed, men, women and children remain in waist-deep water for over 12 hours a day and eventually fall victim to the diseases.

The scientists have recommended that welfare programmes should immediately be launched for the benefit of the downtrodden people of Sunderbans with an objective to prevent the spread of these diseases.

1,KMC to complain against lawyers,"KOLKATA: The Kolkata Municipal Corporation authorities have decided to complain to the Bar Council about the activities of a section of municipal tribunal lawyers.

Highly placed KMC sources told TNN that these lawyers were indulging in malpractices, seriously affecting the work of the municipal assessment tribunal.

Recently, at least three cases have come to the notice of the civic authorities where forged `no-outstanding certificatesâ€™ have been submitted to the tribunal.

The certificates are mandatory under section 189 of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation Act, 1980, in order to put forth an appeal before the tribunal regarding valuation of property.

Some property owners who have large amounts outstanding in taxes, however, have been found to be producing the NOCs and going ahead with their appeals. This is causing considerable loss of revenue to the KMC.

Suspecting foul play, the authorities have conducted inquiries and found a number of NOCs to be forged.

â€œWe currently have at least three cases before us,â€� disclosed a senior official, alleging that the â€œpartiesâ€� obtain these fake documents through their lawyers.

Municipal Assessment Tribunal Bar Association secretary Jayanta Kumar Mukherjee, however, told TNN that lawyers had nothing to do with the irregularities.

â€œThe KMC issues the certificates and if these are forged, the employees concerned should be held responsible,â€� he said.

While an official admitted that collusion of the civic staff could not be ruled out, he said there was enough ground to move against some lawyers and said the decision was approved from the top.

3,Minister-mayor clash over city flyover,"KOLKATA: Even before it is born, the Rs 60-crore Vivekananda Road flyover is a subject of controversy between West Bengal transport minister Subhas Chakraborty and Kolkata mayor Subrata Mukherjee.

In a pre-construction ceremony in north Kolkata on Sunday, Chakraborty said: â€œThis flyover will be built. None can stop it. There is an administration with mandate for over a quarter century. If the mayor questions technicalities of the flyover, we are ready sit with him to clear misgivings. But if his opposition is political, I canâ€™t help it. No one has the right to block the greater interest of the people.â€�

Mukherjee, who boycotted the ceremony, shot back: â€œThe flyover is illegal. The road belongs to Kolkata Municipal Corporation. Neither the construction agency nor the transport department took permission from KMC.â€�

While Chakraborty claimed necessary permission had been obtained from KMC, Kolkata Port Trust and Kolkata Police, the mayor said there was no tripartite agreement between KMC, the private party which would build the flyover and the transport department.

â€œThere is a law of the land. If a minister defies it, the law will take care of him. I have no political objection to the development of the city.KMC will fight it legally,â€� he added.

The mayor said he has written to the CM recording his objections. He was peeved that the transport department planned to collect a toll on the flyover and said constructions were not allowed during monsoon because of waterlogging.

Chakraborty said the transport department was also considering the construction of a corridor linking the flyovers to form ring-road for uninterrupted traffic-flow.

Traders of Mecchua, the retail fruit-market, had agreed to shift their business to Kona where the truck terminus is being built.

The 2.5 km flyover will be constructed on build-operatetransfer basis in two years by Vivekananda Skyroad, a consortium of Shristi-Cleveland Group in the UK.

Tolls from users, commercial utilisation of the space below the flyover and advertisements would make the project commercially viable, he said.

4,CM not to brush aside quota policy,"LUCKNOW: The new reservation policy decision of the Mayawati government may have attracted flak from the BJP leaders, but they are in no position to brush it aside.

The deft handling of the issue by the government coupled with BJP leadersâ€™ inability to take on the chief minister has paved the way for the slow but sure implementation of the new quota policy of the government.

In the meantime, with regard to the reservation policy adopted by the Uttar Pradesh government on May, 2001, the government counsel has sought time from the Supreme Court.

At the same time, Dayaram Pal, a former BSP leader who of late has become a critic of chief minister Mayawati, filed a case against the governmentâ€™s latest reservation directives, seeking restoration of the reservation policy adopted by the government in 2001 by the then chief ministr Rajnath Singh.

When the BSP-BJP government assumed the reins of the state on May 3, chief minister Mayawati announced at her press conference that she would not unnecessarily alter decisions of her predecessor. She, however, hinted that she would not mind taking a look into such decisions that had proved to be a burden on the state exchequer.

But, in less than a month, the chief minister had to come up with a new quota policy which, in essence, was based on the original ordinance of 1994, restoring 27 per cent jobs to the OBCs. Simultaneously, the reservation policy also discarded the concept to â€˜ati-pichdaâ€™ and â€˜ati-dalitâ€™ concept of reservation.

The decision attracted severe criticism from various quarters for it completely altered the concept of reservation-within-reservation introduced by previous chief minister Rajnath Singh.

Interestingly, leaders who scripted the â€˜quota-within-quotaâ€™ policy for the BJP government made a somersault and supported the new policy brought by the chief minister on May 31 .

Taking advantage of the wavering stand of the BJP leaders, the chief minister had told newsmen that she had talked to the BJP ministers who fully supported her policy in this regard. Though the May 31 reservation directives virtually negated the BJP quota policy, no minister from the BJP had raised any voice of dissent in this matter.

Even Rajnath Singh has not openly opposed it, though he still believed his concept of reservation was the ideal for Uttar Pradesh.

These interplay of legal provisions would virtually make the opponents of the governmentâ€™s reservation directives to wait for the apex courtâ€™s verdict in this case, which might take more than the required time, said an official of the government.

5,Congmen rally behind Speaker,"PATNA: Sinking its internal differences, the entire state Congress has closed ranks to rally round Bihar assembly Speaker Sadanand Singh against whom a woman in Bhagalpur filed a rape case in court.

The Speaker, while issuing a statement expressing his pain and anguish over the case in a press conference at his residence on Sunday, named former CPI MLA Ambika Prasad and Ajay Mandal, who had contested unsuccessfully in the assembly polls from Kahalgaon, as the persons allegedly â€œbehind the fabricated caseâ€�.

â€œThe womanâ€™s husband was identified as the main culprit in the kidnapping of my kin Sagar. The false rape case was lodged a day after the police arrested him,â€� stressed the Speaker.

As a mark of solidarity, BPCC chief Shakeel Ahmad, CLP chief Vijay Shankar Dubey, ministers Ashok Ram and Vishwamohan Sharma, senior Congress leaders Radhanandan Jha, Lahtan Choudhary and Ramashray Prasad Singh were also present at the press conference. Reacting to a question regarding the alleged involvement of Congress leaders in the lodging of the rape case, the Speaker said he refuses to believe that any of his party leaders was behind this.

However, Ahmad maintained that some party leaders dragged his name just to boast of their closeness with Sadanand. â€œThese leaders are sitting here even now,â€� he remarked apparently referring to Prem Chandra Mishra who had alleged that the BPCC chief was behind the â€œfabricated caseâ€� against the Speaker. The brief tension was defused by the Speakerâ€™s intervention.

Reading out his short statement, the Speaker said he never imagined that this kind of charge would be levelled against him even though his name had been dragged in quite a few controversies in Bhagalpur in recent times.

7,Junior NTR steers clear of politics,"GUNTUR: The suspense over Junior NTR â€” the latest sensation of the Telugu film world â€” ended with the actor not uttering even a word about politics during his visit to the district on Sunday.

However, he claimed that he is the real scion of his grandfather and all-time great in the Telugu film world Nandamuri Taraka Rama Rao. Jr NTR unveiled a statue of his grandfather N T Rama Rao here on Sunday.

As expected, a majority of TD leaders including ministers Kodela Sivaprasad Rao and J R Pushparaj and district party chief Yadlapati Venkata Rao kept away from the programme. Vinukonda, otherwise a sleepy town, was witness to hectic activity on Sunday, as people came in thousands to catch a glimpse of actor. Almost all the streets in the town were packed with people from the surrounding villages.

People continued to pour in till the actor left the town in the afternoon. His address at the public meeting was very brief and the disappointed gathering demanded that he speak for some more time. The local Telugu Desam legislator V Yallamanda Rao, presiding over the meeting, â€˜advisedâ€™ Jr NTR against taking much time.

However, the actor enthralled the gathering with his late grandfatherâ€™s popular dialogue Neela inindaa Akaasam Baddalayyindaa annatluga vaccharante idenemo. Jr NTR declined to answer questions on his political debut. The actor said his entire family was backing him and there were no differences among them.

He clarified that the introduction of his cousin Taraka Rathana to the cine field was not a plot against him. Jr NTR said his uncle Balakrishna and brother Taraka Rathna were in fact his strengths in the field. According to local observers no public meeting in the recent past has drawn such a huge crowd.

Jr NTRâ€™s visit to Guntur city also was a big hit as a sea of humanity thronged the NTR stadium where he was felicitated by the executive committee of the stadium. Stadium committee secretary Ch Ramesh, Annabattini Sravan Kumar and a few film distributors were present at the function.

9,J&K polls not to be deferred: Farooq,"NEW DELHI: Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Farooq Abdullah on Monday ruled out the possibility of deferring Assembly polls, scheduled to be held before October 14 when the term of the present Assembly expires.

""There is no need for deferment of elections in the state as no catastrophe has struck nor any natural disaster has taken place,"" Abdullah, who had come along with his son and Minister of State for External Affairs Omar Abdullah, to meet the Prime Minister, said.

""You have poll observers from Election Commission monitoring the elections. Besides, we have a national as well as international media, which actually acts as a watchdog. So where is the scope of rigging,"" Abdullah said.

The state Assembly completes its term of six years on October 9 and has to be reconstituted before October 14.

10,CM to decide on helmet rule,"BANGALORE: The controversial issue of re-introducing the mandatory helmet rule will be decided by Chief Minister S.M. Krishna after a meeting with transport authorities in the next couple of days.

Transport Minister C.R. Sageer Ahmed told reporters here on Monday that the state government had taken note of Bangalore Police Commissioner H.T. Sangliana''s suggestion that helmets should be made mandatory in view of the rising number of accidents.

``I am not afraid of Sangliana, it is a decision that I should take. We also have a BATF recommendation as well as suggestions from NIMHANS asking for re-introduction of the rule. It has to be a state-wide rule, not just for Bangalore. I am personally in favour of it, but the decision has to be the CM''s'''' he maintained.

Ahmed pointed out that the rule had been stayed by the Karnataka High Court during the regime of H.D. Deve Gowda as CM. ``We have to take public opinion, discuss and decide if we should try to get this stay vacated,'''' he added.

Ahmed denied that a powerful helmet lobby was at work in trying to get the rule re-imposed. ``There is no lobby, the helmet is only an empty chip,'''' he contended.

SEAT-BELTS: Ahmed said further efforts would be made to enforce the seat-belt rule for four-wheelers. ``It is the educated who do not follow the rule. We are at our wits end on how to enforce it,'''' he rued.

Ahmed said there were plans at the Centre to further amend the Motor Vehicles Act and bring in seat-belts in the back seats of four-wheelers as well as in long distance buses.

11,Change in liquor policy deferred till Aug 1,"New Delhi: Delhiâ€™s dreams of having a carton of chilled beer delivered at the doorstep will have to wait. The stateâ€™s liberalised excise policy inviting private players to set up liquor shops has been deferred till August 1.

The Delhi state government had recently announced that they would allow private participation in liquor retailing in the city from July 1. State finance ministry sources said the decision had been postponed since most rules and regulations had not yet been framed.

â€˜â€˜Finance ministry officials are working on the nitty-gritty of the policy. They donâ€™t want to rush things as there are some grey areas which need to be taken care of,â€™â€™ a state finance ministry official said.

The liberalised excise policy will allow sale of beer at supermarkets and departmental stores which have an area more than 1,000 square feet. Customers can place orders through e-mails and fax for home delivery. Supermarkets and existing government-run liquor vends will be allowed to deliver at home at rates fixed by the excise department.

Treading cautiously with the home delivery experiment, the state government has not allowed placing orders over the telephone. Also, no hard drinks will be sold at supermarkets. The 250 government-run vends will be allowed to deliver only wine and beer at houses. Finance minister Mahinder Singh Saathi had said five private vends would be allowed in each of the nine districts. â€˜â€˜Not more than 70 private vends will be opened in Delhi,â€™â€™ he said. The provision of obtaining no-objection certificates from local legislative assembly members (MLAs) for setting up vends has also been scrapped. For private vends, owners will have to obtain a licence from the state excise department. However, to open new country liquor vends, which will continue to be under the state governmentâ€™s control, the excise department will have to seek an NOC from the local MLA.

Private liquor vends will sell liquor at the maximum retail price. The excise policy will also make bar coding mandatory.

12,Homosexuality law being reviewed,"New Delhi: The Centre has informed the Delhi high court that it is examining the legal, social and ethical aspects of legalising homosexuality among consenting adults. A division Bench comprising Justice Devinder Gupta and Justice S Mukerjee was hearing a petition seeking amendment of Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, which makes homosexuality a criminal offence.

Additional solicitor-general Mukul Rohtagi, appearing on behalf of the Centre, sought six weeks to file a reply. The court has fixed August 26 for the same. The Bench also dismissed a petition by a Kannur-based social organisation, Joint Action Council, which opposed the petition saying the court of law was not the competent forum to decide the issue. The court, however, allowed the council to join the issue as an intervener petitioner.

Earlier on January 27, the court had requested the Attorney General of India to address the court on the constitutional validity of the disputed Section. On December 7 last year, the court had taken cognizance of a petition filed by Naz Foundation, a gays rights group, and issued notices to the Centre, the Delhi state government, Union social welfare ministry, Delhi Police commissioner and the National AIDS Council.

The petition says Section 377 violates the right to life and liberty as provided in the Constitution.

Section 377, which is classified under sub-head â€˜Unnatural Offencesâ€™ in the IPC, reads: â€˜â€˜Whoever voluntarily has carnal intercourse against the order of nature with any man, woman or animal, shall be punished with imprisonment for life, or with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to 10 years and shall also be liable to fine.â€™â€™

13,PSEB may stop free power to farmers,"CHANDIGARH: A combination of tight finances and huge losses may force the Punjab State Electricity Board (PSEB) to argue for the removal of free power for farmers before the Punjab State Electricity Regulatory Commission (PSERC).

Sources said that some 26.5 per cent of the power generated by the boardâ€™s utilities is lost due to technical (16 per cent) and nontechnical (8.7 per cent) reasons. The nontechnical losses of the board include power theft as well.

â€œIn spite of continuous checks, power theft is a major problem. Some time ago a check was carried out in the border districts to estimate how much power was being lost due to theft. It was found that almost 35 per cent of the power was being â€˜stolen.â€™ Of the more than 15,000 connections checked (industrial and domestic), we found that some 5,300 were indulging in theft of power,â€� a senior board officer said. â€œKeeping in view these thefts and the difficult financial situation, an argument can be made for the removal of free power to farmers,â€� he said.

At the same time the board is expected to lose Rs 2,618 crore during the current year. If the tariff is not revised then the PSEB will have a revenue of Rs 5,239 crore and if the revision takes place then the revenue will jump upto Rs 7,857 crore, sources said.

However, the PSERC has said that it will take the views of all sections of consumers to arrive at a decision on hiking tariff in various categories. The decision of the board is expected sometime in August.

Meanwhile, the board has to pay a large sum to Central coal supply companies, which at the beginning of the month was Rs 133 crore. Chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh had said in the state assembly that this money would be paid back by the end of the month.

The Centre was told about the problem and has now asked the companies concerned to continue with the supply to the board.

14,PTDC seeks parting gift from govt,"CHANDIGARH: The Punjab Tourism Development Corporation (PTDC) Officersâ€™ Welfare Association has sought an attractive parting gift from the government in case its operations are wounded up as proposed by the disinvestment commission and indicated in the budget submitted last week in the Punjab Assembly.

In a letter written to the Punjab chief minister, the association has demanded that all employees who would be axed should be offered a uniform package of the Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS) or the â€˜â€˜golden handshakeâ€� irrespective of the fact whether the Public Sector Unit (PSU) is wound up, restructured or downsized.

The association suggests that employees should be paid an ex gratia at the rate of 90 daysâ€™ salary, including DA for every completed year of service or the salary for the number of months of service left - whichever is less.

Also, the employees should be paid gratuity and pension as permissible, provident fund and encashment of accumulated earned leave to the maximum of 360 days.

The association welcomed the move of the government to push reforms and disinvest those PSUs which it felt would generate funds for the cash-starved Punjab.
