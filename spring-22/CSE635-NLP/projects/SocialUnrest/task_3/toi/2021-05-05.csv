0,Daughter-in-law planned murder for property,"NEW DELHI: The daughter-in-law of 72-year-old Saudagar Singh, who was stabbed to death in his Pitampura home, was arrested on Tuesday.

According to the police, a property dispute between Singh and the accused, Kamaljeet Kaur, 25, led to the brutal attack on his family on Monday.

Singh''s wife Kuldeep Kaur, 68, and daughter Gurudeep, 35, were also injured in the incident. ""Kamaljeet was unhappy with his father-in-law for he had refused her a share in his property. She then planned the attack with two associates,"" said DCP (northwest) Sanjay Singh.

The victim''s son and Kamaljeet''s husband Gurumukh had committed suicide last year in January. Kamaljeet had been absconding since the incident.

The police said that she was arrested from near her Tilak Nagar home. ""She was on her way home to collect some clothes and other belongings when she was nabbed,"" said the officer.

She revealed to the police that she had sought help from two persons, Nawab, 24, and Balraj, 22, for eliminating Singh and his family members. Kamaljeet and Gurumukh had started living separately a few years ago after differences cropped up between him and his father.

She had been living alone since Gurumukh committed suicide last year and was apparently hard up financially.

""She gave birth to a child in August last year after which her financial problems were aggravated. She then came in touch with Nawab who became her good friend,"" said DCP Singh.

According to the police, Nawab and Balraj planned to eliminate Singhâ€™s entire family, to help Kamaljeet inherit the property.

1,Day of strange coincidences,"LUCKNOW: Buddha Purnima, which falls on the full moon night in the month of Vaisakha, commemorates the birth anniversary of Lord Buddha, founder of Buddhism, one of the oldest religions in the world. The 2548th Buddha Purnima was celebrated with much enthusiasm and religious fervour by the Buddhist community on Tuesday.

The members of Bauddha Dharmankur Sabha celebrated the day with administration of Panchasheela and Buddha Puja, religious congregation and offerings to the monks. Explaining the religious significance of the festival, KK Barua, member of the Sabha informed Times News Network that on this day, the Buddha was born, attained enlightenment, and also Nirvana. ""These strange coincidences give Buddha Purnima a unique significance,"" he said.

According to Buddhist legend, Buddha''s wife Yashodhara, his first disciple Ananda, his charioteer Channa, and the horse Kantaka which was his companion during his quest for truth of life, were all born on this sacred day. Even, the tree, called Bodhi tree, under which he attained Nirvana was believed to have been created on this day. And it was on this day Buddha chose to give his first sermon at Benaras (now Varanasi).

Barua informed that on this day, the Buddhists bathe and wear only white clothes. They gather in their vihars for worship and give alms to monks.

Many spend their entire day at the vihara listening to discourses on the life and teaching of the Buddha or invite monks to their places to speak to them. They reaffirm their faith in the five principles (Panchsheel) - not to take life, not to steal, not to lie, not to take liquor or other intoxicants and not to commit adultery.

2,Yunus' mother seeks damages for his arrest,"MUMBAI: Asiya Begum, Khwaja Yunusâ€™ mother, is set to file a suit in the Bombay high court seeking damages for the â€˜illegalâ€™ arrest of her son in the Ghatkopar blasts case.

While she was not available for comment, a family source from Parbhani told TNN, â€œYunus was illegally detained by Mumbai cops between December 23 and 27, 2002, before being framed in a false case.

""He was booked under Pota on January 3, 2003. But the police have no concrete evidence against him so far. The family will challenge the illegal detention and arrest.â€™â€™

The family will file the suit after consulting their lawyers Majeed Memon and Mihir Desai. Memon confirmed that Asiya Begum planned to file a suit challenging Yunusâ€™ arrest. â€œThe police have given a wrong picture that Yunus was picked up from his house in Parbhani.â€™â€™

He stated that Yunus was picnicking at Chikaldhara, a hill station in Vidarbha, when the police team arrived at his Parbhani residence. On seeing the cops, family members were nonplussed, but they co-operated with the police by giving them Yunusâ€™ mobile phone number.

When the cops spoke to Yunus, the latter agreed to meet them.He was, however, told not to come to his residence but to some other place on the outskirts of the town. Yunus was greeted by a crime branch inspector who directed him to sit in the police jeep.

4,Riot victim awaits 'elusive' right party,"BHAGALPUR: ""What is your name?"" asks little Imteyaz at the doorstep of a small house at Tatarpur locality of the town. The boy asks this question to every visitor because he wants to know the identity of each visitor.

Perhaps he wants to protect his mother. The boy''s mother is Mallika Begum, whose ordeals have not ended even after 15 years of 1989 Hindu-Muslim riots here.

She is one of the few surviving riot victims of Chanderi village, where 65 Muslims were butchered on October 27, 1989. The riots had broken out on October 24.

""The rioters butchered my parents and sisters before my eyes. They did not even spare the ''doodhmuha'' kids. I ran for safety to our family friend''s house, who was a Hindu. They also shut their doors. Later, the rioters caught me and ''amputated'' my right leg,"" she says.

The wounds appear to have healed, but the scars remain. ""Allah, the merciful, will do the justice. One of the rioters, Sushil Yadav''s whole family was electrocuted later,"" she says.

She was in her early teens during the riots. Now 28, Mallika completely understands the cruel world around her. When asked whom will she vote for, she remains poker-faced.

She asks: ""Whom should I vote for? I have seen the real face of every political party. Congress ruled during the 1989 communal riots. After that, RJD-led government ruled the state for 15 long years. All of them assured me of all possible help, which later proved false. I was promised job but I am still waiting for it. I am destined to lead a miserable life along with my kids.""

She says, ""The sitting CPM MP, Subodh Ray, visited my home last time. But, this time he also did not bother to visit my place.""

She knows that BJP is a ""communal"" party; still she does not hate it. Mallika''s husband, an armyman, deserted her in 1993, leaving behind two little kids with her.

But Mallika does not wait for him. She now keeps waiting for the ""right"" political party,which will provide a job to her and not remind her about riots during elections.

5,Pappu Yadav sticks to the law,"PATNA: For close to 24 hours, Madhepura was in a tizzy. The arrival and departure of jailed Purnia MP Rajesh Ranjan ""Pappu"" Yadav kept this constituency where two other Yadavs, Laloo and Sharad are locked in mortal combat, in a state of feverish anticipation.

Pappu, who has switched allegiance to Laloo Yadav''s RJD, came waving a court order requiring him to present himself at a fast track court at Madhepura.

Since then he may have removed his portly frame from town, but questions continue to haunt Madhepra.

Why did the MP, who faces several criminal cases suddenly appear? Did he intend to ""influence"" proceedings here?

6,Shoot-at-sight ordered for phase III polls,"PATNA: Borders have been sealed and shoot-at-sight orders issued against troublemakers as 12 Bihar constituencies, including Madhepura, where RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav is pitted against Union minister Sharad Yadav, go to polls on Wednesday.

Apparently under pressure in the face of the ongoing Election Commission probe into charges of largescale booth grabbing and violence during polling on April 26 in Chhapra, another constituency from where Laloo is in the fray, the state administration on Tuesday claimed to have deployed 16 companies of Central para-military forces (CPMF) and two companies of homeguard jawans in Madhepura.

At least 100 companies of CPMF, besides homeguards and District Armed Police personnel, have been deployed in the 12 constituencies, home commissioner B.K. Haldar said. CPMF will be guarding 90 per cent of the booths.

The Indo-Nepal border, touching constituencies like Purnia, where LJP strongman Pappu Yadav is seeking re-election to the Lok Sabha, and Araria, has been sealed to shut out anti-social and Naxalite elements during the polls.

7,New recruits' make no distinction,"JALANDHAR: The social scenario in the electioneering kaliedoscope presents pictures ranging from the bizzare, comic, absurd and at times to the absurd, or even surreal, depending on the perception.

A whole lot of machinery associated with elections is yanked into action, more so the shady and criminal section of society as money is pumped into the market for a show of strength and if beed be for bogus voting and for intimidation of certain rival groups.

Body builders are no longer seen in the gyms and health clubs where they usually while away time in the mornings and evenings. They have been hired by various candidates to add ''deshat'' to their rallies where they display their biceps.

Not knowing that what is on display is only ''paper muscles'' puffed up with anabolic steroids they pass off as bouncers and bodyguards to the candidates who by and by are getting diminutive.

There is no happier lot than the street dogs of this ''whiskey city'' where every hotel is a bar and before the election ''drinking dens'' come up while the bars are redundant, or meant only for the few who spend their ''hard-earned'' money for drinks.

The chicken sellers are also a happy lot as the body-builders are fond of having chicken with booz. All of a sudden the card playing venues, which all year round can be seen buzzing with activity in the backward mohallas, wear a desrted look. On queries it is found that they are no longer hooked on to gambling and have found employment in the election machinery.

Not to be left behind as the rumour goes around that the goodies are being distributed free as it is the last week before the polls, the groups smuggling liquor into the city from Chandigarh and from distilleries legal as well as illegal, also merge with the electioneering as their smuggling agents are already there.

There are numerous gambling, smack and charas peddling and illegal liquor selling spots in areas such as Model House, Buta Mandi, Ali Mohalla, Valmiki Gate, Rasta Mohalla, Dhan Mohalla, Qila Mohalla, Gandhi Camp, the list is endless and subject for a PhD in ''absent policing''.

All these areas are these days registering almost zero per cent activity.The body-builders and the smugglers join the electioneering machinery because they need political shelter, it is learnt.

An interesting observation was made by a local old-timer. The same faces can be seen in rival party rallies in various mohallas of the city. Why not, one may ask. The new recruits are over-enthusiastic and do not make any distinctions of caste, creed, or political colour.

8,Poll rally shifting exposes intra-party bickerings,"SOLAN: The last-minute shift of Thursday''s election rally of BJP star campaigner and the Gujarat chief minister, Narender Modi from Solan to Dharampur has exposed the continuing intra-party bickerings in the state BJP cadres, giving a severe jolt to the Solan legislator, Dr Rajeev Bindal and offering much-needed boost to the just-re-entered BJP dissident and the former state tourism minister, Mahendra Nath Sofat.<br /><br />While Dr Rajeev Bindal denied that the change of Modi''s election rally to Dharampur was anything to do with the re-induction of Sofat in the party-fold, the local BJP leaders think otherwise. <br /><br />Recalling the last assembly election rally of Modi last year in Solon, a senior BJP leader stated that Sofat and his breakaway BJP group had created quite a ruckus in that rally, inviting the local police to intervene and control the situation. <br /><br />This time around, the state BJP think-tank did not want to take any risk for the repeat of the same noisy scenes and decided upon shifting the Modi''s rally to Dharampur, instead, stated a BJP local leader.<br /><br />Another significant reason being given behind this change of venue indicates to the recent annoyance of yet another BJP leader of substance from the Kasauli assembly constituency, Virender Kashyap. <br /><br />Kashyap, having a strong fan-following in Kasauli region, has contested the parliamentary and assembly elections, unsuccessfully a number of times, has remained the chairman of state marketing board. He was not present, either, in the election rally of the former state chief minister, Prem Kumar Dhumal at Kasauli, nor at the Solon rally of union agriculture minister, Raj Nath Singh.<br /><br />But the Solon BJP legislator, Dr Bindal refuted this sudden development, stating that by organising Modi''s election rally at Dharampur, the party was hoping to garner the public support from the three assembly constituencies in the district, Kasauli, Doon and Solon, at one go. <br /><br />But, the local BJP cadre is not at all amused at the change of rally''s venue from Solon to Dharampur at this eleventh hour, jeopardising all their pre-rally plans at the last moment.<br /><br /><formid=367815><br /> </formid=367815>

9,Punjab border sealed ahead of polls,"FEROZEPUR: With five days left for the Lok Sabha polling to take place, the entire Punjab border touching Haryana and Rajasthan has been sealed with the deployment of para-military forces.

About four companies of the security forces have been deployed in five Lok Sabha constituencies, Ferozepur, Faridkot, Bathinda, Sangrur and Patiala, bordering the two states to prevent inflow of anti-social elements and smuggling of narcotics in the wake of election.

While the inter-state border along the Faridkot Parliamentary constituency has been sealed following the Election Commission directive, in rest of the constituencies the police have taken this step as a precautionary measure.

The ECs order for special security in the Faridkot constituency has been made in the wake of reports of musclemen trooping in the area from neighbouring Sirsa district in all elections taking place in the district.

In view of the proximity of the families of former Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal and Haryana Chief Minister Om Parkash Chautala, the Congress had expressed its apprehension about the Chautalas green brigade being used by SAD nominee Sukhbir Badal to intimidate voters.

Besides, the smuggling of narcotics tend to pick up in these areas during the election period when the political parties openly distribute items like poppy husk and opium among their workers as also among voters to woo them.

Located close to the Punjab border, Sriganganagar (Rajasthan) and Rania (Haryana) have been two major centres from where the drugs are procured for smuggling.

The Congress leaders in the region had shared their concern at the problem with Chief Minister Amarinder Singh. The chief minister subsequently directed the police to be vigilant against and deal with smugglers strictly.
