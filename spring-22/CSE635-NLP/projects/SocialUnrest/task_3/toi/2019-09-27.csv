0,Former minister seeks compensation for farmers,"GUNTUR: Former minister and Pedakurapadu MLA Kanna Lakshminarayana has demanded that the state government should pay compensation to all farmers under the Nagarjunasagar ayacut for crop losses.

Addressing a press conference here on Thursday, he said that the farmers had to face the crisis during this kharif solely because of the state government''s bungling of issues.

Even experts in the irrigation sector observed that the release of water to the hydel power projects had caused irreparable loss to the farmers as water could have been used for the purpose of irrigation, he said.

He also pointed out that there was meaning in allocating nearly 30 per cent of the funds for the sake of publicity in the name of incidental expenditure from the loan amount obtained for Velugu scheme.

He said that the state government had set up a separate society for the implementation of the programme, which was done through the district rural development agencies (DRDAs) in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan.

He alleged that the chief minister had been resorting to cheap publicity tactics instead of sincerely trying to help the needy. Kanna Lakshminarayana said that the amount separated for the initial establishment and other incidental expenditure could be avoided if the Velugu scheme was implemented through district rural development agencies and that amount, could be used to help farmers in the state.

1,"CM’s dharna political stunt, says Badal","CHANDIGARH: Chief minister C a p t Amarinder S i n g h â€™ s d h a r n a and court a r r e s t along with other senior party leaders in Delhi on Thursday has rattled the Shiromani Akali Dal and other political parties, who have been in race for political oneupmanship over the issue of MSP.

While SAD president Parkash Singh Badal dismissed Amarinderâ€™s action as â€œpolitical stuntâ€�, senior BJP leader Balramji Dass Tondon described it as â€œpolitical melodramaâ€� which, he said, had undermined the grace and dignity of the chief ministerâ€™s office. He said for good part the chief minister kept sleeping on the matter and then suddenly decided to take to streets.

Badal demanded that till the Centre announced the MSP the state government agencies should start procurement without any further delay and asked them to maintain purchase records for payment of arrears on account of any anticipated rise in the MSP.

In a statement here on Thursday, Badal alleged a deep-rooted conspiracy by the chief minister and the Congress high command behind the delay in procurement operations by the state government purchase agencies.

Holding the state government responsible for not starting the procurement of paddy that had already arrived in the mandis, he said there was no reason for the state government agencies to delay the operation on the pretext of non-fixation of the new MSP. As per the existing practice and precedents, a bulk of the purchase is in any case done by these agencies in anticipation of the announcement of the new price.

Payment of arrears on the difference between the new and the old MSP is always made retrospectively.

Badal also said that the cause of the state farmers would have been served far better if the chief minister had taken the matter seriously in August than resorting to few hours of political stunts now. He should undergo a penance and a fast for his declarations that Punjab farmers faced no problems due to drought when the entire peasantry was crying aloud in suffering, he added.

Badal sought Amarinderâ€™s explanation as to why he delayed his efforts in securing better MSP for paddy till September 23 when he knew that the procurement operations normally began on September 21. Actually, he was making merry in the UK and Scotland when he should have been busy for the MSP cause, Badal said, adding that during his term as chief minister procurements went on smoothly because the SAD-BJP government used to initiate lobbying with the Centre months in advance.

The former chief minister re-iterated his partyâ€™s demand for Rs 750 per quintal as MSP, non-inclusion of the purchase tax of 7.5 per cent in the MSP, immediate start of purchase by the state and the Central agencies, waiving of interest on all co-operative and agricultural loans, deferment of payment of the principle amount of these loans and payment of compensation to the farmers for the damage done due to drought and unseasonal rains.

2,Amarinder courts arrest on paddy price issue,"NEW DELHI: After courting arrest on Thursday morning along with his ministers, MLAs and other party workers, Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh told reporters that he had asked Prime Minister Vajpayee to announce the minimum support price (MSP) for paddy at the earliest.

In the 40-minute meeting, Singh also told the PM that the Food Corporation of India (FCI) should immediately lift 2.8 lakh tonnes of foodgrain lying in the state godowns.

He gave a detailed picture of how â€˜â€˜marginal farmers in the border areasâ€™â€™ are resorting to distress sale of paddy much below even last yearâ€™s MSP of Rs 560 per quintal. â€˜â€˜Farmers have sold it for between Rs 400 and Rs 450 a quintal.

This is gross injustice to them. Already, more than 400 farmers have committed suicide. They should be compensated,â€™â€™ he said.

He also demanded that along with the MSP, the Centre should also announce bonus of Rs 100 per quintal since the farmers have incurred heavy expenditure to overcome the drought.

On the issue of the state government levying a cess on the foodgrain procured by the FCI, Singh said: â€˜â€˜We reiterated that lowering of cess from 11.5 per cent to four per cent will affect the rural infrastructure. Leave alone constructing new roads, even the existing ones will not be left. In case the Centre does not change its decision, I have demanded Rs 1,000 crore as compensation.â€™â€™

According to him, the PM gave a patient hearing and assured him that a cabinet meeting had been called in the evening to take a decision on the issue.

In case MSP is announced, Singh said, Fridayâ€™s plan of a â€˜â€˜rail rokoâ€™â€™ agitation will be cancelled. Otherwise, the state Congress president will announce the future course of the agitation. â€˜â€˜Punjab has reached the end of its tether,â€™â€™ he said. However, Singhâ€™s court arrest and meeting with the PM showed the clear division in his government. An agitated agriculture minister Ravinder Kaur Bhattal asked the CM why she was not included in the team.

3,"VHP bandh peaceful, costs nation Rs 1,000 crore","NEW DELHI: The bandh called by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad brought life to a standstill in Mumbai and Gujarat, but the rest of the country showed little enthusiasm for it.

The bandh was called to protest against Tuesdayâ€™s terrorist attack in Gandhinagarâ€™s Swaminarayan Temple, in which 37 people were killed.

The VHP has a strong presence in Maharashtra and Gujarat. In other states, where there was a partial response, it was more out of a fear of violence by unruly protesters.

Incidents of violence were reported from several pockets of Gujarat, including Ahmedabad, where a 500-strong mob attacked a mutton shop in Bapunagar. Two roadside stalls including a auto-repair shop were damaged in the subsequent violence. Fourteen people were arrested later. The minority community spent the day behind closed doors. Many went back to the relief camps for the day. In Surat, two people were injured by Bajrang Dal activists in separate incidents. Reports of stray violence came from Rajkot and Vadodara as well.

In Mumbai, the Shiv Sena-Vishwa Hindu Parishadâ€™s formidable bandh enforcement network failed to score a perfect ten.

While the usual fear psychosis kept most people indoors, several motorists ventured out at the risk of their windscreens being smashed, some trains and flights operated and several shops remained defiantly open.

Loading and unloading at the docks was also near-normal.

BJP MP Kirit Somaiya described the bandh as ""total and spontaneous"".

Mumbai is estimated to have lost more than a hundred crore rupees as a result of the bandh, according to industry sources.

The production loss for the state was more than Rs 200 crore, while the figure for the country as a whole was more than Rs 1,000 crore, said All India Association of Industries President Vijay Kalantri.

Industry officials said that a simple protest march would have saved crores of rupees. The CII estimates that the loss for the city alone was between Rs 120 crore and Rs 130 crore.

""Although we condemn the attack on the Akshardham temple in Gandhinagar, we strongly feel that such events should not be politicised as bandhs are not the right form of response to an act of terrorism. Our view is that a deeper understanding among cross-communities is required,"" said CII Senior Director Chandrajit Banerjee.

With few people making it to their offices on Thursday, trading volumes in the debt and forex markets were thin. The stock markets fared a little better and at the Bombay Stock Exchange, a block deal in ICICI Bank shares worth Rs 1,300 crore helped the exchange clock a turnover of close to Rs 2,000 crore as opposed to an average of Rs 1,000 crore.

Trains were stopped at 17 stations across the city, stones were pelted and the tyres of several BEST buses were deflated, while two political workers were injured in a clash at Jogeshwari.

VHP activists demonstrated outside the US consulate on Thursday morning, protesting against the office being open on the day of a national bandh. The consulate closed for half an hour on the advice of the police, spokesperson Elizabeth Corwin said.

""Preventive arrests were carried out to neutralise the trouble-makers. In Mumbai alone, 246 persons were arrested while 1,250 persons were put behind bars across the state,"" Deputy Chief Minister Chhagan Bhujbal told newspersons at a press conference held in Mantralaya on Thursday.

Incidents of stone-pelting and police lathicharge marred the bandh in UP as well. A number of VHP and Bajrang Dal workers were rounded up when they tried to close shops forcibly.

In Jammu and Kashmir, the bandh evoked partial response. Parts of Jammu observed a shutdown. All government institutions were closed as a precautionary measure and attendance in public sector undertakings and banks was thin. In Patna, fearing violence, big shops and business establishments downed shutters and private bus operators suspended services during the day.

The bandh, however, had little impact in other areas of Bihar.

In West Bengal, Orissa and Chattisgarh, the day saw a spate of arrests of VHP activists. Heavy police deployment was made in Raipur.

In Andhra, Chandigarh, New Delhi and the north-eastern states barring Assam, the bandh had little impact.

Barring a few incidents of damage to railway properties and disruption of rail services, it passed off peacefully.

The bandh supporters had exempted Gaya from the purview of bandh in view of the ongoing â€˜pitripaksha melaâ€™.

According to police sources, as many as 78 bandh supporters were arrested in Bihar. In Jharkhand, 395 persons were taken into preventive custody, of which 125 persons were taken into custody in Jamshedpur and 114 in Ranchi.

7,DF govt has failed on every front: BJP,"MUMBAI: The state unit of the BJP has described the Democratic Front (DF) regime in Maharashtra as an â€œoverdraft governmentâ€™â€™ and has tried to portray it as a complete failure in comparison to the 24-party coalition led by Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee at the Centre.

â€œWhile the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government under Mr Vajpayee has achieved spectacular progress on various fronts, the DF government is only clinically alive,â€™â€™ according to a booklet issued by the Maharashtra unit of the BJP.

Written by state BJP spokesman Prakash Javadekar and with a foreword by state BJP president Pandurang Phundkar, the 24-page booklet has blamed the DF regime led by Vilasrao Deshmukh for â€œbringing Maharashtra to the brink of bankruptcyâ€™â€™.

â€œWhereas the NDA government has been making efforts to make life easier for the masses, the DF regime has been robbing the people,â€™â€™ the booklet said.

Listing the failures, the booklet said the DF government scrapped one welfare scheme after another, which were launched by the previous Shiv Sena-BJP alliance. Besides the free housing scheme, the DF deprived more than one crore poor people of the cereals they used to get at concessional rates.

Homes for the aged and military schools stopped getting their financial assistance. A mega project to construct toilets in rural areas was abandoned. Maharashtra has witnessed 47 communal riots within 33 months of DF rule, the booklet said.

8,Poor attendance hits Mantralaya during bandh,"MUMBAI: The Shiv Sena-Vishwa Hindu Parishadâ€™s bandh affected the working Mantralaya because of the poor turnout of employees.

Only 15-17 per cent of the staff reported for work on Thursday, Mr Bhujbal said, adding that although essential services were spared, educational institutions remained closed.

Irate mobs in Thane, Ahmednagar, Umergaon and Nanded burnt effigies of Gen Pervez Musharraf, he said. Mr Bhujbal added that public places and religious sites would have to review their security arrangements and undertake security for their premises. The police would only assist the organisers to prevent any untoward incidents.

About 90 per cent of the police force was used for the bandobast, while 57 platoons the SRPF were posted at strategic locations on Thursday.

In Mumbai, stone pelting city buses was reported from Ghatkopar, Malad, Govandi, Byculla, Airoli, Gorai and Andheri. The local police had stepped up security around various sensitive zones as well as places of worship, including the Swaminarayan temple in Dadar, the ISKCON temple in Juhu and the Siddhivinayak temple in Prabhadevi.

The rail roko began at 7.45 m. when Sena activists halted trains at Dombivli station by placing sleepers on the tracks. Although services were restored within half an hour, the Dombivli incident was followed by a series of rail rokos at other stations including Kalyan, Badlapur, Kalva, Thane, Mulund, Chembur, Wadala, Kandivli, Malad, Goregaon, Jogeshwari, Andheri, Elphinstone Road, Parel, Grant Road, Charni Road and Marine Lines. Railway police commissioner Rakesh Maria claimed, â€œWe cleared the protesters from the tracks within 15 minutes and the trains were only delayed by about half an hour.â€™â€™

In Dadar, protesters damaged six food stalls while a mob broke glass at the Chinchpokli railway booking office and a newspaper stall at Andheri station. Stalls were also forcibly shut down at the Dadar, Andheri and Malad stations. Train drivers were escorted by gun- totting policemen while SRP personnel guarded womenâ€™s compartments.

Nearly 500 local trains on both the WR and CR were cancelled. The services were normalised by early afternoon.

Incoming mail and express trains on the CR were also affected and some of them arrived late by more than three hours. Three trainsâ€”the Sinhagad Express, Pragati Express and the Panchavati Express â€”were terminated at stations beyond Kalyan. Departure timings of the trains that managed to reach Mumbai were rescheduled, notably the Pune Deccan Queen.

On the Western Railway, four incoming trainsâ€”the August Kranti Rajdhani Express, the Bhuj-Mumbai Kutch Express, the Bikaner-Bandra Rankapur Express and the Surat- Mumbai Flying Raneeâ€”arrived about 45 minutes behind schedule.

Although 70 per cent of the BMCâ€™s conservancy staff reported for work, cleanliness in the city suffered as garbage trucks could not reach the clearing spots. The corporation would implement night-cleaning operations to clear the backlog, civic officials said.

Only ten per cent of the civic employees working in the administrative section attended office. In civic hospitals, the turnout of outdoor patients was as low as one per cent of the attendance on normal days. Surgeries were conducted as usual. In the Jijamata Udyan, popularly known as Rani Baug in Byculla, the animals were fed and bathed as usual as the keepers stayed within the zoo premises on Wednesday night. The two major ports of Maharashtraâ€”the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT) at Nhava Sheva and the Mumbai Port Trust (MbPT)â€” functioned normally despite the bandh in the city.

MbPT recorded 70 per cent attendance. Loading and unloading went on as usual on eight vessels, while five vessels suffered because there were no trailer trucks to carry the cargo, comprising mainly chick peas, according to an MbPT spokesperson.

Attendance at the MbPT office was affected, but casual workers who help with loading and unloading reported for work.

Indian Airlines (IA) operated the majority of its services, but cancelled flights to Mangalore, Rajkot and Thiruvanathanapuram because of poor passenger load. Air-India and Jet Airways operated all their flights according to the revised schedule. AI cancelled two flightsâ€” one on the Mumbai-Bangkok sector via Kolkata and Guwahati and the other to Singapore (AI-436). Five flights were rescheduled.

Autorickshaws displayed solidarity by going off the roads in Maharashtra. â€œIf at all a few were seen, it was because they had gone for repairs,â€™â€™ said Sharad Rao, general secretary of the Hind Mazdoor Kisan Panchayat and president of the Bombay Autorickshaw Menâ€™s Union.

Loading and unloading at the docks was also nearnormal.

The nationwide strike was called by the VHP and supported by the Shiv Sena in the state to protest the gunning down of innocents at Gandhinagarâ€™s Swaminarayan temple on Tuesday.

BJP M.P. Kirit Somaiya described the bandh as â€œtotal and spontaneousâ€™â€™.

Mumbai is estimated to have lost more than a hundred crore rupees as a result of the bandh, according to industry sources.

VHP activists demonstrated outside the US consulate on Thursday morning, protesting against the office being open on the day of a national bandh. The consulate closed for half an hour on the advice of the police, spokesperson Elizabeth Corwin said.

In Jogeshwari, the clash took place after the bandh-enforcers asked vegetable vendors to stop their business and an altercation followed, a senior police officer said. â€œThe incident occurred when an appeal by some of our workers to participate in the bandh was opposed by members of a particular community,â€™â€™ city unit BJP chief Vinod Tawde said. However, Maharashtra minister of state for home Kripashankar Singh said the incident was â€œnot seriousâ€™â€™.

Many offices and educational institutions remained closed on Thursday.â€�

Nearly 80 per cent of routine activity was affected by the bandh, with two incidents of stone throwing on city buses in Nagpur in the last 24 hours,â€™â€™ additional director general of police (law and order) O.P. Bali said.

â€œThere was heavy bandobast across the state with additional security forces being deployed in nearly 20 communally sensitive zones in the state,â€™â€™ he added. With the arrest of potential trouble-makers hours before the bandh began on Thursday morning, the police administration ensured that there was no large- scale violence stone-throwing in Maharashtra. â€œPreventive arrests were carried out to neutralise the trouble-makers. Mumbai alone, 246 persons were arrested while 1,250 persons were put behind bars across the state,â€™â€™ deputy chief minister Chhagan Bhujbal told newspersons at a press conference held in Mantralaya on Thursday.

The police also detained 125 persons in Mumbai for playing an active role building tension in their areas. As many as 90 of those detained were subsequently released, Mr Bhujbal said.

10,Students protest as hostel inmate drowns,"WARANGAL: Tribal Welfare Hostel inmates and the students federation of India (SFI) members staged a lightning road blockade at the Hanamkonda Chowrastha on Thursday afternoon, after a 13-year-old boy Laudya Harinayak, Class IX student in the Reddypuram hostel was washed away in the Kakatiya canal waters in the morning.

The students blocked road traffic for more than half an hour. Police resorted to lathicharge to disperse the mob and two student leaders Veeranna and Bhikshapathi were taken into custody.

The victim and his schoolmates went for a bath in the canal at the instance of the warden. The victim drowned while trying to rescue two of his classmates from drowning in the flowing canal waters.

The students, numbering around 200 in the hostel, have been taking bath in the Kakatiya Canal for the past few days as the water source to the hostel was suspended. Even sanitation and bathroom facilities were not available in the hostel and the students were compelled to go to the canal for ablution. The Hanamkonda fire brigade are trying to trace the boy.

But, the body was yet to be recovered when reports last came in at 4.30 pm. The deceased is a native of Enugallu village of Parvathagiri mandal. It may be recalled that a student from the Dharmasagar Bridge School fell victim to a snakebite this month in the residential complex, while eight students fell ill in the Madiguda Tribal Welfare School hostel on Wednesday last.

11,"VHP, BJP satisfied with response to bandh","KOLKATA: The Vishwa Hindu Parishad and BJP were more than satisfied with the response to the VHP-sponsored bandh call in the districts on Thursday, although the Left Front claimed that it was a total flop.

As reports of disturbance came in from Behrampore, Murshidabad, Burdwan, Mangalkot, Katwa, Nadia, Birbhum and Hooghly, VHP state general secretary Ajay Kumar Nandi declared that the bandh was spontaneous.

""We are not a political party and did not try to enforce anything. We had not expected any response in Kolkata, though some shops in Burrabazar remained shut, as the state administration was bent on foiling the bandh. However, in the districts, administrative efforts failed to rein in the bandh supporters,"" said Nandi.

BJP state secretary Hemen Guha Roy said that he was astonished that the VHP had managed to gather 2,000-2,500 people for a rally in the city. ""There was good response to the bandh in the districts as majority sentiments are hurt. Refugees from Bangladesh who come into the bordering districts of West Bengal, narrate the atrocities occurring there. We have received information of a clash from Dankuni,"" Roy said. Nandi concurred, ""The people are concerned with atrocities and uncontrolled infiltration from Bangladesh. Wherever there is a sizeable population of Hindu refugees from Bangladesh, there has been a positive response.""

Congress sources agreed that the struggle for survival in the border districts had created antagonism within the population. Pradesh Congress leader Manas Bhuiyan, , said that he was not very concerned. ""One must remember that the state had two Jan Sangh MPs in 1952, so there are still some BJP pockets here. Narayangarh in West Midnapore is one such place. There isnâ€™t much cause for concern as the people of the state are not fundamentalists,"" he said. The Trinamul Congress reacted cautiously. ""We condemned the Gujarat incident but did not support the bandh,"" said Pankaj Banerjee.

13,VHP’s bandh call partially successful in state,"LUCKNOW: It was more out of fear of violence than support that majority of shops in main markets of the state capital remained closed till early Thursday evening. The occasion was Vishwa Hindu Parishadâ€™s â€˜Bharat Bandhâ€™ call which passed off by and large peacefully.

Sporadic incidents of violence were reported from certain pockets where activists wearing saffron headbands forced closure of shops, damaged showrooms and smashed windscreens of private vehicles. Attempts to stop trains were foiled owing to adequate deployment of force at stations. By late evening, markets were open, but shoppers were sparse.

Patrolling by police personnel began well before dawn, as men in uniform were seen looking for wall writings and objectionable posters. By daybreak, the police took to main market areas. Till 10 am no untoward incident was reported, as there was partial response to the bandh call. However around 10.30 am, some VHP activists reached Lalbagh area and forced closure of shops. They smashed the stocks kept in the shop and forced owners to down shutters. They completed the operation within minutes and fled the scene before the police could reach the site.

In Hazratganj, trouble began when three youths, later identified as Swantantra Kumar Tripathi, son of deputy inspector general Dhanvir Singh and Raju Kashchyap who claimed to be VHP activists, smashed the windscreens of three tempos, a van and a car near Halwasiya. They were promptly arrested by the police.

Later a group of Bajrang Dal activists led by the state co-convenor Ved Prakash Sachan stormed shops near Hanuman temple in Hazratganj forcing them to down the shutters. This led to a panic reaction as all the shops in the area began to down their shutters and the sequence continued up to Lalbagh crossing. Sachan and his supporters were also arrested when they tried to block the road in Hazratganj. They were later released from the police lines after submitting a bond. At Charbagh railway station, VHP activists tried to stop the Rajdhani train leaving Lucknow for Delhi. They were rounded by the Government Railway Police and the Railway Protection Force personnel at the platform itself. One of the activist managed to sneak away and tried to jump before the engine. He was also apprehended. They were detained as the train left the platform on scheduled time.

Contingents of police and Rapid Action Force personnel cordoned the VHP office at Hussainganj crossing and at Cantonment road. However main markets in Aishbagh, Naka, Hazratganj, Chowk, Nishatganj, Mahanagar, Indiranagar and Gomtinagar remained closed more out of fear of violence than in support of the bandh. Many shops in these areas were later found to be open. It was a weekly closure for Aminabad and Alambagh market.

14,State ministers launch austerity drive,"KOLKATA: West Bengal ministers, flustered by chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjeeâ€™s continuous stress on reducing personal and governmental expenses, have gone on an austerity drive in their respective departments â€” reducing cars, keeping a tab on official telephones and even bringing their own tea from home!

Some ministers told TNN on Tuesday that they had initiated cost cutting measures months before the state government faced the ongoing fund crunch. â€œWhen I met my staff after assuming office, I felt the department was over-staffed. So, when the next recruitment request came from another section, I transferred some of them instead of taking new people. It saved a lot of money,â€� technical education minister Md Salim said. Salim said he had taken other â€œunpopular but necessary measuresâ€� to cut costs.

â€œWhen I received a file on how many cars my department has I found many cars being used for unimportant work. I have put a stop to this. â€œSimilarly I keep a copy of all departmental telephone bills. In December, I will compare it with last yearâ€™s bills to see how we can stop spiralling costs here,â€� he said. Law minister Nisith Adhikary said he believed an austerity drive had to be led from the front by the departmentâ€™s minister-in-charge. â€œFor instance when I became a minister in 1996, I received a pen stand and two expensive pens. In 2001 the government wanted to give me a new set. I refused since the last set was working well enough. And because I refused, all employees in my team followed suit,â€� he said.

Adhikary said his car still doesnâ€™t sport a red light on top and, â€œIf have any work on a Sunday I drive my old car to work. Sometimes even walk to the Writersâ€™. Even the tea that I serve guests in office is brought from home in a flask,â€� he said, adding, â€œthese are small measures. But add them up over a year and see how much we saveâ€�. PWD minister and veteran RSP leader Amar Chowdhury too is trying to stop spiralling phone bills. â€œI have installed locks in almost all official phones in PWD offices throughout West Bengal.""

Still unless all employees come clean and help in saving money, things will not improve. Reducing cost by buying less garlands for the CM is fine, but to bring back money to state coffers, a sustained campaign is needed and we have to lead by example,â€� he said.

15,VHP bandh partially successful in state,"KOLKATA: The Vishwa Hindu Parishadâ€™s Bharat Bandh on Thursday evoked a partial response in the state.

While Kolkata was largely unaffected, except for parts of Burrabazar, the impact of the bandh was felt in north Bengal.

Closer to Kolkata, demonstrations on rail tracks disrupted running of trains. Shops, markets, schools, colleges and commercial offices were closed in many towns, including Siliguri, Darjeeling and Malda. The highways in north Bengal were also deserted. Attendance in offices in Siliguri and Birbhum was around 50 per cent.

In south Bengal, there was a partial response in some districts, including North and South 24-Parganas, Midnapore, Burdwan and Murshidabad. Shops and markets were closed in some places and train services were disrupted in North and South 24-Parganas. The impact of the bandh was felt in Narayangarh area of Midnapore and Behrampore in Murshidabad.

A total of 315 people were arrested in the state for obstructing roads, inspectorgeneral of police (law and order) Chayan Mukherjee said in Kolkata. â€œThe arrest figure is, however,much less than last time when more than 1,800 people had been rounded up,â€� Mukherjee said. â€œTen people were arrested for picketing in front of the Malda collectorate and the Asansol unit VHP vice-president was also arrested for trying to forcibly shut the local fish market.â€�

â€œIndustries, collieries and tea gardens were not affected. Last time, there was widespread agitation in Hasnabad. This time there was no incident,â€� Mukherjee said. Train services were disrupted in a number of places on the Howrah and Sealdah divisions of the Eastern Railway, according to an ER release. On the Howrah-Burdwan main line section, there was picketing at Debipur station for over an hour in the morning. Seven trains were detained and three cancelled. On the Sealdah division, there was picketing at Canning for over five hours and at Taldi and at Dakshin Barasat. There were demonstrations at Ranaghat, Krishnagar, Shantipur and Pyaradanga on the Sealdah-Krishnagar section.

16,"Now, politics over piety and pandal","KOLKATA: There is no shortage of novel themes for Durga Puja pandals. But this year, the Santosh Mitra Square Puja has possibly come up with the most topical as well as political theme â€” railway bifurcation.

The theme of the Santosh Mitra Square is the brainchild of Pradip Ghosh, mayor-in-council member of the Kolkata Municipal Corporation, who is also the president of the Puja committee.

A city-based decorator has been chosen to erect a 160-by-120 feet pandal which will be a replica of the Eastern Railway headquarters building at Fairlie Place. A model of a 19th century train will also be built, which will be seen coming out of the building and moving toward a station marked â€˜Dhanbadâ€™.

Having kept the theme under wraps all this while, Ghosh revealed his masterstroke on Thursday. But he refused to divulge the budget for the Puja, which is traditionally one of the biggest crowd-pullers.

It is learnt that the budget for the Puja is a whopping Rs 60 lakh. Of this, 70 per cent will go towards building the pandal.

The Puja committee is also bearing the expenditure of a 25-member artistsâ€™ delegation from France. The French artists have been entrusted with creating a unique sculpture which will be placed adjacent to the main pandal.

Ghosh is known for coming up with surprising themes. He first shot to the limelight after he constructed a pandal shaped like a gigantic ship.Another year, the Santosh Mitra Square Puja displayed the Bilaspur Train tragedy.

Senior leaders of the Trinamul Congress feel that Ghosh is out to gain political mileage with the bifurcation theme. â€œIt is not a question of political mileage. I have chosen the subject to air the grievances of the people of the state who are sure to get affected because of the bifurcation of Eastern Railway,â€� says Ghosh. With the bifurcation theme, Ghosh has definitely scored over his boss, mayor Subrata Mukherjee, who is also a rival Puja organiser. Mukherjeeâ€™s Puja, Ekdalia Evergreen, has a much more traditional Ramayana as its theme.

Ghosh has already held meetings with the Kolkata Police authorities for enforcing some restrictions for visitors since he expects huge crowds because of the controversial theme.

18,Govt mulls over Rs 4000 cr relief package for farmers,"NEW DELHI: Government is considering a relief package of over Rs 4000 crore to farmers in view of the crop loss suffered by them due to drought and to enable them to step up the coming rabi output.

""Recommendations of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices for MSP-linked bonus, rolling back of fertiliser prices to pre-budget level and waiver of interests on farm loans will be considered actively"", Union Agriculture Minister Ajit Singh said on Friday.

""Our priority is to get the proposal for bonus beyond the Minimum Support Prices cleared fast. Effort is to place it in the next Cabinet meeting and my ministry will send a note in a day or two to expedite the matter"", he said, adding that bonus would ensure proper use of inputs like power and fertilisers.

While the bonus of Rs 20 per quintal of paddy proposed by the CACP is estimated to put an additional burden of about Rs 400-450 crore, cut in fertiliser prices would would cost about Rs 500 crore, Singh told reporters after opening a conference of state ministers on agricultural marketing reform.

On the proposal for writing off interests, the minister declined to disclose any rough estimate of the quantum of extra money likely to be borne by the government, but ministry officials said it could be Rs 2500-3000 crore.

Speaking at the conference, Singh said the coming rabi crops are also likely to be affected by drought as late sowing by farmers may delay wheat cultivation to some extent, though late monsoon rains have reduced the impact.

Water reservoir position is again not sufficient, he said, adding that in states like Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh water would pose a serious problem.
