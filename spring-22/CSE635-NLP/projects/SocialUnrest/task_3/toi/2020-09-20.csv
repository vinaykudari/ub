0,Teacher-led movement heads for clash with Modi govt,"AHMEDABAD: The convention to be organised by Maha-Gujarat Navnirman Front on Sunday at Akashganga Maidan here is heading for trouble with the Narendra Modi government.

While the city police have denied permission to the front to hold such a convention, the organisers said they will not be deterred by any government attempt to stall their programme and will continue with their plan.

A senior police official said that if the front tries to go ahead with their plan which is aimed against policies of the government, they will detain its members under section 144 for defying prohibitory orders.

The front, meanwhile, said in a statement that rally, hunger strike, convention are democratic means of expressing one''s dissent and cannot be curbed.

""If the government attempts to crush our movement or disrupt our convention, we will strongly resist the move. We will knock the doors of the Supreme Court and appeal to the President. If our movement is thwarted, at least 100 members of our front will go on an indefinite hunger strike at Raj Ghat in Delhi and will make it a national movement,"" the statement said.

The front was floated by representatives of various sections of the society, including farmers, students, teachers and lawyers at its first meeting held on September 10.

The man instrumental in creating this front is the president of the Gujarat State University and College Teachers Association, KS Shastri, who is presently spearheading the workto-rule agitation of teachers.

Sources say Shastri, who has been known to take on the government on various occasions in regard to teachers'' issue, is planning to get various disgruntled groups under one roof and give the fight to the shape of the Navnirman movement triggered in 1974.

Incidentally, Shastri had joined the earlier Navnirman movement too as the president of the teachers'' association and seems to have emerged as the obvious choice as the leader of the front.

The focus of the convention will be the apathetic attitude of the government toward the plight of almost all major sections of the society.

""People have lost confidence in the government with 150 lakh small and big industrial units declared sick, at least 30 banks being closed down in the state.

Moreover, thousands of students, teachers, pensioners and farmers feel agitated even as government continues to turn a blind eye to the prevailing sentiment in the society,"" said members of the front in a statement.

""In the convention, we will decide the broad contours of the front and will decide strategies to make it permanent broad-based forum,"" Shastri said.

Following the convention in Ahmedabad, similar programmes will be held in Bhuj, Rajkot, Vadodara and Surat for which agenda will be thrashed on Sunday.

Sources say Shastri is banking heavily on the success of this convention, with the teachers'' agitation slowly losing steam even as government has begun taking strict measures such as arresting a fasting member, imposing salary cuts and service breaks on agitating teachers.

1,Bumpy road ahead for state PSE disinvestment,"GANDHINAGAR: Despite the recent Cabinet nod to the process of disinvestment and restructuring state''s public sector enterprises (PSEs), there is still a lack of clarity in the government on how to go ahead and which ones should be prioritised.

Plans include having a technical set-up headed by a retired additional chief secretary advising on policy to be followed for PSE reforms and a non-governmental experts group identifying which ones to take up first.

An official document states, ""Under the public sector restructuring programme, the Gujarat government has decided to carry out financial and administrative restructuring of 10 PSEs. During 1997, under the technical assistance sanctioned by the Asian Development Bank, Picewaterhouse Cooper, USA, were appointed consultants and they had conducted a study of 10 PSEs and submitted reports on each of them.""

Government sources say now each of these reports would have to be re-examined before any step is taken towards their implementation.

A senior bureaucrat, however, insisted ""The recommendations are too old. All of them will have to be reworked by the new experts committee.""

The names that float around for ready disinvestment include several profit-making PSEs â€” Gujarat Narmada Valley Development Corporation, Gujarat Alkalies and Chemicals Ltd, Gujarat Petroleum Corporation Ltd and Gujarat Mineral Development Corporation.

Studies were carried out in the past for restructuring Gujarat Maritime Board (GMB), Gujarat Industrial Investment Corporation (GIIC), Gujarat State Road Transport Corporation (ST), Gujarat Industrial Development Corporation (GIDC) among others.

Yet, there has been virtually no progress on this.

For instance, the plan to turn the GMB into a regulatory authority, even while corporatising and privatising the 40-odd ports owned by it, has been lying idle with the government for the past four years.

The GIIC, which registered a nearly Rs 60 crore loss last year, has stopped functioning as a banking body for two-and-a-half years.

It just confines its activity to recovering its dues. After the govt refused about five years ago to sell the PSE to the ICICI on the ground that the value of each of its share was not Rs 15 but Rs 40, it has not been able to find even a buyer.

Currently, its chairman S K Shelat is toying with the idea of restructuring it with the IDBI help.

There have been recommendations to merge the GIIC, either with the Gujarat State Finance Corporation (GSFC), another lossmaking unit, or with the GIDC.

The GIDC is wary of taking over the GSFC because it''s a liability.

Officials say the need to reform the PSEs is urgent. Suffering a total loss of Rs 5,300 crore, they have become a liability.

Just one PSEâ€” Gujarat Tractors â€” has been privatised of the 24 that were identified in 1996.

Six have been closed down. The plans to disinvest GMDC, GSFC and GIIC reached half-way and flopped.

The Gujarat Agro-Industries Corporation Ltd has closed down six of its operating units. Four PSEs have been merged.

As for the other, things remain on paper, despite repeated reports and attempts in that direction.

2,V-C defers EC meet after protests,"LUCKNOW: Vice-chancellor of Chhatrapati Shahuji Maharaj Medical University (CSMMU) Prof Mahendra Bhandari was forced to defer the emergency meeting of the executive council on Saturday following protests by teachers.

The meeting was called to discuss the Nityanand Committee report on better pay packages to teachers and recommend it to the government. However, apprehending a complete ban on private practice after approval of the report, panicky teachers in a swift ''operation'' scuttled the efforts of the V-C, leaving him with no option but to adjourn the meeting indefinitely.

The emergency meeting was called on Saturday afternoon. The agenda and the copies of the Nityanand report were circulated among the members in the morning. Teachers got some hint from teacher members of the EC that although the report recommended pay package at par with SGPGI, it also prohibited private practice and made non-practising allowance (NPA) mandatory for teachers.

Furthermore, there were also reports that facing the selection committee was also to be mandatory for teachers for promotion and the service period for promotion was also increased. TNN

Teachers said they have asked the government to provide the option to private practice. However, they added that if they were forced to take NPA, they would not be able to bargain with the government in future.

Thinking on these lines, CSMMU teachers association president and general secretary reached the V-C office just before the meeting and asked the V-C to give them a copy of the report and allow an open discussion before tabling it in the EC.

When the V-C reportedly refused, they came out and contacted other teachers. Soon some retired teachers and other faculty members, who have been running a campaign against ban on private practice, assembled outside V-C''s office. Frantic phone calls from mobiles were made with SOS messages to other colleagues. Within 15 minutes, the group swelled to a crowd of over 60 teachers.

Standing outside the meeting room, teachers stopped every EC member requesting them not to approve the report.

All teacher members and retired teacher members agreed that there was no need of ''emergency'' to approve the report. ""As it concerns our future, we have the right to go through it,"" teachers said and it was decided that they would stage a walk out if the report was forced on them.

When asked to react to these developments, the V-C said he wanted to settle the issue of better pay package for the teachers as early as possible, but since they see no emergency in it, the meeting had been adjourned.

3,LUSU polls: Muscle power to the fore,"LUCKNOW: Brazen display of muscle and money power marked the nomination proceedings for the Lucknow University Students Union (LUSU) elections on Saturday. Rival groups openly fired in air, entered into clashes and student leaders splurged money on fancy processions with pomp and flourish.

As district administration and LU authorities preferred to remain mute spectators, every single provision of the election code of conduct was thrown to the winds. In all, 284 students, including 13 girls, filed nominations for 21 posts. Simultaneously, nominations for JNDC, BSNV and Vidyant Colleges were also held.

Since day scholars have shown no interest in the LUSU polls so far, thousands of ''supporters'' were collected from various parts of the city and brought into the state capital overnight for neighbouring districts like Bara Banki, Hardoi and Sitapur and as far as Gorakhpur, Ballia, Gonda and Meerut to become a part of the processions of the candidates.

Over 1,000 vehicles were pressed into service and every prominent candidate led a cavalcade of big four-wheelers, packed with supporters, many also on the foot, dancing to the beat of drums, spreading abeer and gulal, they escorted their ''student leader'' from hostels to the main campus for nomination.

While there is a ceiling of Rs 10,000 per candidate for elections, estimates say that over Rs 20 lakh were spent on Saturday alone on liquor, food, publicity material and taking vehicles on hire.

Some sitting and former MLAs, hailing from various political parties, and from petty to big criminals also took part in the processions. Nominations started peacefully and continued till around noon, when Samajwadi Party supporters along with former students union presidents, escorted by supporters and bodyguards carrying fire arms, entered the campus, despite prohibition.

It was free for all thereafter as barring the SFI, other organisations including the ABVP and the NSUI candidates as well as other independent and rebel candidates, too, brought in big processions. A trial of strength was seen as to who had biggest ''number'' in the procession. Deafening sloganeering and cacophony of drum beats was the highlight of the ABVP candidates, who came in a open mini truck. The big procession of Bajrangi Singh Bajju, the rebel ABVP candidate, forced the rivals to bite their finger nails.

Hostel grounds looked like ''rally venue'' where vehicles were parked in large numbers, tents were installed for the stay of supporters along with arrangements for food. Large number of nominations were mainly because of dummy candidates, which students put up to have extra polling agents in the booths on the election day.

While there were 44 nominations for the post of presidentship, 45 were for vice-president, 53 for general secretary, 22 for junior librarian, 51 nominations were for four seats of arts representatives, 16 for three science representatives, 22 for three seats of law representative, 13 for two seats of commerce representatives and seven for hostel representatives.

Keeping the tradition of education faculty alive, only one candidate filed nomination for a single seat of education representative. The student electorate is of around 27,000 students. Polling will be held on September 28.

4,UP govt may challenge Babri verdict,"KOLKATA: The Samajwadi Party would consult leaders of its coalition partners in Uttar Pradesh â€” Kalyan Singh and Ajit Singh â€” if the state government should appeal against the order of the special Rae Bareli court exonerating Deputy Prime Minister LK Advani of charges in the Babri mosque demolition case, Samajwadi Party national general secretary Amar Singh said here on Saturday.

It would have been easier for the UP government to take the decision had the Congress been a part of it, he said. But, the Congress had decided not to join the government now, Singh added.

Hailing the court order, he said it was a moral victory for his party as charges had been framed against senior leaders of the Sangh Parivar, including Union minister Murli Manohar Joshi. Among them was Uma Bharati, whom the BJP has projected as the future chief minister of Madhya Pradesh.

He made it clear that the UP government would not allow any attempt to construct temple at the disputed site at Ayodhya while referring to Vishwa Hindu Parishad''s threat in this regard. ""If anybody breaks the law, Mulayam Singh Yadav will take steps,"" he said.

A ""big development"" that had taken place,he said,was that the ice had melted between the Congress and SP. Explaining why his party did not have any reservation any longer that Sonia was a foreigner, he said Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had consulted Sonia on sending troops to Iraq, the Sankaracharya had been photographed with Vajpayee and Sonia on either side and the court had said she was not a foreigner.

""We too have changed our stand.""

5,Central ministers from Bihar working for state: Prasad,"PATNA: Union information and broadcasting minister Ravishankar Prasad claimed that all ministers of Bihar at the Centre were trying to ''improve'' the image of Bihar which had been created by RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav. He said this while inaugurating a road constructed from his MP fund near Anisabad on Saturday.

The minister stressed that whatever development was going on in Patna was solely due to the efforts of BJP MLAs and MPs. He expressed regret that relief and rescue measures for the flood victims was going on only on paper. He asserted that he was committed to development in Bihar.

Speaking on the occasion, BJP MLA Navin Kishore Prasad Sinha stressed that the development work undertaken by MLAs and MPs had limitations. ""Patna is flooded. But instead of taking steps, the RJD chief compares the flood as an achievment"", he remarked. He questioned the commitment of RJD government in the state towards development.

6,No development without reforms: World Bank,"NEW DELHI: World Bank warned India on Sunday that it would be unable to reduce poverty and improve human develoment by 2015 without socio-economic reforms percolating to the poor.

""Without major improvement in policy, most states in India will not be able to accomplish the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which calls for halving the global incidence of poverty and broad improvements in human development by 2015,"" it said in a report released.

The ''World Development Report 2004: Making Services Work for Poor People'' said improvement in human welfare will not occur unless poor receive wider access to affordable, better quality services in health, education, water, sanitation and electrification.

""Without such improvements in such services, freedom from illness and freedom from illiteracy -- two of the most important ways poor people can escape poverty -- will remain elusive to many,"" it said.

Commenting on the report, World Bank president James D Wolfensohn said ""too often, key services fail poor people -- in access, in quantity and in quality. Services work when they include all people. They work when we take a comprehensive view of development.""

The report illustrated ""shoddy services"" received by poor, citing a government-sponsored programme in Andhra Pradesh, saying the weaker section were supposed to get Rs 1,000 and 15 kg of rice for family planning operations but they get Rs 500 and 10 kg rice and make the poor run around for the rest.

""Much of the public spending never reaches poor people. In India, the richest fifth receives three times the curative care subsidy of the poorest,"" World Bank lead economist Jeffrey Hammer said.

Although Indian public sector runs almost 2,00,000 primary health facilities and 15,000 secondary and tertiary facilities, World Bank said ""wide public provisions does not always translate into substantial use.""

""In India, even with the huge organisation of public health facilities, the private sector accounts for 80 per cent of the out-patient treatments and almost 60 per cent of in-patient treatments,"" it said.

Citing low quality of health services in the country, World Bank said ""in India, the contamination of injection needles used by registered medical practitioners was alarmingly widespread.""

Moreover, it noted that districts with a higher proportion of lower castes and some religious groups have fewer doctors and nurses. ""Health outreach workers are less likely to visit lower-caste and poor households,"" it said.

Highlighting the poor quality of education, World Bank said ""in randon visits to 200 primary schools in India, investigators found no teaching activity in half of them.""

Giving an account of a school in North Bihar, the report said ""conditions can be horrific. Classrooms are close to disintegration. Six children were injured in three separate incidents when parts of the building fell down and even now there is acute danger of terminal collapse.""

Summing up the study on schools, World Bank said ""half the schools visited had no drinking water available.""

9,Ex-UP minister Tripathi arrested,"LUCKNOW: Curtains began to roll down on the Madhumita murder case with the arrest of former minister Amarmani Tripathi by the Central Bureau of Investigations (CBI) from his Lawrence Terrace residence in Hazratganj on Sunday evening.

The arrest came minutes after Amarmani Tripathi held a press conference targeting the media, charging them of exposing him to a biased media trial.

The arrest was made minutes after a DNA report confirmed that the feotus extracted from the body of Madhumita was that of Amarmani. Interestingly, Amarmani is being charged for murder, conspiracy, tampering evidence and fabricating false evidence to mislead investigators.

The Times of India had earlier stated in a report that verbal communication from the DNA expert in Hyderabad had confirmed Amarmani''s name. The report was however dismissed.

On Sunday evening, the CBI team first questioned Amarmani for nearly an hour before serving the arrest warrant. He was, for the last time, quizzed on his associates who were involved in the murder and on why he had been evading CBI calls since last one week.

The investigators said that the CBI was trying to speak to Amarmani for the last seven days. But the former minister had installed caller-IDs on all his landlines and was not taking the calls of the investigators.

Around 6 pm on Sunday, Amarmani called a press conference at his Lawrence Terrace house where he insisted that he was being dragged into the Madhumita murder case as a result of a deep rooted conspiracy.

Giving a clean chit to his wife Madhumani, the former minister in the erstwhile Mayawati cabinet had even held his wife ""Sati Savitri"" and denied any association with the crime.

""I cannot face my children and relatives because of the baseless reports being published in the media about my involvement in the murder case,"" he said putting a hapless expression on his face.

He even went to the extent of charging the media of creating an unnecessary hype which, he alleged, was a compelling factor for the CBI to grill him extensively though this was not needed.

As the 10-minute long press conference concluded at around 6:25 pm, a CBI team headed by deputy superintendent of police (DySPs) CBI T Balaji and Hari Shanker Singh, along with six of their subordinates, walked into the house.

After some quizzing, the CBI began the formalities of his arrest which ended at 8:40 pm following which, he was taken to the Newal Kishore Road office if the premier investigating agency in the state capital.

Sources said that apart from being charged of murder, he would also be booked for fabricating false evidence for his acts related to floating the theory of Madhumita''s November 2002 marriage with an IIT Kanpur student - Anuj Misra.

Sources said that the priest Ganga Narain Dixit (who went on record before a news channel) and the journalist of a local Hindi daily (who claimed that he had solemnised the marriage of Madhumita) and Anuj would be booked for fraud and creating false evidence.

This part of the investigation would also comprise the role of two police officers earlier posted in the state capital who had went out of their way to pick-up Anuj from IIT Kanpur and interrogate him, allegedly forcing him to admit his marriage with the poetess who was shot dead at her Paper Mill colony residence in Nishatganj area of the state capital on May 9 last.

10,No party role for Joshi: RSS,"NEW DELHI: Though loyalists of Murli Manohar Joshi would want an enlarged role for him in the BJP if his resignation from the Union cabinet is accepted, RSS leaders assert that the organisation has no alternate plans for him.

Senior Sangh leaders distanced the organisation from the speculation that certain BJP leaders are seeking to make Joshi the BJP president. RSS leaders denied that there is any move from their side to foist Joshi into the BJP leadership and also the new Ram temple agitation.

According to RSS spokesman Ram Madhav, ''''The RSS considers the Babri Masjid case a political case and, hence, no person has to relinquish public office or party post over this case.'''' However, Joshi loyalists claim that this is only the double-speak of the Sangh and that Joshi would soon emerge as the new face of Hindutva within the Parivar. They feel that though PM Vajpayee and Deputy PM L K Advani would not want a rival power centre, Joshi cannot be stopped now from getting into organisational work.

''''In the run-up to the parliamentary elections next year, Joshi as the mascot for the Parivar politics could only do good for the organisation. After all, he is one minister who has performed the best in terms of implementing Sangh policies,'''' said a Joshi supporter within the party.

Yet, the Sangh seems to have left it to the BJP and the PM to accept or reject Joshi''s resignation. The Rae Bareli special court''s orders, according to the RSS, have not made any drastic changes in the Sangh''s immediate plans for the BJP and its leadership. Some Parivar leaders even claim that the PM was not very happy with Joshi''s decision to resign without consulting him or other Parivar leaders.

12,Police lathi-charge ‘Navnirman’ protestors,"AHMEDABAD: Over 200 protestors of the Maha Gujarat Navnirman Front and its president Prof K S Shastri were arrested after here on Sunday after the police, which had banned their rally, cracked down on them using batons and tear gas.

Thousands for agitating teachers, lawyers, farmers and doctors from different parts of the state had come to the city on Sunday to attend a public gathering at the Akashganga ground.

The teachersâ€™ protest under the leadership of K S Shastri, former vice-chancellor of Gujarat University, was aimed at airing their grievances against the Narendra Modi government and its â€œfailure on various frontsâ€�.

However, before they could gather, the police resorted to lathi-charge and also burst tear gas shells. Large contingents of policemen guarded various approach roads to the Akashganga ground, indicating that there were clear instructions from the government to foil the protest which aims to replicate the tumultuous â€˜Navnirmanâ€™ mass movement in 1974 which led to the ouster of then Chimanbhai Patel government.

The police ensured that most protestors did not reach the ground, and those who did were promptly dispersed and arrested, their mikes and other equipment confiscated.

Following a minor incident of stone-pelting from a nearby housing colony, the police intensified their attack on the protestors and even fired tear gas shells to disperse them. Prof Shastri, who heads the college and university teachers association of the state, and many leaders were arrested before they could address the gathering.

â€œThis is undemocratic. They employed goons to lathi-charge us, even the women teachers were not spared. The policemen physically pushed many women and were uttering abuses,â€� said Prof Sujata Joshi. Some even alleged that those who were lathi-charging the protestors were not policemen but VHP and Bajrang Dal activists.

â€œThe Modi government has resorted to state terrorism. This was a gathering of teachers, not terrorists, but the police lathicharged them. We have a right to protest, and not allowing us to hold a convention is undemocratic,â€� said M S Trivedi, who was one of the 10 teachers who were on a relay fast at the university.

Prof Shastri later addressed teachers at Sardar Patel Stadium and said they now plan to intensify their stir. â€œWe take a serious note of the police action on us. This is akin to state terrorism.â€�

He said the plan now would be to approach the President of India and hold a series of demonstrations in Delhi. There would be 5,000 affidavits that would be submitted to the Supreme Court to highlight the state terrorism unleashed here on peaceful protestors, he said.

On Tuesday, all colleges have been asked to remain closed and a special meeting of trade unions and voluntary organisation would be held at Town Hall in Ahmedabad.

After they were chased away from Sola, many protestors gathered near the university where they raised anti-Modi slogans.

Additional commissioner of police P C Thakur said the teachers were arrested as they were not given permission to hold the meeting. The arrest was under section IPC 188, he said.
