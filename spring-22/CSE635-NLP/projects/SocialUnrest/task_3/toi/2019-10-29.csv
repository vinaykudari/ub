0,Mishra hails Sonia's decision on J&K govt,"PATNA: Nationalist Congress Party leader Jagannath Mishra has hailed Congress president Sonia Gandhi for her decision to appoint PDP leader Mufti Mohammed Sayeed as chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir rising above party considerations and in the national interest.

He said that to reach an accord on a common minimum programme with the PDP was in accordance with the glorious tradition of the Congress party.

Mishra said that this reminds us how in 1975 then Congress chief Indira Gandhi had appointed National Conference (NC) leader Sheikh Abdullah as Jammu and Kashmir chief minister after removing Congress leader Mir Qasim from the CM post under an agreement reached between the two parties.

Though the NC had not even a single member in the state assembly, the Congress had two-third majority, he informed. In a similar fashion former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi under an agreement handed over power to Akali Dal leader Harcharan Singh Longowal in Punjab and also had agreed to dissolve the Assam assembly where the Congress party had three-fourth majority under an agreement with the Assam Gan Parishad.

Mishra said that this action of Sonia Gandhi would send a positive signal to the other parties in the country to think in the right direction and also help the terrorist forces to join the mainstream of the society.

1,MLA contests development fund figures,"NEW DELHI: The statistics collated by the Delhi state urban development department on the constituency development funds spent by city legislators in last two years have been contested by Delhi Cantonment member of legislative assembly Kiran Chaudhury.

In a letter to state chief minister Sheila Dikshit, Chaudhury said she had spent the entire amount that was allocated to her under the constituency development fund last year.

""However, the figures released by the state urban development department do not give a correct picture and need to be corrected,"" she wrote.

According to the statistics released by state urban development department, Chaudhury had spent only Rs 59 lakh last year from Rs 2 crore that was allocated to her.

Chaudhury said she had determined schemes worth Rs 1.90 crore for last year. She had proposed to spend Rs 90 lakh on development activities to be undertaken through Delhi Cantonment Board.

She had also proposed to spend Rs 89 lakh through the Delhi municipal corporation and Rs 10 lakh through the erstwhile Delhi Vidyut Board.

Chaudhury said through the three agencies, she was able to spend the entire amount allocated to her.

According to her, a major portion of her MLA fund was spent on developing parks, setting up tubewells, improvement of drains and roads in her constituency.

2,Conduct of elections could cost Rs 40 cr,"GANDHINAGAR: In view of the communal disturbances that rocked the state, the Election Commission of India has decided to make elaborate security arrangements for the assembly elections scheduled for December 12.

At least 1,00,000 securitymen, including State Reserve Police and other para-military forces will be deployed to maintain law and order, during elections. The commission has decided to despatch as many as 90 observers to oversee the elections.

Talking to mediapersons, Chief Electoral Officer Gurucharan Singh said the number of voters in Gujarat has swelled to 3.29 crore at the end of special revision of electoral rolls conducted by the commission, after visit of the Chief Election Commissioner J M Lyngdoh.

Singh said as compared to 35,000 polling booths set up in last assembly elections, the commission has plans to set up 38,000 polling booths which would be managed by 1.8 lakh election staff.

This is for the first time that electronic voting machines (EVMs) would be used in all the booths in the state. More than 45,000 EVMs have already been procured. The commission has also sent 5,000 EVMs as stand by which could be used in case of technical snags.

The state government has sanctioned a budget of over Rs 40 crore for arrangements to be made for assembly elections. Giving details of the code of conduct Singh said the state government would not be able to make any announcement aimed at influencing or luring voters.

At the same time the government would not be allowed to spend money from the government grant and discretionary funds.

""The code also prohibits the government from inaugurating or laying foundation for any project as also announcing or making promises regarding new projects.""

Neither the state minister or central ministers can undertake visits to their constituencies using official machinery and vehicles.

To a question whether the Gaurav Yatra would be stopped following enforcement of code of conduct, Singh said the yatra was a campaign of the party, but expenditure on it would surely be subjected to the code and the BJP would have to submit it as election expenditure.

Besides the state government, all political parties participating in the election, contesting candidates, local self-government bodies, statutory boards and corporations and all bodies run on government aid and co-operatives will have to follow the code of conduct.

As per the guidelines no new recruitment will be allowed in government services or in any of the corporations and boards. The ministers would not allow use of their official cars till the election process is over.

They should also not travel by government aircraft or mechanised boats for the purpose of electioneering. The ministers will not be treated as official guests for lodging and boarding in government guest houses till election process is completed.

In case if they wished to avail this facility they will have to pay the commercial charges for their stay and the food. Neither can they hold any meeting with the officials. The officials in the districts are not supposed to meet the ministers coming from Gandhinagar, New Delhi or other places.

3,Telecom stir costs govt Rs 30 cr a day,"NEW DELHI: Having problems calling up neighbouring cities or major metros? Have cellphone numbers become difficult to get from land lines? Has the dial-up Net connection behaving erratically for the last few days?

You are not alone in your suffering. The government too is losing huge amounts daily from a countrywide disruption in telecom services in the wake of work-to-rule by BSNL and MTNL engineers.

The agitation by about 40,000 government telecom engineers have also affected the railway and air reservations as well as lease lines, giving corporates a tough time in transfering data.

The engineers estimated that BSNL would be losing Rs 20-25 crore daily and MTNL Rs 4-5 crore a day. This means that in the six days that the agitation has been on, BSNL has lost anything up to Rs 120-150 crore and MTNL Rs 24-30 crore. This is expected to worsen as the engineers have threatened to intensify their stir as neither the DoT nor the telecom PSUs have so far invited them for talks.

BSNL Executive Association general secretary G L Jogi said they were seeking industrial dearness allowance (IDA) for those who opted to join the two PSUs as per the Rakesh Mohan Committee report. At present these executives are getting a lower Central DA (CDA) as DoT employees on deputation.

""We do not want the people to suffer. But we must get a fair deal and cannot be discrimainated against because we have opted to serve the PSUs,"" Jogi said.

Their other demands include pension for those who opted to join the two PSUs, benefit of IDA for those who retired in the transition period, time-bound promotion and service weightage.

""It would not have come to this had communications minister Pramod Mahajan been around. On earlier occasions, he has invited us for talks on smaller matters as he did not want consumers to suffer,"" one office-bearer of the apex panel spearheading the agitation said. Mahajan has been in Italy on official business.

4,"SGPC polls: SSF serves legal notice on Centre, state","LUDHIANA: The Sehajdhari Sikh Federation on Monday served a legal notice on the central and state authorities against conducting the SGPC presidential and executive committee elections slated for November 12 without first conducting the elections to the general house, the term for which had expired a year ago.

The SSF has decided to initiate legal proceedings if the authorities concerned fail to respond within seven days of the notice.

According to the notice served to the union home ministry, the Punjab chief secretary, the chief commissioner (gurdwara elections) and the SGPC president, the SSF, through its counsel, contended that the members of the committee managing the affairs of Sikh religious places should have stepped down in October 2001 after the expiry of its five-year term.

But since the then Akali government had a very strong presence in the general house, getting repeated extensions for holding fresh general house elections suited their interests, alleged the SSF.

It further alleged that since the continuation of the present body in office was sought by misusing the provisions of section 51 of the Sikh Gurdwara Act, the state government abdicated its duty of fixing the date for fresh general elections, as under section 47 of the Act.

Repeated extensions had been allowed by the government, which amounted to abusing the Act, the petitioner alleged.

SSF said that misusing the relevant provisions and taking recourse to sections 62 and 63 of the Act to justify the continuation of the present committee was illegal.

5,2-3 lakh SAD workers to court arrest: Badal,"GIDDERBAHA: Former Punjab chief minister and Shiromani Akali Dal SAD) president Parkash Singh Badal, on Monday, gave a clarion call to party leaders and workers all over the state to launch a ''jail bharo'' agitation on November 15.

Addressing party workers at protest rallies held in Gidderbaha and Malout, Badal and his nephew Manpreet Badal called upon party workers to mobilise at least 20 to 30 workers from each village to court arrest on November 15.

""Anything between two to three lakh party members will fill jails on that day,"" claimed the SAD chief.

""With all modes of redressing a wrong having failed, raising of swords is just and pious,"" declared Manpreet Badal, quoting Guru Gobind Singh.

Unsparing in his criticism of the Amarinder Singh government, the former chief minister said, ""Enough is enough. Our patience has been exhausted. We will not let the people of Punjab suffer anymore under the dictatorship of Amarinder Singh.""

Badal said that Amarinder had nothing on his agenda except harassing Akali leaders.

""We served on Amarinder many ultimatums asking him to give up his anti-people policies, but he did not bother. So we have now decided not to rest till he is overthrown,"" he said.

Badal ridiculed Amarinder, saying, ""He is the most comfort-loving chief minister Punjab has ever got. Under the influence of liquor, which he was served by the Rajasthan chief minister, Amarinder ordered his government to release 1,000 cusecs of water to Rajasthan, and that too at a time when farmers in Punjab were facing an acute water shortage.""

Asking party workers to call Amarinder ''dukh mantri'' (misery minister) rather than ''mukh mantri'' (chief minister), Badal''s son and Member of Parliament Sukhbir Badal said, ""He has brought the state only misery during his eight-month tenure.""

Accusing Amarinder of misusing the police to terrorise SGPC members and their families, Badal said that the SAD (B) was forced to take them out of the state as the state machinery in Punjab was bent upon ""rigging"" the SGPC polls.

""His one-point agenda of vengeance has deprived the state of all development. He has withdrawn all pro-people programmes of the previous government, including free power and irrigation for farmers and the shagun and pension schemes. By interfering in the religious affairs of the Sikhs, the chief minister is driving the state towards militancy,"" he added.

6,Modi makes GEB increase power supply to farmers,"VADODARA: The GEB has increased the number of hours of three phase power supply to the farming sector in the state, following Chief Minister Narendra Modiâ€™s instructions, according to GEB sources.

The three phase supply of power to the farming sector has been increased from eight hours to ten hours per day. However, the GEB has resorted to 4-5 hours of load shedding in the rural areas, as it has been facing a serious problem of capacity shortage.

With elections around the corner and increase in demand of power from the farming sector, the chief minister had convened a meeting of high-ranking GEB officials, in Gandhinagar last week, to assess the situation on the power front.

The meeting was also attended by state minister for energy Kaushik Patel.

7,Narlikar convinced ET very much out there,"PUNE: Is there life, other than us, out there in the vast expanse of the cosmos? The question has eternally fascinated man. But, if results of recent experiments conducted by Indian scientists are anything to go by, then extra-terrestrial (ET) life may very much turn out to be a reality.

This was revealed on Friday by astrophysicist Jayant Narlikar, who supervised the experiments last year.

Narlikar was delivering a lecture - Searches for extra-terrestrial life - at the Inter University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics.

Narlikar said there was circumstantial evidence to support the idea of life beyond earth. Millimetre wave astronomy had revealed the existence of both organic and inorganic molecules in space, he said.

Over the decades, scientists have been weighing options of sending unmanned spaceships to seek out ET life. ""Sending radio messages (with information about us) turned out to be the most practical one, but it required immense patience,"" Narlikar said.

Fred Hoyle and Wickremasinghe propounded the theory that comets could have been the carriers which delivered micro-organisms in frozen state on earth. ""The Cryosampler Experiment conducted in collaboration with the ISRO last January was a fallout of this theory,"" said Narlikar.

He said a balloon carrying a cryosampler with 16 sterilised probes was sent to a height of 41 km into the atmosphere from the TIFR Balloon facility in Hyderabad. The probes sucked air at four different heights which were filtered and later tested at laboratories.

""Some bacteria were found in the air samples. These were not common contaminants. Nor had they been used in the laboratory where the test was conducted. Moreover, no such growth was found on control membranes that were not exposed to the air samples,"" he said.

""If these micro-organisms are not from earth, had we intercepted extra-terrestrial life?"" Narlikar wondered. Further work is in progress.

8,Lawyers hail SC judgment on Gujarat polls,"NEW DELHI: Though they argued from opposing sides on the issues raised by the Presidential reference on Gujarat elections, Arun Jaitley and Kapil Sibal on Monday welcomed the Supreme Court ruling. But both had different reasons.

""The Supreme Court has settled all questions relating to the Election Commission''s jurisdiction to defer elections,"" said former law minister Jaitley and counsel for the aggrieved Gujarat government.

Jaitley, who had argued that elections must be held within six months of the last session of the House, said ""it is a welcome judgment in so far as it ensures holding of elections with regularity and eliminates discretion"" in deferring elections on the grounds of law and order.

Jaitley was referring to the EC''s decision to hold elections in J&K, despite a grave law and order situation there, and defer elections in Gujarat on the same grounds.

Maintaining that Monday''s verdict has vindicated ""our stand"", Congress counsel Sibal said the judgment had rejected the contentions of the EC, the Centre and the Gujarat government on the interpretation of Article 174(1) of the Constitution.

Laudably, Sibal said, the court has reiterated that not only democracy or free and fair polls but periodic polls were the basic feature of the Constitution. Bihar''s lawyer and former law minister Ram Jethmalani has already said: ""Article 174 applies to the assembly whose personality or identity is not interrupted and altered by expiry of its period of duration or premature dissolution.""

Jethmalani had argued: ""The case of the Union and the BJP is based on the belief that any sham assembly is better than no assembly"".

9,Bhagalpur riot wounds continue to fester,"BHAGALPUR: This city, it is said, is burdened too much with history and by too many people who canâ€™t remember the past. But, the witnesses turning hostile and consequent acquittals during the past 13 years have more or less compelled the families of the victims of infamous Bhagalpur riots, to walk down the nightmare lane of traumatic communal violence.

According to official information, nearly 2,000 people, mostly Muslims, were butchered in several villages during the communal riots here in 1989, which reportedly broke out during the ""shila pujan"" procession. Nearly 700 cases relating to it were registered at the different police stations of the district.

A few of the cases were even referred for intelligence probe. But, surprisingly, most of the cases have remained confined to files.

Take this: at Longain, more than one hundred people were massacred and later, the gory killers buried them in a field and planted vegetables over them. The files of these cases have not reportedly been opened as yet. All the Muslim families, except one of Bideshi Mian, who were residing before the riots here, have left the place.

Interestingly, the children of neighbouring Tarchha village call it ""Bhutaha Gaon"" (ghost village). The court here has also convicted many persons during the past 13 years. But their number appears to be marginal in comparison to those who were acquitted by the different courts, reportedly due to lack of substantial evidence.

At Chanderi, as many as 61 persons were murdered during the riots. Police records say that 38 persons were chargesheeted in this connection. But, the court convicted only 16 of them, while the other 22 were released due to discrepancy in the statements of witnesses. And, perhaps, it is due to the justice delayed that the horrific memories, that the victims try to hold during the day here, stalk them in their sleep.

Meet Malika Begum of Chanderi. She was nearly 14 when the mob of Hindus killed her parents, chopped off her right leg and threw her in a nearby pond. But, a Muslim youth, who appeared a sympathiser, proved much worse. Mohd Taaj married Malika, but later fled away with the money that Malika had received as compensation.

The handicapped girl has no option other than working as a labourer. ""For the last 13 years, I have been living in an atmosphere of hatred, anger and threat,"" says Malika, who is, incidentally, a witness in the riot case.

The victims as well as social workers squarely blame the district administration and the government for unfair compensation, poor rehabilitation, political conspiracies, and frustrated lives abound.

Farooq Ali, a zoology teacher of Tilka Manjhi Bhagalpur University and a social worker says, ""The administration has failed to restore the social fabric of the city. Its lapses have so far caused nothing more than skepticism and ire.""

Giving the examples of localities like Parbatti, Chanderi and Noorpur, he also condemned the approach of both Hindus and Muslims, for the unnecessary drift of population towards particular areas in which they think themselves to be dominant. ""The drift has badly affected the silk industry in Bhagalpur,"" he adds.

Rakesh Kumar Mishra, senior superintendent of police of Bhagalpur, does not agree that the communal hatred was still present in the district. ""With the dark scars and hard lessons of the past, the people here now know that harmony is the best thing,"" he said.

10,Three Cong ministers want to quit RJD govt,"PATNA: Three junior Bihar ministers, all belonging to the Congress and hailing from minority community, on Monday sought partyâ€™s permission to resign from their posts.

They are junior minister for science and technology Chaudhary Mehboob Ali Kaiser, junior minister of relief and rehabilitation Mohammad Jahidur Rehman and junior minister for labour and employment Mohammad Javed.

On Monday, they called on BPCC president and medical education minister Shakeel Ahmad and sought permission to quit their posts. Ahmad forwarded their joint letter to the AICC president through in-charge of Bihar, Oscar Fernandes. Ahmad later apprised RJD supremo Laloo Yadav and CM Rabri Devi of the development.

Interestingly, Congress Legislature Party leader and registration minister Vijay Shankar Dubey claimed that he came to know of the development through the media. Replying to a query, Dubey admitted that the three junior ministers were feeling unhappy with the treatment meted out to them by the RJD. The BPCC president, however, sought to play down the issue, saying he was holding discussions with the three to sort out the issue.

BPCC sources said that the three ministers were sulking for the past several months as they felt that they had been given insignificant portfolios. While Javed is the son of former Congress minister Mohammad Hussain Azad, Kaiser is the son of former Congress minister Chaudhary Mohammad Salauddin.

A section of the party felt that the development was orchestrated as the three ministers were considered close to Ahmad. They felt that the development was nothing but an attempt by Ahmad to impress upon the party high command that he was the only leader who could tackle such crisis.

The party dissidents, it may be recalled, have been demanding the removal of Ahmad from the party post to uphold the principle of one man one post.

Some senior Congressmen said that with Sonia Gandhi in no mood to withdraw support to the Rabri government, the resignation drama was bound to fizzle out.

11,"CPM demands Rs 4,000 per acre for drought-hit farmers","KURNOOL: CPM demanded the government to pay a compensation of Rs 4,000 per acre to drought-hit farmers.

The party activists held a dharna in front of the Kurnool collectorate on Monday, demanding the government to extend all possible help to farmers and agriculture labourers. Addressing the activists, CPM state secretariat member M A Gaffoor alleged that the government was indifferent to helping farmers, who lost entire crops.

He also demanded waiver of the crop loans of small farmers and waiver of interest on crop loans of all farmers. Irrespective of payment of old loans, new loans should be advanced to farmers, he demanded.

CPM Kurnool district secretary T Shadrak demanded the government to take up Food-for-Work programme in all parts of the district to provide work to farm labour, who were devoid of work.

He said that there are about eight lakh agriculture labourers in the district and of them more than 75 per cent are affected due to drought. He demanded the government to pay drought pensions, including 20 kg of rice and Rs 500 per month to families.

Rythu Sangham Kurnool district president T Narasimhaiah demanded completion of all pending irrigation projects like Telugu Ganga, Srisailam Right Bank Canal (SRBC) and KC canal modernisation. He felt that the projects would help farmers to get sufficient water for crops. He said that due to prolonged dry spells, paddy had withered under KC canal and LLC.

The government should take necessary steps to control price of rice in the coming days as there would be great demand for paddy.

13,Bihar govt plans to modernise jails,"PATNA: Following strong observation of the National Human Rights Commission on poor condition of jails across the state, the Bihar government has prepared a five-year perspective plan for jail modernisation and sought status reports from the jail superintendents on sanitation, medical facilities and food standards for the inmates.

Under the plan a total sum of Rs 90 crore would be spent over the next five years on construction of new jail buildings, repair of the dilapidated ones and improving civic amenities for the inmates, Inspector General (prisons) Ravi Kant said.

He said state government has already approved Rs 12.78 crore for the purpose and a sum of Rs 62.9 crore is expected to come from the Central government as part of the scheme for jail modernisation. The gap would be covered by mobilising resources from the state government sources, he added.

The IG (prisons) said that overcrowding was the main problem in all the 54 jails across the state. Against a capacity of about 21,000 the number of prisoners lodged in different prisons of the state presently is about 38,000. Unless overcrowding in the jails is reduced, no reform can produce the desired result, he added.

Kant said he has written to all the jail superintendents to send status report about available medicare facilities, sanitation and food quality.

18,Giriraj Kishore asks govt to withdraw security,"NEW DELHI: In yet another jolt to ties between Sangh Parivar and the BJP-led NDA government, an angry VHP leader Acharya Giriraj Kishore has asked the Union home ministry to withdraw his ""inadequate"" personal security cover as it was ""deliberately"" ignoring threats to his life.

In a strongly-worded letter to the Union home secretary, the VHP senior vice-president said that the ''Y'' category security provided to him earlier had now been scaled down to ''X'' category.

Claiming that he had received several threatening letters, which he submitted to the officials concerned through his personal security officer, Kishore said ""under ''X'' category, no security is provided to me during my overnight stays at places outside Delhi.""

He pointed out that no security personnel accompanied him if he happened to go by plane and return by train.

Reminding the home secretary that he had made several requests to enhance his security cover, he said that while for sometime wherever he went some persons were sent, but many a time no security personnel were sent despite intimations about his itinerary.

In the recent past, several Pak-trained militants have been arrested in the capital and elsewhere in the country and charged with planning to assassinate senior Sangh Parivar leaders, including Kishore, VHP supremo Ashok Singhal and secretary general Praveen Togadia.

Kishore''s demand for deletion of portions ""preaching hatred against other communities"" from the Holy Koran had sparked off country-wide protests, including a ''Bandh'' in Kashmir Valley.

In his letter, the VHP leader said that due to the ""deliberate heedless behaviour, I have come to the conclusion that your security department feels I am secure with this meagre security cover. I, therefore, wish to submit that please take away this so-called security cover and leave me to God''s mercy.""

The VHP leader also warned that ""for any untoward happening, the government and their security department would be responsible.""

Relations between the Sangh Parivar and the BJP had touched a low ebb lately with the RSS opposing the overnment''s economic policies, including disinvestment and foreign direct investment and the VHP charging it with failure in tackling terrorism and in solving the vexed Ayodhya issue.

BJP chief Venkaiah Naidu also charged VHP with toeing a line identical to the one pursued by extremist forces from across the border.

Last week, top BJP and RSS brass met over dinner at Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee''s residence and agreed to respect each other''s views and avoid public criticism.

It was also agreed that BJP would be holding talks with other parivar organisations.

20,NDA govt's lust for power has led to scams: Sonia,"VARANASI: Launching a scathing attack on the NDA government at the Centre and the Mayawati government, Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Tuesday said that their lust for power had resulted in rampant corruption, scams and atrocities on the poor and downtrodden in the country.

Addressing party workers as part of her direct interaction programme here, Gandhi said that the developmental activities had taken a back seat and unemployment had risen in the NDA regime.

Attacking the BJP, she said that it was perturbed over the rising popularity of the Congress and was now trying to incite communal hatred in the country as was witnessed in Gujarat recently.

Praising the performance of the Congress governments in several states, Gandhi said that the people''s faith in the party had grown over the years.

Admitting there was groupism in the party, especially in its Uttar Pradesh unit, she appealed to the party workers to shun differences and work for enhancing the support base of Congress.

She further said that groupism prevailing in the party had not only damaged it but had also provided a chance to the fundamentalist forces to raise their head.

Senior Congress leaders, including, AICC treasurer Motilal Vora, former chief minister Ram Naresh Yadav and UPCC president Arun Kumar Singh Munna were present on the occasion.

21,UK calls for Indian investment in IT sector,"NEW DELHI: The UK on Tuesday called for greater Indian investment in the IT sector and said the Indian companies should use the country as a gateway to Europe.

""The Indian IT companies are doing well in the UK and our country can be used by the Indian companies as a gateway to Europe,"" Britain''s Minister of State for E-Commerce Stephen Timms said addressing a seminar on ''Communications: The Catalyst for Economic Growth'', organised by Ficci.

22,BJP trying to incite communal hatred: Sonia,"VARANASI: Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Tuesday said that the BJP, worried over by ""rising"" popularity of her party, was trying to incite communal hatred in the country in the pattern of what was witnessed in Gujarat.

Addressing party workers as part of her campaign to revive the party in Uttar Pradesh, Gandhi said that developmental activities across the country had taken a back seat and unemployment risen during the reign of BJP-led NDA government at the Centre.

Launching a scathing attack on BJP, she said that it was ""perturbed"" over the ""rising popularity"" of Congress and ""is now trying to incite communal hatred in the country as was witnessed in Gujarat recently.""

Admitting that there was groupism in Congress, especially in its Uttar Pradesh unit, the AICC president said that this had not only damaged the party but also provided a chance to fundamentalist forces to raise their head.

She appealed to party workers to shun differences and work for enhancing the support base of Congress.

Commending the performance of Congress governments in several states, Gandhi said ""the people''s faith in the party has grown over the years.""

Senior Congress leaders, including AICC treasurer Motilal Vora, former chief minister Ram Naresh Yadav and UPCC president Arun Kumar Singh Munna were present on the occasion.

23,Blacklisted company gets govt contract,"NEW DELHI: To construct a Rs 23-crore traffic underpass at Pitampura, the Delhi state government has awarded the contract to a private firm which was blacklisted by the state public works department (PWD) for delaying work on its three flyovers.

Afcons, a private construction firm, was recently engaged by Delhi Tourism and Transport Development Corporation (DTTDC) for construction of a half-kilometre-long underpass at Pitampura. An expert committee under Lieutenant-Governor (L-G) Vijai Kapoor that clears contracts for all major capital works undertaken by the state government, awarded work to this private firm.

However, about three months back, PWD minister A K Walia had written to all construction agencies, including DDA, not to award work to Afcons or any other firm that had a poor past record of not completing work on time. PWD itself faced a cost escalation of 20 per cent due to Afconsâ€™ failure to complete construction of three of its flyovers.

The South Extension flyover, that was opened two months back, was delayed by Afcons by almost 15 months. Similarly, PWD flyovers at Punjabi Bagh and Mayapuri, which were out sourced to Afcons, are running one year behind schedule.

Tourism and transport minister Ajay Maken said the decision to award the contract to Afcons was not taken by DTTDC. â€˜â€˜A six-member committee of technical experts which works under the L-G took the decision to award the contract to Afcons. DTTDC had no role to play,â€™â€™ he said.

DTTDC is responsible for funding and monitoring the underpass.

24,Blended petrol to rule the roads from next year,"BANGALORE: Concerned over the increasing air pollution levels, the Centre has made it compulsory for eight states, including Karnataka, to blend petrol with ethanol. The move, aimed at reducing environmental pollution, will come into effect from January 1, 2003.

Ethanol is a high octane liquid renewable fuel and is produced by fermenting plant sugars. It reduces harmful hydrocarbon and benzene emissions, thereby reducing air pollution. Ethanol also improves combustion efficiency.

The environment and forest ministry has sent a circular to the states directing them to encourage sugar industries and distilleries to augment their ethanol production capacity.

With only two months left to implement the directive, the state government has begun discussions with oil companies to create the infrastructure for producing ethanol. ""We need to float tenders to identify companies authorised to sell ethanol. The present production may not suffice, though the percentage of ethanol in petrol is fixed at 5 per cent. It will gradually be raised to 10 per cent,"" official sources told The Times of India.

The environment ministry has decided to take up the ethanol blending in petrol in two phases. The first phase which will come into effect from 2003 has been taken up in major sugar producing states -- Andhra Pradesh, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Punjab, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh and the Union territories of Chandigarh, Daman and Diu, Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Pondicherry. ""We have built up the availability of ethanol before making it compulsory throughout the country. The second phase will target the remaining regions in the country,"" sources said.

To facilitate states to implement the direction, the environment ministry has notified the Regulation of Supply and Distribution and the Prevention of Malpractice Control Order, 2002. The blended fuel called gasohol will be supplied through 11,538 retail outlets in these states and UTs, sources said.

Meanwhile, the total petrol consumption in these states and Union territories was over 4.6 million tons in 2001-2002. At this level, the estimated ethanol required for blending with petrol would be approximately 32 to 35 crore litres per year.

The first pilot project to blend fuels was taken up at Miraj-Hazarwadi depot in Maharashtra in April last year. ""These projects confirmed the suitability of the use of gasohol fuel in vehicles, without any modification as also its potential to reduce environmental pollution on account of its oxygenate quality,"" experts pointed out.

25,"Farmers violate ban orders, stage protest","MANDYA: Peace was restored in Mandya following some tension and a few untoward incidents during a dharna in front of the DC''s office on Tuesday.

Over 2,000 farmers held a peaceful dharna to protest police `atrocities'' on Monday.

The protests will be intensified on Wednesday, farmer leaders said. Fourteen persons including MLA M.S. Athmananda and MLC M.S. Siddaraju will stage an indefinite fast at the Silver Jubilee Park till water from Cauvery was stopped to Tamil Nadu. A bandh call has been given at Mandya in all six taluk headquarters and hoblis. Farmers have been urged to gather in their respective taluk centres with bullock carts, cattle and animal stock to violate the prohibitory orders.

On Tuesday morning, despite the police cordon in almost all villages, over 3,000 farmers assembled at the SJ Park.

Most of the farmers were armed with sticks, bicycle chains and chilli powder. However, they were persuaded to take out a peaceful procession to the DC''s office by president of Zilla Raitha Hitharakshana Samithi president G. Madegowda. Tension prevailed till the farmers reached the DC''s office.

The protesters forced shops and business establishments to down their shutters on their way to the DC''s office. However, they remained calm and staged a dharna till 5 pm.

Madegowda said Chief Minister S.M. Krishna was misusing administrative machinery and police force to foil the agitation. Prohibitory orders were violated as thousands of farmers assembled to stage a dharna. However, the police did not arrest anyone. Over one lakh farmers would have gathered if the police had not blocked roads and warned them of dire consequences if they travelled to Mandya.

Let''s share distress: Mandya Cong

The Mandya District Congress Committee on Tuesday urged the farmers to exercise restraint and not be swayed by vested interests trying to stoke up emotions.

In a press release, DCC president and MLA L.R. Shivarame Gowda said the State government had decided against releasing water when the water level in KRS was 10 tmcft below normal. ``The situation improved later on with rain, but people and the government have to carefully introspect about the Supreme Court''s observations,'''' he said.

Gowda said the present storage level was not abundant but was enough for small releases to Tamil Nadu after taking care of the standing crops and drinking water purposes. ``In such a scenario, we should share our distress,'''' he said.

Gowda pointed out that the situation was still delicate and that any emotional response would harm the interests of the State. ``Sharing of waters should be be decided calmly and based on ground realities. This is also in keeping with our culture,'''' he added.

26,"PMC announces Rs 2 crore increase in ex-gratia, bonus","PUNE: The Pune municipal corporation (PMC) has decided to shell out Rs 14.5 crore as Diwali bonus and ex-gratia to 17,000 employees, notwithstanding the projected revenue deficit of Rs 115 crore in the current financial year.

The minimum bonus and ex-gratia amount that class IV employees, such as sweepers, will take home will be around Rs 7,000,while for top officials, the amount may cross Rs 20,000.

In addition, the PMC will be spend Rs 4 crore on bonus and ex-gratia for 3,300 municipal school board workers and around Rs 5 crore for the 7,500 Pune municipal transport (PMT) employees.

The total amount on bonus and ex-gratia will thus be around Rs 23.5 crore, Rs 2 crore more than in 2001.

The PMC employees union has withdrawn its proposed strike and plans to call on chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh since their demands have been met.

The joint meeting of the union leaders, PMC party leaders and civic officials on Monday resolved to grant an ex-gratia of Rs 3,500 to each worker, in addition to a bonus of 8.33 per cent on the revised scales.

The union had demanded an ex-gratia of Rs 4,000, a raise of Rs 250 as compared with the ex-gratia of Rs 3,750 in 2001.

However, the administration and party leaders lowered the ex-gratia amount by Rs 250. The workers agreed to the reduction as, in the bargain, they have been offered a 8.33 per cent bonus on â€œrevised pay scalesâ€�.

In 2001, the 8.33 per cent bonus was accorded on the old pay scales, prior to the implementation of the fifth pay commission recommendations.

The meeting also decided to grant an equal bonus (8.33 per cent on revised scales) and ex-gratia of Rs 3, 500 to PMC school board employees.

The decision regarding bonus and ex-gratia for PMT employees is still to be taken. Sources said that the administration has decided to grant Rs 2,250 as ex-gratia to PMT workers as the PMT was incurring losses.

27,Farmers protest in Punjab,"BATHINDA: In the wake of Punjab bandh call given by seven farmers organisations and two left parties on Tuesday, vehicular traffic was disrupted at various places, leading to chaos. The bandh was in protest against the anti-farmer policies of the state government like withdrawal of free power.

Even though the number of participants were few, dharnas on the main road and railway routes brought transportation service to a halt for nearly three hours (between 11 am to 2 pm). Despite the efforts of police to divert traffic from main roads to link roads, the blockade led to long queues at many places. The bandh call was given by Kirti Kisan Union, Democratic Kisan Sabha, Bharitya Kisan Union (BKU)(Ekta and Ugrah group), Kisan Vikas Front and Kul Hind Kirti Kisan Sabha. CPI and CPM have also agreed to support the agitation.

Sarb Hind Shiromani Akali Dal, led by Gurcharan Singh Tohra, has also announced its support to the bandh. The presence of the party leaders, however, was negligible at various places. In Bathinda and Mansa district, the routes were blocked at about 20 places. The maximum response was noted in Rampura Phool, in Bathinda district. The students of TDP Malwa college also joined the agitating farmers here. Passenger trains including Ambala-Sriganganangar (No 335), Ferozepur-Jine (No 346) and Jammu Tawi (No 9112) were late as they were stranded at Rampura Phool and Kotkapura railway stations.

Though the bandh ended by 3 pm in most of the areas, BKU (Ughrah-group) has decided to continue the blockade at Rampura for another 20 hours( till 12 noon on Wednesday). The traffic was blocked at busy routes like Khaniya Chowk, in front of Engineering college on Bathinda-Dabwali road, Bhai Bakhtaur on Bathinda-Mansa road and Bhagi Bander on Bathinda-Talwandi Sabo road.

Patiala: In response to a call for Punjab bandh given by seven farmers organisations in protest against the withdrawal of free power supply to the agriculture sector, a number of farmers blocked rail traffic for two hours at the Rajpura Railway station on Tuesday. Leaders of the Sarb Hind Shiromani Akali Dal also participated in the agitation.

28,Beopar Mandal activists protest against VAT,"PATHANKOT: Pathankot Beopar Mandal activists on Tuesday wore black badges and took out a car rally in markets waiving black flags in protest against the â€˜â€˜anti-traderâ€� policies of the Punjab government. They presented a memorandum of their demands to deputy commissioner K A P Sinha, including withdrawal of value added tax (VAT) and lowering of sales tax.

Addressing a rally at Mahadev Market here, Beopar Mandal leaders said the policies followed by the Amarinder government were not conducive to business, as a result of which traders were badly hit.

Traders of the city have been protesting for the last one week against the excise naka at the Pathankot railway station. Beopar Mandal leaders said that tradersâ€™ goods worth lakhs of rupees had been lying in the railway godowns.

They said that VAT and the cumbersome procedures involved in filling forms had become life difficult for traders on whom excise and taxation officers were unnecessarily imposing penalties. The excise naka was lifted only recently.
