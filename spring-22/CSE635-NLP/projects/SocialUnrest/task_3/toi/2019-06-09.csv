0,Park regulars plan protest despite cut in entry charges,"MUMBAI: Despite a reduction in the entrance fee for morning walkers in Borivliâ€™s Sanjay Gandhi national park, the strollers plan to stage a protest on Sunday. Besides, Borivli resident and advocate Suresh Panicker has asked the high court to strike down a lower courtâ€™s refusal to restrain the state government from levying the charge.

The government had decided to introduce a monthly pass at Rs 50 and a yearly pass at Rs 500. However, following protests, it reduced the fee to Rs 15 and Rs 50. Senior citizens will now be charged Re 1 per year. Everyone entering the park will have to pay.

The Sanjay Gandhi National Park Morning Walkersâ€™ Action Committee has organised a meeting at the park gate at 6 a.m. on Sunday. Mr Panicker said it wasnâ€™t the size of the entry fee that was in question but the right of citizens to free unpolluted air guaranteed under the constitution.

However, people endorsing the decision to charge regular strollers point out that if they can enjoy fresh air at no cost, so must picnickers who come to the park during regular hours.

1,Cong poised for win in municipal polls,"CHANDIGARH: After scoring a landslide victory in the municipal corporation elections held last month, the Congress readies for yet another round of applause for itself when the state goes for zila parishad and panchayat samiti elections on Sunday.

The party has already got an impressive majority with 27 zila parishad and 273 panchayat samiti members being elected unopposed so far.

More than 1.30 crore voters would exercise their franchise to elect 281 zila parishad and 2,484 panchayat samiti members.

In all 679 candidates for zila parishad and 5,872 candidates for panchayat samiti are in the fray.

The campaign for the election has been marred by controversies raked by the Shiromani Akali Dal alleging large scale tampering in the voters'' lists and party workers being deprived of voting right at many places.

State election commissioner C L Bains ordered inquiry in the two districts and cautioned officials against playing a partisan role.

The elections to the two bodies are taking place after more than two years.

2,State politics loses its maha sheen,"MUMBAI: The ongoing crisis in the stateâ€™s politics should make Ram Ganesh Gadkari, the legendary Marathi playwright, turn his grave.

While vintage Gadkari plays delineate the downfall a larger-than-life hero, this weekâ€™s political drama reflects the decline of an entire generation of Maharashtrians, its leaders and ethos.

Events of the last few days have sent a chill down the spine of Maharashtra. Loyalty seems up for auction. Rampant horse-trading is under way amidst charges of abduction and money-power. Elected representatives are being herded around like cattle in the run-up to the trial of strength on the floor of the legislative assembly on June 13.

Money and muscle-power have seized control of the levers of democracy. The state administration has screeched to a halt. Having turned up its nose for decades at the â€˜Ayaram-Gayaramâ€™ culture of the Hindi heartland, Maharashtra seems to be getting its just desserts. The state has begun to resemble Bihar or Uttaranchal, say political observers.

â€œItâ€™s unfortunate that Maharashtra should come to such a pass. This state was once ruled by a band of leaders, both from the Congress as well as the opposition,who were committed to social reforms, economic development and political stability. Maharashtra seems to have severed ties with its hallowed past,â€™â€™ observes veteran CPM leader and former MP Ahilya Rangnekar.

â€œCompare the present-day politicians, irrespective of their party affiliations, with stalwarts such as, say, Yeshwantrao Chavan, and you will know what afflicts Maharashtra today,â€™â€™ says renowned civil servant and former state chief secretary B.G. Deshmukh.

3,State govt hiding under CBI garb,"LUCKNOW: The Central Bureau of Investigation seems to have become a convenient tool for the state government to brush any burning issue under the carpet.

Be it the investigation into the financial irregularities at Sanjay Gandhi Post-Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGIMS) or the sensational murder of Samajwadi Party (SP) MLA Manzoor Ahmad, the state government announced a CBI probe into the two cases. Over a month after the announcements, the cases were yet to land with the CBI.

While a government press release of May 7 announced that a CBI probe has been ordered into the irregularities at the SGPGI, the agency was still awaiting official communication.

Sources in the CBI said that the state government, at the primary stage, will have to register a case with the state police or any other investigating agency before even recommending transfer of the case. Investigations can be transferred to the CBI but cannot be registered with it as fresh ones, the sources said.

Once this condition was met the state government requests the Centre which then sends the case to the CBI to review it and decide if it merits probe by the premier investigating agency. However, the final decision in this regard rests with the Central government even if the CBI does not deem the case fit for investigation.

There are, however, very few instances where the Central government overlooked the observations of the CBI before ordering the transfer of investigation.

Once the Central government approves of the transfer of investigations, the state government issues a notification under section 6 of the CBI Act requesting the Central government to issue a corresponding notification under section 5 of the Act before the case is formally transferred.

The state government was yet to register a case against the SGPGI with any of its agencies before even requesting the Union government to transfer the case to CBI. Taken by surprise by the state governmentâ€™s announcement, the CBI is learnt to have sought details from state administration and has been awaiting a reply for over a fortnight now.

In the Manzoor Ahmad murder case, though the FIR has been lodged, a sources in the special investigation cell (SIC) â€”- IV of the CBI at Lucknow said, there was no intimation if the case has been transferred. â€œMost of the times it is through the newspapers that we come to know that the case has been transferred to us for investigations but when we check up with our documentation we find nothing for months at a stretch,â€� said the source.

4,6 hurt in Bettiah clash,"BETTIAH: A brawl between allegedly inebriated Dalits and an upper caste landlord, Parmanand Shahi, and rumours of attempt to kidnap the latter with an intent to kill him allegedly resulted in his supporters opening fire, injuring six Dalits, including three women at Chananayan-Bandh village under Majhaulia police station, 14 km from here on Friday evening.

Police sources said that a case has been registered against 10 persons, including Vinay Kumar Shahi, member of the West Champaran zila parishad. Village sources trace the genesis of Friday eveningâ€™s incident to a year-long tension and rivalry between upper caste landlords and Dalits in the village.

In July last year, Parmanand Shahi had handed over one Dasai Manjhi, allegedly along with a firearm, alleging forceful felling of timber from Shahiâ€™s land.

This provoked a retaliation and the Dalits lodged a case under the SC/ST Act alleging that Dasai Manjhiâ€™s head was tonsured and he was also forced to drink urine. Shahi and others are on bail in this case.

However, sources from the Shahi family allege an administrative-political conspiracy to defame and harass family members. â€œThe local administration was unable to distribute Siya Ram Shahiâ€™s land in his ceiling case. This has provoked a Dalit backlash under government patronage,â€� said a family member. The immediate provocation behind Fridayâ€™s clash is said to be a refusal by the Shahis to allow one Suresh Manjhi from taking a tractor through the Shahiâ€™s land. Zila parishad member, Vinay Kumar Shahi, meanwhile, pleaded innocence, giving an alibi that â€œI was on way to Bettiah from Patnaâ€�.

Police said all the injured persons were released from hospital after getting first aid. While the police claim the situation is under control, observers apprehend the escalation of a caste war.

5,Patna lawyers defend CJ-CM meet,"PATNA: While criticising RJD supremo Laloo Prasad Yadav for accompanying his wife, CM Rabri Devi, during her meeting with Patna High Court Chief Justice Ravi S Dhavan on Thursday, lawyers, however, have strongly defended the meeting between the CJ and the CM. The judiciary and executive are two pillars of the state and there is a need for coordination between the two, said senior advocate Ramjanam Ojha. He hailed the fact that the CJ met the CM publicly. Even in the best of times, coordination between these two pillars is a tightrope walk, he added.The CJ is also the administrative head of the state judiciary and, therefore, he needs to coordinate with the executive wing on various levels, said senior advocate Keshav Srivastava. Planning resources, manpower and finance is just one of them. The vacancies in courts is a pointer to the crisis caused by the breakdown of the old convention of coordination between the judiciary and the executive in the state, he said. He attributed it, to a great extent, to the fact that Laloo and other senior politicians and bureaucrats have been facing corruption charges. This makes it ethical for the judges to maintain distance from them, Srivastava said.Rights lawyer Basant Kumar Chaudhary said Sushil Kumar Modi's criticism is an immature act as it unnecessarily causes embarrassment to the office of the CJ, and not to Laloo. Justice Dhavan has made a sincere effort, overcoming his hesitation, to fill up the vacancies and to address other issues pertaining to judiciary like pay hike in the wake of a Supreme Court order, he said.Another lawyer Baleshwar Sharma, while agreeing with Chaudhary, said that Justice Dhavan and Rabri Devi are constitutional functionaries and, therefore, they have to meet each other to deal with issues of governance. Senior constitutional lawyer Binod Kanth, however, criticised the CJ for allowing a non-constitutional authority like Laloo to be present. The judiciary should maintain its image, he said, adding the controversy has certainly reduced the dignity of the CJ's office. Some others are hardly worried about protocol and ethics. Said Yogesh Chandra Verma, convenor of the associations of lawyers in the HC: The facts of inadequate infrastructure and the backlog of 10 lakh cases with almost two lakh pending in the HC alone, warrant a coordinated action plan.

6,Patriotism to be taught in some Madrasas,"HYDERABAD: Madrasas, long seen by some sections as anti-nationalist indoctrination camps for young and impressionable minds, are now addressing such criticism head on: The Deeni Madarsas (Islamic schools) in Hyderabad are planning to introduce patriotism as a subject of study. ""Madrasas played a major role in the freedom struggle and some students even laid down their lives for the country. Instead of highlighting our achievements, we have spent our time reacting to the allegations against madrasas. Now we want to put an end to such criticism by showing to all what we really teach in the madarsas,"" the chairman of the Deeni Madrasas, Moulana Mohammed Hameeduddin Aqil Hussami told The Times of India. The proposal to introduce lessons on patriotism is still at an early stage. It is slated for discussion at the forthcoming (June 21-23) meeting of the Muslim Personal Law Board in Hyderabad, at which clerics and scholars will present their views on the matter. If a decision is ratified a month thereafter, about 800 madarsas in and around Hyderabad will include patriotism in their curriculum â€” either as a separate subject or at least as a chapter in a related field of study. Students will be taught what Islam says about the concept of motherland, the role of madrasas in the freedom movement, the contribution of Muslims in various fields since Independence, etc. These lessons will be written by prominent Islamic scholars and historians. As it is, some heads of prominent madrasas said, there already are several chapters related to patriotism in the existing syllabus. ""It was due to some misunderstanding that we are being accused of teaching anti-nationalism. There is a need to show to society what really is taught at madrasas,"" Moulana Mohammed Rizwanul Qasmi, head of Darul Uloom Sabeel-us-Salaam said. More than 20,000 students study in madarsas in the city, including nearly 5,000 in residential schools. The Jamia Islamia Darul Uloom at Shivarampally on the city outskirts with about 5,000 students, the 125-year-old Jamia Nizamia at Shibligunj with over 2,000 students and the Darul Uloom Sabeel-us-Salaam near Barkas with 800 students are among the 10 leading madarsas in the country. ""Patriotism is an inseparable part of our imaan (faith), which we inculcate in all our students. We have been teaching the subject albeit in a sporadic manner. But to counter the propaganda against us, we need to adopt a new approach,"" said Moulana Mohammed Rahimuddin Ansari, secretary of the Jamia Islamia Darul Uloom.

7,Muslims meet today to discuss post-riot scenario,"AHMEDABAD: A crucial meeting of Muslims leaders from the city on Sunday will chalk out a plan for the community in the post-riot period, particularly on issues like compensation to the riot victims, rehabilitation of riot-affected people and help to the riot-hit people to restart their businesses. The meeting, hosted by Juhapura Nagrik Samiti, will be presided over by Mohammed Hanif Daymakumar, a Supreme Court lawyer and general secretary of the state unit of Jamiat-e-Ulema-e-Hind. The meeting is expected to be attended by over 600 representatives from all over the city. According to Ibrahim Siddiqui, one of the convenors, the meeting would be attended by two city Muslim MLAs, Muslim corporators besides representatives from different Muslim sects like Sunni, Shia, Tablighi, Ehle Hadis, Dawoodi Bohara and Khoja . The major issue of Sunday''s meeting would be the failure of the community to raise its voice effectively over the recent communal flare-up, in which many lost their lives and there was extensive damage to property. The biggest problem facing the community is reluctance on the part of the displaced persons to move back to their residences in mixed localities. While the state government is not willing to relocate them to safe areas, the community leaders find it difficult to find new residential areas for the riot affected Muslims. The community leaders are also not happy with the state and the Union government on the issue of rehabilitation of the affected people. The District Industries Centre has recommended to the nationalised banks to advance soft loans to the riot-affected units, but majority of the nationalised banks return the recommendations and express their inability to advance loans. The meeting will pass a comprehensive resolution listing failure of the government and recommend measures for immediate and satisfactory rehabilitation of riot-affected people.

11,Deshmukh rules out change in leadership,"BANGALORE: Beleagured Maharashtra Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh on Sunday ruled out any change in his leadership to save the crisis-ridden Democratic Front government headed by him and asserted he has the ""magic number"" to prove his majority in the Assembly.

""There is no question (of change in the leadership). The High Command has clarified this. The High command has confidence in me,"" Deshmukh said after a nearly three-hour-long interaction with the MLAs of Congress and NCP at a luxurious resort on the city outskirts.

About 101 MLAs are camping at Golden Palms and Resort and Spa owned by film personality Sanjay Khan for the last three days, apparently as part of DF''s strategy to prevent the BJP-Shiv Sena combine from poaching on the DF legislators.

Deshmukh said party president Sonia Gandhi and senior leader Vayalar Ravi had said there was no need for changing the leadership. ""It is very clear"". Asserting that he had the ""magic numbers"", he said he was ""100 per cent confident"" about proving his majority in the trial of strength during the confidence vote on June 13.

12,"PWG protests 'fake encounters', to meet on June 20","HYDERABAD: People''s War Group (PWG) on Sunday lodged protest over ""fake encounters"" during the second round of talks with Andhra Pradesh government even as the two sides agreed to resume talks on June 20 in an effort to maintain peace in the state.

PWG emissaries P Varavara Rao and Gadar, who entered the venue with slogans and placards condemning the encounter deaths at Ananthapur district on Saturday, said after the three-hour long talks here that laying down of arms need not be a pre-condition for lifting of ban.

However, the state representatives K Vijayarama Rao and T Sitaram contended that the law would apply to any one carrying arms and lifting of ban on PWG is directly linked to their proclaimed policy of armed struggle.

While the PWG envoys said that with ""fake encounters"" still on, the atmosphere is not conducive for holding talks, the state emissaries said despite minor skirmishes, the atmosphere is conducive for talks and hoped that they would reach a long-lasting solution soon.

Varavara Rao, who also agreed it was people''s will that the talks should continue, said they have protested over the encounter killings which took most of the time at the negotiating table on Sunday.

+We strongly object to this and have to conclude that the `police will'' prevails over `politcal will''+, Varavara Rao said condemning encounters between the two rounds of talks. He also took objection to the tone of Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu about his comment on lifting of ban on naxals.

+Hostilities should cease and a strong will should prevail on both sides to work out terms and set the agenda for final talks where an agreement could be reached. All this is possible only when there is a conducive atmosphere+, Rao said.

From the government side, Vijayarama Rao said, the state was committed to hold dialogue with PWG to find a permanent solution to naxalite problem and proclaimed that since lifting of ban is linked to armed struggle, it can only be part of a permanent solution.

While the state suggests that dialogue should come first and lifting of ban should form part of the solution, PWG suggests lifting the ban first could create conducive atmosphere which enables to go futher on talks.

On stopping of combing operations, Vijayarama Rao said, movement of armed cadres of PWG in and around villages is not conducive for talks and the state has to respond to maintain law and order.

He also claimed that a congenial atmosphere has been created by the state for talks.

On the Inovolu incident where two civilians were injured in firing by PWG recently, the state said it has a duty to protect people from armed squads while PWG contends police were using civilians as a shield to carry out attacks on them.

14,Tackle extremism politically: Marandi,"RANCHI: Describing extremism as the state''s biggest problem, Jharkhand chief minister Babulal Marandi says that the Naxalites and extremists have a ""political agenda"". Hence, he urged the politicians and social workers to visit the remote Naxal-prone areas to check their growing menace.

Concluding the seven-hour-long deliberations on ""extremism"" here on Saturday, Marandi said extremism cannot be solved or checked by using police force alone; the people will have to come forward and help.

He also said that the Jharkhand police is not indulging in excesses against the extremists. This is borne out by the fact that 92 policemen have been killed by the extremists while only 44 extremists have been killed in encounters with the police.

He said a lot has been done to contain extremism, but a lot more remains to be done. He assured that suggestions given during the day-long deliberations would be compiled and a suitable course of action would be decided.

Jharkhand assembly Speaker Inder Singh Namdhari, introducing the subject, said a clean and corruption-free administration, strengthening village-level bodies and strict police action should be able to check the national malaise of extremism.

18,Numbers being changed in riot camp,"AHMEDABAD: It is an intense number game that is being played between the Ahmedabad district administration and organisers of various riot relief camps in the city.

The administration is blaming the organisers of fudging figures to get more grants and not allowing the officials to make a proper count to ascertain the exact number of persons still living in these camps.

As a result there are two sets of figures about number of people huddled in 20 relief camps in Ahmedabad - one by the organisers (88,000) and one by the government agencies (27,000). Government sources even allege that in certain cases camp organisers are offering people money to come for the head-count during verification by district officials.

""On Wednesday, one of our team was gheraoed and prevented from conducting verification survey in Char Toda Kabrastan camp,"" says Ashok Mehta, deputy collector. According to him, camp organisers refused to co-operate with the survey teams to ascertain the number of people living in the camp. ""Organisers also refused to counter-sign verification report prepared by us,"" Mehta said.

The camp organisers have claimed a strength of 2,000, but district officials found far less people after verifying it four times. Mehta added that on May 29 the total number of camp inmates were 346 which decreased to 185 on May 31. Again on June 5, it dropped to 112, while it again increased to 666 on June 6.

""There are less number of people living in these relief camps than what is made out. There are some vested interests who want to inflate figures for various reasons,"" says district collector K Srinivas. He added that despite giving 24-hour notice to camp organisers for verification, there was no co-operation from the other side. ""Officially, there are 27,000 people living in around 20 camps in the city, but actually the number could be much less,"" Srinivas added.

The district administration has also decided to check the accounts maintained by organisers. Sources in the district collectorate also pointed out that some of the organisers are deliberately trying to avoid verification to avail government''s cash assistance on fudged numbers.

The state government till now has disbursed Rs 3.25 crore as administrative expenses at the rate of Rs 7 per head since relief camps opened in the aftermath of riots, besides Rs 25 per person worth of ration allocated by the government.

""Is it possible to count each riot-affected person residing in these camps. Everybody has some work to attend. How can everyone remain present when district officials visit the camp,"" said Mohsin Kadri, chief organiser of the Shah-e-Alam relief camp.

Contradicting district collectorate''s figure, he said there are 32 relief camps in Ahmedabad accommodating over 88,000 riot-affected people. ""We at Shah-e-Alam are getting government''s relief assistance for 7,324 people, but actually there 10,500 people living in our camp,"" added Kadri, saying that he will be more than happy to hand over relief camps to government.
