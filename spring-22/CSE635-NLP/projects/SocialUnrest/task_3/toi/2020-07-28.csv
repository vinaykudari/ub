1,"Notices to home ministry, Delhi govt","NEW DELHI: The Delhi High Court has issued show cause notices to the Union home ministry, Delhi government and Municipal corporation of Delhi (MCD) regarding illegal slaughter houses operating in the city.

The court sought explanation after hearing a public interest litigation (PIL). The petitioner, Mohammed Amzad, alleged that he had not been paid incentive despite the government earning a large amount of money through fines imposed on butchers against who he gave information.

Mohammed stated that he had been complaining to the MCD about the illegal operations of butchers for the last three years, everyday. He claimed that he helped the government earn nearly Rs 1.5 crore. He also claimed that he was being denied 20 per cent commission on the recoveries made by the MCD. Which, according to him, he was entitled to under the police and income-tax and excise department regulations.

His counsel, Tariq Siddiqui, claimed that most of the butchers were operating in collaboration with the local police. The petitioner also sought a check on adulteration of buffalo meat with mutton. A routine parctice for butchers. The counsel further said that dead or sick animals were also being slaughtered for consumption.

2,"Ban on plastic spells profits for MCD, govt","NEW DELHI: It isnâ€™t about plastic money, but money out of plastic that has sta-lled the implementation of the Delhi Plastic Act, 2001. According to sources in the sanitation engineering department, there has been a war of letters between the MCD and the Delhi government over who keeps the moneymade out of challans in MCD areas.

â€˜â€˜This is the main reason why the Act remains unimplemented in 97 per cent of the city, which comes under MCD,â€™â€™ said the source. The Plastics Act, 2001, has provisions for fines running into thousands, a lucrative pie that both the Delhi government and the MCD want. According to MCDâ€™s letters written to the chief secretary, Delhi government, since its staff would be implementing the Act, the fine should be deposited in MCDâ€™s account.

The fight is over the notification of such a provision. If this is done then, the chief sanitary inspector at the zonal level would challan offenders and the District Health Officer (DHO) would be the compounding authority. The additional commissioner conservancy and sanitation engineering (CSE) Ramesh Negi acknowledged that letters on this issue were sent to the chief secretaryâ€™s office.

â€˜â€˜The the main issue is about the money,â€™â€™ he said. â€˜â€˜We have enough staff to implement the Act, however, I want all statutory provisions to be made clearâ€™â€™ he said. He added that since the Act had been passed by the Delhi government, regarding its own territory, and administration, it has to be tailored to be implemented in MCD areas. The Act was passed on October 2, 2001, but it see-ms both sides need more time to sort things out.

3,Anti-conversion law: Stuck in implementation stage,"GANDHINAGAR: Four months after the enactment of the Freedom of Religion Act, 2003, by the Gujarat Assembly, there is no one in the Modi government who can stand up and say that the law banning forced conversion from one religion to another has taken effect in the state.

No one in the Sachivalaya â€” not even state parliamentary and legal affairs minister Ashok Bhatt â€” is willing to say whether this controversial piece of legislation has been put into practice.

Bhatt evades queries on the issue saying â€œonly the state home department can tellâ€�. The home department is tight-lipped on the issue.

Sources concede that the department had not even come up with the simple notification necessary for initiating the implementation of the Act, but failed to say why.

It is only after the home department issues the notification that rules, based on the notification, can be framed. And only when rules are framed would the district collector, the main executing agent, be able to allow or disallow conversions under the new law. Insiders add it may take at least another fortnight for the notification to be out.

It is surprising that the government, which showed haste in passing the Bill, is dragging its feet in enforcing it. However, insiders say the government has initiated a process to make the law stricter.

If the Act, as passed in the assembly, states that the priest performing the conversion must take the permission of the district magistrate, a senior home department official says the rules may ensure that even the organiser of the event has to take such permission 30 days before the actual function.

The proposed rules also specify that Sikhs, Jains and Buddhists need not take any permission for converting anyone, as they are all â€œfundamentally Hindusâ€�.

The Act provides that the rules need be placed before the state legislature â€œnot less than 30 days beforeâ€� an assembly session. The next session is scheduled in September.

A Sachivalaya official quoted Section 8 of the Act which states, â€œThe state government may, by notification in the Official Gazette, make rules for carrying out the provisions of this Act.â€�

The official insisted that framing of rules or the notification of the Act is not necessary for its implementation. Rules for several Acts have not been formed for decades and yet they are under implementation, he said.

Rights organisations are so far unwilling to go to court, challenging the Act, as they say that as far as they are concerned, the law does not exist as no notification has been issued.

5,Human chain protest turns violent,"LUCKNOW: Twentyfive persons, including three students and two policemen, were hurt when a mob comprising students of St Maryâ€™s School and residents of Para locality in Talkatora clashed with the police on Monday. They had formed a human chain to protest poor civic conditions in the area. The protest turned violent and police had to resort to lathicharge.

School principal Father John Augustine, vice principal Sapna Chatterjee, local corporatorâ€™s husband Prem Yadav and several supporters were arrested allegedly for instigating the protestors.

Para has been a neglected locality for long. With the onset of monsoon, the condition of roads turned awful. The civic conditions too are deplorable. Despite every effort by residents, the authorities were unmoved. So on July 7 Para Kshetra Sangharsh Samiti announced a series of protests and Mondayâ€™s â€œhuman chainâ€� was first of the series. The principal, also samiti convenor, was spearheading the campaign to see Para done up.

On Monday, around 8:30 am, hundreds of students of St Maryâ€™s and other institutions led by Fr Augustine and other staff members began the protest. Corporator Jayshree Yadavâ€™s husband Prem was also present. They stopped the Howrah-Amristar Express for several hours at Jalalpur railway crossing. Shortly after the protest began, station officer (SO) Talkatora police station arrived and entered into a heated argument with the principal.

Soon the situation took an ugly turn as the SO and principal virtually scuffled. That triggered violent reactions from the protestors. Grossly outnumbered, the police beat a hasty retreat as the mob resorted to heavy stone pelting leaving two of them, including the SO, injured. Some students too suffered injuries.

Later, the police returned with PAC, personnel from other police stations, anti-riot vehicles and fire tenders even as the mob continued stone pelting damaging over a dozen buses and private cars. An aide of Prem Yadav fired in the air from the licensed revolver creating panic among students, who at this stage were withdrawn to the school campus.

Then began police crackdown. Nine persons including the principal, vice principal, Prem Yadav and his aides were nabbed. It took well over four hours for the police to get the situation back to normal.

7,Police restrained from arresting Roshans,"MUMBAI: Hrithik and Rakesh Roshan can breathe easy for a while. The Bombay high court on Monday restrained the Khar police from arresting the father and son a week in connection with criminal complaints of cheating and breach of trust. Aggrieved by a lower court order, the Roshans had asked the high court quash criminal proceedings against them and restrain the Khar police from arresting them.

The police were acting on complaint by Jayantilal Gada, the managing director of Popular Entertainment Network Ltd., who had alleged that the Roshans and their company, Film Kraft Productions India), had backed out of a contract. The Roshansâ€™ lawyers, Ashok Mundargi and Dipesh Mehta, told Justice V.M. Kanade that the complainant is treating what is essentially a civil dispute as a criminal case.

The matter has been adjourned to August 4. The Roshans urged the HC to quash an order passed by a Bandra magistrate in May directing the Khar police to investigate the cheating complaint Mr Gada made against them. The Roshansâ€™ lawyers said the complainant had suppressed some facts. They said that Film Kraft about two years ago had entered into several agreements with Popular Entertainment about the filmmerchandising and home-viewing rights to Kaho Naa Pyar Hai and other productions of the Roshans. Mr Gadaâ€™s company alleged that after it spent crores of rupees to create a market, the Roshans backed out from the contract.

But Mr Mundargi and Mr Mehta said the magistrate was not informed that the Roshans had terminated two agreements in March 2003 for breach of contract and for failing to make payments for TV telecast rights. They also said that the complaint accused the Roshans of copyright violations without any supporting evidence.

Public prosecutor Shahaji Shinde said the police had registered four complaints of cheating against the Roshans recently. Since the Roshansâ€™ lawyer told the judge that he was aware of only one such complaint, the court directed the police to furnish him with a copy of all the complaints.

9,"Post disinvestment, it is status quo at PTL","CHANDIGARH: The CDC Group''s acquisition of the 23.4 per cent Punjab government stake in Punjab Tractors Limited has come as a relief to the management of the company.

In the post-disinvestment scenario, the role of CDC is being viewed strictly as that of an investor concerned with returns. Punjab Tractors Limited sources say that in spite of its status as the single largest shareholder in the company, CDC is unlikely to impose itself on the present management in day-to-day operations.

On the other hand, the same stake in the hands of a tractor manufacturer like Mahindra and Mahindra would have lead to a completely different scenario.

Being from the same industry, it would have had its own ideas on running the company and would have tried to bring in new people on key company positions.

Sources say that CDC is expected to confine itself to broad policy issues. â€˜â€˜We have heard about their plans on making Punjab Tractors Limited a global player, but apart from that there has been no talk on this issue,'''' says an official.

The present development has also put the spotlight on the role of Indian financial institutions. With a 46.44 per cent stake (UTI -16.24 percent, LIC - 14.71, GIC - 7.95, IDBI -7.29, IFCI - 0.14 Nationalised banks - 0.11), the FIs have four directors on the 12-member board of directors of the company.

Company sources say that so far the present management has found support with the FIs and there is no reason for that to change in the coming days.

The term of the present CMD, who had got a two-year extension in March 2002 is due expire in April, 2004. Any kind of move at top before the expiry of the term seems unlikely.

The confidence of the present management is also on account of the performance of the company vis-a-vis other tractor manufacturers.

In 2002-03, Punjab Tractors Limited posted a pre tax profit of 62.2 crore on a sale of 24,200 tractors.

Compared to this, Mahindra and Mahindra made a pre-tax profit of Rs 28 crore on sale of 48,000 tractors, Eicher posted a loss Rs 10 crore on a sale of 15800 tractors and Escorts reported a loss of Rs 162 crore on a sale of 21,000 tractors.

A drop in company profits from 100 crore in 2001-02 to 42 crore in 2002-03 is being attributed to the â€˜worst ever year'' for tractor manufacturers where every manufacturer took a hit on the bottom line due to drop sales volume.

10,Two govt schools to have multimedia labs,"CHANDIGARH: After a long wait, two government schools in the city have finally got sanction from the UT education department to establish multimedia labs.

The two schools are Government Model Senior Secondary School, Sector 16, and Sector 33.

Multimedia labs will facilitate the school students to study difficult lessons on computers and make it easier for them to memorise the topics. The schools, which were earlier using the hired systems, have now purchased their own systems.

Principal of Government Model Senior Secondary School, Sector 16, Ram Kumar told TNN that multimedia techniques which were so far being used to teach students above class VII will now also be used for junior students also.

He said that subject teachers have specially designed lessons identifying various areas which will be taught using the multimedia facility.

In Government Model Senior Secondary School, Sector 33, the multimedia lab will be formally inaugurated at the end of this month. Principal of the school Karan Singh said that they have made a plan in such a way that every class can attend at least one lesson in the multimedia lab twice a week.

The students above class VI will be given teaching though multimedia in the school.

School authorities have planned to provide teaching of general knowledge also through multimedia by use of illustrations and graphics.

Teachers felt that use of modernised techniques makes teaching interesting not only for students but for teachers also. Teachers maintained that it gives them a break from normal class room and book teaching. Such facilities should be provided to maximum students in this Information Technology (IT) age, they suggested.

11,Army trucks flouting SC guidelines,"CHANDIGARH: The road accident involving Army truckimprovised-bus which left 20 school children injured on Monday has raised questions about the safety of hundreds of students travelling by these â€˜school busesâ€™.

Though the Supreme Court had issued guidelines for school buses,Army vehicles do not adhere to them.

There have been drives by the government agencies for enforcing these guidelines, however, no one dared touch the Army vehicles.

Union defence minister George Fernandes in April this year stopped the usage of Army trucks in Delhi to ferry school children. This announcement was made following criticism over the death of a school girl travelling in an Army truck a few months ago. Though the government acceded that the Army trucks used as school buses also come under the purview of the Supreme Court guidelines, no efforts have been made to improve them.

Sources said that in the absence of adequate funds, the Army continues to use â€˜outdatedâ€™ Army vehicles as school buses. According to the Supreme Court regulations, the school buses should preferably have a flap (sliding) door, which is not the case in these modified Army trucks. The Army truck, which met with an accident on Monday, had weld mesh door on its rear side,which got jammed thus locking the 40 students inside it. The students had to be taken out after tearing open the tarpaulin sheets.

The long seats in the truck placed facing each other is also a contravention of the Supreme Court guidelines. The seats should be placed in one direction, with each following the other.

Unlike other buses, the modified-trucks pose a great threat to children, as it does not have a sound metal body which could protect children from falling out in case of a accident.

Thin tarpaulin sheets cannot take the impact of a collision and are a easily torn. Moreover, there are no side windows because of which persons seated inside are clueless about the traffic movement around them. In Mondayâ€™s accident, students were not aware till they were extracted out as to what had hit them. Had there been windows, the hapless students could have made some effort to save themselves away from the impact of the collision.

The Supreme Court had issued these guidelines after November 28, 1997, tragedy when 28 students of Ludlow Castle School, Delhi, were killed when their bus fell into the Yamuna river off the Wazirabad bridge.

Meanwhile, Army officials here said that such modified trucks are used for carrying school children all over the country.

They, however, refused to comment on the Supreme Court guidelines.

12,"Withdraw Tada cases, CPI(ML) tells govt","PATNA: Even as five CPI(ML) legislators staged a dharna within the assembly premises on Monday demanding withdrawal of Terrorist and Disruptive Activities Act (Tada) cases against 16 of its followers lodged in the Jehanabad jail, the state government appears to be reluctant to withdraw the Act.

""Cine star Sunil Dutt''s son Sanjay Dutt is facing cases while the Act has been withdrawn because the case was filed when Tada was in force in the country. The same situation is with these ML activists too,"" labour minister Upendra Prasad Verma said.

However, ML leaders declare the government''s stand on the issue as duplicity. ""It''s ironical that the government, which says that it will not enforce Pota, is continuing with the Tada cases,"" said ML leader in the assembly Ram Naresh Ram. He said they were forced to sit on dharna infront of Speaker''s chamber because he had failed to keep his promise in getting the government to make a statement inside the assembly.

The Speaker called a meeting of ML MLAs in his chamber with minister Upendra Prasad Verma. ""The Speaker has assured us that he will make the government issue a statement on the floor of the House. Verma also said that he would consider our demands and hold a high-level meet on Wednesday. We have suspended our dharna for now. But we will not enter the House until Tada cases are withdrawn,"" said party MLA Raja Ram Singh.

The ML claims the state government has withdrawn Tada cases in Jehanabad against many including chief of Swarn Liberation Front Ramadhar Singh or Diamond. Diamond, the party says, was the main accused in Sawanbigha and Meinbarsingha massacres. They said others against whom Tada was revoked include Lala Yadav, Kaleem Khan, Devbali Yadav, Madhav Yadav and Lal Babu Yadav.

The 16 persons, declared guilty under Tada in connection with Bhadasi police firing in 1988 by a court in Jehanabad on June 21, 2003, are all political activists of the party. ""One interesting aspect of the verdict,"" the party said, ""is that one Vakil Singh declared innocent by the court has already spent 15 years in jail.""

14,Absence of family courts annoys Union minister,"PATNA: Junior Union law minister P C Thomas here on Monday expressed great surprise over the non-existence of family courts in the state, except one at Patna.

Thomas promised that if the Bihar government sends a proposal to the Centre for establishment of a family court in every district he will see to it that the proposal is cleared at the earliest.

The minister also assured that the Central government will give Rs 10 lakh for the establishment of each court. Besides this it will also give Rs 5 lakh every year for day-to-day functioning of the courts.

Thomas said that the ministry is going through a proposal to introduce a law in the near future to punish erring police officials or common people who try to implicate innocent persons in false cases. ""This decision was reached because a large number of complaints regarding false cases were raised in recent times"", he said.

Speaking at the second foundation day and national convention of the Indian Federal Democratic Party (IFDP) at the Sri Krishna Memorial Hall, Thomas expressed concern over the rising crime rate in the state. He said that not a single day passes when the newspapers do not carry a report of kidnapping or murder in the state.

He said in a state continuously disturbed by criminal activities, there is no way by which the people can move on the path of development. ""This is the reason why a state like Bihar which has the best talents in the country and one of the most fertile lands is backward even after five decades of independence"", said Thomas.

He further criticised the present RJD government for not utilising Central funds in the development of rural areas. Even after over 12 years of continuous rule by Laloo Prasad Yadav and Rabri Devi the so-called well wishers of the downtrodden, no substantial change can be seen in their condition, he said.

The party, in its political resolution, passed unanimously among other things, the proposal for reservation to the Muslim community.

The national working president, Mohan S Delkar, was the chief guest on the occasion. Prominent among others present on the occasion were party''s national president Anwarul Haque and national general secretary Pappu Yadav.

15,Is crime rising? asks minister,"PATNA: Biharâ€™s record in respect of crime is better than Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan as per the statistics given in â€œCrime in India 2000â€�, said minister for panchayati raj Upendra Prasad Verma.

He was defending the state government in his reply to a special debate on the recent spurt in crime in the council here on Monday. He quoted the number of abductions and abductions for ransom during the last three years to buttress his point.

The minister said during 2000, the number of abduction cases was 2,237 and of abductions for ransom 418. In 2001, the number of abductions came down to 1,689 and of abductions for ransom to 385. Next year, the incidents of abduction were 1,948 whereas the number of abductions for ransom was 396. Thus, during 2001 and 2002 the incidents of abductions and abductions for ransom were less than in 2000.

He said the trend continued in the current year as well. He cited figures for the first six months of 2001, 2002 and 2003. He stated that during the first half of 2001, the number of abductions recorded was 776 and of abductions for ransom 150. The figure was 749 and 203 respectively in 2002 while in the current year, it has been 1,001 and 176 respectively.

Talking about an action plan to check abductions, he said many steps had been initiated at the DGP-level for monitoring of these crimes and for vigorous proactive and reactive action by the police. Police have initiated steps to analyse the methods of crime and identify the gangs involved in them, their areas of operation, modus operandi, places of shelter, vehicles used and escape routes etc in order to check abductions.

The minister listed several cases in which the police had succeeded in getting abduction victims released. These, he said, included the release ofassembly Speakerâ€™s grandson Sagar Kumar, film distributor Anil Bubna, steel merchant Shailesh Kumar, PHD chief engineer Kedar Nath, neurosurgeon Dr. Ramesh Chandra and gold merchant Sanjay Dayal.

16,"Banks, shops observe bandh","PATNA: The Patna West bandh called by the BJP in protest against the kidnapping of a schoolboy and a bank manager threw normal life out of gear in the area while banking activities came to a standstill in the Patna and Rohtas districts on Monday with the striking bank employees staging dharnas in front of their respective branches.

Even ATM branches remained closed during the strike. The entire stretch from Sheikhpura to Jagdeo Path on Bailey Road remained disturbed.

The bandh protagonists blocked almost all the roads and the bylanes in the area in protest against the kidnapping of 8-year-old Siddhant Parmar on Thursday.

The police have not been able to trace Siddhant, son of a bank employee, so far.

The agitators used burning tyres to prevent movement of cars and two-wheelers. Lathi-wielding youths smashed windowpanes and lights of passing vehicles to give vent to their ire. All the shops and business establishments in the area remained closed. A number of schools, including the DPS and Radiant International School, also remained closed.

Police reinforcements, including the anti-riot vehicle â€œVajraâ€�, had been deployed all along the disturbed area to check any untoward incident.

Sugar cane minister Raghvendra Pratap Singh, who is Siddhantâ€™s uncle, had appealed to the people to refrain from creating any law and order problem so that the police could concentrate on tracing Siddhant. Singh told TNN on Monday that the police were doing everything possible to recover the boy. Siddhantâ€™s family members said that they had not received any ransom call so far.

â€œHow can anyone expect us to do our job when our children are not safe? Of the 30,000 bank employees in Bihar, half are from outsidethe state. After these incidents, nobody wants to be posted in Bihar,â€� said A K Singh, an SBI official. He said the bank transactions in Patna alone are to the tune of Rs 100 crore every day.

The bankers also took out a procession and submitted a memorandum to the CM.

22,UN reluctant to resume work in Pak province,"ISLAMABAD: The United Nations is reluctant to resume field operations in Pakistan''s northwest frontier province (NWFP) and Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), despite assurances by the provincial government that security cover would be provided to their field staff, in the wake of a firing on one of its vehicles.

Two workers of the World Health Organisation (WHO) including a doctor escaped narrowly in the firing while the vehicle was partially damaged on July 23, in the outskirts of Peshawar.

All the UN bodies including UNICEF, WFP and UNHCR suspended their field operations in the NWFP and FATA for indefinite period.

""Although the NWFP government has extended full assurances regarding security, but the UN is re-assessing its security arrangements in all target areas of the province and Fata,"" a representative of WHO was quoted as saying. Official sources said the federal and provincial governments took serious note of the firing on a UN vehicle and assured the world body that the government would adopt appropriate measures to curb such incidents in future.

""We did not receive security clearance from the headquarters,"" the WHO official said. He said the authorities have assured the UN bodies that the culprits who targeted the WHO vehicle would be arrested within a few days and the police department had started investigations.

24,"Quake, riots leave 50,000 mentally ill","GANDHINAGAR: The earthquake of 2001 and communal disturbances of 2002 have reportedly left 50,000 people mentally disturbed in Gujarat. But an acute shortage of trained counsellors to treat increasing cases of mental morbidity is being felt in the state.

The state government has launched a major drive to combat mental illnesses, with the help of United Nations Population Fund and Indian Council of Medical Research, and concerted efforts are being made to engage more medical and para-medical staff to strengthen the ongoing project.

The government has embarked upon a Mental Health Mission to set up mental health centres in all districts. Sources said 10 teams of trained counsellors and doctors are moving around in Kutch providing help and treatment to those who have become mentally disturbed in wake of the quake. A team of Central government officials, during its recent visit to the state capital has assured help of Rs.1.5 crore to the state under National Mental Health Programme for setting up permanent mental health centres in Kutch and Surendranagar districts which were worst-affected in the quake.

A senior psychiatrist attached to the state mental health department said, â€œAs per a survey conducted by the World Health Organisation, any natural or man-made disasters leave 25 to 30 per cent of the population mentally disturbed, and accordingly a huge number of people have been affected by these tragedies in Gujarat.â€�

The psychiatrist said the government had organised re-orientation and training programme for medical and para-medical staff of Kutch to deal with such cases efficiently. â€œThe department has also decided to upgrade facilities in Godhra mental health centre operating from civil hospital. This centre has been dealing with the cases relating to mental disorders reported from Central Gujarat region which was rocked by the riots last year,â€� he said. Rough estimates put the figure of people suffering from mental illnesses to around five lakh in the state.

At present Navsari district is being developed as a model district under this mission and a sum of Rs 91.70 lakh has been spent for the mental health centre, the first in South Gujarat. The Central government team, after visiting the Navsari centre has conveyed to the government that the unit needs more trained people to attend to patients suffering from mental illnesses.

The state government, officials said, would approach Gujarat Public Service Commission to have more trained social workers, psychiatrists and experts for effective implementation of the National Mental Health Programme.

25,Oppn reactions to BSP-BJP politics,"LUCKNOW: It was a wait and watch policy for the Opposition parties of Uttar Pradesh during the 24-hour long drama when the BSP-BJP coalition government came close to a break up on Tuesday.

None amongst the main stream opposition parties including the Samajwadi party, the Congress, the Rashtriya Lok Dal or even the Rashtriya Kranti Party made any comment on the ongoing developments.

Aware that these developments could take any turn keeping in view the compulsions of the coalition and the now-on now-off approach of the two partners, the parties are continuing to adhere to their August 7 strategy when the budget session of the UP Assembly would be convened. The intent is to pull down the government on a finance bill if a division of votes takes place.

It was this which led the Samajwadi Party state president Ram Sharan Das to observe that the demand of chief minister Mayawati for the resignation of Union tourism and culture minister Jagmohan and later her backtracking on the same was nothing but a `blackmailing tactic'' adopted to ensure that she remained in power. With regards the BJP''s role, Das chose to dub the party as `besharam'' (shameless) which was willing to go to any extent to ensure that the SP and its president Mulayam Singh Yadav was kept out of power.

The Congress Legislature Party leader Pramod Tewari termed such occurences in the BSP-BJP as routine. ""Such happenings are routine in this coalition and take place after intervals of every few days."" He elaborated ""this alliance is not bound by any principle, ideology or interest of state. It is simply a case of rule and loot the state by both the partners. When there is a dispute over the loot they quarrel and when the dispute is resolved they unite. This is what happened on Tuesday also"" he said.

Near similar views were voiced by the national vice president of the Rashtriya Lok Dal Kailash Nath Singh Yadav who referred to the ongoing CBI inquiry in the Taj Heritage corridor. ""The shifting of Mayawati''s stance on Jagmohan''s resignation has to be seen in this perspective also"", he opined. ""That the BJP for the first time chose to adopt a tough attitude vis-Ã -vis its alliance partner is also indicative of the saffron party''s realisation that its vote bank has shifted under this coalition"" he added.
