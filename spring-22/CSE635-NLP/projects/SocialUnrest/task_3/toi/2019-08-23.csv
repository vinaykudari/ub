0,Saathi bypassed on liquor policy,"NEW DELHI: While executing its most ambitious project till date, to open private liquor vends in the city, the Delhi state excise department has not bothered to involve its finance minister Mahinder Singh Saathi.

The department is in the process of issuing licenses for private liquor vends, but without consulting their minister. No files, related to issuing licenses to open private liquor vends in Delhi, have been sent to the minister for his approval.

In fact, the department officials have been instructed that only the state excise commissioner would have the final word.

While the state excise departmentâ€™s latest demeanour has triggered a controversy on the authority of state ministers vis-a-vis the bureaucracy, sources said the state excise commissioner, in all legality, can issue licenses for liquor shops without consulting his minister.

Under the Punjab Excise Act, which has been adopted in Delhi, the collector (excise) is in full authority to issue and renew licenses for opening liquor vends in the city, a senior government official said.

Despite the provision in the Act, the excise department had been seeking state finance ministerâ€™s approval for issuing liquor shop licenses. Before the elected government in Delhi, the lt-governor had been clearing files on liquor licenses.

â€˜â€˜Though itâ€™s legal, it is the first time this precedent has been defied,â€™â€™ an official pointed out.

Under the new excise policy, which came into effect on July 1, the state government decided to allow about 70 private liquor vends in Delhi. The department has received 514 applications from private players interested in setting up liquor shops. The last date to file applications was August 2.

State excise commissioner Narendra Kumar said the department was scrutinising applications and hoped to finalise names of people to get private vends by draw of lots which is likely to be held on August 30.

The state excise department has also received applications from government-run enterprises to open country liquor vends. Under the new excise policy, the government has decided to open 70 new country liquor vends in resettlement colonies and slum clusters.

Kumar said the department was conducting site verifications to allow new country liquor vends. The excise department has also completed the process of issuing fresh L-1 licenses to wholesalers supplying liquor to government vends.

The state government has also invited applications for licenses to sell liquor in banquet halls and farmhouses. Kumar said the proposal to all sale of beer in departmental stores would be taken up next month.

â€˜â€˜We have to formalise rules and eligibility criteria for departmental stores which can sell beer. This would be taken up after the process of opening private vends is complete,â€™â€™ he said.

3,Looting incidents on rise in Surat,"SURAT: Keeping in view the recent spurt in looting incidents at odd hours in the city, the city police have planned to intensify patrolling during the late and the wee hours.

On Wednesday, three men, aged around 25 years, snatched a bag containing over Rs 38,000 near Puna Kumbharia Road from one Kaniyalal Ratilal Mehta, a resident of Parvat Patia. The incident took place in the late hours and all the accused on motorcycles had their faces covered, according to police.

The victim was carrying the bag with its contents exposed and the accused did not have much of a difficulty in snatching it from him, police said. According to police commissioner V K Gupta, people should carry cash from one place to another in a bag, chained to their vehicles. But, in this case, the victim was carrying the bag, hanging from the motorcycle, investigating officials said.

In another incident, one Bharatbhai Vakharia and his wife while on an evening stroll in Maharana Pratap Bag near Varachha on Wednesday, were forced by two youths to hand over a gold necklace worth Rs 10,000 and Rs 600 in cash to them.

Additional commissioner of police Mohan Jha told TNN, that the police patrolling in the early morning hours would be intensified to prevent these kind of looting incidents in the city. More policemen in plainclothes would be deputed in the evening hours to keep a watch on gardens and other spots where people go for leisure activities.

The city police would soon arrange a meeting with all the ''angadias'' to create awareness about safety measures they should follow while transacting cash and other valuables from one place to another in the city, Jha told TNN.

Besides, as several looting incidents in the past have taken place in the wee hours, when police patrolling is lax, from 5 am to 10 am the police patrolling at several places would be intensified to prevent such incidents, Jha explained.

5,VHP lawyers to fight for riot-hit victims,"AHMEDABAD: Dilipbhai Trivedi, state general-secretary of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, is also a public prosecutor in Mehsana, pleading in courts on behalf of Muslim riot victims.

Several other public prosecutors owing allegiance to the BJP and the VHP, will be entrusted with the responsibility of representing riot victims in courts all over the state. Many of them are office-bearers.

In Ahmedabad, it is reported that at least nine of the 16 public prosecutors are active workers of Sangh Parivar groups.

Among the prosecutor panel in Ahmedabad are two VHP members, who also fought cases of the riot-accused free.

There are apprehensions that their ideological leanings could derail the process of justice. For, in many cases, the accused and the public prosecutor belong to the same organisation.

Yusuf Charkha, a Godhra lawyer, says, ""you should see some of these government pleaders in action. Instead of pinning down the accused, they seem to be pleading their cases.""

Trivedi, however, defends his position. ""An individual performs different roles in life. In court I am an advocate, but when I am with the VHP I perform as is expected of me.""

There are allegations that the selection of public prosecutors for the riot cases has been done by the BJP government in such a way that ""ideology, rather than competence, has taken precedence.""

â€˜I do not expect justice to be done in such circumstances. Their political ideologies will come in the way,""says senior advocate Girish Patel.

6,Govt schemes for farmers come a cropper,"LUCKNOW: The government may have declared the entire state as drought-hit and suspended revenue collection in the affected areas, yet the farmers are still to find a suitable way to compensate the loss of crops suffered by them.

According to official statics, fifty per cent of cultivable land in the state has remained without any sowing. This would bring down even production of rabi crop by less than fifty per cent of the estimation.

A few years ago, the state government had announced a crop insurance scheme, â€˜Sankat haran bima yojnaâ€™ to help farmers hit by natural calamities like flood and drought. Under this scheme, a farmer on purchasing fertilisers was to get an insurance cover of Rs 1 lakh without paying any premium.

The scheme also envisaged that the farmers purchasing a bag of fertilisers from IFCO, KRIBHCO, or Indian Potash Ltd, through cooperatives, were supposed to get a free accident insurance cover of Rs 4,000. The amount of insurance was to go up to Rs 1 lakh depending on the ratio of the number of bags purchased by farmers.

The government had also announced that the farmers whose entire crop was destroyed by natural calamity would get a subsidy up to fifty per cent, provided the farmer was covered under the scheme, said an official of the agriculture department.

However, none of these schemes could be of any use for the farmers of Uttar Pradesh when the kharif crop has been ruined in more than 7 lakh hectares of land. Of this, ninety per cent of the land belongs to small and marginal farmers. After announcing these schemes, the government conveniently forgot to complete the formality and allowed the scheme to lapse.

A farmer of Azamgarh, Ambarish Rai told this correspondent that if the government had really introduced the two crop insurance schemes, the farmers would have been able to weather this calamity.

In such a situation, when the farmers are facing the worst kind of drought, the refusal to give BPL cards to Dalit villagers have further compounded the problems for them, said Rai. Citing an instance, he said that Puran Lal and Maiku Lal of Sarsanda village under Gopramau in Lucknow district, have been denied BPL cards despite repeatedly knocking the doors of higher authorities. Similar cases have also been reported from some other areas in the state, said Rai.

7,NSCN threatening ministers of Arunachal: Mithi,"ITANAGAR: The NSCN(I-M) was issuing threats to legislators and ministers of Tirap and Changlang districts in Arunachal Pradesh directing them to withdraw support to the government, Chief Minister Mukut Mithi said on Thursday.

The NSCN(I-M) militants issuing the threats were in Itanagar, he told reporters.

The threats were being made as both factions of the NSCN would be affected by the Arunachal Pradesh Control of Organised Crime Bill, 2002 moved in the Assembly on Wednesday, Mithi said.

The bill, which prescribed award of capital punishment or imprisonment for life and a minimum fine of Rs 1 lakh, would affect the NSCN, he said.

Deteriorating law and order, attempt to murder, rape, extortion, drug peddling and gang warfare between the NSCN Isaac-Muivah and Khaplang factions warranted introduction of the bill, he said earlier during question hour.

He denied former chief minister Gegong Apang''s allegations that the government had a hidden agenda in introducing the bill.

The Assembly also adopted by voice vote a resolution which declared that territorial integrity was non-negotiable and reminded the government that the Naga peace process would not affect any northeastern state.

The resolution moved by the chief minister said that the Centre was engaged in negotiations with the NSCN, which was responsible for insurgency in Arunachal Pradesh and was claiming most of the state''s territory as part of ''Nagalim'' (Greater Nagaland) and that most of its tribes were ''Nagas''.

It urged the Centre ""to entrench and enshrine its promise of not permitting the territorial integrity of Arunachal Pradesh to be affected by a suitable amendment to Article three of the Constitution of India, or by such other parliamentary measure as may be appropriate and binding.""

The chief minister said ""the territorial integrity of Arunachal Pradesh is non-negotiable as the state was never part of the Naga peace process.""

Mithi added that the Disturbed Area Act was enforced on Tirap and Changlang districts since September 17, 1991 as both witnessed encounters between security forces and the NSCN(I-M), NSCN(K) and Ulfa.

8,Jethmalani urges govt to defer polls,"HYDERABAD: Former Union law minister and chairman Kashmir Committee Ram Jethmalani urged the Union government to postpone the elections and hold talks with the Kashmiri militants, including Hurriyat Conference to sort out the Kashmir imbroglio.

Addressing a press conference here on Thursday, Jethmalani said many individual Kashmiri militants were expressing their willingness to join the national mainstream by participating in the elections. He said postponement of polls for some time would facilitate their participation.

Jethmalani said that Kashmir Resolution Front, an organisation of thirteen ex-militant groups, had expressed its willingness to participate in elections and it would be â€œpolitically idiotic to snub such elementsâ€� by rejecting the demand for postponement of polls.

Stating that the ball was in governmentâ€™s court, he said India would miss a opportunity forever, in case the separatist groups, including Hurriyat Conference, were not invited.

India should tell the world that it did its best to ensure greater participation of people in Kashmir polls and should not give any scope for any excuse for non-participation, he opined.

Jethmalani said that the Election Commission has the right to review the decision as the situation in Kashmir warranted postponement of elections and it would be an error of law to reject postponement of elections on the plea that poll process was set in motion.

He regretted that Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee or the Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani had failed to protect the CEC Lyngdoh from â€œintemperate and unwarranted attacksâ€� from various quarters in regard to his decision on holding of elections in Gujarat.

9,Mayor pulls up party colleague,"KOLKATA: Trinamul Congress chief whip in the West Bengal Assembly Sobhandeb Chattopadhyay, who is also a senior security officer of the Kolkata Municipal Corporation, was on Thursday issued a show-cause notice by mayor Subrata Mukherjee, his party colleague.

The reason? Chattopadhyay allegedly misbehaved with municipal commissioner Debasis Som for transferring an employee belonging to his union.

The mayor also gave the green signal for the suspension of five members of the KMC Employees and Workers Union.

They had allegedly taken out a rally in the â€œno-entryâ€� corridor of the KMC headquarters during working hours. Chattopadhyay is the general secretary of the union.

â€œNo one is above discipline. The municipal commissioner had wished to resign because of the ill treatment from a responsible trade union leader. In such a situation I canâ€™t sit idle,â€� the mayor said on Thursday afternoon.

Though Som refused to comment, sources in his office said that he felt humiliated after Chattopadhyay threatened him.

Chattopadhyay said he did nothing wrong. He was only protesting against the â€œillegalâ€� transfer of his union member.

11,"Police, railways clash over auction","KOLKATA: If the police are to be believed, railway auctions have led to a number of mafia groups sprouting in Howrah, leading to murders, extortions and other crimes.

The police claimed that despite repeated requests, they have not received any help from the railways in weeding out such elements.

On Tuesday, the situation got worse at an auction in the Golmohur Railway Institute. Members of the Eastern Railway Officersâ€™ Association claimed that Sanjay Kumar, district controller of stores, Halisahar, was assaulted by the police while he was leaving the auction.

â€œThe railway officer was leaving in a huff. He pushed the deputy superintendent of police on duty. The police mistook him for a mafia gang member and took him into custody. The officer, being of the same rank as the DSP, probably thought the matter would not take a serious turn,â€� explained Howrah superintendent of police Rajesh Kumar.

For once, it seemed that the police were generous and allowed the press to enter the place, â€˜prohibitedâ€™, by the railways. Aware of reports of alleged â€˜mafiaâ€™ activities, journalists of some television channels wanted to capture the auction on camera. The railways asked them to deposit Rs 5,000 as earnest money.

â€œThe district police had told us about the activities at such auctions. We saw the advertisement in the newspaper and went there. The officers asked us for earnest money. When we told them that we were from the Press. They then asked us to leave,â€� said a TV journalist.

The officers complained to the police about the reporters. â€œThe police told the railwaymen that as it was an open auction anyone could enter. Railway officers stopped the auction and trouble began,â€� said the reporter.

â€œReporters had told me that they would be present at the auction. Everyone knows about mafia activity at such events and a large police force was present. We could neither stop the Press from visiting, nor could we do anything to stop the filming. So, the railway officers stopped the auction,â€� claimed Kumar.

â€œWe did not invite anybody though it is true that extortions, murders and other crimes have increased in Howrah owing to the mafia hand in the auctions. We have asked the railways for help but to no avail,â€� sighed Kumar.

17,US backs India on J&K polls,"NEW DELHI: Visiting US Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage told his Indian counterparts on Friday that the US, too, believed that there had been some change in infiltration ``in the wrong direction'''' in recent weeks and that he would take up the issue with the Pakistani authorities in Islamabad on Saturday.

In his exchanges with officials, Armitage also strongly endorsed India''s steps to hold ``free and fair'''' elections in Jammu and Kashmir.

The US official was responding to the concern expressed by the Indian officials over the rise in infiltration from Pakistan in recent weeks. They also conveyed their determination to firmly deal with any attempts at disrupting the coming J&K elections.

India had ``ample evidence'''' that more attempts at infiltration were planned as the election process got underway.

Armitage had an hour-long meeting with Defence Minister George Fernandes and later held detailed meetings with National Security Adviser Brajesh Mishra and foreign secretary Kanwal Sibal.

He briefed them about US'' plans on Iraq and assured them that the US would take into account India''s concerns. President Bush, he told his Indian interlocutors, ``wants to take all views into consideration'''' before making any move.

India expressed a deep sense of disappointment that Islamabad was not keeping its word to stop cross-border terrorism and had, in fact, stepped up attempts to push in militants to disrupt the J&K poll process.

Fernandes, officials said, told Armitage that the elections, despite threats held out from across the border, were evoking a fair response among the militancy-weary people of the state.

The Defence Minister also told the US official about the government''s determination to go ahead with holding of free, fair and credible elections.

Fernandes told Armitage that if Pakistan did not stop its activities to push in militants, it would be hard for New Delhi to ease border deployment.

In the absence of External Affairs Minister Yashwant Sinha, who is away in Dhaka, foreign secretary Kanwal Sibal held detailed talks with Armitage lasting nearly 100 minutes. The spokesperson said that the focus at all meetings was on bilateral, international, regional security issues.

Sibal, just back from his visit to four major centres in Afghanistan - Kabul, Kandahar, Mazar-e-Sharif and Herat - gave his assessment of the situation.

High on the list were the efforts at rehabilitation and reconstruction of the Afghan society. Both sides recognised the challenges confronting the Afghan society and those who want to assist the process of development there.

As there was ``a high degree of convergence'''', the spokesperson said that both India and the US would intensify their mutual consultations on this as the situation evolved in Afghanistan.

China also figured high in the parleys between Armitage and Sibal. Both sides apprised each other of the respective bilateral ties with Beijing.

Armitage, who came here from Sri Lanka, gave his assessment of the developments there. He also heard the Indian standpoint, which is highly supportive of the ongoing peace process in the neighbouring country.

This had been recommended by Dr D.N. Nanjundappa Committee, constituted by the government, for redressal of the regional imbalance.

N.S. Bhosaraju, the president of HKDB, said the committee had said 27 out of 39 assembly constituencies of Hyderabad-Karnataka area were most backward compared with the other constituencies in the state.

The report has further said the government should provide Rs 6,400 crore to these constituencies to bring them on par with other constituencies.

A memorandum in this regard would be submitted on behalf of the board during the chief minister''s visit here on Saturday, the board chairman said.

On the committee''s recommendation to scrap all regional development boards, including HKDB as they have not been functioning working satisfactorily, he said in its previous meeting, the board had requested the CM not to accept the committee''s recommendation as most areas in the region still remained backward.

The board has requested the chief minister to strengthen the board by giving more financial allocation.

The memorandum will also ask chief minister to take an all-party delegation to the capital to meet Prime Minister A.B. Vajpayee Prime Minister to urge him for an amendment to Article 371 of Constitution for providing special reservation in education and employment sectors for students of Hyderabad-Karnataka region.

The region consists of Bidar, Gulbarga, Raichur and Koppal districts.

The government has sent a proposal to the Centre in this regard, he said. The board president said a memorandum will also be submitted to Home Minister L.K. Advani during his visit here on September 2.

The memorandum to the chief minister will also seek a high court bench at Gulbarga.

Bhosaraju said the CM will inaugurate the newly constructed building of HKDB, built at an estimated cost of Rs 1.25 crore.

20,CM to have new principal secretary,"BANGALORE: After having had a smooth run in day-to-day administration in his secretariat ever since he took over as CM in October 1999, Krishna now has to choose a new Principal Secretary, with the present incumbent S.V. Ranganath opting for a central deputation.

Ranganath will take over as Joint Secretary (Finance) in the Department of Space for a five-year tenure. The office is in Bangalore.

Sources said names of the Principal Secretaries of two departments, Chiranjeevi Singh (Finance) and B.K. Das (Urban Development), and Krishna''s Secretary M.K. Shankaralinge Gowda are under consideration for the coveted post, but no decision has been taken yet. ``The change is most likely to take place only after Krishna returns from US, but a sudden decision is also not ruled out,'''' sources told this reporter.

Krishna is reportedly keen on appointing Gowda, but may be forced to have second thoughts due to caste considerations. Both Krishna and Gowda are Vokkaligas and the CM''s secretariat already has a good number of staff belonging to that community.

``There are no guidelines or regulations for appointing a principal secretary as it is the CM''s prerogative,'''' the sources added.

21,No joy for right bank canal farmers,"MYSORE: Although the Kabini Dam has filled to the brim and excess water is being released into the river bed, ironically, farmers of Kabini Right Bank Canal (RBC) have no water for irrigation.

It is said the dam authorities were releasing more than 40,000 cusecs into the river bed but not a drop into RBC, which irrigates fields in T. Narasipur, Kollegal and Yelandur taluks.

The move has come as a surprise to farmers affected by drought.

Leaders say, the irrigation department promised to release water into the canal last week following the farmers gheraoing officials. But for reasons best known to them alone, no water has been released.

Raitha Hitarakshana Samiti leader Kurubur Shantakumar told The Times of India in many areas, the paddy nurseries have dried up. Farmers have failed to protect nurseries causing heavy losses, he stated.

According to farmers, nurseries are raised in June and transplanting done in July and August. This time, they are yet to get water. They will not get the expected yield if transplantation is done next month.

Meanwhile, the KRRS leaders have threatened to picket the irrigation department offices if engineers failed to release water into the RBC immediately.

``By this time, the department officials would have announced the water release scheme and allowed farmers to take up cultivation of paddy,'''' they said, adding the irrigation department officials had bungled in releasing water.

However, the department sources claimed they have been releasing water into the RBC for the last 15 days and described farmers'' claim as ``false and baseless''.
