According to fellow jawans, Mahendra was denied leave earlier too. He had sought leave for the same purpose but the alliance did not work out as he couldn''t reach in time. ""So, when he was refused leave this time, he was pretty disturbed,"" they said.

At 4:45 am, gunshots woke up PAC jawans. They found Mahendra with his service gun, attempting to shoot himself. Before they could do anything, he pulled the trigger and killed himself.

5,Riot case against state education minister to stay,"NEW DELHI: A city court has refused to accept an application withdrawing a nine-year-old riot case pending against Delhi state minister for education, Raj Kumar Chauhan.

Gurdeep Singh Saini declined to accept the prosecution plea which said the case should closed to maintain peace and harmony. Saini, however, said that Chauhan had misused his authority and being a political leader he ought not to have violated the law.

The incident of rioting dates back to September 18, 1994. The case was registered at the Mongolpuri police station. The allegations state that Chauhan had slapped an assistant sub-inspector and obstructed him from doing his duty.

According to the case, Chauhan went to the police station when assistant sub-inspector, Bhim Singh, arrested one Sukhbir Singh on charges that he had allegedly fought with a woman, Sashi who complained to the police.

When the ASI took Singh to the police station, Chauhan reached there and accused the police officer of accepting a bribe from Sashi. He abused and slapped the officer too.

On December 2, 2000, the court framed charges against him. While the case was still at evidence stage, the prosecution moved an application to withdraw the proceedings.

On Wednesday, however, Saini held that the leader failed to follow the law and has declined to withdraw the case.

6,Trishul Deeksha launched with eye on polls: NCP,"KOCHI: Nationalist Congress Party on Friday said that the VHP had launched its ''Trishul Deeksha'' programme to woo the majority community vote bank in the four states where assembly elections are due later this year.

""Distribution of Trishul will lead to communal polarisation of votes,"" NCP national general secretary T Peethambaran told a press conference here.

To give a tough fight to BJP in the Lok Sabha elections due next year, NCP was taking steps to bring together secular minded parties under a single platform, he said.

Asked if this meant NCP would join hands with Congress, he said nothing could be said beforehand. To stop BJP from coming back to power, ""we are ready to cooperate with other secular parties,"" he said.

Claiming that there would be an exodus from the Congress to NCP in Chattisgarh, Bihar and Gujarat, he said even in Kerala, there were workers keen to join NCP.

On India-Pakistan relations, he said the NCP welcomed the thawing of ice between the two countries.

On the Marad violence in which nine persons were killed, he said it was ""a well planned intentional attack.""

NCP''s two-day convention will be held in Delhi from May 29. National President Sharad Pawar would attend the party''s state conference at Kozhikode on May 15, he added.

7,Consensus eludes TDP elections,"HYDERABAD: The results of the TDP district committee elections, which were scheduled to be announced on Friday, have been postponed to Saturday due to lack of consensus among various groups in certain districts.

According to party sources, the election of the district committee presidents in Guntur, Kadapa, Warangal and Vijayawada (urban) had been delayed due to differences among various groups. In Guntur, the incumbent district convener Y Venkat Rao is facing opposition from legislators D Narendra Kumar and M Peddarathaiah who are in the race for the post.

MP Rammuni Reddy is opposing the continuation of Kadapa district TDP chief K Sivananda Reddy, while Telugu Mahila state secretary G Sudha Rani is trying to replace Kadapa district convener M Rammohan Rao. Vijayawada (urban) convener Basaweswara Rao is facing stiff opposition from Katargadda Babu and Nagul Meera who are also in the race.

In some districts, the bigwigs were trying to get their nominees elected for the party posts, according to TDP sources.

The sources added that adequate representation has not been given to the weaker sections and women in various districts as per the party guidelines leading to a delay in announcing the results. Chief minister Chandrababu Naidu reportedly expressed displeasure at the lack of consensus among the leaders in finalising the candidates for party posts and conclude the organisational polls.

8,Engg students want new fee rule scrapped,"HYDERABAD: Various student organisations have launched an agitation against the government decision to fix the admission fee for engineering courses at Rs 22,000.

Members of the Joint Action Committee of Student Unions on Thursday burnt an effigy of the state government at Basheerbagh. Now they have threatened to hold an indefinite state-wide agitation.

As against the earlier two slabs of fee structure â€” free seats at Rs 8,000 inclusive of a development fee of Rs 3,000; and Rs 43,000 for payment seats inclusive of a development fee of Rs 8,000 â€” the government has scrapped the free seats. Instead, a common fee structure has been evolved. Irrespective of a candidate being meritorious or poor, he or she has to pay a fee of Rs 22,000.

Even if the candidate has secured the first rank or the last in the engineering, agriculture, medical common entrance test (Eamcet), the fee charged from all will be the same.

â€œWe are against the government decision as it is not in the interest of the meritorious and poor students,â€� All India Students Federation (AISF) vice-president D Harish said.

Opposing the common fee structure and to suggest an alternative to the government a meeting will be held at Visakhapatnam, ABVP secretary B Bhaskar said.

9,"Call off strike, govt urges Oppn","HYDERABAD: The state government on Friday appealed to the trade unions and opposition parties to call off their proposed strike on May 21. The government termed the state-wide bandh call as a durmargapu charya.

Information and public relations minister S Chandramohan Reddy, addressing a press conference here, said the accusation by the opposition parties that the drought-affected areas in the state were receiving inadequate relief was baseless. â€œNo government in the country has taken up so many drought-relief measures and poverty-alleviation programmes for the needy in the last seven years,â€™â€™ he said. By extending support to the strike, the Congress was preventing relief measures from reaching the needy, he said.

10,Private colleges object to Karnataka govt draft rules for admission,"BANGALORE: Private engineering, medical and dental colleges on Friday filed several objections to the state governmentâ€™s draft rules for admission to professional colleges.

Terming the rules as wholly misconceived, illegal and unconstitutional, managements have said: â€œIt is not competent for the state government either to regulate admissions or the tuition fee chargeable in a private unaided institution. The draft rules grossly violate the constitutional guarantees and Supreme Court judgment.â€™â€™

Quoting the SC judgment, managements have said any system of studentsâ€™ selection would be unreasonable if it deprives private unaided institutions the right of rational selection, which it devised for itself. â€œThe proposed draft rules are in the teeth of the SC judgment because they call for surrendering the total process of selection to the state.â€™â€™

Higher education secretary K.P. Pandey told The Times of India the government would examine all the objections before notifying the rules on May 15. On the managementsâ€™ argument that they cannot run their colleges with the proposed fee structure, Pandey said: â€œHow were they running the colleges for so many years? The government is prepared to defend itself even if the managements go to court.â€™â€™

CM takes stiff stand: Chief minister S.M. Krishna on Friday said it was for managements to approach the government for talks related to confusion in admission to professional colleges.

Krishna told reporters during an inspection at the Vidhana Soudha annexe here: â€œThey are running the colleges. So they must come to the government and seek clarifications. We cannot approach them for talks.â€™â€™

12,Pipavav rly project expected to increase cargo traffic,"AHMEDABAD: The Pipavav Railway Corporation Limited (PRCL), the first private sector railway initiative to be commissioned on May 11 by deputy prime minister L K Advani, is targeting a breakeven after 3-4 years on a projected average annual cargo traffic of three million tonnes per annum.

""With the Pipavav Port already handling an average 2.5 million tonnes of cargo annually, the rail link is expected to lead to a surge in cargo traffic. Further, with Pipavav being closer than JNPT we expect a lot of traffic to be diverted to Pipavav with the completion of the project,"" PRCL director Bhavesh Gandhi told TNN.

According to him, the rail link would give Gujarat Pipavav Port Limited (GPPL) total access to the northern hinterland and north markets and would also enable Pipavav Port to handle additional cargo like rice and wheat. Till now, Pipavav Port has been handling cargo comprising coal, cement, fertiliser raw material, steel coils, de-oil cakes and containers.

PRCL, a 50:50 joint venture between the ministry of railways and Gujarat Pipavav Port Limited, has converted a 271-km railway track between Pipavav and Surendranagar to broad-gauge, including a new broad-gauge link of 21 kms between Rajula and Pipavav Port.

The project has been put up at a cost of Rs 373 crore, of which Rs 200 crore is by way of equity (shared equally by GPPL and Indian Railways) and Rs 173 crore by way of debt funded by HUDCO, Indian Railway Finance Corporation, Bank of Maharashtra, GIC and United Bank of India.

PRCL, put up as a special purpose vehicle for the rail link project, has the rights to develop, operate and maintain the Surendranagar-Pipavav railway line on a BOOT (build-own-operatetransfer) basis for 33 years under a concession agreement with the ministry of railways.

13,"State govt, Columbia University sign pact","GANDHINAGAR: Columbia University''s Center for Globalisation & Sustainable Development and the Gujarat government signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) on Friday to initiate research for developing a growth model for the state''s economy and promote foreign direct investment (FDI).

The Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, will be part of the research project.

Columbia University professor Jeffrey D Sachs told reporters after signing the agreement that Gujarat does not face any ""intrinsic problem"" for development as it has a long coastline, an urbanised culture and is close to Mumbai â€” India''s commercial capital.

""This is the second long-term project that we have undertaken with any state in India. The first was with Tamil Nadu,"" he said.

The research would involve finding out the impact of human rights and social development issues on the economic development of Gujarat. ""Peace and social stability are a precondition for development. Protection of women''s rights is also very important,"" Sachs said. He added, ""While industry and agriculture are well-developed, the state lags behind in historical, cultural and beach tourism.""

The research project would also include seismology, climate and drought conditions, and agricultural forecasting. ""Seismologist Arthur Lerner-Lan and hydrologist Ubmanu Lal will be involved in the research,"" Sachs said.

""We will also be seeking the help of the Indian Diaspora in the US, particularly those in New York where I am based, during the research,"" he said.

To a query on prohibition, Sachs said, ""I have just come to know about prohibition in Gujarat. We will look into its impact on the state''s economy, too.""

The MoU was signed at Sachivalaya by Sachs, state official Nethra Shenoy and IIM-A director Bakul Dholakia in the presence of Chief Minister Narendra Modi.

14,EC for law to make parties accountable to people,"AHMEDABAD: The Election Commission (EC) is in favour of a new legislation to guide the conduct and functioning of political parties to make them accountable to the people.

With three states going to the polls soon and the Lok Sabha elections due next year, the commission feels such a law will address issues that have created public apprehensions in the election process vis-Ã -vis source of funds of political parties, their expenditure and selection of candidates. The EC is also contemplating utilising NGOs for conducting elections.

""It is desirable to have a comprehensive law that would ensure that political parties function in a democratic manner, explain their source of funds, the kind of expenditure they incur and make them accountable to the people for their actions,"" says election commissioner T S Krishnamurthy. He was speaking at the first national workshop on ""Electoral reforms and right to information"" organised by the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR), that began here on Saturday.

""The laws in this regard are scattered and there are loopholes disallowing free and fair polls to be conducted. This has to be addressed and can be done with the help of voluntary agencies,"" he adds.

""Political parties talk of globalisation and free market. They should themselves come out openly in the free market of democracy,"" says Krishnamurthy, who feels that political parties should come clean in two areas â€” their source of funds and selection of candidates.

He adds, ""They should also carry out research for proper study of governance issues. It is time for political parties do some introspection and bring about self-regulation or there will be chaotic consequences in form of riots and rebellion.""

He informed that the idea of using voluntary organisations to conduct elections has its pitfalls too. ""Persons may masquerade as NGOs with political biases. We will have to work out a way to ensure such bodies are unbiased,"" he says.

The EC is also planning to publicise electoral rolls so that more people have access to them. While the urban populace can access them on-line and through CR-ROMs made available to cybercafes, the panchayats may be used to reach out to the rural masses. Talks are also on with the ministry of posts to use post offices for the purpose. Krishnamurthy lamented the ""indifference of the elite"".

""Many a times, good candidates have lost due to low voter turnout and it has also been seen in the case of photo identity cards.We have found rural areas more aware in this regard than their urban counterparts,"" he says.

15,FICCI getting closer to state govt,"AHMEDABAD: The Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) is getting into top gear in Gujarat. In a significant move, signalling the growing closeness of FICCI with Chief Minister Narendra Modi, FICCI is now moving closer to Gandhinagar by moving its offices from Vadodara to Ahmedabad.

Not only that, it has hired former CII (Gujarat Council) director Dipankar Roy to head its operations in Gujarat as director.

Coming as it does in the wake of the recent Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) spat with Modi, the move also comes close on the heels of the recent visit of FICCI top brass to Gujarat and a meet organised in Delhi by FICCI to promote investment in Gujarat.

FICCI is working closely with GoG with a three-day global investors summit planned to coincide with Navratri aimed at pushing Gujarat as an attractive investment destination.

Though present in Gujarat through its member chambers like the Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry, it was only in mid 2001 that FICCI set up an independent office in Gujarat at Vadodara.
