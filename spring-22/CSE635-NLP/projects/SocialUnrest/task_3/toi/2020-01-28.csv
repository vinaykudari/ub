0,SUCI shuns any role in government,"KOLKATA: What would the SUCI do, if it was asked to form the government in West Bengal and was entrusted with the task of solving the financial crisis without ever increasing service charges? Once a partner of the CPM in the United Front government in the late 1960s, the SUCI's answer in 2003 is crisp and categorical. ""We refuse to be a part of the government which is clearly pro-industry and antipoor. We refuse to be a part of the Left Front, which is against all forms of genuine struggle by the poor,"" says SUCI state secretary Probhash Ghosh. ""Had we been in the government now, instead of putting the entire financial burden on the poor and the middle classes, we would have pulled out. Any genuine Marxist party would do that,"" Ghosh insisted. With the two telephones in the party office ringing constantly, bringing in reports of success of the 24-hour Bangla bandh and arrest of party activists and leaders, Probash Ghosh and his comrades were clearly a happy lot on Monday evening. They had dared the the CPM and the police in ignoring the appeal of the Left Front that the bandh be called off. They were unsure of success, for barely two weeks ago, another bandh on similar issues had been forced on the people of this state. The SUCI leader is committed in his belief that the Left Front government had many options other than raising service charges, education and hospital fees. Withdrawal of cross subsidy in the power sector could also have been avoided, he feels. The government can save Rs 50,000 crore by slashing fat salaries of the bureaucrats, perks of the ministers and by reducing the police budget and removing tax holidays for industrialists, he insists. ""The government is spending over Rs 500,000 every month for the security of former chief minister Jyoti Basu. Most of the ministers are using air-conditioned cars. Government fund is being used to finance the CPM. Had the government stopped such misuse of funds, there would not be any need to increase taxes and charges,"" Ghosh said. But won't repeated bandhs such as these scare away potential investors ? This is a deliberate misinformation campaign feels Ghosh. ""The militant Left movement was at its peak during the Congress regime. Yet, West Bengal, then, was at the top of the industrial map.""

1,"Pota being misused by government, says SP","LUCKNOW: The Samajwadi Party om Monday condemned in the strongest possible terms the imposition of Pota on jailed MLA Raghuraj Pratap Singh and his father Uday Pratap Singh by the Mayawati government. It maintained that the Act was being misused by the chief minister for her vested interests.

Addressing a press conference, state president Ram Sharan Das said the party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav had voiced his opposition to the Act in the Parliament and had said that it would be used for victimising political opponents by the party in power.

What had been said by Yadav was holding true today, he said and added that the Act was meant for people who indulged in anti-national activities and not for civilians.

Das alleged there were more than a dozen ministers in Mayawatiâ€™s cabinet who had criminal antecedents and queried why Pota was not being imposed on them.

He said the kind of witch hunting indulged in by Mayawati would set a bad precedent as any government which came to power would not hesitate to impose the draconian Act on its political adversary.

Das lauded the demonstration staged by the SP activists in front of the Council House. The party workers had raised anti-Mayawati slogans and demanded the withdrawal of Pota against Rahguraj and his father.

Led by senior leader Bhagwati Singh and city president Faqir Siddiqui, they took out a procession from the Kaiserbagh city office. They were later dispersed by the police which used mild force for the purpose.

Referring to the killings near the Kalinjar Fort in Banda, Das said a five-member team, led by leader of Opposition in the Vidhan Parishad Ahmed Hasan would reach the site on January 28 for an on-the-spot assessment of the ghastly incident.

He said dacoits like Dadua and Sattu Lodhi were operating in the area and had full protection from the local leaders. He added that BSP had five ministers from that region.

Das also condemned the lathi-charge on the Bhartiya Kisan Union president Mahendra Singh Tikait and termed it as an anti-democratic step.

2,Mining is going on but as per law: Haryana,"NEW DELHI: Haryana government, on being chastised by the Supreme Court, admitted on Monday that mining was going on in certain areas of the state but said there was no violation of ban orders, as it was being carried out in accordance with law.

The central empowered committee (CEC), however, submitted before a bench comprising justice Y K Sabharwal and justice H K Sema that largescale mining, blasting and transportation of minerals was continuing in the eco-fragile Aravali hills in Gurgaon and Faridabad districts, in violation of court orders.

Appearing for the mining lease holders, senior advocate Shanti Bhushan said the mining was being carried

out strictly in accordance with the law and was only in those areas which didnot fall under the restricted forest area.

Haryana counsel Gopal Subramaniam submitted that of the total area of 217.85 hectares in the Sirohi-Khori Jamalpur, mining was

confined to only 82.10 hectares.

The bench, to resolve the issue after hearing all concerned parties, fixed February 11 for final hearing of the matter and allowed the committee to file its report by February 8.

3,'Disinvestment will not affect project',"BATHINDA: After the cabinet committee on disinvestment, on Sunday, gave the go ahead for privatisation of Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL), by sale of equity to a strategic partner and Bharat Petroleum Limited through a public offer, the Punjab government expressed hope on Monday that the construction of the Rs 9,000 crore HPCL''s Bhatinda refinery would not be affected by the disinvestment decision.

Quoting disinvestment minister Arun Shourie, committee on fiscal reforms and financial reconstruction and resources chairman Surinder Singla said in a press conference, that disinvestment in HPCL and BPCL would not affect refinery project at Bathinda. The project would be built either by the strategic partner or else by the government through the Indian Oil Corporation or ONGC. He said that Rs 400 crore have already been invested in the Bhatinda refinery.

Singla added that in a telephonic conversation with Shourie on Monday, the latter had assured that as per the cabinet committee''s decision, the government would go ahead with Bathinda and Bina refinery. Singla claimed that after the Punjab government, particularly chief minister Amarinder Singh, pursued the matter earnestly with the Centre, the government decided not to abandon the project. Giving reference of Shourie, Singla said that the project, which was hanging in balance for the last more than five years, would be completed in three years.

He blamed the poor-performance of SAD-BJP, during the last five years in not pursuing the project properly, for the avoidable delay and also for the financial loss of excise duty to Punjab. The project would earn Punjab over Rs 1,000 crore annually as excise duty on the petroleum goods, he added.

Singla denied that there was any delay on the part of Punjab government in signing the deed of assurance for a year. He claimed that after the state cabinet gave its approval, he along with the chief minister, took up the matter immediately with HPCL for signing the deed of assurance. He said that Akali''s claim of taking credit for the refinery was a shameless act as the project was approved in 1996 by the then Congress government in the centre.

4,Cong veteran Chhajed becomes a minister,"PUNE: It took a dramatic change of guard on the sixth floor of Mantralaya to open up a ministerial berth for the 51-year-old Congress veteran, Chandrakant Chhajed.

And it also took years of unflinching loyalty to Suresh Kalmadi. Chhajed, fondly referred to as ""Mamu"" in political circles, went to the extent of quitting the Congress along with Kalmadi in December 1997.

A past-master in civic politics, Chhajed not only backed Kalmadi''s Pune Vikas Aghadi, but also contested, albeit unsuccessfully, the 1998 Lok Sabha elections as an independent candidate on Kalmadi''s bidding. He stood by Kalmadi through an 18-month phase of political wilderness between 1998 and 1999.

A corporator for five terms and also former mayor, Chhajed was for the first time elected as an MLA, as the official Congress candidate from Bopodi, in the last assembly elections (1999).

There too, he benefited from Pawar''s dramatic exit from the Congress in May 1999 over the issue of party president Sonia Gandhi''s foreign origins. Had Pawar stayed with the Congress, Rambhau Moze, the threetime MLA from Bopodi, would have kept the seat.

The former lawyer from Bopodi seems to have mastered fine-tuned the art of choosing the right leader during his long stint in the civic body. As city mayor in 1987-88, Chhajed remained a close-aide of the late V.N. Gadgil who represented Pune in the Lok Sabha and was the Congress spokesperson for many years.

Sensing Gadgil''s decline, he switched over to the rising star in the party, Suresh Kalmadi.

As Kalmadi''s most trusted lieutenant in the city, Chhajed became leader of the House in the Pune municipal corporation (PMC) in 1992. His abilities as an excellent floor manager saw him retain the post for a decade.

In 1996, Chhajed lost his petrol pump allocation following the supreme court''s ruling in the Satish Sharma petrol pump scam. However, he managed to get it back in an open auction with the help of his ""friends and wellwishers."" Known for his understanding of legalities of sensitive decisions, as much as his political acumen, Chhajed has been a popular leader in his camp as well as his voters.

A regular at many of the city''s temples, Chhajed is interested in astrology as well as ayurveda (Murli Manohar Joshi to note). He not only sorts out sundry matters for his voters, he is known to have cured some of them of physical ailments.

Despite his track record, he had trouble getting a ticket for his son, Anand, in the last municipal election, due to infighting. In fact, Anand and other Congress nominees on the panel, eventually lost the poll. Those days seem to be over for ministerji.

5,Gopinath Munde to renew protest 'yatra',"MUMBAI: BJP leader Gopinath Munde will tour western Maharashtra next month as part of a ''Sangharsha Yatra'' to highlight the alleged failures of the Democratic Front (DF) government.

Munde will tour the region between February 20 and 26. This will be followed by a visit to the Konkan region between March 4 and 8, Maharashtra BJP spokesman Prakash Javdekar told reporters. Earlier, Munde had undertaken a whirlwind tour of southern Maharashtra, Khandesh, Marathwada and Vidarbha.

""The change of leadership by the Congress will not make any qualitative difference in life for the general public. Therefore, Munde will highlight the people''s genuine grievances,"" the spokesman added.

Claiming that the first leg of the yatra had managed to pressure the government to pay cotton farmers a minimum price of Rs 2,300 per quintal, the spokesman said energy minister Padamsingh Patil was divested of the portfolio.

6,Doctor's remark on family planning irks minister,"MOTIHARI: The inaugural function of â€œNational Family Welfare and Health Melaâ€�, organised under the aegis of IMA and central health department jointly, turned out to be an interesting event as people got the opportunity to watch health education minister Shakeel Ahmad, and his one time teacher, IMAâ€™s state chief Dr Raman Prasad Sinha, in a question-answer session.

Sinha thanked C P Thakur, former Union health minister, for the success of the mela. He said the IMA members are always willing to render services with a rider that the state government should first repose confidence in the doctors.

He did not mince words in saying that family planning programme failed because of the practice of fixing targets of operation.

This remark visibly upset the minister, Shakil Ahmad, as he got up and said he is also a doctor and though Dr Sinha had been his â€˜guruâ€™, he is a part of administration now and does not agree with his teacherâ€™s theory.

He said that when the target of family planning operation was fixed by the Congress government, the population was well under control. â€œThe moment the target was removed by the non-Congress governments, the population figures went up,â€� the minister said.

He said the state government has decided again to fix the operation targets for the government doctors.

Interestingly enough, BJP MP Radha Mohan Singh, who was to be the chief guest at the function, did not attend the function.

7,Iffco increases market share in state: Official,"PATNA: The director of Indian Farmersâ€™ Fertiliser Cooperative (Iffco), Ajit Kumar Singh, underlined the need of taking farmersâ€™ benefit programmes like soil testing to Gram Panchayat and village level so that more farmers could be benefited by it.

Inaugurating the state level advisory committee meeting of Iffco here on Saturday, he said the Iffcoâ€™s share in the market of Bihar has increased from 5 per cent to 33 per cent, which should not only be consolidated but increased also.

â€œThis can be done only through various training programmes â€” crop diversification and other programmes â€” to create awareness among farmers,â€� he said.

Speaking as a chief guest registrar of the cooperative societies Amitabh Verma said that the Primary Agriculture Credit and Cooperative Societies (PACS) should be revived.

â€œIt should be brought into the mainstream through distribution of fertilisers and foodgrain procurement,â€� he said.

He further said, â€œin order to make on-the-spot registration of small cooperative societies and granting of licences for fertilisers, district magistrates should be directed to organise meetings at the district headquarters with sale tax officers.â€�

State marketing manager B M Sharma welcomed the guests on the occasion and introduced his successor R N Thakur to the advisory committee members.

The meeting reviewed the sale of fertilisers in the state in the current year and discussed various programmes for the coming season.

Prominent among other speakers were Madhubani MLA Ramdeo Mahto, Sudesh Kumar Singh and Nawal Kishore Singh.

8,Give Cong full majority in next polls: Shinde,"PUNE: In his first public address after taking over as chief minister of Maharashtra, Sushilkumar Shinde has appealed to the people to elect the Congress with a full majority in the Assembly elections in 2004.

Promising to turn around the state''s economy in his current term, Shinde said it was a matter of regret for him that he was heading a jumbo ministry at a time when the state''s finances were at its worst.

""I promise you that the strength of my ministry will not exceed 25 if you give full majority to the Congress in the next polls,"" Shinde said while speaking at the Congress Bhavan here.

He said that Maharashtra''s finances were in a surplus when he left the state in 1990, after holding the finance portfolio. ""What has happened happened since then is a result of bad planning, lack of priorities and inexperience in governance,"" he said in an obvious criticism of the erstwhile Shiv Sena-BJP government.

Shinde said his priority would be to ""work like the fire brigade"" and undertake immediate, shortterm planning to restore the state''s finances.

The newly-appointed chief minister''s brief address to party workers reflected sincerity, as he promised to strengthen secular values, attend to the problems of the poor and work closely with the party.

Shinde, who was accompanied by the new state party unit chief Ranjit Deshmukh, displayed a firm resolve to carry the party along with the government.

He lauded the efforts of the unsung party workers and the Pune unit chief Mohan Joshi, and said he would first go the party office while visiting any new town or city. ""I have always been a party worker and I do not want the party worker in me to die,"" he said.

Speaking about his priorities, Shinde said he would convene a highlevel meeting to address the environmental and infrastructural issues of Pune, Nagpur, Aurangabad and Nashik. He said that he had already taken up the issue of Mumbai''s problems and future development at a high-level meeting on Sunday.

The chief minister criticised Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mayawati for taking up the issue of renaming Amethi after Shahu Maharaj of Kolhapur who had helped uplift the poor and the downtrodden. ""As a Dalit chief minister, will you solve the problems of the Dalits, or will you only go about raising memorials,"" he asked of Mayawati while criticising her.

He said Amethi was famously associated with the Nehru-Gandhi family and to rename it as Shahuji Maharaj district is wrong as ""the people there don''t know anything about Shahu Maharaj,"" he said.

While stating that he was aware of Pune''s environmental, transportation and developmental problems, Shinde said that as in the case with Mumbai, he would establish a committee to address these and other problems facing the city.

He also indicated that he would resolve the problem of six-seater autorickshaw drivers who were banned from plying their vehicles within the civic limits in Pune. ""Whether it is the six-seater or three-seater auto drivers, they are all poor people. They are not begging on the streets, but earning a honest livelihood. I will attend to their problem,"" he said.

Shinde began his visit to the city by paying homage to the memorials of Jyotiba Phule, Lokmanya Tilak and Kasturba Gandhi. During Monday''s function, Shinde was presented with a cheque for Rs 50,000 by the Pune Congress committee, towards drought relief.

9,Court fumes at CM's principal secretary for 'lapses',"PATNA: In a major indictment of Mukund Prasad, former chief secretary and present principal secretary to the chief minister, the Patna High Court on Monday said that cigarette is injurious to health but Prasad is injurious to the state administration.

A single bench of Justice S K Katriar, while hearing a bunch of petitions filed by retired government employees for retirement benefits, resented the â€œlingering shadowâ€� of Prasad on the state administration. He continues to run the state administration, the judge said.

Justice Katriar asked Prasad why only class III and IV government employees had to face problems in getting retirement benefits. Almost 99.9 per cent of such cases pending in the court were of these employees. Over 5,000 contempt of court cases related to these benefits were pending, the judge observed regretting that the government failed to comply with the court orders.

Chief secretary S N Biswas, finance commissioner U N Panjiyar, the law secretary and the chairman of the Bihar State Electricity Board were also present in the court. Prasadâ€™s plea that when he was chief secretary he was not being informed in time by the standing counsel about the pending cases related to non-settlement of retirement benefits, appeared to further irk the judge. â€œWhat kind of governance were you heading in which even your counsel was not briefing you properly?â€�

Prasad sought permission to say something. â€œIf the judge and the private lawyer wish, I am ready to quit my post,â€� he offered.

An unimpressed judge, however, replied that it was not the courtâ€™s concern whether he resigns or not. â€œThe main concern of the court is that on your retirement as the chief secretary on January 31, 2002, the number of cases related to retirement benefits was 2043 which rose to 3,317 on January 21, 2003, he said, adding the number of contempt of court cases has gone to 5,552.

Panjiyar assured the bench that he would soon designate an officer to head the pension cell of the government, who would look into all the pending pension cases.

The bench observed that rules should be amended so that the superannuated employees got their dues soon after retirement.

The hearing will resume on Tuesday.

One of the petitioners, Uday Chandra Jha, was represented by advocate Shradanand Jha.

10,4 injured in clash over flag hoisting,"MUZAFFARPUR: At least four persons were injured in a group clash over hoisting of the national flag at the Panchayat Bhavan in Chakkisohagpur village under the Paroo police station on the Republic Day on Sunday.

While one of the warring groups was led by mukhiya Sudesh Prasad Singh, the other by a panchayat ward member, who is the wife of Nageshwar Kunwar.

According to reports reaching here, the woman ward member of the panchayat unfurled the Tricolour at the Panchayat Bhavan as the mukhiya reportedly could not reach for the function on time.

When the mukhiya reached along with his three brothers later and saw the flag already unfurled, he allegedly started uprooting the bamboo on which the flag had been unfurled to hoist it afresh, the reports said.

Some of the villagers present there, however, objected to it and tried to prevent the mukhiya from uprooting the bamboo.

A verbal wrangle ensued which was followed by firing on the protesting mob. A villager, Ram Lagan Sahni, sustained pellet injuries. The furious mob then assaulted the mukhiya and his supporters.

The injured mukhiya and his two brothers were admitted to S K Medical College Hospital here.

Meanwhile, separate FIRs have been filed by both the parties with the Paroo police station of the Muzaffarpur district in this regard.

There was no report of any police action in this connection till the filing of this report on Monday evening.

11,Cong splinter group to back UP govt: Mayawati,"NEW DELHI: Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Mayawati on Tuesday asserted that the eight Opposition Congress MLAs, who have raised a banner of revolt, have expressed confidence in her leadership and claimed they have extended support to her government.

""Eight MLAs have left Congress and have formed a separate party. They have expressed confidence in my leadership and government,"" she told reporters here.

To a question whether the splinter group would extend outside support to her government or join her ministry, she said they have come out of Congress and let them take a decision.

Mayawati is in the capital to address a meeting of the Delhi unit of BSP to galvanize workers ahead of the assembly elections in Delhi next year.

She said party supremo Kanshi Ram, who accompanied her to Delhi from Lucknow, left for Himachal Pradesh where assembly elections are due next month.

12,Modi asks PM to include Gujarat under Gram Sadak Yojna,"AHMEDABAD: Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday urged Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee to include the state under the ambitious rural connectivity plan ''Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojna''.

Speaking on the occasion of the completion of the first phase of the Ahmedabad-Vadodara Expressway, which was thrown open to public by Vajpayee, Modi said, ""Though Gujarat has 98 per cent rural connectivity, we wish to upgrade the quality of roads and also broaden them.""

""Though the plan is for the benefit of underdeveloped states having poor road connectivity, the Centre should consider giving special incentives to states like Gujarat, which have proved to be frontrunners in the nation''s development,"" said Modi.

The Chief Minister thanked the PM for solving the long-pending crude oil royalty problem and for efforts to expedite increasing the height of the Sardar Sarovar Dam.

""Gujarat has always been a laboratory for experiments related to development. And this expressway also was one such successful experiment,"" he added.

14,"Rajnath denounces, Venkaiah soft on UP MLA's arrest","NEW DELHI: Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mayawati''s act of arresting independent MLA Raghuraj Pratap Singh under POTA has set the cat among the pigeons in the BJP. If one section has strongly denounced the arrest under POTA as an act of political vendetta, another is seeking to distance itself from any criticism of the arrest, lest it adversely affect the future of the BJP-BSP ties.

On Tuesday, BJP general secretary and former UP CM Rajnath Singh, who had already criticised the arrest, using even stronger language, saying the use of POTA in this case was pure ""political vindictiveness"". ""What sort of politics is this? The CM says that if anyone with criminal charges against them joins her party, the charges will be dropped. If they won''t, action will be taken against them.""

And when asked how he rated the future of the BJP-BSP alliance, he shrugged his shoulders and silently gestured above, meaning it was in the hands of the almighty.

Party president Venkaiah Naidu, on the other hand, sought to soften the criticism. ""We had said the use of POTA by the Tamil Nadu government against MDMK leader Vaiko was inappropriate. But in the case of Raja Bhaiyya, I have asked my general secretary, Arun Jaitley, to examine the FIR etc. After studying the case carefully, we''ll take a stand,"" he said, adding: ""In any case, it will not affect the BJP-BSP equation.""

Echoing this, another senior party functionary stressed that the BJP did not intend to go out of its way to defend Raja Bhaiyya. ""We won''t stick our necks out for Raja Bhaiyya, nor do we intend to go in appeal against the evidence of the police. If he has been wrongfully charged under POTA, the remedy lies in the courts, not in the political alliance.""

Tuesday''s events come in the wake of the protest lodged first by BJP''s UP chief, Vinay Katiyar, against the booking of Raja Bhaiyya, under POTA, on Sunday. On Monday, Rajnath Singh had criticised Mayawati, saying the arrest of Raja Bhaiyya ^ who was in his ministry when he was the UP CM ^ and his father, Uday Pratap Singh, under POTA was a ""political misuse of the act"". He also gave a certificate to the father-son duo, by adding: ""They are not anti-national. Why impose POTA?""

15,Private participation in govt medical colleges allowed,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Kerala''s UDF government has in principle decided to allow private participation to improve basic facilities in government medical colleges, Health Minister P Sankaran told the state Assembly on Tuesday.

The proposal was to allow private participation in infrastructure improvement including super specialty blocks and pay wards on Build Own Transfer (BOT) and Build Own Operate and Maintain (BOOM) basis, the Minister said in reply to questions.

The idea was thought of as the government was in want of funds to equip public healthcare to meet new challenges. ""Private participation does not mean privatisation,"" he said.

Sankaran said there had been a sharp decline in budgetary provision to healthcare in the last four decades, from 10.45 per cent in 1960-01 to 5.75 per cent in 2001-02.

Defending the decision to rope in retired professors to medical colleges, he said this was done to ensure that patients were not hit for want of doctors. About 30 per cent of doctors'' posts now remained vacant in medical colleges, he said.

The opening up of medical education to self-financing sector had helped save cash outflow to neighbouring state to the tune of Rs 99 crore a year, he added.

16,Pune business distressed at minister's port announcement,"PUNE: The city''s business community has been ""taken aback"" by Union civil aviation minister Shahnawaz Hussainâ€™s announcement here on Saturday, ruling out the much-dreamt-about international airport for the city.

The community is trying to figure out the reason behind the announcement, particularly at a time when the city is opening up as a sought-after destination for business. Incidentally, those earlier connected with the airport project â€”- former Union cabinet secretary B.G. Deshmukh, who had undertaken a feasibility report and submitted the same to the Maharashtra government, and city MP Pradeep Rawat â€”â€” now sound non-committal.

Hussain, who was in the city on Saturday, contradicted the earlier claims made by his ministerial colleague, Sripad Naik, that the government has in-principle approved the setting up of the international airport at Chakan near Pune. ""It won''t be a viable proposition, particularly when such an airport already exists in Mumbai and another one is being planned at Navi Mumbai,"" he had told newspersons.

The director and chief executive of the Software Technology Parks of India, Sushil Gupta, who has always been advocating the need for an international airport here, expressed surprise at the minister''s announcement, and said this would have a dampening effect on the industrial belt in Pune, particularly the growing IT and BT sectors. ""Even an announcement by the government that it will set up an airport would have had a tremendous impact on Pune''s business prospects,"" he told TNN, adding that the justification given by the minister doesn''t hold much grounds.

""In any case, it takes at least two-and-half hours for one to drive down from Navi Mumbai to Pune,"" he said, adding that the demand for an international airport in Pune, if not today, would reach its peak in a couple of years.

The director-general of the Mahratta Chamber of Commerce, Industries and Agriculture, D.K. Abhyankar, said, ""The minister''s announcement would only send wrong signals to industry, particularly when we have opened the Rs 300-crore international trade centre here last week. The idea to open this centre is to get more business houses to set up bases in Pune.""

""How can the minister claim there isn''t a demand for an international airport here?"" he said, pointing out to the two-fold increase in the volume of commuters over the last couple of years. ""We now have six lakh people flying to-and fro Pune every year,"" he said, adding that even Mumbai has outgrown its capacity, both in terms of passengers and cargo.

Deshmukh told TNN, ""It is up to the state government to decide. We''ve never demanded an international airport at Chakan,"" he said, adding that even in his feasibility report, he has talked about the possibility of creating a passenger air terminal with international cargo facility, which when required, could have been later developed into an international airport.

Rawat, also chairman of the local advisory committee, who on several earlier occasions had committed the international airport in Pune, said, ""What we are more interested is that Pune should be well connected with all areas of the country.""

Other members of the committee, however, blame politicians for their inconsistency in perusing the matter. ""It has been more than three years since the idea of setting up an international airport in Pune began, but till now, they are still undecided on the location,"" complained an aggrieved member.

17,Varde seeks new law to limit cabinet size,"MUMBAI: Chief minister Sushil Kumar Shindeâ€™s jumbo cabinet of 69 ministers has come in for sharp criticism from various quarters. Most people felt that size would not ensure efficiency and that Mr Shinde had no business to squander the state''s limited resources to please his coalition allies.

""The people are bound to ask whether we need so many ministers when the state was better administered by compact cabinets under the leadership of stalwarts like Vasantrao Naik or Y.B. Chavan,'''' former Union cabinet secretary and civic activist B.G. Deshmukh said.

""The state can ill afford to spend a crore annually on each minister when it is heavily in debt. But then, the CM may say that a large ministry will ensure political stability for the next 18 months,'''' Mr Deshmukh said.

In the present ministry, a fourth of the members of the 289-strong lower house hold ministerial positions. ""The CM will soon accommodate most of the remaining MLAs by appointing them as chairpersons of state government undertakings and authorities.

These chairpersons also enjoy ministerial rank. So in effect, almost all the legislators who are not in opposition will be driving around in cars with beacon lights and massive entourages,'''' noted former bureaucrat S.S. Tinaikar.

He noted that while there was no law specifying the size of a cabinet, the CM could have demonstrated that he is serious about discipline state finances by opting for a smaller team. Former Maharashtra minister Sadanand Varde felt that it was time for a constitutional amendment that specified the size of a cabinet.

He noted that the generally accepted norm was that the number of ministers should not exceed 10 per cent of the size of the House. ""But this new mentality of powerat -any-cost has subverted democracy. There is absolutely no accountability to the public,'''' he lamented. Estimates show that by the time the state goes to polls in September 2004 it will have spent Rs 100 crores on maintaining these 69 ministers.

Sociology professor at Mumbai University Sharit Bhowmik however felt that while the financial aspect was one matter, it was also likely that the state''s administration would suffer with too many cooks spoiling the broth. ""Ministries have been fragmented to please individuals. We have three ministers for education alone, one each for primary, higher and technical.

Now there is bound to be a repetition of work and increased bureaucracy,'''' he noted. ""It is tragic that we have to support so many ministers when colleges are reeling under staff shortage, because the state cannot afford fresh recruitment. Lecturers go without pay for three months at a stretch,'''' Mr Bhowmik added.

Trade activist Vivek Monteiro however felt that the matter was comparatively unimportant when there were larger issues at stake. ""Spending a hundred crore more on the ministers isn''t really of much consequence when the state is creating bigger financial blunders in the way it is privatising its assets.'''' He added that the number of ministers wasn''t an issue, their efficiency was.

18,State pollution board to warn hospitals flouting biowaste rules,"MUMBAI: The Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) will issue notices to hospitals and nursing homes that haven''t complied with the Bio-Medical Waste Management Rules, 1998.

The penalty could be imprisonment and a fine of Rs 1 lakh. The rules require, among other things, that biomedical or infectious waste be segregated from normal waste. Bio-medical waste is required to be sent to a BMC incinerator at Sewri, if the hospital does not have an inhouse facility.

""We have drawn up a list of defaulters as the deadline for complying with the guidelines expired on December 31, 2002,"" said Dr Amar Sopate, principal scientific officer of MPCB. The list is a long one, he said, as many big hospitals as well as small nursing homes haven''t been observing the rules.

According to BMC officials, barely 20 per cent of the bio-medical waste generated in the city reaches its incinerator at Sewri. ""We believe some nursing homes and hospitals may be dumping their waste in the regular garbage vats,"" said a BMC official.

The Union ministry of environment and forests had drawn up these rules after a sustained campaign by health care workers to highlight the danger to community health due to improper disposal of discarded blood bags, cotton swabs, body parts, used syringes and bandages contaminated with disease- causing microbes or viruses.

However, health care workers insist that it''s not just a matter of obeying the rules. Take the case of Dr Aniruddha Malpani, who has registered with the MPCB for Rs 7,500 as a generator of biomedical waste and has signed up with the BMC for another Rs 6,500 for collection and disposal of the waste.

""However, the BMC-appointed transporter told me that he would not be able collect the waste from my clinic at Colaba as there aren''t enough clinics in my area for him to visit every day,"" Dr Malpani told TNN. The administrator of a nursing home in Churchgate said waste was being picked up only once or twice in a week. The rules, however, stipulate that bio-medical waste should be disposed within 48 hours because of its toxicity.

Clearly, problems abound. Many doctors, for instance, aren''t aware that the MPCB has also issued a licence to a company called Pest Control of India-Cannon Hygiene to collect and dispose bio-medical waste. ""This was done to help nursing homes,"" said Dr Sopate.

According to PCI''s Dr Sandhya Maniker, ""Small nursing homes don''t generate enough waste every day. So we will provide them with special containers containing disinfecting fluids to store their waste for about a week."" The outfit will begin full operations in March. Even big hospitals have grouses. ""It''s important to segregate waste, but we find it expensive to shell out Rs 5 to Rs 14 for one bio-degradeable plastic bag,"" says a hospital administrator who doesn''t want to be identified.

Health care workers point out that there is little to substantiate the claim that these bags are bio-degradable. ""Even plastic manufacturers are skeptical about this claim,"" said Jagriti Bhatia of Hopes, an NGO that has been working along with the BMC in spreading awareness and educating health care providers on the issue. Hopes will hold its next workshop at St George Hospital next month.

There are also charges that waste is not being lifted every 48 hours from some hospitals. ""The transporter is facing some infrastructural problems,"" admitted additional municipal commissioner S.J. Kunte. The problem is being ""looked into,"" he added. The need of the hour is to rope in more transporters, say experts. ""There should be one transporter per ward,"" said Ms Bhatia.
