0,Police stop screening of films on Gujarat riots,"MUMBAI: Even as the Gujarat police recently allowed the Ahmedabad rath yatra to proceed, the Mumbai police has prevented secular groups from organising poster exhibitions and private screenings of films on the Gujarat violence, claiming that this could create communal tension.

On Saturday, the Kanjur Marg police entered DAV College and confiscated two films on the Gujarat carnage that were to be shown to students.

The films, â€˜In Dark Timesâ€™ and Junoon ke Badhte Kadamâ€™, were made by Delhi-based film-maker Gauhar Raza. Those who have seen the films say much of the footage has already appeared on Star TV.

â€œDeputy police commissioner Dhananjay Kamlakar told us that the films could create communal disharmony,â€™â€™ said activist Vinod Shetty.

He added that the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), the student wing of the BJP, had complained to the police about the films. Civil rights activists see this as yet another instance of the Mumbai police halting democratic protests against the Gujarat violence.

On July 12, the Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Marg police at Wadala had sought to scuttle a national convention on Gujarat organised by secular groups on the grounds that it â€œwould create communal tensionâ€™â€™.

The police had already forced the organisers to postpone the convention, retracting permission for it to be held in June at St Pius College, Goregaon (E). Said Subodh More of the Vidrohi Sanskritik Chalwal, â€œWe were told that Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi was not granted permission to address a public meeting at Borivli, so the same yardstick was being applied to us.â€™â€™ The police finally permitted the convention on July 13 on the condition that it would not allow a poster show on Gujarat to which the ABVP had objected.

â€œWhat the police are doing is equating organisations like the VHP and ABVP with anti-communal groups that are working for communal harmony,â€™â€™ said Jairus Banaji of Insaniyat. Added scriptwriter Anjum Rajabally, â€œEffectively, such actions muzzle the democratic right to raise questions and debate issues that are of concern to all citizens.â€™â€™

Joint commissioner (law and order) Javed Ahmed said the police was only going by the book. â€œI donâ€™t see why people should get upset if the police make a few inquiries in the line of duty,â€™â€™ he said. Questioned about the poster case, he said he would have to speak to his juniors about it.

1,Violence at army recruitment rally,"LUCKNOW: Violence broke out during an army recruitment rally at the army parade ground, when thousands of candidates went on a rampage, fighting a pitched battle with the police, pelting stones and damaging five buses and over 12 private four-wheelers, on Monday morning.

Over a dozen candidates and several commuters were also injured in the brick-batting and the police cane-charge which followed to disburse the angry mob of candidates.

The incident started at around 7.30 in the morning, an hour after the start of the rally for recruitment. Over 20,000 aspirants hailing from Varanasi, Amethi and Lucknow had assembled at the ground for the rally. With little police force to man the mob and no barricading at all to control the inflow of candidates, trouble started when a group of aspirants pushed others in front of them to get first chance for the mandatory run in the first qualifying round.

When aspirants continued to create ruckus, army authorities announced that no rally would take place unless order was maintained. Then a few police constables used mild force canes to put aspirants in order.

The result was a stampede and, as aspirants retreated, some among them started pelting stones. A contingent of PAC which was also deployed for the occasion arrived at the scene and started cane-charging trouble-makers. The candidates ran amok and, while shouting slogans, resorted to heavy brick-batting. As police chased them, candidates gave vent to their anger by breaking window panes of the cars and jeeps parked all along the parade ground till the KK College. They also damaged five buses, three of the UP State Road Transport Corporation and two private, on the way.

Army officers tried to contact senior police and district administration officials. While a posse of police from the local police station was rushed to the spot, for three hours there was confusion among the police and district administration officials as to who would attend to the crisis as most of them had taken charge of their assignments in the city only on Sunday and were not well-acquainted with the circumstances. However, the order was restored by 11 am and the rally started again.

3,Janardhan Reddy adopts wait-and-watch policy,"HYDERABAD: The warning from the Congress high command about a strict action against him notwithstanding, former Congress Legislature Party leader P Janardhan Reddy has decided to wait for the partyâ€™s decision before taking any further step.

Janardhan Reddy, who earned the wrath of AICC general secretary Vayalar Ravi in the light of the unruly scenes witnessed at the airport on the latterâ€™s arrival a couple of days ago, refused to comment on the issue when contacted by The Times of India.

He said that he would wait for the decision of the high command before making a comment on the issue. â€œI donâ€™t want to make some comments hurriedly on the issue. Let the high command give its decision,â€� he said.

4,BJP’s Delhi bandh flops,"NEW DELHI: The bandh called by Bharatiya Janata Partyâ€™s Delhi unit to protest the power and water situation made little difference to people as Monday is the weekly holiday for most major markets.

About 50 persons, including New Delhi Municipal Council vice-chairman Ram Bhaj, were detained by the police for forcing traders to down shutters. No violence was reported from any part of the city.

State BJP president Madan Lal Khurana had called the strike claiming the support of over 200 business and market associations. Although many traders agreed that the poor power and water situation was affecting business, they said the strike was untimely as most shops were closed anyway.

Major markets, including Karol Bagh, Laxmi Nagar, Lajpat Nagar, Kamla Nagar, Gandhi Nagar, Sarojini Nagar, Ashok Vihar, Dev Nagar, Vikas Marg market and Krishna Nagar are shut on Mondays.

Even those open, including Connaught Place and Darya Ganj, did normal business. However, Shanker Market remained closed.

The effect of the bandh was marked in BJP strongholds like Chandni Chowk, Lajpat Rai Market, Bhagirath Palace, Khari Baoli, Fatehpuri, Kashmiri Gate, Chawri Bazar, the Paharganj timber market and Kirti Nagar. In many places, it was more of a show of political strength. In CP, BJP supporters asked traders to down shutters in the morning. By afternoon, Congress leaders Subhash Chopra and Mukesh Sharma were seen persuading traders to open their shops, ensuring police protection.

For Khurana, who took over the city BJP chief recently, the bandh was a way of making his political presence felt. He lashed out at the government for what he termed an â€˜â€˜unprecedented power and water crisisâ€™â€™.

5,Congress rally disrupted traffic,"NEW DELHI: Monday morning saw massive traffic disruptions in several parts of central Delhi, as thousands of Youth Congress workers took to the streets to protest against the Centreâ€™s alleged anti-farmer policies.

The rally began from the Youth Congress office on Raisina Road and ended at Jantar Mantar after 1.30 pm.

â€˜â€˜Since work on Metro Rail is going on near Raisina Road, the roads are already constricted there. The rally further increased the problems for motorists,â€™â€™ said deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Arun Kampani.

However, the worst-hit were commuters who found themselves stranded in traffic jams. â€˜â€˜My office is in Connaught Place but I was caught in a jam for over 30 minutes near the Jantar Mantar crossing,â€™â€™ said Ritesh Kumar Singh, a Mayur Vihar-based marketing executive.

German interpreter Neetu Arora also had same grievance. â€˜â€˜My autorickshaw was stuck near Le Meridien hotel for almost an hour as buses carrying these protesters were parked on the road haphazardly,â€™â€™ she said.

People from Rajasthan were brought to the state guest house on Prithviraj Road. Rohini Saluja, from Safdarjung Enclave, found herself stranded at Prithviraj Road. â€˜â€˜People who alighted from these buses merrily settled themselves on the road. And they would not budge even after honking.â€™â€™

6,J&K govt plans to promote pilgrim tourism,"RINAGAR: The Jammu and Kashmir government has formulated a comprehensive plan to promote pilgrim tourism in a big way, as the state has a number of important religious places.

7,BJP leaders to meet EC today on Gujarat polls,"NEW DELHI: A three-member BJP delegation led by party president Venkaiah Naidu will meet the Election Commission here on Wednesday to press for early elections to the Gujarat Assembly. Naidu, alongwith party general secretaries Arun Jaitley and Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, are expected to apprise the panel of the peaceful atmosphere in the state, which is conducive for polls, party sources said. They are also expected to counter the Opposition demand for President''s rule and cite the ""massive rehabilitation operations"" carried out by the state government and the peaceful conduct of the recent Jagannath Yatra in Ahmedabad to assert that the elections could be held peacefully under the caretaker Modi government, the sources said. The inclusion of Naqvi, a senior party leader, in the delegation is considered significant in view of the charges that the party was ""anti-minorities."" Naqvi had recently stated that the elections in the state would not be on ""communal lines"" and that party''s Muslim leaders including Union Minister Shahnawaz Hussain would campaign there to expose the ""pseudo-secularism"" of the Congress. A high-level Congress delegation led by Manmohan Singh had on Monday met the Commission and demanded President''s rule in Gujarat. The Congress also dismissed as ""fallacious"" BJP''s argument for holding Assembly polls by October and maintained that elections were ""not a priority"" for the violence-hit state. Former Prime Minister I K Gujral and some noted citizens had also earlier met the panel and opposed early polls.

8,BJP allies oppose early Gujarat polls,"NEW DELHI: Lambasting the Narendra Modi government for having failed to protect communal harmony in Gujarat, BJP allies - TDP, Trinamool Congress and JD(U) - on Tuesday said elections in the state cannot be an ""overriding priority"" and the situation there was not conducive for polls.

""Gujarat situation is not conducive for elections now, though it is for the Election Commission (EC) to take a final view on it,"" senior Trinamul Congress member Krishna Bose said during a debate on relief and rehabilitation in strife-torn state in the Lok Sabha.

While TDP leader K Yerrannaidu emphasised that elections cannot be the ""overriding priority at this stage"", JD(U) member Devendra Prasad Yadav said the Election Commission should ""set some standards"" to decide on holding of polls.

Stating that the happenings in Gujarat had ""brought shame to India"", Bose said she had a ""sad experience"" of her visit to relief camps in the state. She said a feeling of ""alienation and suppressed anger"" prevailed among the victims and warned that ""alienation is the breeding ground for terrorism"".

Yadav said, ""Despite being in the NDA, I have to say that spread of communalism is not part of NDA agenda. The agenda is for secularism and no one has the right to tamper with it"".

He said the Modi government had failed to check or ban ""those organisations which were responsible for the carnage"" because ""reaction (to Godhra-type incident) can go on for some days or a few weeks, but not for months together"".

9,Oppn to grill govt over bank scam,"MUMBAI: The Shiv Sena-Bharatiya Janata Party alliance will launch a frontal assault on the Democratic Front government in the coming session of the state legislature for its failure to arrest Pavanraje Nimbalkar, chairman of the Osmanabad District Co-operative Bank, who is wanted in the Rs 200-crore scam.

Nimbalkar is a member of the ruling Nationalist Congress Party and is related to state energy minister Padamsinh Patil. The Sena has alleged that Nimbalkar is being shielded by the NCP.

Nimbalkar has been absconding ever since the bank scam was exposed. The bank allegedly gave lakhs of rupees to broking firm Home Trade company to buy government securities, which it never received.

The issue was raised at a recent meeting of the board of directors of the Maharashtra State Co-operative Bank (MSCB), the apex co-operative bank in the state.

The meeting was specially called by the MSCB chairman Suresh Deshmukh to inform directors about the government securities scam affecting banks the state.

Deshmukh, who hails from Wardha, was grilled by the members of the board for not giving satisfactory information about the bank scams.

Ironically, the Wardha District Co-operative Bank, of which Deshmukh is the chairman, is also involved in a scam. The state government has dissolved the board of directors, but Deshmukh continues to be its chairman.

Deshmukh had to face angry members who wanted to know exactly how many banks were involved in the scam involving Home Trade.

Irrigation minister Ajit Pawar,who member of the board of directors and nephew of NCP chief Sharad Pawar, was also present during the stormy meeting.

The members were assured by Deshmukh that they would be informed about the progress of investigations into bank scams involving Nagpur, Wardha and Osmanabad District Co-operative Banks. The Nagpur bank chairman and former minister Sunil Kedar has been arrested by the police.

10,Amnesty to come out with report on Gujarat riots,"AHMEDABAD: The Amnesty International has said that their team of researchers not being allowed to come to Gujarat will not hamper their efforts in keeping the communal violence in the state on the international agenda.

The rights watchdog is in the process of coming out with a special report on the violence in Gujarat and their delegates were expected to get first-hand information on the situation. Now that they have been denied access, they will take information from secondary sources and activists who have already been working in the state since the early days of the violence.

""Really, this is not an unusual situation for us,"" said Vijay Nagraj who co-ordinates Amnesty''s India operations. Speaking to TNN on the phone from New Delhi, he added. ""We know how to take information from countries which are not accessible.""

Amnesty was trying to bring in two researchers to get a picture of the ground realities in the state. They were Julia DePonte, an Italian national who is a researcher on India and Paminder Parbha, an Indian-born British national. Both work at the agency''s international secretariat at London.

However, what one can expect from the report is evident in Amnesty''s state on Monday after they were denied access. It expressed deep regret, but also made a direct attack on the government saying, ""Amnesty International believes that the refusal of the Indian government to grant access to the state will only reinforce the concerns that the government of Gujarat and the state police might have been accomplices in preparing the ground for the violence and in allowing it to occur, and could be attempting now to cover up involvement of their officials.""

It was not that the agency was directly turned down by the Indian embassy at London. According to the release, they were more diplomatic and added, ""The Indian government failed to provide a response to the visa application submitted by the organisation before the mutually agreed deadline of July 12. As agreed with government representatives in London, Amnesty International is therefore compelled to assume that the visa will not be granted.""

""This refusal damages the image of both the Indian and Gujarat governments before their citizens and the international community. A government which fully accepts its responsibilities in protecting its citizens and upholds their constitutional rights to life and equality does not shy away from international scrutiny"", the organisation said.

11,Shiv Sena woos ‘patriotic Muslims’,"MUMBAI: In a major makeover, the Shiv Sena plans to induct â€œpatrioticâ€™â€™ Muslims into the party. â€œLet us come together. We want the Muslims, who think India is their motherland, to be with us,â€™â€™ key Sena leader Uddhav Thackeray said at a meeting on Sunday.

Stressing the relevance of Hindu-Muslim unity, Uddhav said, â€œThe Pakistan bomb will not distinguish between communities. Muslims too will perish. So, the only way out for the Hindus and Muslims is to join hands to defeat Pakistanâ€™s designs against our countryâ€™â€™.

He was speaking at a meeting to flag off the partyâ€™s membership drive for north Indians. The function was held in a crisscross â€˜wadiâ€™ in Andheri with a cluster of Muslim bastis.

Dwelling on the Senaâ€™s definition of â€œpatrioticâ€™â€™ Muslims, Mr Thackeray cited cricketer Mohammad Kaif as a case in point.

â€œKaif did the country proud in the recent NatWest tri-nation match in England. He snatched victory from the jaws of defeat at the Lordâ€™s.Such Muslims are our brethren. Mohammad Kaif is a â€˜sachchaâ€™ Hindustani, a Hindu.â€™â€™

â€œBut those who, while earning their bread in India, dream of Pakistan or nurse a secret ambition that India should be fragmented have no right to stay on the soil of this country. We are opposed to such Muslims and the Sena is doing nothing wrong in taking them on,â€™â€™ Uddhav added.

He rubbished the claim often put forth by the Senaâ€™s detractors that the party believed in strong-arm tactics and muscle power. â€œWe safeguard the interests of the Hindu community. And we will continue to do it,â€™â€™ he declared.

Several prominent north Indians from the neighbourhood formally joined the Sena in the presence of Mr Thackeray, Union minister of state for finance Anant Geete and party MP Sanjay Nirupam.

12,Celforce offers free incoming calls in Gujarat,"AHMEDABAD: A day after Idea made an attractive offer to cellular users making all incoming calls free, Celforce on Tuesday announced that incoming calls would be free for their subscribers in Gujarat from any mobile phone across the world till August 15.

13,BJP expects Gujarat polls by Sept 20,"GANDHINAGAR: September 20 was the date most BJP MLAs were talking about in the state capital on Tuesday as the likely date for elections in Gujarat.

Tuesday being an ''MLAs day'', when all legislators are allowed to freely meet the chief minister, a large number of them flocked to the Sachivalay here to know the latest on the possible election dates.

A large number of MLAs in fact wanted to get clearance from the CM for works in their constituencies, now that elections are imminent.

BJP chief whip Mangaldas Patel, who is close to Modi, said, ""The CEC has no other go. It must ensure that the next Assembly session is convened six months after it met on April 3. Which means it should be convened by October 3. And for this, polls will have to held by September 20, not any later, so that counting is done, notification is out, and government formation begins.""

The same view was expressed by other MLAs. Said Mayaben Kodnani, ""The CEC must declared polls by September 20 to ensure that the constitutional requirement is fulfilled."" Mahendra Patel insisted, ""I do not think the CEC is so negative, as it is made out to be. It has said it was not going to rush to any conclusion. Which means it will hold the polls within the stipulated period of six months of the last assembly session."" Added a senior minister, ""The CM must have done his calculations well in advance.""

One Cabinet minister said, ""If we are unable to hold elections early, then the whole purpose of dissolving the Assembly early will be lost. We wish to cash in on the upsurge of Hindutva over the last several months. The earlier the polls, the better for us.""

14,ABVP activists protest varsity fee hike,"PUNE: The Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) on Tuesday burnt effigies of University of Pune vicechancellor (V-C) Ashok Kolaskar at the Marathwada Mitramandal College of Commerce and Sir Parashurambhau College in the city.

ABVP spokesperson Debdatta Joshi that the effigies were burnt as a mark of protest against the VC for saying that he does not have the powers to order a rollback of the recent fee hike.

ABVP leader Dhananjay Kulkarni, who is also a senate member, said that a detailed plan of action was being worked out to resist the fee hike.

â€œThere has been an annual surplus of approximately Rs 2 crore for the last three years. Besides this, the university has deposits worth Rs 80 crore, out of which it gets a whopping Rs 7.5 crore as interest every year,â€� Kulkarni said, casting doubts over the V-Câ€™s claim that the university had no option but to hike the fees to meet burgeoning costs.

On the other hand, the stalemate seems to continue in the university campus for the sixth day as students from most of the departments boycotted their classes in protest against the fee hike.

The students, as part of their lecture programme, attended a lecture by economist Sulabhe Brahme on â€˜Fee hike and the new economic policyâ€™.

15,Haryana govt to build airport for corporates near Delhi,"FARIDABAD: The Haryana government is keen to build an airport between Bawal and Dharuhera, not far from Indira Gandhi International airport. The proposed airport will be exclusively used by corporate executives.

Addressing various business houses on Tuesday, state Chief Minister Om Prakash Chautala said industrialists who came in their personal aircraft had to wait for clearance to land at the Delhi airport.

The airport, said Chautala, is part of the governmentâ€™s drive to develop a strong infrastructural base to attract foreign and domestic capital investment in Haryana. He also announced the construction of an overbridge on Mathura Road at Badarpur border to remove a major traffic bottleneck.

The chief minister said he was in constant touch with Union urban development minister Ananth Kumar and road transport minister B C Khanduri to expedite the clearance for the overbridge, which will bring immense relief to people of Faridabad.

In the power sector also the state has provided 65 mw additional power, either through its own plants or by purchasing it from surplus states.

Chautala said funds for such infrastructural development would come from additional land revenue which will be generated by upgrading irrigation facilities. The stateâ€™s share of Ravi-Beas water will be obtained after the completion of SYL canal, he said.

The proposal to build an amusement park with casinos on Jaipur Highway, Gurgaon, would be a money-spinner for the state, said Chautala.

He also met defence minister George Fernandes on Tuesday to seek his help in getting clearance for the park which is likely to come up on a 70 acre plot near some defence installations.

â€˜â€˜This amusement park will certainly come up,â€™â€™ he asserted.

16,Delhi govt to give Rs 400 to jobless rural youths,"NEW DELHI: The Delhi state government is planning to start a benefit scheme for unemployed youths in the cityâ€™s rural pockets.

Under the scheme, the government will give about Rs 400 per month to each unemployed youth residing in one of the 240 rural villages in Delhi. Five new degree colleges will come up in these areas.

At a meeting with the rural development department on Tuesday, state chief minister Sheila Dikshit said the government would constitute a rural development board along the lines of Trans-Yamuna Board. Funds would be allocated for the Board to develop rural areas.

The proposal to give doles to unemployed youths was mooted by legislators Mahinder Yadav and Zile Singh Chauhan who were present at the meeting. The MLAs said poor jobless youth who lived and studied in rural villages should be given a monthly allowance till they were able to find jobs.

Dikshit was informed that land had been acquired in Najafgarh and Jahangirpuri to set up colleges in rural areas. It was also decided to lay roads in the rural villages.

The members decided to set up dispensaries next to all higher secondary schools in rural villages. Dikshit said unused community centres and chaupals would be used to run professional courses in rural villages.

Development minister Haroon Yusuf and divisional commissioner G S Patnaik were present at the meeting.

17,BIS reject govt plea to set standards,"NEW DELHI: Mandatory ISI certification for electronic fare meters has been ruled out by the Bureau of Indian Standards.

In a reply to the Delhi state transport department it said electronic meters were being used in a few cities only, so nationwide standards could not be issued for them.

The reply has been sent by the Union consumer affairs ministry under whom the BIS functions.

The Delhi state transport authority (STA) had asked the ministry for mandatory Indian Standards Institution (ISI) certification for the electronic fare meters recently installed in autos and taxis in the city.

There are over 12,000 autos and taxis fitted with the new electronic meters, but most drivers donâ€™t ply by them, claiming that the meters do not work.

To end this epidemic of so-called malfunctioning meters, the transport authorities had wanted them standardised. â€˜â€˜We wanted the ISI mark to counter the claims of poor quality made by auto and taxi drivers,â€™â€™ a transport department official said.

A senior transport department official explained, â€˜â€˜Putting ISI marks would mean a thorough inspection of each meter to see that it met the set standards.â€™â€™

He did not accept the BIS rationale. â€˜â€˜If they set ISI norms for the whole country even before the meters are in use everywhere, they would be preempting a problem that might arise later.â€™â€™

Another official agreed. â€˜â€˜There is no point saying â€˜letâ€™s not have the norms since it is not prevalent in many placesâ€™. Our point is simple, if you have electronic meters, get a proper one (with ISI certification). If you donâ€™t, it doesnâ€™t matter to you.â€™â€™

The ministry, in its letter to the transport department, has also said that since none of the electronic meter manufacturers had applied for BIS certification yet, at least six months would be required to determpine the new standards.

At present, the manufacturers have to get the model of their meters approved by testing agencies authorised by the Union government.

On witnessing recurring instances of malfunctioning meters, they have also been asked by the state weights and measures department to get their meter samples re-tested at the Electronic Research Testing Laboratory in Okhla.
