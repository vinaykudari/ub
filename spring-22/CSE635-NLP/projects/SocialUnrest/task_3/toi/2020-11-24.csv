2,"Left-wing party biased, against Telangana: KCR","HYDERABAD: The Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) on Monday criticised the CPM for its â€œbiasâ€� towards the Telangana areas and Left-wing partyâ€™s stand on the issue.

Dubbing the state leaders of the CPM as pseudo-Marxists, TRS president K Chandrasekhar Rao said: â€œThe CPM is working against the Marxist principles by not taking up the issue which is based on social, economic and political significance. The CPM leaders are only supporting the injustices meted out to the region by the Andhra rulers.â€™â€™

The CPM has its base in the region, Rao told reporters. The two legislators of the Left-wing party, all of its 15 ZPTCs hail from Telangana and get the funds from the region, he said. â€œBut it is unfortunate that the party is neglecting the issue despite the regionâ€™s backwardness. This is because of the presence of leaders from coastal Andhra, including its state secretary B V Raghavulu, who are biased,â€™â€™ the TRS president said.

3,"Naidu cheated farmers, weavers: PCC chief","ANANTAPUR: The third day of the Congress partyâ€™s Prajahita bus yatra which began in Tadipatri continued to draw huge crowds in Anantapur district on Monday, with several Congress leaders venting their ire at the eight-year â€œmisrule and lopsided policiesâ€� of the Telugu Desam Party.

Addressing a press conference at Tadipatri before starting the yatra, Andhra Pradesh Congress Committee president D Srinivas said that his party would pay Rs 2 lakh ex gratia to the families of farmers and weavers who committed suicide.

The Congress president accused Chandrababu Naidu of cheating the farming community and alleged that the chief minister failed to bail out the farmers and weavers who were in misery.

â€œApart from free power, prohibition and a women-centric manifesto, the Congress would also give priority to problems at the local and district level,â€� he said.

â€œAs the APCC president, I am promising free power supply to the poor who have a single bulb and also to the agriculture sector,â€� he said and added â€œWe will fulfil our promise as soon as we come to power.â€�

He ridiculed the chief minister for laying three foundation stones for the Handri-Neeva Sujalasravanthi project, whose first phase is yet to be completed in Anantapur district.

Congress leader Y S Rajasekhara Reddy, who was present at the press conference, said that Anantapur district was in the grip of severe drought for the past three years and the Congress would announce a special drought-relief package if it is voted to power.

â€œThe long-pending Tungabhadra parallel canal will be completed and 10 tmc ft of water will also be allocated to the Penna Ahobilam Balancing Reservoir (PABR) to help the Anantapur farmers,â€� he said.

The bus yatra covered Tadipatri, Nayanapalli, Narpala, Bathalapalli, Dharmavaram, Penukonda and Hindupur mandals on the third day.

4,No equipment at toll gate to detect bombs,"HYDERABAD: An Explosive Vapour Detector (EVD), costing about Rs 8-10 lakh, has not been used at the Alipiri toll gate at Tirupati for the last two years, as the high pollution levels at the gate had rendered it useless. The security men manning the gate do not know how to handle this equipment and no effort was made to replace it.

This revelation was made by N Srinivasa Rao, an assistant vigilance & security officer of TTD and the in-charge of security at the gate, while deposing before the Prakash Singh commission of inquiry on Monday.

Rao said the security personnel at Alipiri gate check vehicles mainly for alcoholic beverages, contraband goods such as drugs and so on, but they had no equipment to find out the presence of explosives.

The AVSO said that the EVD was kept at the gate under the disposal of a TTD superintendent. It did not function right from day one. A letter was sent to the vigilance and security wing of the TTD asking them to take it back, but to no avail.

Greyhounds inspector-general Anurag Sharma said a contingent of greyhounds personnel were being attached to the chief ministerâ€™s security in districts too after the October 1 incident. Till then, greyhounds police accompanied CM only in the city following an order issued in 1992. To a question from Singh whether the GO prohibited Greyhounds police from travelling with the chief minister in the districts, Sharma said: â€œI will submit a report on this after going through the GO.â€�

Sunil Babu, Regional intelligence officer, Tirupati, told Singh he did not have any specific information pertaining to a Peopleâ€™s War threat. â€œThe planting of mines must have been a huge effort, and how come you did not get any wind of it?â€� Singh questioned.

As Sunil Babu replied it was done clandestinely, Singh retorted: â€œThat is what the intelligence is for. If it was done openly, the media would have reported it.â€�

Rayalaseema region Inspector-general of police (law & order) Sivanarayana, in reply to a question from the commission, said he was preparing a note on the security required at Prashanti Nilayam, Puttaparthi (Anantapur district), taking into account the October 1 experience.

5,Cheaper petrol for farmers,"BANGALORE: In a unique programme, farmers in remote villages will get petrol and diesel at discounted rates, much cheaper than any of the cities.

The state is putting together a project with Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) to set up petrol pumps in select Raitha Samparka Kendras (RSKs) in districts. â€œThe proposal is being finalised, but the concept is that petrol and diesel made in Karnataka should be sold here itself. We have suggested that the rates should be much cheaper and be provided to farmers at the RSKs,â€™â€™ development commissioner Vijay Gore said on Monday.

The finance department will also look into reducing taxes on petrol and diesel, which have made the Karnataka rates the highest in the country. â€œONGC and the state will try to push costs as low as possible,â€™â€™ he added.

Under a central scheme, two RSKs per district are already slated for upgradation. â€œFacilities like shops selling agriculture implements, spare parts, and ATM will be set up at these RSKs, depending on availability of space, for which NID has come up with a design. Petrol pumps are also proposed to be attached to these,â€™â€™ Gore outlined.

Rabi crop: Over 6 lakh hectares of rabi crop are under â€œmoisture stressâ€™â€™ due to failure of rains. â€œFailure of rains is the worst in 33 years. Due to the lack of moisture, expecting even 40 per cent of harvest from these 6 lakh hectares is optimistic,â€™â€™ Gore explained.

The state will prepare another memorandum seeking money and foodgrains to be sent to the Centre by the first week of December. â€œWe were very happy when the Hasta and Chitra rains came, but after that there has been no rain.â€™â€™

Insurance claims to the tune of Rs 112 crore have been paid to farmers, as against the estimate of Rs 330 crore for last yearâ€™s crop insurance. â€œFor this yearâ€™s kharif and rabi, we are settling all disputes between insurance companies, our records and farmers by ground-level checking of the standing crop,â€™â€™ Gore said.

7,N-E unrest hits Rly ticket sale,"DANAPUR: Following the incidents of violence and attack on the Bihari people in Assam, there has been a sudden fall in the sale of general tickets from Patna to Guwahati.

However, cancellation of the reserved railway tickets from Patna Junction to Guwahati is not too much, sources said.

At least six pairs of trains pass through the Patna Junction for Assam, particularly the mainline section of the Danapur division.

These trains are Guwahati-Bikaner Express(5631-5632), Guwahati Rajdhani Express(2423-2424), Dadar-Guwahati Express(5647-5648), North-East Express (5621-5622), Brahmaputra Mail (4013-4014) and Mahananda Express (4083-4084).

During the last one week, occupancy in these trains was poor especially from Patna to Guwahati. Surprisingly, the number of girls and women travelling from the north-east region has also come down after the Jamalpur incident in which a woman passenger was allegedly raped and several other women passengers were molested, sources said.

The sources further said that despite deployment of the armed force at all vulnerable station, women passengers of the north-east region do not prefer to travel by this mainline route.

According to sources, railways have stepped-up security in all Assam-bound trains from Patna Junction.

Each coach of the train is being thoroughly searched and the undesirable elements are not allowed to remain in the coaches. Coach attendants and TTEs have been instructed to keep an eye on the activities of any â€˜suspectâ€™ and inform the armed special squad party immediately in case of detection of any miscreant in the running train, sources said.

Railway sources said that a large number of Bihari people, who have been eking out their livelihood in Assam, are now returning to Bihar under tight security by different trains following repeated attacks on them in various parts of Assam.

Talking to TNN at Patna Junction Arvind Mistry and others said that Assam is no longer safe for Biharis.

â€œAlthough threat from ULFA has been there for a long time, the recent ethnic violence has made the situation worse for all Biharis,â€� he said.

Meanwhile, railways have suffered a huge loss during the recent ethnic clashes in Assam and Bihar following attacks on the railway properties and damage to air-conditioned coaches of different trains.

Burning of locomotives has also caused colossal losses to railways, sources said and added that railways have incurred an estimated loss of Rs 3 crore to Rs 4 crore so far.

8,Communal clash averted in city,"PATNA: The Langertoli area here on Monday night witnessed arson and violence as members of two communities fought a pitched battle for almost three hours.

At least five shops were ransacked and a house was looted before the police stepped in and used tear-gas shells to disperse the warring mobs. By midnight, RJD leaders Ram Kripal Yadav and Shayam Rajak also reached the spot to defuse the tension.

The trouble arose when members of two groups indulged in a verbal wrangle over some trivial issue. A member of a particular community, who was under the influence of alcohol, smashed the electric decorations put up for Eid celebrations. â€œHe was beaten up by members of the other community and this led to members his community ransacking some shops,â€� said SSP Sunil Kumar.

Kumar said the police had to resort to lathicharge and use tear-gas shells to bring the situation under control. Although no arrests had been made so far, the police would conduct raids to arrest the culprits. He said minor injuries were sustained by over a dozen people in the clash.

The road was littered with bricks and broken glasses as a car of the print media was attacked and the house of a TV cameraman looted. Members of both the communities complained about the late arrival of the police force. The members of a particular community complained against the fact that a large number of illegal liquor shops were allowed by the police to run in the area. â€œItâ€™s impossible for a girl to pass through this road without being teased in the evening,â€� stated RJD leader Khursheed Alam.

10,BJP MLA accused in riots blames Muslims,"AHMEDABAD: Deposing before the Nanavati-Shah riot probe commission on Tuesday, BJP legislator from Viramgam in Ahmedabad district, Vajubhai Dodia, said that police had falsely framed him in riot cases which were registered following violence in Mandal and Viramgam towns on February 28 last year.

Appearing before Justice (retd) G T Nanavati and Justice (retd) K G Shah, Dodia said that as the municipality chairman of Viramgam in 2002, he had been helping out in the rescue operations following violence at Mandal and later in Viramgam on February 28.

He said, â€œI even sought the help of the IOC to get fire brigade rushed to spots where there were incidents of fire, but despite that the police had booked me and other members of my family in various cases.â€�

Dodia told the commission that though he has been acquitted in the case at Mandal, the one at Viramgam is still pending. Dodia who was elected to the Assembly in December last year, also said the Muslims in the area have always been aggressive and have always tried to instigate the Hindus by hurting their sentiments.

He also said that even on February 28 it was a Muslim assault on the Hindus of Choksi Bazar, Kansara Bazar and Kapad Bazar in which more than 32 residential and commercial establishments were looted and set ablaze. In all, nine persons from Sanand, Viramgam, Detroj and Mandal towns of Ahmedabad district appeared before the commission to depose.

In his deposition, Ghanshyam Mohan Thakkar, an insurance agent from Viramgam, alleged that even the deputy mamlatdar of the area, Bashir Bapu, had fired on the Hindus using his personal fire-arm. Gautam Vyas, the ex-chairman of the municipality, said that the Muslim population in the area stands at 17,000 out of the total population of 65,000.

â€œThey are mostly illiterate and indulge in unlawful activities. Even on February 28 last year they had indulged in large-scale looting.â€�

Sayyad Merazuddin Shah of Sanand said in wake of the tension which was escalating since the morning of February 28, he had migrated along with his family to neighbouring village.

â€œThe Hindus from our village were very co-operative and they even sent us ration,â€� he said adding â€œwe came back on the third day and everyone in the neighbourhood made efforts to ensure that peace was maintained in the area.â€�

Hanif Mohammad Mir of Sanand also said â€œas tension mounted on February 28 we went to Hirpur but came back after three days.â€� He said police and the neighbours were helpful.

11,Farmers keen to make 'village bandh' a success,"AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat Khedut Sangharsh Samiti, which has been spearheading the farmers agitation for past few months, has given a call for â€˜village bandhâ€™ on December 1 to further exert pressure on the state government to stall the implementation of the revised power tariff for agriculture sector.

Samiti convenor Bipin Desai said at a news conference here on Tuesday that a decision on the bandh was taken unanimously at a meeting of farmersâ€™ representatives from various districts. â€œLocal committees of the farmers in talukas and districts have extended full support to the programme. Farmers will not allow milk or vegetables to reach market places.â€�

Desai said farmers have been asked to hold a peaceful programme in villages to create a desired effect on the Modi government which needs to understand the plight of farmers because of the hefty increase in power tariff.

Farmers he said protested the anti-farmer policies of the Modi regime. The bandh call would be supported by leaders including GPCC chief Shankersinh Vaghela, state NCP chief Chhabildas Mehta and Gandhians Indubhai Patel and Prasanvadan Mehta.

He said farmers would resist all attempts of the Gujarat Electricity Board officials to discontinue power supply to farmers and would oppose such a move through peaceful methods.

â€œWe will not tolerate disconnection of power particularly when farmers are busy cultivating the rabi crop.â€� Desai said farmers resented Chief Minister Narendra Modi backtracking from his promise that he would take care of people once they voted BJP to power.

12,Fruits of politics may stink,"JAIPUR: In the days gone by, princes and maharajas were weighed in gold and silver coins on their birthdays or weddings. These were then distributed among the poor.

Times have changed. The maharajas have been replaced by politicians. And instead of gold and silver, they are weighed in ladoos, fruits, bananas and vegetables, besides coins, by their supporters.

But here lies the problem. These are days of rotten politics and how can its fruits be different. There have been instances of people complaining that the fruits distributed to them were infested with worms. Not that the leaders are to blame. Unlike gold and silver coins, these commodities need to be consumed immediately.

But this hasnâ€™t really dampened the spirits. Take the instance of sitting Congress MLA Bhanwar Jitendra, a former prince of Alwar. Singh was recently greeted by traders with a garland made of vegetables. He was later weighed in fruits. These were distributed among people.

Pandit Behari Vyas, a local priest, said: â€˜â€˜Such practices were once a privilege of the rulers alone. But now politicians have become the new-age maharajas. I wish they were weighed in foodgrains and the same was distributed to the poor. Fruits and vegetables are not enough for the poor.â€™â€™

As the candidates vie for attention, the practice is picking up. Party workers prefer to weigh their leaders in bananas. The reason: Bananas come cheap. Congress workers made an exception for their leader from Hawa Mahal, R C Shah. They weighed him in apples because Shah lives close to the mandi. Brij Kishore Sharma, Congress candidate from Jaipur, was weighed against kheer.

13,Sons are no insurance policy for old age,"AHMEDABAD: There was a time when Rambhaben was envied by all in her family. For, she was the only one in their joint family in Palitana who had three sons.

Today, this 74-year-old rues how what she thought was a boon has become the biggest curse of her life. At present lodged in the Naranpura Home for the Old, Rambhaben shudders as she recalls the way her sons abused her before finally throwing her out of her own house.

â€œMy sons treated me worse than they would a dog,â€� Rambhaben said, as she tried to fight back the tears that rolled down her cheeks. In a state where girls are killed for the want of a male child, leading to a skewed sex ratio, old-age homes are full of parents who suffer silently the pain of being disowned by the very sons who they thought would be their support in old age.

The extent of the scourge can be gauged from the number of old age homes itself that has gone up from a handful to 22 in the city alone in the past two decades.

â€œPeople go to any lengths for a son. But in numerous cases, daughters have turned out to be more caring,â€� said Dinkar Rai Dave. This octogenarian, who moulded many a young mind as a school headmaster, is staying at the home for the past eight years along with wife Bhanu, after they was rendered homeless by their two sons.

â€œI failed as a father. How else would you explain the ruthlessness with which my sons took away my property, my money and forced me onto the streets. My wife suffered a heart attack and they even asked me to return the money they spent on her treatment,â€� said a tearful Dave.

Kantaben, now an inmate of the Shree MT Matrugruh in Paldi, was shattered when her son refused to support her. â€œHe has money to spend on his family and lead a lavish life but not for me,â€� she says. Superintendents of old age homes confess that it is mostly the inhuman treatment by sons that force old couples to seek shelter in the â€˜vrudhhashramsâ€™.

â€œInmates of our home have heart-rending stories to tell. It is our policy to have a meeting with the sons before admitting elders in our home, but they rarely turn up. If they do, they just refuse to shoulder the burden of caring for them,â€� said Veerbala Nagarwadia of the Naranpura Home for the Old. Nagarwadi conceded that the worst part was that none of the sons even bothered to visit them in the homes.

â€œOn the contrary, it is mostly daughters and neighbours who religiously come to visit the old and pay for their upkeep too.â€� he revealed.

â€œSons cite lame excuses like lack of space in the house and economic constraints for sending their parents to old-age homes. But the fact is that most just do not want to keep themâ€�, said Bhavna Chauhan of Shree MT Matrugruh.

14,Tribals will be left on their own after polls,"RAIPUR: Development and corruption have become two sides of the same coin in the propaganda war between the ruling Congress and the Opposition in Chhattisgarh.

In this chicken and egg debate, tribals, who comprise 35 per cent of the stateâ€™s population, are left out.

Of course, the Congress is playing the tribal card to the hilt by projecting CM Ajit Jogi as the only tribal leader in the state. But Jogiâ€™s assumption of power has not translated into empowerment of tribals.

RSSâ€™ Vanvasi Kalyan Ashram zonal secretary Nishikant Joshi blames it on the lack of urge for development among tribals. This, in turn, is the result of lack of education. He even terms the panchayati raj works and developmental activities as decentralisation of corruption that has no lasting impact on the villages.
