6,Students stageprotest against astrology courses in varsities,"pune: university grants commission chairman hari gautam, who on wednesday faced protests from a group of students here, said that 20 universities in the country had been permitted to introduce courses in vedic astrology. dr gautam addressed a press conference at the university of pune campus and said that while 50 universities had applied for the course, the ugc had granted permission to 20 of these. the course in jyotirvigyan would be offered at various levels such as b.a., b.a. (hons.), m.a. and ph.d, he said, while adding that even british universities were keen on introducing such courses. dr gautam was here to deliver the swatantryaveer sawarkar lecture on the challenges in higher education. protesting students raised slogans against the ugc over its decision on the vedic astrology course. about ten students also gheraoed dr hari gautam's car which resulted in mild caning by the university security. the students were later rounded up by the police. the ugc chairman justified the ugc's move to introduce the course in jyotirvigyan while stating that there was a need for qualified astrologers in the country as a majority of the population consulted astrologers ``at some point or the other in their lives.'' ``there are very few educated and qualified astrologers in the country,'' he said while adding that the availability of well-qualified and professional astrologers would help in meeting a genuine need of society. rejecting the criticism against the introduction of vedic astrology in universities, dr gautam said that the course in jyotirvigyan was ``knowledge based.'' he said that the common indian mentality was to reject and ridicule traditional knowledge systems. the same knowledge, however, was accepted with much fanfare once it was approved by western society, he said. dr gautam said that traditional indian systems such as yoga, and the concepts of ``chetana'' (consciousness) and ``atma'' (soul) were today accepted and hailed by western science. the tendency of indians to accept their own knowledge systems after it was approved by the west was wrong, he said.

20,Bajrang men arrested for disrupting HDMC meet,"hubli: the first general body meeting of the hdmc council on thursday did not go along expected lines, rather, the house witnessed acrimonious scenes. janata party members disrupted proceedings demanding the ""taking back"" of the smt basavamma jigalur kalyan mantap which has been handed over to a madarassa, while bajrang dal activists staged a noisy dharna on the same issue outside. as tempers ran high inside the house, bajrang activists who were seen egging on bjp members, tried to barge into the building. the police immediately swung into action and arrested them. a huge posse of policemen led by deputy commissioners of police t.r. suresh and manjunath annigeri were posted at the hdmc following the gherao announced by the bajrang dal. earlier, as soon as the meeting began, bajrang activists assembled before the hdmc shouting slogans against the mayor and the decision to hand over the kalyan mantap to the madarassa. mayor firdous konnur came down and received the memorandum. he told the activists that the council will not be able to take any decision now as the issue is before the court. to this, the bajrang dal activists urged the bjp members not to allow any proceedings until the transfer of the building is withdrawn. when mayor firdous konnur, after allowing members to discuss issue, gave a ruling that the case is sub judice as it is before the court and could be taken up at the next meet, the bjp members sat in the well of the house. the meeting was adjourned four times and even after five hours, there was no breakthrough. this forced the mayor to suspend the bjp members and call in the marshals to do their duty. bjp corporators ranga baddi and a few others were physically lifted by the marshals and the others walked out. as soon as the council assembled, opposition leader ashok jadhav and ranga baddi raised the issue of the kalyan mantap and sought a discussion on the transfer of the property to the educational institution. the mayor told the members that the proceedings of the house cannot be conducted as demanded by the bjp. this led to heated exchanges with bjp members rushing to the well, reminding the mayor that ""he is a new to the council meeting and should learn respect the members"". when the bjp was unrelenting, the mayor allowed a discussion. jadhav's argument was that the decision to hand over the kalyan mantap property was unilateral and done under political pressure. the hdmc commissioner told the member that after the protest of the bajrang dal recently, the hdmc has written two letters to the government. meanwhile, the previous party to who the building was entrusted has already approached court. the hdmc property under controversy in toravi hakkala was converted into a kalyan mantap on a yearly lease basis since 1995 with an annual rent of rs 28,000 to be paid to the civic body. when the contract ended, the party once again approached the hdmc to make it a three-year contract with an annual rent of rs 18,000, as the leasee had to invest on infrastructure. this was agreed to in 1996 by the council, but it was found that the party had to pay rs 70,000 as dues. it was revealed in the house that the earlier council meets had resolved to rent out the property to some others who could afford to pay the required rent. also, it was revealed that at one of the council meetings of the last council, all members including the bjp had unanimously agreed to hand over the building to a madarassa. however, ashok jadhav did not agree with this and argued that ""the members were misguided by the vested parties when it was tabled before the house."" he also charged that the resolution was passed without the expectance of the finance standing committee. as soon as the house reassembled after lunch, congress floor leader anil kumar patil reminded that the council does not have the local standing to decide as the case is still pending. jadhav shot back stating there is enough provision to discuss the case as it is still at the initial stage in court. he also said that all disputes need not be settled in court alone and it can be rectified without going in for legal recourse. at this point former mayor, pandurang patil agreed that the court is not the only solution to the dispute. this argument can be considered if the party withdraws the case and approaches for a settlement.

23,"SP activists court arrest, bandh a damp squib","kanpur: hundreds of samajwadi party activists courted arrest to protest against the cold-blooded killing of bandit queen turned samajwadi mp phoolan devi. the decision for a state bandh by the samajwadi party activists met with little success in the main parts of the city while other parts remained cool as usual. however, sporadic incidents of clashes between samajwadi party activists and the police were noted. following a call for a state-wide bandh by the state and central leadership, activists of the samajwadi party thronged the party office in the city at navin market to court arrest. district president of the party anil shukla warsi maintained that various block-level groups of samajwadi party activists visited different markets to make the bandh call a success. a heavy contingent of police force and pac had been deployed in the main markets of the city to avert any untoward incident by the sp activists. in navin market area itself, a heavy police force was deployed to tackle any untoward incident. the police arrested more than a 100 party activists from different areas. the police force also lodged cases against some sp activists, including one knn corporator durgesh yadav. the situation spun out of control when some members of the samajwadi party beat up a up roadways bus driver avdesh, who was deployed to transport sp activists to different areas. the police personnel used mild force against the restive activists. however, initial police complacence seemingly encouraged the sp activists to foment trouble and violence. at first, police personnel showed a certain bonhomie with members of the samajwadi party. infact, the friendly attitude seemed to be stretched to the limits as an increasingly emboldened sp member even managed to thrash a police personnel, saying that the party was likely to form the next government. he, infact, demanded that the police avoid any forceful action against the party workers. party mla from arya nagar area hazi mustak solanki, former mla shiv kumar beria, state vice-president of the chatra sabha chandresh singh courted arrest with a number of party activists. the other areas of the city, except gumti and some part of kidwai nagar, remained cool as usual. in gumti and kidwai nagar about a 100 samajwadi party activists tried to close shops but timely action by the police averted the situation.
