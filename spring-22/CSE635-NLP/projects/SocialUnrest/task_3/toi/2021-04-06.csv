0,SHO roughed up by lawyers in Tis Hazari,"NEW DELHI: In a shocking incident, the station house officer (SHO) of the New Ashok Nagar police station was beaten up by lawyers in the Tis Hazari court complex on Monday.

The SHO, Ashok Tyagi, is currently undergoing treatment in the Hindu Rao Hospital.

The incident occurred after 12.30 pm. Tyagi had gone to the court complex to appear as a witness in a murder case, in the court of additional sessions judge Khanna, when he was reportedly attacked by over 20 persons including many lawyers.

They were accompanied by a woman, Usha, who works as a lawyer''s munshi. A case, however, has been registered only against three lawyers and Usha.

""As the SHO entered from gate 1, he was approached by Usha and the lawyers and then roughed up and beaten by them,"" said DCP (north) Sanjay Baniwal.

Usha is a resident of New Ashok Nagar and is involved in a property dispute there which is pending with the SDM.

""Tyagi was saved by another sub-inspector and assistant sub-inspector who saw the crowd beating him and was taken to hospital,"" said an officer.

A case of rioting, threatening, causing grievous hurt to a public servant and obstructing a public servant on duty has been registered against three lawyers â€” Ravi Chaturvedi, Bhim Singh Nagar and Ghoklesh Yadav â€” and Usha.

Meanwhile, Usha, too, submitted a complaint alleging misbehaviour and usage of inappropriate language against Tyagi, said the police.

1,LeT terrorist arrested in south Delhi,"NEW DELHI: A Pakistan-trained terrorist owing allegiance to Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) was arrested by the special cell of Delhi Police on Sunday.

The accused, Irshad Malik (28), was allegedly trying to set up base in Delhi to provide safe hideouts to LeT terrorists, the police claimed.

""He was also collecting money through Hawala transactions for funding terrorism. A Chinese pistol, eight live cartridges and Rs 2.75 lakh cash has been seized from Malik,"" said deputy commissioner of police (special cell) Ashok Chand.

The accused was arrested from Bhogal in south Delhi. The police also seized two fake identity cards from Malik, who belongs to Doda.

The accused reportedly told the police that he was responsible for the bomb blast in Doda in 1998 which left many people injured.

""He was booked for two years under Public Safety Act, J&K, in 1998. He escaped from police custody in 1999 and came in contact with LeT commanders who sent him to Pakistan for training,"" added Chand.

Malik was trained in use of assault rifles, guerrilla warfare and improvised explosive devices at Aska camp in Muzzaffarabad. In July, 2003, he crossed over into India armed with an AK-47 rifle.

The police recovered an AK-56 rifle, two magazines and 60 rounds of ammunition from near Humayun Tomb. Malik had hidden the gun and ammunition there in January this year.

According to the police, Malik first set up base in Srinagar and started visiting Delhi on a regular basis. In Delhi, he contacted an acquaintance in Walled City who helped him find a place in Bhogal.

""During his stay in Delhi, he received more than Rs 10 lakh through hawala. He purchased a truck which he wanted to use for transporting arms and ammunitions,"" said Chand.

2,The trusts behind the political ads,"NEW DELHI: They are down but definitely not out. The Supreme Court may have tried to clip their wings by banning ''offensive'' political advertisements on television, but the trusts which triggered it all remain hopeful of finding ways to continue the campaign-by-proxy game.

Although its unclear whether future ads placed by trusts will have to be vetted by EC, as it is the case with political parties, they see ample room to push advertisements which attack the opponent without getting personal.

""What we understand from the SC order is that ads attacking individuals can''t go on TV. We can continue with ads that talk about our opponent''s non-performance or their flawed ideology. We will make new creatives based on these,"" says Kunal Lalani of Crayons Advertising, handling Kamakshi Educational Trust''s account.

The Kamakshi Trust is an alleged front for BJP, acting on cues provided by team Mahajan.

The Saajhi Virasat Trust, Kamakshi''s rival in the game is not disagreeing. It wants to continue with non-offensive ads if courts permit.

""We have sought legal advice on this issue. If the court allows, we will highlight communal outlook of the BJP and their failure to provide good governance,"" says Ali Javed of SVT.

The SVT, whose trustees include journalists Prabhash Joshi and Kuldip Nayyar, and Gandhian Nirmala Deshpande, denies allegations that they are a front for the Congress.

Says Joshi: ""Today, when we prepare ads against Atal Bihari Vajpayee or the BJP-led government, it is civil society standing up against their lies and dishonesty."" SVT says it is not putting up the ads vicariously.

""Our ads are not surrogate. We are saying what we feel. If the Congress comes to our support, we won''t shun them,"" says Javed.

The campaigners feel the definition of ''offensive ads'' is subjective and what they may present as a ''harmless'' ad could be construed slanderous by the EC.

""Our ad (alleging Vajpayee was an informer of the British in 1942) is based on documented evidence. It may be offensive to BJP, but it speaks the truth. Banning such ads curbs the freedom of expression,"" says Javed.

Lalani says, ""Instead of going into petty allegations, we just pointed out a fact: Sonia Gandhi is not Indian. But we realised Congress could stoop low so we approached the court. We didn''t want this ad campaign to get murkier, so we sought a ban.""

3,Should EC spend time monitoring political ad?,"NEW DELHI: Why did the Election Commission (EC), ready till Sunday with a methodology to check political ads, seek more time to file its affidavit in the Supreme Court? Was there any last minute rethink on its ability to do the gigantic task alone?

""We want to know what political parties feel about EC monitoring the ads,"" a senior commission official said.

But this seems to be only the tip of the iceberg. Actually, EC wants the apex court to ban slanderous political ads for all time to come.

A bit of EC''s mind was evident in the court itself when its counsel KK Venugopal gave the instance of how Germany, Norway and Switzerland have banned political ads.

He also said prohibitive cost of advertising on TV channels would mean bigger parties would have an edge over smaller ones.

Moreover, EC is also aware of how difficult the task of monitoring would be. EC expects that if the apex court approves the methodology it would also finetune the mechanism.

Political parties like the BJP has already raised reservations against EC''s idea of submitting ads 10 days before telecast. The party wants ads to be approved the same day.

As electioneering picks up pace, the last thing an overburdened EC can handle is monitoring political ads. The added responsibility would mean that the poll panel would have to keep an eye as to what is being done by 83 private channels, 33,000 cable operators, six national parties, 45 regional parties and 702 registered political parties. A Herculean, perhaps impossible, task.

Apart from monitoring these obvious sources of political ads, the EC would also have to prey on CDs and video cassettes made at constituency level by individual candidates against their political opponents.

Even EC officials admit that monitoring would mean that its real task of conducting free and fair poll would suffer.

As the election dates near, the Commission would be flooded with complaints of violation of model code of conduct. When the campaign gets over, complaints about violations of the mandatory stop of campaigning 48 hours before polling would pour in.

After the first phase, EC would be ordering repolls in various constituencies. On April 20, areas of naxal influence in Bihar, Jharkhand and Andhra Pradesh would go to polls. From past experience EC fears that at least in Bihar there would be some repolls.

""And you expect us to monitor political ads?"" one EC official asks rhetorically.

4,Congress expels 13 leaders for anti-party move,"PATNA: The state Congress has expelled 13 party leaders for six years for contesting the parliamentary elections on the tickets of other parties.

Those expelled leaders of the Congress also include senior leaders of the party. The party''s state spokesman, H K Verma, on Monday released the order issued by state president Ram Jatan Sinha in this regard. Among the leaders expelled are Shivnandan Singh (MLC), Rajendra Singh Bismil, Bharat Prasad Singh, Uday Singh ''Pappu'', Ranjit Singh, Abdul Jalil Mastan, Mobarak Hussain, Rajani Ranjan Sahu, Mahachandra Prasad Singh, Om Prakash Yadav, Paras Nath Pathak, Raj Kumar Rajan and Ajit Kumar Singh. Sinha, while claiming that the RJD had fielded a weak candidate, Bhagwan Lal Sahni, in Muzaffarpur parliamentary constituency to ensure the victory of Janata Dal (U) candidate and defence minister George Fernandes, said that Sahni had been an active member of the Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS) and was also president of the Muzaffarpur unit of Bajrang Dal. Sahni had also accompanied BJP leader L K Advani during his last ""rath yatra"", Sinha added.

According to Sinha, Sahni had participated in the demolition of Babri Masjid at Ayodhya and had his leg fractured in the stampede that followed. He said that to field such a person to contest the parliamentary election on the RJD ticket is ""unfortunate"". It has also been strongly protested by the party''s Muzaffarpur unit.

As a matter of fact, dissatisfaction prevails in the secular alliance circles, more so due to the fact that the Rashtriya Janata Dal had done it to ensure the victory of George Fernandes who had been boycotted in Parliament, including by the RJD, for three years, Sinha said.

Meanwhile, president of the Bihar unit of the National Minority Forum (NMF) and former minister Shaqiluzaman has criticised the Muslim community leaders and those associated with religious bodies of the community for supporting the BJP.

At a meeting of the NMF held on Monday, he criticised such leaders as Jameel Iliyasi and Ahmad Bukhari for supporting the Bharatiya Janata Party, since the latter has been implementing the RSS agenda.

He also recalled events such as demolition of Babri Masjid, and said that the BJP has persistently indulged in doublespeak.

6,India angered by Nepal violence,"NEW DELHI: The government of India has reacted strongly to Sunday''s attack on Indian cargo vehicles and Indian nationals by Maoists in western Nepal and called for the perpetrators of this ""blatant act of terrorism"" to be apprehended and punished.

In an official statement, the external affairs ministry spokesperson said Monday that India holds the leadership of the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoists) responsible for these incidents in which a number of Indian nationals were shot and seriously wounded and several oil tankers were burnt and destroyed.

At the same time, New Delhi has used the opportunity presented by Sunday''s incidents to highlight the importance of King Gyanendra and his political opposition reaching a ""national consensus to deal with this situation with the urgency it deserves"".

Kathmandu has been rocked by protests over the past week with thousands of demonstrators demanding an end to the ongoing constitutional crisis in the country.

The Indian government has also requested the Nepalese government to provide full security for the Indian personnel and property in Nepal.

India is ""already working together with the authorities in Nepal to confront the challenge of terrorism through mutual cooperation"", the statement noted.

""Such incidents, far from deterring such cooperation, will only lead to redoubled efforts on the part of both countries to overcome the danger which such terrorism poses to the security of both our countries.""

7,UP Assembly polls will follow LS polls: Kalyan,"LUCKNOW: Former chief minister Kalyan Singh on Monday said that assembly elections would also be held in UP soon after the Lok Sabha polls.

This was stated by Singh here in presence of Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee and Deputy Prime Minister, LK Advani, who were here to address an election meeting on the arrival of Bharat Udai Yatra of the latter.

While emphasising that the forthcoming Lok Sabha election was going to lay the foundation for a new prosperous India under the leadership of Vajpayee, Singh said the situation was also ripening for assembly elections in UP.

The now-turned bitter critic of the Samajwadi Party, the government of which was supported by him until before he joined the BJP recently, Singh said the situation was deteriorating so fast in the state that today the goonda raj had become a fact of life.

While the state''s interests had been auctioned by the ruling Samajwadi Party, he said the only industry flourishing in the state was kidnapping for ransom.

And he said all this was done with tacit support of the Samajwadi Party, which he described as a bunch of hoodlums and goondas.

He appealed to the people to vote the BJP to power and assured that once it gained power in the Centre, it would hold assembly poll in the state in just three months to liberate people from the misrule of the Samajwadi Party.

Singh, who is currently saddled with the responsibility of the BJP election campaign in the state, said that the BJP would secure anything between 40 and 45 out of total 80 Lok Sabha seats in UP. He had earlier put his estimate at 50-plus seats in the state.

8,Choice is between instability and development,"LUCKNOW: While lashing out at the Congress-led coalitions, Prime Minister AB Vajpayee on Monday said that the forthcoming Lok Sabha poll was important as people will have to chose between political instability and development.

""Political instability is the biggest impediment in the development of the country,"" exhorted the PM while addressing an election meeting held to receive the Bharat Uday Yatra of his deputy LK Advani in the state capital.

Congress he said had vested interests which was hindering progress. ""Today we are on the road to progress,"" he said adding; ""this was evident by the impressive 10.4 per cent growth in GDP. The economy, too, is strong enough to meet any challenge with inflation under check"".

This was the result of the efforts by my government over the last five years. ""So the question that hangs thick was not of caste, creed and religion, but of the country''s progress and happiness. And it was for the people to chose between the BJP and Congress, which had done nothing all through its 45 years of rule in the country,"" he said.

Earlier, Vajpayee showered praises on Advani while welcoming his yatra at Ambedkar Maidan. He said: ""We have a 50-year association and when the bond gets stronger, rivals start looking at it differently.""

He said he would not have become PM without Advani''s support.

In his speech, Advani said seven prime ministers have come and gone between 1988 and 1998 and this only spoke about political instability in the country.

He said the twin objective of his yatra was to highlight government''s achievement and ensure contact with people.

9,Offshoring heat to be on after US polls,"NEW DELHI: Admitting that the outcry against outsourcing jobs is not expected to die down even after US presidential elections, corporate leaders have suggested that US and India should sit together and thrash out issues of free trade.

""The issue is not about economics but about politics,"" Carla Hills, chairman and CEO of US-based Hills and Co, said at a â€˜Debate on Outsourcing'' organised by CII.

She said the outcry over job loss needs to be taken much more seriously this time as US is going through a jobless growth.

This was not the case earlier when there was a hue and cry over outsourcing of manufacturing jobs to China in the 1990s as the job market also expanded on the whole.

That Indian IT industry has reason to be worried was proved right as she said there could be tax laws in US to discourage firms from outsourcing. She also blamed India for not opening its market fast enough. ""India has one of the highest tariff barriers.""

Frank Wisner, former US ambassador, provided some hope when he said: ""It''s the political season. There are going to be voices. I would advise India to just stay out of the debate.""

Tommy Koh, ambassador-at-large, ministry of foreign affairs, Singapore, said outsourcing was done not only to reduce costs. ""It is for increasing productivity and also to access expertise that a firm doesn''t have.""

TCS executive V-P Phiroz Vandrevala said US firms stopped manufacturing TVs when they realised they couldn''t compete with the Japanese.

However, it is the US firms that supply most of the entertainment content to the world market. Also, in the US perspective, as Vandrevala pointed out, ""the demographics were changing as the population was ageing. So there was a need to outsource what you can.""

10,Gujarat demands more forces for LS polls,"AHMEDABAD: Lok Sabha elections 2004 might see a huge number of booths marked as ''sensitive'' compared to the elections of 1999, on account of the post-Godhra riots.

Election commissioner N Gopalswamy, who was in Ahmedabad on Monday to take stock of poll arrangements, was requested to allot additional forces for the state.

The Gujarat police put forth a demand of at least 125 companies of security personnel for deployment during polls, against which the Election Commission agreed to provide only 74 companies.

Gopalswamy held a meeting in the city with DGP A K Bhargav, district collectors, SPs, city police commissioners.

Bhargav said that according to a survey conducted two months ago, the number of sensitive booths was pegged at 8,000, ""but this figure will keep changing"". He added that Gopalswamy ""had promised to give us more companies for the elections"".

Later, at a press conference, Gopalswamy said that special arrangements, made by the commission during assembly polls in 2002 for voters from the minority community in riot-affected areas in Gujarat, would continue during Lok Sabha elections.

After hearing representations from political parties on poll arrangements, Gopalswamy said that the commission would set up 31 polling booths in sensitive areas at some of the riot-affected places in the state.

11,Cops grill principal over paper leak,"MUMBAI: Besides the TYBCom papers leaked on March 17 and March 31, four other papersâ€” economics, taxation, accountancy paper V and management of human resourcesâ€”were also leaked last month, said police commissioner A N Roy on Monday.

""The university authorises only the principal to conduct examinations. It is surprising how principal S B Sutar of NSS college, Tardeo, appointed his college lecturer Prakash Nagaria to be in charge of the examinations,"" said additional commissioner S M Sayyed. Sutar has been detained for questioning.

Sayyed added that Nagaria was given the ''authority'' by his principal to accept the sealed question papers, which were delivered by a private courier agency two days in advance.

""As per the university ordinance, the papers have to be delivered 15 minutes prior to the examination. This rule was flouted by the courier agency, whose officials will be questioned,"" Sayyed stated.

After accepting the envelopes containing the question papers, Nagaria allegedly broke the seal of one.

""He took an original paper to a xerox shop at Tardeo AC market and got a photocopy,"" Sayyed said. The original paper was put back in the envelope, which was then sealed with ordinary glue.

Sayyed said the principal ought to have have realised that the seal had been tampered with when he opened the envelopes on the day of the examination.

As per university procedures, envelopes have to be opened by the principal in the presence of four professors or lecturers.

The police are interrogating Sutar in order to find out whether there are ""bigger players"" in the racket.

The investigators suspect the role of a few university officials and several personnel from the courier agency and the printing press. The xerox operator is also detained by the police.

According to deputy commissioner Bipin Kumar Singh, Nagaria passed on the photocopy of the original question paper to his nephew, Achal Gupta, a second-year student of Mithibhai College.

Achal then made several photocopies and sold them to candidates for anywhere between Rs 3,000 and Rs 5,000.

The accused have confessed to having sold papers to 17 students last month, Singh said. ""We are trying to identify the students, against whom cases will be filed for conniving in the racket,"" he added.

Most of the students are suspected to be from Mithibhai College, whose principal, Madhav Welling, is a complainant in the case.

Welling had lodged a complaint on March 17 after he received a two-page fax of the question paper of financial accounting and auditing paper III on March 17. A second complaint has been filed by the university at the N M Joshi Marg police station.

Roy said the police planned to scrutinise the entire examination process of the university. ""The leakages are a matter of concern for everyone, and there is lot of unrest among students. My officers will take up the issue with the university officials and try to identify the flaws which have resulted in the paper leakage,"" he added.

The police will also study the security systems and supervision patterns being followed by the university.

12,Salman opposes state govt appeal,"MUMBAI: Bollywood actor Salman Khan on Monday opposed the appeal filed by the Maharashtra government against a lower court order allowing Bandra magistrate to conduct his trial in the hit-and-run case.

Salman''s lawyer Dipesh Mehta pleaded that the state''s appeal was ""abuse"" of law and an attempt to delay the trial.

The appeal came up for hearing before principal judge R R Vachha, who took Salman''s reply on record and deferred the matter to May 20 for arguments.

The actor has been on trial for killing one person and injuring four others by ramming his car into a shop in suburban Bandra on September 28, 2002.

The supreme court had, on December 18, asked the court in Bandra to go ahead with the case and decide during the course of trial whether the charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder was applicable to the actor or not.

The prosecution, however, raised objection in the trial court saying the same magistrate had earlier recorded statements of three witnesses.

Section 164 (6) of the crpc provides that such a magistrate should refer the statements to another magistrate who is conducting the trial.

The supreme court gave a major reprieve to Salman by directing the Bandra magistrate to try him for charges excluding ""culpable homicide not amounting to murder"" in a hit-and-run case which attracts ten years in jail.

The apex court held that the sessions court order framing this charge and high court order quashing it were not tenable in law as this question could be decided at the stage of the trial and not before.
