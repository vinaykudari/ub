0,CM has turned govt into family business: Gowda,"BANGALORE: Former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda on Saturday charged chief minister S.M. Krishna with turning his government into a ""family concern, indulging in real estate business.""

Without going into details, Gowda said he could prove the allegations. He took exception to Krishna posing with Congress members elected to Krishnarajapuram municipality.

""It is not an oath-taking ceremony. A minister who was in charge of the municipality, had said the Congress victory is an indication of the trend in the Lok Sabha polls. He must be day-dreaming,"" Gowda contended.

Krishnarajapuram municipality has been indicted by the Lok Ayukta for corruption. ""As such, what happens to institutions like Lok Ayukta,"" the former PM asked.

Gowda was speaking at a function attended by JD (S) workers from all districts. It was organised for the formal joining of JD(U) leaders P.G.R. Sindhia and N. Thippanna to JD(S), besides former ministers H.T. Krishnappa, B.B. Ningaiah and P.S. Jaywanth.

1,Dalits' rally pedals off to Delhi,"MANSA: Strained relations between Dalits and upper castes in Dalel Singh Wala village of Mansa district spells trouble for the district administration over the issue of bonded labour.

A cycle rally started by Dalit Dasta Virodhi Andolan (DDVA), a political outfit, in protest against bonded labour on Saturday, has led to consternation among the district administration.

A rally of 50 Dalit cyclists was flagged off from Mal Godown Chowk at Mansa by Jai Singh Phillaur, the national president of DDVA, on Saturday.

The rally will reach Rashtrapati Bhawan at New Delhi on September 15, where the protesters would stage a dharna, and demand that the President either implement the laws relating to Dalits or withdraw them, Phillaur said.

Addressing a gathering of Dalits, Phillaur alleged that the rally was being organised to protest against bonded labour and sale and purchase of Dalits in Punjab.

He alleged that despite the prevalence of the medieval system of bonded labour in all districts of Punjab, the bureaucrats were painting a rosy picture by reporting that the practice no longer exists.

The DDVA leaders said that even after 56 years of Independence there was no substantial change in the condition of Dalits in the country. According to Phillaur, in 1976, the Union government had instituted an Act for the eradication of bonded labour in the country.

Under the Act, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) had directed the state governments to constitute district level committees under the chairmanship of deputy commissioner to furnish a report every three months about the number of bonded labour in their respective areas.

Despite the fact that there were over five lakh Dalits in bonded labour, the deputy commissioners allegedly never presented the real picture in their reports, he said.

In Dalel Singh Wala village, there are 150 bonded labourers, but the district administration claimed there are none, Phillaur alleged.

The tradition of sale and purchase of bonded labour in Punjab on Ekadeshi (an auspicious day according to Hindu mythology) is still preva -lent, he alleged.

2,NFDC earns disinvestment commission kudos,"KOLKATA: In the context of cinema, the sum of Rs 72.63 lakh is not spectacular. But when it happens to be the amount that the National Film Development Corporation has paid as dividend, after TDS, to its sole shareholder, the I&B ministry, it narrates a rags-to-riches story. For, it signifies the turnaround of a PSU from a loss of Rs 10 crore in 1998-99 to a net profit of over Rs 4 crore.

Small wonder that I&B minister Ravi Shankar Prasad beamed on Tuesday as he received the cheque for the amount that was Rs 7 lakh more than last yearâ€™s.

â€œEven the disinvestment commission has acknowledged the good work being done by NFDC,â€™â€™ he revealed, â€œand has recommended that NFDC should continue to promote creative film production rather than be disinvested.â€™â€™

That would be music to a host of filmmakers, including Shyam Benegal, Kundan Shah and Rajiv Menon, who had strongly protested the Geetakrishnan Committeeâ€™s recommendation some years back to close down seven organisations under the I&B ministry, involved in the promotion of cinema in India.

â€œCinema cannot be equated with commerce since it is also art,â€™â€™ they had said, â€œand landmarks films like Jaane Bhi Do Yaaron, Bhavni Bhavai and Bhuvan Shome would not have been possible without NFDC.â€™â€™

At one point NFDCâ€™s turnover had come down from Rs 15 crore to Rs 80 lakh. But â€œin the 20-odd years of NFDC we made a loss only in 1998-99,â€™â€™ explained its MD, Dipankar Mukhopadhyay. â€œAnd that was not due to any film.â€™â€™ NFDC films are always made on a modest budget, and they have a long shelf life. Consequently, the recovery rate of its investment â€œis 70 per cent, which is as much if not higher than that of a mainstream producer like Subhash Ghai,â€™â€™ he explained.

Of late, NFDC has realised that like Hollywood, it has viewers for its productions spread in pockets across different countries. â€œSo, if a film does not sell in 20 countries, Hollywood recovers and even profits from 155 other countries.â€™â€™ Following this example, NFDC is aiming at marketing its products to foreign viewers through distribution networks as much as through film festivals.

One such product is director Rajat Kapurâ€™s Raghu Romeo, currently showing at Locarno. Made for less than Rs 1 crore, it is described by Mukhopadhyay as â€œan outstanding comedy that should again prove a turning point like Jaane Bhi Do Yaaron.â€™â€™

If Romeo becomes a hit when itâ€™s released later this year, NFDC can add to its profits that are the only way to put to rest the dangling sword of disinvestment.

7,"CM instigating caste violence, says SP","LUCKNOW: Lambasting chief minister Mayawati for instigating violence between dalit and non-dalit communities to strengthen her vote bank, Samajwadi Party leaders alleged that Mayawati was misusing government fund.

Addressing a press conference regarding the gory incident on August 13 at Tajopur village, in Sarailukhanvi police circle of Mau, SP state executive member Santosh Kumar Singh said that the police were also toeing the BSP line under instructions from IG (zone) Varanasi, Vijay Singh who was a confirmed BSP supporter.

The incident, said Singh, was a direct fallout of irresponsible statements by BSP leaders, the administration, the police and the government were equally responsible. Singh said that â€œthe dalits possessed a large number of illegal weapons which they had used during the clash but, so far, the government had not initiated any inquiry in this regard.â€�

Moreover, he alleged, that Mayawati had been successful in misappropriation of funds, which were being thrown among undeserving dalits, in the garb of compensation for victims of atrocities. â€œIt was high time there was a debate on the biased procedure followed in cases of atrocities on dalits,â€� he demanded. The police atrocities had forced many villagers to fee from their homes.

In the absence of male members who were either arrested or had to flee to escape being arrested on some framed up charges, the police were also harassing women and children, he said adding as there was no fuel, women and children had not been able to eat for days. â€œEven animals were dying as there was no fodder in the village,â€� Singh said. Meanwhile, the dalit community was busy fleecing money from the government by showing minor self-inflicted injuries and claiming compensation against atrocities, he alleged adding that the SP would not permit the government to succeed in its nefarious designs to spark violence between dalit and non-dalit communities.

Earlier, SP leaders also submitted a memorandum to governor Vishnukant Shastri apprising him of the misrepresentation of facts by the government and demanded an inquiry by either the CBI or a High Court judge. The memorandum specified that the Thakur Jainath Singh had got the stay, taken by the dalits with the aim of illegally occupying his land, vacated. The civil court had even passed orders to the effect that Jainath Singh could now take possession of his land.

Jainath had also asked for police protection while he was going to take possession, but the administration did not provide it. When Jainath reached his land, around a hundred dalits attacked him with stones, sticks and spears and later even fired with illegal fire-arms injuring two of Jainathâ€™s relatives. Thereafter, they were forced to fire first in the air and then in self-defence and some dalits were injured, said the memorandum.

8,"Cop commits suicide after shooting wife, daughter","PURI: When 10-year-old Bitu woke up on Independence Day, it was the beginning of a nightmare he had never imagined. He found his father, mother and sister dead.

On Thursday night, West Bengal constable Purukesh Mukherjee, 45, posted at Belgaon in Purulia district, shot himself dead after taking the lives of wife Namita and daughter Sabita with his service revolver at a hotel here.

The Mukherjees had checked into suite 62 of Hotel Sea Foam on Chakratirtha Road on the morning of August 13. The police found two notes, one addressed to the superintendent of police, Puri, and the other to Bitu, in Bengali.

In the first, Mukherjee stated that as he had lost everything to gambling and was shocked by the conduct of his daughter, he was taking the lives of his wife, daughter and self. He also requested the SP to hand over their bodies to his son to perform the last rites at Swargadwar.

The second letter revealed his financial status. When Bitu knocked at the door of the suiteâ€™s ante-room, locked from inside, on Friday morning and got no response, he told the hotel staff. The police broke open the door and found the three in a pool of blood on the floor.

Bitu said all of them went to bed after dinner. While he and his father slept in the main room, his mother and sister slept in the ante room. When he woke up in the morning, he found his pocket heavy with Rs 600 and the two letters.

According to police, Purukesh had stashed the money and letters into Bituâ€™s pocket and then went to the ante room late at night. There, he shot the two before shooting himself.

Purukesh was posted at the armoury with headquarters in Belgaon. Purulia police have been apprised of the incident. The bodies have been sent for post-mortem. Hotel owner Mohit Kumar Das said the Mukherjees had been enjoying themselves.

9,DNA case lands Mufti govt in trouble,"NEW DELHI:The recommendation of Mufti Sayeed government for termination of a senior police official in the DNA fudging case got into troubled waters as findings of the one-man enquiry commission have been disputed by another government department.

The suspended police official, who has been awarded President''s police medal for gallantary, is contemplating challenging the decision.

The state government last month terminated the service of an assistant sub-inspector while recommending to the Centre termination of the services of Senior Superintendent of Police, Jammu, Farooq Khan, possibly the highest decorated cop in the state, for allegedly fudging the DNA test samples of the kins of five persons killed in Pathribal.

The five persons were labelled as foreign militants, who had indulged in killing of 35 Sikhs in Chittisinghpura on the eve of the visit of then US President Bill Clinton to India.

Khan has denied any involvement in the DNA fudging case and questioned the findings of the Commission.

""According to the Sections 10-B and 10-C of the Commission of Inquiry Act, I have the right to cross-examine the witnesses, which was not done in the case,"" Khan said while making it clear that he was going to challenge it as the State Government had left him with no other ""option.""

After appointing a retired judge of High Court, G A Kuchai, as the one-man commission, its findings were sent to the General Administrative Department (GAD) for comments prior to putting these before the state cabinet

Principal Secretary to GAD N R Gupta expressed the view that the inference drawn from the findings of the Commission was that the ""blood samples have been fudged with the malafides. However, the Commission has not been able to pin point responsibility on a particular individual or group of individuals.""

""On the basis of presumption, connivance of Farooq Khan, the then SSP Annantnag, does not seem conclusive and cogent moreso,"" it said while recommending the case be transferred to the CBI so that the ""guilty do not escape the stringent criminal liability.""

Incidentally, the 38-page report of Commission, has noted about the role of the senior cop that ""... Farooq Khan, then SSP, might have managed behind the scene that blood samples collected turn fake by indirect methods.""

""If I am a culprit, may I ask the competent authorities as to why they were unable to find my accomplice in Anantnag who did fudging on my behalf,"" Khan said. He had been transferred out of Anantnag and was under suspension when the samples for DNA test were being taken.

The state cabinet which met to discuss the recommendation of a sub-committee comprising Deputy Chief Minister Mangat Ram Sharma, Ministers Muzzafar Hussain Beig and Taj Mohi-ud-din, recommended to the Centre termination of Khan''s services, ignoring the views expressed by the GAD.

The sub-committee also chose to ignore the fact about the inability of the Commission to question the Army unit which had killed the five people.

""I think, they were trying to look for a scape goat and they found one in me,"" said Khan, who is the first Muslim officer who took a daredevil step in forming Special Task Force in mid 90s when the state police was maintaining a low profile.

Khan, who was chosen for police medal for gallantry, is also a recipient of President''s police medal for meritorious service. He rose from the rank of deputy superintendent of police to SSP and was promoted to prestigious IPS cadre.

While the government started harassing the villagers on complaints lodged by dalits, the police were not taking any action on the FIRs lodged by the others, the memorandum said and stressed that IG Vijay Singh should be stopped from entering Mau and the injured should be re-examined by doctors from outside and the `compensation'' to the `victims'' be withdrawn.

If their demands were not met within a week, Singh said that they would start demonstrations against harassment at the hands of the Mayawati government and the police.

12,CESC unions protest worker cut,"KOLKATA: All the three unions at CESC have joined forces to protest a voluntary retirement scheme proposed by the power utility that is seeking to reduce its workers from 12,899 to around 7,000.

Terming the VRS ""inadequate"", CITU-affiliated CESC Workmen''s Union, AITUC-affiliated CESC Majdoor Samity and INTUC-affiliated Bijli Majdoor Union have called for a better deal.

Sources in the company said the top brass had drawn up a blueprint with manpower requirement at the departments and job norms for each worker. ""With the Electricity Act 2003 coming into force, CESC will lose its monopoly over power supply to 1.8 million consumers across 567 sq. km in and around Kolkata. In this competitive environment, the workforce has to be reduced and wagebill controlled to be competitive,"" they said.

While the unions acknowledged that CESC needed to prune its staff strength, they were opposed to the management arriving at any predetermined figure without consulting the unions.

""Numbers have to be determined through discussions,"" Majdoor Samity joint secretary Vidyasagar Singh said.

Majdoor Samity general secretary Madan Jana also pointed out that in the last round of VRS at the company''s southern generating station at Garden Reach 12 years ago, the offer was optional with many being redeployed.

""In this round, there is no scope for redeployment,"" he said. CESC Workmen''s Union general secretary too felt that the terms of payment should be improved.

In the present form, the minimum payout will be Rs 33,000 for workers with the maximum ceiling at Rs 5 lakh for those close to retirement at supervisory post.

13,Mulayam slams Cong for calling SP a 'regional party',"LUCKNOW: Samajwadi Party president Mulayam Singh Yadav on Sunday slammed the Congress for launching a misinformation campaign about the SP by stating that it was a regional party.

He simultaneously warned the Congress that no alternative government at the Centre could be possible without his party''s support.

An appeal was also made to the SP leaders to extend whole hearted support to the ''chatra andola,'' (student''s movement) to be launched from August 25.

Addressing a sammelan of former and present MPs, MLAs, MLCs, district and block chiefs as also those of the other frontal organizations, Yadav took the Congress party to task for spearheading a campaign, particularly amongst the Muslims, about the SP being a regional party and the Congress a national one.

He said the fact was that the combined MPs of the Congress from the 8 states were equivalent in number to those of the SP from Uttar Pradesh alone.

Continuing with his billigerent stance he made it amply clear to the Congress that any talk of an alternative government at the Centre couldnotbe possible without the support of the SP.

Nearer home he hit out at the coalition government and chief minister Mayawati and said all means were being adopted by her to say in power. He added if the SP decided to adopt the same yardstick then the day would not be far when it would wrest power from her hand.

The Para incident also found a mention in his speech. The SP president said it was unfortunate that people were now being identified and victimised on the basis of whether they were Yadavs or Christians.

He added if the trend continued then a voice would also have to be raised against those who had come from Pakistan after Partition and were holding ministerial posts in the union government.

Asking the assemblage to strengthen the party organization Yadav said the prevailing groupism would have to be done away with.

He also asked them to check the electoral rolls, ensure that their voter identity cards were ready, to read and understand the party''s Constitution and ponder on why the party could not win the requisite number of seats as would have enabled it to form a government on its own steam.

Taking up the cause of the students the SP leader said if inquiries on the kind of education imparted in madarsas would be constituted then similar inquiries should also take place in the case of Shishu mandirs.

Demanding that the elections to the students unions be revived the SP leader said if the present policies were allowed to continue higher education would be outside the reach of the common man.

Appealing to the lawyers and the traders to join hands with the SP in its fight against the prevailing ills, Yadav nominated Virendra Bhatia ad the national president of the ''SP lawyer''s sabha''.

Earlier senior leaders like Janeshwar Mishra, Beni Prasad Verma, Azam Khan and others asked the members to introspect on the the ways the organizational set up could be strengthened and dwell on the factors which were weakening the party.

National convenor of the Samajwadi Yuva Sangathan and MP Akhilesh Yadav said the student movement to be launched from August 25 would raise the demand for the revival of the student union elections,putting a halt to the growing unemployment, providing employment opportunities to the youth,lowering the fee of students and making education available for all.

14,Ex-servicemen urge minister to restore soldiers' honour,"CHANDIGARH: The Poorv Sainik Sabha Parishad, an ex-servicemen (ESM) organisation, on Sunday urged Minister of State for Defence Chaman Lal Gupta to work out an arrangement with the Union home ministry for induction of ex-servicemen into the para-military forces.

Representatives of the parishad said that taking into account that soldiers retired from service while they were still in their 30s, it was important to devise a resettlement programme for them.

The parishad also underscored that the government should seriously strive to implement the one-rank-one-pension norm for soldiers.

The minister was apprised of the problems being faced by families of martyrs and disabled soldiers who were left to fend for themselves after they had given their prime serving the nation. The regular demand of raising the disability pension was raised one more time.

The representatives of the parishad said the new generation was not keen on joining the defence services because of the low renumeration given to personnel who live in extremely harsh conditions defending the motherland.

Stating that the government was sensitive to the problems being faced by soldiers and ESM, the minister assured the parishad that the government would strive to restore the honour of soldiers.

He said that the BJP-led government at the Centre was committed to serve the soldier''s cause.

The bandh had little impact and the examination passed off peacefully, Superintendent of Police Ashish Batra said here.

Supported by the Jharkhand People''s Party of Surya Singh Besra, the bandh was called by AJSU (Vimal Kacchap group) to protest conducting of the preliminary examination of Jharkhand Public Service.

""The government should have spelt out its reservation policy clearly before holding the examination,"" bandh organisers said.

Besra along with 40 supporters were detained at Sakchi in Jamshedpur for violating prohibitory orders, police said.

The Jharkhand High Court in 2002 passed an interim order against the government''s 73 per cent reservation policy asking it not to exceed 50 per cent mark pending a final verdict by the Supreme Court on Tamil Nadu government''s 69 per cent reservation policy.

Over 1.4 lakh candidates appeared in the test on Sunday at 300 centres across the state for 72 posts.

Government offices, educational institutions and shops were closed today on account of Sunday being a holiday.

The state had in the past witnessed widespread violent protests against the government''s job reservation policy which was subsequently withdrawn.

Asking party workers to resolve their differences, he said, ""the party suffered during last Assembly elections in the state due to intra-party fights. The past mistake should not be repeated now.""

Senior party leaders, including Beni Prasad Verma, Shiv Pal Singh Yadav, state President Ram Saran Das and Akhilesh Singh, also addressed the workers.

17,NDA will get majority seats in polls: Naidu,"BANGALORE: The BJP on Sunday dismissed as ""incorrect"" and ""improper"" an opinion poll predicting only 242 to 252 seats for NDA, and claimed that the ruling alliance would get a comfortable majority whenever elections are held.

""I don''t agree with the opinion poll. Sometimes, it goes wrong. The methodology adopted is not proper,"" party President M Venkaiah Naidu told reporters here when asked to comment on the India Today-ORG MARG exercise.

The opinion poll predicted that NDA would fall short of a majority in the event of a snap poll, down from 304 in 1999.

According to him, the opinion poll has aligned the AIADMK with the Congress and put the BSP in the third front bracket which were not correct. Moreover, it has not considered the north-eastern region where, he said, the BJP was getting stronger.

Naidu asserted: ""NDA is very comfortable and there is a feel-good factor about the NDA. We have an able leader, credible performance and allies and good network of workers.""

""Anytime elections are held, we will get a comfortable majority,"" he said.

21,7 hurt in communal clash in Rajasthan town,"JAIPUR: Seven persons were injured when members of two communities clashed and indulged in arson setting on fire 12 kiosks following a petty quarrel between children during a sports event at Salumber in Rajasthan''s Udaipur district on Sunday, a senior official said.

The clash broke out on the grounds of the senior secondary school where the Bharat Vikas Parishad organised a race tournament, Udaipur Divisional Commissioner Sudharshan Sethi said.

Children from the two communities, participating in the vent, clashed over a petty issue during the tournament around 0900 hours and later on the streets in which their elders also joined, he said. Twelve kiosks were set ablaze by the clashing groups.

The injured were discharged after first aid, Sethi said.

The main markets in the town were closed down after the clash, he said.

22,Ghettoisation picks up after riots,"AHMEDABAD: Cricketer Parthiv Patel''s house in the Hindu-inhabited Dhana Suthar ni Pol in communally sensitive Kalupur shares a common wall with Muslim neighbours in Bakar Ali ni Pol and Khiskola Pol.

""We decided to shift out because of the communal violence and continuing tension. It doesn''t take even a second for riots to break out. Parthiv faced great difficulty in going for his practice during the riots,"" says father Ajay Patel. The Patels shifted out of the tense area five months back. And they are not the only ones, who have decided to move to safer localities.

Ghettos were never a new phenomenon in sensitive Ahmedabad. But it seems the recent riots have forced citizens to do away with the last remaining pockets of Hindus and Muslims sharing a neighbourhood. While existing ghettos are beginning to face the pressure of new entrants, new ones are also being formed. The exodus triggered by earlier riots had already led to a population explosion in the existing ghettos. Juhapura, for instance, had only about 50,000 residents till the 1992 riots.

Today, there are around two lakh. Vastrapur and Vejalpur, on the other hand, too have come up with Hindus leaving the old city and its communal baggage. Today, if there are hardly any Muslims in the whole Sarkiwaad in Sarangpur, almost all the Hindus have left Tokarshah ni pol in Jamalpur. Says Mohammad Safi Madni, chairman of Islami Relief Committee, ""In the last one year alone, more than 1000 Muslim families have shifted and settled in minority-dominated areas like Juhapura.""

Former mayor Malini Atit, shifted from Saraspur to Navrangpura in mid-90s. Atit however cites personal reasons behind the decision to shift. Former home minister in Congress government Jitendra Shah, moved out of his in Vasta Gelji ni pol in Shahpur in midnineties.

""I have not fled out of fear,"" laughs Shah. ""I decided to shift to Gandhinagar after I got plot. My old house has been converted into my office."" According to Shah, over 30,000 people have fled from Shahpur alone. ""I believe the Disturbed Areas Act has completely failed to curb the distress sale and migration,"" says Shah. Besides Shah and Atit, there are half a dozen municipal councillors who have shifted to posh areas of western Ahmedabad. To prevent panic selling during riots, the government invoked the Disturbed Areas Act (1991), which does not allow residents to sell their homes without the permission of the district collector after an area has been notified a ''disturbed area''.

Going by the figures available at the collectorate, only 1,738 inter community house transactions have taken place in Ahmedabad since 1994. But according to sources, the law is being circumvented by giving power of attorney to the buyer. ""This saves a lot of time and the transfer fees. Also, there is no ban on giving out a house on long-term lease. If there is physical transfer of house or property without outright sale, the district administration can do precious little since the law does not empower us to prevent ghettoisation,"" says an official of revenue department.

23,UK rights group for Modi's arrest,"LONDON: Narendra Modi began on Sunday a whistle-stop tour through Europe to re-brand Gujarat internationally, but the chief minister may have to shout to make himself heard above the massed protesters pleading for justice.

In particular, Modiâ€™s lawyers may have to prove to a British magistrate that he is not Augusto Pinochet, the former Chilean military leader who was uniquely arrested in the UK in 1998 and detained for 17 months on charges of crimes against humanity.

Just hours before Modi began his first visit to the UK since the Gujarat violence, members of a South Asian human rights organisation claimed they would seek Modiâ€™s arrest on Tuesday through the court of a Bow Street magistrate, where public interest cases are heard. However, observers said the Modi affidavit may turn out to be no more than a â€œgimmickâ€�.

But, Modiâ€™s London visit began with an altogether sunnier community event near Wembley stadium, attended by 2,400 Gujaratis. The chief ministerâ€™s main message, said organiser Anil Pota, general secretary of the Overseas Friends of the BJP, is to seek the help of Gujaratis everywhere for his â€˜Vibrant Gujaratâ€™ initiative.

Modi is to meet representatives of oil company Shell in the UK and several leading business groups during his next stop in Zurich and Geneva. The European tour will culminate in a â€˜global investorsâ€™ meetingâ€™ late next month in Ahmedabad, where Fortune 500 companies will be invited to invest in a state that is peaceful and prosperous.

Prominent Gujarati poet Praful Amin in Birmingham, said non-resident Gujaratis â€œare backing Modiâ€� and it was time for reconciliation. However, the relatives of two British Gujaratis from Yorkshire, who lost their lives in the Gujarat violence, publicly endorsed the mass protests and calls for justice for their loved ones.

Meanwhile, in a move expected by some critics to generate column-inches if nothing else, Suresh Grover of human rights group Awaaz-South Asia Watch told this paper he was filing an affidavit for Modiâ€™s arrest at the Bow Street magistrateâ€™s court along with London School of Economics professor Gautam Appa.

Grover said: â€œThe application is made on our behalf under the European Conventions Human Rights Act, but obviously, there are three options before the magistrate. He could throw the case out; he could ask Modi to attend court, or could issue a warrant of arrest.â€�
