0,Cong hopes to stop SAD's political plans,"DAMDAMA SAHIB: With the Lok Sabha elections round-the-corner, all political parties are eyeing the Baisakhi festival at Takht Damdama Sahib here to give an impetus to their election campaign.

All leaders of SAD (Badal), Congress and Akali Dal (Mann) are in top gear to mobilise their rank and file at the mela to outwit their rivals.

Though no political party had ever raised objection to the misuse of the occasion for political purposes, this year the Congress, the CPI and the Akali Dal (Mann) have raised their voice against use of Diwan Hall at the Takht Damdama Sahib for the political conference of SAD (Badal).

Three days ago, the Congress, the CPI and Mann group leaders had staged a walkout from a meeting of returning officer, Bathinda, demanding to prohibit the Akalis from using the Diwan Hall. For the last many decades, the SAD is using the Diwan Hall for political conferences.

Akalis leaders, however, claimed that it has always been a religious congregation. But the three parties pointed out that as the Akalis use this occasion to criticise the Congress and other parties, it is a clear-cut violation of the election code of conduct.

The assistant returning officer, Talwandi Sabo, has urged the Takht Damdama Sahib authorities to ensure that Diwan Hall is not used for political purpose and the congregation of April 14 should be limited to religious preaching.

1,Tu Tu Main Main hits peak as polls draw near,"HYDERABAD: With just a week left for the elections, political mudslinging has reached a crescendo in the state.

Second-rung leaders of the TDP and the Congress are straining the leash in letting loose invective and innuendo against their political opponents.

On Sunday, TDP leader Nannapaneni Rajakumari joined the game. Responding to Congress heavyweight Y S Rajasekhara Reddyâ€™s challenge to Chandrababu Naidu to join him in an open debate on development, she said in Guntur, ""The former CLP leader is not worthy of taking part in a debate with the chief minister. I am more than enough for him.""

She proceeded to ask Rajasekhara Reddy whether his father had stashed away some money (babu sommu) to give offer cheaper loans to Dwcra women.

Mahila Congress leaders were provoked by this. On Monday, Rangareddy district Mahila Congress president Sumati Mohan hit back at Rajakumari, saying she practices opportunistic politics and changed parties like drop of a hat. ""You carry mud (burada gunta) with you and leave traces everywhere,"" Sumati countered.

TRS womenâ€™s wing president Shobha Rani too levelled serious charges against party president K Chandrashekhara Rao stating that he lives in a â€˜darbarâ€™ during the day and spends time in a â€˜barâ€™ at night. The rest of the women leaders in TRS lost no time in lampooning Shobha. ""You praised Chandrashekhar Rao as a hero who can achieve Telangana. Once you are denied the party ticket, you started abusing him,"" TRS city president Sukanya, state secretaries Sulochana and V Ratnamala said in their counte.

2,Shinde to drop 27 ministers from jumbo cabinet,"MUMBAI: Come July 7 and chief minister Sushilkumar Shinde will have to chop 27 ministers from his 69-member jumbo cabinet as per the new legislation passed by parliament and approved by President A P J Abdul Kalam.

As per the provisions, the strength of state cabinets can only be 15 per cent of the total strength of the respective state assemblies. Since the Maharashtra assembly has 288 members, the new cabinet can have a maximumof 42 members. The pruning will take place after the six-week budget session, which begins here on May 24.

Shinde has made it known that all those who fail to retain their constituencies for the party in the forthcoming Lok Sabha elections will face the axe. He hopes that this will force the ministers to take their campaigning seriously.

Shinde will have to sit down with NCP president Sharad Pawar to decide how to go about the pruning exercise, which is not expected to be a smooth affair.

One option is to drop all the ministers of state and retain the cabinet ministers, since Maharashtra will be holding assembly elections in September, but this is not a politically advisable move given that many of the ministers of state are influential and can create trouble for Shinde.

According to informed sources, the independent ministers are going to prove a real problem for the chief minister.

The minority DF government is surviving with the help of the independents who have already gone to Delhi and called on Congress president Sonia Gandhi to discuss their problems. They have sought an assurance from Gandhi and Pawar that both the parties will not put up candidates in the assembly constituencies represented by them.

3,Condolences laced with politics,"LUCKNOW: Dirty politics over dead bodies was on display at KGMU mortuary where victims of Lalji Tandon''s birthday bash stampede were brought for post-mortem on Monday afternoon.

As relatives wailed over the loss of their dear ones, politicians of all political parties shamelessly squabbled to score points over each other.

BJP (read Tandon) supporters crossed all limits when they bashed up an anyone who tried to utter a single word against their ''popular leader'', who in turn was conspicuous by his absence.

The tragedy occurred at around 2.30 pm and by 3.30 pm ten bodies arrived at KGMU emergency centre â€” all were declared brought dead. Bodies were shifted to the mortuary.

At 4.04 pm, the district magistrate Aradhana Shukla arrived. While one of her cellphone was engaged with continuous calls, she lend the other one to victims.

She could spare only two minutes for aggrieved relatives and spent the remaining time of her ten-minute visit replying to media queries.

When SP leader Ravi Das Mehrotra arrived minutes later, he too appeared more interested in issuing anti-BJP statements to the media after offering customary condolences to family members of victims.

At this, BJP activists led by Sadashiv Mishra and Anurag Mishra pounced on him and started hurling choicest of abuses. ""$&$#@...rajniti karta hai..."", they shouted forcing the outnumbered Mehrotra to retreat.

Then both BJP and SP leaders made frantic calls for help: Yahan bawal ho gaya...jitne aadmi aa sakte ho aa jayo... (There is ruckus here. Get as many men as you can here). Terrified relatives deserted the place.

Taking lessons from the Mehrotra incident, BSP leaders, worked cleverly and quietly. One BSP leader (standing beside wailing family members of the victim) was overheard taking instructions from some senior leader about party''s ranniti over deaths.

Zara pooch kar bataiye kya statement dena hai. Others quietly instigated the crowd, Tandonji nahin dikhayin pad rahein hain.

At around 5.30 pm suddenly a large posse of policemen descended. The chief minister was coming.

The CM in his brief visit, ''showered'' condolences and sympathy and left the place saying that there should be ''no politics'' over the deaths. Thereafter PM''s personal assistant Shiv Kumar sneaked in from the back entrance and left within minutes.

All Indian Democratic Women Association, state president, Madhu Garg, also came to locate two women of her organisation, who had died in the stampede.

She announced that her organisation would burn the effigy of Lalji Tandon on Tuesday. At this, BJP workers hurled abuses and mobbed Madhu and her associate. Security forces had a tough time taking out the two women from the venue.

The wrath of BJP workers then fell on a woman police constable. Till then word had spread that prime minister would be coming to meet family members of victims.

Her only fault was that she mentioned about the inconvenience caused to people due to the high profile visit of the prime minister. They rushed after her to vent their anger, while policemen struggled to save her.

Thereafter, the place was taken over by the police and security forces. Aggrieved family members were asked to sit patiently for some more time. They were told, ""Prime minister is coming. He may announce compensation...""

5,"SC fixes rules of game, asks EC to play referee","NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court gave the refereeâ€™s job to the Election Commission on Tuesday to stop mudslinging through ads in the run-up to the Lok Sabha polls.

Framing comprehensive gui-delines for election ads, a Bench headed by Chief Justice V N Khare made it mandatory for parties to submit particulars about a campaign ad to the EC, which would then vet it.

The new transparency reg-ime will require individuals issuing political ads submit details seven days before telecast. The SC also armed the EC with powers to seize equipment of a TV channel or cable operator who violates the regulations.

The political parties, contesting candidates or any other person wanting to telecast an ad in the electronic media should give an affidavit to the EC disclosing its cost of production, total cost of the ad, whether the ad is for a particular party or a candidate and whether it is issued by persons or a trust.

The affidavit would also disclose whether it was funded by a political party or for the benefit of candidates.

The Bench made it mandatory for advertisers to make payments only through cheques and demand drafts. The order will remain in force from April 16 till May 10 and the provision of Section 126 of the RPA, prohibiting canvassing for votes 48 hours before the polls would apply to electronic media ads.

6,HC tightens I-T screw on lawyers,"NEW DELHI: Itâ€™s not just their wardrobe that has shades of black and white now. Advocates looking for promotion as â€˜â€˜seniorsâ€™â€™ will have to file their tax returns in the High Court, a development that threatens to create a Bar-Bench rift.

Now, you have to file returns as a matter of routine. But the lawyers have taken the stipulation as an affront, almost indicating that they should be above tax laws.

This has snowballed into a face-off that is making lawyers shun seniority. For existing senior lawyers, the court has threatened withdrawal of rank unless they file returns.
