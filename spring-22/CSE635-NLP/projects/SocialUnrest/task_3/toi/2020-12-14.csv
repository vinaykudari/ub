1,The ministers and their new clothes,"NEW DELHI: Arvinder Singh Lovely, minister-designate in the Delhi cabinet did not need to go shopping for the right outfit for his swearing in ceremony on Monday. The moment his name was announced, his tailor Amit whipped out an all black suit for Lovely to wear.

""Black is my favourite colour, and I will wear my lucky maroon pagri with it,"" he said.

Lovely who is getting a cabinet berth for the first time is expectedly excited. However, second time minister Raj Kumar Chauhan went down memory lane to remember the late industries minister Deep Chand Bandhu.

""I remember when we had just become ministers, Bandhuji was going to get a suit stitched. When Haroon Yusuf and I found out, we decided to tag along, and Ajay Maken also hoined us and we all got suits done. When it was time to pay the nearly Rs 80,000 bill, Bandhuji insisted on paying since he was the eldest among us,"" he said.

Chauhan and Yusuf will be wearing sombre black bandhgalas at the ceremony, more as a concession to the winter more than anything else. The unrelieved black will be have a silver lining in the shape of first time minister Mangat Ram Singhal''s silver-grey suit.

""Delhi is a city where one should always be dressed as a baraati, I have got a new suit stiched for myself especially for this day,"" he said.

However, the ""elders"" of the camp A K Walia and Yoganand Shastri appear sanguine about the big day, more concerned with the portfolios they will get rather than the shirts on their back.

""We''ve been closeted in meetings with the chief minister the whole evening, barely having time for all this,"" said Walia. Both Walia and Shastri are expected to wear bandhgalas.

A face to be missed in the photo-op would be the dapper Ajay Maken who brought style back to the sachivalaya with his casual Friday dressing. Clothes may not maketh the man, but a good wrapper never hurt a gift.

2,Providing help to pregnant women is not govt's cup of tea,"HYDERABAD: The state government which has been claiming that it has done very well in providing help to pregnant women under the Sukhibhava programme, appears to have badly slipped in its implementation.

The main reason for this, according to official sources, is lack of enthusiasm among district officials even though the government has earmarked Rs 550 crore for this programme. Under the scheme, pregnant women are to be provided with a nutritious diet. This programme is to be implemented with the help of anganwadi workers who are supposed to be selected by mothersâ€™ committees in the districts. But it has suffered setback for various reasons.

In Kadapa district, officials are facing problems in appointing anganwadi workers due to a lack of unanimity in the selection of the teachers. The rule book says anganwadi workers should be selected by a majority of the members of the committee. But with there being only two members in the committee, a majority was not possible at all.

Chief minister Chandrababu Naidu on Thursday directed the district administration to increase the number of committee members from two to three. In Krishna and Kurnool districts, officials say that serving nutritious food to pregnant women is a problem because the pre-school teachers think it as a waste of time. Instead, teachers suggest that the food be delivered to the women directly at their homes.

The state government cannot agree to the suggestion made by teachers because it says that there is no guarantee that the food sent to houses will serve the purpose, sources said. In Ranga Reddy district 13,669 mothers were identified to be given Rs 300 under the Sukhibhava programme but merely 1902 women received the benefit. It is said that many of the pregnant women who visit the primary health centres are not even aware of the scheme.

Most of the districts have not maintained any statistics of child mortality. Stung by these facts, the state government has now directed the district collectors to fix responsibility on the officials concerned and also send a consolidated report to the state government every month.

3,Central grant for slum development schemes hiked,"KOLKATA: The Union urban development ministry''s decision to raise the central subsidy from 50 per cent to 75 per cent for the Valmiki Ambedkar Awas Yojana (VAMBAY) has come as a shot in the arm for the West Bengal government.

The awas yojana, which is a housing scheme for slum dwellers in urban areas, is being implemented across the country. Reacting to this D. Mukherjee, principal secretary of the state urban development department, said the decision might help the state to iron out certain problems relating to the implementation of the project. In the 2002-''03 financial year the state could utilise only Rs 14 crore out of the Centre''s sanctioned Rs 27 crore, he said. In the current financial year, the state has spent Rs 10 crore till now while the amount sanctioned was Rs 25 crore.

""We have been facing serious problems in implementing this programme as there is a pre-condition that there should be a beneficiary for each single scheme. For the on-going schemes the Centre has given 50 per cent of the total cost while the rest is being subsidised by the beneficiaries. ""The proposed hike in central subsidy will help us,"" Mukherjee said.

Union urban development minister Bandaru Dattatraya recently announced the raise. He said the subsidy for the North-eastern states will be around 90 per cent. The proposal for a hike in subsidy will now be sent to the Union Cabinet for final approval. Mukherjee, however, said development authorities at the state-level like the Haldia Development Authority, the Durgapur Development Authority and the Siliguri Development Authority, are implementing housing projects under this scheme.
