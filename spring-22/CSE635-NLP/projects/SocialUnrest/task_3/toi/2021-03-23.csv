0,'Plot for Shivaji memorial gifted by DF govt',"MUMBAI: Calling Maharashtra''s home minister and state NCP president R R Patil''s and his party''s love for Shivaji a ""sudden phenomenon"", state BJP general secretary Vinod Tawde Tawde alleged that a vast tract of land reserved at Filmcity in Goregaon for a Shivaji memorial had been allotted by the Front government to a film producer.

He also charged that the DF government had been permitting celebrations at Afzal Khan''s tomb at Pratapgad near Mahabaleshwar with a view to ""appeasing"" a minority community.

The fact that Khan was an aggressor against Shivaji''s kingdom had been overlooked by the DF regime for garnering Muslim votes, he said.

Tawde also pointed out that the NCP and its president Sharad Pawar had abjectly surrendered before a person of foreign origin (Congress president Sonia Gandhi) with a view to winning seats in the coming election.

The BJP leader charged that the home minister wanted to divert the people''s attention from issues like the drought ravaging the state.

1,VHP bandh paralyses life in Powai,"MUMBAI: An uneasy calm prevailed in the Filterpada area of Powai following Sunday''s rioting by Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) activists who were angry about police ''inaction'' the previous night when two of their activists were murdered.

Although there was heavy police bandobast in the slum, life was far from normal.

Situated on the Powai-Aarey Colony road, Filterpada is a cluster of a few thousand households with a mix of Hindus and Muslims.

While some sections of the locality are Muslim-dominated, others are predominantly Hindu with a handful of Muslim homes.

According to locals, several Muslim families left the area on Sunday, anticipating danger to their lives. Others decided to skip work.

How did the police fail to anticipate Sunday''s rioting? ""We had deployed policemen in the area from Saturday night, since we expected tension,"" said police chief A N Roy, refuting charges of being caught unawares.

""What happened was stray incidents of stone-pelting, and we arrested the rioters. If we hadn''t taken any action, matters would have been far worseâ€” there would have been arson and looting.""

Shops and commercial establishments in Powai came to a standstill on Monday in response to the VHP-sponsored bandh.

Local activist Qazi Nizamuddin alleged that ""outsiders"" were involved in Sunday''s rioting in which vehicles were damaged and houses stoned.

""Karta koi aur hai, bharta koi aur (Innocents are paying the price for riots),"" remarked an elderly woman.

Locals have no kind words for either the murder victims- -Navinchandra Dube and H P Upadhyayaâ€”or the suspects, members of a Pathan family.

""Both had criminal backgrounds,"" remarked Ayub Farooqi of Al-Aman chawl society.

Police sources confirmed that Dube and members of Sher Khan''s household, which has been accused of the doublemurder, had criminal cases against them.

A senior police officer alleged that both Dube and Sher Khan ran a drug-peddling business from Powai. Relations between the two turned sour in 2001 after Dube was discovered to be having illicit relations with woman from the Khan household.

Thereafter, Dube tipped off the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) which raided a godown in Powai and seized mandrax. One of the Khan family members, Akram Khan, was arrested and jailed for ten years in the case.

According to the police, Dube''s murder was pre-planned.VHP regional secretary Venkatesh Abdev claimed that he was unaware about Dube''s criminal cases.

He said Dube and his associate Upadhyaya were killed because they had exposed the Khanfamily''s prostitution and hooch rackets.

Meanwhile, the Vikhroli Parksite police picked up 14 VHP activists for taking out a procession in violation of prohibitory orders.

Leaders say, on condition of anonymity, that it is difficult to fight an election without liquor.

6,IIM-Indore endorses govt fee cut,"NEW DELHI: Using the poor-rich divide, the HRD ministry seems to have got two of six IIMs to endorse its fee cut fiat. After IIM-Lucknow, the ministry has found another ally in IIM-Indore.

On Monday, IIM-Indore passed a resolution accepting the Centreâ€™s decision to slash its fees by 80 per cent.

While the faculty councils of the three big IIMs, namely Ahmedabad, Bangalore and Kolkata, have already denounced the fee cut, it is understood that IIM-Kozhikode is likely to take the ministryâ€™s line.

The divide is clear: It is the HRD ministry, supported by the â€˜youngerâ€™ IIMs, which are still hugely dependent on the government funds, versus the cash-rich â€˜big threeâ€™.

The board of governors of IIM Ahmedabad, Kolkata and Bangalore are slated to meet soon to take a final position on the fee cut.
