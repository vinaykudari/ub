0,'Bihar govt's action against Togadia undemocratic',"KOLKATA: Union minister of state for Home, Swami Chinmayananda on Friday described as a violation of democracy the Bihar government''s action in packing-off VHP International General Secretary, Praveen Togadia from Patna airport when he arrived to participate in Independence Day celebrations.

""The Rabri Devi government acted at the behest of the Congress to hustle Togadia to Delhi from Patna airport after he arrived from Mumbai,"" Chinmayananda, who is a member of the VHP, told PTI here.

""This is a democracy and each of us has the right to go to the people. The treatment meted out to Togadia was grossly in violation of the democratic set up,"" the minister said.

Chinmayananda was of the opinion that the situation where Togadia was to participate in the celebrations was unlike what the Bihar government sought to project.

Togadia, earlier in the day, was not allowed to come out of the LNJP International airport at Patna and was made to board the same flight to Delhi by the Patna district authorities.

The Patna district administration had also banned all programmes of Togadia and clamped section 144 of CRPC apprehending breach of peace in Patna sub-division area during his visit.

1,Basu calls for dislodging BJP-led NDA govt,"KOLKATA: A day after Congress tabled a no-confidence motion against the BJP-led NDA government, veteran CPI(M) leader Jyoti Basu on Friday said BJP was the ''main enemy of the country'', and called for dislodging the coalition at the Centre to end its ''misrule''.

Without referring to the no-confidence motion, Basu, a CPI(M) Politburo member told a Left Front-sponsored meeting that the political situation in the country made it incumbent upon all secular parties to form an alternative against BJP.

Basu who reiterated that his party would support the Congress to form the government at the Centre after the next Lok Sabha election, however, clarified that CPI(M) would not ally with it.

The former chief minister also welcomed the ''changed stance'' of the Congress in favour of coalition politics.

""Perhaps Congress is not sure of getting an absolute majority to form the government on its own. And they (Congress) have told me that they would form an United Front government if the NDA government was voted out of power in the next Lok Sabha poll,"" Basu said.

The meeting came days after the dinner hosted by the CPI(M) for opposition leaders in Delhi at which it was decided to take on the BJP.

""Earlier Congress was against alliances and wanted to form the government on its own. It is good that they changed their stand and now favour coalition politics,"" Basu said.

He said it was unfortunate that such an experient failed earlier when the Vajpayee government fell in 1996 after losing by a vote.

2,Doctors stage a sit-in to protest arrest,"LUCKNOW: The arrest of Dr Gufran Rashid following the death of a patient in a city nursing home snowballed into a major issue on Thursday as hundreds of private practitioners and private nursing home owners staged a sit-in at Hazratganj. Amidst high drama and impassioned speeches, the doctors denounced ""selective action"" by a biased administration"" and demanded protection from alleged police high-handedness.

One Azra Haleem, wife of a local lawyer Jamil Ahmed, had died after a gall bladder operation in a private nursing home last fortnight. Ahmed later lodged an FIR charging Dr Gufran, who had operated upon Azra, of criminal negligence. The charge was later converted into culpable homicide not amounting to murder. Subsequently, the doctor was arrested and sent to jail as lawyers thronged the court room and demanded stern action against him on Thursday.

Addressing the gathering, Dr SK Bhasin, president of private nursing homes association, said the city police had double standards. ""While it turns a blind eye to the follies of influential people like Amarmani Tripathi, who has till date managed to evade his arrest despite his alleged complicity in murder, it harasses law-abiding citizens,"" he charged.

""Azra Haleem died due to complications which had nothing to do with incompetence or negligence or mal-intention of the surgeon,"" he further said.

President of IMA Dr Neeraj Bora said that ""the police action puts the doctors in a quandary. Now we will not easily accept complicated cases and this would lead to much misery to the common man,"" he added.

There was much resentment among the agitating doctors over the deliberate conspiracy to nail Gufran. The CJM had allowed bail but the lawyers refrained the peon from serving it. Thus the doctor who is still languishing in jail will continue to be lodged there till Monday, said Bora.

Dr Madhu Gupta showed a copy of an order issued by the former director general of police Sriram Arun. While conceding that cases of harassment against doctors were on the rise, Arun had insisted on a thorough probe before taking any action against a doctor. ""Only FIR cannot be made the basis for arresting a doctor,"" said Gupta.

Later, ACM Tripathi reached the spot and told the doctors that bail papers had been sent to jail and Dr Gufran would be released soon. However, the doctors remained adamant on demand for a probe into the incident and stringent action against the erring police officer.

3,"Nurture patriotism, says Amarinder","KAPURTHALA: Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh on Friday exhorted the people of Punjab to nurture the feeling of patriotism , nationalism and communal harmony.

He, however, regretted that the ""ideals which inspired our forefathers to make selfless sacrifices for the nation still remain largely unfulfilled, despite our being a sovereign nation for over 50 years.''''

Speaking on the 57th state level Independence Day function held at Guru Nanak Dev Stadium here, after unfurling the National Flag, Amarinder paid rich tributes to the freedom fighters. He said whenever the country faced any threat from within or outside, the Punjabis had shown phenomenal courage in making sacrifices.

The Punjab government had declared 2003 as the â€˜Year of Development'' and to give a boost to diversification in agriculture, the government had recently announced a new agricultural policy which encouraged contract farming.

A new industrial policy to create conducive investment climate through infrastructure development, rationalised regulation and controls, promotion and planning, was also being provided.

4,Probe ordered into constable's suicide attempt,"PUNE: The superintendent of police (Pune rural), Madhav Sanap, has directed the Wadgaon-Maval police station to submit a report about the alleged attempt to suicide by a police constable attached to the station.

Sanap has also sought an explanation why the police station failed to register a case. The constable, Sanjay Lambakane (32), had consumed a pesticide on August 5 at his residence and recovering in a city hospital.

He allegedly tried to commit suicide because he was transferred to the Indapur police station, which was not convenient for him, and his superiors refused to take notice of the matter.

5,New rules for minority colleges soon,"HYDERABAD: The government will come out with a new set of guidelines before January for both the admission process and fee structure to be followed by the unaided minority and nonminority professional colleges in the state in the light of the Supreme Courtâ€™s latest judgment on capitation fee.

From next year onwards, the unaided professional colleges should admit students based either on the common entrance test conducted by the government or a joint entrance examination conducted by an association of all the colleges. The option of choosing, between either of the these tests, must be exercised before issuing of prospectus and duly intimating to the authorities concerned, sources in the education department told The Times of India.

Moreover, the answer scripts of the entrance test must be preserved for a few years to check for any irregularities. If it is found that any student has been admitted on considerations other than merit, the penalty could be imposed on the institute and in appropriate cases, recognition or affiliation may also be withdrawn, the sources said.

If any professional college chooses not to recognise the common entrance test conducted by the association of minority and non-minority professional colleges, then the college must necessarily admit students qualified in the common entrance test conducted by the government.

After holding the common entrance test and declaration of results, the merit list will immediately be placed on the notice board of all the colleges. A copy of the merit list should also be sent to the department concerned. The selection of students must be done strictly as per the merit list displayed on the notice board, the sources added. Further, the list of students admitted along with the rank obtained by them , fees collected and other relevant particulars should be submitted to the government to maintain transparency in the admission process.

The government would separately fix management quota in each minority and non-minority unaided professional colleges. The government has decided to come out with new rules as several minority colleges made admissions flouting the rules of the state government. Students alleged that several colleges did not took merit into consideration while admitting students and collected huge sums to grant admission. Some colleges have also conducted a separate entrance test.

11,Police cusotdy of Telgi's lawyer extended,"PUNE: Judicial Magistrate First Class, M N Bondre on Saturday extended the police custody of Abdul Rashid Sikandar Saheb Kulkarni alias Rafique Kulkarni, the lawyer of Abdul Karim Telgi, the al-leged kingpin in the Rs 3000-crore fake stamp paper racket to police custody till August 22.

Demanding his police custody special public prosecutor, Raja Thakare told the court that there was a possibility of more arrests in the scam after the arrest of Kulkarni.

He also disclosed that Kulkarni had helped Telgi in the financial transactions in the scam.

He said more investigation needs to be done about these transac-tions and hence the custody of Kulkarni was necessary.

Thakare added Kulkarni was an important part of the chain involved in the fake stamp scam.

Defence counsels, said there was too much media hype and undue pressure was being put on Kulkarni.

They added that being a counsel of someone does not mean that he was involved in the scam.

Meanwhile the court Saturday rejected the medical application filed by Samajwadi Janata Party Dhule MLA, Anil Gote.

Gote had re-quested a medical check in the Sassoon Hospital. It may be recalled that Gote was arrested in the scam on June 29 for allegedly helping Telgi.

In another significant decision, a special court on Saturday rejected the bail application of Manoj Mehta, an accused in the fake scam who is being booked under Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act.

Mehta had moved bail application and had told the court in the application that he had taken money from Telgi but did not know why he was taking the money.

He had also stated that he had returned the money to Telgi. He had argued that his further custody was not necessary.

13,"Cops bust fake passport racket in B'kantha, two policemen arrested","PALANPUR: The Banaskantha police have busted a gang of frauds selling fake passports. Eight persons have been arrested in this regard from Kanodar, Palanpur and Jasleni villages. A total of 31 cases have been registered against the accused. Among the absconders in the fake passport racket are two police officials â€” an ASI of taluka police L K Parmar and a head constable.

A case against the duo, as well as the other accused, has been registered at the local police station. The police have recovered fake letter pads, rubber stamps and computers, which were used to produce the bogus certificates used for verification and issuance of the passports. According to deputy superintendent of police M H Parmar, 31 cases have been registered under sections 465, 467 of IPC and the Passport Act.

Police officials said that the culprits charged Rs 25,000 for quick issuance of passport. Around 50 fake passports have been recovered by the police. Investigators of the case, however, said that many other fake passports could be in circulation as the main accused, Hasanali Karimbhai Sunaasara of Kanodar village, had been operating this business since the last two years.

The police believe that, at least, 25 persons have gone to different countries on the basis of these bogus passports. Police sources said that the actual number of persons availing foreign tours on basis of these fake documents will come to light only after the investigation is over. Speaking to TNN, inspector of local crime branch (LCB) K B Khant said, â€œAnishali Mohammedali Ami of Kanodar village was caught preparing fake letter pads of the collector and superintendent of police of Banaskantha district, along with those of sponsors and travellers.â€�

Kanth added that another gang member, Chirag Dhirajlal Raval, had been entrusted with the job of production of fake rubber stamps in the name of deputy collector, police officers, sponsors and travellers. The racket came to light when the police verification for the passport of one Vipulkumar Narendrabhai Modh of Jasleni Village was put up before SP C R Parmar for verification.

Paramar ordered an inquiry in the case as the documents seemed suspicious. In all the 31 cases, the passports were found to be invalid as some were issued to fake names while others had been issued on the basis of fake documents such as school leaving certificate, verification letter of the collector, sponsor certificate and travellersâ€™ approval certificates.

14,Plea to arrest policeman in Lal Akhada case,"VADODARA: Anti-terrorist squad police inspector Murali Mudaliar is in the eye of a controversy yet again.

The defence panel of former deputy mayor Nisar Bapu has sought his arrest for failing to respond to summons in the Lal Akhada murder case. In an application it has sought issue of an arrest warrant against Mudaliar who is already serving a suspension in another case. The application was filed as Mudaliar did not respond to three summons.

The defence panel stated that the arrest warrant has to be sent through the Inspector General of Police, ATS. As he was serving a suspension, Murali had informed the IGP that he would go to Bangalore, his native place. He left the phone and fax number. The summons had been faxed on these numbers but he did not respond. Mudaliar was inspector at the City police station when the Lal Akhada murder occurred last year. He was posted at Surat when some material evidence was stolen from his police station, leading to an inquiry and his susp e n -s i o n.

During the suspension he was t r a n s -f e r red to the ATS. Former deputy mayor Nisar Bapu along with his son Abid, sonin law Akram Ahmedmiyan Sheikh, Maruf Saiyed,Mohammed Ishaq, and Arif Sheikh alias Bekabar have been accused in the Lal Akhada murder case in which one Pankaj Chauhan was stabbed to death at Resham wali Gali near Champaner on March 22, 2002.

15,"As PTCs ignore govt schools, HSC pass-outs to fill vacancies","VADODARA: The Vadodara District Primary Education office (DPEO) has once again launched a recruitment drive to appoint primary teachers to fill up 1,412 vacancies in government primary schools.

Despite 5,500 qualified teachers passing out of the primary teachersâ€™ certificate (PTC) training colleges in Gujarat every year, the government has plans to appoint standard XII science candidates. The reason being that in the past three years, PTC graduates have cold-shouldered government schools. In 2002, only 294 applicants had turned up for interviews to fill up 1,600 vacancies.

Says District Primary Education Officer R M Baria,â€œWe hardly manage to get 300 PTC qualified candidates in our recruitment drives. Vadodara has 2,205 primary schools and a total of 8,105 teachers. But there is vacancy for 1,412 posts, which we plan to fill up by implementing new schemes like appointing Vidya Sahayaks and giving preference to local candidates.â€�

â€œTalukas such as Naswadi, Jetpur, Savli and Chhota Udepur have always had vacancies. This has resulted in overburdening of existing teachers. Vadodara taluka has always had very few local candidates undergoing PTC training. And as a majority of the trainees are from Surat, Bharuch, Dahod, Panchmahals and Valsad, most prefer schools near their place of residence,â€� points Baria.

Most schools in the rural and tribal areas have vacancies that never get filled, complains a primary teacher at a school in Savli taluka. â€œI am managing three classes with a student strength of 180 each. It is almost two years since we had adequate staff in our school,â€� she laments.

â€œThe schools in the rural and tribal areas have very few takers as they don not even have proper approach roads.With a remuneration of Rs 2,200-2,500 per month, it becomes difficult for the teachers to commute to far flung places. Moreover, the commitment to duty is also fast declining,â€� says Aratiben Varma, cluster co-ordinator of Koyli Resource Centre. Some believe that owing to poor remuneration, the candidates are not serious about work. In the past, a few teachers have been pulled up for simultaneously running a business or pursuing another career.

Despite the fact that very few are taking up the job, what is surprising is the growing number of students at the PTC colleges each year. â€œJust two years back we had only three government PTC colleges, but now the total number is seven. Four self-financed colleges have come up in the district as there is great demand for the course,â€� says P R Vakil, a senior lecturer at the Government Basic Training College for Men, Vadodara.

â€œA Vidya Sahayak gets Rs 2,500 per month and after two years the post is made permanent and the salary fixed any where between Rs 4,000 to Rs 7,000. This could be the main reason for candidates backing out,â€� says a block co-ordinator. However, the only hope of the DPEO and the â€˜burdenedâ€™ teachers of rural schools is to find candidates to fill up the huge number of vacancies in the district.

16,Marad violence: BJP reiterates demand for CBI probe,"THRISSUR: BJP Kerala state President P S Sreedharan Pillai on Saturday reiterated his party''s demand for a CBI enquiry into the May 2 Marad carnage which claimed nine lives.

Addressing a meet-the-press programme here, Pillai alleged Chief Minister A K Antony was reluctant to recommend such a probe under pressure from a small section of Muslim League MLAs. The league MLAs were scared of a CBI probe as it would bring out the truth, he said.

Rehabilitation of Muslim families who had fled Marad after the incident would be impracticable if the state government did not order a CBI enquiry, he said.

He described as ''strange'' the joint statement by Congress and CPI-M leaders at New Delhi recently that all efforts would be made to throw out the BJP from power.

It was an ''opportunistic'' stand by two parties which had diametrically opposite ideologies.

17,Cong worried about Vidarbha developments,"MUMBAI: The Maharashtra Congress Pradesh Committee is worried about the meeting called by veteran party leader N K P Salve in Nagpur on Sunday to press for a separate Vidarbha state.

Congressmen in Vidarbha are trying to emulate the example of Congress legislators in AP who have tendered their resignations to underscore their demand for a separate Telangana state.

The Congress Working Committee, which had put Vidarbha on the back burner, is troubled by the new developments and has asked MPCC president Ranjit Deshmukh to keep a close watch on them.

Deshmukh, incidentally, is from Vidarbha and a vociferous votary of a separate Vidarbha state. MPCC sources said that though senior leaders like Vasant Sathe and Banwarilal Purohit had extended support to the meeting, there was no open backing from ministers or legislators â€”Satish Chaturvedi, Anil Deshmukh, Anees Ahmed, Manikaro Thackeray and Vasudha Deshmukh will stay away.

""The party has not rejected the demand for a separate Vidharbha stateâ€”in fact, Sonia Gandhi has appointed a highpowered committee under the chairmanship of Pranab Mukherjee for this,"" said Vayalar Ravi, AICC general secretary in charge of Maharashtra.

""So thereâ€™s really no need for such a meeting."" Indeed, the CWC has also passed a resolution asking the union government to set up a second States Reorganisation Commission to consider demands for the formation of smaller states like Vidarbha, Telangana and Bundelkhand.

However, these measures have not satisfied the pro-Vidarbha Congress leaders who met last November and demanded the setting up of a separate regional Congress committee for Vidarbha. Ranjit Deshmukh, who was at the forefront of the campaign for a separate Vidarbha state before he was appointed MPCC president, said he had not been invited to the meeting.
