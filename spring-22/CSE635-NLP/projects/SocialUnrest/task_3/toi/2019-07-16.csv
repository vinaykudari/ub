0,Vendors Cantonment board of flouting laws,"PUNE: The recently-installed railings around the Chhatrapati Shivaji market here to help curb traffic snarls and hawker menace have resulted in a fresh controversy.

The Machchi and Khatik Vyavasayik Sanghatana (MKVS), Pune, has accused the Pune Cantonment Board (PCB), which installed the railings, of violating the laws and bye-laws published in the Gazette of India, dated October 14, 1944, and thus encouraging vegetable vendors to set up stalls outside the market.

MKVS leader Abdul Rashid Karim said according to the provisions of the Cantonment market by-laws, hawking outside the market is strictly prohibited.

â€œBy setting up the railings, the PCB has committed a breach of trust. We have filed a civil suit against the board,â€� Karim said.

However, PCB chief executive officer (CEO) Jagdev Mahi refuted all the charges as baseless.

â€œWe have not violated any law. Instead, we have streamlined the traffic and disciplined the entire market area,â€� Mahi said.

However, the bye-laws published in the gazette restrict trading on only four roads in the area around the market, and at all places situated within 25 yards of any road crossing.

Mahi justified the PCB action saying the board had not entered into any written agreement with the hawkers. â€œIn fact, many authorised stall-owners themselves violate the law,â€� he said.

1,Master Mohanty irks ministers,"HYDERABAD: Serious discontent is brewing among the ministerial colleagues of chief minister Chandrababu Naidu over being evaluated by one IAS officer.

But ironically, they have taken their complaint about bureacratic interference to some senior IAS officers, to be conveyed to the chief minister.

Naidu has introduced a â€˜balanced score card approachâ€™ to appraise ministers and has asked them to submit a critical review of their own performance in a prescribed format every month.

P K Mohanty, ex-officio special secretary to the chief minister and executive director, Centre for Good Governance, has been entrusted with the task of evaluating these appraisals and submitting a report to Naidu every month.

The ministers, who have to go through the exercise of filling up a complicated self-appraisal form, are fretting and fuming at Mohanty, who drafted it.

The ministers are required to furnish details about routine review meetings, government programmes that are being given priority, cases pending with different investigating agencies, details of the files piled up with them, particulars of tours undertaken by the ministers and press meets and conferences addressed by them. The ministers are reportedly unhappy with the format.

One query relates to the speed with which the ministers clear the files and another question seeks to know whether the ministers were attending to public grievances.

The routine also includes details about inspections carried out by the ministers and prescribes at least four inspections in a month.

The ministers are miffed about having to provide minute details like office attendance, number of days worked, average hours worked and so on.

An angry senior minister told The Times of India that they were not school children to be evaluated in this manner.

â€œHow competent is the IAS officer to evaluate us in this way, he has no business to take up this exercise,â€™â€™ another senior minister from the Telangana region said.

A well-known minister said: â€œAn IAS officer is not empowered to gauge our performance and this format places us at the mercy of the bureaucracy.â€™â€™

The compulsory inspections prescribed in the format is forcing ministers to seek out places to visit. A senior minister travelled hundreds of kilometers recently just to unveil a statue and a few other ministers undertook long journeys to inaugurate buildings and offices in the district.

Some of them even attended birth anniversaries and other private programmes of some important personalities.

2,RS poll may alter state political map,"MUMBAI: Former state governor P.C. Alexander could well emerge as a rallying point for a realignment of political forces in the state.

Mr Alexander, who is contesting the lone Rajya Sabha seat from the state as an Independent candidate, is being supported by the Shiv Sena-BJP combine and the NCP.

Talking to TNN on Monday over the telephone, Sena chief Bal Thackeray initially dismissed the idea of a tie-up with the NCP. However, on further prodding, he said that his party had â€œcertain conditionsâ€™â€™ for the NCP.

â€œAlliances cannot be made in airy castles. The Sena has certain conditions for the NCP. If Mr Pawar accepts them, we can think it over,â€™â€™ he said, adding, in his characteristic style, â€œBut first, Mr Pawar should make up his mind. It often appears from his soundbytes that he is enamoured of the idea of cosying up to the Congress. He should come clean on this issue. Let him decide first. We shall see later.â€™â€™

Asked if the Sena had laid bare its conditions to the NCP in the last few days, Mr Thackeray replied in the negative.

â€œMr Alexander was the best governor Maharashtra ever had. The Sena thinks that he is the right choice for the Rajya Sabha. Mr Pawar too thinks similarly. We hold identical views on Mr Alexander,â€™â€™ Mr Thackeray said.

The speculation of a possible Sena-BJP-NCP alliance has gained ground in view of Mr Pawarâ€™s speech at the Kolhapur conclave of the NCP on Sunday, say political observers.

The NCP president dropped ample hints of a possible change in the countryâ€™s political scenario. â€˜Please donâ€™t draw hasty conclusions if the NCP, in the present era of coalition politics, feels compelled to team up with some other political forces,â€™ Mr Pawar is reported to have told his followers.

3,Cong protests Santan’s killing,"HYDERABAD: The shooting down of a criminal in the Governorpet police station by the police in the early hours of Saturday evoked strong protest from the Congress party, which described it as a cold blooded murder.The party has demanded a detailed probe into the encounter by the National Human Rights Commission to ascertain the facts. Speaking to reporters on Thursday, All India Congress Committee (AICC) secretary V Hanumanth Rao said the incident only reflected that the police had no respect for even the judiciary.While Kodeboyina Srinivasa Rao was to be produced in the court the next day, the police did not wait for that and killed him.The explanations they are giving after the incident are ridiculous, he said.Hanumanth Rao said that though the deceased was a rowdy-sheeter, it did not mean the police could kill him.If the police version to be believed and even if an attempt was being made on the life of the SI, the criminal should have been shot on the leg and not on the forehead from a close range, he pointed out.Rao alleged that chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu has given the police a licence to kill, as he aspires to win the elections with their help.Naidu will not mind even if the police go on a raping and killing spree. For instance, the recent incident of Kurnool counterfeit currency racket amply explains this, as the involved police officials were let off with an offer of VRS and no cases were booked against them, he said.Meanwhile, at a separate press conference, Congress chief official spokesman K Rosaiah took strong exceptions to the TDP criticising his letters to the chief ministers of different states asking them about the implementation of the food for work programme.We have in fact appreciated the Centre for extending liberal help to the state in critical times. But, at the same time, we also pointed out the largescale misuse of the food for work to fill the pockets of yellow shirts to the Central team which visited the state, he said.

4,Police trace source of hate mail instigating riots,"HYDERABAD: The city police say they now know where the hate mail threatening largescale bloodshed and violence in the city originated from. Early this month, many city residents had complained that they had received these scary e-mails. The messages were spine-chilling and threatened a bloodbath in Hyderabad, just like in Gujarat. â€œThese e-mails originated in Jeddah and Saudi Arabia. The source was a company called the Saudi Bin Laden Group. This firm is now out of business,â€� city police commissioner M V Krishna Rao told The Times of India on Sunday. A cable connection, and not a dialup network, was used to spit venom at the cityâ€™s hapless netizens. The messages bore the ID â€” sbg.com.sa and originated from a computer used by someone called Faiz-Ul-Haq. â€œHeâ€™s a faceless character, we donâ€™t even know if he exists. But his terminal was used,â€� Krishna Rao explained. Internet protocol can help investigators track the computer from where such objectionable mail is sent, but not the person, he explained. The city police got access to data stored in the computerâ€™s hard disk and are in possession of print-outs. The police chief said his men were working closely with the Jeddah police, cybercops and private companies on the case. The investigators found that the hate mail was spammed from Faiz-Ul-Haq of Jeddah, under the name of Kirpal Singh to S A Ansari, also a Jeddah resident. From there, it found its way to Hyderabadi Muslims living all over the world. The first Hyderabadi to receive the mail was Ghiasuddin. He lives in Riyadh. Deeply worried, he forwarded it to his relatives here, asking them if things were okay in Hyderabad, Krishna Rao said. The police subsequently got in touch with Ghiasuddin. â€œHe told us he was anxious to know if there was a communal flare-up in Hyderabad,â€� the police chief said. The hate mail was a mischief played to trigger communal tension here, he said. As more and more people kept getting such e-mails, some of them forwarded the mail to chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu with a request to take immediate action against those out to create trouble.

11,MLAs oppose loopholes in excise policy,"NEW DELHI: Irked with the Delhi state government for scrapping a provision in its earlier excise policy that the consent of the MLA had to be sought before opening a liquor vend in an Assembly segment, city legislators fought their case across party lines.

In the Assembly session on Tuesday, the Bharatiya Janata Party created a furore, terming the state government''s new excise policy as ""anti-social"".

While the BJP''s main grouse was the government''s decision to scrap the provision of seeking a no-objection certificate from MLAs before opening a liquor vend in their locality, they showed their dissent by taking an anti-liquor stance. BJP members staged a walk-out towards the end of the day''s proceedings.

The Congress MLAs, while supporting the liberalised excise policy, asked Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit to include the NOC provision in the new excise policy. The new excise policy came into effect on July 1.

As the treasury and the Opposition benches had a heated exchange on the pros and cons of easy sale of liquor in Delhi, Dikshit said that she was prepared to withdraw the policy if it had negative repercussions. ""If people are encouraged to drink more, we will be prepared to withdraw it,"" she said.

Initiating the discussion, leader of Opposition Jagdish Mukhi said that he would not allow a single private liquor vend to come up in his Assembly segment. ""Delhi is still not ready for liberalised liquor trade. The new policy will drive people to alcoholism,"" he said.

Congress member Arvinder Singh Lovely said that the Opposition was trying to paint an incorrect picture.

""The government cannot stop people from drinking, but it can ensure that they do not die after drinking spurious liquor,"" he said. Another Congress legislator Tarwinder Singh Marwah urged Dikshit not to do away with the NOC provision.

12,Vasundhara may become party leader in Rajasthan,"JAIPUR: With party patriarch Bhairon Singh Shekhawat likely to become the vice president, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is looking for a leader in the state who will not only provide leadership, but also steer the party to victory in the next assembly elections.

Ever since speculation about Mr Shekhawatâ€™s candidature for the post of vice president started making the rounds , hundreds of party workers have been thronging his official residence to greet him. But there is already talk about the partyâ€™s future as none among the senior leaders seems capable of providing effective leadership.

Mr Shekhawat first led the Jan Sangh and then the BJP. He played three innings as the chief minister of Rajasthan. None in the party matches his experience, and not just in his own party, but also in the Congress, he heads the popularity chart. Mr Shekhawat also enjoys a good rapport with the minority community and has a good following there.

Mr Shekhawat has chosen Union minister Vasundhara Raje, who is a member of the Lok Sabha from Jhalawar, as his political heir. Ms Vasundhara Raje is the daughter of late Vijayaraje Scindia and is married into the Dholpur royal family. It was Mr Shekhawat who roped the former socialite into state politics by making her contest the Vidhan Sabha election and then the Lok Sabha election from Jhalawar.

Ms Vasundhara Raje has hardly involved herself in the partyâ€™s organisational affairs, but as there are too many aspirants to take the mantle from him like national treasurer Ramdas Agarwal, state unit chief Bhanwar Lal Sharma, former deputy chief minister Hari Shankar Bhabhra, Lalit Kishor Chaturvedi, Raghubir Singh Kaushal and Ghanshyam Tiwari, Mr Shekhawatâ€™s gameplan seems to be to introduce a non-controversial figure, acceptable to all.

As Ms Vasundhara Raje belongs to the younger generation, Mr Shekhawat thinks she will inspire young party workers.

Barring party president Bhanwar Lal Sharma, all other senior leaders have been advocating a change in leadership. Mr Sharma, who is considered a Shekhawat loyalist, has hinted that he too would be willing to quit for a better person.

Mr Shekhawat believes that Ms Vasundhara Raje possesses the political acumen of her mother and is capable of rejuvenating the party with her leadership qualities. Having been a four-time member of the Lok Sabha, she has matured in terms of political understanding.

Most of Mr Shekhawatâ€™s detractors donâ€™t have much following. Being a fresh face will, therefore, be advantageous to Ms Vasundhara Raje . After initial hesitation, all senior leaders will eventually accept her, believes Mr Shekhawat. Moreover, her charm will win over people and she will be backed by the party leadership.
