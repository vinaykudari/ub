0,BMW seeks govt nod for 7-series launch,"NEW DELHI: German luxury car major BMW has shipped its 7-Series car â€” 745 â€” to the Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI) to obtain approval for launch.

The firm is planning introduce the 745 along with its entry-level 3-Series model 318i after the Union Budget in February 2004.

The 745, to be introduced as a fully-built imported unit, would sport a tag of around Rs 70 lakh. Its entry level model â€” the 318i â€” would be available at over Rs 20 lakh.

While the German car maker intends to make its debut through the direct import route and is in the process of establishing a retail presence in the market, officials said BMW was also actively pursuing plans to set up an assembly base in the country. As a first step, the firm will establish a sales subsidiary.

For the assembly unit, the firm is in talks with existing manufacturers to either lease out their spare capacity or set up a joint venture.

BMW had initially planned to enter India in a 50-50 joint venture with the Hero group to locally produce its 3 series and 5 series range of luxury cars. However, the proposal was rejected by the Indian government as the German major was not willing to invest the minimum amount of $50 million prescribed under the government''s MoU norms. BMW was willing to invest only $35 million.

In addition, BMW had set up a separate venture (also with a Hero group company) to assemble and sell top-end bikes in India. The bikes were initially introduced with a price tag of Rs 4.5 lakh, but abysmally low sales forced the company to trim the tag to Rs 1.8 lakh. However, this also failed to prop up sales.

1,Punjab govt give goahead for unbundling of PSEB,"CHANDIGARH: Punjab government on Monday approved the unbundling and corporatisation of the Punjab State Electricity Board (PSEB).

The decision was taken in a meeting of the empowered committee for accelerated power sector development presided by chief minister Amarinder Singh. The step had been mandated by the Electricity Act 2003.

PSEB would now be reorganised into a separate power generation company, atransmission company and three distribution companies.

A decision to create a holding company to coordinate the business of generation and distribution companies in the transition period was also taken in the meeting.

A holding company would be set up as a successor company of the PSEB in relation to all assets and liabilities and functions other than those of transmission. The generation and distribution companies would be subsidiaries of the holding company.

The holding company will have overall responsibility for coordinating and over seeing power generation through the proposed generating companies, procurement of power from Central power undertakings and other sources and distribution of power through distribution companies. The committee also finalised the configuration of the three distribution companies. The complete proposal will be brought before the cabinet shortly for approval.

The committee also gave PSEB the go ahead for the construction of 500 MW guru Hargobind thermal plant (Lehra Mohabbat stage II).

The Committee also asked the core group, comprising principal secretary finance, secretary power, chairman PSEB and managing director PIDB under the chairmanship of the chief secretary, to examine the funding of Shahpur Kandi hydel project at the earliest so that the full capacity of Ranjit Sagar dam could be harnessed.

3,This toothless tiger mauled 5 ministers!,"MUMBAI: With limited authority and manpower, Justice (retd) V.P. Tipnis, who steps down as the stateâ€™s seventh Lok Ayukta on Wednesday, had the distinction of indicting a record five state ministers for various misdeeds during his five-year tenure.

The ministers who faced the heat were Chhagan Bhujbal (when he was home minister), housing minister Syed Ahmed, minister of state for home Kripa Shankar Singh, minister of state for housing Nawab Malik and minister of state for water supply Sulekha Kumbhare. The Lok Ayukta has the powers to inquire and investigate a complaint involving a grievance or allegation against public servants, including ministers, bureaucrats and officials at the local self-government level.

This statutory body has powers to direct them to produce government files and documents. As many as 450 reports were filed by the Lok Ayuktaâ€™s office and another 225 special reports were submitted to the governor during Tipnisâ€™ tenure. However, the state legislature did not discuss a single annual report submitted by his office or that of his deputy, the Upa Lok Ayukta since 1999.

â€œThis office cannot be 100 per cent effective if there is no political will to implement its recommendations,â€™â€™ Justice Tipnis told TNN. He added that the one satisfaction he got was solving grievances of poor people who could not afford expensive litigation. More than 3,000 cases were taken up for proper investigations every year, achieving a success rate of 70 per cent.

Although often described as a toothless tiger as the Lok Ayuktaâ€™s findings and recommendations are not binding on the government, this is the first time in three decades that so many ministers have been pulled up and had strictures passed against them since this institution was established in 1972. In each of these cases, the Lok Ayuktaâ€™s office gave reasoned recommendations to the government as to how ministers should not misuse their positions and stop passing oral orders to their subordinates among other things.

Justice Tipnisâ€™ harshest recommendation was against Malik, whom he suggested be removed from the council of ministers for helping a builder despite a high court order in a case pertaining to the redevelopment of a chawl. The matter is currently pending in the supreme court. Justice P.B. Sawant, who has been appointed by the government to probe allegations made by social crusader Anna Hazare against four ministers, is also inquiring Malikâ€™s role in this case.

In another case, the Lok Ayukta warned Bhujbal, the then deputy chief minister, for reinstating a constable having a criminal background. Bhujbal had stated that he had initially rejected the reinstatement request because of the manâ€™s poor financial condition, but had cancelled his own order after learning about his background. However, the Lok Ayukta observed that Bhujbal changed his mind only after being told by the home department that it would be difficult for the government to defend the case if the matter went to court.

The Lok Ayukta said that the minister had also not given any reasons for reinstating the constable earlier. Later, the government instructed all ministers to give brief reasoning while passing administrative orders. In the case of Singh and Ahmed, Justice Tipnis pulled them up for preventing the demolition of illegal hutments at Santa Cruz despite a high court order.

He recommended that ministers should not issue oral instructions on the phone, but pass written orders on the file. In Kumbhareâ€™s case, she was found to have used her official letterhead to summon a person involved in a private dispute. Asked for an explanation, she stated that henceforth no official letterhead would be used in such cases.

4,Sena to play party-pooper,"PUNE: Shiv Sena activists in the city have threatened to disrupt New Yearâ€™s eve entertainment parties and programmes, if they extend beyond the 10 pm-deadline. But police commissioner A.N. Roy told TNN that nobody will be allowed to take law into their hands.

â€œAs it is, the government allows all restaurants and hotels to function beyond midnight even on normal days,â€� he said. The police will act strictly against violators of the law, he warned.

The Senaâ€™s city unit president and vice-president, Rambhau Parikh and Raghunath Kuchik, respectively, submitted a memorandum to Roy on Monday, urging the police to maintain a â€œstrict vigilâ€� on parties at hotels, bars, restaurants and resorts.

5,Wanna party safely? Hit home this year,"BANGALORE: The New Year chorus is getting louder, by the minute. The countdown for the year''s biggest blast has well and truly started. Come December 31 and the city is expected to go mad, dancing, drinking, feasting, partying and loading up for that one moment when 04 will push 03 into history.But not all of it is going to happen outdoors, at least not for the city''s security-conscious club-class dude.Though late-night parties, loaded with music, fun, food and dance, are very much a part of Bangalore''s New Year pop-cult, it is the drive back home from suburban or farmhouse party zones that is giving the dude a cold feet.Lonely roads aren''t the only dampeners. Hooligans lurking around ready to pounce on cars just to wish ''Happy New Year'', speeding vehicles, roadside brawls, nasty incidents and poor security for women are the other off-putters. ""I had planned to go to The Club for New Year eve with a big group of guys and girls but cancelled it a couple of days ago, fearing the security risks,"" says business analyst Nikhil Venkatesh. ""We will now be doing it at home, watching TV over a pizza or something better.""Nikhil is just one of the many who have changed their party plans. Says networking professional, Suresh Balraj: "" I decided to cancel my party plan mainly owing to safety reasons. Gone are the days where it was okay to return home after partying in Bangalore. Now with all the risks of street crimes, it''s just not worth it. I will be at home this New Year.""The twenty-somethings too are aware of the hazards but they are not changing their plans. The high of a swinging party is far too exciting to resist. So, while the middle-aged might keep off Bangalore''s hottest party spots, they will still sizzle this New Year night with the young bravehearts welcoming 04 amidst a sea of waving hands and shaking legs all washed over by a heady wave of music and drink. Sometimes, it feels really great to be young.",BANGALORE
6,Mamata threatens bandh in Jan,"KOLKATA: Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee on Sunday threatened to call a Bangla Bandh if the Left Front government did not withdraw the taxes imposed on all items from land to livestock. The Union minister without portfolio also levelled a more serious allegation against the CPM-led Front.

""They are trying to distract peopleâ€™s attention from the spiralling financial crisis by cooking up stories of illegal firearm hauls. These guns and bullets belonged to CPM goons and were used to murder or silence Trinamul Congress supporters before the 2001 Assembly elections,"" Banerjee thundered at a press conference in the city.

Chalking out her partyâ€™s strategy to take on the Left Front government in 2004, Mamata said the Trinamul would hold a series of rallies and street-corner meetings across the state from January 20. Hens, goats and oxen would be paraded in these rallies.

""They have started imposing taxes on hens, cows and bullock carts. One would have to pay tax even for riding a bicycle on a muddy road. This government cannot provide water or food to the people and yet it wants to impose tax on water. Next, this debt-ridden government will impose tax on the dead,"" she remarked.

""If this fails to get the desired result, we will call a 24-hour Bangla Bandh by January-end against the economically and morally bankrupt government,"" she added. She also criticised the government for its decision to allow the sale of alcoholic beverages in departmental stores. The party would observe a ""law violation"" day on January 9.

The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government, Banerjee said, ""now has a debt of over Rs 1,00,000 crore.

This means there is a debt burden of Rs 12,000 on every citizen of the state. And what does the government do to strengthen its coffers?

It wants to open new liquor shops everywhere and allow people to buy it from roadside stores. This is like asking a starving man to sell his mother as well,"" the Trinamul chief said.

8,Arrest warrants against Bhagalpur riot victims,"PATNA: The Bhagalpur riot victims are facing arrest. According to CPI state secretary Jalaluddin Ansari, around 800 to 900 victims of the infamous riot have arrest warrants issued against them for not repaying loans given to them under the rehabilitation package.

He said that after the riots in 1989, Rs 2 crore were distributed among the victims as loan as a part of the rehabilitation and relief package. He pointed out that most of the victims are from the weaver classes.

Ansari pointed out that after the 1984 riots, the Centre waived off Rs 8,000 crore given to the riot victims. ""Its a matter of shame and amazement that the Centre is initiating steps to recover loans to the tune of Rs 2.25 crore,"" he remarked. He said that the state government had given an assurance in the state legislative council that it would waive off the loans for the riot victims, and it was still pending before the assurance committee of the House.

He said that many of the beneficiaries of these loans were aged between 70 and 80 and were facing the prospect of going to jail. Calling the act as inhuman, Ansari called upon the state government to initiate steps to stop the recovery of the loans.

9,NCW asks Arwal SP to arrest Manju's killers,"PATNA: The visiting team of the National Commission for Women (NCW) directed the superintendent of police, Arwal to immediate arrest all the named accused of the killers of the All India Progressive Womenâ€™s Association (AIPWA) leader Manju Devi.

A four-member fact-finding team of the NCW before leaving for New Delhi on Monday said here the team will submit its report to the chief minister, Rabri Devi, and Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee for the implementation of its recommendation.

In response to The Times of India news item on the killings of women in Bihar, NCW team decided to visit the spot. One of the team members, Madhulika Singh, had inquired about the details of the incident from Delhi from The Times of India soon after the publication of news item.

Four NCW members â€” M L Majumdar, Shankar Sen, Nafisa Hussain and Madhulika Singh â€” during their two-day visit, visited the village Puran in Arwal district and talked to the villagers.

Manju Devi was allegedly killed by Ranvir Sena men on November 10. After the arrival of the team here on Saturday, it straightaway drove for the site of occurrence at Puran to make on-the-spot inquiry. The team interactedwith the family members of the deceased at her native village Dharnai and different political party leaders.

The team also summoned the district magistrate and superintendent of police, Arwal and inquired about the incident which led to the killing of Manju Devi. The team also met the two associates of Manju, Ashok Verma and Ram Awadhesh, in this connection. These two persons were moving alongwith Manju. Altogether 10 persons are the main accused.

Talking to a section of mediapersons, the team said, ""If the district administration fails to arrest the named accused at the earliest, we will also submit our report to the Union home secretary to put pressure to arrest the culprit"".

The Bihar unit secretary of Aipwa, Shashi Yadav, also submitted a memorandum to the visiting NCW team on Monday. Yadav, while talking to TNN, told the visiting NCW team that the local administration was not interested in arresting the culprit.

Aipwa, in its memorandum, said that the killing of Manju is a a result of Ranvir Sena people who are closely associated with RJD-Congress combine in Arwal district. She also alleged that a senior minister of the RJD government is directly involved in the killing of Manju Devi. Yadav said that Ranvir Sena activists have made the target of poor and Dalit women of Bihar. Citing incident, she said in Bathani Tola masscare, 16 women were killed while in Laxmanpur Bathe, 28 were killed.

Manju also contested as an ML candidate in the 2001 panchayat elections of Bihar. She was one of the 16-odd candidates in the Surajpur constituency of Jehanabad. She polled 4,240 votes, defeating her nearest rival Rina Devi, a Ranvir Sena candidate, by over 700 votes, Yadav said.

Manju had been active in CPI-ML since the 1980s, the period when the Brahmarshi Sena was active.

She was a leader of the organisation of women, agrarian labourers and rural poor, AIPWA. She had been active in the movement against ""feudal dominance"" and exploitation of women in Jehanabad and had led several movements against the ""police repression"" and ""feudal oppression"" in the region.

10,People’s govt changes hue with tax raj,"KOLKATA: Call it tax, service charge or mopping up excise earnings by issuing more liquor licence, the West Bengal government is desperate to widen its revenue net in trade and service sectors.

At long last, the ruling Marxists have realised that the government wonâ€™t survive only by giving ""relief to people"". Hence all commercial vehicles from rickshaws to matadors and trades like cattle-rearing and poultry are all being made taxable.

""The practice is already there in the villages. If a gram panchayat sets up a resting shed beside a crematorium, it would naturally realise the expenses from the villagers.

The rule holds for other services and trades as well, but not in the way Trinamul Congress leader Mamata Banerjee has been claiming, to whip up sentiments before the Lok Sabha polls,"" said state CPM secretary Anil Biswas on Monday.

Earlier, the party state secretariat had asked the CPMrun panchayats to identify the services and the income group capable of paying for these. The resource mobilisation bid is for obvious reasons â€” to garner funds for routine development work as the state has often failed to provide matching grants for Central projects.

The logic is the same for issuing more liquor licences. Biswas saw nothing wrong in the departmentâ€™s bid to augment revenue, when West Bengal was far behind states such as Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh.

""Illicit liquor shops have come up in many areas. Whatâ€™s the harm if the government brings them under the licence regime?"" quipped Biswas, despite the furore among Front partners. The government hopes to mop up Rs 66 crore this year by granting fresh liquor licences.

However, he rubbished the Trinamul charge that liquor outlets would soon outnumber grocery shops.

To Biswas, the proposed revision of property tax in Salt Lake and other municipalities was no increase at all. ""It is only a shifting from rentbased to value-based taxation as all cities do,"" he said.

According to municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya, this change was a condition laid by the Centre. ""Without this, we canâ€™t avail resources from the City Challenge Fund that the Union finance minister had announced in his budget,"" Bhattacharya said.

However, many citizens fear that the change would bring about an automatic increase in property tax. For this and the slew of service charges in the villages, the SUCI has planned to take to the streets.

Sensing the mood, Alimuddin Street has asked its district units to reach out to the people in a bid to ""dispel the confusion"".

11,Patna petrol dealers protest against murder,"PATNA: Petrol and diesel outlets here were closed for an indefinite period from Monday evening following the murder of Pramod Kumar Mishra, owner of three petrol stations, earlier in the day.

The criminals also looted Rs 10 lakh cash from Mishraâ€™s car. Mishra was on his way from his petrol station near Gandhi Maidan to a State Bank of India branch near the Maurya Hotel at the time of the incident. He was accompanied by his manager, Mohammad Yusuf, in the vehicle.

13,"Advani, Thackeray discuss early polls","MUMBAI: Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani on held a closed door meeting with Shiv Sena supremo Bal Thackeray to discuss the possibility of holding early Lok Sabha polls.

The duo met at the city Mayor''s bungalow at Shivaji Park in central Mumbai at 12.30 pm, Shiv Sena sources said adding, where Advani was likely to seek Thackeray''s opinion on advancing Lok Sabha polls.

Advani, who came here on Monday, was accompanied by BJP general secretary Pramod Mahajan, the sources said.

Earlier, Advani was scheduled to meet Thackeray at the latter''s residence but the venue was changed at the last minute.

BJP sources said Advani would hold preliminary talks with Thackeray on this issue and inform the outcome of their discussion at the party''s national executive meet in Hyderabad on January 11 and 12.

BJP has made up its mind to advance the General Elections following the party''s spectacular victory in three states in the recent assembly polls, the sources said, adding, ""it (the BJP) is seeking the response of its allies now.""

""A favourable monsoon, BJP''s success in recent assembly polls, image of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, NDA''s ability to provide a stable government and to surprise the opposition are some of the factors favouring early polls,"" the sources said.

14,Early LS polls after consultations: Advani,"MUMBAI: Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani on Tuesday said early Lok Sabha elections will be good for the NDA.

However, he added that a final decision on it will be taken after due consultations with all the constituents of the coalition.

Replying to a question whether there was not much of a challenge to the NDA, Advani said: ""The general assessment is that NDA can reasonably be confident of renewing its mandate for five years.""

On questions whether any efforts would be made to bring back DMK and MDMK which have withdrawn from the NDA and pulled out their ministers from the Cabinet, he said: ""They are not practically in the NDA right now.""

Pointing out that the developments were ""expected"", he said this has come in the backdrop of the DMK severing its ties with the BJP in Tamil Nadu some time back and the death of its prominent minister (Murasoli Maran), who had contributed a lot to the relationship.

The Deputy Prime Minister said that no decision has been taken about early elections and it would be taken after consultations with the allies.

15,"For BJP, all signs point to early general polls","NEW DELHI: On Tuesday, the possibility of early general elections â€” end April, early May 2004 â€” increased. A second key NDA ally, the Shiv Sena â€” and the third largest party in the coalition â€” told Deputy PM L K Advani that it was agree-able to advancing the poll dates.

Earlier, Andhra Pradesh chief minister N.Chandrababu Naidu, who heads the TDPâ€” the second largest party in the NDA â€” had told the Prime Minister on his recent visit to the Capital that he was keen to hold assembly elections in his state along with the general elections in the first few months of the year.

On Tuesday, Chief Election Commissioner JM Lyngdoh told a TV channel that it was possible to advance the dates of the polls.

NDA sources said the BJP leadership wanted to consult all its NDA partners on the timing of the polls so that a final view could be taken at the BJPâ€™s forthcoming national executive meeting in Hyderabad on January 11/12.

If the consensus is for an early poll, the PM may well advise dissolution of Parliament around the middle of January. BJP president M Venkaiah Naidu has already directed BJP state units to prepare two action plans â€” one for elections due in 125 days and another in 250 days.

Meanwhile, NDA convener George Fernandes, sources said, has been asked to speak to the other allies, which include his new party, the JD-U, formed recently after the merger of the Samata Party and the JD-U.

The others are the Biju Janata Dal, the Trinamul Congress, the Indian National Lok Dal and the Akali Dal. The Akalis, too, are reportedly keen on advancing the poll dates both because it has been at the receiving end of chief minister Amarinder Singhâ€™s â€˜â€˜clean Punjabâ€™â€™ campaign and also because the ruling Congress in Punjab is a divided house.
