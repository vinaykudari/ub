0,PM may not attend summit on development,"NEW DELHI: With US president George Bush and several other leaders slated to stay home, Prime Minister Vajpayee, too, may not attend the World Summit on Sustainable Development starting August 26 in South Africa.

""Whether the outcome will be worth a head of government going has not yet been decided,'''' external affairs ministry official Deepa Wadhwa said on Thursday at a two-day South Asian Journalists Workshop on Global Environmental Negotiations, organised by the Centre for Science and Environment. Environment minister TR Baalu would, however, be going.

The official disappointment with the run-up to WSSD was clear on Thursday, when Wadhwa and Union environment secretary PV Jayakrishnan spoke at the workshop. There is nothing concrete to report other than disagreements. Fundamental issues of time-bound commitments, concrete means of implementation and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities - the latter an acknowledgement of unequal situations and relations between countries - have not been resolved. Each review, say ""realistic"" officials, just ends up with developing countries losing more ground.

In 1972, Indira Gandhi was the only head of government to attend the Stockholm conference. In Rio de Janeiro, 10 years ago, 109 heads of government/state were present. This time, that ""high"" is missing.

More than 90 heads of state or government will be in Johannesburg. The Africans will be there, the Europeans, addressing their local constituencies, will be there. So will quite a few Latin American heads, possibly out of the nostalgia for Rio.

But Egypt, Malaysia, the SAARC region heads are unlikely to make it. ""Whether the process deserves the same status as we gave Rio is very much open,"" said Wadhwa.

But Emil Salim, former Indonesian environment minister and chair of the preparatory meetings to WSSD, tried to sound optimistic, suggesting that Bush, bogged down in domestic compulsions, might drop by Johannesburg after Labour Day on September 2. The summit ends on September 4.

But American ""stonewalling"" during the preparatory process has left little room for optimism. For the developing countries, the bottom line is resources, technology transfer and capacity building. Instead, the Europeans have been trying to forge links between trade and social issues while the Americans tried to focus on good governance within developing countries, shying away from international governance and commitment issues.

In this context, countries like India are also worried about the concept of ""partnership initiatives"", between governments, the private sector or citizen groups. Without a framework, they see this concept as an attempt to expand the business and civil society domain at the cost of formal governance structures, diverting resources to business channels which will not address the poverty alleviation and social agenda. Partnerships, says one official, should be nationally-driven to be useful. Otherwise, they may bring in neither resources nor technology.

1,Vigilance misled us on Zaffarwal's arrest: SAD,"CHANDIGARH: The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) has blamed Vigilance Bureau chief director AP Pandey for â€˜â€˜misleadingâ€� both chief minister Amarinder Singh and former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal in the case of Wassan Singh Zaffarwalâ€™s arrest.

Senior SAD leaders, Balwinder Singh Bhunder and Gurdev Badal, in a statement here on Thursday alleged that Pandey had adopted a contradictory stance on the matter.

Last year, as IG (Border Range) Pandey, had taken pride in the fact that he had arrested Zaffarwal.

But now, he was trying to prove that Zaffarwalâ€™s arrest, had in fact been a case of surrender involving former SAD minister Sucha Singh Langah, they added.

The two leaders said, â€˜â€˜Pandey has a lot to answer for keeping Badal in the dark and now presenting the same case to Amarinder in a different formâ€™â€™.

They added, â€˜â€˜With what face and conscience could he (Pandey) blame not only Langah but also Badal for hatching a plan for Zaffarwalâ€™s surrender, when only a year ago, he almost got himself recommended for a gallantry award for arresting Zaffarwalâ€™â€™.

The man, put in the helm of the so-called anti-corruption campaign with such fanfare, has exhibited how he could alter his stance opportunistically to suit his political interests, they added.

2,Power struggle in BJP crippling govt: Ravi,"PUNE: Congress general secretary Vayalar Ravi on Thursday fired a salvo against the A.B. Vajpayee government, claiming that the â€œpower struggleâ€� between Prime Minister Vajpayee and his deputy L.K. Advani has seriously affected the functioning of the Union government.

Ravi, who made his first trip to Pune after being appointed as the partyâ€™s observer and in-charge of intra-party affairs in Maharashtra, was accorded a grand reception and felicitation at the Congress Bhavan here by city unit chief Mohan Joshi.

Addressing a crowded meeting of party workers, he said that the on-going power struggle between Vajpayee and Advani has not ended though the latter has been appointed as the deputy prime minister.

This, he said, has adversely affected the functioning of the Union government which has failed to redress the issues concerning common people. He alleged that around 60 lakh tonnes of rice was lying in Food Corporation of India (FCI) godowns and that was not being distributed to the poor and needy. Claiming that this would not have happened during the Congress regime, he recalled that the Congress had implemented the garibi hatao programmes.

â€œIn fact, BJP leader Pramod Mahajan openly says that his government is not for the poor people, but for the wealthy class,â€� he said.

The power struggle between the two top BJP leaders has also prevented the government from protecting the interests of the minority communities, he said. He also said that the relief camps in Gujarat were on the verge of closure.

Rajya Sabha member Suresh Kalmadi and his opponents in the party, minister of state Balsaheb Shivarkar and Ulhas Pawar, were present on the dais. In an oblique reference to the faction feud in the Congress city unit, Ravi said: â€œThough in our party units too there are differences between some leaders, they all believe and accept the leadership of one person, Sonia Gandhi.â€�

While this may be true, the factionalism in the Pune Congress unit once again surfaced during Raviâ€™s felicitation function. In a massive show of strength, supporters of corporators Deepak Mankar and Datta Sagre and supporters of Congressmen Ramdas Marne and Sanjay Balgude indulged in slogan-shouting, which continued for nearly one hour. So much so, that even while Ravi was being felicitated by Joshi and Kalmadi, slogans were raised praise of Mankar, Marne, Balgude and Sagre! State Congress chief Govindrao Adik was agitated by the chaos that he had to tell party workers that he would halt the function sloganeering was not stopped.

â€œVayalar Ravi has come the city for the first time. He will carry a very bad impression about the city if you indulge in such acts,â€� he said, following which the sloganshouting stopped.

3,Divestment policy draws criticism,"NEW DELHI: The Opposition mounted a concerted onslaught on the government in the Lok Sabha on Thursday for the way in which it was disinvesting its PSUs.

The criticism ranged from the non-transparent manner in which several profit-making PSUs were being sold at throwaway prices to that the governmentâ€™s stated objective of selling PSUs to put money into the social sector etc was not being observed.

PR Dasmunshi (Congress) wanted to know why the governmentâ€™s only defence was the Congress which had initiated it. He pointed out that his party had â€˜â€˜never stood for divestment of profit-making PSUsâ€™â€™.

Questioning the governmentâ€™s decision to move oil from the core to the non-core sector and then start selling oil PSUs, he said he objected on two grounds â€” one, oil was intimately linked to the security interests of the country and two, the profits of the oil PSUs had gone up from about Rs 30 crore in the 80s to Rs 24,000 crore currently. Oil should therefore be returned to the core list, along with defence and atomic energy, where disinvestment was not allowed.

4,Absenteeism rules the roost in Govt offices,"KANPUR: Have these inspection changed the working style of the employees of Kanpur Nagar Nigam and its associated office? No, in fact these inspections hardly had an impact on the erring workers. Reason: They are aware that the first resident of the city lacks power to punish them.

Most of the KNN employees, especially the women staff are still following the same old routine of arriving late at the office and spending time in gossiping.

The inspections by mayor Anil Sharma and Commissioner Rajaram and the stringent action recommended against employees for laxity have failed to deter the staff. In fact the KNN authorities never implemented the recommendations due to the fear of strike and agitation.

â€�We donâ€™t want to give them a chance to go on warpath. They are least bothered about the work. They would love to agitate against our actionâ€�, said a senior KNN official.

The Mayawati government recently issued a govern ment order asking officials to ensure presence of employees during the morning rush hours in all departments.

The principal secretary housing has also issued directives in this regard to ensure that the grievances of common man are solved on the spot.

Following the directives, the Commissioner and other senior officials have carried out surprise inspections in departments, including Kanpur Nagar Nigam, Jal Sansthan and Kanpur Development Authorities (KDA) within the last fortnight.

Commissioner Rajaram carried out a surprise visit of Kanpur Nagar Nigam on July 16 and claimed to had found every thing in order.

Meanwhile, the KNN authorities are in a dilemma over the action have sought explanation from the erring official. Mayor Anil Sharma told Times News Network â€œI want to ensure the presence of officials in the nagar nigam ... but I am helpless as I cannot take action against the erring workers .... I am trying my level best to improve the civic facilities in city.â€�

5,BARC scientist commits suicide in Trombay,"MUMBAI: A scientist from the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre reportedly committed suicide on Thursday morning by jumping from his third floor flat in Kamet building, Anushakti Nagar, in Trombay.

The scientist, Amrish Bose (44), was suffering from depression for several years, the police said. He is survived by his wife and a 13-year-old son.

â€œHe has not left behind any suicide note.

But inquiries with family members revealed that Mr Bose had suffered a head injury following an accident in 1986.

Following this he had bouts of depression for which he was undergoing treatment.

Last month he met with another accident following which his mental condition became worse,â€™â€™ a police officer stated.

The suicide has shocked residents of Anushakti Nagar, which has witnessed two suicides in the last two years.

6,Bend rules like RTO does,"LUCKNOW: Over the past few days, road mishaps seem to have increased manifold in the city. In most of the cases, it is seen that city buses and maxicabs violate traffic rules with impunity, which result in accidents. Often it is seen that drivers get away easily after committing accidents. All this in turn points to instances of unsavoury goings-on in the Regional Transport office (RTO) in the city.

In order to get a first hand experience, this writer chose to spend time at the RTO near the Amausi airport. The machinations of wheelers and dealers that one encountered in the RTO precincts raises a serious question mark on the future safety of not only fellow motorists, but pedestrians too.

The unofficial rule number one in the RTO office seems to be: Grease my palm, get your work done. Naturally, such an environment breeds corruption. For starters, if you apply for a licence, you need to submit the application form with the help of touts roaming outside the entrance gate of the RTO. And, if you somehow try to submit the application form on your own, chances are that it will be rejected on more than one ground. However, if the touts sitting outside the RTO office scribble some illegible letters on your application form, you are likely to get a learnerâ€™s licence in double quick time.

Moreover, the touts have a solution in hand for everything. For instance, if you are not able to come, you could still pass the test. They also take care of medical fitness certificate and the crucial driving test. Their â€˜drivingâ€™ logic is simple: the more incompetent you are, the more you pay to be officially competent. Furthermore, commercial vehicles are required to be given a certificate of fitness from time to time. Yet, during the official once-over of such vehicles, a glimpse of the vehicle is enough for a new fitness certificate.

As regards other â€˜trivialâ€™ official matters like checking the working of brakes and lights, something which is seldom done, a normal â€˜unofficial paymentâ€™ is adequate. Rates of such payments are fixed and seldom is there any scope for bargaining.

On being apprised of these goings-on, RTO, AK Pandey, while talking to Times News Network said, â€œI am not ruling out the possibility of many of my clerks and officials being hand in glove with these middlemen (touts)â€�. He added: â€œThis is not our fault, as the people themselves choose to contact these middlemen to get their work done, because they do not have the patience. They prefer to part with money, rather than spend a few hours for the sake of getting a licenceâ€�.

7,Jharkhand economy hit by domicile unrest,"RANCHI: The premises of two stone crushers at Balsiring village in Tupudana near Ranchi wore a deserted look two days after a group of 100-150 youths supporting the Jharkhand governmentâ€™s domicile policy set one of the crushers on fire and damaged the other.

The arson and violence on July 28 were a sequel to the violence during the July 24 bandh in support of the domicile policy in which at least five people were killed in and around Ranchi.

The grievance of the local residents of the nearby villages was that the crusher owners, Ran Vijay Singh and Chandrawati Devi, belonged to Bihar and that they employed daily-wage workers mostly from Chapra and Siwan while denying employment to them. At least 20-25 stone crushers are located in Balsiring.

Panic-stricken workers now refuse to come to work, said Andheria Oraon, munshi at Singhâ€™s crusher.

The situation at the two violence-hit stone crushers almost surmises the economic fallout of the unrest in the state on the domicile issue. The insider-outsider agitation has not only hit the economy but has also proved to be a major stumbling block in the proposed industrialisation of this mineral-rich region. In undivided Bihar, the then chief minister Laloo Prasad Yadav was accused of failing to provide infrastructure leading to the closure of several medium and small-scale industries, said K K Poddar, president of the Jharkhand Chamber of Commerce and Industries, adding that the Babulal Marandi government, which promised to provide better environment and facilities, has done precious little.

Electricity still remains an expensive commodity and financial institutions are yet to stabilise. With the domicile issue taking the worst possible turn, the clock has been turned back at least by 10 years, said Sanjay Seth, owner of a small-scale industry.

In the three industrial areas in and around Ranchi â€” Kokar, Namkum and Tupudana â€” all units remained closed from July 23 to 28, causing a production loss of more than Rs 50 crore. In Deoghar district, Jasidih was a major industrial area where at least 50 small-scale units operated. All the units were declared sick and remain closed.

8,PMC strike called off as govt agrees to lift ESMA,"PATNA: The 22-day-old strike of the Patna Municipal Corporation employees ended on Thursday following an agreement between the strikers and the state government in presence of RJD supremo Laloo Prasad and chief minister Rabri Devi.

The government has agreed to revoke the punitive steps taken against striking PMC employees under the provisions of ESMA with immediate effect.

According to the agreement, the government will pay the salary dues of the striking employees before August 10. The employees have not been paid their salary for the last eight months. It has also been decided that the PMC will spend 80 per cent of the total revenue collected by way of taxes for making payment of salary and pension to the employees. This is aimed at regularising the payment of salary to the employees.

The government has also agreed to clear the 1996 bonus dues of the employees before Durga Puja. The government also agreed to implement all the points of agreement reached between the striking employees and the authorities at their meeting held on July 9 and 10, 2001.

The government has also accepted the demand of striking employees to categorise the money to be provided to the PMC under the heads of â€œloanâ€� and â€œgrantâ€�. The finance department will direct different government departments to clear their current holding tax within a week. According to the leaders of PMCâ€™s â€œSamyukta Sangharsh Samitiâ€�, the RJD chief directed the DGP and Patna DM, to immediately complete the formalities for the withdrawal of cases.

10,BJP demands simultaneous polls in Gujarat,"NEW DELHI: Claiming that the law and order situation in Gujarat was ""more conducive for elections"" than Jammu and Kashmir, the BJP on Friday demanded simultaneous polls to the state Assembly along with the latter.

""We welcome the Election Commission''s announcement of the poll schedule for Jammu and Kashmir. When elections are due in more than one state assembly, they go to polls together so that results of a state do not influence the other. Therefore, elections to the Gujarat Assembly, too, should be held simultaneously,"" BJP parliamentary party spokesman Vijay Kumar Malhotra told reporters here.

He said that the situation in Gujarat was ""more conducive for polls"" than Jammu and Kashmir, where over four lakh people were displaced.

""Encounters are a daily feature in Kashmir. The whole state is terrorism-affected while in Gujarat, the Panchayat and civic polls were held peacefully and the number of refugees are far less compared to Jammu and Kashmir,"" he said.

Malhotra said that special polling stations can be set up for the people staying in relief camps in Gujarat besides the facility of postal ballots can also be made available as has been done for Kashmiri Pandit migrants.

Condemning the ""double-standards"" of the Congress and the ""secular brigade"", he asked them to take the issues to the ""people''s court"" and seek a popular verdict.

12,One more arrested in rath yatra case,"AHMEDABAD: The crime branch took into custody another person in the rath yatra arms case. The accused, Farukh Khan alias Farukh Bidi, was arrested by the local branch of Nadiad and is the 13 arrested for planning an attack on the rath yatra.

According to the police, the accused was a working in a moulding factory in Nadiad and lost his job after the mill closed down. Subsequently, he came in contact with a scrap dealer, one Gheban Shah Dargah in Gazipura of Nadiad. The person, popularly know as Gani, also knew Shabbir, the prime accused in the rath yatra arms haul case.

Gani, along with another aide, Victor, took Farukh to Shabbir and introduced him as a master craftsman on the lathe. Farukh was introduced to the job of carving out gun muzzles. He was subsequently appointed in a lathe machine factory in Sarkhej near Jai Hind Hotel for production of .12 bore rifles. He was being paid Rs 300 per day for his skills.

On Thursday the crime branch brought Farukh to the city on a seven day-transit remand from Nadiad. Police informed the court that Farukh during preliminary questioning has confessed that he had manufactured the long iron-muzzles that were fitted on to the rifles seized from accused Shabbir who is absconding.

13,Modi wants hike in crude oil royalty before elections,"GANDHINAGAR: Chief Minister Narendra Modi, wanting to go for early polls, wants Prime Minister AB Vajpayee and Union petroleum minister Ram Naik to urgently implement the Mauskar Committee report recommending a steep hike in crude oil royalty to Gujarat.

The chief minister insisted during his Tuesday meeting in New Delhi that he wanted ''an early solution'' to the problem in view of the forthcoming polls to the state assembly. However, so far there has been no confirmation whether the prime minister or the petroleum minister will oblige.

The tangled issue pending with the Centre since 1993 was clinched a month ago when the Mauskar Committee agreed to change the formula for giving crude oil royalty. It accepted the Government of India notification of 1997 that mooted the principle of pricing indigenously produced crude oil on the international import price parity basis. Currently, the state is entitled to an ad hoc payment of Rs 850 per metric tonne, with the Central petroleum ministry arbitrarily fixing the crude oil price at $16 per barrel.

""Gujarat wants international import price parity, which is $25 right now"", said CM''s economic adviser SK Shelat. ""With the Mauskar Committee report out, the Union petroleum ministry and the finance ministry should put the matter up before the Union Cabinet after clearing all finer details. Currently, Gujarat gets a royalty of Rs 500 crore per year. If it is revised on the international parity basis, royalty would go up to Rs 900 crore immediately, with incomes rising each passing year"".

If this current international price parity is translated into royalty to Gujarat, it would be Rs 1,200 per metric tonne. ""Under the formula worked out in 1997, accepted by the Mauskar Committee, the state should get the import parity price on a sliding scale. Starting with five per cent of the price rise, each year the royalty amount would increase and reach to cent per cent in five years"", Shelat said.

A Rs 400 crore rise in the state''s income at a time when the danger of drought is looming large over a large number of Gujarat districts is considered crucial from the electoral viewpoint.

""Another issue the state wants to be solved urgently is implementation of the new exploration licensing policy to Gujarat''s advantage"", Shelat told TNN. ""Introduced three years ago to attract MNCs and other big players, it is meant to exploit crude oil and gas reserves at unexploited on-shore and off-shore blocks in the gulfs of Khambhat and Kutch regions. We want the state to have a bigger share in profit -sharing than hitherto has been the case. We are ready to enter into contract with MNCs for this"".

Presently, 90 per cent of government share in profits accruing from exploration goes to the Centre. With the state''s participation, the government wants its profit-sharing to reach 50 per cent. For this, the Oilfield Development Act would need to be amended. ""Pending before the Union Cabinet, the same principle can be applied to coal-based methane fields whose reserves are aplenty in Mehsana, Banaskantha and Ahmedabad"", Shelat said. ""These reserves can produce nearly 4,000 MW of extra power for the state"".

14,Dharavi cabbies protest police ‘harassment’,"MUMBAI: On Thursday, a large number of taxi drivers of Dharavi staged a demonstration, in front of the Dharavi police station, to protest against the harassment and high-handed behaviour of the policemen attached to the Dharavi police station.

The taxi drivers alleged that the police unnecessarily pick- up the drivers, who park their taxis on the 90 feet road, at night and charge them under the Bombay Police Act. They collect Rs 1,200 fine from the drivers. Those who fail to pay the deposit are kept in police lock-up.

After the demonstration, general secretary of the Bombay Taximenâ€™s Union, A.L. Quadros met Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP) of Kurla division, Deepak Gajul. Later, the police asked the union to form a local committee of taxi drivers of Dharavi, which would meet the police inspector of Dharavi police station, once every month to address the grievances of the taxi drivers.

15,Contract plan for college teachers draws protests,"MUMBAI: The newly-introduced contract system for degree college teachers has provoked protests from academicians. Six members of the Mumbai universityâ€™s management council raised protests at a meeting on Thursday.

The meeting discussed the government resolution detailing the manner in which the recruitments will be conducted. Under the system, contract teachers will be paid much lower salaries than those of permanent teachers. â€œWe said at the meeting that itâ€™s highly retrograde,â€™â€™ said a management council member. â€œThe government is not funding higher education at all.â€™â€™

The system is discriminatory, said members of the statutory body. Professors on contract will earn Rs 16,000, which is what lower placed regular lecturers will be paid under the fifth pay commission scales, a member said.

Management council members also discussed the reports prepared by university committees on admission malpractices in city colleges. The report was referred back to the committees for more details, vice- chancellor B.L. Mungekar said. The university was supposed to decide on the penalties to be imposed on the colleges for admission irregularities at Thursdayâ€™s meeting.

Meanwhile, the National Studentsâ€™ Union of India organised a demonstration at the Fort campus, urging the management council to take action against the authorities of the Burhani College of Commerce and Arts, Mazgaon. A university committee had indicted the principal and vice-principal for irregularities in its report. The management council ratified the university report on Thursday. The university will be writing to the management to take action against the principal, a management council member said.

16,SC gave police guidelines on arrest cases,"MUMBAI: The arrest of housing society chairperson S. A. Varma (name changed) after an 18-year-old accidentally fell to his death from the terrace of their building raises questions about the functioning of police stations.

As this case shows, policemen are ignorant about the laws and guidelines related to arrest. But, aware of the misuse of the power to arrest, the supreme court had laid down clear guidelines for this in the Joginder Kumar case of 1994. In this landmark judgment, the apex court had ruled that except in cases of heinous crimes, arrests should be made only if there is reasonable justification.

Mr Varma was arrested on June 30 on charges of criminal negligence under section 304 (A) of the Indian Penal Code. There was absolutely no justification to arrest Mr Varma as the police commissioner himself realised on scrutinising the case later.

The facts of the case, as learnt on investigation, show that the 18-year-old fell off the building after he sat too close to the edge of the terrace wall. Besides, he was a trespasser.

Lawyers say Mr Varmaâ€™s arrest was unwarranted as there was no criminal intent on his part. In any case, they point out, he was unlikely to abscond. The Goregaon police could have left the decision for an arrest to the magistrate and merely taken a bond from Mr Varma to remain present in court on the day the case was chargesheeted.

The decision to arrest Mr Varma was taken by the officer in charge of Goregaon police station, Ramesh Keny, himself. There have been two other cases of unjustified arrests of law-abiding citizens where the officers in charge of police stations were directly responsible.

The Varma case also shows the arrogance of the police. A host of law-abiding citizens argued on Mr Varmaâ€™s behalf but the Goregaon police not only went ahead with the arrest but also wanted to take his fingerprints. In fact, Sub-inspector Manohar Awhad, who effected the arrest, made it seem that he was doing a major favour to Mr Varma by letting him go on a bail bond and not locking him up.

It is precisely with such instances in mind that the supreme court had ruled in the Joginder Singh case that no arrest can be made just because it is lawful for the police officer to do so. â€œThe existence of the power to arrest is one thing. The justification for the exercise of it is quite another.. Arrest and detention of a person can cause incalculable harm to his or her reputation and self- esteem...â€™â€™

The mistake made by Mr Keny went unnoticed by assistant commissioner of police Shankar Puri, who, as the supervisory officer, is supposed to go through all arrests in police stations every day.

The case was reported in this newspaper at length but notice was taken of it only when Mr Varma and other office-bearers in his housing society met police commissioner M.N. Singh last week.

The officers concerned in this case can face disciplinary action such as a showcause notice or a departmental inquiry depending upon the view taken by his superiors. However, police sources say that officers are seldom penalised for unjustified arrests.
