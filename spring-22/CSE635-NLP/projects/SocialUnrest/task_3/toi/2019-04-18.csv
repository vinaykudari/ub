1,Left demands probe into Gujarat riots,"hyderabad: the nine leftist parties on wednesday reiterated their demand for sacking gujarat chief minister narendra modi and ordering a high-level inquiry into the communal violence in gujarat. the leaders of nine leftist parties â€” the communist party of india-marxist (cpi-m), communist party of india (cpi), mcpi, suci and others â€” were speaking at a meeting held after taking out a rally from charminar to mahatma gandhi bus station, imlibun. a press release by the city committee of cpi(m) criticised the rastriya swayamsevak sangh (rss), vishwa hindu parishad (vhp) and bajrang dal for unleashing violence against the minority community in the name of godhra massacre. the burning down of kar sevaks in sabarmati express is a crime to be condemnable, but the gujarat government led by modi instead of taking steps to punish the culprits behind the massacre was â€œindirectly leading the mob from frontâ€�, leaders who spoke alleged. modiâ€™s statement of â€œcommunal violence being a reaction of godhra massacreâ€� shows that he is supporting the communal carnage unleashed by the sangh parivar, they said.they alleged that the bjp after facing defeats in the recently held elections in uttar pradesh and other states was again dragging the ayodhya into forefront with the help of rss. cpi state secretary b v raghavulu, cpi state joint secretary k narayana, cpi-new democracy leader suresh and other leaders of nine leftist parties spoke on the occasion.

3,"No compensation, no elections, warn riot victims","ahmedabad: naynaji fatwaji marwari of the relief camp in a municipal school of kankaria is unable to submit to the fate that rioters have accorded him. he can also not accept the bjpâ€™s new-found desire to seek a fresh mandate during such troubled times. today, if there is one issue that binds the 75,000 riot victims, housed in 53 different relief camps across the city, it is the want for peace to return to gujarat before any sort of elections are held. the riot victims of both communities are unanimous on one issue â€” narendra modi may be looking for a fresh mandate, but they are not prepared to exercise their franchise. even the now overtly-evident administrative strategy in coaxing the victims to go back home, the likes of marwari are less than impressed. â€˜â€˜we are victims of dirty politics. now if you tell me to vote for the same leaders who have let us down, then my answer is no, neither the bjp nor the congress,â€™â€™ said marwari, while talking about how his house was burnt down by marauding rioters, who he believes were instigated by politicians. marwari used to stay in the wadiwas locality of the shah-e-alam area before being ousted by the riots. he asked: â€˜â€˜without rebuilding our burnt-down homes, without telling us how we would earn our living, they expect us to cast our vote in their favour? they now give us a paltry sum of rs 15,000 when rs 50,000 was promised by the prime minister himself for rebuilding our homes. this inconsistency between the promises made and the compensation given is keeping us from returning home.â€™â€™ disillusionment with the democratic structure is equally strong in the shah-e-alam roza camp, where even on monday, the riot victims continued to flow in even as the bjp went into its poll mode. â€˜â€˜the camp is brimming to capacity and our requests to set up a similar camp close by has not yet been approved by the state government. even the number of dead has not been arrived at and only seven of the 131 families in our camp who lost their near ones have been compensated,â€™â€™ lamented chief coordinator of the camp mohsin qadri. he added: â€˜â€˜but these issues are falling by the wayside as just a couple of days ago, the authorities from gandhinagar began putting pressure on us to force these victims to return home, even if it is in an area like naroda-patia, where 85 persons were burnt alive. they have even promised to give 35 kg of foodgrains to each family ready to go back. but there are no takers.â€™â€™

4,"Fearing EC, Modi keeps polls on hold","ahmedabad: the perception that the election commission in new delhi would not allow assembly elections in gujarat at this juncture forced the gujarat cabinet to skip the issue of dissolution of the state assembly at its meeting here on wednesday. sources said that the friends of chief minister narendra modi in new delhi had got indications about the reluctance of the election commission through informal channels and advised him to stay put on the matter for the time being. these powerful friends of modi are now exploring ways and means through which the election commission could be convinced that the setting was not inappropriate in gujarat for holding elections. i.k. jadeja, cabinet spokesman, told reporters after the cabinet meeting: â€˜â€˜the issue was not discussed. the bjp central leadership has asked the cm to take a decision at an appropriate time. he will do that when it is necessary.â€™â€™ â€˜â€˜in any case, cabinet meetings are just a mere formality. modi can call for a meeting whenever he wants and take a decision on the poll,â€™â€™ said an insider. he added: â€˜â€˜in modi raj, only he decides everything in the cabinet.â€™â€™ bjp sources, however, agreed that from their point of view, early june was the ideal time for holding the elections. â€˜â€˜the iron would have been hot and we would get a substantial benefit at the hustings. but beyond that time, the influence would wane,â€™â€™ said the bjp sources. the most obvious way that the ec in new delhi would get convinced that there is no harm in holding elections if peace is established in gujarat. this is what modi proposes to try and do now, confided sources close to him. but that is more easily said than done, they conceded. â€˜â€˜the genie is out of the bottle. it is not so simple to put it back,â€™â€™ said an analyst. nevertheless, modi is planning to ensure that high school examinations, beginning thursday, are held in an orderly way to prove that all is well in ahmedabad and the state. he also plans to hold peace rallies and padyatras in the city for that purpose. the vhp is obviously not averse to helping modi in this endeavour. significantly, ahmedabad went without any trouble on wednesday, even though two vhp workers were killed in communal attacks on tuesday. in normal circumstances, the city would have been expected to burn. analysts conceded that elements inimical to modi would have a vested interest in keeping up the violence in the next few days with a view to discrediting him. interestingly, jadeja said that the cabinet had taken a â€˜â€˜very serious view of complaints received from various quarters that inmates of the relief camps are causing troubleâ€™â€™. jadeja added: â€˜â€˜the cm has ordered an inquiry into this.â€™â€™ the minister was unable to specify what the actual complaints were and who had filed them.

5,Interministerial panel report on FDI by May,"new delhi: an interministerial committee on fdi is likely to submit its report next month suggesting measures to simplify multiple clearances and revamping the structure of foreign investment promotion board to boost fdi. the committee, being chaired by the industry secretary v govindrajan, is examining all existing procedures for investment approvals and implementation of projects. official sources said the committee would suggest measures to simplify and expedite the process for both public and private investment. ""the main objective of the committee would be to hasten the process of clearance as also to improve the quality of the fdi flows,"" they said. cumulative fdi since 1991 has been around $74.29 billion of which actual fdi inflows has been a mere $27.98 billion, an average realisation rate of around 40 per cent. sources pointed out that with expansion of the automatic route since february 2000, actual inflows under this route have been taken on the approval side. however, since inflows are normally made in a phased manner, the initial investment figure does not capture the total level of investment intent thereby understating the fdi approved. in order to correct this anomaly the industry ministry has asked the reserve bank of india to collect the complete data giving the total level of investment intended and not the amount in a particular year, they said.
