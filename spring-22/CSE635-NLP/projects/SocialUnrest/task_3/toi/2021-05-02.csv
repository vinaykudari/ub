0,Can the assembly polls be made ballot-proof?,"MUMBAI: After last Monday''s poll fiasco, when thousands of Mumbaikars had discovered to their dismay that their names weremissing from the electoral lists, Prahlad Kakkar bumped into a tax official at a party.

Quipped the ad man, ""So, now that I don''t exist, I don''t suppose I need pay my taxes any more.""

Kakkar is one of those who took the monumental mess-up with a sliver of humour. Othersâ€”celebs and commoners alikeâ€”are still fuming.

While some (actress Kunika Lall and a bevy of Page 3 supporters) have formed a forum that will ""sue"" the Election Commission, others like Shobhaa De are also ""exploring legal action"".

At a more practical level, citizens'' organisations and political parties have swung into action to rule out a replay in the assembly elections this September. ""We''ll make sure we''re well prepared,"" says an activist.

WHODUNNIT?

But first, what really went wrong on that murky Monday? Inquiries are under way at various levelsâ€”the two city collectors, the election department and the Election Commission of Indiaâ€”and it''s too early to point a decisive finger in any one direction.

However, there are a couple of indicators.

One school of thought attributes some of the damage to the computer (this was the first time the electoral rolls were fully computerised).

While the work of registering the names is done by enumerators requisitioned by the election department, data entry and integration of the rolls was outsourced to an IT company, which, in turn, is believed to have sub-contracted part of it to other parties.

At the ground level, some of the blame has to be shared by the election department, its protestations notwithstanding.

Since elections theoretically come once in five years, the department has only about 80 full-timers, and most of the work is carried out by staff requisitioned from other government departments. Some of the mistakes could have originated from here.

SO, HOW MANY COMPLAINED?

Polling stations received about 13,000 oral complaints, not all of which are traceable. The state election department has received two complaints, one each from BJP candidate Kirit Somaiyya and Congress candidate Gurudas Kamat, and even these, say EC officials, don''t give too many particulars about the phenomenon of missing voters.

Among celebrities, only a few like Prahlad Kakkar and Pooja Bedi actually mentioned that they''d filled up Form 6, which is meant to rectify the registration errorâ€”many others weren''t even aware of the existence of such a document.

HOW TO RECTIFY THE MISTAKES

BJP members have met chief electoral officer R K Bhargava with complaints and suggestions, and plan to be more vigilant about their voter base in the assembly polls.

""We have put up banners and hoardings asking people to ensure their names figure on the rolls. Now, from May 20, we''ll step up the campaign,"" says city BJP general secretary Atul Bhatkalkar.

The NCP plans to distribute 3.5 lakh application forms to city voters before the September rolls are closed. ""Our cadres will go door to door and ensure that those whose names were omitted register themselves,"" says NCP leader Gurunath Kulkarni.

Shiv Sena spokesperson Subhash Desai says the party has already instructed local workers to find missing voters and get them registered.

""We''ll start this process around May 15, since registration begins on May 20,"" he says. The Sena has suggested that the EC hold camps in different areas, so that people can go and register.

NGO Agni, which has been working to raise voter awareness for years, says it is getting its ward coordinators and joint area action groups to ensure that the technicalities of the voting process get across to all.

""We have to inform people that a voter ID card is not enough,"" says Agni convenor Gerson D''Cunha. ""They have to go check the voter list, and if their name is not there, fill up Form 6, and take it to the EC''s office with proof of residence. We''re hoping to collect enough money to put out advertisements on this.""

OTHER SOLUTIONS

Although the election department had actually set up a helpline in each assembly segment about ten days ahead of the polls, and had three touch-screen kiosks installed in the city to guide voters, most were unaware of this facilityâ€”as they were about the helpline set up by the department.

Voter awareness programmes, thus, should be a priority for the EC.

Simplifying the procedure for registering names would help. ""If you shift your home, for instance, you''re asked to delete your name from the old place of residence and get a certificate. Only on production of that certificate will your new address be registered. This puts off people,"" says Bhatkalkar.

""Now that the rolls are fully computerised, one should be allowed to simply give an application. The EC can do the rest.""

The EC needs to think up creative solutions to sorting out the confusion in the electoral rolls. In the 1999 polls, the Thane collectorate resolved the problem of duplication of names in Navi Mumbai by sending mail to the different addresses available on record for each such voter and recording only that address from which a reply was received.

""Physical verification would have been impossible,"" says an official involved with the exercise.

Finally, smart cards for voters and a call centre may be the best options. A pilot project for smart cards as a form of identification has been commissioned by the Union government in 13 talukas of the country.

Says professor of IT at IIT-Powai Deepak B Phatak, ""At the moment, the cards will be expensiveâ€”about Rs 150 if they are to incorporate stringent security features."" He expects the price to fall in about four years, though.

""So, if we start working out its components and implementation details now, we''ll be swiping our IDs in the next Lok Sabha elections,"" he says.

""Tall claims of the NDA to provide corruption free government has proved hollow.... In fact, even coffins of soldiers were on sale in the NDA regime,"" she told an election rally here in favour of party candidate Sukhbans Kaur Bhinder from Gurdaspur Lok Sabha seat.

The BJP, which promised employment to one crore youth, did nothing for the unemployed, Sonia said.

The Congress president said the NDA government was ""opportunist and narrow minded"".

She claimed all sections of the society, specially women and Dalits, were unhappy with the policies of the BJP-led government.

Promising to provide ""maximum rights"" to women, Sonia, in her brief address, assured that Congress, if voted to power, would work for rebuilding the country.
