0,Traffic rules turn commuters unruly,"KANPUR: Squabble between traffic policemen and commuters are not an uncommon sight in Kanpur. Be it a busy chauraha or a railway crossing, commuters can be often be seen raising their eye brows at traffic policemen when they are chided to follow rules and regulations. The reason for this is not far to seek either. The city traffic police is for the first time implementing traffic rules and regulations for the first time in right earnest. Commuters earlier did not bother with knowing let alone following any of these traffic norms. More than a couple of cases of altercations between newly-vigilant traffic personnel and never-to-be-bothered commuters have been reported in recent days.

Such traffic tussles unfortunately though not uncommonly acquire tones of a prestige issue. In one such instance a commuter when he was caught red-handed on charges of violation of rules tried to throw his weight around by brandishing powerful connections with higher officials. However, when the policeman refused to pay heed to this, the arguments turned into an all out brawl. The fact of the matter is that commuters, especially those on two-wheelers have been unable to digest the new implementation of traffic rules which shackle their often time wayward activities on the road. Something they are definitely used to getting away with.

For the first time in a long time, the traffic police is implementing rules with strictness in the city. In fact, the difference this time is palpable as they refuse to take any excuses from individuals or organisations. The district administration is set in its determination to put an end to traffic chaos. Besides, the administration has identified four busy routes which would soon be declared one-way routes.

City commuters are greatly annoyed with the new rope system where policemen try to contain traffic within set limits using ropes at Zebra crossings. All this is a deliberate design to teach commuters where to stop at crossings. When caught on the wrong foot or wheel as it were commuters are asked to reverse or maybe even pay a penalty.

DIG Kanpur range R R Bhatnagar has stressed on the need to implement traffic rules strictly in Kanpur in order to streamline traffic. He adds that it is the moral responsibility of all on the road to follow the rules. The DIG is of the view that people should be aware of traffic rules at a time when the traffic police is making efforts at stricter implementation of these to better control traffic. The DIG also admits that people on the road lack patience and are always in a hurry to get some place.

The scene at railway crossings is a grim reminder of this need to get ahead as it were. At any such closed crossing long queues of vehicles collect on both sides of the road (crossing over to the wrong side of the road) thus effectively not allowing any movement of vehicles. It is almost a line-up for battle in an adversarial stance as vehicles on one side of the crossing line up across both sides of the road as do vehicles on the other side of the crossing, allowing for little or no movement.

1,UP trucks and buses stranded at Bihar border,"LUCKNOW: Rows of trucks and buses from UP loaded with supplies were lined bumper to bumper on the Bihar border with the Bihar Transporters Federation strike entering into fifth day. Protesting against the raise in road tax, commercial traffic in Bihar has come to a grinding halt since August 1.

The main routes connecting UP to Bihar are GT Road, Gorakhpur-Kushinagar, Ballia and other adjoining districts. Sardar Swaran Singh, president the UP Truck Owners Association, emphasised that private truckers were too scared to enter Bihar for fear of antagonising the strikers, which could lead to violence resulting in a loss of goods worth crores of rupees. Traders of perishable goods are particularly worried as their supplies of vegetables and fruits are left rotting with no means to send them into Bihar. However, Mondayâ€™s developments show that there may still be hope for reconciliation with auto-ricksha drivers and mini buses calling off strike in Patna. Singh said that those stranded in Bihar were, for the time being, forced to remain there until issues were resolved.

Kishan Singh Atoria, Commissioner UP Transport, said: â€œBecause of our quarterly and monthly taxation schemes, which have already been collected, the state revenue was not affected by the strike. Also, a reciprocal agreement with Bihar is being worked out and a meeting in this regard has already taken place. Until an agreement is in place, this is not within our purview.â€�

However, trouble may already be brewing in UP with the UP Truck Owners Association demanding that the prices of the â€˜Golden tokenâ€™ be rationalised. According to this monthly scheme, the government used to charge Rs 2000 from buses coming into UP and Rs 1500 from vehicles operating within UP. With effect from August 1, this has been raised to double the amount, Rs 4000 for the former and Rs 3000 for the latter. Singh said this was completely unreasonable and the association would resort to strike and â€˜chakkajamâ€™ if their demands were not met soon. He alleged that this was an undemocratic method adopted by the government to extort more money from hapless truck drivers.

2,Baudha’s arrest stayed,"LUCKNOW: The high court here, on Monday, while staying the arrest of Dr Rajuma Baudha, chairman of Avadh Institute of Dental College, Dewa Road, Chinhat, until further orders, issued notice to Anurag Saxena, a student of second year in the aforesaid dental college.

The orders were passed by a division bench, comprising Justice UK Dhaon and Justice PK Chatterjee, on a writ petition filed by Dr Rajuma Baudha, challenging the validity of the first information report (FIR) lodged at police station Chinhat under section 406, 419, 420 and 506 IPC against Dr Rajuma, his son Richema Baudh and three others by the students of his dental college, Anurag Saxena and 51 others.

Senior advocate Virenda Bhatia, arguing on behalf of the petitioner, submitted that Dr Rajuma was the chairman of a reputed college affiliated to Dr Ram Manohar Lohia Avadh University, Faizabad, and the allegations made in the FIR, including the enhancement of fee, were vague and made with ulterior motive to tarnish the image of the institution. He added that the petitioner had never cheated and committed any breach of trust.

In the FIR, it is alleged that the accused persons had illegally realised 15 per cent increased fee from the students, got admitted on free seats of Rs 10,200 and on payment seats of Rs 20,250, and the students who had failed to pay the same were not permitted to sit for examination. It was further alleged that the accused had also charged fee for second year illegally even without getting recognition and even the receipts were not given to students.

3,Police clear screening of film on Gujarat riots,"MUMBAI: Secular groups won a belated victory on Monday when the police admitted that there was nothing objectionable in the two films against communalism which they had seized before they could be screened at DAV College, Kanjur Marg, on July 19.

The films, by Gauhar Raza, were about to be shown to the students when a posse of policemen barged in and picked up the activists who had organised the screening.

While one of the films, â€˜Evil stalks the landâ€™, is about the Gujarat carnage and interviews of those in the refugee camps in Ahmedabad , the other film, â€˜In Dark Timesâ€™, shows the parallels between philosopy of the Nazis and that of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS).

At that time, zonal deputy police commissioner Dhananjay Kamlakar had defended his decision, saying that the screening could create communal tension.

Activists of the pro-BJP Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), had complained to the police about it. On Monday, Mr Kamlakar said â€œWe have found nothing objectionable in the films.â€™â€™

â€œThe earlier argument of the police that the screening would have led to a law and order problem was specious,â€™â€™ said lawyer Mihir Desai of the India Centre for Human Rights. Secular activists point out that on July 13, policemen succumbed to pressure from the ABVP and prevented the National Convention on Peace and Secularism from displaying an exhibition of posters on Gujarat made by students from the J.J. College of Arts.

In fact, the police had even prevented the poster exhibition from being shown in colleges.

The exhibition, by the Satyashodhak Vidyarthi Sanghatana, had been inaugurated by Mumbai university vice-chancellor Bhalchandra Mungekar. â€œWe were even summoned by the Special Branch-I of the Mumbai police,â€™â€™ said Sumedh Dalvi of the Sanghatana,who finally had to appeal to deputy chief minister Chhagan Bhujbal.

The police permitted the exhibition to be held after Mr Bhujbalâ€™s intervention.

â€œShould the police allow itself to be blackmailed by those threatening violence or should it protect the democratic rights of citizens?â€™â€™ asked Irfan Engineer of the Centre for the Study of Society and Secularism. He was referring to the right to freedom of expression, the right to information and the right to peaceful protest.

â€œWe are particularly concerned that these attempts at muzzling the secular voice are happening in a Congress-ruled state while publications like Saamna continue to spread hate propaganda without restraint,â€™â€™ says a letter written by Insaaniyat, a secular group, to Congress president Sonia Gandhi, chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh and others.

It has also urged police commissioner M.N. Singh to train his men so that â€œcustodians of law and order can differentiate between propaganda inciting hate and divisiveness and voices of sanity advocating peace and harmonyâ€™â€™.

Saying that the Sangh Parivar does not represent the Hindu majority voice, Insaaniyat has demanded that the state restore the constitutional rights of citizens opposed to the Sangh Parivar.

4,"Teachers, parents protest board exam for Std IV","MUMBAI: Parents and teachers are rallying to make the state government reconsider its resolution introducing board exams for standard IV students.

Across the city, Parent Teachersâ€™ Associations (PTA) are organising meetings to protest the government resolution, while the PTA United Forumâ€”an association of PTAs in city schoolsâ€”is planning a meeting of 120 school representatives later this week to chalk out its strategy.

The Forum has already launched a signature campaign in schools.

In Bandraâ€™s St. Stanislaus school, parents braved the pouring rain on Sunday to attend a meeting to discuss the government resolution.

School PTA secretary Sandra Patel said that parents were made aware of the contents of the circular and its impact.â€œ

We talked about the absurdity of such a circular being framed without taking parentsâ€™ or teachers into confidence,â€™â€™ Ms Patel said. She added that the board exams would burden students.

These exams are to be held in addition to the annual school exam. Exams will be held in three subjectsâ€”social sciences, maths and general knowledge.

The tests will be spread over one day and students who top these exams will be given scholarships. Parents are upset that the resolution was issued only on July 15, after the academic year started, leaving them no time even to prepare students for what is in store.

Arundhati Chavan, president of the PTA United Forum, said that the exams would â€œtake away the studentsâ€™ childhoodâ€™â€™. Her organisation had been in the forefront of an agitation against the government decision to increase fees in aided English-medium schools.

â€œWe feel that these exams will overburden the child,â€™â€™ Ms Chavan said. Students will have to appear for the board exam in February and then take another annual exam in March or April.

Though the syllabus for both the tests is the same, it would put children under tremendous pressure, she added.

The Parent Teachersâ€™ Association of Canossa school at Mahim held a meeting recently to discuss the exam issue, while at Shailendra Education Society, parents launched a signature campaign against the move, said principal M.L. Phansekar.

5,Bus owners seek insurance cover for bandh damages,"KOLKATA: Caught between the pressure from the government to operate buses on bandh days and possibility of buses being damaged if they do so, bus owners are planning to approach insurance companies, asking them to offer risk coverage which will include damage suffered on a bandh day. â€œCurrently, the insurance companies do not offer compensation for damage suffered on a bandh day. It is their policy that in case a bandh is declared in advance, then the risk solely is that of the owners,â€� said joint council of bus syndicate president Sadhan Das. The government buses did not face such problems, he added. â€œThe government agencies do not bother abo-ut damage as it comes from the state exchequer. But individual bus owners will have to foot the bill themselves. Even if a bus suffers a normal accident on a bandh day, there will be no compensation. In such cases, no owner will be interested in operating buses.â€� He claimed police were of little help when it comes to protecting buses from damages. â€œPolicemen scold us for operating on a bandh day. They will not issue a proper report which is ne-eded for claiming compensation from insurance companies. And if the insuran-ce company finds that the accident took place on a bandh day, they will not issue any compensation either,â€� he said. Only the state government could help, Das felt. â€œIf the government provi-des any assurance of damage coverage, more owners will be encouraged to operate buses on bandh days,â€� he said. However, the governme-nt itself is not confident offering security on a bandh day, he alleged. There were handful of private buses on the roads during Mondayâ€™s bandh though state government buses were plying on the streets. Business in Burrah Bazar and Posta areas remained closed throughout the day. Operations in the Calcutta Stock Exchange also came to a standstill. Wholesale markets like Mano-hardas Katra, Bagree market, Nadram market, Pugia Patti and textile market remained closed.

6,House stalled over Oppn demand for Dutt’s arrest,"MUMBAI: The state legislature had to be adjourned on Monday with the proceedings being dominated by the controversy over film star Sanjay Duttâ€™s alleged conversations with gangster Chhota Shakeel.

The legislative assembly was adjourned thrice while the council had to be adjourned twice when members raised the issue and demanded Duttâ€™s arrest.

The Mumbai police had recently submitted tapes to the court of a special judge here in connection with the Bharat Shah case.

The tapes allegedly contained telephone conversations between the Karachi-based Chhota Shakeel and some Bollywood personalities, especially Dutt, in November 2000.

Senior BJP leader Gopinath Munde told the legislative assembly on Monday that he had not released Dutt in 1997.

As deputy chief minister in the erstwhile Shiv Sena-BJP government between 1995 and 1999, Mr Munde had held the home portfolio. â€œSanjay Dutt was released by the Tada court,â€™â€™ he stated in reply to deputy chief minister Chhagan Bhujbalâ€™s remark that Mr Munde had ordered the release of the actor.

Raising the matter during zero hour, Mr Munde said the telephone tape had raised serious questions about the law and order situation in the state.

Mr Munde was backed by leader of the opposition Narayan Rane, who said that the state government owed a lengthy explanation to the house.

Reluctant to take up the notice for adjournment motion, speaker Arun Gujarathi insisted on going ahead with the dayâ€™s agenda,which included a clutch of calling-attention motions and a debate on the drought situation in the state.

The speakerâ€™s reluctance angered the Sena-BJP legislators.

The discussion then turned into a legal wrangle between Congress member Janardan Chandurkar, who is close to Duttâ€™s father, Sunil Dutt, and Sena-BJP leaders.

Raising a point of order, Mr Chandurkar said the house could not take up the issue as the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) court judge had ruled against any such public discussion and its coverage by the media.

â€œThe house is supreme and sovereign to discuss any issue,â€™â€™ Mr Munde retorted. â€œThe MCOCA courtâ€™s ruling cannot affect the assembly,â€™â€™ Mr Rane added. Mr Chandurkar insisted on referring to Kaul and Shakdher, a learned tome on parliamentary procedural rules.

Mr Bhujbal then remarked that Dutt had been released in 1997 at the behest of Mr Munde.

This led to the third adjournment. Earlier, the Sena-BJP combine mercilessly grilled minister of state for home Manikrao Thakre on a spate of questions.

Mr Gujarathi succumbed to strident pressure from the opposition and witheld a question, a ruling which, according to legislative conventions, amounts to pulling up the minister for lack of preparedness.

7,Naxals trying to weaken govt: CPM,"KOLKATA: Even as the Naxalite Peopleâ€™s War group sets fresh terms for talks with the West Bengal government, the CPM on Monday mounted a scathing attack against the Naxalites, describing them as a force whose main objective was to weaken the Left movement in the country. In a statement on Sunday, the PW had said that it was willing to talk to the state government provided police action against PW activists were stopped and all police and paramilitary forces were withdrawn from the areas of struggle. In a major climbdown from its earlier demand of disarming the CPM, the PW also asked for unconditional release of all political prisoners and judicial probe into the cases of police firing and atrocities in the state. CPM state secretary Anil Biswas however sternly advised the PW on Monday to give up violence and said that the ultra-Left group was working against the Left movement. Speaking at the birth anniversary of Muzaffar Ahmed, a pioneer in communist movement in the country, Biswas, strangely, chose the PW as his target of attack. Bangla bandh, called by the Trinamul Congress, did not figure even once in his speech. â€œThis ultra Left group is hardly active in states like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Then why have they chosen West Bengal ? It is only because they want to disturb the Left Front government in this state,â€� Biswas said. â€œThey simply want to spread panic through their line of individual annihilation,â€� Biswas said.

8,CM withdraws confidential appraisal system for govt employees,"KOLKATA: West Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjeeâ€™s ambitious efforts at improving work culture in state government offices turned a cropper on Monday as the all-powerful Coordination Committee of Government Employees forced him to backtrack on the proposal to introduce a confidential performance appraisal system. Bhattacharjee had earlier informed the state Assembly that the government planned to change the evaluation process from an open to a confidential format to enforce discipline and efficiency among the employees. Coordination committee general secretary Smarajit Roychoudhury said Bhattacharjee had agreed to persist with the present system at a meeting on Monday afternoon. â€œWe want the appraisal to be done in a transparent manner. The annual confidential report was done away with after the Left Front came to power in 1977 and should not be re-introduced,â€� he said. In the ACR format, Bhattacharjee had proposed individual files for each employees which would contain remarks on his/her performance during the year. employee concerned would, however, not have access to the file. During appraisal, employees would assess themselves and have the rating vetted by superiors. This would, however, be done confidentially with the individual files playing a crucial part in the process. While dismissing the proposed system as anti-employee, Roychoudury said even the present system was not perfect as work directory and attendance reports were not being inspected properly during the time of appraisal. â€œWe have sought for a marksheet format where marks will be allotted under different heads like attendance, performance, integrity, responsibility and efficiency. A cut-off marks at 60 per cent will be set for being eligible for promotion,â€� he said. â€œHowever, once employees cross the threshold, seniority should be the only criteria in deciding promotions,â€� Roychoudhury demanded. What this effectively means that even if a junior employee scores more than a senior, the latter will get the nod for promotion. It is not known whether Bhattacharjee has agreed to this clause but if he does, it would mean cowering down to pressure and doing away with performance-linked rewards. Apart from Bhattacharjee, senior cabinet colleagues who were present at the meeting included Suryakanta Mishra, Nirupam Sen and Asim Dasgupta. The coordination committee also urged the chief minister to bring the recruitment of district employees under the Public Service Commissionâ€™s umbrella. â€œNow that there is parity in pay among the employees in the city and the districts, we feel that the recruitment process should also be uniform,â€� Roychoudhury explained. To allow candidates from the districts to compete in the examinations, he proposed zone wise division like that done by the school and bank service commissions.

9,ML gears up for Nov 25 party meet,"PATNA: The CPI-ML (Liberation) has made elaborate arrangements to make its five-day seventh all-India party Congress a grand success. The party has decided to hold the Congress for the first time in Patna, is scheduled to begin here at the Bharatiya Nritya Kala Mandir from November 25.

The final agenda paper of the congress would be decided in a forthcoming central committee meeting to be held at Vijaywada in the second week of this month.

Partyâ€™s state secretary Ram Jatan Sharma said, party Congress is held usually after a gap of five years. The last Congress was held at Varanasi in 1997 in which a sum of Rs 10 lakh were spent. During the underground period, two congresses were held in the interiors of Khamara village in Giridih (now in Jharkhand) and Gaya districts (1976 and 1982).

After the party came overground during early 1990s, it organised its first open Congress at Kolkata in 1992. Eight CC members belong to Bihar, while there are 39 members in it. Members from Bihar are Nand Kishore Prasad, Ram Jatan Sharma, Pawan Sharma, K D Yadav, Ram Naresh Ram, Saroj Chaube, Amar and Ramji Roy.

The Patna Congress is being considered significant because of the countryâ€™s changing political scenario. Besides discussing organisational agenda in the meeting, the party will also chalk out a political agenda for the next five years, Sharma said.

Sharma, a resident of Amarpura village in Jehanabad has served Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Jharkhand as state party incharge during his 27-year old career in the party.

10,Collector beats up protesting students in Kurnool,"KURNOOL: District collector G Sai Prasad on Monday beat up several students who were holding a dharna in front of the district collectorate demanding repairs to their school building. The students, most of them aged 8-12, squatted at the main gate of the collectorate to protest peacefully under the banner of Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP).

The collector, who was proceeding to attend a Chaduvula Panduga programme, stopped his vehicle at the gate and and summoned two ABVP leaders to his vehicle and asked them to leave the place. The collectorâ€™s vehicle made as if to move on but suddenly stopped. The collector then got out and ran back to the agitators with a stick. He started beating the leaders, Sampath and Madduleti.

He even turned his ire on onlookers and asked his guard to join him in the beating. Meanwhile, a police Quick Response team arrived there and at the orders of the collector arrested both the ABVP leaders. The collector also turned his anger on the 100 or so students who were still picketing the gate. Shouting at them to leave, he pushed some of them away. The children ran away helter-skelter and some of them fell down due to the chaos.

The collectorâ€™s action sparked protest statements by some political parties. CPI district secretary K Jagannadham, CPM district secretary T Shadrak demanded that action be taken against Prasad.

Speaking to reporters, they alleged that the collector acted like a goon by beating and kicking students. â€œIf bringing studnets to agitate is not right, why is the administration doing so for every programme like Janmabhoomi, Neeru-Meeru, Clean and Green and Chaduvula Panduga,â€� they asked.

The leaders demanded an unconditional apology from collector Sai Prasad and sought the release of the arrested student leaders.

Speaking to TNN, the collector said he had only wanted to check the exploitation of innocent students by political parties for their political ends. He clarified that he did not beat up any student, but had only brandished a stick at them. â€œI wanted to send a message to all the students organisations not to bring small students to agitations,â€� he said.

12,Visakha IT park gets govt nod,"VISAKHAPATNAM: The state government has cleared a proposal for an Information Technology (IT) park to be set up adjacent to the Visakhapatnam Urban Development Authority (Vuda) office complex in Siripuram.

The IT park, costing about Rs 30-35 crore would acquire 2 lakh sq ft space for housing IT shopping, software parks as well as training institutes, according to Vuda vice chairman S G K Kishore. The AP Industrial and Infrastructure Corporation (APIIC), L&T Info and Vuda will float a joint venture company for taking up the project, he added.

A joint meeting with the three partners would soon be held to work out modalities like fixing of land cost, equity among other things. Vuda would offer its two-acre land located in prime area of Siripuram in the city as its share. ""We don''t want to just offer our land for the project.

We want to be part of the development,"" Kishore told reporters on Monday. Asked whether there was a demand for such a park in the city, Kishore, quoting a survey done by L&T Info, suggested that IT projects in Vizag would have a good future. The proposed submarine cable from Malaysia would pass through Visakhapatnam coast, which would be a major advantage for the IT projects in and around the city, he said.

Kishore said the JV by APIIC, Vuda and L&T Info will also be planning for an IT village on the Vizag-Bheemili beach road in the near future. The IT village, proposed in about 100 acres surrounding Rishikonda, would be taken up in the next phase, Kishore said.

14,Bharti makes all incoming calls free in Gujarat,"NEW DELHI: Bhartiâ€™s AirTel has become the first company to make all mobile to mobile incoming calls free for its Gujarat customers, irrespective of the company a caller subscribes to.

AirTel subscribers, however, will have to pay Rs 75 a month for this facility, which will soon make mobile-mobile incoming calls a nation-wide phenomenon.

The company made this announcement on Monday while launching cellular services in Gujarat. Within a couple of weeks, this industry-wide initiative, as reported by The Times of India on Monday, is expected to be extended to all mobile subscribers throughout the country. Last month, AirTel and Hutch made incoming calls free for their respective customers, first as part of alternative package, then across the states they operate in.

Now, this move will apply across networks, throughout the country. This means that an AirTel subscriber wonâ€™t pay for incoming call from a Hutch, or BPL or Idea customer anywhere in the country.

With Gujarat, meanwhile, Bharti has completed the launch of all its new projects, a process that began in December â€” AirTel mobile services in nine circles, Touchtel basic phone services in four circles and Telesonicâ€™s national and international long distance (STD/ISD) services.

â€˜â€˜With the Gujarat launch, we have completed a big round of launches and now we will concentrate on operations and services,â€™â€™ said Bharti Enterprises CMD Sunil Mittal. Bharti has decided to increase, within six months of operations, its investments in UP (West) by Rs 30 crore. The total investment in the circle will rise to Rs 130 crore.

15,Centre committed to holding free J&K polls: PM,"NEW DELHI: The Centre was committed to holding free and fair elections in Jammu and Kashmir and was providing all assistance to the Election Commission in this regard, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee said on Tuesday.

He gave the assurance to a Congress delegation, led by leader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Manmohan Singh, when it called on him in Parliament House.

Vajpayee said that enough security forces had been despatched to the state and more were being sent to ensure free and fair polls without violence, according to official sources.

The Congress leaders had expressed doubts over holding of free and fair elections in the state.

Replying to questions on imposition of Governor''s rule in the state before the four-phased polling, Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani, who was present at the meeting, told reporters that it was a subject matter for the state government to decide.

Manmohan Singh said that the delegation also demanded that election under ""credible"" administration was needed to inspire confidence of the public so that there was maximum possible participation in the electoral process.

Besides Vajpayee and Advani, the others present were Finance Minister Jaswant Singh, Defence Minister George Fernandes and National Security Advisor Brajesh Mishra.

The Congress side was represented by Pranab Mukherjee, Arjun Singh and Ambika Soni.

16,Gujarat revenue minister resigns,"AHMEDABAD: Gujarat Revenue Minister Haren Pandya has resigned from the Narendra Modi ministry in Gujarat following a show-cause notice issued to him by the party recently about his alleged deposition before a citizen''s tribunal which probed the riots.

Pandya, however, clarified that he would remain in the BJP.

Pandya told Times News Network at 3 pm that he was proceeding to meet Modi with his resignation and that ""there is no question of withdrawing my resignation"".

Indirectly hinting at Modi, who was supposedly behind the show-cause notice issued to the minister, Pandya said ""I do not want the party to suffer because of the whims of a particular individual"".

Pandya was issued the show-cause by state BJP president Rajendrasinh Rana in connection with a remark made by a member of the tribunal, which was headed by Justice (retd) Krishna Iyer.

The member had claimed that ""a Gujarat minister"" had deposed before the tribunal stating that the government had given clear directive to the police officials at a meeting on February 27, on the day the Godhra massacre took place, that the police should not interfere with the reprisals.

Though Pandya had explained his position to the BJP president, he had made reply to the show-cause notice public stating that it was wrong on part of the president to have made the notice public in the first place.

He had denied that he ever deposed before the tribunal and said that he was not even present at the meeting where these directions were allegedly given to the police.

Pandya, a supporter of former chief minister Keshubhai Patel, had incurred Modi''s wrath because of his refusal to vacate the Ellisbridge Assembly seat in Ahmedabad to enable Modi to enter the Assembly through a by-election.

Modi then preferred the Rajkot-2 Assembly seat from where he eventually got elected in mid-February.

Signs of the souring relations between Pandya and Modi were evident in recent weeks because Modi had refused to invite Pandya to various party meetings.

Even at the last meeting, which was attended by newly-appointed BJP general secretary in-charge Arun Jaitley, Pandya''s name was struck off from the list of invitees at Modi''s behest.

17,Cong demands Central rule in J&K before polls,"SRINAGAR: Asserting that Jammu and Kashmir should be brought under Central rule prior to the Assembly elections, Congress on Tuesday demanded deployment of presiding officers from outside the state for the polls.

""Presiding officers should be deployed from outside the state as was done in 1996 and paramilitary troops be deployed at each polling booth during elections,"" JKPCC vice-president Peerzada Mohammad Syed told reporters here.

""Elections will not be free and fair unless and until Governor''s rule is imposed in the state. People have lost faith in the National Conference regime and they want Central rule in the state so that they could exercise their franchise freely,"" he said.

Syed said Congress had suggested to the Chief Election Commissioner during his visit to the valley that there should be a general shake up in the administration ahead of the polls.

Contesting the government''s claim that Congress activists were being provided adequate security cover, he said ""instead the security provided to some of our wokers are being withdrawn, while NC workers and leaders are enjoying proper and adequate security."" This was done inspite of the recent attack on the Congress headquarters by militants, he added.

18,"Hiroshima Day: CPM rally allowed, SUCI’s dispersed","KOLKATA: The Kolkata police on Tuesday refused to allow the SUCI to hold a protest demonstration against the dropping of the atom bomb on Hiroshima by the USA 57 years ago. A CPM rally on the same issue at the same place was, however, allowed by the same police.

Explaining the apparently discriminatory act of the police, deputy commissioner (headquarters) Sivaji Ghosh said that the SUCI had planned to block the Jawaharlal Nehru Road in front of the American Centre. â€œWe could not allow this. So we prevented them from reaching the spot.â€�

The CPM rally, which was held right in front of the American Centre, crippled the flow of traffic. According to traffic control information, the CPM demonstration was allowed to be staged on the western flank of the road. But even when it gradually it spilled over to the eastern flank, resulting into â€˜spontaneous blockade,â€™ the police apparently turned a blind eye.

Later, irate SUCI members organised a blockade at the Esplanade crossing, bringing traffic to a halt. As requests failed to remove it. The police resorted to lathicharge to disperse the SUCI activists. According to the DC-(Hq), the police arrested 13 SUCI activists including five women.

Meanwhile, several meetings were held in the city on the Day. Addressing one such meet Governor Viren J Shah said: â€œSecurity arrangements in different countries have to be uniform and if one of them has nuclear deterrent, the other cannot be expected not to have the same. But there has to be extreme sense of responsibility and maturity.â€� Shah was addressing a meeting of the World Peace and Friendship Society.

However, state minister of small irrigation and water investigation development Nandagopal Bhattacharya said that nuclear deterrent was â€œuselessâ€� and no country needed it anymore. â€œWe should throw it into the sea and there is no need for a country like us to spend so heavily on de-fence,â€� he remarked. Shah felt that India has been extremely responsible in using its military power. â€œWe have never infiltrated a country or taken it over. The history proves it,â€� he said.

The governor attributed the unrest in the country to factors like unem-ployment and poverty. â€œThese give rise to a tendency of xenophobia,â€� he said. â€œPeace depends on oneâ€™s strength and one has to be strong to maintain peace,â€� he added.

19,Sena to protest block in city’s sugar supply,"MUMBAI: The Shiv Sena on Tuesday said it would challenge the Mumbai Sugar Merchantsâ€™ Associationâ€™s decision to stop supplying sugar to Mumbai from August 1.

The association has stopped sending sugar to the city to protest against the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporationâ€™s decision to increase octroi duty on sugar from one per cent to two per cent from August 1. The octroi duty has increased from Rs 15 to Rs 30 for each bag of sugar.

In a press release issued on Tuesday, the Sena said its activists would take to the streets if the association did not withdraw its decision. The city receives about 20,000 quintals of sugar a day. The shortfall in supply is likely to affect consumers, especially on the eve of the festival season, when demand for sugar shoots up considerably.

â€œAt several places, sugar is being sold between Rs 30 and Rs 35 a kilo. To counter this, Sena corporator Snehal Jadhav has started selling sugar at Rs 15 a kg Dadarâ€™s Dinanath Dalal ground,â€™â€™ the statement said. Sena vibhag pramukhs will hold a meeting on Wednesday to discuss the sugar crisis.

The Federation of Associations of Maharashtra in a press note on Tuesday said representatives of trade, transport and industries would take out a morcha to Azad Maidan on August 9 to protest against the octroi increase.

â€œThereafter, all traders will stop ordering fresh goods from outside to Mumbai. No octroi will be paid from August 10 and the entire trade will picket at octroi nakas,â€™â€™ the press note said.

On July 19, the wholesale trade markets Mumbai and Navi Mumbai had observed bandh to protest against the BMCâ€™s decision. The civic administration has said that the increase in octroi duty on different commodities would fetch it an additional revenue Rs 200 crore a year.
