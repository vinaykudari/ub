1,Naidu tells party ministers to sharpen survival skills,"LUCKNOW: ""Learn to live with the coalition"" was the clear message given by party national president Venkaiah Naidu to BJP ministers while holding a meeting with them on his arrival in Lucknow on Saturday. The meeting, however, remained inconclusive and Naidu will hold another 'class' on Sunday morning to give weary BJP ministers a few tips on sharpening their survival skills in the coalition era. Naidu, who is on a maiden two-day trip to the state capital, closeted with 31 BJP and two LCP ministers along with party state president Vinay Katiyar and Kalraj Mishra, who is in charge of the party's state affairs, at the party headquarters. It was for the first time that the party ministers were given a patient hearing by any central leader. But negative discussion was avoided during Naidu's class, which lasted for about two and a half hours. ""The meeting was suggestive in nature with party ministers airing their views on increasing coordination between the coalition government and the party organisation and listening to the tips from the party president,"" disclosed a senior minister. During the meeting, there were a few anxious moments too when Naidu was caught in crossfire between ministers accusing each other for not giving them free hands. The complaint particularly came from ministers of state accusing their seniors for depriving them of any significant work. A senior minister pointed out that they aired their grievances from time to time in the last one year ever since the coalition came to power but party central leaders never took their grievances seriously. ""As a result, the party failed to give any message to its cadre and the masses,"" the senior minister pointed out. Raising a finger on weak leadership, a few said that BSP ministers were having more say in comparison to them in the coalition ministry. They cited examples of how major chunk of Rs 400 central famine relief was allowed to be distributed in BSP ministers' constituencies and their claims were ignored in distribution of government funds. In between, the party president asked party ministers to improve their performance and have better coordination with the BSP. Naidu pointed out that if the party was failing to give a message then it was due to these two factors. ""We have set a target of 300 seats so Uttar Pradesh is the most crucial for the BJP. It is your responsibility now to help party achieve the target in the Lok Sabha polls,"" said Naidu. Welcoming chief minister's Mayawati's decision to sack Amarmani Tripathi from the cabinet, the BJP president, however, clarified that the decision was not taken under any pressure. ""We are running a coalition government and such incidents affect both the coalition partners. We welcome the decision of the chief minister to order an impartial probe and drop the minister from the cabinet,"" he said. Later, in the evening Naidu called upon the chief minister Mayawati and had dinner with her. In the 25-minute long meeting, he briefed the CM about the minutes of his meeting with BJP ministers held earlier. Naidu suggested better co-ordination among the coalition partners.

2,TRS demands TDP legislator's arrest,"HYDERABAD: The Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS) has demanded that the government arrest Narsampet MLA and TDP general secretary R Prakash Reddy for instigating his party cadre to kill Warangal district TRS BC Cell general secretary Potharaju Prabhakar at Budharaopet on Friday. Speaking to reporters on Saturday, TRS president K Chandrasekhar Rao alleged that Prakash Reddy, during a recent visit to Narsampet, had openly instigated local party activists to attack the TRS leader. Prabhakar played an important role in mobilising large number of people from the mandal to the Telangana Jaitra Yatra meeting at Warangal last month, he added. Chandrasekhar Rao criticised the TDP leaders for claiming at their party's Mini Mahanadu that Telangana had developed only under the TDP rule. The poor attendance at the Mini Mahanadu mirrors the inefficient rule of the TDP, he said. The TRS chief said Telangana was witnessing starvation deaths, migration, suicides of farmers and increase in power charges.

3,Police prevent suicide bid by family,"HYDERABAD: Timely intervention by the Saifabad police prevented a man from committing suicide along with his wife and two children at the Rangareddy district collector's office on Saturday. The man, U Shankar, his wife Jaya and their two daughters— Sai Durga (5) and Sai Rajeswari (8)—went to the collector's office to commit suicide. Shankar, a resident of Anjaiahnagar in Gachibowli told police that he wanted to commit suicide as the local police and revenue authorities 'failed' to do justice for him. His contention is that he was evicted from a house about two years ago in which he lived for over 16 years. The house located in the Anjaiahnagar was part of the Weaker Sections Colony built over 18 years ago for Class-IV employees and it was allotted to one Punyavathi. However, Punyavathi did not occupy the house as the area was not developed at that time. The same was occupied by Shankar. In 1991, Punyavathi sold the house to one Bashir who in turn sold it to someone. Two years back Bashir, Punyavathi and others forcibly evicted Shankar from the house. The latter reportedly got a court order in his favour, police said. But he failed to get possession of the house. Since then he is making rounds to the local revenue and police authorities seeking their help for getting back the possession of the house. However, he could not get the house back and wanted to bring it to the notice of the district collector by attempting a suicide bid. A police team, which was on bandobust duty there, spotted Shankar preparing to set himself ablaze and averted the suicide attempt. The four were taken to the Saifabad police station and a case of attempt to suicide was registered against Shankar. Later, they were released on bail, said the investigating officer N Lakshminarayana.

5,BJP relieved by sacking of tainted UP minister Tripathi,"NEW DELHI: The BJP heaved a sigh of relief following Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Mayawati's decision on Saturday to remove Amarmani Tripathi, the controversial minister in her Cabinet, whose name was linked with the murder of young poetess Madhumita Shukla. Welcoming the decision, BJP spokesperson Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said, ""the step taken by the UP Chief Minister is in the right direction. The inquiry ordered by the state government is a step in the right direction and leaves no moral right for the Opposition parties to make further hue and cry over the Madhumita case."" Ever since this scandal hit the headlines, the BJP had been worried about its possible adverse impact on the BJP-BSP coalition government in UP. Both BJP president Venkaiah Naidu and party spokesperson Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi had been in touch with Mayawati and had advised her to act swiftly in this matter. Naidu had spoken to Mayawati and was slated to meet her in Lucknow on Sunday. The BJP was particularly concerned as this scandal had provided the Opposition in the state with yet another reason to launch a scathing attack against the Mayawati government. It was also keen to defuse the situation soon given the strained relations between the coalition partners. Any further mishandling of this issue would have only worsened the situation. Commenting on the opposition reaction, Naqvi stated it was ironical that the Samajwadi Party and the Congress were out to exploit the situation for narrow political gains despite the fact that their leadership had earlier, on so many occasions, not only remained aloof to the demand of morality but shamelessly gone all out to shield and protect those involved in various crimes and scandals.

6,Cong gears up for Assembly elections,"NEW DELHI: Flyovers in Delhi, infrastructure in Chhattisgarh, Dalit upliftment in Madhya Pradesh and development in Rajasthan coupled with a list of scams and ""anti-farmer"" policies of the Union government are the Congress' campaign highlights for the assembly elections in the next six months. Congress is upbeat about these assembly elections that are expected to set the mood and prepare the time-table for the next general elections. Nevertheless, preparations are on at the AICC level here with chief ministers and party bosses being called to the head quarters to decide on the broad campaign strategy. The first such election strategy committee chaired by Manmohan Singh met on Saturday to make a preliminary assessment and to activate the election machinery in the states. Delhi, Chhattisgarh and Mizoram were discussed with the respective chief ministers and party presidents and Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh would be taken up on Sunday. In all the Congress-ruled states, the CMs would lead the campaign and in fact, the stability of chief ministers as opposed to the BJP frequently changing its former Delhi CMs, would be a campaign plank. So far, there has been no talk of any alliances except may be in Mizoram. Though the Congress admits certain amount of infighting in the Delhi unit, it claims the infighting in the BJP as its biggest advantage. Also to contain the infighting some changes are expected to be made at the organisational level. The AICC general secretary Ambika Soni said, ""Our governments are going to speak about achievements that they are proud of. For instance in Delhi, the CNG buses, the flyovers, better water and electricity supply and lesser pollution than when we came into power, all these would be focussed. Along with this we would number the anti-people, anti-farmer policies that we forced the government to change, like urea prices, powerloom sector problems, telephone tariff."" The Congress seems to be equally confident about Chhattisgarh because of ""the lack of leadership in the BJP there"". In fact, the only major controversy there is the one created by chief minister Ajit Jogi himself. The CM was reluctant to discuss with the media the issue of CBI asking him time to probe the letter that he distributed over a month ago. Soni said that the alleged intelligence bureau letter about Jogi's assets did not figure in the campaign strategy meeting and that, Jogi was confident that the former Congress leader VC Shukla who joined the NCP is no longer a factor in the state politics. Former Mizoram CM and party chief Lalthenhawla participated in the meeting on Mizoram.

7,Anti-Sikh riots inquiry report to be submitted by end of year,"NEW DELHI: Justice Nanavati Commission probing the 1984 anti-Sikh riots is closely examining the role of officials in police and civil administration as Shiromani Gurudwara Prabandhak Committee has specifically demanded a clear finding against those guilty of dereliction of duty. ""Submission of the Sikh body -- SGPC is that a detailed inquiry should be held in respect of dereliction of duty of each officer and a clear finding should be given against them,"" Justice G T Nanavati said. Expressing confidence that the report would be submitted by the year end, he said ""I am writing the report as the recording of evidence has been completed"". The writing of the report would be over by the end of July, whereafter the Section 8(b) procedure of Commission of Inquiry Act would have to be followed to give an opportunity to those officials and individuals against whom the Commission was inclined to record a finding, he said. Justice Nanavati said summoning of witnesses and recording of evidence takes a lot of time. The Section 8(b) procedure was also expected to take some time as the officials and individuals have to be summoned for recording of their statements as per their and their counsel's convenience, he added. Asked about the role of army in controlling the riots, Justice Nanavati said that the Sikhs have contended that the army was not deployed timely and adequately, otherwise riots could have been controlled quite early. He said the witnesses before the commission had said that army had performed its duties well but it was a lapse on the part of civil administration not to call them in time resulting in largescale rioting and loss of lives. Giving a tentative time-table of the Commission's work in the coming months, the retired Supreme Court Judge said the Section 8(b) notices would be out by August and the consequent proceedings of recording the statements of the officials summoned would be over by end of October. He said it would take 15 to 20 days for finalising the report and then its printing work would be undertaken. The report would be ready for submission by December this year, he added.

8,Riots probe panel says no lapse by Modi govt,"NEW DELHI: Justice G T Nanavati, heading the two-member commission to probe the 2002 Gujarat riots, on Sunday said the evidence recorded so far did not indicate any serious lapse on the part of the police or administration in controlling the communal clashes that followed the Godhra incident. The commission, which has completed the task of recording evidence in all the areas except the most-affected Ahmedabad and Vadodra as also Bharuch and Narmada, would begin its last leg of recording evidence from July 15 in the four districts. Asked about the evidence so far collected on the role of police and district administrations, Justice Nanavati said that ""the evidence recorded so far in other districts do not show any serious lapse on the part of police and the civil administration"". Going through the strenuous process of visiting each and every district headquarters of the affected areas, the commission had given time to one and all to file additional affidavits on the alleged incidents that had taken place in their locality in February-March 2002. ""An additional opportunity has been given to those who have missed the opportunity to file the affidavit and to all concerned to say whatever they want to say before the commission on the incidents,"" Justice Nanavati said. Prior to recording the evidence in Ahmedabad and Vadodra, the two cities most affected in the riots, the commission will complete the task in Bharuch and Narmada, he said.

9,Sharif's brother plans return; may face arrest,"ISLAMABAD: The brother of deposed Premier Nawaz Sharif and Pakistan Muslim League (N) leader, Shahbaz Sharif on Sunday said he would soon return home to lead his party while asking opposition parties agitating against President Pervez Musharraf's constitutional amendments to display some flexibility. Shahbaz, currently convalescing after an operation in New York said, he has decided to return in June or July even if it violated the agreement his family had with Pakistan and Saudi Arabian governments. Under the agreement, Nawaz Sharif along with Shahbaz were exiled to Jeddah. Shahbaz was recently permitted to go to New York to undergo the operation. Interestingly, Shahbaz whose party, PML-N also opposed Musharraf's presidency and the constitutional amendments wanted the opposition parties, to work out an agreement with the government to tide over the crisis. ""This is a transitional period. The transfer of power to the civilian government is still going on, and the political parties should show flexibility in reaching an agreement with treasury benches,"" he told local daily Dawn from New York. His comments follow speculation in the local media that hectic efforts were being made by officials here to secure the support of Sharifs and former Premier Benazir Bhutto to stave off the constitutional crisis. With the Islamist alliance, Muthahid Majlis Amal (MMA) demanding that Musharraf quit as Chief of Army in order to get Parliament's endorsement for his Presidency and constitutional reforms, the government was trying hard to reach an understanding with Sharif and Benazir. Both Shahbaz and Bhutto reportedly insisted that their return as a quid pro quo arrangement besides the release of Benazir's spouse, Asif Ali Zardari from his six year prison sentence. However, the PPP denied any talks with the government to strike a deal. ""Reports appearing in section of the press that the PPP is secretly negotiating with the regime to get ""concessions"" for Benazir Bhutto and Asif Ali Zardari while publicly pursuing a hard line on the LFO are not only wrong but seem to be fabricated with a view to malign the Party and its leadership, and are denied"", a PPP press release here said. Meanwhile, a lawyers' convention in Karachi yesterday resolved to continue the struggle against the Legal Framework Order (LFO) which incorporates the amendments proposed by Musharraf. Warning the opposition parties against striking any deal with the government, a resolution passed at the convention said ""the order is a device to perpetuate Musharraf in the self-assumed office of president, which he has, like past military rulers, usurped through extra-constitutional means."" The convention described the government's decision to give three years extension to judges as a ""political bribery"" aimed at undermining the judiciary's independence and credibility. ""It has no legal validity and the retiring judges should lay down their robes on reaching the constitutionally-prescribed age of superannuation"".

10,RSS for CBI probe into Marad incident,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: RSS on Sunday asked Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani to convince the Kerala government to order a CBI probe into the May 2 violence at Marad in Kozhikode district, which claimed nine lives, saying only that could bring out the ""real facts"" behind the incident. In a memorandum submitted to Advani at the Rajabhavan here, leaders of RSS' Kerala unit alleged that moves were on to scuttle an objective and impartial investigation as police were already in possession of evidence that allegedly pointed to the involvement of the workers of IUML, CPM and National Development Front (a radical Muslim organisation). ""In the circumstances, only an investigation by the CBI will help to bring out the real facts,"" the memorandum signed by RSS Prantha Sanghachalak P E B Menon, said. The Centre should do the needful to convince the Kerala government about the need to entrust the investigation to CBI and take further steps to hand over the case to CBI, the memorandum, a copy of which was released to press, said. RSS also asked the Centre to expedite the process of deploying coast guard in the Kerala coast and also strengthen activities of the Central intelligence. BJP leader and Minister of State for Defence O Rajagopal, BJP state president K Padmanabhan and party's state vice-president P S Sreedharan Pillai also met Advani and discussed the political situation in the state with him.

11,Traffic rules to be part of school curriculum,"KANPUR: Traffic rules are all set to become an integral part of the 'curriculum' in city schools from the forthcoming academic session which begins July. Work on this ambitious and a first-of-its kind scheme, undertaken by the city traffic police, has been set rolling and a meeting of 12 major schools in this regard recently put its stamp of approval on it. It has been mutually agreed between school authorities and the traffic department that all school diaries given to students would have traffic rules embossed on the back cover. It has also been decided that the traffic department would get all inner walls of the schools painted with slogans of traffic discipline. Soft drink major Coca Cola has agreed to bear the cost of this campaign in 20 schools, SP (traffic) Rakesh Singh told Times News Network (TNN) on Sunday. Not to stop at this, the traffic cops have already begun a workshop for rickshaw pullers who ferry kids to schools. The training workshops, which began on May 2 are currently on at the traffic lines and more than 245 rickshaw pullers have so far taken part in the initiation session into safe driving. Traffic department has also decided to do similar sessions for school bus drivers and enroll them into a seven-day crash course, which begins later this month. We are trying to make a foolproof safety system so that schoolgoing kids are not subjected to any risk while commuting to and from schools Singh pointed out. Representatives of financial companies and other major companies last week held discussions with the traffic top brass at a city hotel where nitty gritty of sponsoring such drives were discussed, an official informed. Several schools and colleges like BNSD, Shilling House, St Mary's and Jaipuria, have already given their consent for the project which aims at 'catching 'em young' as far as traffic rules are concerned, an official added. The second phase would be set rolling after the traffic cops complete training of the drivers of school rickshaws and buses. After the training they would be given colour specific caps — to be sponsored by a financial company — so that trained persons could be identified while untrained ones be penalised for not attending the training sessions. All rickshaws taking kids to schools have been asked to get reflectors fitted and to remove iron contraptions which have been extended to make more and more accomodation for kids to sit.

12,40 arrested for blocking railway track,"RAMKOLA (KUSHINAGAR): Forty persons including Radhey Shyam Singh MLA, Purnavashi Dehati MLA and former member of Parliament Baleshwar Yadav were arrested by the district administration on Saturday for blocking the railway track for at least ten hours in protest against the closure of Ramkola Punjab Chini Mill. All arrested persons were sent to Deoria district jail. The situation reached an alarming stage when the management of the sugar mill decided suddenly to stop the crushing of sugarcane in the wee hours of Saturday. About 500 tractor trolleys, bullock carts and trucks loaded with canes were waiting their turns to unload the canes. The sudden closure of the mill's gate made farmers violent. They broke the gate entered inside and smashed window panes of offices and damaged some furniture. Security guards of the mill used mild force to disperse them. The message of closure of mill reached the neigbhouring villages by early morning and thousands of farmers assembled at the gate. They staged a dharna over the railway track adjacent to the mill. Meanwhile, on hearing the news, Radhey Shyam Singh MLA, Purnavashi Dehati MLA and former MP Baleshwar Yadav also arrived on the scene to encourage the agitating farmers. They also sat on a dharna over the railway track. The district magistrate and superintendent of police, Kushinagar along with force also reached the spot after sometime and tried to vacate the railway track. When they did not agree, the administration ordered their arrest. It may be recalled that Sevrahi, Captanganj, Ramkola Khetan, Luxmiganj Sugar mills of Kushinagar district were already closed without crushing their allotted cane produce. Farmers were depending only over Ramkola Punjab sugar mill for supply of their canes which too closed on Saturday. It is said that the management of the sugar mill had obtained the permission of Allahabad High Court in advance and had asked them not to press them to crush more than 50 lakh quintal of sugarcane in the current crushing season.

13,Stop Mayawati's dictator rule: Mulayam,"VARANASI: Samajwadi Party (SP) supremo, Mulayam Singh Yadav asked the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led government at the Centre either to stop chief minister Mayawati from ruling UP like a dictator or get ready to face an aggressive public movement like the JP movement. Yadav, who addressed two election meetings at Nai Basti and Benihari Bada areas in Chiraigaon assembly area on Sunday, said that the UP was suffering due to the dictatorial attitude of chief minister Mayawati. Similar situation were created by former prime minister Indira Gandhi by declaring emergency in the country in '70s, he said adding that the then government was totally unaware about the anger generated among the countrymen and a revolt took place under the leadership of Jai Prakash Narain. He said more delay could worsen the condition of state people. Challenging the CM, he said that all political parties and politicians had surrendered before the dictatorial attitude of Mayawati, but SP would never follow that path. I have the experience of jail and I also know how to come out of it, he said and added further that instead of coming up with threats of sending me behind bars, Mayawati should take care of herself and the ministers of her cabinet who were involved in criminal activities. He said the CM spent hours with top bureaucrats and police officials on April 16 to change the direction of investigation in the Madhumita murder case. He said that Mayawati had prepared a platform to show the involvement of Amar Singh and Raghuraj Pratap Singh in the Madhumita murder case. He said it was shocking that the CM was utilising the guilty in this murder case to woo Brahmins. The result of this by-election would make it clear whether Mayawati had succeeded in convincing the Brahmins by protecting a criminal minister or not, said Yadav and added that the Brahmins of state were well aware that Mulayam Singh was standing with the bereaved family of Madhumita Shukla. The SP president also criticised Mayawati for posing herself as a 'Dalit ki beti'. After assuming a responsible post like CM, a man becomes the patron of all, he said adding that by posing herself as the daughter of a dalit she was making it clear that she was casteist. Highlighting the problems of farmers, students, youths and women he said that not only the interest of common people but their sentiments were also being hurt by by the CM who was insulting their gods. However, the SP general secretary, Amar Singh kept the gathering laughing by making a mockery of the CM. During her stay here on Saturday, Mayawati made it very clear among people that she was the 'amma' of not only legendary leaders like Mahatma Gandhi, Pandit Jawahar Lal Nehru and Radhakrishnan but also of the prime minister and deputy prime minister. After knowing her, I have also decided to call her mummy, he said. Singh said that by targeting him during her entire speech, Mayawati had proved her eligibility to become his publicity in-charge. She had challenged that Singh was coward, he said and added that he was ready to contest election from any of the 80 seats in state. He said the CM should stop producing threats like sending him to jail. If I am unable to bring Raghuraj Pratap Singh out of jail, I am ready to give him company there, said the SP leader who ended with a parody, tera pichcha na chhodunga rajniti ke khel me, chahey jail bhej de. The SP also produced Bollywood actor, Raza Murad at the dais, who tried to woo the minority during his speech. Many senior party leaders and office-bearers including Shivpal Singh Yadav, Akhilesh Yadav and Mohan Singh were also present.
