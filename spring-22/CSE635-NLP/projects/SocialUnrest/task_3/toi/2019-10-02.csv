0,Govt delinks Akshardham temple attack from riots,"GANDHINAGAR: A week after the terrorist attack on Akshardham, the government is refusing to look within for reasons of the attack, on the Akshardham temple.

Pursuing the line taken by Chief Minister Narendra Modi, additional chief secretary (home) Ashok Narayan feels there is no point â€œwasting timeâ€� in finding out whether local connections existed.

The official position, it is believed, arises from the fact that the government would not like communal riots to emerge as the root cause of the attack.

This, despite the fact that letters found on the two slain terrorists clearly mentioned that the temple attack was to avenge the killings in the riots.

Talking to TNN Narayan said, â€œThe chief minister has already clarified that the letters were planted to misguide probe agencies. There is no point in doubting that view.â€� Added Narayan, â€œThe main thing is to fight terrorism, not to go into its social roots.â€�

This view comes when dissenting voices in the administration suggest that issues like the government failing to provide a healing touch to riots victims and provocative utterances by politicians against the minority community added to the woes. Commented a senior police officer, â€œInvestigations are going on in a pre-determined fashion.â€�

Officials emphasised that both the deputy prime minister LK Advani and Modi, by declaring that there was no local connection, put an end to all investigations even before they actually began. Such is the situation now that no one is even considering the letters found in the terroristsâ€™ pockets as a prima facie evidence.

â€œIn an effort to prove Advani and Modi correct, the investigating officers are trying to find the outside connectionâ€�, said a senior police official.

Narayan further adds, â€œThere is no point in going into the reasons of any terrorist act anywhere in the world. No amount of healing would help in the fight against terrorism.â€� He added, â€œThere are no ethnic or religious reasons behind terrorism. Terrorism knows no values or religion. The feeling of a particular community or ethnic group being neglected cannot find expression in an terrorist act.â€�

3,Congmen clash as senior leaders remain mute spectators,"PURNIA: Even as Oscar Fernandes, national general secretary of Congress, and Shakeel Ahmad, partyâ€™s state president, visited Purnia on Sunday to revamp the partyâ€™s district unit, which has been plagued by dissensions and bitter rivalry among the partyâ€™s rank and file, the infighting within the party came to the fore as the party workers openly clashed and indulged in mud-slinging.

According to well-informed sources, the warring groups, armed with lathis, lethal weapons, and even rifles, clashed in the presence of senior party leaders in the party office. Senior party leaders remained mute spectators of the sordid drama, which has brought much embarrassment to the party in the region.

Party sources told TNN on Sunday evening in Purnea that some aggrieved party functionaries led by Dinkar Snehi, divisional Youth Congress president and Sushil Sharma, former Town unit president, wanted to submit a memorandum to the visiting party dignitaries which was a virtual â€œcharge-sheetâ€� against K K Mandal, district chief of the party.

When the Mandal loyalists got wind of the move they reportedly tried to counter them. Expectedly there was a slinging match between the warring groups and they nearly fought a pitched battle.

The ugly situation was, however, successfully contained by the security guards present at the Gokul Ashram. Party sources confirmed that both the groups were fully armed and had madetheir intention clear to settle the score.

The party general secretary, Oscar Fernandes, and the BPCC chief, however, continued their agenda and urged upon the party workers to set their house in order and worked unitedly to regain the fading pristine glory of the party and consolidated its support base.

They said Congress was the only alternative to both the BJP at the Centre and RJD at the state level.

4,Bihar bandh partial,"PATNA: The Left Coordination Committee (LCC)-sponsored Bihar bandh had a partial impact in the state. The bandh was also supported by CPI-ML, Nationalist Congress Party and Lok Janshakti Party, apart from three NDA MPsâ€”Devendra Yadav (JD-U), Manjay Lal and Arun Kumar (both of Samata Party)â€”from outside.

In Patna, there was no effect of the bandh as almost all shops and business establishments remained open, vehiclesâ€”both private and publicâ€”plied as usual, schools, colleges, government as well as non-government offices functioned normally.

The LCCâ€”comprising CPI, CPM, Forward Bloc, SUCI and RSPâ€”had given the bandh call to protest, what they called, alarming decline in the law and order situation in the state and to lodge a protest against the decision to down shutters on the Hindustan Fertiliser Corporationâ€™s Barauni unit and some other industrial units, leading to a virtual de-industrialisation of Bihar.

The day remained peaceful despite efforts of the bandh supporters to disrupt movement of the rail and road traffic across the state.

According to reports, the bandh failed to evoke response in Gaya, Jehanabad, Muzaffarpur, Darbhanga, Vaishali, Sitamarhi, Aurangabad, Samastipur and Patna districts, while it did have some impact in Begusarai and Khagaria districts.

Bandh supporters squatted on the railway tracks and demonstrated at Begusarai and Barauni stations in Begusarai district, resulting in detention of Katihar-Patna Janshatabdi Express, Awadh-Assam Express and Vaishali Express trains for a few hours at Begusarai, Teghra and Barauni stations. Train movement was also reportedly disrupted at Madhepura and Koparia station in Saharsa district.

Road traffic was affected on the National Highway-28 and 31 for several hours, as left activists blocked roads throughout the day at Begusarai, Khagaria, Maheshkhut, Parbatta and Madhepura areas.

In Patna, the left partiesâ€™ leaders while enforcing bandh were arrested at the Dak Bungalow crossing. The arrested leaders included CPI state secretary Jalaluddin Ansari, among others.

As per the state police headquarters report, altogether 429 left partiesâ€™ workers were arrested or courted arrest across the state, out of which 235 were arrested in Patna, 134 in Khagaria and 60 in Purnia. It added that the rail-road traffic was disrupted in Begusarai, Madhubani, Supaul and Samastipur districts.

As for the bandh supporters, near-failure of the agitation is bound to give sleepless nights to the sensitive leaders of not only the left parties but also the parties and the MPs, extending their support to the bandh.

5,Second probe rules out rape in hospital,"MUMBAI: The second inquiry conducted into the alleged rape of a patient at Sion hospital on September 24 has ruled out that the woman was sexually assaulted.

The report also states that â€œthere was no evidence to even establish that the woman was molestedâ€™â€™.

Although the hospital authorities that conducted the first inquiry claimed that medical investigations had ruled out rape, the public health committee of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation had demanded a fresh investigation.

Acting dean Geeta Koppikar of the BYL Nair hospital, who was asked to conduct a detailed investigation, completed her investigations on Monday and submitted the report to additional municipal commissioner Sitaram Kunte on Tuesday.

While Mr Kunte refused to comment, a senior civic official said that the inquiry established that the woman was suffering from trauma after giving birth to a dead child on September 24.

6,Dengue alert in Pimpri-Chinchwad,"PUNE: The health department of the Pimpri-Chinchwad municipal corporation (PCMC) has identified five potential breeding places of the Aedes aegypti mosquito, responsible for dengue fever.

The municipal staff has been ordered to carry out pesticide fogging in these areas.

PCMC chief medical officer K. Nagkumar told TNN on Tuesday, â€œTesting at other places is in progress. The results of blood samples collected from recent patients and stagnant water samples from suspected mosquito-breeding spots have been sent to zonal entomologist V.R.

7,Girl students gherao minister in Kurnool,"KURNOOL: The girl students of Kurnool PG Centre gheraoed minister for higher education N Md Farooq here on Tuesday for not allotting a newly constructed building for their hostel.

Farooq visited the PG Centre to inaugurate a building that has been constructed at a cost of Rs 25 lakh. The UGC had released funds for building a girls'' hostel, but the PG centre officials allocated it to the MCA and MBA classes.

Expressing their resentment over the decision, the girls gheraoed the minister and asked him to allot the building for their hostel as there was no hostel for PG girls. The girls told the minister that they were coming from the city, which is about 5 km away from the PG Centre.

The girls stopped him from inaugurating the building and told him that unless he gives a written assurance over the allocation of building for their hostel, they would not allow him to inaugurate it. They raised slogans against Sri Krishnadevaraya University registrar Venkata Naidu.

The minister assured them that he would see to it that the building was allotted to them as soon as the construction of the compound wall was completed. Later, the girls allowed the minister to inaugurate the building, but did not allow the registrar to enter the new building. The minister, accompanied by vice-chancellor Iqbal Ahmed, district collector G Sai Prasad and other officials visited the building.

Addressing the gathering, the minister said that the district collector would organise a meeting with the girl students of the PG centre to discuss the pros and cons of allotting the building for the girls'' hostel. S K University governing body member D Allabakash, PG Centre special officer Buddanna and others were present.

Though, the administration had issued a notification to fill 873 posts, it could find only 725 successful candidates.

However, 725 candidates who successfully passed the test would get appointment and posting orders through counselling.

10,Give top priority to farm sector: Naidu,"HYDERABAD: Chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu on Tuesday instructed officials of Transco and power distribution companies to give top priority to supply of electricity to the agriculture sector and ensure nine hours of power to farm pumpsets.

14,BSNL may offer free incoming on mobiles,"NEW DELHI: In the highly competitive market in cellular telephony, Bharat Sanchar Nigam (BSNL) is contemplating offering free incoming calls on its cellular services scheduled to be launched on October 19.

According to highly placed sources in BSNL, the corporation would have to offer something different from the existing cellular operators which were offering free incoming within their own cellular networks.

Asked whether BSNL had filed its tariff proposals with the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI), officials said that the numbers were being worked out and a final decision would be taken soon.

They, however, said that it should not be difficult for BSNL to offer free incoming from the landline phones as the corporation owned more than 90 per cent of the market share of landline subscribers in the country.

BSNL is the licence holder for offering cellular services in the entire country except in two metros of Delhi and Mumabi where another state owned Mahanagar Telephone Nigam (MTNL) is offering cellular services.

BSNL last month had announced launch of its cellular services under the brand name ''CellOne''.

When contacted, BSNL chairman and managing director Prithipal Singh said that the cellular services would be launched on October 19 from Lucknow by Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.

Earlier, the corporation had announced launching services from October 2.

Meanwhile, BSNL has started negotiations with MTNL for offering national roaming to its cellular subscribers from day one of its launch.

Singh had earlier said that the corporation was hopeful of signing the roaming agreement with MTNL before the launch of its nationwide cellular services.

""We do not foresee any problem for a full-fledged roaming agreement with MTNL and we feel it would be beneficial for both the sides,"" Singh had said, adding the move would also allow MTNL cellular customers to roam across various circles.

15,SUCI violence toll goes up to four,"KOLKATA: One person was gunned down on Wednesday night at Nalgara village in South 24-Parganas district, taking the toll to four in the continuing violence since the attack on the SUCI office in the area.

Inspector-General of Police (law and order) Chayan Mukherjee said that some miscreants dragged one Kalipada Mal out of his house at Nalgara on Wednesday night and fired at him. He died on Thursday.

The police had all along maintained that two persons were killed in the attack on the SUCI office, but on Thursday clarified that three persons were killed in the incident.

With last nightâ€™s gunning down of a person, the toll in the continuing violence rose to four.

Ten persons were arrested in connection with the violence since Tuesday, Mukherjee said. The police was continuing combing operations in the area.

Meanwhile, Sunderbans Affairs minister Kanti Ganguly claimed that Mal was a CPM supporter and was killed by SUCI activists in â€œfull public glareâ€�.

Referring to the incident on Tuesday night, Ganguly said that it was triggered when miscreants, led by a local gangster, looted seven local shops.

Describing as â€œunfortunateâ€� allegations by the SUCI that Tuesdayâ€™s attack on its office at Nalgara was conducted at his behest, Ganguly said that he was being â€œtargetedâ€� by the SUCI which was worried about a break-up within its ranks.

Ganguly, however, offered an olive branch to the SUCI, saying that he was willing to share platform with them in holding joint peace programmes at Nalgara and adjoining areas. Meanwhile, the SUCI claimed that its 12-hour bandh in South 24 Parganas district, following Tuesdayâ€™s attack.

16,"3 NC workers killed, 19 injured in subsequent clash","SRINAGAR: Three National Conference activists were shot dead by militants in Kupwara district for ""actively participating in the assembly polls"" in Jammu and Kashmir triggering protest demonstration by residents who clashed with police in which 19 people, including seven police personnel, were injured on Wednesday.

The three NC workers, identified as head of Haihama village Mohammad Yousuf Dar, Sanaullah Khan and Ghulam Qadir Bhat, were killed while they were returning from a security forces camp late last night, police sources said.

However, the villagers, alleging that the three were killed by security personnel after being summoned to a security camp, tried to march towards the office of Deputy Commissioner of Kupwara, they said.

The protestors clashed with the police and threw stones at them injuring seven police personnel, including a DSP, prompting the police to resort to the lathicharge. When they failed to disperse the violent protestors, they burst teargas shells and fired in the air. Twelve protestors were injured in the clash.

Inspector General of Police K Rajindra Kumar said some miscreants were trying to take advantage of the public anger by creating law and order problems. ""We cannot let the situation go out of hand.....Legal action has to be taken.""

17,"Dump new economic policy, says RSS","NEW DELHI: In an emphatic thumbs down to the pro-privatisation sections in the government, RSS chief K Sudershan said on Wednesday that those attempting to ""ape the west"" and open the economy to foreign investors should be removed from key posts.

Making a scathing attack on ""those who want to follow the western path of development"", Sudershan picked Mahatma Gandhi''s birth anniversary and a valedictory address at a function of the Delhi RSS to warn the government against a ""videshi"" onslaught and pat it on its back for its ""swadeshi"" achievements.

Among those, rural-oriented encouragment to ethanol and bio-diesel and the saffronisation of education after the British systematically ""desaffronised"" it. ""Saffronisation of the education policy is a must today and we welcome it,"" said Sudershan.

Calling for strengthening of village economy and the nation at the grassroots, the RSS chief said that there were two thought processes in the Planning Commission, one which was for developing villages and indigenous technology and the other which ""wants to open the economy completely to foreign direct investment"", which would ""enslave small entrepreneurs once again"".

The western model of development was not suited to Indian needs, he said, adding ""a swadeshi development model has to be evolved"". ""Those who feel that the western model is the right one have to be removed from key posts,"" the RSS chief suggested.

Prominent in the audience at the RSS function was Petroleum Minister Ram Naik, a key player in the disinvestment controversy. Naik is one of the hardliners in the Cabinet who is against privatisation of PSUs through strategic sale, especially in the case of petroleum PSUs.

Naik met Defence Minister George Fernandes and Human Resource Development Minister Murli Manohar Joshi on Wednesday morning to discuss the issue.

The two other ministers are similarly inclined, with Fernandes having written a letter to the Prime Minister on the matter.

While Joshi met the RSS chief on Tuesday, all three ministers are scheduled to meet him soon on the disinvestment issue. But blessings from the RSS seemed to come even before the meeting at Wednesday''s function.

Naik told reporters: ""We are not against disinvestment. We just want the entire policy to be reviewed.""

Describing the morning meeting with his colleagues at Joshi''s residence as an ""exchange of ideas"", he said that the issue of divestment in sectors like oil and defence had been under dicussion in the government for over a month now and the Prime Minister would call a meeting soon to evolve a consensus. ""There is a three-month period and the PM will decide,"" he said.

Asked if they had held discussions with Disinvestment Minister Arun Shourie, too, Naik merely said: ""We keep talking."" He added that Fernandes was discussing the matter with other NDA allies, while he had met Congress leaders Shivraj Patil and Priyaranjan Dasmunshi.

Also seen at the massive RSS function were ministers Shanta Kumar, Vijay Goel, Sahib Singh Verma and I D Swamy, apart from BJP leaders Madanlal Khurana and Anita Arya.

In his attack on the ""videshi"", Sudershan clinched his argument linking even the scourge of terrorism to economic inequity, saying it stemmed from the Nehruvian decision to follow the western model which was ""centralised, urban-based, high energy consumptive, capital intensive, labour-displacive, eco-destructive"" as opposed to Gandhi''s espousal of ""decentralised, rural-based, employing less capital, less energy consuming, labour intensive, eco friendly."" The Sangh, he said, stood for that.

Sangh outfits have been attacking the Centre''s economic policy, with the Swadeshi Jagran Manch, Bharatiya Kisan Sangh and Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh launching a nationwide agitation.

18,Children call for end to violence,"NEW DELHI: Over 1,000 school children participated in a peace march from Pragati Maidan to Rajghat to mark the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi on Wednesday. There was palpable enthusiasm among children who marched upto the Rajghat holding placards.

â€˜â€˜We intend to spread the message of peace,â€™â€™ said Kunal Patel of Springdales School, Pusa Road.

The recent communal violence in Gujarat appeared to be fresh in the minds of peace marchers. â€˜â€˜Gujarat violence is a cruel reality. It is unfortunate that the state where Mahatma spent so much time witnessed incidents of violence recently,â€™â€™ said Stuthi of Bluebells International School, Kailash Colony.

The children had started converging at the starting point of the march near Pragati Maidan early. â€˜â€˜I am very enthusiastic to be a part of the movement to spread peace,â€™â€™ said Shrutika of St Thomas School.

â€˜â€˜Mahatma Gandhiâ€™s birthday is a special day and events like this help us remember him,â€™â€™ she said.

Sahiba of the same school was happy she was also a part of the peace march. â€˜â€˜Students from different communities and backgrounds have come together for the march,â€™â€™ she said.

Earlier, former prime minister V P Singh called upon the children to follow the ideals of Mahatma Gandhi. Swami Agnivesh, chief organiser of the march organised by the Bharat Nirman Maha Abhiyan, also urged children to spread Mahatmaâ€™s message of peace.

19,Govt delays formation of sugar policy,"BANGALORE: In a classic case of Nero fiddling while Rome was burning, the Karnataka government is dillydallying over formulation of a sugar policy which could revive the livelihood of lakhs of farmers in the Krishna and Cauvery basins.

With plunging prices, over Rs 1,600 crore worth of sugar stock-piled in godowns, and drought and factory dues running into crores, the situation in Karnataka could not get grimmer. Industry experts feel that Karnataka -- the third largest sugar producer in India -- looks set to emulate Maharashtra and Bihar, where over 20 factories closed down in recent times.

The state government announced over an year ago that a concrete effort would be made to revitalise the sector through a ``comprehensive sugar policy'''' on issues like cane areas, marketing of sugar, diversification, funding and so on. Expected to be announced in September 2001, the policy has not got off the discussion table yet.

Sources told The Times of India that the biggest stumbling block in formulating the policy has been allocation of cane-growing areas to cater to the factories. Karnataka has 35 sugar cane crushing factories, with 16 more in an advanced stage of construction.

Following 88 applications for new factories, however, the government is in the piquant situation of finding cane-growing areas for them, even as drought and water disputes limit the farmers'' sugar cane growing potential. ``Supply to existing factories itself is barely adequate. How can cane areas be allocated to any more?'''' sources asked.

Industry watchers pointed out that a similar situation destroyed factories in Maharashtra when the BJP-Shiv Sena government, in 1996-97, lifted zoning of cane areas per factory. With growers permitted to sell to whichever factory gave the highest price, regular supply was stopped to several factories, which closed down.

Sources said several rounds of official meetings have been held at the district level to identify, map and discuss cane-growing areas in the sugar-intensive districts. ``Things are moving towards a final stage, but it is still difficult to predict when the policy will be announced,'''' sources admitted.

When contacted, Sugar Secretary Ashok Dalwai said the state-level committee headed by Industries Secretary K.K. Misra was working on the policy. ``Meanwhile, we have given several incentives to the sugar factories in terms of sales tax and purchase tax on sugar cane to help them. We have also suggested that the existing factories should increase their crushing capacity to over 2,500 tonne to make them financially viable,'''' he outlined.

20,Tougher laws push up drug seizures,"NEW DELHI: Thanks to legal amendments that make it easier to confiscate the assets of drug traffickers, the Delhi Police says it has tightened the noose on the drug mafia.

This year the narcotics branch has frozen assets worth over Rs 2.55 crore and also seized more drugs than the total amount in the last five years. It has proposed 30 cases against traffickers of whom 22 have been detained.

â€˜â€˜Since 1988, the narcotics cell has had very strong powers but these were not being used effectively,â€™â€™ said D L Kashyap, deputy commissioner of police (narcotics).

Seizures by the narcotics branch in 2001 surpassed in quantity the total amount seized in five years, beginning 1996. This year it has seized 55 kg of heroin, 42 kg of opium, 56 kg of hashish and over 71 kg of poppy husk. At least 73 cases have been registered and 112 persons arrested.

The narcotics branch probably took a cue from the US authorities where freezing of assets are routine. Kashyap describes the assets of traffickers as contraband property. â€˜â€˜They are built with illegal drug money,â€™â€™ the DCP said.

Till a year ago, the authorities were not boasting about the situation. A senior police officer said the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act of 1985 was not an effective deterrent as offenders were frequently released on technical grounds.

â€˜â€˜The Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act became a little more effective after it was amended in 1988. But more authority was required and that came with assets forfeiture provision in 1989,â€™â€™ the senior officer said.

â€˜â€˜From October 2001, assets can be frozen the moment a suspect is arrested or an arrest warrant is issued,â€™â€™ Kashyap said.

Qamar Ahmed, additional commissioner of police (crime), said: â€˜â€˜The law on property forfeiture is stringent. It is yielding results, by putting a check on the money being made out of illicit drugs. After all, there are huge cash transactions and where does this money go?â€™â€™

Under current laws, even district police officials can initiate a financial investigation against a suspected trafficker, including jewellery, vehicles, land and houses. â€˜â€˜It also covers family members and relatives,â€™â€™ Ahmed said.

This year, the narcotics branch proposed 30 cases against suspected drug traffickers of which 22 have been detained and the remaining eight cases are under consideration. The process of confiscating assets of those convicted has started too, Kashyap said.

21,Chemists flouting rules in Ferozepur,"FEROZEPUR: The presence of large number of illegal retail chemist shops operating and around the city has put a question mark on the functioning of the drug authorities of the district.

According to the norms of Drug Act, only a diploma a degree holder of pharmacy can run chemist shops while a majority of chemist shop owners here don''t have any required diploma or degree to their credit.

""Most of these chemists hire the required diploma or degree on monthly basis from a qualified person,"" sources added.

They said that a majority pharmacists were misusing their diploma or degree lending them and using same as an extra source income.

The qualified person many times is not even aware in which area or city or her diploma is being utilised.

An official of the local civil surgeon office, on condition of anonymity, told Times News Network that no permanent drug inspector was posted at Ferozepur and area was being looked after by a drug inspector of the other district, who visits the city only twice a week.

Under the Drug Act, every chemist is supposed to maintain a register of the medicine available in the shop but this rule is also not being followed in the district.

Sources said that some chemists of the city do not even qualify the space specification of 120 sq meter and were running their shops without refrigerators.

Sources said that due to the lack of checking by the drug authorities such illegal chemist shops were minting money by selling sub-standard and spurious medicines.

Anti-leprosy campaign launched: Ferozepur deputy commissioner Dhirender Kumar Tiwari launched a special anti-leprosy campaign on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, the father of the nation, on Wednesday. The campaign would continue till October 31.

A seminar to this effect was arranged at the local Kusht Ashram, in which leaders of social service organisations, school and college students, and volunteers of the Punjab Police took part.

22,Pay full bonus: Sukhbir to govt,"CHANDIGARH: Former Union minister and Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) general secretary Sukhbir Singh Badal said here on Wednesday that his party had rejected the government''s decision to pay Rs 30 per quintal bonus to farmers in three instalments.

He said the bonus promised to paddy growers in 2001 by the Congress should be given as a lump sum as it would have no meaning if it paid after two years. The government''s belated decision, he said, had finally exposed the chief minister''s cooked-up pretext that it had been deferred the past due to poor economic condition of the state.

If he could pay it now, he could have as well paid it in the past, too,"" Sukhbir added. He said the chief minister had announced the payment instalments as he knew he may not be around in April and October next year, when the remaining amount was to paid.

Describing the decision as a victory for the farmers of the state and a vindication of the stand of the SAD, Sukhbir Badal said the chief minister''s refusal to take the right decision in this regard was motivated by political considerations.

Sukhbir accused the chief minister of unforgivable sloth and indifference to the preparation of a strong case for higher MSP and presenting it to the Centre in time.

He reiterated his party''s resolve not to have any dealings with the ruling party till it took steps to fulfil its election promises, including the full payment of bonus on paddy, free power for farmers, continuation of welfare schemes like shagun and oldage pension schemes, etc.

23,Tohra demands separate gas stations for farmers,"PATIALA: Floating a new idea in favour of the peasantry, Sarb Hind Shiromani Akali Dal president Gurcharan Singh Tohra, while addressing a press conference here on Wednesday, said that the government should set up separate filling stations for farmers where they could get diesel to run their agriculture machinery at a fair price.

Expressing concern over the frequent hike in the prices of petrol and diesel, he said that it was difficult to bear for the farmers.

Tohra said that the Rs-20 relief on MSP for paddy was a cruel joke on farmers.Speaking about the all-party meetings summoned by Joginder Dayal and the Congress, he said that all political parties were out to cash in on farmers'' plight. He said that at this stage all-party meetings were an exercise in futility.He said that the issue of farmers should be left for farmers'' organisations to tackle.

Kanwaljit meets Tohra: Interestingly, when Tohra was addressing the press conference at Circuit House, suddenly out of nowhere appeared former Punjab finance minister Kanwaljit Singh.

Kanwaljit, however, clarified that he was only there to pay his regards to the veteran Akali leader, political differences apart. They sat together for about half an hour.

Talking to mediapersons at Tohra''s press conference, Kanwaljit demanded from the Centre an MSP of Rs 750 and a bonus of Rs 100 per quintal.

24,People fed up with INLD govt: Bhajan Lal,"KURUKSHETRA: Haryana Pradesh Congress Committee (HPCC) president Bhajan Lal on Wednesday said that all sections of society in the state were disenchanted with the present Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) government, and claimed that the Congress would sweep all the ten Lok Sabha seats and 80 out of the 90 assembly seats in the next elections.Addressing a massive Sadbhawana rally at the grounds of Sector 17 of HUDA here, Bhajan Lal said that there was a strong wave in favour of Congress and lakhs of people were attending the rallies being addressed by him after he took over as the president of the HPCC.Levelling serious charges of corruption against Chautala and his two sons, Bhajan Lal alleged that nothing moves in Haryana without bribe. He said that everyone in the state knew that Chautala had fixed rates for his visits to the houses of industrialists for taking tea, lunch or dinner.He accused the BJP-led NDA government of inflaming communal hatred in the country to secure votes as it had been left with no other issues.Strongly condemning the propaganda of the BJP and its allies that Sonia Gandhi was a foreigner and had no right to become the Prime Minister of the country, Bhajan Lal stated that BJP had forgotten that in Indian culture a married woman gets the name and rights of her husband.

Fernandes accused BJP's weak policies to tackle terrorism in the country especially in Jammu and Kashmir.

25,"Clash between farmers, harvesters averted in Raikot","LUDHIANA: The confrontation between the recently formed combine harvesters union of Raikot Assembly constituency and the farmers of Jhorraran village, over the contentious issue of paddy harvesting by combine operators of other areas, was averted in time due to police intervention.

Nonetheless, tension had reportedly been brewing over the issue in the villages of Mullanpur area. Notably, the farmers owning combine harvesters had formed a union in Mullanpur and elsewhere in the district last month with the motive to force farmers to get their paddy crop harvested by the union members at a rate higher, than what was charged by combine operators of other districts, where harvesting had ended earlier.

Under the banner of Guru Nanak Combine Union, the members had decided to bar outsiders from carrying out harvesting operations in the area. The farmers, however, found the idea unacceptable.

They said that they were free to engage services of anybody offering economical rates. Against per acre charges of Rs 400 by outsiders, the union had fixed the rate at Rs 500.

According to Jhorraran Sarpanch Sadhu Singh, they had to take police help when a Raikot union member, led by president Jagroop Singh, descended on the fields of Harmel Singh to coerce him to avail services of the union. On information, announcement was made on the public address system at the village gurdwara on Monday. Apprehending farmers ire, the union members hastily retreated, some even leaving their vehicles behind.

The situation could have turned worse, had the union members not relented, the Sarpanch said.

Raikot police station SHO Mohinder Kumar also confirmed the incident adding that the union had given in writing that they would not force anybody.

Though Ranjit Singh of Lalton village, the first one to hire Ferozepur-based operator Surjan Singh, when the combine harvesting started here on Wednesday, had not faced any problem from the union members of his village.

But tension was discernible with other farmers awaiting reaction of union members of this area. Farmers of Chhoti Lalton, Pamaal, Jhande, Kheri, Baddowal and Ghuman villages were reportedly ready to counter any move by the union to stop outsiders from operating in their areas. Since formation of the union, farmers of these villages had reportedly been mobilised to oppose the union moves.

""We have planned to inform each other in case the union members force any individual not to engage outsider operators,"" said Narvinder Singh of Lalton. About 500 acre of paddy was expected to be harvested by the outsiders, he added.

Similarly, Dalbir Singh of nearby Pamaali village had engaged Ajaib Singh of Mehadipur in Patiala district for his 25 acre paddy. Buoyed by Jhorraran incident, farmers of the area said they would not give in to coercive measures of the union.

The matter had been brought to the notice of the district administration, which reportedly assured farmers that they were free to hire services of anybody. No official was available for comments on account of holiday.

26,Mrinal Sen returns to IFFI with apolitical film,"NEW DELHI: Mrinal Sen returns to the International Film Festival after a long gap. And this time, the filmmaker who is known for many firsts in his film oeuvre, comes with another first of its kinds.

He completely redefines the parameters of political cinema by focussing on contemporary, chaotic, communal India by building a parallel world, seemingly untouched by the present scourge.

â€˜â€˜There is no war, no bigotry, no communal clashes in my film ( Aamar Bhuvan â€” My House), yet I am making a political film,â€™â€™ says Sen. This, he says, is the response of a filmmaker who is â€˜â€˜too confusedâ€™â€™ by the events the world over and realises that the only way to comment on them is to highlight the life of the small, sensible people who live out their lives with tenderness, sensitivity, tolerance and dignity, despite the day-to-day impediments.

The film was inspired by a news programme where, at the height of the Kargil war, a vegetable vendor in Islamabad expressed his views on the event.

When asked to comment on the war, he merely looked up and said it spelt Nuksaan (loss) and then went about his business of hawking potatoes.

â€˜â€˜Contemporary reality breaks and tears apart common people, yet they survive, they love. I wanted to highlight the quiet dignity of these people who donâ€™t want to talk about war and lose the magic in their daily life which exists despite the hardships,â€™â€™ says Sen.

Of course, Sen buffs wanted to know why an â€˜â€˜overtly political filmmakerâ€™â€™ had to make such a â€˜â€˜covertly politicalâ€™â€™ film when political comment was the order of the day. The filmmaker however sees it as a logical progression in his career.

â€˜â€˜I used to make strong political statements in my films when there was a lot of anger and hot air around. Today, I would like to stand in front of the mirror and introspect rather than point accusing fingers at others,â€™â€™ explains Sen.

Meanwhile, the cinema of the world section has been drawing a luke warm response with its mediocre quality.

But the winner seems to be the augmented film market section, another bold step by I&B minister Sushma Swaraj to transform the film business into a full-fledged industry.",NEW DELHI
