1,Pratapgarh incident still haunts Pramod,"KANPUR: Congress leader Pramod Tiwari is annoyed at his name being dragged into the recent scuffle between Lok Sabha Candidates from Pratapgarh Ratna Singh and Akshay Pratap Singh.

At a press conference held here on Friday, he said, ""How was it possible for a person under house arrest to be present at the site of the incident? And 17 other politicians were under house arrest on that day.""

Each candidate from Pratapgarh had a video camera, it the Election Commission must make the clippings public, he further said. ""The incident was an attempt by the state government to trap me. Video clippings will prove me innocent,"" he added.

On the party''s poll prospects, he said, that it would emerge definitely as number one. ""The Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and the Samajwadi Party (SP) were supporting the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) indirectly.

Though they do not exist outside the state, their head honchos were dreaming of becoming prime minister,"" he added. The BSP and the SP felt that government could not be framed without their support, he further added.

On the BJP he said, ""The aged Prime Minister has memory problems. Country needs a government which can decide on its own rather than looking up to United States of America."" He credited Rahul Gandhi with the improvement in Congress'' image. He appealed to people to vote for the party.

""Though the city needs a development fund, the SP and the BJP have failed to sanction it,"" he added. He held the Centre responsible for the closure of mills here. The Congress would try to revive the mills, he said.

2,HC indicts govt for mockery of poll process,"PATNA: The Patna High Court on Friday blamed Bihar director general of police for allowing some people to make a mockery of the election process, the rule of law and the courts.

""This is more a matter for the government (state) to see, and certainly an embarrassment for it, unless the government wanted it,"" the High Court order said, adding officials, including DMs and SPs of the districts, where absconders exercised their franchise, are to be proceeded against forthwith for having sided with such criminals.

Delivering order on two writ petitions against criminals contesting elections, a division Bench, comprising Chief Justice Ravi S Dhavan and Justice Shashank Kumar Singh took serious note of absconding Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) MLA Rama Singh, wanted by police of Bihar, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh and West Bengal in several criminal cases, casting his vote at a booth in Hajipur parliamentary constituency from where the national president of the LJP chief Ram Vilas Paswan is trying his luck, in the presence of police.

The Bench instructed the DGP to immediately arrest him.

The judges castigated the Bihar government for allowing an absconder to cast his vote and its failure to check the activities of prisoners, freely running election campaign from hospitals in judicial custody.

""This is enough to prove the connivance of the state government with such anti-social elements. This is embarrassing,"" the judges observed. In the case of those who are in lawful custody of the police but were ""encouraged"" for electioneering and allowed to hold ""durbars"" when deprived of their liberty, the Bench said such persons were disenfranchised and thus could not be candidates.

The election is over and now the state government is reporting that they have been sent behind bars. Perhaps ""the purpose"" is over. The damage has been done. Again the process of the election has been desecrated, the judges said. ""The EC will have to take all these factors into account whether such elections need to be countermanded or not. If the administration of the state government had to provide such favours to influential people in lawful police custody, then the best of medicare could have been provided within the confines of the jail.

â€œNo one says do not provide medical treatment, but do so within the walls of the jail. Such persons are entitled to the same treatment as other persons under lawful custody of the police. They are not entitled to luxury,"" the Bench suggested.

3,"Crime a bar to polls, says HC","PATNA/NEW DELHI: Seeking to bar undertrials and absconders from elections, the Patna High Court on Friday referred to Article 326 and said, ""Crime may mean conviction, and yet it may also be understood as criminality.""

But legal experts are unanimous that the high court''s order would be set aside.

Says constitutional expert P P Rao: ""The order is not a correct approach to law. Representation of People''s Act does not disqualify an undertrial from contesting. Only voting by anyone in jail is barred. For contesting only nomination paper has to be filed, which can be done even from jail.""

Former law minister and senior lawyer Shanti Bhushan agrees with Rao and gives example of how several senior leaders of NDA contested and won from jail after the Emergency.

""There is no legal provision to bar people in jail from contesting. George Fernandes, arrested for involvement in the Baroda Dynamite case, filed his nomination paper and had a landslide victory. I am sure the HC order would be reversed.""

But even the apex court, which had to deal with the issue of banning entry of criminals in the legislature, has more than once lobbed the issue back to Parliament for a possible legislation prohibiting law-breakers from becoming law-makers.

4,Krishna teaser irks thirsty Naidu govt,"TIRUPATI/HYDERABAD: Karnataka chief minister S M Krishna said on Friday that his government was willing to release drinking water to Andhra Pradesh.

The reason it had not done so already was that AP had not specified exactly how much it needs, he said in Tirupati.

Krishna said AP chief minister Chandrababu Naidu had written several letters to him seeking release of water from the Alamatti reservoir but in none of them had he been specific about the volume he needed and the district-wise requirement.

The Karnataka CM''s statement left AP ministers fuming. Minister for major irrigation Kadiam Srihari said the state government did specify its need; Naidu had asked for 25 tmc ft during a one-on-one with Krishna and had broached the subject as recently as two months ago.

Srihari said he was surprised at Krishna''s demand for district-wise requirement. ""Tomorrow he might ask how much water each household wants,"" he said.

5,It's back to work for five ministers,"HYDERABAD: The state Secretariat where administration had come to a stand still in the last two months since the code of conduct came into effect, witnessed some semblance of activity on Friday following lifting of the code of conduct in the state.

Though Chandrababu Naidu chose not to go to the Secretariat, about five ministers attended office on Friday afternoon and reviewed the ongoing projects and the drinking water shortage problem in Adilabad and other areas.

The sudden move of Election Commission to lift the code had raised several eye brows. Congress and TRS leaders were unhappy with this decision of the EC.

They feel that this would give leverage to TDP in ""manipulating"" information and would cause problems for the successor government to review any possible irregularities.

TDP spokesperson R Chandrashekar Reddy brushed aside opposition charges as a wild allegation and said that this move of EC would be a boon for those who were suffering from drought and shortage of drinking water.

""There is no question of any manipulation. TDP is coming back to power and we don''t have to indulge in such cheap tactics. That is Congress culture not our''s,"" he said.

But opposition leaders say this could provide a chance for any government facing defeat to indulge in such acts.

Among those who went to the Secretariat were health minister Kodela Sivaprasad Rao, excise minister T Seetaram, Roads and buildings minister T Nageswara Rao, tourism minister T Srinivas Yadav and Panchayat Raj minister N Janardhan Reddy.

""Most of the ministers are likely to visit their chambers on Monday,"" said a secretariat employee.

8,Joining 'secular' Govt to be decided after polls: Raja,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: CPI national secretary D Raja on Saturday said the question of his party joining a possible Congress-led secular government at the Centre would be decided after the elections and that the immediate task on hand was to dislodge the BJP-led government.

""There is a big if. We will assess the situation emerging after the elections. It is a hypothetical question at this juncture,"" Raja, who arrived here for campaigning for the party candidate P K Vasudevan Nair, told a TV channel.

""One thing is sure. The primary task before the Left is to dislodge the BJP.After that, along with other Left parties, we will explore the possibility of setting up a secular-democratic government,"" the CPI leader said.
