0,Omar demands President's rule in Gujarat,"BHADERWAH, Jammu: Irked by the Centre''s reported move to hold Jammu and Kashmir Assembly election under governor''s rule, National Conference President Omar Abdullah on Sunday demanded imposition of President''s rule in Gujarat.

Addressing a public meeting here, Omar said he and his father Farooq Abdullah never supported governor''s rule in J and K as there is no such provision in the Constitution that to ensure free and fair polls governor''s rule was necessary.

""For this they have to amend the Constitution,"" Omar said, adding, if free and fair elections are not possible under NC''s rule, how can elections be fair under the rule of Modi''s government in Gujarat.

Demanding the imposition of governor''s rule in Gujarat Omar, who is also Union Minister of State for External Affairs, termed that the law and order situation is worse in Gujarat than in J and K.

Omar said, ""we are not afraid of contesting elections under governor''s rule as we have shown it by wining earlier also and if necessary, we will prove it again.""

Holding Pakistan responsible for the massacre at Kasim Nagar in Jammu, Omar without naming BJP alleged that communal flare is being spread for taking political mileage by defaming NC and holding its government responsible for the Saturday''s killings.

Reacting to the incident after visiting the spot on Sunday morning, Omar said that the actual victims are demanding compensation, rehabilitation and proper medicare, but some political parties are finding it appropriate by demanding the ouster of NC government.

Criticising JKPCC''s chief Ghulam Nabi Azad''s statement asking Hurriyat to first get freedom from NC''s rule, Omar referred this stance of Congress as the most opportunistic, adding that the probable postponement of the October Assembly polls to April on the plea to involve Hurriyat and other separatist organisation in the elections is a lame excuse and aimed at giving a set back to moral of NC cadre.

1,LJP bid to get even with Rly minister,"PATNA: While the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance government at the Centre has decided to reconsider the reorganisation of the Eastern Railway (ER), the Lok Janashakti Party (LJP) of former Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan has utilised the occasion to highlight its political fight with rail minister Nitish Kumar and also score points against him.

The LJP has accused Kumar of having complicated the matter related to the creation of East Central (EC) railway by taking it to the Cabinet for reconsideration. The party has also accused defence minister George Fernandes of changing his stand on the issue like a â€˜chameleonâ€™, when he suggested on Saturday that the matter be sent to the Cabinet for reconsideration.

The LJP reaction has come in the form of a joint statement of its state president Narendra Singh, LJP legislature party leader Ram Sewak Hazari, chairman of the parliamentary board Pashupati Kumar Paras and MLA Rama Kishore Singh. The state LJP leadership maintained that the Cabinet, in 1996 and 1998, had already decided to create the EC railway on the initiative of Paswan.

3,VHP protest killing of Hindus in Jammu,"KANPUR: In an immediate reaction to the brutal killing of Hindus in Jammu, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad has decided to launch a nationwide protest to press their demand for the division of Jammu and Kashmir into three parts.

International general secretary of the VHP Praveen Togadia directed activists of the Parishad to raise their voice in the entire country against increasing assault on Hindus in Kashmir. He also demanded the immediate removal of the ruling Farooq Abdullah government in the state in order to restore peace.

Media executive of the party Madan Malviya talking to Times News Network on Sunday said that Togadia, in a telephonic chat with local VHP leaders, directed them to stage demonstrations at the district level to protest against the cold blooded murder of Hindu families in Jammu on Saturday night.

He said Hindus would not tolerate such heinous acts anymore and blamed the Union government for overlooking the demands of the VHP to trifurcate the state to maintain peace.

4,Rajnath to party workers: Mount pressure on CM,"LUCKNOW: The new BJP general secretary Rajnath Singh on Sunday exhorted party workers to mount pressure on Mayawati government if it failed to follow the â€˜coalition dharmaâ€™.

Ironically, Rajnathâ€™s call came close on party state president Vinay Katiyarâ€™s directive for not holding any dharna and demonstration or issuing statement against the coalition government, in a clear sign of contradiction between the party central and state units over dealing with the Mayawati government in Uttar Pradesh. While the state leaders favour â€˜go slowâ€™, the central leadership seems to be in a hurry to take on Mayawati once presidential poll is over.

â€œKaryakartaon ke maan, samman aur swabhimaan ko agar chot pahuchti hai to apni takat ka ahsaas kara denge (If workers are not respected, we would show our strength),â€� announced Singh on his first arrival from Delhi after becoming the party general secretary.

To instil confidence and restore self-respect of party workers, he asked them as well as party ministers to mount pressure on the Mayawati government if it failed to follow the coalition dharma, issuing a warning to the chief minister Mayawati to mend her ways in dealing with its allies.

Significantly, the new BJP general secretary also issued a veiled threat to the BSP saying that party could have formed its own government, if needed, but the party central leadership decided otherwise.

The former UP chief minister was also highly critical of the Maya governance and her dictatorial style of functioning. Referring to distribution of free text-books and Group C recruitments, Singh pointed out that the coalition governmentâ€™s policies and programmes were giving the message that it was working for only one section of the society. He also asked Mayawati to review her decisions in this regard

â€œCaste discrimination should not be reflected in the governmentâ€™s decisions, policies and programmes. The government must review its decision on distribution of free text-books and get the stay vacated from the court on Group C recruitments,â€� he asked.

The former UP chief minister pointed out that distribution of free text-books was not a big issue that it would empty governmentâ€™s coffers or create any financial crisis.

Singh also drew the attention of Mayawati government on revenue realistaion drive despite drought-like conditions prevailing in several parts of the state. â€œI hope that the government would stop revenue realisation with immediate effect in drought-prone districts.â€�

5,CCB forum to meet ministers,"LUCKNOW: The City Cooperative Bank Depositorâ€™s forum on Sunday decided to meet all the ministers of the state government and ask them to come out with some help for the revival of the bank.

On the other hand, the CCB administration has decided to hold talks with the UP Financial Corporation and other institutional depositors to persuade them to agree to put in their money for a fixed period so that the bank could be revived.

Though efforts to revive the CCB has received a major boost after the RBI teamâ€™s visit, the basic problem faced by the administration is that they do not have enough financial recourses to bail out the bank. There are plans which can take care of non-performing assets to the tune of Rs 36 crore with the help of individual and institutional depositors. Some money, which was given as loan and advances by the bank, can also be recovered in a short span.

However, the bank will still need around Rs 15-20 crore to start business afresh.

And for that, help will have to come from the state government, the prime minister and other banks/cooperative banks in the form of grant, aid or soft loan, or even some help from Joharis.

At a meeting of the depositorsâ€™ forum, they decided that the only hope for the bankâ€™s revival was financial help from the state or the central government.

6,Legislators to follow party line: Prez poll,"LUCKNOW: With virtually no possibility of miracles in the presidential poll on Monday, the members of the electoral college from Uttar Pradesh are likely to cast their votes on expected lines.

All the major political parties, both from the National Democratic Alliance and, now defunct, Peopleâ€™s Front, have already pledged their support for the likely winner APJ Abdul Kalam against the Left parties candidate Capt Lakshmi Sahgal.

In Mondayâ€™s poll, Abdul Kalam is sure to notch up votes of Samajwadi Party, Congress and some independents MLAs apart from the the BSP-BJP alliance legislators.

The Samajwadi Party and Congress have 142 and 25 MLAs respectively in the House of 403. Along with these, a couple of independent MLAs, till now maintaining equi-distance from both the formations, may also support Kalam at the poll, said a BJP spokesman.

On the other hand, the Left parties nominee Sahgal may count on the support from two CPM, one SJP( Ram Govind Choudhary) and one Janata Party MLA (Sanjay Garg). Kaushal Kishore, a former CPI leader who won the assembly poll from Malihabad as a Nationalist Communist Party candidate, has also pledged support for Kalam. The vote value of each MLA of Uttar Pradesh is 208, the highest among legislators.

Most of the political parties have either held the meeting of their legislative wing or would hold it on Monday morning itself to guide their MLAs to vote for the candidate of their preference.

7,"Govt, teachers clash over conduct code","LUCKNOW: Minister proposes, teachers dispose. The state government and teaching community appear to be on a collision course over the issue of a code of conduct for the secondary education teachers.

Education minister Om Prakash Singh advocates a set of rules governing the conduct of teachers in the schools and outside as well, which he believes would improve the quality of secondary education and would make teachers a guiding force for society.

Teachers, on the other hand, have out rightly rejected the proposal saying, â€œconduct can be improved through â€˜self evaluationâ€™ and not by imposition of rulesâ€�. â€œBesides,â€� they point out, â€œpoliticians should first have a code of conduct for themselves, before designing one for teachersâ€�.

Education minister OP Singh told Times News Network that there is already a code of conduct in place for the university and degree college teachers and hence it is not a big deal if there is one for the secondary education teachers too.

The idea is to streamline the quality of education, making the teachers realise that they have to take regular classes, keep away from activities which bring a bad name to the teaching community and above all, act as role models for their students.

He said, â€œthe philosophy behind all the education reforms proposed by me, is to raise the quality of secondary education in the state,â€� and added, â€œa mere 40 per cent result in the UP Board High School examinations is a matter of grave concern for usâ€�.

Although the minister has given the assurance that the code of conduct will be implemented after a consensus is arrived at, teachers however, are presenting a united front in opposing the implementation of such a code, which they describe as yet another instrument in the hands of the government and college managements to harass them.

Devi Dayal Shastri, leader, UP Madhyamik Shikshak Sangh (Sharma group) and MLC from Lucknow, said that the code of conduct would not be appropriate for teachers as it projects the picture that the teachers are at fault and the government is out to rein them in.

â€œInstead, the teachers should themselves conduct a self evaluation,â€� he suggested. In this regard, a seminar on â€˜Code of Conduct versus Self Evaluationâ€™, is being organised at KKC College on July 18.

President, UP Madhyamik Shiksha Sangh (Pandey group) also decried the move to implement such a code on the teachers, saying that a code of conduct already exists in the community and that the government should keep away from â€˜teachingâ€™ teachers about what they should do.

â€œThings like good conduct, inspiration and motivation come from within and cannot be imposed by the government,â€� he pointed out. However, the ministerâ€™s proposal has received overwhelming support from college authorities and principals.

8,Only Centre can ban political party: Jana,"CHENNAI: A ban on a registered political party like the MDMK, as contemplated upon by the Tamil Nadu government would not be possible either under Unlawful Activities (prevention) Act 1967 or under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (POTA), as it could only be decided upon by the Centre, said Union law minister Jana Krishnamurthy on Sunday.

Talking to reporters here, Krishnamurthy observed: â€˜â€˜The right to ban a party lies with the Centre and any state government wishing to ban such an organisation should refer the matter to the Centre.â€™â€™

Referring to chief minister J Jayalalithaaâ€™s threats to ban the MDMK for its continued open support to the LTTE even after the arrest of the party chief Vaiko and eight others under POTA, Krishnamurthy clarified: â€˜â€˜So far we have not received any request from the Tamil Nadu government in this regard. If at all it is sent, it will be addressed to the home ministry.â€™â€™

Though he felt that the arrest of Vaiko and eight others was legally correct under POTA, the state government could not ban a political party but can only recommend it to the Centre and the Union home ministry would consider such a recommendation.

Asked if following the arrest of Vaiko, POTA would be amended to prevent its misuse, Krishnamurthy, pointed out that there were enough provisions to safeguard the Act against misuse. â€˜â€˜That is why Vaiko has said he will legally challenge his arrest,â€™â€™ he added.

Whether Centre would help Vaiko, a committed ally, Krishnamurthy said that it was for the party leadership to decide the BJPâ€™s stand.

He dismissed former Union minister Maneka Gandhiâ€™s statement that the Centre could not allow the arrest of Vaiko on one hand and yet retain two MDMK ministers in the cabinet.

9,Vaiko’s arrest pointer to holes in terror law,"NEW DELHI: During the hey-days of terrorism in Punjab, some youths were picked up by the state police and detained under the then anti-terror law â€” the highly misused Tada (Terrorists and Disruptive Activities Act).

They were convicted by the designated court for shouting pro-Khalistani slogans. However, they were acquitted by the Supreme Court which ruled that mere raising of sepratist slogans, favouring the creation of Khalistan, could not be construed as an act of terrorism.

While replacing Tada with Pota, the law-makers , perhaps, did not take into account certain areas where the law could be misused , thus defeating the purpose of an urgent legislation.

When it was debated and discussed, doubts had been expressed about its massive potential for misuse, particularly to settle political scores.

â€˜â€˜We always said that Pota will be used against oneâ€™s political opponent who may differ with the ruling party on certain crucial issues,â€™â€™ said Congress MP R K Anand. The noted lawyer said though the arrest of MDMK MP Vaiko was within Section 21 of Pota, it could not be justified at any cost. â€˜â€˜After all the purpose of having Pota is not to go for witch-hunting but to arrest those who are actively involved in the acts of terrorism and secessionismâ€™â€™.

BJP president M Venkaiah Naidu has also said that Vaikoâ€™s arrest â€˜â€˜was undesirable and unwarranted, as it would send a wrong signal about the legislationâ€™â€™. Intrestingly, both Tamil Nadu chief minister Jayalalitha and Vaikoâ€™s party had supported the Pota.

Even Akali Dal (M) leader Simran Jit Singh Mann who was arrested under Tada for allegedly indulging in terrorism, is an MP now.

â€˜â€˜The success of Indian democracy lies in the fact that someone like Mann, with whom we all disagree, is in Parliamentâ€™â€™, a senior BJP functionary said.

10,EVMs to be used in J&K elections,"JAMMU: In its effort to ensure free and fair elections in Jammu and Kashmir, the government is bringing in electronic voting machines (EVMs) for the coming assembly elections. EVMs have been introduced in the state for the first time.

And with elections just a few months away, the administration has also started educating political leaders on the use of EVMs. On Wednesday, representatives of various political parties were called in at the office of deputy commissioner Rohit Kansal.

Representatives of most political parties, including the ruling National Conference, the Congress, the BJP, the Peoples Democratic Party and the CPI attended the meeting, where the working of a machine was demonstrated.

All their doubts regarding the use of the machines were clarified. Kansal explained to them that one EVM could handle voting for up to 16 candidates. He told them that mobile teams comprising computer engineers would be available throughout the state to meet any technical snag that the machine may develop, he said.

Kansal further said that even after developing a snag, the machines would not lose the votes polled till that time.

11,Opposition plans to attack govt on killings,"NEW DELHI: The government is likely to face a severe assault from a combined opposition on the ghastly Jammu killings during the monsoon session of Parliament opening on Monday.

In informal consultations among senior Opposition leaders, it was decided that the governmentâ€™s repeated failure to prevent terrorist incursions from across the border would be raised in a big way. CPM parliamentary party leader Somnath Chatterjee on Sunday exchanged views with Congress deputy leader in the Lok Sabha Shivraj Patil on the issues to be raised.

Congress president Sonia Gandhi, in a statement, condemned the killings and said that such acts of barbarism showed the desperation of the perpetrators. She called upon the government to take stringent measures to deal with the challenge of terrorism and protect innocent lives.

The CPM also asked the Centre and the Jammu and Kashmir government to take effective measures to check terrorist activity, arrest the culprits and plug the loopholes in the security measures.

However, the government will get respite from any Opposition attack on Monday since the Lok Sabha will be adjourned after passing obituary references. The focus will be on voting to elect the new President.

12,Opposition gears up to take on govt,"HYDERABAD: Opposition parties, barring the BJP, met on Sunday and put finishing touches to their plan to put the government on the mat in the monsoon session of the Assembly beginning on Monday.

Among the issues they decided to highlight is the resignation of labour minister S Devaiah, for his alleged involvement in the murder of his former driver. â€œDevaiah was forced to quit on moral grounds after his name cropped up in the case. The ruling party, however, did not apply the same yardstick of morals and ethics to ministers Kodela Sivaprasada Rao and Rama Subba Reddy. Why? was it because he is a dalit,â€� Congress Legislature Party leader Y S Rajasekhara Reddy asked.

Rajasekhara Reddy, who convened the meeting of the Opposition parties at the CLP office on Sunday said the Opposition had identified eight key areas of concern.

Among them were the acute shortage of power and unscheduled loadshedding in the rural areas, the drought in many parts of the state, the criminal antecedents of many ministers, the chief ministerâ€™s unfulfilled promises and the scholarship scandal.

The Opposition will pressure the goverment to extend the session from 10 working days to 15. The meeting was attended among others by CPI(M) legislator N Narasimhaiah and Telangana Sadhana Samiti (TSS) MLA R Ravindranath Reddy.

Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen floor leader Asaduddin Owaisi could not attend because of the illness of his father, MP Sultan Salahuddin Owaisi. Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS) leader K Chandrasekhara Rao too skipped the meeting on health grounds. Both have conveyed their support for the decisions taken at the floor coordination meeting, Reddy said.

Asked why the talks with the Peopleâ€™s War did not crop up in the discussions and was not among the issues shortlisted by the Opposition, he said: â€œThis would come up any way. But the government is not committed to the negotiation process. The continuing encounters in different districts, even while the talks are on amply reflects this,â€� he said.

13,Poor power adds to farmers’ woes,"HYDERABAD: It is a multiple assault on farmers of the state. Even as they battle drought-like conditions with nearly no irrigation, the only other option of using groundwater had been ruled out, thanks to the extremely poor power supply for agricultural pumpsets.

The state has more than 20 lakh agricultural pumpsets that are supposed to be provided nine hours of power supply in a day. Though the government claims that it is doing so, the fact remains that demand for power from the farm sector accounts for nearly 40 per cent â€” 54 million units â€” of the total demand in the state that hovers around 135 million units a day. The current generation in the state is about 120 mu.

Asked if the agriculture department has taken up the issue with the energy department, agriculture minister V Shobhanadreeswara Rao said â€œI cannot force them (Transco) as it is already reeling under energy supply crisisâ€™â€™.

Rao said the main source of power supply for the farm sector are the hydel sources. But, with the water level in the Sirsailam reservoir going below the maximum dry level, hydel power generation has nearly come to a standstill. The minister said except Chittor, Srikakulam, Vizianagram and Visakhapatnam, sowing of paddy in other districts has been delayed because of the lack of rains.

AP Transco director (commercial) P M K Gandhi said there was no reduction in power supply to the agriculture sector.

However, the supply of six hours in the day time and three hours during the nights, has become a â€œlittle irregularâ€™â€™.

21,BJP closely monitoring developments in Cong,"Ahmedabad: With the strong possibility of former chief minister Shankersinh Vaghela being appointed as the GPCC president with an eye on the Assembly, there is both apprehension and hope in the Bharatiya Janata Party circles, who have been closely monitoring the developments in the Congress.

The apprehension is because Vaghela is a popular figure and the Congress under him is expected to put up a better show. The hope is that Vaghela is not an ""original Congressman"" and therefore his elevation may lead to some dissent within the Congress.

""If Vaghela leads the Congress, we would be more cautious with our election-related plans, including the selection of candidates and their prospects. At the same time the BJP and the Sangh Parivar would work overtime to trounce an arch rival who had betrayed us,"" said a senior BJP partyman. He added, ""The ripples caused in the Congress would indirectly help us and we would not leave any stone unturned to teach the Congress a lesson. The Congress is already in bad shape and divided into various camps.""

Senior RSS leader Mukundrao Devbhanker said, ""It hardly matters whether it is Chaudhary or Vaghela. We would continue our crusade against the Congress policy of appeasing the minorities.""

A section of the BJP, which perceives Vaghela as a threat to the party, feels that it would help unite the opponents of Modi, mainly the Keshubhai Patel camp which has support of some ministers, including Haren Pandya.

BJP circles are equally happy with the exit of Amarsinh Chaudhary, who enjoyed the faith and confidence of the tribals that accounted for 17 per cent of the state''s population. The BJP government has initiated a slew of measures for the welfare of the Adivasis as recommended by the Bhuria Commission and the turn of events will drift them towards the BJP in the elections, is what most party insiders feel.
