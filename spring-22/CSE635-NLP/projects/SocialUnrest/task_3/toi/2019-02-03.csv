8,Oppn asks government to withdraw ESMA,"thiruvananthapuram: opposition leader in the kerala assembly v.s. achuthanandan, on sunday demanded that the government withdraw the essential service maintenance act, invoked to deal with the proposed indefinite stir by employees and teachers from february 6. the government should restore their curtailed benefits and create a peaceful atmosphere, he told reporters here. the policies being adopted were similar to those during the emergency period, he alleged. achuthanandan said the decision to scrap benefits like leave surrender was an attempt to divert people's attention from administrative `failures'. the government, instead of concentrating on tax collections to increase revenue, was trying to `snatch away' employees' rights. justifying the proposed struggle, he said the staff and teachers were not agitating for any fresh demands. ""they are only demanding continuation of existing benefits"". he also criticised the decision to waive turnover tax of big businessmen for rs 90 crore. criticising the rs 210 crore relief package for farmers, he said a government which could not implement even a portion of the rs 500 crore earmarked for them in the budget, had made another announcement.

9,Rampura Phool’s rural voters fear violence on polling day,"bathinda: rural voters of the most sensitive constituency of bathinda district, rampura phool, having a share of 108 of the 142 polling booths declared sensitive, sense trouble on the day of polling. they have reason to fear that the war of words between state power minister and shiromani akali dal (sad) candidate sikander singh malooka and dissident sad leader gurpreet singh kangar, contesting as an independent, could spill into violence as the d-day draws near. a police party had to be called on sunday at guru kothe ke village to avert a clash between the supporters of the two leaders.addressing a rally at the village, kangar alleged that malooka's supporters had threatened his supporters of ''dire consequences if they took part in the election process. the speeches of kangar, who has been addressing about 15 rallies a day, are directed against the power minister. he has been accusing malooka of misusing power by implicating people of the area in false cases. ''i promise i will provide justice to these people if voted to power, he has been saying. a number of villagers of malooka, guru kothe ke, mehraj and dayal mirza whom the times of india spoke to on sunday, are so apprehensive of violence taking place on the polling day, that they have decided against exercising their voting right. rampura phool will witness a close triangular contest between malooka, kangar and congress candidate harbans singh sidhu, who is expecting to reap dividends out of the showdown between malooka and kangar.the campaign of political parties veers around issues which are strikingly different: the excesses committed by the police, and the provision of poppy husk and illicit liquor. candidates have been promising that if they are voted to power, people would be allowed to distil liquor and produce poppy husk, without having to fear the police. addressing villagers of guru kothe ke on sunday, kangar said that on winning the election he would ensure that nobody is harassed for possessing illicit liquor and poppy husk. however, kangar told the times of india that he had said this to hamper the power minister's campaign.'' malooka has been misleading voters by telling them that mine being a family of liquor contractors, i would come down heavily on illicit liquor if i win the election. i had to make such a statement to counter malooka's remark, he said.

10,‘Govt policies driving farmers to suicide’,"hyderabad: in a sharp criticism of the state government, economist and jnu professor utsa patnaik on sunday said that contrary to public opinion that farmers were committing suicides due to crop failures, in actuality, it were the government's policies which had forced them to take the extreme step. participating in a seminar organised by the cpm state unit at sundarayya vignana kendram here on sunday, patnaik also dismissed the government's claims that payment of compensations would further fuel the suicidal tendencies among the distressed farmers. more than 700 farmers had committed suicide in andhra pradesh in the last five years due to the unprecedented crisis that has gripped the farm sector over the past few years. this is a result of the government's encouragement to private sector in the supply of seeds and pesticides. with the private entrepreneurs supplying spurious seeds and pesticides, the crops failed forcing farmers to commit suicides, he said. moreover, the government's zeal to follow the liberalisation policies as imposed by the international funding agencies like the world bank at the time of granting loans to farmers had also made them (the farmers) feel insecure, she said. utsa patnaik also expressed concern about the decreasing allocations to irrigation, rural development and other key areas of rural development. cpm state secretary b v raghavulu, termed as unfortunate the government's indifference towards the farmers' suicides. taking exception to chief minister n chandrababu's advice to farmers to shift to commercial crops, he said that suicides were more in the areas where farmers had shifted to commercial crops.

12,Gap between govt’s claims and intentions,"hyderabad: despite the government's claim of improving the facilities in the higher education sector, it does not appear to be interested in increasing the allocations made to this segment during the next financial year. according to the budget estimates released in the draft budget document for the next financial year, the plan budget of some segments of higher education like collegiate education has been reduced, while a meagre increase has been proposed for intermediate education. interestingly, the government has forwarded a proposal for implementation of a comprehensive college development project to the uk-based department for international development (dfid), seeking an assistance of rs 870 crore, instead of making any allocations by itself. while the plan estimate for intermediate education stood at rs 38.57 crore last financial year, it has been proposed to increase it to rs 38.76 crore during the next year. the non-plan expenditure which was pegged at rs 222.23 crore during the previous year, is proposed to be hiked to rs 229.98 crore. in respect of collegiate education, the proposed budget estimate under the plan is rs 2.98 crore as against the rs 3.13 crore of the previous year, while the non-plan estimate stood at rs 342.79 crore against rs 331 crore of last year. similarly, the plan allocation for ap state council for higher education has been cut down from rs 12.65 lakh to rs 6.58 lakh, while the non-plan estimate for the sector stood at rs 19.63 lakh as against rs 18.59 lakh of the previous year. on the other hand, the planned allocation for the universities is proposed to be at rs 60.99 crore as against the previous year's rs 59.50 crore, and the non-plan allocation has been raised from rs 180.03 crore to rs 184.54 crore, according to the strategy paper released by the government.

13,Discrepancies in MCH elections vote counting,"hyderabad: more than a week after the announcement of results for the mayoral elections, the mch authorities are yet to furnish data on the ward-wise number of votes secured by each of the 57 mayoral candidates. though the mch authorities have been claiming that the figures are ready, sources in the mch said the officials are puzzled over the different figures they received on the total polling in each ward for the mayor. in most wards, the total votes polled for division-level candidates do not match with the total votes for mayoral candidates. however, despite the discrepancies in the data, the mch authorities have announced the results both for the mayor and corporators. for instance, in the mayoral election, the total number of valid votes polled, as claimed by the returning officer, was 11,08,235. but a simple addition of votes secured by all 57 candidates shows a difference of 247 votes. similarly, the total valid votes polled for corporators were 10,91,158, whereas, the mch claims the figure to be 10,92,624.this shows a clear difference of 1,466 votes. though these votes are neither in favour of nor against any political party, they prove the blunders committed during the counting of votes, giving rise to suspicions that the figures were manipulated. in the ward-wise result, the mch officials have treated the wrong calculations as the official figures. for instance, in the dabeerpura ward, the total votes polled by all eight candidates were 9,730, but this was shown as 10,330. in the chandulal baradari ward, the total valid votes polled, as mentioned by the mch were 5,945. but the simple addition of votes secured by all four candidates takes the total to 7,683. interestingly, the difference of 1,738 votes has been mentioned as 'invalid votes'. similar mistakes have been committed in 14 other wards in the city. it is learnt that the aggregate of the actual vote figures collected from each of the 100 returning officers could be entirely different from what has already been released by the mch. meanwhile, returning officer j c sharma has gone on long leave since the announcement of results on january 25 without providing the ward-wise results to all mayoral candidates. according to assistant ro dr g malsur, though the figures are ready, the data cannot be given to the candidates until the returning officer returns from leave.

14,Scarred for life he awaits govt dole,"ahmedabad: help reaches last to those who require it the most. this principle of lop-sided justice is epitomised in the case of 50-year-old jakrabhai of bhachau who sustained one of the most frightening injuries in the january 26 earthquake but still waits in vain for a disability compensation. one eye is all that remains on the badly mutilated surface that was once jakrabhai's face. as the wall of his house collapsed on his back, he was pushed into an iron-grate with burning coals where his forehead, cheeks, lips and nose melted in a matter of seconds, leaving him with a grotesque disfigurement. jakrabhai has practically remained incarcerated in the burns ward of the civil hospital with his face totally swathed in bandages since the last one year. he has undergone a series of reconstructive surgeries in the past 12 months and will continue to do so for the next three years, but the fact is that his disability is 100 per cent. but apparently his misery is not enough to prompt government officials to release his disability compensation of rs 50,000. ""i've not got any help so far,"" mumbles jakrabhai like a robot from between a bagful of skin-flaps attached on his mouth that will be surgically be sculpted into lips later on. jakrabhai's son pravin claims that the family has submitted the 100 per cent disability certificate with the ddo, but the person concerned is fighting shy to sign the release order for the compensation. ""there's one mr saiyad whose signature is all that is required to release the money but he says we had filled in the application late and now he can't sign it and the same will have to be represented to the state government. when we asked him to return the certificate so that we could personally present our case to the government, he didn't cooperate. we don't really understand what's happening,"" says pravin, who has had to leave his job in a computer-stationery shop in mumbai to be at his ailing father's side ever since the tragedy struck. needless to say, the family is under great financial strain and has been forced to meet ends by borrowing money from family, friends and money-lenders. ""all kind of relief from the government has curiously bypassed our family. the doctors here are like gods who are giving me free treatment but the shuttling between bhachau and ahmedabad and living expenses incurred at the hospital are becoming difficult to bear with no source of income,"" confides jakrabhai. he is also worried about his daughter's impending marriage that was slated on january 28, 2001, but had to be postponed to this year. interestingly, jakrabhai was supposed to have come to ahmedabad this january 26, but he chose to forego his treatment for a while. ""there were rumours of an impending quake on january 26. i chose to remain in bhachau because there's nothing left to fall ... i live in a tent. here, the civil hospital might have crumbling down. i didn't want to take any risk,"" he adds.

15,Adivasi farmer killed in smuggling case,"ahmedabad: tension mounted in vyara and mahuva areas of surat district after the alleged murder of an adivasi farm labourer on saturday afternoon by some six persons, including beat guards attached with the state forest department who suspected him of being involved in the kherwood smuggling racket, which has put officials and political leaders of the area in a tizzy. the incident occurred after a truck laden with the protected kherwood was seized while being smuggled out of vyara. police fired four rounds on saturday when residents of valwada village attacked them with stones during the inquest on the body of the deceased, and another fir was filed against the mobsters for attacking the police at mahuva police station. the incident occurred just after the forest department officials of the surat range intercepted a truck (gj 7 y 682) smuggling two-and-a-half tonnes of kherwood (used in 'gutkha') from the forests. different interpretations of the incident by the forest and police officials have led to almost clashes between the two departments causing home minister gordhan zadaphia and state forest minister daulatbhai desai to rush to the spot to take stock of the situation. the main accused in this case, balubhai kothiya patel, was arrested late on saturday night and the police have identified four other beat guards as the accused in this case. according to dysp (headquarters) c p dalal, ""balubhai and five other beat guards went to baheda raipura village in vyara taluka at around 1 pm where chandubhai vanmalidas gamit was irrigating a sugarcane field, and suspecting him of having stolen wood, they started beating him up."" ""they demanded that he reveal the names of the kherwood thieves,"" said dalal. his brother, kanchanbhai vanmalidas gamit, lodged a complaint saying that patel, who is a forest guard, and five others began beating chandubhai in an attempt to elicit information. apparently, they dragged and clobbered him and dumped him at the valwada bus station in mahuva taluka where he was found dead, and a case of murder was lodged against patel and five others. when contacted, a senior forest official of surat range told tnn that the officials had received information about this truck which they intercepted on saturday, but the truckers managed to escape and chandubhai, who was one of them, was caught and interrogated at the anawal forest checkpost. ""in fact, balubhai recognised him and declared him innocent and then he was let to go, after which chandubhai decided to walk down from anawal to valwada where he had a glass of water and then collapsed and was found dead,"" says the official. the news spread in the village, and when police reached the spot and were conducting the panchnama on the body, the local residents, suspecting that the police would take the sides of the foresters, began pelting stones at the policemen where two dysps and a circle police inspector were injured. the police then opened fire from their service revolvers,"" said dalal. according to the senior forest official, the villagers were suspected of having cornered some of the kherwood, and thus did not want the forest officers to enter the village. a case of rioting and attempt to murder was lodged at the mahuva police station against a mob of 400 persons, of which 10 were arrested on the spot, dalal added. the beat guards, who are now on the run, have been identified as dinesh, vaghela, naik and bharat. police sub-inspector m a vala is investigating the case.

""the day is not far off when coffee growers in debt commit suicide,"" he said. aiyappa urged the elected representatives of kodagu district to help coffee growers. the elected representatives have not taken any steps to organise meetings or other action plans to save the growers who are now neck-deep in economic crisis, he regretted. a host of organisations -- the karnataka planters' association, united planters' association of south india, coorg planters' association, karnataka coffee growers' association, small growers' association, siddapur and napoklu, murnad growers' union and many others -- have declared support for the february 18 rally. on the bandh call given by the coorg national council on february 14, aiyappa said discussions will be held with cnc secretary-general n u nachappa to postpone the bandh and support their rally on february 18. he said the district chamber of commerce has assured support to the cause as the traders were also facing problems due to the low coffee prices. the action committee has demanded the government to waive loans taken by the coffee growers, to install meters to irrigation pumpsets, fixing of 3 paise per unit of electricity consumed by irrigation pumpsets, establishment of corpus fund, 50 per cent subsidy on fertilisers, increasing import duty on coffee up to 200 per cent, introduction of coffee retention scheme, popularising coffee in armed forces and railways and abolition of agriculture income tax. action committee president m w aiyappa, arun machaiah, nanda uthaiah, shanth appaiah, sadu poonacha, girish ganapathi, manu ganapathy, ravindra, b n prakash and krishna kumar were present at the press conference.

19,"If not rally cars, salt-laden trucks will keep raising dust","ahmedabad: the dust raised by the state government giving its consent to a car rally on february 10 inside the wild ass sanctuary in the little rann of kutch may not settle with the rallyists not driving through it, but visiting it as 'tourists'. while the 70-odd cars and support vehicles of the rally may have been prevented from racing through a 89-km stretch for two hours, at least 300 or more trucks and over 100 other vehicles continue plying through the length and breadth of the sanctuary the year round - all without permission! this illegal traffic plying inside its 5,000-sq-km salty expanse, declared a wild ass sanctuary in 1973, will never cease thanks to the salt industries that have 'encroached' on land inside the little rann. they will keep raising dust, keep disturbing, chasing and killing many of the wild ass, but there is no one to stop or monitor them. and this, despite the fact that the indian wild ass (equs hemionus khur) is one of the four endangered sub-species of the wild ass and the rann is home to 3,000 of them. if gir is recognised for being the last abode of the asiatic lion, the little rann is yet to receive that recognition from the government. ""this animal (wild ass) is as important as the lion in conservation value,"" says principal chief conservator of forests sanat chavan. the area has been identified by the international union for conservation of nature (iucn) as a bio-sphere reserve. but, the forest department has only three offices and a staff of 30 to man the expanse and 250 adjoining villages. its neglect becomes apparent when compared to gir. the latter, spread over an area less than a third of the rann, about 1,400 sq km, has a manpower of over 1,000! chavan agrees that ""not enough importance has been given to the wild ass...it is high time efforts are made to protect them"". what then is preventing the forest department from protecting the sanctuary from encroachments and traffic? ""over the years, the final notification of the sanctuary has not been issued. it is located in five districts and every district has given permission for starting salt works, despite protests by the forest department,"" he says. congress mla urvashi devi, who has supported the cause of conservation of the rann, says, ""the forest department cannot allow all the vehicles to go inside at the same time. there cannot be more than 10 vehicles and 30 people inside at any given time, if we go by standard wildlife practice."" leading hotelier jehangir r j cama scoffs at the suggestion that the rally has been organised to promote motorsports and tourism and says the event is more commercially oriented. ""for the government to even consider granting permission for running a high speed motorcar rally through such a sensitively balanced ecological area is pure callousness towards nature and the land we live upon,"" cama says. but this is a tricky situation when one considers the fact that one-third of the country's salt production is from this area alone. the salt pans are also destroying the corridors and channels that the wild ass and other animals use for movement, as they need to go to the village boundaries. there were 100 salt pan industries in the rann at the time of its declaration as a sanctuary as per forest department estimates. but today, there are over 1,000 salt pan lessees inside the area, despite it being a protected area! adding to the problems is the exotic plant variety, prosopis juliflora, which is spreading all over the rann and making life difficult for the wild ass, which prefer open space. grazing by cattle from nearby villages only increases the pressure on food availability for the wild ass. the gujarat ecological education and research foundation, which conducted a study there, recommended an urgent demarcation of the sanctuary after settling all legal problems.
