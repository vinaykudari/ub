0,Vikas Vihar has no water since April,"NEW DELHI: Delhi was recently declared drought-hit, but even before that there were areas which had not received drinking water for over four months. Vikas Vihar in west Delhiâ€™s Uttam Nagar is one such colony.

The taps there have been dry since April and residents do not expect it to get better until September. They know, since water-less summers have been a regular feature since 1998.

V K Keshawan, the local RWA secretary, said: â€˜â€˜We are left with no option but to walk two km at least every day, to fetch potable water from Najafgarh Road. The old and the infirm have to spend extra on a rickshaw.â€™â€™

The residents have threatened to sit in dharna if their problem is not resolved fast. Residents like D L Gupta said the RWA has knocked at every possible door in the Delhi Jal Board, but their efforts have been futile.

In 1998, the DJBâ€™s excuse was shortage of water from Haryana and in 2002 the reply was that these colonies are at the tail end of the distribution line.

The police is investigating as to who would buy the stolen rice. â€˜Hisar to get by-passâ€™: Haryana Urban Development Agency (HUDA) has sanctioned Rs 225 crore to construct a bypass in Hisar. Deepti Umashankar, deputy commissioner, said the bypass would link Tosham road with Rajgarh road in the south of the city. The city already has a bypass on the Sirsa-Delhi road.

The new by-pass will ease traffic in and around the city, decreasing the number of accidents and smoothen traffic flow. Umashankar further said colonies which had been developed 50 per cent would be recommended for regularisation.

2,Traders protest police inaction on child killing,"LUCKNOW: Former MLA and local Samajwadi Party leader Ravidas Mehrotra on Sunday led a protest against the inaction of the police in connection with the mysterious missing and subsequent murder of a 10-year-old boy residing in Khayaliganj locality. Shops were closed in Nazirabad as the protest on the road was dissolved owing to rains on Sunday evening.

On July 1, Mohd Adnan (10), a student of the City Montessori School, station road branch, was playig outside his house in Khayaliganj with his cousin and classmate Adil. Later, in the evening, Adnan was found missing. Adil told family members that when the two were playing outside a man approached them and enquired about a soft drink shop in the area.

When Adnan told him about the shop, the man requested to be escorted to the spot. Adnan went to show the man where the shop was and did not return. The incident was reported to the police but neither any ransom call nor threat were received by the family members of the missing boy. However the police alerted the Government Railway Police and vigil was increased at Kaiserbagh bus station and Charbagh but to no avail. The photograph of the missing boy was flashed on the Doordarshan as well. But in the absence of even a hint as to who could be behind the incident, there was nothing much left the that police could do.

On the contrary, the Dewan police in Bara Banki recovered the body of the boy and discovered from the tailor sticker on the collar of the victimâ€™s shirt that it was stiched at a shop in Nazirabad. They, however, did not even bother to inform the Lucknow Police about the recovery of the body, leave alone trying to trace the identity of the boy by way of personal queries at the tailoring shop. It was through the newspapers that the victimâ€™s family members reached Bara Banki and identified the deceased from the photographs and the shirt.

3,Army will have no direct role in J&K polls: George,"SRINAGAR: Defence minister George Fernandes Sunday sidestepped persistent demands being raised on imposition of governor's rule in the state, saying it was up to the Election Commission to decide on the conduct of polls. He assured that no ''electoral loot'' would be allowed in the ensuing assembly elections in Jammu and Kashmir, Fernandes, addressing troops engaged in counter insurgency in the state, said, ''In our democratic set-up the need of the hour is to conduct honest elections in the state, ensuring that the electoral mandate is not looted.'' In Weibug, south Kashmir, he was surprised at facing a barrage of questions during his two-day tour, not about militancy or jobs, but only on why elections could not not be held under central rule. He said, ''It is up to the Election Commission on how to conduct the polls and it knows its role. We will go by what the body decides on the conduct of elections.'' Fernandes also denied any difference of opinion in the government over the Jammu and Kashmir election schedule, saying that any conjectures being made on the issue were ''wrong''. Declaring that the Army had no direct role to play in the elections, Fernandes said the security forces had a duty to ensure that all moves to disrupt the election process by inimical forces were foiled.

4,Transporters criticise govt,"PATNA: Even as the deadlock between the government and the transporters over road tax hike continued for the fifth day, the main political parties have by and large remained silent on the issue. A few political parties have expressed concern over the hardship caused to the people â€” schoolgoing children in particular â€” and problems in relief work. The parties have refrained from commenting on the road tax hike, particularly in the case of buses which is exorbitant Rs 66,000 per quarter.

â€œThe Bihar Finance Bill, 2001 was formulated secretively and passed by the legislature without the political parties pointing out the economic hardship it would cause to the transporters,â€� stressed the president of the Bihar Motor Transport Federation Jagannath Singh. Another transporter, Durga Yadav, stressed that after they came to know about the exorbitant hike proposed in road taxes, they had petitioned the President, home ministry and even Sonia Gandhi against the move.

They said the transport department is creating confusion by stressing that there has been only a 10 per cent hike in road tax for buses. â€œIf the government had hiked the tax by 10 per cent only, a fresh Bill would not have been needed. There is a provision in the 1994 Act enabling the government to hike the road tax by 40 per cent through a notification,â€� stated the federationâ€™s general secretary Sarigul Haque.

6,BMC to inculcate civic sense in Mumbaikars,"MUMBAI: The municipality is aiming high. In the cleanliness campaign to be launched on August 15, the Brihan-mumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has set itself a seemingly impossible taskâ€”inculcating civic sense in Mumbaikars.

With 200 nuisance detectors on the job to fine litterbugs and spitters, additional municipal commissioner Gautam Chatterjee hopes that in three months even the compulsive offender would clean up his act. While civic observers welcome the campaign, they say that lack of civic sense is so deep-rooted in the city that a mere â€œcosmetic surgeryâ€™â€™ wouldnâ€™t quite help. â€œMumbaikars donâ€™t have civic sense which is expected from a civilised society,â€™â€™ says AGNI member Dinesh Ahir. Cynics cite gloomy everyday picturesâ€”two-wheelers and pedestrians dodging spittle from a passing bus, cars crashing traffic lights, resting tired feet on train seats (with shoes on, of course) and myriad disturbing snippets in a mindless city.

The BMC, though, is optimistic. â€œHabits do take time to change, but I have noticed that Mumbaikars are open to change. My staff has never met with stiff resistance from offenders in Mumbai, but in places like say, Bihar, where I hail from, a civic employee trying to correct a litterbug would face arrogance,â€™â€™ says Mr Chatterjee. Lack of awareness also breeds indifference. â€œThere are people who meticulously throw food wrappers in the gutter and assume that that is the most civic-minded thing to do. They donâ€™t know that the drains would choke with garbage,â€™â€™ says a civic officer, admitting that there is an acute shortage of litterbins in the city. And what about the walls and banisters of government buildings, including the civic headquarters, that are painted with paan stains? Mr Chatterjee replies, â€œIt is a result of people going unpunished for many years.

People have ceased to think that spitting, littering or urinating in public places is a civic crime.â€™â€™ He adds that enforcement agencies should follow this doggedly. Realising that merely nuisance detectors would not be adequate, the BMC has urged the police, non-governmental organisations and even the National Cadet Corps (NCC) to volunteer in catching offenders. Bandraâ€™s Savita Mehra, who has been in the forefront in segregating dry and wet waste on Peter Dias Road, spells out a â€œcapital NOâ€™â€™ in reply to a question whether we have civic sense. â€œWe grumble about bad roads, traffic jams and dirty streets, but have we ever asked ourselves if we are in anyway responsible for this mess?â€™â€™ she aks.

â€œWe think that we only own the vehicle and not the road. It is we who generate huge amount of garbage. What saddens me is that the roads are swept by the taxpaying civic employees for those people who evade taxes,â€™â€™ she adds. However, Ms Mehra still has hope.

7,Seven hurt in Buxar village group clash,"BUXAR/ARA: At least seven persons, including two CPI-ML supporters and a teenaged girl, sustained gunshot injuries in a fierce battle between two rival groups at Amarpuri village under Sonebarsha police station of the Buxar district on Sunday. While one of the warring group owed its allegiance to Oyena panchayat mukhiya, the other group comprised supporters of a cattle fair contractor and ML men.

Police recovered several countrymade weapons, including guns and pistols, and hundreds of empty cartridges from the mukhiyaâ€™s house and arrested one dozen of his supporters. Sources said a police team led by Dumraon SDPO Chandrama Prasad was camping in the village.

Eyewitnesses said hundreds of ML supporters had blocked the Ara-Mohania road near Sonebarsha on Sunday demanding that Buxar be declared a drought-hit district. In the meantime, Braj Kishore Pandey, younger brother of the mukhiya of Oyena panchayat, had a verbal duel with the agitators who did not allow his tractor to proceed ahead.

As the ML supporters were returning after lifting the blockade, they were allegedly attacked by the mukhiyaâ€™s supporters. This led to an exchange of fire between the two groups for about an hour.

Following the incident, a cattle fair contractor of Eyar village, Amar Singh, along with his supporters went to the mukhiyaâ€™s house in Sonebarsha. He was attacked by the mukhiyaâ€™s men and injured. As the news spread, hundreds of ML supporters attacked the mukhiyaâ€™s house and an exchange of fire ensued between the two groups.

Buxar SP Sunil Kumar said only five persons were injured in the clash.

8,Tension in Jehanabad after naxal violence,"MADUA (JEHANABAD): Tension and fear of reprisals stalk Madua, Ramdevchak and over a score of other neighbouring villages in the north-western portion of the Jehanabad district following the continuing war of attrition between the PWG and the CPI-ML (Liberation).

The entire area extending as far as Masaurhi and Naubatpur in the Patna district has become like a dormant volcano, ready to erupt any moment, thanks to the internecine feud between the PWG and the ML.

The sequence of bloody events during the past few weeks indicate that the ongoing war for supremacy between the two warring Naxalite groups is likely to escalate in the days to come. Poor villagers seem to be badly sandwiched between the two warring groups.

Madua and Ramdevchak are fresh links in the long chain of killings and counter-killings carried out by the PWG and the ML in the district during the past two years. About a dozen ML and PWG supporters were mowed down at Salarpur, Brahmachak and Khesaribigha villages under the Kalpa and the Korouna police stations of the district during the past couple of years.

In June, an armed squad of the PWG attacked the house of a ML worker at Bhuseinchak village under the Kalpa police station and killed his young son. On July 28, the PWG men detained the tractor of an ML activist at Kumarubigha village under the Korouna police station. Again on July 31, the members of the PWG armed squad blew up the house of ML supporter Lakshmi Sao at Kinari village under the Kalpa police station and torched a Tata-407 vehicle parked outside the house.

Adding fuel to the fire, the PWG men have been forcibly occupying six bighas of land belonging to one Lallan Paswan at Madua village for the past several years. Lallan Paswan is the district-level functionary of the ML.

Sources said the killing of four PWG supporters at Madua village on Friday night is a sequel to the series of depredations wrought by the PWG on the ML workers. Making a swift retaliatory move, the PWG men raided the neighbouring Ramdevchak village on Saturday night and gunned down two ML supporters.

9,Naidu to ministers: Make welfare programmes a success,"HYDERABAD: Chief minister and Telugu Desam Party president N Chandrababu Naidu on Sunday cracked the whip against some ministers and senior leaders for not evincing keen interest in the Chaduvula Panduga programme.

Expressing his displeasure, Naidu is learnt to have told them that they should spend at least two days during the period in their respective constituencies and monitor the implementation of the programme involving the cadre.

According to a senior minister, Naidu had virtually given them a dressing down during the morning meetings he has with some of the ministers and senior leaders at his residence. He told them that the opposition was already trying to ridicule the â€œwellintendedâ€™â€™ programme saying that the government was holding a â€œpanduga during droughtâ€™â€™.

Such politically motivated slogans can easily catch up with the people and negate the efforts of the government to promote literacy, he told the party leaders.

He also told them that it was not just the responsibility of the chief minister to see that the programme becomes successful. It has to be a well coordinated effort. It requires lot of motivation to ensure that children of families below the poverty line enroll in the schools and do not drop out.

Proper identification of such children was also necessary. Naidu told them that the reports he had received so far from the districts indicate that the ministers were yet to visit their constituencies and enthuse the people. He said that it was important that the programme succeeds, as the stakes are high for the party. While sensitising people on the need to send their children to school and help promote literacy and eradicate child labour, the occasion can be utilised to talk about other programmes taken up by the party in the last two years.

TDP claims to be a party which was with people at all times. If the ministers and leaders do not go to their constituencies, then in what way can the TDP claim to be different from other parties, Naidu asked them.

14,"RSS tells BJP, State Morcha to fight J&K polls together","NEW DELHI: In a significant move to prevent division of votes in the coming Assembly polls in Jammu and Kashmir, the RSS on Monday asked senior leaders of the BJP and the newly formed Jammu State Morcha to close ranks and fight the elections together.

During the two-hour meeting at the RSS headquarters here, RSS Joint General Secretary in-charge of BJP Madan Das Devi told a BJP delegation led by party General Secretary Rajnath Singh and Morcha Chairman Shrikumar to arrive at some kind of seat adjustments ahead of the polls to prevent an ""internal contest"" within the Parivar, Sangh sources said.

While the RSS-backed Morcha, a recently formed amalgam of 19 political and social outfits, is spearheading a movement for statehood to Jammu, the BJP is opposed to any such move though it accepts that the Jammu and Ladakh regions were ""discriminated"" against.

The RSS had been demanding the re-organisation of Jammu and Kashmir with statehood for Jammu and Union Territory status for Ladakh.

When contacted, RSS Joint Spokesman Ram Madhav said that BJP leaders were receptive to the suggestion and sought time for further consultation with other party leaders.

""Both the parties felt that they can come together for the polls without any contradiction (in their respective stand). We are confident that some arrangement will be worked out,"" he said. Besides Rajnath Singh, who is in-charge of several northern states including Jammu and Kashmir, others in the BJP delegation included state in-charge Om Prakash Kohli and organising Secretary of the state party unit Manohar Lal.

15,BJP bandh hits life in Alapuzha,"ALAPUZHA: The dawn-to-dusk hartal called by the BJP to protest against Friday''s alleged police excesses on the members of its youth wing disrupted normal life in most parts of the district on Monday.

The hartal affected normal life in Alapuzha, Mararikkulam and Cherthala segments.

Barring stray incidents of stone-pelting at KSRTC buses, the hartal passed off peacefully.

Buses kept off the road, shops remained closed and educational institutions went without classes. Attendence in government offices was thin.

The Yuva Morcha workers were lathicharged during a ''symbolic blockade'' of passenger boats to highlight unsafe conditions of ferry service in the area in the backdrop of recent boat tragedy at Kumarakom.

The BJP and allied outfits have demanded disciplinary action against police officials for the lathicharge in which about 10 persons were injured.

16,"Recast medical, agricultural entrance exam rank list: HC","KOCHI: Modifying a single judge''s order, a division bench of the Kerala High Court on Monday directed the Entrance Commissioner to delete 18 questions from this year''s medical, agricultural entrance examination and then recast the rank list as quickly as possible.

Of the 18 questions, 10 questions are from chemistry, two from physics and six from biology.

The case pertains to complaints from students regarding wrong answer keys to some questions.

The direction in this regard was issued by a bench, comprising Chief Justice B.N. Srikrishna and Justice G. Sivarajan, when an appeal by the Commissioner on behalf of the state government and some aggrieved students came up before it on Monday.

The bench also directed the commissioner to recast the rank list after deleting these questions and reducing the marks of the deleted questions.

Observing that the objected questions, were not ""unique"", the bench held that the only solution was to eliminate the ""suspected"" questions. It observed that appointing other experts by the court added confusion and pointed out that it was not the court''s function to find out what the correct answer was.

Government''s appeal had sought a direction to set aside the single judge''s direction as it was ""illegal"", ""erroneous"" and contrary to opinion expressed by experts in respect of some questions.

On July 12 after considering in detail eight writ petitions complaining about the deletion of certain questions of the biology and chemistry question papers following wrong answers keys, Justice K.A. Abdul Gaffoor had directed revaluation of biology and chemistry answer papers.

The state''s appeal also pointed out that while considering the case of some students who applied for the entrance exam, the concern and future of remaining 33,000 and odd students were not considered by the single judge.

19,Sikh priests ask govt to rein in gurus,"AMRITSAR: The five Sikh high priests have warned the state government to immediately take stringent measures to restrain the anti-panthic activities of the â€˜â€˜so-called gurusâ€™â€™, Ashutosh Maharaj, chief of Divya Jyoti Jagran Sansthan of Noormehal and Baba Piara Singh Bhaniara.

If no action was taken to curb their activties, the priests further warned that the Khalsa Panth would be forced to adopt its own course to eradicate them from the â€˜â€˜holy land of gurusâ€™â€™. In such an eventuality, itâ€™s not they, but the government, will have to take blame for it, they added. While addressing the media persons at the Akal Takht office, the five high priests also announced the formation of a high-powered committee within 15 days that would function under the aegis of the Akal Takht.

The committee would keep a sharp eye both on the actions taken by the government and on the antipanthic deeds of â€˜â€˜deradarsâ€™â€™. Besides, the committee would also chalk out their future course of action.

Jathedar of Akal Takht Giani Joginder Singh Vedanti said that the alleged blasphemous activities of Noormehalias have hurt the religious sentiments of the Sikhs and the inaction of the government to put a check on them had created conditions similar to the one in 1978 when 13 Sikhs were killed in an armed clash with Nirankaris who were also blamed for anti-Sikh activities.

This incident is considered as a precursor to full-blown terrorism in the state. However, Vedanti sounded evasive on the precise course of action to be taken by the Khalsa Panth on dealing with the Noormehalia threat. Prof Manjit Singh, jathedar of Takht Keshgarh Sahib, expressed hope that the government would find an amicable solution without letting the crisis slip out of its control.

He clarified that the Sikh clerics didnâ€™t want the state to be pushed into turmoil again and were opposed to any bloodshed. Singh added that the action programme to be prepared by the committee would include the suggestions on how to prevent the anti-gurmat activities of the so-called gurus who preach the distorted form of Gurbani and interpret the same to further their own agenda.

In reply to a question about the Radha Swami dera, as objected to by many in the joint meeting of various Sikh bodies and intellectuals, Manjit Singh saidthat the high priests were primarily concerned with Ashutosh and Baba Bhaniara.

They also expressed satisfaction over the response to their call to various Sikh bodies to hold a joint meeting and claimed that about 100 representatives from different organisations had attended the meeting.
