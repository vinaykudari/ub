0,After 6 pm criminals rule Gurgaon,"NEW DELHI: Manjiri Kalghatgi was driving from her office in Gurgaonâ€™s Sector 32 to her DLF Phase-I home on May 17 at 6.30 pm. Suddenly, five persons in a car forced her to stop.

A masked man got down and approached her with a gun. When she did not roll down the window, he broke it, forced the door open and threw her out, before escaping with her car. All this happened during the rush hour, off the busy Mehrauli-Gurgaon road near the Sector 29 police station.

Getting her car back, after it was traced in Ajmer on May 19, proved to be as tortuous as losing it. â€˜â€˜I got it back only two days ago. I faced so much trouble from the police. My trauma was compounded several times over. Had I paid bribes, the process, perhaps, could have been expedited,â€™â€™ said Manjiri.

Gurgaon residents widely feel that they have a police force which is indisciplined and steeped in corruption. They allege that senior officers are aware of this, but do nothing about it. In such a situation, ordinary people live in fear of reprisals and can hardly be expected to come forward and lodge complaints.

Says a top executive in a corporate house based in Gurgaon:â€˜â€˜What kind of senior police officers are these? It is well-known that policemen in Gurgaon have been behaving like hoodlums while in uniform. They openly take money, harass residents. Everyone knows it, how come their bosses donâ€™t? Why donâ€™t they discipline their men?â€™â€™

The breakdown in law and order is now one of the reasons for people wanting to shift out of Gurgaon or not move there at all.

â€˜â€˜Though Gurgaonâ€™s population has increased, the number of patrol jeeps and motorcycles is inadequate. Maybe after the newspaper reports, senior officers will take more interest in policing,â€™â€™ former foreign secretary J N Dixit, who lives in DLF Phase-I, said.

â€˜â€˜The corporate members of the Society for the Urban Regeneration of Gurgaon (Surge) had, last year, given seven motorcycles to the Gurgaon police. An MoU was signed with the IG stating these would be used only for patrolling duty in the urban areas,â€™â€™ said Surge official Baldev Sharma. He said he will now â€˜â€˜find out whether they are being used or notâ€™â€™.

Inspector-general of police, Gurgaon range, Swaranjit Singh, agrees Gurgaon has a lot of crime but obliquely blamed Delhi for it. â€˜â€˜It has historically been a crime-prone area due to its proximity to Delhi.â€™â€™

â€˜â€˜Whoever has a grievance can come and meet me in my office between 11.30 am and 1.30 pm. We will definitely take action,â€™â€™ Singh said. Superintendent of police Kuldeep Singh Siag also said he wouldnâ€™t act unless a complaint was lodged. â€˜â€˜Whenever we receive a complaint, we will act on it,â€™â€™ he said.

Asked if the victims, several of whom say they were scared of approaching the police, could muster the courage to complaint against policemen, he said: â€˜â€˜We keep on receiving complaints against policemen. This month itself we have suspended five constables and a head constable for either taking money from truckers or misbehaving in a drunken state. Several complaints have also been filed against policemen.â€™â€™

1,CM appoints 2 principal secys in one dept,"LUCKNOW: The â€˜Mayawati rouletteâ€™ is not only spinning bureaucrats but churning out strange results. After making batchmates losing track of their colleagues, she has appointed two principal secretaries in one department, a new experiment hitherto unknown in the stateâ€™s history.

The stateâ€™s social welfare department has two principal secretaries â€” Dharmendra Deo and Manjulika Gautam. While Deo is appointed commissioner-cum-principal secretary (PS), a new post (of PS) has been created in the minority welfare department for Manjulika Gautam. Prior to Gautamâ€™s appointment the department never had an officer of the rank of principal secretary.

Soon after she took over the reins in the state, high-profile Dharmendra Deo was given the prized post of chairman-CEO, Noida. But as he failed to meet the expectations of the chief minister he was shunted to religious endowment, a post considered â€˜kaalaapaniâ€™ in bureaucratic parlance.

After serving the punishment posting, Deo managed his new posting through the â€˜ground floorâ€™ and was appointed as the commissioner-cum-principal secretary, social welfare two days ago. Manjulika Gautam is learnt to have been replaced from the transport department to facilitate the posting of a Dalit officer who was feeling sidelined in Mayawati Raj.

To accommodate Gautam in the social welfare department, a new post of principal secretary was created in the minority welfare. The sanctioned posts in the social welfare department are one commissioner-cum-principal secretary and four secretaries who look after social welfare, handicapped, backward and minority welfare.

â€œIt is chief ministerâ€™s prerogative. She can appoint anyone anywhere,â€� claimed a senior appointment department officer. â€œTrue, when a non-cadre technocrat can be appointed on the cadre post (as IDC), then anything is possible in Uttar Pradesh cadre where norms are blown to smithereens by politicos,â€� commented a special secretary.

In the transfer melee, the appointment department seems to have forgotten that never in the past two principal secretaries have been appointed in the social welfare department. The whimsical appointment may cause functional problem in the department. Although Deo is three years senior to the 1972-batch Manjulika Gautam, she wants to keep her separate identity in the minority welfare department. So while Deo would remain the sectoral head of the department, Gautam is reluctant to take orders from him as commissioner on field matters. This may result in chaos in day to day functioning of the department.

In majority of transfers, it is the â€˜ground floorâ€™, the new power centre in the CM secretariat, which prevailed over â€˜fifth floorâ€™. Take for example, transfers effected in Noida and Greater Noida where about ten officers have been sent on â€˜test postingâ€™ by the ground floor.

Brajesh Kumar was replaced by Dr Om Prakash soon after Mayawati took over. He was served marching orders after 18 days. Lalit Srivastava, who replaced him, also failed to give â€˜resultsâ€™ and was shown the doors in a weekâ€™s time. DS Bains met the same fate.

GR Berua could manage the show for about a month before being replaced by Anoop Misra, a couple of days ago. But apparently Misra too failed to meet the ground floorâ€™s or the chief ministerâ€™sâ€˜expectationsâ€™ and was replaced by Deepak Singhal on Tuesday. How long would Singhal last? Only Mayawati knows or the officers calling the shots know.

2,BJP wants all-party meet on Krishna water issue,"HYDERABAD: The state unit of the BJP has demanded the government to conduct an allparty meeting on the Krishna waters issue to understand better the water crisis gripping the state.

Addressing a press conference on Tuesday, BJP state vice-president S V Seshagiri Rao pointed out that there was a defect in the Bachawat Tribunalâ€™s award as the pro-rata sharing was not taken into consideration in the lean season.

â€œThe distribution of waters is therefore on a first-come-first-serve basis,â€� he said.â€œThe government ought to have completed important projects like Telugu Ganga and others before the expiry of the Bachawat Tribunalâ€™s award,â€� he observed.

Rao asked the government to be vigilant about the Karnataka governmentâ€™s irrigation projects and bring that stateâ€™s â€œirregularitiesâ€� to the Centreâ€™s notice. He said the construction of the upper Tunga project in Karnataka would reduce inflow into the state.

Rao objected to the reported remarks of Karnataka minister H K Patel that the construction of the upper Tunga project was not in violation of the Bachawat award and blamed the Karnataka government for the violation of guidelines for the last four years by constructing medium irrigation projects.

Asked why the BJP as the main opposition party in Karnataka was not playing an active role on the water issue, he said the issue should be resolved by the two governments and not by political parties.

3,No power in Army HQ since Monday,"NEW DELHI: Sena Bhawan, the Armyâ€™s headquarters, has been without power for over 24 hours, leading to a collapse of crucial information systems ahead of Independence Day.

The prolonged power cut sparked panic among senior officers who sent SOS messages to the New Delhi Municipal Council seeking the early restoration of supply in view of the alert for I-Day.

Sena Bhawanâ€™s power went off at 9 pm on Monday, just three days before Independence Day, for which the entire city has been put on alert. Last year militants had managed to explode a crude bomb near the building.

Till Tuesday evening, NDMC engineers were struggling to restore the supply, but with no success. â€˜â€˜Our men are facing problems as even the alternative source of supply has faults,â€™â€™ said electricity department official.

The official said several attempts were made to restore power to Sena Bhawan late on Monday night. â€˜â€˜The supply kept tripping whenever we restored it. At 5 am on Tuesday, a fault was detected in the distribution panel of the sub-station in the building,â€™â€™ he said.

When this snag was fixed, it was detected that a feeder cable passing under a road opposite the building had been cut in four places.

â€˜â€˜This fault was rectified by noon but when the supply was switched on, another snag developed, this one about one kilometre away from building,â€™â€™ said an engineer.

Even this fault has been repaired, but there seems to be another problem which we are trying to detect, he said. A defence ministry spokesman said he was not aware of the major power breakdown at Sena Bhawan.

Sources said the building was put on back-up power when the failure was first detected. â€˜â€˜But not all systems were linked to the generator, and this affected work in the building,â€™â€™ an official said.

5,BJP assails Musharraf's remarks on J&K polls,"NEW DELHI: The BJP on Wednesday took strong exception to Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf describing the forthcoming polls in Jammu and Kashmir as ""farcical"" and that his country not be held responsible for failure of the polls as a ""challenge to the civilised world which is fighting the menace of global terrorism.""

""Musharraf''s address to the nation on the occasion of Pakistan''s Independence Day is a challenge to the civilised world which is fighting the menace of global terrorism and his nervousness to the democratic procedure in Jammu and Kashmir is obvious,"" party spokesman Sunil Shastri said here.

He took strong exception to Musharraf describing the terrorist acts in the state as ""freedom struggle"" saying, ""we strongly object to this remark by him and totally condemn it."" He said it is through elections that the people of the state would be able to address their faith in India''s sovereignty and democracy.

Shastri said Musharraf should concentrate on holding elections in his country rather than be concerned about the Assembly polls in Jammu and Kashmir. He said it was Musharraf who had made a mockery of elections when he held the referendum for his Presidency.

6,Arms supplier of Kandahar hijackers arrested,"SILIGURI: Santosh Subba, wanted by the CBI for allegedly supplying arms to the hijackers of the Indian Airlines aircraft from Kathmandu to Kandahar in December 1999, was arrested on Wednesday from Darjeeling district, a senior police official said.

The hijackers had received the arms through Kumar Bhujel, already in CBI custody, who had got them from Santosh, Superintendent of Police Sanjay chander told reporters here.

Santosh alias Gore also wanted in connection with the attempt on the life of Gorkha National Liberation Front President Subhas Ghising in February last year, is the 29-year-old son of Gorkha Liberation Organisation chief Chattre Subba, now in jail on the same charge.

An AK-47 assault rifle with two full magazines were seized from Santosh after his arrest, the SP said.

The CBI had been contacted at New Delhi and a team of the investigating agency was expected within a day or two, he said.

Police raided Santosh''s hideout at Gangep, a remote place, after trekking for three and a half hours, on the basis of information given by an arms dealer, Kazi Viswakarma, arrested from Sakiyang in Kalimpong on August 11.

The AK-47 seized from Santosh was sold to him by Viswakarma and might have been used during the attempt on the life of Ghising on February 10 last year, Chander said.

Santosh earlier lived in Biratnagar in Nepal where he taught in a school for quite some time, but he was dismissed after it was discovered that he had produced fake documents in support of his educational qualifications, the SP said.

When asked whether Santosh was involved with any terrorist group particularly Maoists of Nepal, Chander said nothing could be ruled out.

Police also suspected that he had links with the NSCN, he said.

10,"Belawadi makes Anant, Suhasini `stumble'","BANGALORE: What happens when people from a middle-class background rush into fields like IT, software and business?

They stumble. This is what popular Kannada theatre person and director Prakash Belawadi tries to say in his English movie `Stumble'' being shot in Bangalore with Anant Nag and Suhasini in the lead roles.

``Stumble is a film on contemporary economy which also has social relevance that affects the urban middle-class. It speaks of how middle-class people who opt for VRS, struggle after investing their money in stock markets. Parallelly it deals with how youngsters who join hi-tech companies are laid off and are unable to find employment elsewhere as they are not trained in other skills,"" says Belawadi, taking a break from the shooting in a house at BTM layout here on Wednesday.

The shot saw Anant Nag, clad in silk `dhoti'' and a `shalya'' performing pooja along with Suhasini. It was okayed in just two takes.

Belawadi, who has himself written the story, says: ``I planned to do it in Kannada, but the message I wanted to convey is universal. So it had to be in English. But the treatment will be closer to Kannada culture.""

Anant Nag, who plays a bank employee, said, ``Kannada is limited to only Karnataka. But we want to carry the message of the film all over India and abroad.''''

On his role, Nag said, ``It''s an exceptional role. I am a middle-class man working in a bank with a son studying abroad. I take VRS, invest money in stocks and lose all of it. Even the son comes back after a layoff. From then on, my wife and father stand by me. It is the kind of role which I always wanted to do.''''

Suhasini, who was in Bangalore for five days for the shooting, plays Nag''s wife. ""Certain scenes are performance-oriented. But Nag''s character is better than mine. It is the fourth film that I am doing with him.''''

11,Pawar likely to effect changes in his party,"MUMBAI: Nationalist Congress Party President Sharad Pawar is all set to reorganise his three-year old party to consolidate his position in the state.

A few NCP ministers are likely to be assigned organisational jobs.

At present, all party units at the state or district level stand dissolved. Mr Pawar may consult his close aides and finalise the list of office-bearers and committee members.

The reorganization of the party has become inevitable as five NCP MLAs have been disqualified by speaker Arun Gujarathi. According to NCP minister, Mr Pawar will have to do a balancing act to pacify some disgruntled elements.

Higher education minister Dilip Valse Patil, rural development minister R.R. Patil and ex-MP Suryakanta Patil are the front-runners for the top post to replace state NCP chief Pachpute.

13,More shops to be open till 10 pm,"NEW DELHI: Markets in Karol Bagh, Sarojini Nagar and a few shops in South Extension and Lajpat Nagar may soon be allowed to remain open till 10 pm â€” a concession of three hours.

The move is aimed at checking parking problems in commercial centres during peak hours and providing convenient shopping hours to Delhiites, who can only venture out late in the evening.

The Delhi government has already granted permission to a number of stores like the Ebony in South Extension, Planet M in Karol Bagh and Archies and Media Toys in Janak Place to remain open till 10 pm.

Owners of shops in Hauz Khas, Rajouri Garden, Laxmi Nagar, Vikaspuri and Gole Market are also queueing up for permission to remain open beyond 7.30 pm.

Labour commissioner S P Marwah said shops need to remain open for longer hours due to the changing lifestyles and work culture.

â€˜â€˜With more and more people working beyond conventional working hours, a large section of consumers find time to shop only after 7.30 pm â€” the official market closure time,â€™â€™ he said.

The liberal timings would not apply to restaurants and bars as they do not come under the ambit of the Shop and Establishment Act, 1954.
