0,Govt. urged to help end violence against women,"PUNE: Primary education, health care, gender equality and empowerment of women were some of the issues highlighted by women in the city on International Womenâ€™s Day.

At a programme organised by the Stree Mukti Andolan Sampark Samiti at S.M. Joshi hall, social worker Manisha Sathe of the Mahila Sarvangeen Utkarsh Mandal (Masum), stressed that violence against women and health care were key problems the government needed to tackle.

She drew the attention of the audience to the plight of women in rural areas. A majority of them, she said,were treated as commodities. â€œEven more disheartening is that, under the guise of religion and culture, women are often deprived of their basic right to education and health,â€� Sathe observed.

To celebrate the occasion, the Pune Municipal Corporationâ€™s (PMC) social welfare department, in association with the citybased Amhi Maitrini, organised a cultural event in the evening at the Bal Gandharva Rangmandir. PMCâ€™s deputy commissioner (social welfare department) Anil Gaikwad pointed out that with a network of 20,000 women, it had formed nearly 1,000 savings groups in the cityâ€™s slums. â€œThis endeavour was possible only because to the active participation of women,â€� Gaikwad said. He added that the PMC had also established several support groups to tackle violence against women.

1,Dinsha poised to change his political disha,"AHMEDABAD: If the Congress had done well in the December 2002 assembly elections, Dinsha Patel could well have been an important minister, if not the chief minister.

Dinsha is set to join the BJP in the next couple of days, if reliable sources are to be believed, in what will possibly be a virtual coup for the ruling party. Ever since film and television stars and even Congressmen started jumping onto the BJP bandwagon at the central level a couple of weeks back, the state unit has been wanting to poach on some prominent Congressmen.

And what bigger catch than one of the five MPs that the Congress has in Gujarat. That too, a Patel, when the other six Patel MPs in the dissolved Lok Sabha were from the BJP.

Once considered a titan among politicians in the Charotar belt of central Gujarat and having won the Nadiad assembly constituency consecutively for five elections, Dinsha made his debut as MP in 1996 from Kheda with a margin of 50,000 votes. Sources say that the BJP will field Dinsha from the same seat.

Asked about his plans for the polls, Dinsha would not give a firm denial on the possibility of him joining the BJP. He said, ""I am yet to decide, let people talk what they want!""

This man, whose political moves have always been discreet, suddenly contested the last assembly polls, only to lose to Pankaj Desai once a Dinsha loyalist who joined the BJP in 1998.

Desai was among those who followed Dinsha from the Janata Dal to the Congress during the merger, and now it looks like Dinsha might be following in his footsteps.

A few weeks ago, in a bid to build political capital, Dinsha embarked on a Sardar Patel yatra from Bardoli to the Somnath temple. Even till that time, he was critical of the BJP which, he said, was trying to ''appropriate Sardar Patel''. Signs of disillusionment with the Congress had begun surfacing during the assembly election itself, which he lost.

He had then admitted that the ''elections would be tough especially because they were fought on communal lines''.

Analysts said that Dinsha has realised that he can''t win the Kheda seat on a Congress ticket.

The soft-spoken 65-year-old Dinsha is a Leuva Patel from among the cash-rich and landed Patels of Kheda. His family lives in the US where most Patels owe their allegiance to the BJP.

And Dinsha is one politician for whom even the BJP has a good word.

In 1998,when the assembly and Lok Sabha elections were held together, Dinsha was returned to the Parliament from Kheda for the second time,while Congress lost the Nadiad assembly seat to Desai who had defected to the BJP.

2,Gujarat riots make Om Puri join Cong,"MUMBAI: Well-known actor Om Puri, who joined the Congress here on Tuesday, caused considerable embarrassment to the party by giving his own explanation as to why Sonia Gandhi had retained her Italian passport for as long as 16 years after marrying Rajiv Gandhi.

Replying toaquestion, Mr Puri said she probably wanted to visit Italy often and did not want to face visa hassles. Mr Puri also indicated that the people had the right to throw out the Congress in the next election if it did not deliver after being voted to power this timearound.

The actor said he had campaigned for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the past election, but felt that the time had come for a change. Asked why he had turned against the BJP, he said, â€œI was in London when I came to know about the riots in Gujarat. After the killing of Indira Gandhi, Delhi did witness anti-Sikh riots, but they were controlled in three days.â€™â€™ He alleged, â€œIn Gujarat, the riots continued under BJP rule for six months, with the police and politicians playing a part in them.â€™â€™

Mr Puri added, â€œThe picture of a Muslim youth, with terror written large on his face, continues to haunt me.â€™â€™ Asked why he did not protest against the Gujarat violence when it took place,Mr Puri shot back: â€œWould you people in the press have published my views? I had no platform. Now that I have one after joining the Congress I will definitely speak out against what happened in Gujarat.â€™â€™

Congress spokesperson Kapil Sibal, in whose presence Mr Puri joined the party, said Deputy Prime Minister L K Advaniâ€™s â€œso-called yatra was nothing but Advani on wheelsâ€™â€™.

He said Mr Advani was feeling sidelined in the BJP and hence decided to embark on yet another yatra to remain in the limelight. He said Mr Advani would be travelling in the air-conditioned comfort of a Swaraj Mazda van that had hightech gadgets.

â€œFor a yatra, one has to sacrifice and live like a saint and not travel in style. Instead of undertaking a Bharat Uday Yatra, Mr Advani should undertake a â€˜regret yatraâ€™, to apologise to the nation for the communal riots that rocked the country after his earlier yatras,â€™â€™Mr Sibal said.

3,Constable arrested for job fraud,"KOLKATA: A policeman was arrested on Tuesday for cheating a youth. He had promised to get the youth a job in the force showing a letter ""signed"" by the commissioner of police. The north division constable, Swapan Roy, had allegedly demanded Rs 1 lakh for the appointment, the final instalment of which was to be paid on Tuesday afternoon. He was caught red-handed while taking the money.

It is not known whether Roy had cheated others, too. ""We are yet to interrogate him thoroughly,"" said DC (DD) Soumen Mitra. The 45-year-old constable had been extorting Srikanta Kar of Uluberia for a fortnight.

During the day, he had asked Kar to meet him near Bhawani Cinema in Tollygunge. Detectives went there and arrested him.

Kar had approached the DC (DD) sensing something wrong in the deal. To justify the out-ofturn appointment without any advertisement, Roy had shown him a letter written and signed by commissioner of police Sujoy Chakraborty, stating that a few constables would be recruited as a special case. He had even introduced him to his nephew, who claimed he got a job with the city police through Roy. To be doubly sure, Kar went to Royâ€™s Sambhunath Pandit Street quarters and met his elderly mother. She, too, vouched for her son.

However, even after paying a part of the money, Kar was not convinced. He went to Lalbazar and met Mitra. A probe was conducted by the criminal intelligence wing, which later arrested Roy. Mitra said the constable had been suspended pending a departmental inquiry.

""If convicted, he might lose his job,"" he added.

5,Rajnath rules out rift with JD(U),"PATNA: Union agriculture minister and in-charge of BJP affairs in Bihar Rajnath Singh hinted that the list of party''s candidates for forthcoming Lok Sabha elections would be sent to central leadership on Wednesday.

Singh, who had one-to-one meeting with several party leaders and workers to gauge their mood and assess political situation prevailing in Bihar, assured that there would be no differences with the alliance partner, Janata Dal U), over seat sharing. ""After all, we have been friends for the last five years. There is negligible chance of any schism between the two,"" Singh told TNN, adding that NDA had emerged as a major political force in the country.

Singh further said that victory of NDA in the LS poll would signal end of RJD misrule.

He said that campaign in Bihar would focus on NDA''s concern over maintenance of social harmony besides highlighting image of Vajpayee, whose personality has itself become an issue.

""Unka vyaktitva dil aur desh ko jodta hai"", Singh said. Otherwise, Vajpayee would not have been offered to contest from different states including Jammu and Kashmir, he added.

When asked about the strategy of NDA government if any attempt was made by RJD government to stop Advani''s rath yatra in Bihar, Singh said if such a situation arose, follow-up action would be initiated including petitioning to Election Commission.

Though BJP leaders are keeping the list of probable candidates close to their chest, informed sources said that, in all likelihood, the party would contest 20 seats.

According to consensus, it would adhere to ''sitting-getting formula''. However, a senior leader pointed out that in one or two constitutencies, new faces may emerge if indications are such. Party''s senior leaders are slated to meet JD(U) leaders on March 17 to discuss the final round of seat-sharing.

7,Wake up call for Congress-NCP in by-election,"PUNE: The Congress-Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) combine received a wake up call on Wednesday as it became apparent that almost 90 of their elected representatives voted against the official candidate Chandukak Jagtap in the legislative council by-election from the Pune local self government constituency.

Although Jagtap won the election by securing 381 votes as against 203 polled by Anna Joshi - the Bharatiya Janata Party-Shiv Sena candidate, it was obvious that Joshi secured more votes that the saffron combineâ€™s legitimate strength of 116. Moreover two of their voters were absent. It is believed that the elected representatives from the Mali community, which has been grumbling about being neglected by the Congress-NCP, voted against the official candidate.

The counting of votes began at the Shivajinagar foodgrains godown at 8 AM. After mixing of the ballot papers, actual counting commenced at 9 AM and returning officer and district collector Madhukar Kokate declared the result at 10.20 AM. As many as 10 votes were declared invalid.

Reacting to the verdict, Jagtap said that he expected to get around 385 votes. He rejected the claim that many Congress-NCP elected representatives voted against him. ""There are local issues and problems involved and I donâ€™t buy the argument that our legitimate voters voted against me"", he claimed.

Anna Joshi meanwhile told TNN that he was satisfied with the verdict and that he had tried his best. ""I got more votes than out legitimate share because of my contacts and work in the field. Many friends had promised to help me, some kept the promise some did not"", he remarked.

When contacted, BJP''s city unit general secretary Vikas Mathkari said that the voting pattern in the by-election was a trailer of things to come in the Lok Sabha elections. ""It is quite obvious that all is not well in the Congress-NCP combine and there is great deal of discontent. Else we would not have polled 90 extra votes"", he observed.

Mathkari pointed out that almost 90 elected representatives of Congress-NCP voted against their official candidate despite the fact that their leaders had issued a whip. ""It is clear that the Congress-NCP unity is superficial"", he added. He felt that since the 90 voters were grass root level leaders it will reflect in the voting pattern in the parliament elections in the state. ""They will definitely tilt the scales in our favour"", he stated.

Meanwhile sources said that Anna Joshi was expecting to get 305 votes since many had promised to help him. However only half of them delivered making Joshi feel as if he was betrayed. The fact that Joshi could get 90 extra votes also indicated that he still carried weight in the political circles.

Rajya Sabha member from Pune Suresh Kalmadi has congratulated Chandukaka Jagtap for the victory over the veteran BJP candidate Anna Joshi.

Speaking to TNN from Delhi, Kalmadi refuted the reports that additional votes secured by Joshi symbolise a conflict between the elected representatives of Congress and NCP.

""There is nothing to worry about. I can vouch that none of the additional votes secured by Joshi came from the Pune Municipal Corporation. In Pune city, all NCP and Congress councillors voted for Jagtap. I have no idea of what happened in the municipal councils in Pune district,"" Kalmadi said.

9,Chew on TV: Veggie ministers chicken out,"NEW DELHI: Wanted: A minister who wonâ€™t chicken out. Short of taking out this ad, the poultry industry â€” reeling under the impact of the bird flu scare â€” has done everything else.

In search of official reassurance, industry representatives have appealed to ministers to go on prime-time television and proclaim that eating chicken is absolutely safe â€” preferably by chewing into it.

The hitch is that the two ministers in question, agriculture minister Rajnath Singh and health minister Sushma Swaraj, apparently donâ€™t eat the bird â€” and probably never did, not even in the good old days before bird flu left India well alone but cut a swathe through South-East Asia.

On a more serious note, industry representative Shashi Kapur says they had appealed to the two ministers in late February. The response was â€˜â€˜very positiveâ€™â€™ but it just didnâ€™t work out. Apart from the largely vegetarian palates, election schedules have thrown all other schedules out of gear.

The third person they happened to ask, former agriculture minister Sompal turned out to be vegetarian as well.
