2,State Govt flayed for arresting Ram bhakts,"KANPUR: The Adhivakta Parishad, Uttar Pradesh, lambasted the state government here on Monday for arresting the persons who were going to Ayodhya to attend the Vishwa Hindu Parishad''s (VHP) congregation scheduled for October 17. It accused the government of being prejudiced and creating obstruction in the right to freedom.

The parishad said that the Constitution provided the liberty to a person to freely perform his religious activities; but the state government was not complying with it. Advovate Gopal Krishna Pandey sent a memorandum to the governor, stating that the Supreme Court had directed the state government to maintain status quo at the temple and ensure uninterrupted religious ceremonies there.

But the state government was arresting the devotees, he further stated. Pandey requested the governor to restore the freedom of freely moving inside the country, and ensure the rule of law instead of jungle rule. He further appealed him to immediately release the innocent devotees.

Meanwhile, in another meeting at the court here on Monday, the Advocates Welfare Council Uttar Pradesh, charged the VHP with spreading religious fanatism to hamper the country''s development. Terming the congregation as a deception, the council said that the VHP was trying to help the Bharatiya Janata Party in the forthcoming elections in the five states. General secretary of the council Pran Nath Mishra said that Ashok Singhal was instigating the people against the state and the Centre by incendiary speeches.

The members of the council have asked the state chief minister and the Prime Minister to register criminal cases under the IPC against the VHP leaders.

5,Banks prefer heist pinch to security burden,"KOLKATA: It is the bizarre circle of policies and priorities of banks and insurance companies that continues to play havoc with the security of banks. The robbers couldnâ€™t have asked for a better deal.

Bank money is insured. So, security is of the least priority to bank authorities, obsessed with cost-cutting exercises to beat competition. Whatâ€™s worse, insurance companies bargain for bigger premiums with banks that have the worst of security systems.

â€œWho cares for security,â€� DC (detective department) Soumen Mitra said, when asked about the repeated bank robberies.

It seems the robberies at Punjab and Sind Bank (Bhowanipore) and Punjab National Bank (Gariahat Road) taught no lessons. Neither branch has security guards though they are located on one of the most busiest streets of the city. Robbers had a cakewalk when they struck the two banks this year, netting nearly Rs 19 lakh in all.

â€œBankers indemnity â€” the bank money insurance scheme â€” covers hold-ups and robbery in transit. The security arrangement of each bank is mentioned during declaration. In all probability, these branches might have categorised themselves as branches without security personnel,â€� a senior officer of New India Assurance said.

After the twin heists, the police had tried their best to get banks to realise the importance of security but to no avail. In May this year, officers heading five city police divisions and the detective department met officials of leading nationalised, private and foreign banks. â€œWe underlined some basics of bank security,â€� Mitra said.

â€œBut we were taken aback by the banksâ€™ lackadaisical attitude to security. The head cashier at PSB left his chamber open and unattended. The PNB has a 161-page internal security manual, listing steps to be followed in case of a robbery. Unfortunately, none of the measures are followed,â€� an officer added.

Banks seem to consider armed guards or upgrading the security gadgets a wasteful expenditure.With the cushion of insurance, it is felt that a robbery would not directly affect the bank.

â€œBank branches no longer keep huge amounts in their safes. So the losses are minimal compared to their daily transactions,â€� an police officer said. During the annual meetings with banks and RBI officials, the police have repeatedly requested banks to install close-circuit televisions and hidden alarm switches.

â€œWe have also asked them to inform us about large transactions but all this has gone to waste,â€� a senior police officer said.

6,"No threat to govt, says BJP leader","JAMSHEDPUR: Senior BJP leader Saryu Rai on Monday asserted that there was no threat to the Arjun Munda regime.

Rai, who is a member of the partyâ€™s national executive council, also rubbished reports on the increasing strain between CM Munda and his predecessor Babulal Marandi.

There are no differences between Munda and Marandi, the BJP leader told newsmen here on Monday evening. The central leadership has directed Munda to lead the government, while Marandi has been asked to take the responsibility of party work.

Rai blamed vested interests in the state of spreading baseless rumors on the rift between Marandi and Munda. They are trying to defame the party.

7,Govt’s rehabilitation policy assailed,"JAMSHEDPUR: The Jharkhand State Irrigation Employees Association on Monday criticised the governmentâ€™s new rehabilitation policy for people displaced due to irrigation schemes.

The associationâ€™s general secretary, Shashank Kumar Ganguly, slammed the government for tampering with the earlier notification on rehabilitation of displaced people, issued by the erstwhile Bihar government. The policy is also ambiguous on several key issues, Ganguly said in a Press statement.

The association has pointed out the new rehabilitation policy framed by the irrigation department was also contradictory. On one hand, it states that every adult male member of a displaced family would be treated as a separate family unit. On the other, only the family head of separate family units would be entitled for the benefits under the rehabilitation scheme

8,HC reprieve lets Left off rally hook,"KOLKATA: Champions of the right to rally got a brief respite on Monday when a ivision Bench of Calcutta High Court stayed Justice Amitava Lalaâ€™s order banning rallies in the city between 8 am and 8 pm on weekdays. An appropriate regular Bench will hear the stateâ€™s appeal when the high court reopens on October 28.

The Bench of Justice Ashok Ganguly and Justice S.P. Talukdar passed the order after a long deliberation.

Officials and top cops heaved a sigh of relief. However, the general disappointment was palpable at the packed court room.

The court stayed Justice Lalaâ€™s 12-point directives of September 27 until further orders, in response to an appeal by the West Bengal government with supplementary affidavits.

During the day, a number of advocates had voiced strong opinions in favour of Justice Lalaâ€™s verdict. They argued that the single-Bench order was in the interest of people at large.

The division Bench directed the state to file an informal paper book by two weeks after the Puja vacation.

Advocate-general Balai Roy moved the appeal on behalf of the state and submitted to the Bench copies of Justice Lalaâ€™s order. Roy argued that the judiciary had overstepped its jurisdiction as Justice Lalaâ€™s commandment could not be implemented without legislation.

â€œObstruction of Justice Lalaâ€™s car due to a rally was a law-and-order failure. It was not wilful disobedience by the police to attract contempt,â€� he said.

â€œOur argument was that in a contempt case, the judge can either accept apology or punish the contemnor, but cannot pass such an order,â€� said the stateâ€™s advocate on record, Asim Chatterjee.

However, Roy told the court that Justice Lalaâ€™s order would be remembered by the state. â€œI have assurances from the highest authority of the state administration, that some of Justice Lalaâ€™s orders will be strongly considered for implementation.â€�

Earlier, the division Bench refused to hear the contempt of court appeal against Left Front chairman Biman Bose who had launched a verbal tirade against Justice Lala.

The petitioners, advocate Idris Ali and advocate Kallol Guha Thakurta, were asked to file application to the court after the vacation.

9,PU students’ union polls delayed,"PATNA: Patna University students are unlikely to have a union of their own in near future owing to some procedural wrangles.

The statute framed for the conduct of union elections is yet to be approved by the chancellor.

A draft statute framed for the constitution of the PU students'' union as per Section 44(2) of the Patna University Act was passed by the university Senate with some modifications more than a year back and was subsequently sent to the chancellor for obtaining his approval. Had the statute been approved by the chancellor, the elections would have been held early this year.

But the chancellor sent the draft statute to the Bihar Inter University Board (BIUB) for its clearance.

The board did not approve of some of the provisions made in the statute and returned the same to the university for modifications.

The main objection of the board was over inclusion of intermediate (plus two) students in the electoral roll as, the board thinks, they do not form part of the university system.

PU vice-chancellor K K Jha, when contacted, told TNN here that the amended statute would now be placed before the Senate, scheduled to meet on November 15.

If the draft statute gets the approval of the Senate, it would be sent to the chancellor once again for obtaining his assent.

Elections to the students union would be held within three months of the chancellor''s approval to the statute, Jha said.

PU students have been facing quite a tough time with regard to the redressal of even their genuine grievances in absence of any union as such.

They have no common platform where they could share their problems and get their grievances heard by the authorities concerned.

The last elections to PU students'' union were held in 1984 and since then the university does not have any union. In the absence of any union, dozens of student organisations owing allegiance to different political parties, besides some self-styled organisations, are active on the campus and often agitate for the fulfilment of students'' right or wrong demands.

Even the university authorities have to face a tough time in meeting the varied demands of different organisations.

Of the nine universities in Bihar, only Tilka Manjhi Bhagalpur University has got a bonafide students'' union at the university level.

10,Sonia will decide fate of DF govt: Shinde,"PUNE: Even as relations between the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) continued to be strained over the issue of Sonia Gandhi''s foreign origin, chief minister Sushilkumar Shinde on Monday said the Congress high command would decide the fate of the Democratic Front (DF) government in the state.

""It was the party high command that directed us to join the DF government. Whether the Congress should remain in the government or not will only be decided by the high command,"" Shinde told reporters after a meeting to review the water scarcity situation in Pune division.

Asked when the decision was expected from the top brass, Shinde said it may take ""seven days, 12 days or even more"".

His remark assumes significance in the backdrop of the seven-day deadline issued by Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee (MPCC) chief Ranjit Deshmukh to the NCP to decide on the leadership issue.

In response, NCP president Sharad Pawar put the ball back in the Congress'' court on Sunday, saying the NCP would not budge on the origin issue and it was up to the Congress to decide whether they wanted to remain in the DF government.

The chief minister expressed his displeasure over Pawar''s remarks against Sonia.

""She is our leader. How do you expect us to keep quiet if someone attacks her,"" he asked.

Shinde said both the Congress and the NCP were working together as constituents of the DF government.

""Deputy chief minister Chhagan Bhujbal had stated that the NCP was joining hands with us to ensure that secular forces came to power in the state,"" he said.

Shinde said the Congress was making many ""sacrifices"" to keep fundamentalist forces out of power and stated that the NCP should exercise some restraint.

The chief minister clarified that the Congress would not tolerate any attack on Sonia. ""We don''t want to remain in the government at the cost of our leader,"" he said. Shinde said the Congress would be forced to do a re-think on snapping ties with the NCP if it remained ""rigid"" on Sonia''s origin.

11,Revised rules for ship-dismantling,"BANGKOK: A tripartite International Labour Organisation (ILO) meeting taking place here has made progress in revising guidelines aimed at responsible ship-dismantling while ensuring improved safety and health.

Representatives from government, employersâ€™ and workersâ€™ groups from Bangladesh, China, India, Pakistan and Turkey are working on the guidelines with the support of experts on international standards from Canada, the Republic of Korea, Norway and US. Experts backed an additional provision, proposed by the US, to deal with the preparation of emergency plans that will provide useful guidance for emergency situations arising in shipbreaking operations.

Participants agreed that night work was hazardous. However, it was acknowledged that at some sites it was impractical to avoid varying levels of night work due to a number of factors. Participants agreed that night work, if carried out, should comply with ILO conventions and recommendations.

Carl A. Halgren, occupational safety and health administration, US department of labour, said: â€˜â€˜The guidelines will be solid and, if followed, will lead to improved occupational safety and health in shipbreaking operations. It is important to recognise that different authorities will have to try and implement them within different frameworks, but ultimately the guidelines will provide a useful base upon which to build.â€™â€™

â€˜â€˜Shipbreaking on the beaches in Asian countries represents the downside of globalisation,â€™â€™ says ILO expert Paul Bailey. â€˜â€˜After industrialised countries of the western world are through with their ships, they get scrapped on beaches without dry-dock facilities or safety measures for workers. The challenge facing us is how this can be done in a safer manner. It will never be perfect but improvements can be made, and the guidelines under consideration this week will hopefully represent a practical development.â€™â€™

The meeting aims at the establishment of sound national frameworks for responsible ship dismantling and the provision of support for improved safety and health in shipbreaking by applying relevant ILO international instruments and codes of practice. Effective shipbreaking largely depends on how the vessel is prepared for dismantling.

Though the maritime industry is well-regulated, the end of a vesselâ€™s life and its dismantling are not comprehensively covered. An award-winning video, produced by the ILO, was shown during the second day of the meeting. The Shipbreakers looks at the shipbreaking yards of Bangladesh and India, where workers can be unwitting victims of gas explosions or tons of falling steel.

13,"Jamalpur by-polls a test of strength for Cong, BJP","AHMEDABAD: Sudden announcement of by-election in Jamalpur Assembly constituency on December 1, the day of Assembly polls in four other states, has caught both the BJP and the Congress unawares.

The abrupt announcement has made this second byelection, to be held in a single year of the BJP regime, a trial of strength for the two main political forces in the state. The by-election has been necessitated by the recent death of the sitting Congress member Usmangani Devdiwala last week, who represented this constituency for three consecutive times, twice as an Independent and last time as a Congress member.

Though both the Congress and the BJP camps have not yet begun any deliberations over selection of candidates, preliminary reports indicate the Congress might field late Devdiwalaâ€™s son Imtiyaz, an aide of his late father in political and social activities. The BJP, meanwhile, is contemplating to deviate from its usual practice of putting up a Dalit leader.

Jamalpurâ€™s rich Chhipa community, to which late Devdiwala belonged, has made a strong representation to the GPCC leadership in favour of Imtiyaz Devdiwala. He enjoys faith and confidence of the Chhipa Jamaat with a strong 35,000 population base, the representatives said. Prior to Devdiwalaâ€™s first stint in the Assembly in 1995, the constituency was traditionally represented by late Lalbhai Kundiwala, who had earned reputation among the Chhipas.

But at the same time a section of Congress workers have reportedly staked claims of their leaders.This included the former Congress minister Dr Sirajuddin Kazi, former chairman of the standing committee Badruddin Shaikh and city mayor Aneesa Mirza. Meanwhile, the names doing the rounds in the BJP camp are former chairman of standing committee of AMC Dharmendra Shah, sitting BJP corporator Nishaben Jha and the former president of Ahmedabad Medical Association, Dr Parimal Desai.

It is strongly believed that this time over the party would not succumb to pressure from Dalit lobby as an influential leader of community Chaturdas Tundia lost twice against Devdiwala in 1995 and in 1998 Assembly polls. â€œEven in the worst case scenario if the BJP was forced to consider a proposal of Dalit workers including Chaturdas Tundia and former city mayor Laljibhai Parmar as their candidate, the party would portray the candidate as â€œDalit Hinduâ€� to garner votes,â€� senior BJP minister said. The city BJP president Dr Mayaben Kodnani said the first meeting of the election committee will meet by the end of this week after the minister of state for home Harin Pathak arrives Friday.

â€œWe havenâ€™t decided on any parameters for selection of candidates but certainly a strategy to snatch this seat from the Congress would be chalked out,â€� she said. Jamalpur constituency has 55 per cent Hindu and 45 per centMuslim population and majority of its Hindus voters belong to Dalit section. This has been the major reason why the BJP has been fielding a Dalit leader all this while. But the philanthropic activities of late Devdiwala had twice succeeded in wooing the Dalits resulting in defeats for BJPâ€™s Dalit candidate Chaturdas Tundia.

Among the 45 per cent Muslims, the Chhipas have been dominating with 35,000 votes and others contribute 20,000 in Jamalpur, which is one of the largest constituencies stretching upto Karnamukteshwar temple in Raipur to Ram-Rahim tekra of Dani Limda. It covers three major municipal wards including that of Jamalpur, Behrampura and Kankaria. All the three seats have been won by Independents supported by Devdiwala in Jamalpur municipal ward while in Behrampura, the Congress has captured three seats in last civic election when the BJP lost power in municipal corporation. In the adjoining Kankaria ward Dharmendra Shah and two other BJP candidates had won in 2000. Meanwhile, the Election Commission has announced the schedule.

The filing of nominations will start November 7 and go on till November 14. The last date for withdrawal will be November 17 with the polls on December 1. This is the second Assembly by-election after Songadh reserved seat,which was by Kantilal Gamit of BJP. After the death of Devdiwala, the strength of the various political parties is: BJP Congress 49, Janata Dal-Independents 2.

14,LDF meets to discuss political developments,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Leaders of the Left Democratic Front in Kerala met here on Tuesday to take stock of the political situation in the state in the wake of the demand voiced by a section in the state Congress for Chief Minister A K Antony''s replacement and to discuss its plan to give notice for the removal of Assembly Speaker Vakkom Purushothaman.

16,Rising number of suicides alarms Rajkot residents,"RAJKOT: The suicide graph has been climbing in Rajkot this year with figures showing an alarming trend. As many as 365 persons committed suicide in the city between January and September this year.

Of them, 120 were young married women who were driven to take the extreme step due to rising cases of marital discord and economic hardship. Police records show that young women have taken to self-immolation to end their lives and that even minor girls and aged women were not behind.

During the said period, 27 minor girls and 26 aged women ended their lives. The local civil hospital recorded 215 cases of death due to burns and postmortem conducted on the bodies showed a majority of the cases as that of suicide. Records also show that more males consumed poison to end their lives than through self-immolation.Police reports of 2003 show that 67 males ended their lives by consuming poison. Fifty-six of them were youngsters and 11 middleaged men.

There were 52 females who consumed poison to kill themselves. Of them, as many as 36 were young women and eight minors. Of the 365 suicides recorded in the nine-month period, a majority of the victims (214) succumbed to burns. There were 121 cases where victims died after consuming poison and 30 hung themselves. Those who hung themselves during the period were 19 males and 11 females.

The males included 15 youths and four middleaged, whereas the females included nine young married women and two middle-aged women. Some also committed suicide by plunging themselves into wells or reservoirs or even before trains. A study conducted by a social organisation indicated that issues like economic hardship, rising unemployment and failure in love have contributed to the rise in suicide cases among males.

Marital discord, incompatibility and problems arising out of dowry-related issues have led to more women committing suicide. Reprimand from parents or even quarrel among siblings have led minors to end their lives. Reports show that cases of suicide by women by self-immolation were high in February and again in April-May though no specific reason is available for such a phenomenon.

17,State govt forced to take a fresh look at power reforms policy,"GANDHINAGAR: Mounting pressure from populist lobbies against power sector reforms, mainly from farmers and the Gujarat Electricity Board (GEB) employees, has forced the state government to take a fresh view of the situation. It will seek to clarify the changes that will come about once the new the Central Electricity Act, 2003 comes into force on December 10.

And almost all in the Sachivalay agree that private investors would enter the power sector only if they knew what reforms mean for them. One area which, officials claim, held out some hope for fresh investment during the recent Vibrant Gujarat investorsâ€™ meet was power sector.

Credible proposals worth Rs 13,270 crore were received for setting up seven power plants with a capacity of 3,813 MW from Torrent, Nirma, G-Pec, Essar. A separate proposal from BSES (or Reliance Energy) awaits clearance. But without a clearly defined policy, fear is that things would remain only on paper. The problem has got worse with lack of clarity in the top circles over the â€œopen accessâ€� offered to the consumers and distributors of power by the new Electricity Act.

In fact, no such provision in the state Act passed in the Assembly last year exists. Even if the Central Act supersedes the state Act wherever the two contradict, the view is strong that distribution of power should solely remain in state hands. In fact, the agreements reached with the GEB employees on Monday suggests exactly that. Although the current GEB distribution network may be split into four â€” north, south, western and central â€” but it will continue to remain in state hands. The GEBâ€™s planned corporatisation has no provision for privatising the monopoly distribution network, believed to be crucial for the power reform.

In fact, any privatisation of a GEB utility would have to get fresh approval from Assembly. â€œOpen access to a private player would have three main conditions,â€� revealed a top official. â€œFirstly, there will be wheeling charges for moving power from one point to another. Secondly, the consumer will have to bear the brunt of crosssubsidisation. And thirdly, there will be an additional surcharge to compensate for the hardware that the GEB developed for using the existing transmission and distribution network.â€� The state officialdom also gives a period of â€œat least six yearsâ€� before the â€œopen accessâ€� promised in the Central Act is implemented at all.

And the Gujarat Electricity Regulatory Commission (GERC) has been allowed one year to prepare an action plan for this. â€œIndications from the Centre are that it will take at least five years for allowing open access to a consumer,â€� said a senior official. â€œEven in UK it took 10 years to implement the reforms. Leapfrogging is just impossibleâ€� The private power generators may require no license to produce power, as specified in the Central Act, but will have to â€œcompletely depend on the current GEB facilities for distribution.â€� The private players can â€œtheoretically have their own distribution network, but it is not going to be an easy task,â€� an official admitted.

In governmentâ€™s view, it is not â€œopen accessâ€� that would determine new investment. â€œOpen access has more to do with consumer choice, not investment. The three factors that will determine investment are â€” market for energy, payments security and the overall environment,â€� said a senior official. Any private player will have to cover the subsidies under which the GEB operates. And this would make the investments uneconomical.

19,EC to govt: No more bragging,"NEW DELHI: This would surely spoil the NDA celebrating four years in power and could start yet another round of squabbling between the Election Commission and the government.

On Tuesday, the EC told the government firmly that highlighting its achievements after October 6, the day the dates for the assembly elections in five states were announced, amounts to a violation of the model code of conduct.

The ECâ€™s directive also challenges I&B minister Ravi Shankar Prasadâ€™s claim that issuing advertisements commemorating four years of the NDA governmentâ€™s rule is not violative of the code since they only talk about the achievements of the Central government. But the EC does not agree. Mincing no words, it wrote to the Cabinet secretary and I&B secretary, stating: â€˜â€˜With the announcement of elections on October 6, the model code of conduct came into force immediately.

The display of such advertisements at the cost of the public exchequer constitutes a clear violation of the code.â€™â€™ The EC felt that the advertisement campaign would provide an â€˜â€˜undue advantageâ€™â€™ to the party in power and could influence voters in its favour.

It said it has taken note of direct and indirect advertisements highlighting the achievements of the party in power being displayed through ads in newspapers and TV spots. â€˜â€˜How can the Centre say that the advertisements only talk about its achievements? Arenâ€™t these being displayed in newspapers in five states going to the polls?â€™â€™ an EC official asked.

The EC directed the Centre that no advertisement with the objective of furthering the interests of the party in power should be issued at the cost of the public exchequer during the election period in all editions of newspapers and TV channels published/telecast from the five states by any department, agency or public undertaking of the Centre.

20,'Sop for bajra farmers not poll-related',"NEW DELHI: Union food minister Sharad Yadav on Monday denied that the relaxation in the norms for bajra crop procurement, announced by the Centre, had been done in view of the coming assembly elections in Rajasthan.

Speaking to reporters, Yadav said: â€˜â€˜There was no election earlier when we increased the relaxation in the norms from two per cent to five per cent. Then why should the move to further relax it to seven per cent be considered as being done in view of the elections?â€™â€™

He argued that the decision was taken in order to mitigate the hardship of the Rajashtan farmers, who had been reeling under drought-like conditions continuously for the past four years. He also said that there was a request for this from the state government as well as all political parties in the state.

â€˜â€˜It has been decided that the government procuring agencies, including the Food Corporation of India, will now procure bajra containing upto 7.5 per cent slightly damaged/discoloured grain instead of 2.5 per cent provided in the uniform specifications,â€™â€™ Yadav said.

21,Court makes new rules for witness protection,"NEW DELHI: The Delhi High Court on Tuesday issued certain guidelines to the police to provide protection to witnesses in cases pertaining to life imprisonment or death sentence.

The ruling is an attempt to check witnesses from turning hostile under threats from accused. The guidelines have been issued by Justices Usha Mehra and Pradeep Nandrajog on a petition filed by Neelam Katara whose son Nitish was allegedly murdered by Rajya Sabha MP D P Yadavâ€™s son Vikas and nephew Vishal in February last year.

The court has also made it compulsory for the investigating officer of a case to inform the witness about the new guidelines. â€˜â€˜When a witness gives his statement to the police, the investigating officer has to tell him/her about the competent authority who can be approached in the wake of a threat,â€™â€™ the court said.

The court has appointed the member-secretary of the Delhi Legal Services Authority as the competent authority. The member secretary will have the power to decide â€˜â€˜whether a witness requires police protection or not.â€™â€™ While asking the government to give due publicity to the guidelines, the high court said its order would operate until a legislation is enacted. While granting permission to protect a witness, the competent authority shall take into account the nature of security risk to him/her from the accused.

22,Police raid Daler's Delhi farmhouse,"DELHI\PATIALA: A joint Delhi-Punjab Police team raided the Nangloi farmhouse of singer Daler Mehndi on Tuesday morning in connection with the immigration racket involving his brother, Shamsher.

23,SC reserves judgement on building by-laws,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday reserved its judgment on the Centre''s application seeking vacation of a two-year-old order staying an official notice allowing additional floor area ratio (FAR) for residential houses in Delhi.

A Bench comprising of Justices Rajendra Babu and G P Mathur earlier heard in detail arguments by additional solicitor-general Mukul Rohtagi and Ranjit Kumar, who assisted the court in the matter.

On December 11, 2001, the court had stayed implementation of the Centre''s press note issued on November 27, 2001, on Ranjit Kumar''s contention that it allowed additional floors.

The court had said that this would put more pressure on the already strained infrastructure like sewage, road and water facilities and added that additional floors could not be allowed to be constructed without first augmenting the civic facilities.

Rohtagi said an erroneous impression was created to the effect that the government was allowing an additional dwelling unit in the existing residential unit.

He said the government had allowed only a small increase in the FAR allowing the top floor to have an additional room keeping in mind that families were growing and were crammed for space.
