0,HC admits riot victims's plea against police inaction,"AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat High Court has admitted the plea of a riot victim challenging police inaction in arresting those accused of attacking him, and who still continue to harass and prevent him from resuming business.

Victim Saiyed Yunusmiya Nathumiya of Visnagar (Mehsana district) contended that police had failed in protecting him, in taking timely action and thus deprived him of his fundamental rights, and is therefore seeking compensation.

The victim''s cycle repair shop was looted, ransacked and burnt down on February 28, by a mob of over 50 persons.

Justice DH Vaghela admitted the petition and has set it up for hearing in October. HC has directed the respondents - secretary home department, director-general of police, district superintendent of police Mehsana and police inspector Visnagar police station - to file affidavits. Advocate Hashim Qureshi appeared for the petitioner.

Identifying three accused with names and other details, the petitioner claimed that he took refuge a little away from his shop and saw how it was robbed and burnt. He said the police had registered a common complaint instead of noting his individual complaint despite repeated requests.

The police made a panchanama and the petitioner hoped that action by the police would help normalise the situation and help him resume business.

Saiyed complained that the police had not taken any action in pursuance to the complaint and the accused - who are restraining the petitioner from resuming business - have not yet been arrested. He stated that they are preventing him from resuming business and are moving about freely in the town alleging that police has been facilitating that.

1,BJP leaders target Cong at jan jagran rally,"VARANASI: An impressive crowd came to attend the â€˜jan jagranâ€™ rally organised by the Bharatiya Janata Party at Beniabagh ground on Wednesday. The national president of the party Venkaiah Naidu, general secretary Rajnath Singh and the state chief of the party Vinay Katiyar were among the galaxy of leaders present on the dais.

Not only the atmosphere surcharged, but the enthusiasm among the BJP workers was also witnessed as the leaders spoke on issues like Ram Mandir, Kashi Vishwanath temple, Article 370 and Uniform Civil Code. Naidu, who highlighted the partyâ€™s ideology in the begining, started getting loud applause from the crowd when he touched the sensitive issues including Gujaratâ€™s gaurav yatra.

Naidu asked that when Narendra Modi accepted the challenge of opposition of tendering resignation from the chief ministership and turned to the people for elections, then why the Congress was running away. â€œWhat was the fault of Modi government. Had the riots not taken place in those states where Congress or other parties were in power? he questioned.

He also cornered the Election Commission and said that it had adopted double standards in Gujarat. There were over two lakh people in refugee camps in Kashmir and assembly elections were being conducted there, he said adding that in Gujarat, where only 8.000 people were in the camps, the situation was being posed as critical to avoid elections.

Making the partyâ€™s stand clear Naidu said, â€œthere is no question of leaving the issues like Ram Mandir, Article 370 and Uniform Civil Code by the BJP.â€� The BJP was leading an alliance, so it was bound to follow the agenda of NDA. If people wanted to see the meterialisation of these issue, they should bring the BJP in power with full majority, he said.

Firing salvos at opposition for their allegation of saffronisation of education, Naidu challenged them to make their stand clear.

Addressing the rally, the state president Vinay Katiyar said that the Muslims would have to understand that by maintaining distance with BJP no problem could be solved. He also assured the partymen that no compromise would be made with their self-respect in running the BSP-led state government.

It was the national general secretary and former chief minister of UP, Rajnath Singh who stole the show. Amid loud applause Singh made repeated attacks on Congress and stated the party which created a series of scams was raising fingers on the Vajpayee government.

He claimed that the BJP had emerged as the largest political organisation of the world with three crore members. Important among those who addressed the rally were ministers, Lalji Tandon, Om Prakash Singh, former UP finance minister, Harishchandra Srivastava, Kalraj Mishra and Satyadev Singh.

3,Doctors given incentives to end private practice,"LUCKNOW: Elated at his newfound status as the â€˜firstâ€™ Vice-Chancellor of the Chhatrapati Shahuji Maharaj Medical University, Dr KM Singh proudly announced on Wednesday that he would ensure the presence of consultants and residents in the out-patient and emergency departments, adding that all the training and teaching programmes of UG and PG and super-speciality courses would be strictly followed. However, he was â€œnoncommittalâ€� on putting a â€œblanket banâ€� on private practice of doctors. But the question is how would he fulfil the said promises and bring â€œinfluentialâ€� doctors, neck-deep in private practice, to work?

â€œIn two years we will be in a position to provide ample monetary incentives and enough salaries to the staff that they would automatically stop private practice,â€� said Dr Singh, while talking to mediapersons. He got the â€˜interimâ€™ vice-chancellorship by virtue of being the principal of the King Georgeâ€™s Medical College, which was recently elevated to that of a medical university by the state government. Plans are to make the university a super speciality institute with a grant of over Rs 600 crore. Around Rs 16 crore has been sanctioned by the government in the first phase.

A day after being conferred with the new status, the university campus wore a festive look on Wednesday. A new sign board adorned the main gate, roads were being laid and lawns were spruced up for the occasion. Employees were busy bursting crackers and exchanging greetings. Most of them were happy that the new status would mean more money in terms of grant, which eventually, they felt would benefit them.

The acting V-C added that transfer of Provincial Health Institute, Blood Bank and School of Nursing under the university administration would be his top priority. Other immediate plans include improvement of general cleanliness on the campus, regulation of parking of vehicles and improvement of waiting places for attendants, he said.

Dr Singh said in the near future a modern communication system with internal PBX and centralisation of total computer network of the hospital and the college would be effected. Also in the offing are a modern central laundry and a central kitchen. Installation of central generator for the whole hospital and operating theatres and emergency complex are also on the cards. The building at Shahmina road to start an ultramodern 100-bed running emergency service would be completed within six months.

Fernandes inaugurated Dr Ram Manohar Lohia Meeting Hall constructed in the block office premises in Hilsa.

Local people came up before the minister with several grievances, including power shortage. Fernandes, however, blamed state government for this. Rajya Sabha member Rajiv Ranjan alias Lalan Singh and several Samata Party leaders were also present in the public meetings.

Addressing a public meeting at Islampur, Fernandes criticised the state government for its failure in improving the power scenario in the state.

He, however, appreciated the work of railway minister Nitish Kumar and said it was because of Nitishâ€™s efforts that Fatuha-Islampur rail section could be completed in such a short time.

George said that the union energy minister Suresh Prabhu had sanctioned Rs 20 crore to Bihar for energy generation but the state government could not provide land for this purpose. George also talked about several crucial issues, including the assembly elections in Jammu and Kashmir and the deployment of Army personnel on Indo-Pak border.

Rajiv Ranjan, on the occasion, promised to allot funds from MPâ€™s quota for construction of a Town Hall at Islampur. This was demanded by the local people for long. Nalanda MLA Shrawan Kumar, Asthawan MLA Satish Kumar and other local leaders of Samata Party were also present.

6,"3 MCC men arrested, landmine recovered","DARBHANGA: Darbhanga police arrested three activists of the Maoist Coordination Centre (MCC) at Hayaghat railway station on Tuesday evening. Police also recovered huge quantities of MCC literature, documents, pamphlets and diaries from their possession.

An interrogation of the accused led to the recovery of one fully charged live landmine, two empty containers and seven detonators besides large quantity of wire from a village under Hayaghat police station. â€œThis is for the first time that landmines and detonators have been recovered from the MCC men in the north Bihar,â€� informed Darbhanga SP Sudhanshu Kumar while addressing a press conference here on Wednesday.

Those arrested include, Umesh Manjhi of village Mannupur Kharra under Hayaghat police station, Pavan Yadav of village Balia under Simri police station and Bachhelal Choupal of village Radhiyam under Bahera police station. â€œUmesh Manjhi is a B.Sc. student of local C M Science College,â€� said the SP. Manjhi used to reside either in hostel meant for scheduled caste students at Mogalpura locality in Darbhanga town or in New Delhi and clandestinely indulged in MCC activities. The frail looking boy was the mastermind behind devising landmine and detonators, the SP further said.

Giving a detailed account of the search operation, the SP said that a couple of days ago the MCC cadres had planned a meeting at village Kharra. However, the police got a tip off and launched combing operation to nab the extremists.

Following the police pressure, the MCC men postponed their programme. Some of them moved to other places and concealed their arms and ammunitions in the nearby localities, Kumar said.

In the meantime, station incharge of the Hayaghat PS got a tip off that three MCC extremists were waiting at the Hayaghat railway station to catch a train. The police force swung into action and nabbed the three at railway platform and recovered MCC literature from their baggage. An interrogation of the accused revealed that they had come to participate in the proposed meeting.

7,Rudy calls upon youth to wage battle against Rabri govt,"MUZAFFARPUR: Union minister Rajiv Pratap Rudy called upon the youths of Bihar here recently to wage a decisive battle against the â€œinactive, corrupt and autocraticâ€� government of Bihar for the sake of allround development of the state.

Speaking at a three-hour-long â€˜virat yuva adalatâ€™ of Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha in Ramdayalu Memorial Hall, the young BJP leader said that people employed in the state government are going to get the biggest shock of their life as they would not get their salary after a few years.

The Bihar government has also failed to provide basic infrastructure to most of the districts of Bihar, he added. Bihar has forgotten its movement against injustice, said Rudy and urged the party workers to throw out this government.

He also asked the partymen to go to villages and take the majority people into confidence. He defended the disinvestment policy of his government and said that all big industries had been set up with public money but the then Congress government had made them non-viable by employing â€œ3000 in place of 300â€� jobs in majority of them. Now the NDA government would have to make capital efficiency and bring in a reform.

Only those people are opposing the government move who were taking undue benefits from it, the minister said. Referring to reports of rift in NDA, he said no NDA partner had any grievance against the BJP.

Earlier, Navin Kishore Sinha MLA, state president of Bhartiya Janata Yuva Morcha, Mangal Pandey, district BJP president Lal Mohan Singh, State BJP Udyog Manch president Suresh Sharma, and Radha Mohan Singh, MP, criticised the Bihar government for misutilising crores of rupees given to it by the Centre.

8,Transport stir ends; govt agrees to slash road tax,"PATNA: The 49-day-long transportersâ€™ strike ended on Tuesday, with the state government finally conceding ground to the agitating transporters by slashing more than half the hiked road tax announced from August 1 in the wake of presidential assent to the Bihar Finance Bill, 2001.

The government also agreed not to impose road tax on bus owners for the tax period or impose fines on them for non-payment of tax. It was agreed that those bus owners who had either sought NOC or surrendered their buses would withdraw their applications.

The decision to withdraw the transport strike from Thursday morning was announced by the president of Bihar Motor Transport Federation, Uday Shankar Prasad, after a marathon meeting held at the CMâ€™s house from 12 noon to 6 pm.

RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav, members of the cabinet sub-committee on economic affairs, transport minister Awadh Bihari Choudhary, top government officials besides a large number of transporters were present. According to the agreement reached during the meeting, the state government will revise the tax hike as contained in the Bihar Finance Bill, 2001.

Buses covering 400-km per day, who were supposed to pay Rs 68,000 quarterly, will now have to pay Rs 32,000 as road tax. Buses plying upto 300-km per day will have to pay Rs 27,000 quarterly instead of Rs 52,000. Buses plying upto 200-km per day will now have to pay only Rs 16,000 quarterly instead of Rs 35,000.

Buses plying upto 100-kms per day will have to pay Rs 11,000 quarterly instead of Rs 18,000. RJD supremo said that the government slashed road tax after the transporters agreed not to hike fares. â€œThere will be no burden on passengers,â€� he remarked, adding that the government had reversed its decision on road tax 7hike in the interest of the people and transporters.

9,Facts bely govt claim on power,"HYDERABAD: The state government, Transco, and the power distribution companies (discoms) claim that the spurt in demand for power in the past few days is due to increased agricultural consumption. However, facts appear to point otherwise.

The government and the power utilities say the state has 22,08,766 agricultural pump connections and calculate the power consumed by the farm sector on the basis of this number. But the truth, according to sources, lies elsewhere.

â€˜Only just about half of these pumps are in use,â€™â€™ a source said. That not all the agricultural pumps are used by farmers was also corroborated by the vice-president of the Federation of Farmersâ€™ Associations, Andhra Pradesh, A Bhavani Prasad.

â€œMost farmers who do not use the pumps because of lack of ground water or because they have not planted crops due to drought, do not surrender their connections. So these pumps are also counted as drawing power,â€™â€™ he added. The farmers do not surrender the connections and instead pay the required charges because once a service is disconnected, the discoms do not restore supply.

The fact that of the 50,000 promised new connections for the year ending March 2001, only about 13,000 connections were released till July this year, bears out the fears of farmers.

Interestingly, a study by the AP Productivity Council, carried out on agricultural power connections for APERC, placed the number of such active connections at just around 10 lakh. If one were to go by the APPCfigure, then the power consumed by the farm sector works out to around 5,000 million units a year and not around 10,000 million units as claimed by Transco and the discoms.

The fact is that the discoms are yet to present detailed figures of these pumpsets to the APERC, the source said. Since the discoms themselves are not clear as to just how many pumpsets exist, the argument that power consumption has shot up does not hold water, the source added.

15,Karnataka stops Cauvery water to TN after farmer's suicide,"BANGALORE: In an apparent attempt to defuse the heightening unrest in Karnataka sparked by the release of Cauvery water to Tamil Nadu, the state government on Thursday decided to shut the crest gates of Kabini reservoir to stop water flow and convene an emergency session of legislature on September 24 to discuss the crisis.

The state Cabinet that held an emergency meeting on Thursday also ordered a judicial probe into the death of Beechanahalli gram panchayat member who jumped into Kabini waters on Wednesday to protest the Karnataka''s release of water to Tamil Nadu.

16,Cong takes EC line on Gujarat elections,"NEW DELHI: While the Congress and the Election Commission followed the same line of argument on the presidential reference emanating from Gujarat poll crisis, BJP got the support of AIADMK-run Tamil Nadu government on Thursday.

Addressing a five-judge Constitution Bench hearing the 11th presidential reference seeking the apex courtâ€™s opinion on three issues, Tamil Naduâ€™s counsel Kailash Vasudev challenged the argument by ECâ€™s counsel K K Venugopal that the reference should be returned unanswered. In the written submissions, the Jayaâ€™s government said Presidentâ€™s rule could not be imposed in Gujarat as EC itself has said elections could not take place in the state.

The day-long hearing witnessed Congress counsel Kapil Sibal alleging that the reference was a â€˜â€˜slantâ€™â€™ and had a motive behind it. As solicitor- general Harish N Salve strongly objected to the Congress casting aspersion on the constitutional authority, the Bench took an exception to Sibalâ€™s allegation and asked him to refrain from using such expressions since it was signed by â€˜â€˜the highest constitutional authorityâ€™â€™.

The Bench said, â€˜â€˜Donâ€™t take such an extreme view. Look at the document; it is signed by the constitutional authority. We have to proceed on the basis of the same, which has been referred to us,â€™â€™ Chief Justice B N Kirpal said. The other judges hearing the reference are Justices V N Khare, K G Balakrishnan, Ashok Bhan and Arijit Pasayat.

Sibal said his comments were not aimed at â€˜â€˜the office of the Presidentâ€™â€™ but were related to the context of questions and the manner in which the issue was handled by the Centre.

â€˜â€˜I have not attributed any motive to the President for whom we have great regard. What I said was that the government order is signed by a â€˜titularâ€™ head,â€™â€™ Sibal said.

BJP counsel Arun Jaitley said EC has no authority to postpone the elections. â€˜â€˜The EC cannot take upon itself the power of deferring the polls which is not cast upon it under the Article 324 of the Constitution,â€™â€™ he said.

Jaitley, a former law minister, said empowering EC with such powers would defeat the scheme of the Constitution which only provides it the authority of controlling, superintendence, directing the poll process.

Jaitley said Article 324 was undefined and if it remained so, it could lead to a constitutional crisis in future also. Counsel said the legislative assembly, after its dissolution, has to be convened within six months of its last sitting under Article 174 so that a responsive government is in place.

When such a situation has arisen, a reasonable concession would be to start the poll process within six months and conduct the election as provided under the Representation of People Act which gives a time of five weeks to complete the process, Jaitley added.

Sibal said if election in an extra-ordinary situation could not be held within the six-month time-frame, EC had the power to defer the process beyond this limit.

He supporting the ECâ€™s August 16 order deferring the Gujarat election to November-December. Sibal said the Constitution was silent on holding elections within a particular time-frame as Article 174 only talked about a six-month time limit between two sittings of the assembly and not about how the polls should be conducted.

17,UK rules out isolating Pak in war against terror,"MUMBAI: Britain on Thursday strongly disfavoured ""isolating"" Pakistan in the international coalition against terrorism, saying the recent arrest of al-Qaeda activists in Pakistan showed that different nations could make important contribution in fighting the menace.

Refusing to divulge details, he said the talks were ""very fruitful"" and was glad that Advani in his speech at the award ceremony favoured dialogue to resolve the bilateral problems with Pakistan.

19,Did Guruswamy want to fake a suicide?,"KABINI: Forty-three-year-old Guruswamy had little inkling of what the fate had in store when he set out on Wednesday morning to mobilise women protesters in his bid to force the government's hand on the Cauvery river water dispute. Force the government's hand he did, and in a manner he had not even contemplated.Guruswamy, who is survived by his wife, a daughter and a son, was a happy-go-lucky man. Apart from agriculture that earned him bread and butter, he involved himself in social activities earning a good name among the villagers. He had conducted his daughter's marriage this summer.Villagers said he was a promising politician and ``an asset'' to the Congress, the party he worked for. His grieving daughter Manjula said: ``He started the day early in the morning, to mobilise protesters. He said he would have breakfast on his return. That was not to be.''Villagers, including his relative Gurumallaiah who vouch for the popularity of Guruswamy and his active participation in village activities as head of the Veerashaiava Yuva Vedike, said the villagers at no point of time had discussed jumping into the river.``It (jumping into the river) was not on our agenda. Nor did we discuss it. Maybe Guruswamy might have taken this extreme step on the spur of the moment,'' said Shivalingu, who jumped into the river along with Guruswamy but was fortunate enough to be rescued.He added: ``Since all of us could swim, we surmised we would reach the shore safe. But Guruswamy got swept away by swift currents and met a watery grave.''This point was corroborated by the police officials but from a different perspective __ the politically ambitious Guruswamy was tipped for the post of president of Beechanahalli Gram Panchayat and therefore had no intention of giving up his life on the altar of Cauvery. Police said he told fellow-protesters that he would leap into the river and swim to a village downstream.Confirming this, Deputy Superintendent of Police Mandappa said Guruswamy proposed to ``fake a suicide'' to pressure the dam engineers to stop the release of water, and not actually commit suicide.
