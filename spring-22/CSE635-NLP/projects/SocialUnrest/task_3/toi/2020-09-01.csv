0,"Keep off Mandvi, Modi tells ministers","GANDHINAGAR: Chief Minister Narendra Modi has surprised his ministerial colleagues by telling them at a Cabinet meeting on Monday morning that they need not all queue up to attend the grand show at Mandvi on September 4 when the ashes of revolutionary Shyamji Krishnavarma reach his home-town.

Mandvi, the home-town of Shyamji in Kutch district, will host deputy prime minister L K Advani on Shyamji''s 146th birth anniversary at the function. ""It is not necessary for all ministers to come right up to Mandvi,"" the CM was quoted as saying by one of his ministers. Modi simultaneously instructed his colleagues not to come in their official cars individually.

""One car should carry more than one minister,"" the CM was also quoted as saying. The bid is seen as Modi''s attempt to show to Advani and two other ministers likely to be present at the Mandvi function that his government believed in austerity. Significantly, the Mandvi function would be the culmination of mass-level functions at 400 different places in 17 districts in the memory of Shyamji.

At all these places, state-sponsored meetings were held at government expense to pay homage to the ashes of Shyamji and that of his wife Bhanumati, stored in two separate marble urns. Modi brought the urns from Geneva on August 24 to fulfil Shyamji''s last wish to send his ashes to India only after the nation gained independence.

Shyamji died in Geneva in 1930 after his nationalist activities mainly in London and Paris.

This is the second time in a row that the CM has tried to avoid his colleagues in a grand public function.

Earlier, at Patan, where he headed the grand Independence Day celebrations, he instructed all his colleagues to go to their respective districts to hoist flags.

Said a senior official, ""The CM appeared to give the impression that he did not want to see his ministerial colleagues'' faces all the time. Besides, he knows, organisers find it difficult to organise big functions at small places.""

If at Patan, all top IAS bureaucrats were asked to remain present, for Mandvi this would not be so. Unlike Patan, for Mandvi no official instructions have been issued for the officials to be around at the function at the Kutchi town. ""We have already paid homage to Shyamji at Gandhinagar,"" a top official said. ''We were all asked to be present. What''s the point in now going to Mandvi?""

Hailing from Mandvi, former chief minister Suresh Mehta will chair the function at G T Grounds, from where the urns will be taken to Limdavali Sheri and kept at the small house where Shyamji was born. A grand procession accompanied by a musical band will take the urn to Shyamji''s birthplace. ""Children have been asked to write essays on Shyamji,"" Mehta said. ""The BJP''s youth wing has organised nationalist songs for Tuesday and Wednesday.""

2,Daman protests spill over to Silvassa,"SURAT: Even as the Union territory of Daman limps back to normalcy, with schools still remaining closed and the death toll in Thursdayâ€™s bridge collapse touching 30 with another body being recovered, neighbouring Silvassa observed a bandh on Monday, called by political parties and social organisations.

Body of seven-year-old Joshina George, the last of the missing persons, was found on Sunday evening.

Protests against the Daman administration, which is being blamed for not maintaining the bridge over Damanganga leading to its collapse, continued as a huge rally, comprising over 4,000 school children, was taken out in Silvassa on Monday. Prayer meets were held for all those who died in the bridge collapse.

Silvassa MP Mohan Delkar told TNN that the rallyists demanded fitness assessment of all bridges and that of educational and other institutions in the region built in the Portuguese era. â€œI will raise the issue in the Parliament and all those responsible for poor maintenance of the bridge must be made accountable,â€� said Delkar.

Section 144 was lifted between 6 am and 12 noon in Daman on Monday even though vigil by Rapid Action Force (RAF) personnel and CRPF continued, police control room officials informed TNN.

While the Daman police have lodged an FIR against the public works department (PWD), which is responsible for the maintenance of the bridge, senior citizens and representatives of organisations in Daman convened a meeting on Monday and resolved to file a public interest litigation (PIL).PWD executive engineer Bharat Gupta was put under suspension pending investigation by the administration, Daman municipality president Vishal Tandel told TNN.

Locals also urged the administration to build a bridge connecting Nani Daman and Moti Daman without any delay as there are no means other than private boats to cross the river, said Tandel. A ferry service by the private agencies alongwith the Navyâ€™s ferry had been transporting people from Nani Daman to Moti Daman since Sunday.

The Lady Fatima Convent School, which lost a number of its students in the bridge collapse, was instructed by the administration to remain closed till further direction, said Sister Josephine Colwala.

The school was scheduled to open on Monday.

4,'Weak govt responsible for blasts',"MUMBAI: The Shiv Sena-BJP alliance used the second day of the ongoing Ganesh Chaturthi festival to launch a campaign against the Democratic Front government in Maharashtra by embarking on maha-aartis.

That the programme is clearly aimed at converting the Ganesh festival into a political campaign against the DF government became obvious on Monday evening at the sarvajanik Ganesh pandal opposite the Chembur golf course, where the first mahaaarti was held in the presence of a frenzied 3,000-strong crowd, mostly Shiv Sainiks. State BJP president Gopinath Munde and senior Sena leader Subhash Desai arrived at the pandal in a white Mercedes at about 7.20 p.m. and proceeded to a large plaster-of-Paris idol of Lord Ganesh.

The duo lit camphor in a stainless steel plate and began chanting the mahaaarti hymns. They were joined by Sena-BJP activists, who held their party flags aloft in front of the idol. Local BJP MP Kirit Somaiya was the cheerleader who egged on the mob to chant slogans against terrorism. Those participating in the maha-aarti included city BJP president Bhai Girkar, local BJP MLA Pramod Shirvalkar and Dattaram Gujar, north-east Mumbai district chief of the Sena.

Soon after the maha-aarti, Mr Munde,Mr Desai and others moved to an improvised dais in front of the Ganesh pandal and appealed to the people not to rely on the â€œincompetent government of (chief minister Sushilkumar) Shinde and (deputy CM) Chhagan Bhujbalâ€™â€™ for their security. Mr Munde insisted that the maha-aarti was not against the minorities. â€œMaha-aartis will be held across Maharashtra to focus attention on the Shinde-Bhujbal government which has failed in its primary task of providing safety to the people,â€™â€™ Mr Munde said.Mr Desai asked, â€œWhy are these blasts taking place only in Mumbai and not in Gujarat?

This is because we have a weak government in Maharashtra, whereas the Narendra Modi ministry in Gujarat knows how to tackle terrorists.â€™â€™ Meanwhile, city Congress chief Gurudas Kamat and party MP Murli Deora have condemned the maha-aarti campaign. â€œThe BJP, whose government in Delhi could not prevent a terrorist attack on Parliament House, has no moral right to blame the state government for the blasts.â€�

5,State govt faces saffron swipe from puja pandals,"MUMBAI: The Shiv Sena-Bhartiya Janata Party alliance used the second day of the ongoing Ganesh Chaturthi festival to launch a campaign against the Democratic Front government in Maharashtra by embarking on maha-aartis.

State BJP president Gopinath Munde and senior Shiv Sena leader Subhash Desai,who is known for his proximity to Sena executive president Uddhav Thackeray, held a maha-aarti programme at Chembur on Monday evening, exactly a week after the twin blasts rocked south Mumbai. Fifty-one people were killed in the twin blastsâ€” at the Gateway of India and at Zaveri Bazarâ€” while 178 were injured.

Initially, the Sena was reluctant to take part in the programme, mooted by the BJP. In fact, until Saturday night, there were strong indications that the Sena had persuaded its ally not to go ahead with the programme since it might heighten tensions in the city, which is still feeling the aftershocks of the serial blasts. But on Sunday, Mr Munde and other BJP leaders won over the Sena leadership, and both parties decided to hold mahaaartis from Monday onwards.

6,Angry partymen to lodge protest during BPCC chief's padyatra,"HAJIPUR: The proposed padyatra of Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee (BPCC) chief Ramjatan Sinha alongwith hundreds of Congress workers here on Tuesday may witness some unpleasant scenes as dozens of angry party workers have planned to register their protest before the BPCC chief against district unit president Raj Kishore Choudharyâ€™s alleged â€œindifferent attitudeâ€� towards the genuine party workers.

Dozens of dissatisfied party workers accused Choudhary of blatantly â€œoverlookingâ€� the grassroot worker in the party affairs. According to the party sources, BPCC chief Ramjatan Sinha is to lead the padyatra from Hajipur to different parts of district under the party campaign â€œChalo goan ki oreâ€�. He will be accompanied by hundreds of party workers. A number of important Congress leaders, including new recruit Nikhil Kumar â€” former Delhi police commissioner â€” are expected to take part in the padyatra.

According to party sources, the â€œneglectedâ€� party workers, mostly from the rural areas, would not only raise their voice against the district chief but may also indulge in vandalism. â€œTo expose the black deeds and unfair attitude of the district president towards a majority of party workers, including women activists, we have planned to take him to task before the BPCC chief,â€� disclosed a leader of the youth wing of the party.

The district president of the party, Raj Kishore Choudhary, could not be contacted despite several attempts. Sources in the district police, however, assured that no attempt to disturb the padyatra would be allowed at any cost.

7,Police fire in air to avert communal clash,"MADHUBANI: Police resorted to atleast five rounds of firing in the air besides indiscriminate lathicharge to control an allegedly irate mob in village Akuli under Arer police station of the district on Sunday.

According to sources, more than two dozen people have been injured in the police lathicharge. Some of the injured are undergoing treatment at Benipatti government hospital. Sources said that the trouble arose when dead body of one Sabina Khatoon, 85, of village Chatra was prevented from being buried in the graveyard located at village Akuli by members of other community on Saturday as there is a dispute over the Muslimsâ€™ claim of the graveyard land.

The Muslims sought the help of the district administration and the body was cremated on Sunday reportedly in presence of the DM and SP of Madhubani. Infuriated at this, members of the majority community attacked the police which, in turn, resorted first to lathicharge and then to firing in the air. When the mob retreated after police firing, the police beat the villagers mercilessly, sources alleged. The situation, though under control, is stated to be quite tense. Police and RAF have been deployed at the village to prevent further trouble. Altogether, 12 persons have been taken into custody so far, according to official sources.

8,It’s ‘picnic’ time for farmers again,"CHANDIGARH: The farmers participating in the Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) rally being held near Rose Garden roundabout here have made complete arrangements for their four-day stay.

The farmers, who came to Chandigarh on Monday morning, have already set up a cooking place, with municipal corporationâ€™s water tankers providing the water supply. Temporary toilets have come up on the road-side.

The farmers were spotted relaxing on the both sides of Jan Marg, near Cricket stadium roundabout and also near the bus stand. Kartar Singh, a farmer, said they had brought flour and vegetables and would cook their own food. We will relax here, he quipped.

Another farmer, Jarnail Singh, said they had everything here including water and food and now toilets had also been provided. â€˜â€˜The only thing which we require is wood for cooking, which we will cut from nearby trees.â€™â€™

Some were even seen chopping and collecting wood for fire near Jan Marg. Traffic hazards soon followed. With trucks and tempos parked on the roadside, the commuters had a tough time.

Some exasperated residents said, in a tongue-incheek manner, that it had become a usual affair for the farmers to use the city as â€˜more of a picnic spotâ€™.

About 45 bonded labours, who were sitting on a dharna near the Rose Garden roundabout, also had to leave and make way for these farmers.

The labourers, who had come from Phillaur after they were threatened and attacked there, were asked by the police to shift, as to avoid staying close to the agitating farmers.

9,"Bansal joins traders’ protest, offers support","CHANDIGARH: The tradersâ€™ rally in protest against the Rent Act notification issued by the UT administration on November 7, 2002, turned political on Monday when Member of Parliament Pawan Kumar Bansal joined the traders.

Traders started their rally at about 9 am and Bansal joined them after about oneand-a-half hour. It was different that he could offer them little except the assurance that he would raise the issue at the meeting of the standing Parliamentary committee attached to the Home Ministry scheduled to be held in the near future.

While talking to mediapersons, Bansal described the issuing of Rent Act notification as misuse of power by the then administrator. He also said,â€˜â€˜The administrator did not use his discretionary power to issue the notification discretely.â€™â€™

The traders are demanding a rollback of the notification or an increase in the limit of Rs 1500 as monthly rent.

Some of the traders also suggested that the notification should be implemented from the date of announcement which was November 7, 2002.

The agreements, however, signed before this date should not come under the purview of the Act.

11,Top cop's car flouts law on flyover,"KOLKATA: After the Malda DIG''s official vehicle, it was the turn of an IG''s official car to break rules on Monday morning. The vehicle, flashing red lights, rode at breakneck speed along the wrong flank of the AJC Bose Road flyover. It was a miracle it did not ram into another car coming from the opposite end.

On Friday, a red-light flashing vehicle broke the one-way rule on Park Street. Police commissioner Sujay Chakraborty happened to spot it and order prosecution of the car, belonging to DIG Gaurav Dutt.

On Monday morning, police claimed they were not sure which senior officer was in the car, but a constable on duty had jotted down its number (3291). They said they were trying to track down the vehicle bearing a two-star insignia. ""The offending vehicle will be prosecuted,"" DC (traffic) M.K. Singh said.

The constable who reported the matter told his superiors that the vehicle took the northern flank to approach the SSKM Hospital end instead of the southern flank. Then again it took a wrong turn towards Hospital Road, ostensibly heading towards Bhavani Bhavan.

Whether the cops actually book this vehicle is yet to be seen, but at least in the other case they are sending a ''citation letter'' or summons to Dutt. The DIG is being told that his driver had broken rules.

Dutt would be told that his driver could not produce the necessary papers when asked. He is also being intimated that the driver is being fined and cautioned against such acts in future, which might attract harsher penalties.

Singh rebuffed suggestions that police soft-pedal prosecution against top cops breaking traffic laws. ""That we are prosecuting in such cases proves otherwise,"" he said.

12,Mayawati may contest LS polls from Akbarpur,"LUCKNOW: Former chief minister Mayawati is planning to contest the Parliamentary polls from Akbarpur. This possibility was discussed by the party leaders who came out of her residence here after attending a dinner-meeting on Monday evening.

Prior to becoming chief minister Mayawati, had represented Akbarpur in the Lok Sabha. At present, the seat is held by Tribhuvan Dutt of BSP. Dutt had won from Akbarpur in a by-election held after Mayawati quit the seat after to take over as the chief minister.

Sources in the party said that pressure was being mounted on her to contest the seat and lead the party in the Lok Sabha. If the former chief minister agreed to the requests of her party colleagues, the siting MP would quit the seat, said the sources.

At present, Rashid Alvi is the leader of the BSP Parliamentary party. In her attempt to win back the dissident MLAs, the former chief minister tried to put up a brave face in the light of CBI''s interrogation questioning her on the Taj heritage controversy. She blamed the officials for the ongoing controversy.

Mayawati was also trying to gauge the mood of her party colleagues in the light of attack on her from various quarters. She said the MLAs who have landed up in the opposition camp might come back if proper attempts were made to bring them back.

13,This college is ahead of govt,"BANGALORE: The Karnataka government recently launched the mid-day meals scheme with great fanfare. But for a private college in Doddaballapur, the Kongadiyappa College, it was nothing new. The college had introduced the scheme long before the government could even think about it.

Conceived by principal B.R. Srinivasa to improve academic performance, the scheme has ensured good attendance among students. And, it has improved their academic performance too. â€œStudents availing of the benefit have to strictly meet some conditions,â€™â€™ says Srinivasa. These are: A minimum attendance; students should have scored certain percentage of marks in the previous exam; studentsâ€™ house must be located at least 15 km from the college.

However, the third condition is not a must. If a student fails to meet these norms, the principal studies the reason and deputes a teacher to visit the studentâ€™s house to find out why he or she was absenting from college. Some 280 students avail of the benefit. Very often, poverty is the reason for students giving hunger top priority and not education. With many students having to travel far to reach their college, they have to start early. â€œI have to start at 5.30 in the morning,â€™â€™ said a commerce student. He has to travel 50 km to attend the 9.30 a.m. class.

The realisation that many students stay hungry during college hours as they cannot bring food from home made the college introduce the programme. â€œThe domestic condition of some students leaves us in tears,â€™â€™ says a teacher Savitri Devi. How are these mid-day meals financed? The principal being â€œmarried to the collegeâ€™â€™, sometimes spends over 50 per cent of his salary on it, says Dr M.V.R. Chetty, a chemistry teacher. The college also seeks donations from some of the better off people in the taluk. Some industries in the neighbourhood, mostly silk, do their bit. Some help in kind, giving rice or other necessary materials.

Amarinder Singh has promised to complete investigation in cases against Badal by November this year and said that ""evidence"" would be presented before the court of law.

17,Partial bandh in parts of Ahmedabad,"AHMEDABAD: A partial bandh was observed in Dariapur and Shahpur areas on Tuesday to protest against alleged random detentions by the police and also the arrests of two clerics in the Akshardham attack case.

Police oficials said though there was no trouble from these sensitive localities, strict vigil was being maintained.

On August 25, a large number of womenfolk residing in Dariapur had blocked the Limdi Chowk over the detentions. The demonstrators had alleged that 128 persons from Dariapur, Kalupur and Shahpur were being illegally detained by the crime branch.

""There is no formal arrest being made and neither are any charges being framed. The crime branch is using this tactic to terrorise the minority community,"" said a local resident who did not wish to be quoted.

18,Ganesha goes political in Gujarat,"VADODARA/AHMEDABAD: It''s nothing short of a pilgrimmage tour for people of Vadodara who seemed to have vowed to take the blessings of Lord Ganesha installed at every pandal this festival. But what is hard to miss is Narendra Modi sharing the limelight with Lord Ganesha in major pandals in the city.

If Modi makes a guest appearance in a wedding sequence in one of the pandals, he is sharing the dais with Prime Minister Vajpayee, even as both watch Lord Ganesha ""punish"" Pakistani president Pervez Musharraf. At another traffic island, Lord Ganesha descends to give ""darshan"" to Modi amidst chanting of Ganesha Stotra.

You name it and they have them all -- adorning the colourful, decorated pandals are political leaders and monuments like Akshardham. If mythological and philosophical themes are a rage, politics seems to be carving its niche in festivities too.

At Bajawada Chakaniya Pol, there is a pandal housing a gigantic idol of Lord Ganesha flanked by Modi and Vajpayee on either side. Ganesha is depicted holding Pervez Musharraf by his neck. A khaki clad Vajpayee and a saffron clad Modi are already drawing huge crowds, while banners which read ""Aathankvadiyon ka sardar Musharraf ka naash karenge Shree Ganesh"" (Leader of the terrorists, Musharraf, will be destroyed by Lord Ganesh) give a political ambience to the pandal.

At a traffic junction overlooking Sursagar, Ganesha descending to Earth has been a major attraction, which is also leading to chaos and traffic jam. Even as the traffic police helplessly try to clear the bulging crowd, Lord Ganesha appears before Modi ""chanting"" Ganesha Stotra.

Surprisingly, a few pandals have a backdrop of Akshardham. The speciality of this pandal at Bagikhana which houses a giant replica of Akshardham is that, artists from Mumbai were specially invited to make them.

The list of political figures includes Sonia, Vajpayee and Modi, who are shown as part of a ""baraat"" (wedding party). If Lord Ganesha is perceived as an omnipresent god, with depiction of ""Ashta Vinayak"", he is also personified as other gods -- Shreeji and Lord Shiva. At a majority of pandals, the backdrop has a narration of mythological stories.

Even amidst the political flavour and religious fervour, you cannot miss the ones which have a message of communal harmony. Limdifalkia Mitra Mandali on Kalupur road has depicted Ganesha as Shirdi Sai Baba -- with messages like ""Sabka Malik Ek hai"".

In Ahmedabad, sculptors say they had received orders to do sculptures of politicians, but could not take up the orders fearing police harassment. ""We had thought about doing a tableau with a political theme. However, post riots, the police have prohibited us from working on displays that could inflame passions and threatened us with dire consequences. So none of us have been able work on these themes,"" said a Moreshwar Pitade, a sculptor.

The Bhadra Yuvak Mandal, meanwhile, have opted for a theme espousing communal harmony. ""We got the Ganesh image specially built by a sculptor in Vadodara with lord Ganesh symbolising religious affinity,"" president of the Mandal Pravin Jagtap said.

19,Punjab police complaint policy slammed,"LUDHIANA: In a bid to improve quality investigative policing and avoid duplicity, DGP, Punjab, A A Sidiqqui has done away with crime, internal vigilance, and litigation investigations and has streamlined complaints into one Grievance cell in the DGP''s office. However, some residents feel they have nowhere else to now in case of an unsatisfactory inquiry by the local police.

For some, the policy change has also led to complete powers being conferred on to the local city police, which could prove harmful in many cases. Ruby Sunda, a widow, who had registered a property dispute case with the local police, had complained of inaction, and had eventually presented her case with the crime branch at Chandigarh, where a re-inquiry was marked a couple of months ago. All the same, she now laments that due to this new policy change, her inquiry was not being dealt seriously.

Another complainant, Parkash Bhatia (name changed), who alleges he was falsely implicated in a swindling case, returned from Chandigarh Crime branch last week, where he was told that he needed DGP''s signatures for initiating an enquiry.

A social worker, Sonia Dhillon, who helps police victims gain respite in Ludhiana, explains that victims seek Crime or Vigilance branch''s help when they are not satisfied with the local police''s inquiry. ""Moreover,"" she points out, ""the local police is based here ant tends to have biases towards one or the other party, which at times makes it difficult for them to conduct fair and just enquiries.""

The ADGP, Crime, K K Attri, on the other hand, explained that streamlining all complaints into one grievance cell has helped duplicity to a large extent. He pointed out that people often wrote complaints and sent copies to Vigilance branch, Crime Branch, High Court, PSHRC, DGP''s office, Litigation wing, and the Chief Minister''s office. He said it was often seen that the force wasted large amount of time, effort, and resources sorting out the same case again and again.

He informed that all branches were now redirecting all letters and complaints to the Grievance Cell in DGP''s office. He said a data is being compiled on the computer, which would be complete within six months. ""Fresh complaints would first be matched with the existing ones, which would point out if this complaint was already dealt by any of the departments in the past, and help save the repeat effort in such matters.""

21,Sonia to tour states going to polls,"NEW DELHI: Congress President Sonia Gandhi plans to vigorously tour the country through road and rail in the states having Assembly polls later this year even as the AICC is finalising an agitational programme to expose the ""failures"" of the BJP-led coalition.

Highly placed party sources said Gandhi''s countrywide tour programme would soon be given finishing touches indicating that it would be a major exercise of reaching out to the people in the backdrop of the party''s Shimla conclave and the block presidents meeting here early this year.

The exercise, which would be the first since Gandhi assumed reins of the organisation five years ago, has come in the midst of speculation over advancing of the Lok Sabha elections. The BJP has already launched ""Mission 2004"" for gearing up for the Lok Sabha polls scheduled next year end.

In Shimla, Gandhi had dared the BJP-led coalition to advance the Lok Sabha elections saying the Congress was prepared to face the challenge any time. She had called for coming together of secular forces to defeat the BJP.

22,Chandigarh has highest per capita income: Data,"CHANDIGARH: The state income data tabulated by the UT Directorate of Economics and Statistics has brought out that Chandigarh has the highest per capita income (PCI) in the country at Rs 48,974.

UT administrator O P Verma on Monday released the booklet on state domestic product and per capita income at current and constant prices for the year 2002-03.

The finance secretary informed the administrator that Chandigarh had the highest per capital income at current prices for the year 2001-2002 at Rs 48,974 followed by Pondicherry at Rs 34680, while the all-India figure stood at Rs 17,978.

For Punjab and Haryana, the PCI stands at Rs 25,652 and Rs 24,575, respectively. At constant prices too, Chandigarh retains the top slot with an income of Rs 28, 271 followed by Pondicherry at Rs 18,820, while the all-India figure stood at Rs 10,754.

For Punjab and Haryana, it is Rs 15,255 and Rs 14,075.

The SDP represents the value of goods and services produced in a state or UT and measures the changes in the level of the economic performance. State income determines the PCI and is an index of the standard of living of the people.

Like the previous year, the tertiary sector continues to be the main growth engine of the local economy. UT administration sources said banking, insurance, telecommunication, hospitality industry, real estate and transport were some segments that had added sparkle to the city''s income.

Coming to the secondary sector, housing and manufacturing are areas that have contributed substantially in raising the PCI of Chandigarh this time.

The primary sector, including agriculture, livestock and forestry, has again stifled the city''s economic performance with negative growth. The process of urbanisation has taken its toll of the primary sector.

The economy of Chandigarh is divided into 14 sub-sectors grouped under three major sectors: primary, secondary and tertiary.
