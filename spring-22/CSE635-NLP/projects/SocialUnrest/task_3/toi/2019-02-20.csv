3,Congress plans prolonged bandh in north Bengal,"kolkata: demanding overall development of north bengal, the pradesh congress has decided to launch a prolonged agitation including a continuous bandh if other forms of agitation fail. â€œthough we are not in favour of sudden bandhs, we may have to resort to it. our bandh in north bengal will not be for one day but over a period of time. the pcc president has already included a north bengal agitation in the partyâ€™s political programme,â€� pcc general secretary kumud bhattacharya told the times of india. bhattacharya, spearheading the movement to highlight north bengalâ€™s plight, said that for starters his party would be holding meetings in front of the sdoâ€™s office at siliguri on february 22, demanding development of the regionâ€™s six districts. this would be followed by a joint convention of congress leaders from the six districts at islampur on march 16 to endorse the party programme and mobilise public opinion culminating in the bandh. the pcc has identified a number of issues that has not been addressed. â€œpeople of north bengal feel neglected as the state governmentâ€™s development initiatives remain confined to the south of farakka,â€� said bhattacharya. the result? a spurt of divisive movements like the uttarakhand, gorkhaland and kamtapur. the never-ending teesta project is another issue the congress would highlight. bhattacharya alleged that though the project was conceived in 1976 at a cost of rs 90 crore, not even 25 per cent of the work was complete. the guard-walls and the embankments are falling off even though rs 1,200 crore have been spent. â€œthe teesta project would have enabled multiple cropping in north bengal and changed the face of the region,â€� claimed bhattacharya. other issues the congress would focus on are the cannibalisation of agricultural land by tea gardens, giving rise to a new class of landless in the region. bhattacharya scoffed at the cmâ€™s recent spree of foundation-stone laying ceremonies for industrial units in cooch behar, saying, â€œcooch behar has the worst power situation. industries cannot be set up here without power.â€� the congress would also press for an engineering college having courses in agro-based industries in north bengal.

4,Rival unions clash again on CU campus,"kolkata: violence broke out for the second day in calcutta university campus with cpm-backed sfi activists taking on the congress-backed chhatra parishad members on tuesday. the cp had organised a meeting condemning the violence that started on monday when the sfi members objected to the saraswati puja organised by the chhatra parishad. cp leaders claimed that on tuesday, sfi activists tore their banner and started throwing bricks. one of the students, tapojit roy, was injured in the scuffle and taken to medical college hospital. the sfi, however, said that it was merely opposing the entry of outsiders in the university campus during the puja. cp president subhankar sarkar, however, challenged the sfi to identify the â€œrowdy elementsâ€�. he blamed the latter for the violence over saras-wati puja, which the cp has been organising for the last 37 years. he said that it was the sfiâ€™s â€œpanic reactionâ€� to the erosion of support in colleges all over west bengal. â€œthey are losing out everywhere, so they are resorting to intimidation,â€� sarkar said.

5,Japanese investors await proposals from state govt,"kolkata: the west bengal government is yet to forward a single concrete investment proposal since the re-opening of the overseas development assistance by japan last october. the oda had been suspended since 1998 following the pokhran ii nuclear test. speaking to tnn, consul general of japan ryuzo kikuchi said though he was keen to strengthen economic ties between japan and west bengal and alter the stateâ€™s negative image that persists among japanese, proposals were not forthcoming from the local government. oda has previously okayed two projects in the state â€” bakreshwar stage ii and purulia pump storage. â€œwhile the buddhadeb bhattacharjee government has done much to improve the investment climate in the state, it is difficult for the japanese to understand and appreciate the changes unless they see it themselves. and that can happen only if they fly down to explore opportunities and for this you need to send them definite proposals,â€� he said. despite big-time investments at the mitsubishi chemical corporationâ€™s pta unit in haldia and interest evinced by firms like mitsui, thaisei construction and marubeni, the image of the state among the average japanese investor is still one that was imprinted in the late 1970s and through the â€™80s. â€œwhile ground realities have changed a lot, thereâ€™s still the impression that west bengal is plagued by strikes and unproductive labour,â€� kikuchi said. the consul generalâ€™s personal interest had led to bhattacharjeeâ€™s visit to the country in september 2001. â€œhe impressed many a business and political leaders with his pragmatic approach. the goodwill that was created needs to be taken forward now,â€� kikuchi said. while he is even willing to give a personal recommendation to such projects, the government has been slow in sending them to the japanese consulate. sources though said that a couple of projects are definitely in the pipeline. â€œone project is on the traffic signalling system across the city. the other project is building a bridge that will connect haldia with raichak,â€� the sources said. japanese giant mitsubishi is believed to be pitching for both projects. though kikuchi refused to comment on these projects, he acknowledged that communication across the state needed to be upgraded to draw investments. pointing to the unfinished haldia-kolkata highway project, he said: â€œhow do you expect investments to flow in when a simple promise given to mitsubishi chemicals corporation of building a world class road is not kept. though the government is now showing urgency, but such simple issues have to be dealt with more promptly,â€� he said. kikuchi, however, is not giving up hope. and he is firm on doing his bit. this year, he is pitching for the japanese economic delegationâ€™s visit to kolkata when it comes to india this october. â€œambassador hiroshi hirabayashi too feels that the team needs to visit states where they are scouting for investment opportunities apart from speaking to people in delhi,â€� he said. while the teams have visited chennai, bangalore and hyderabad in their previous visits, kolkata is yet to figure in their itinerary. kikuchu though, hopes to alter that this year. referring to the japanese business community which was currently focused singularly on china, the diplomat said india would have to aggressively attract more investment from the us, germany and the uk to convince them of indiaâ€™s emerging importance. â€œwhile i personally feel that india is a more stable market than china, japanese investors are too shy to venture alone. they will follow where americans and germans tread,â€� he admitted.

7,Greens oppose relaxations in CRZ rules,"mumbai: city environmental groups are writing to the union government to protest its recent proposal to relax the restrictions on construction in coastal areas. the ministry of environment and forest in january issued a draft notification proposing to amend the coastal regulation zone (crz) rules to permit the building of infrastructure and dwellings for local inhabitants. it also sought to allow housing schemes approved by urban development authorities before february 1991, as well as non-polluting and service industries in special economic zones. but local environmental groups, including the bombay natural history society, bombay environmental action group (beag) and the world wide fund for nature, say the amendments will lead to the coastal environment being damaged. for example, while the proposal to ease restrictions on local inhabitants is meant to help indigenous coastal communities, environmentalists say the relaxation could be misused. according to one group, the definition of â€˜local inhabitantâ€™ is so loose that it could be misinterpreted. â€œitâ€™s not clear why they have knocked off â€˜traditional rights of fishermenâ€™ which is very specific,â€™â€™ says debi goenka of beag. the group has suggested that certain safeguards be laid down. these include restricting the relaxation to those who have been living in the area since before 1991; those who were living in an authorised structure as on january 19, 1999, the date of the original crz notification; and those who have their names in the voters list.they have also suggested conditions on the type and size of structures to be built. environmentalists are also upset over the proposal to allow non-polluting and service industries in the crz. â€œin fact, we would urge that the setting up of special economic zones within the crz should be prohibited,â€™â€™ they state in their letter, adding, â€œcertainly such activities such as hotels, golf courses, and non-polluting industries should not be located within 200 metres of the high tide line.â€™â€™ incidentally, the city and industrial development corporation has been asking for such an exemption to develop the proposed special economic zone in navi mumbai. while the notification gives permission to construct roads which were proposed before 1991, environmentalists point out that many of these are on land which has been illegally reclaimed after 1991. â€œthe agencies concerned should be prosecuted for such violations rather than their actions being regularised,â€™â€™ notes beag. it advocates a similar attitude to housing schemes which have been stalled because of crz restrictions, including many of the cityâ€™s housing boardâ€™s schemes. â€œmany of the plots were sold before â€˜91,â€™â€™ acknowledges mr goenka, â€œbut for those which havenâ€™t been,mhada should offer alternatives or refund the buyers with interest.â€™â€™ the groups have also suggested that sand mining be prohibited in the andaman and nicobar islands and that salt harvesting by solar evaporation of sea water be restricted in mangrove and other ecologically sensitive areas. â€œitâ€™s interesting that while the state government wants to convert salt pan lands here for housing, they are asking for exemptions for salt harvesting,â€™â€™ adds mr goenka. the crz rules were brought into effect in january 1999 to protect coastal areas, including bays, estuaries, creeks, rivers and backwaters. it prevents new constructions in the area up to 500 metres on the landward side from the high-tide line, as well the setting up of industries and other operations. since then, the original notification has been amended at least ten times, every time amidst controversies and protests from environmentalists.

8,"I am in the race for chief ministership, says Bhattal","chandigarh: former punjab chief minister rajinder kaur bhattal said on tuesday that she too was in race for the post of chief minister. she said that the party would emerge victorious with a comfortable majority to form the next government. responding to whether she would stake her claim to chief ministership if the congress returned to power, bhattal said it was natural for any politician to nourish an ambition to serve the people in the best possible way. â€˜â€˜but i would submit to the decision of the party high command like a disciplined soldier of the party,"" she said. when asked how many of the tobe mlas would stand in his support, bhattal said. â€˜â€˜they won''t be rajinder''s or amarinder''s men. they would be only congressmen and would follow the directions of the party high command with regard to election of the leader of the legislative party."" commenting on the speculations in certain quarters on the probability of ambika soni emerging as the consensus candidate, bhattal said that soni had confided that she was not inclined to enter state politics. â€˜â€˜however, if the party high command decides in her favour, we would welcome her and extend all co-operation,"" she added. evidently, for bhattal, the issue of leadership of legislative party is still wide open even though senior party functionary natwar singh had clearly suggested that conventionally amarinder singh, being the chief of the state unit, was tipped to the top slot. â€˜â€˜natwar singh is neither the general secretary, punjab affairs nor authorised to take decisions on behalf of the party high command. it is his personal opinion,"" she said.

9,Loans used to improve economy: Finance minister,"hyderabad: defending the loans obtained from the world bank, the state government has categorically said that there were no conditionalities involved in securing the world bank loans even as the congress alleged that the alarming fiscal situation warranted imposition of financial emergency in the state. replying to a more than onehour debate on the issue during question hour in the legislative assembly on tuesday, finance minister y ramakrishnudu said that the funds mobilised through borrowings had been utilised on capital expenditure for creating assets to improve the living standards of the people and bring the shattered economy back on the rails. while agreeing that total debt, including that owed to external agencies, the central government and open market had crossed rs 40,000 crore so far, ramakrishnudu, however, said that the loans obtained from the world bank were only to the tune of rs 7,260 crore and the amounts had been tied up with for implementation of 25 schemes, including andhra pradesh hazard mitigation project and power sector reforms. it was due to the effective utilisation of funds by the tdp government, the growth rate started improving in the state after dropping steeply during the previous congress regime. the current growth rate stood at 5.2 per cent while it dropped from 6.2 per cent to 4.9 per cent during the congress time. ""we are ready to prove as to how the congress misused more than rs 7,000 crore it obtained from the bank which resulted in dropping the growth rate from 6.2 per cent to 4.9 per cent,"" he said. on the opposition criticism about mounting debts, he said that the financial situation was never hidden from the people and they were even projected in the annual fiscal framework document released by the government recently. earlier, raising the issue, opposition leader y s rajasekhara reddy said that revenue deficit had touched a staggering rs 15,600 crore accounting for 14 per cent of the gross state domestic product (gsdp). he alleged that the government was resorting to indiscriminate borrowings and much of the external funds were going towards debt servicing.

11,NCP leaves the rest behind in ZP polls,"mumbai: the nationalist congress party (ncp) surged ahead of the congress, its main rival, to emerge as the single largest party in all the regions in the state, except vidarbha, in the zilla parishad (zp) elections. deputy chief minister chhagan bhujbal said, â€œthe ncp has received overwhelming support in all the regions in the state. now that the zp elections are over, there will be no problem in the smooth functioning of the democratic front government.â€™â€™ referring to the dismal performance of the party in the just-concluded civic elections, he said,â€œwe have a solid rural base.we never had much presence in cities which are traditionally controlled by urban-based saffron parties.â€™â€™ meanwhile, maharashtra pradesh congress committee chief govindrao adik, who spearheaded the partyâ€™s campaign, expressed satisfaction with the outcome of the zp elections. he hinted at the possibility of the party seeking the ncpâ€™s cooperation to ensure that the shiv sena-bjp alliance was unable to capture the zilla parishads where neither the congress nor the ncp had secured a majority. state bjp general secretary sharad kulkarni said the fact that the saffron alliance had won 10 zps as against four the last time had indicated that the mass base of the saffron alliance was expanding fast in the rural parts of the state. speaking about the likely impact of the results on the df government, he said, â€œthe overall situation will be reviewed in a day or two by consulting senior leaders of both the parties.â€™â€™ at the time of going to press, results had been declared in 1,530 of the 1,641 zp seats.while the ncp bagged 437, congress won 373, shiv sena 302, bjp 212, local fronts 125 and independents 63. in the panchayat samiti polls, results have been declared in 2,886 of the 3,262 samitis, with ncp winning 812, congress 680, shiv sena 574, bjp 386, local fronts 284, independents 127, cpm 21, janata dal (secular) 9, cpi 2, rjd 1 bahujan mahasangh 11, bahujan samaj party 5 and the rpi (gavai) 7. the shiv sena has bagged the sindhudurg and ratnagiri zps while ncp minister sunil tatkare has succeeded in upsetting the pwp in raigad district. in nashik and jalgaon, the saffron alliance has emerged on top. the ncp does not seem to have benefited much from former sena leader suresh jain joining the party as the bjp emerged as the single largest party in jalgaon. in nagpur and chandrapur, the congress and the ncp will enjoy the majority if they join hands, but the saffron alliance has increased its share of seats.while the ncp has emerged as the single largest party in ahmednagar and satara district, the congress has performed well in kolhapur. in marathwada, where clashes took place during the counting, the ncp has bagged beed district, while the congress has maintained its lead in hingoli and other neighbouring districts.

12,"Violence, bogus voting not ruled out in Rajkot-2","rajkot: it is a ''mother of all battles'' that the congress and bjp are gearing up for in rajkot-2 with the bitter contest poised to decide the fate of narendra modi''s continuation as chief minister. the high-decibel campaign, which brought out the worst in politicians, came to an end on tuesday. it is still leaves open the possibility of poll-related violence in one of the quietest regions of the country. what has heightened fears that this is not going to be a tame affair is the fact that entire armies of party workers, both of the bjp and congress, have descended on the city from neighbouring districts of saurashtra and as far afield as ahmedabad and mehsana. with the atmosphere already vitiated by a string of congress-sponsored pamphlets taking persoanl potshots at modi and the administration clamping down on the mud-slinging through an official notification, it is doubtful whether the election commission''s advice to both parties to observe restraint will be heeded. while nobody gave the congress a chance when the campaign kicked off late last month, an impressive rally brought out by the party in favour of its candidate ashwin mehta on tuesday has given reason, at least to party workers, to believe that the contest may be more evenly poised than hitherto thought. and it is not just the embittering of relations between the bjp and congress that this contest will be remembered for, whichever side wins. the administration, controlled by the bjp, is also drawing flak from an aggressive opposition, and officials perceived as being close to the establishment are being singled out for criticism. signs of the growing tension between the two sides were evident on tuesday when the congress rally passed by the bjp office. congressmen threw the controversial pamphlets at bjp workers creating a tense situation. the bjp workers retaliated by immediately making a bonfire of the printed missiles. when a confrontation seeemed imminent, congress leader vithal radadia reached the spot and defused the tension. bogus voting is a distinct possibility as the size of the electorate - 1.5 lakh - is small and better man-management on polling day can tilt the final outcome. says former chief minister and senior congress leader shankersinh vaghela, who is sphearheading the congress fight, ""every effort will be made to ensure that the bjp does not succeed in bogus voting."" he added that a booth-wise voters list is ready with the congress. besides, a door-to-door survey has been done to determine which voters are out of town. ""even the list of voters who are dead is ready,"" vaghela says. on the other hand, bjp leader vijay rupani said their yuva morcha volunteers would also man booths. besides, a ''flying squad'' would also be set up and led by bjp leaders like jitu mehta, former mayor uday kangad and rajbha zala to check impersonation and bogus voting. officials said that the possibility of a minor incident sparking off violence could not be ruled out in this eyeball-to-eyeball situation. police bandobast on a scale never witnessed in gujarat in any previous election had been made. police commissioner upendra singh said two battalions of the rapid action force, three of the state reserve police force, besides as many as 1,200 policemen from other cities would be deployed in the city. according to singh, 60 police sub-inspectors, 30 police inspectors and four officers of the rank of deputy superintendent would work in tandem with the local police. the force from outside would be aided by a 1,000-strong local police team, he said. the police have also started checking vehicles coming into rajkot as there are chances that these may carry arms and ammunition and even inflammatory leaflets.

""we had rushed to the hospital as the victims belong to the waghodia constituency. i reached there and saw a group of doctors laughing and talking on the telephone. there were patients lying unattended. when i told them to attend to the patients, they verbally abused me instead. that is when my husband intervened. but he has not physically abused anyone in the hospital. it is doctors who have been rude,"" she said. ssg superintendent kamal pathak instituted a five-member committee to inquire into the allegations and has asked them to submit their report within 48 hours. according to him, such incidents where doctors were verbally and physically abused have occurred in the past too. ""we have therefore asked the police commissioner to ensure that our doctors at the casualty ward have adequate protection during such crisis,"" he said. the accident occurred on monday night near sikandarpur naka after the driver of a truck lost control. a marriage party was travelling in the truck.

17,Development is the main issue,"rae bareli: cross-border terrorism, poto and simi are not the main issues in all the seven assembly segments of the district which go to the elections on february 21. in fact, the election here is fought on the development issue. the old-timers still recall with nostalgia their association with the late prime minister indira gandhi who was elected to the lok sabha thrice from the constituency. the people recall how indiraji once presided over a vikas gosthi here to dispose of their complaints. even now the people want development and they have high expectations from their elected representatives. rajiv lochan pandey, a resident of sultanpur-aima, part of the rae bareli assembly constituency, said people wanted only two things from mlas. first they should be available to them and secondly they should attend to their problems. asked whether present mla akhilesh kumar singh, who is seeking election for the third-term as congress nominee from the rae bareli assembly constituency, fulfilled the two expectations, pandey replied in the affirmative. according to him, 70 per cent of the voters of his village are going to vote for the congress. a visit to a few villages around the city revealed that akhilesh is more popular among the rural folks as a good samaritan than as a man with a criminal background. pandey said that akhilesh not only got two handpumps installed in his village but also ensured that a road was laid from kalsaha to nathaipur via khanwa. besides, the mla provided economic help to people for the marriage of their daughters, he said. suresh kumar yadav of tiwari-ka-purwa, a hamlet of belagusisi village, said akhilesh came to the rescue of the village folks when an epidemic broke out there. he provided financial help to about half-a-dozen families enabling them to arrange proper medical care for their kith and kin, he revealed. expressing similar views, rajesh kumar maurya of ibrahimpur village said the villagers were grateful to akhilesh for providing basic amenities to them. he also supported people when they were in distress. however, the president of the central bar association ashok kumar bhargava strikes an altogether pessimistic note. elaborating his views, he said: â€œthere will be no improvement unless and until criminals are thrown out of politics.â€� all political parties had fielded criminals in the current elections, he said. kenwal singh of raipur, part of the sataon constituency, said that the voter wanted development which was taken up vigorously only in the congress regime. nawab ali of tiwari khera said that the muslims would vote for the congress as they wanted a change. he is bitter about the bjp government. â€œi have to pay irrigation charges even when the canal of the area is not functional,â€� he said. all these voters favour the congress nominee indresh vikram singh as he has a clean image.

18,Congress plans prolonged bandh in north Bengal,"kolkata: demanding overall development of north bengal, the pradesh congress has decided to launch a prolonged agitation including a continuous bandh if other forms of agitation fail. â€œthough we are not in favour of sudden bandhs, we may have to resort to it. our bandh in north bengal will not be for one day but over a period of time. the pcc president has already included a north bengal agitation in the partyâ€™s political programme,â€� pcc general secretary kumud bhattacharya told the times of india. bhattacharya, spearheading the movement to highlight north bengalâ€™s plight, said that for starters his party would be holding meetings in front of the sdoâ€™s office at siliguri on february 22, demanding development of the regionâ€™s six districts. this would be followed by a joint convention of congress leaders from the six districts at islampur on march 16 to endorse the party programme and mobilise public opinion culminating in the bandh. the pcc has identified a number of issues that has not been addressed. â€œpeople of north bengal feel neglected as the state governmentâ€™s development initiatives remain confined to the south of farakka,â€� said bhattacharya. the result? a spurt of divisive movements like the uttarakhand, gorkhaland and kamtapur. the never-ending teesta project is another issue the congress would highlight. bhattacharya alleged that though the project was conceived in 1976 at a cost of rs 90 crore, not even 25 per cent of the work was complete. the guard-walls and the embankments are falling off even though rs 1,200 crore have been spent. â€œthe teesta project would have enabled multiple cropping in north bengal and changed the face of the region,â€� claimed bhattacharya. other issues the congress would focus on are the cannibalisation of agricultural land by tea gardens, giving rise to a new class of landless in the region. bhattacharya scoffed at the cmâ€™s recent spree of foundation-stone laying ceremonies for industrial units in cooch behar, saying, â€œcooch behar has the worst power situation. industries cannot be set up here without power.â€� the congress would also press for an engineering college having courses in agro-based industries in north bengal.

23,M&M's restructuring a positive development: Crisil,"mumbai: crisil said on wednesday the proposed restructuring in mahindra & mahindra (m&m), entailing amalgamation of three of its subsidiaries into itself with effect from march 31, 2002, ""is a positive development"", although the ratings of m&m''s debt instruments will remain unaltered as a result of this move. m&m''s rs 1,020 crore non-convertible debenture issue has been assigned ''aa'' rating, indicating high safety, while the rs 100 crore commercial paper programme has a ''p1+'' rating, crisil said in release here on wednesday. mahindra auto specialities, e-mahindra solutions and mahindra alternative technologies are proposed to be merged with m&m. in crisil''s opinion, increased transparency regarding the valuation of m&m''s numerous investments that would ensue following these amalgamations was a welcome feature. further, the surplus arising from restatement of value of investments held by the amalgamated companies would be transferred to an ""investment fluctuation reserve."" diminution in the value of any other investments carried in m&m''s books would be adjusted against this reserve. the surplus arises mainly on account of large retained earnings of mahindra british telecom, it said. these surpluses had already been factored in the analysis and hence the ratings on m&m''s debt instruments remain unchanged, crisil added. based on the audited financials as on march 31, 2001, this surplus was estimated to be around rs 72.6 crore as on that date. (in addition to this amount, the actual surplus that would be amalgamated on march 2002 would incorporate the earnings of these subsidiaries for the year 2001-02.) these amalgamations were in line with m&m''s longer-term objective of de-layering the ownership structure of various group businesses, it said. further, it would also result in a more tax efficient ownership structure of these businesses, as any outflows on account of dividend tax would be eliminated, crisil said.

strongly critical of the exit poll and pre-poll predictions about punjab, dhindsa described them as ""false, baseless, unscientific and politically motivated"".

dhindsa expressed dissatisfaction over the manner in which the ""very important issue"" of poll predictions is being dealt with by the commission, which on the other hand does not hesitate from issuing orders in a simple case of transfer of an sho of a police station.
