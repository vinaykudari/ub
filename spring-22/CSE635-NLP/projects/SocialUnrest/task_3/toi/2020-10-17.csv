0,Skewed credit policy cause of farmers' suicides: Moily,"MANGALORE: Veerappa Moily, chairman, Revenue Reforms Commission, on Friday observed that the skewed credit policy on agriculture was solely responsible for the farmers'' suicide in the state, as well as in the country.

Speaking at the valedictory function of the Fifth State Level Conference of Commerce and Management Teachers, Moily noted that liberalisation is a must, but `liberal humanism'' should also go along with it to cushion the immediate effects of such liberalised economy, he said.

Moily also lashed at the banking system in the country, saying the industry operated uneconomically and the rural credit lending was dismal.

Pointing out at neighbouring China,he said the country had achieved 10 per cent GDPin eight years time, while the developed countries had taken double the time to achieve such high GDP growth. Moily asserted that such growth could also be replicated in India by 2015, provided there was will power and the business spirit to go along with. As a case in point, he cited the example of electronic city in Anekal Taluk which generated exports worth Rs 22,000 crore per annum.

Pointing at the high tax evasion, he said as much as 60 per cent of the population evaded taxes, was by itself a pointer to the sad state of affairs.

Moily said he would be submitting the final reports on education, health, irrigation and forest to the state by October 21. On this occasion, the Federation of Teachers'' Councils of Commerce and Management in Karnataka and Mangalore University Commerce Teachers'' Association (Mucta), passed five resolutions one of which was demand to the state to introduce commerce management education curriculum at the higher secondary level.

The others are: every university should have student research and development facility and synergy between industry and university; amendment to rules of admission to BEd so that BCom and BBM students can seek admissions to BEd; give importance to commerce management students in banking and insurance sector during recruitment and formation of Commerce and Management Council on the lines of AICTE, Medical and Dental councils.

1,"VHP meet foiled, Singhal arrested","AYODHYA: VHP leader Ashok Singhal was arrested in Ayodhya on Friday as the police foiled plans to hold a â€˜Sankalp Sammelanâ€™ near the disputed structure.

However, the VHP did manage to hold a symbolic programme later in the day at Karsewakpuram (its central office in Ayodhya) when Singhal was released. Through the day, about 5,000 VHP activists were arrested.

There was sporadic violence, lathi-charge and teargassing in various parts of the town. Former BJP MP Ram Vilas Vedanti was arrested from Nayaghat, along with 30 activists when they tried to hold the ceremony on the banks of the Saryu. BJP chief Vinay Katiyar was reluctant to criticise the Mulayam Singh government, lending weight to the belief that the BJP leadership may have struck an understanding with the chief minister.

The day started with thousands of VHP activists disembarking at Ayodhya railway station, while some sneaked into the city from adjoining districts. Most activists at the station were arrested while others went on to Karsewakpuram.

There were pitched battles between the police and the activists, with the activists pelting stones. However, district officials said, Singhal was too busy talking to reporters there to calm the crowd of activists.

2,Brakes put on Euro-II option for old trucks,"MUMBAI: Rejecting the pleas of 20,000 heavy-vehicle owners, the Bombay high court on Friday refused to relax earlier directives on old heavy vehicles, which specify that they should be either phased out or have their engines converted to lesser-polluting fuels like Compressed Natural Gas (CNG).

The court instead extended the pollution orders to include old heavy vehicles registered outside Mumbai.

Such vehicles â€”trucks, tempos and buses that are at least 15 years oldâ€” will now not be allowed to ply in the city unless their engines are converted to CNG or liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).

Specifically, the court declined to allow transporters the option of retrofitting old vehicles with Euro-II engines, saying there was not enough evidence to show that this was feasible or would reduce pollution.

A division bench of chief justice C.K. Thakker and D.Y. Chandrachud noted Telcoâ€™s statement that it could not give any warranty on retrofitted vehicles.

Vehicle owners had been pushing for retrofitted Euro-II engines, which comply with stricter environmental norms, as a viable option to replacing vehicles entirely.

Owners argued that since converting engines to CNG or LPG, as directed by the court earlier, was not technically possible, they should be allowed the Euro-II alternative, which would serve the same purpose of reducing vehicular emissions.

Owners pointed out that a new heavy goods vehicle that conformed to Euro-II standards would range from Rs 6 lakhs to Rs 10 lakhs.

The deadlines for phasing out old vehicles were set as part of a series of orders issued by the Bombay high court following a public interest litigation on vehicular pollution. Older vehicles are considered to be more polluting.

When the transporters challenged these orders earlier this year in the supreme court, the apex court turned down their plea, but said they could take up the retrofitting issue with the high court by supplying substantial evidence on its advantages.

7,Water-cuts policy gets conditional nod,"PUNE: While permitting civic officials to formulate a policy on water-cuts in the city on Friday, corporators emphasised that the ""cuts"" would be applicable only this year and that the water thus saved would be diverted to droughthit parts of the district.

â€œWater cuts cannot be made a permanent feature in Pune. Also, we will also not allow ministers to divert the cityâ€™s water supply to sugarcane farms in their constituencies,â€� warned BJP and Shiv Sena leaders at the Pune Municipal Corporationâ€™s (PMC) general body meeting.

Earlier, additional municipal commissioner D.S. Zagade drew the attention of the House to a letter from the state irrigation department, asking the PMC to supply just 135 litres of water per person per day, instead of the present average of 200 litres.

Zagade said the irrigation officials and several state ministers had appealed to the PMC to reduce the supply per person in view of the drought-like conditions across the state. â€œWe must respond to this appeal,â€� he said, announcing a 15-day limit for formulating the water-cuts policy.

While assuring corporators that no cuts would be applied in area without the consent of respective corporators, Zagade explained the water conservation plan. â€œRepairs of leaking pipelines, completion of pending projects, reduction of 24-hour water supply in certain parts (especially slums) to an eighthour supply are some of the measures,â€� he said.

8,2 students commit suicide,"HYDERABAD: Two students committed suicide in the city since Thursday evening, bringing the total number of students who killed themselves in the past ten days alone to six.

While N Siva Kumar, a 21-year-old undergraduate student from Malakpet, committed suicide on Friday evening, Ch Chandrasekhar, a 16-year-old class 10 student from Kalasiguda, committed suicide on Thursday evening.

Malakpet police said Siva Kumar, a student of Badruka College, left a suicide note saying he was vexed with life and that nobody was responsible for his death. His father Rakesh Kumar is an employee of the Government Ayurvedic Hospital.

However, the case of Chandrasekhar was different. The boy was the adopted son of Bhaskar, a petty trader.

According to Mahankali police, the boy hanged himself when his mother had gone to the vegetable market and his father was at his cloth shop.

Bhaskar came home on Thursday at around 7 pm and found all the lights in the house switched off and the front door open.

He called out for his wife, but there was no response. He then switched on the lights and entered the bedroom where Bhaskar found his son hanging. He immediately rushed the boy to a nearby hospital with the help of neighbours, where he was declared brought dead.

Police said that Bhaskar reprimanded the boy on Thursday morning for skipping school and also for scoring low marks in the quarterly exams held recently. The boy was deeply hurt by the reprimand and this could have led him to take the extreme step, police sources said.

It may be recalled a physicallychallenged student, A Rammohan Reddy, 24, committed suicide by consuming poison on Wednesday, while an engineering student Ch Prashant Kumar, 19, jumped from the fourth floor of his college building to death. Prashanth allegedly committed suicide as he was unable to bear harassment by some lecturers.

On October 7, a class seven student O Lavanya of Chatrinaka and P Suresh, 15, an eighth class student committed suicide by setting themselves ablaze after their parents reprimanded them.

9,Buddha scoffs at sympathy politics,"KOLKATA: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has been unusually hostile after the death of six-month-old Shabana Parvin of Howrah.

After rebuking the media on Thursday for highlighting the travails of the bereaved family, the chief minister called himself a â€œpolitician of a different breedâ€� on Friday.

Bhattacharjee was visibly upset as the media reported his hostile comments, undermining his image as a sensitive chief minister.

After all, this was the man who had reached out to the distressed, even travelling on a van rickshaw before the Assembly polls.

â€œWe do not run after votes. I did not enter politics for electoral ambitions. We are politicians of a different breed. I always stood for humane values,â€� maintained Bhattacharjee. â€œWho am I? Take me as I am,â€� he said, posing the existentialist question to the scribes.

â€œI did visit Howrah after a cholera outbreak, the B.C. Roy hospital and Murshidabad after reports of child deaths. These were all after the polls. I will give you the dates,â€� he added.

For the record, Bhattacharjee visited the B.C. Roy hospital after his health minister Surjya Kanta Mishraâ€™s indifference towards child deaths had been reported in the media.

He visited Murshidabad after the Congress called a bandh over the child deaths The panchayat polls were round the corner. He did not visit Dhantala in Nadia, where minor girls were raped.

10,VHP raises strong protest against Govt,"LUCKNOW: The state capital of Lucknow on Friday saw some strong protests from VHP activists for being held back from proceeding towards Ayodhya.

Over 150 VHP activists hailing from Gujarat, Maharashtra and Karnataka who were arrested in the state capital while on way to Ayodhya, torched the effigy of chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav soon after being set free from the Lucknow district jail where they were confined after being rounded up. Protesting just outside the gates of the jail compound, the activists pledged to ensure all out support for temple construction in Ayodhya.

In Daliganj area, former BJP MLA Ram Kumar Shukla made an abortive bid to obstruct rail traffic while VHP leader Ved Prakash Sachan managed to block a goods train at Alamnagar before being arrested with their supporters. In Kalyanpur, former BJP MLA Gomti Yadav and his supporters courted arrest.

In Kanpur, BJP MP from Bilhaur, Shyam Behari Misra and others suffered injuries when VHP supporters detained at Mandi Samiti temporary jail forced open the gates and hurled stones at the heavy police posse while trying to force their way through the security cordon and march towards Ayodhya. SSP Ramendra Vikram Singh was injured in the stone-pelting. Thereafter, all the arrested leaders were brought to the police lines.

In Allahabad, VHP activists led by local VHP leader Keshav Prasad were rounded up by police while trying to take out a procession through the communally hyper sensitive Chowk area. In Varanasi, though the VHP call for bandh evoked a poor response, a handful of activists took out processions from different parts of the temple town and marched to the railway station to proceed to Ayodhya.

11,Shifting of J&K CM house ruled out,"SRINAGAR: Director General of Jammu and Kashmir Police Gopal Sharma ruled out suggestion of shifting of the official residence of the chief minister, in view of the fidayeen attack on the CM''s residence on Friday.

The 24-hour long gun battle between holed-up militants and the security forces, finally ended on Saturday morning.

Talking to the reporters at the site of encounter, Sharma said that the CM''s residence should be centrally located, inorder to provide people access to meet the chief minister. He added: ""It is the duty of the police to provide security to the chief minister.""

The DG said that the operation was clean as it did not cause any collateral damage either to the property or to the life of the civilians. He said the operation would have ended on Friday, but was restricted because the civilians where holed up in the shopping complex after the militants took refuge in the complex.

About 25 civilians were evacuated from the shopping complex before final assault on the militants was launched early in the morning on Saturday, Director General Police said.

The upscale shopping complex houses many shops including a Tanishq outlet with jewellery watches and ornaments worth millions of rupees. A number of computer hardware shops and Internet cafes besides furnishing business houses are also located in the building.

The standoff between militants and security forces, which began on Friday morning at a shopping complex near the Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister''s residence, ended with the killing of two suicidal Pakistani militants.

According to reports, one militant has been killed as firing resumed following a lull during the night. The militant, yet to be identified, was shot dead, when he tried to escape at around 8 am on Saturday morning. While the other militant, who was injured in the exchange of fire, was holed-up in cloakroom of the shopping complex.

The injured militant was killed later.

The slain militants were identified as Abu Mawood and Abu Junaid of Lashkar-e-Taiba militant outfit and were Pakistani nationals. The dead bodies of the two militants were later shifted to police control room in Srinagar.

The vehicular traffic and the public movement on Maulana Azad Road is still restricted as live hand grenade has been sighted by the security forces.

BSF spokesman said that the BSF personnel recovered two AK rifle and one pistol from the encounter site.

Meanwhile, National Conference President Omar Abdullah while condemning the attack on CM''s residence said that the ''unfortunate'' incident is an outcome of the ''political gimmick'' of the CM to play to the gallery, by staying in the heart of the city and thus jeopardising the security of hundreds of people.

The Incident, he said, vindicates former CM Farooq''s stand to build CM''s residence in a secluded and secure place so as not to put to risk the lives of common citizens.

Senior Congress leader and former MP Ghulam Rasool Kar also condemned the attack and said that such attacks would hamper the peace efforts between India and Pakistan.

14,BJP rejects VHP's demand to dismiss Mulayam govt,"NEW DELHI: Heaving a sigh of relief over the manner in which the government handled the Ayodhya situation, the BJP on Saturday rejected VHP''s demand for the dismissal of Mulayam Singh government and Congress demand for a ban on the VHP.

""Since no major untoward incident had taken place, there is no rationale for either the dismissal of the UP government or ban on the VHP"", BJP President M Venkaiah Naidu said addressing the National Executive meeting of the BJP Doctors'' Cell.

""Congress wants banning of VHP and not the Muslim League or SIMI. There may be difference of opinion with VHP. But what is the message that it (Congress) is wanting to give'', he asked.

Brushing aside Congress accusation of ""double standards"" by BJP on the Ram Temple issue, he said ""our stand is very clear. We want a magnificent temple for Ram at his birth place. Let everybody understand this, but we would like it to happen in a proper, dignified and peaceful manner"".

Ayodhya and Ram temple was a matter of deep reverence and faith for the Hindus and it was a national issue that involved the faith and belief of millions of Indians, Naidu said adding ""it cannot and should not be wished away or ignored"".

Accusing the ''pseudo-secular'' parties of placing hurdles in the process, he said that the Muslim community must rise to the occasion and display a strong sense of brotherhood by respecting the sentiments of the majority community.

""The Ram Temple at Ayodhya cannot be equated to a structure built by an invader"", Naidu said and appealed to Muslims to come forward and show positive approach to resolve the issue once for all and not to be misled by pseudo secularists.

""It is not Muslims or their organisations which are responsible for complicating this dispute, but it is pseudo secularists and their vote bank politics"", he said.

Recalling that shilanyas was performed during Congress tenure and former Prime Minister P V Narasimha Rao had promised reconstruction of the masjid at the site, Naidu said Congress should make its stand clear on these issues.

Launching a frontal attack on Congress for all the ills that the country had been facing for nearly five decades, Naidu said while the BJP-led NDA government was successfully running a coalition for five years, Congress remained silent despite its president Sonia Gandhi making some reference to this effect at Shimla.

Referring to Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Ajit Jogi''s plea that only people belonging to Chhattisgarh should become the Chief Minister and Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot terming BJP leader and Chief Ministerial contender Vasundare Raje Scindia as an outsider, Naidu hit back at Congress saying for whom ""Italy is in India.""

The BJP President said Congress was in coalition with NCP in Maharashtra but its President Sharad Pawar had raised Gandhi''s foreign origin issue.

""Congress should do some introspection. All these issues are going to boomerang on them"", he warned.

15,A repeat of Ernakulam bypolls looms large,"NEW DELHI: The bypoll results of Ernakulam, where the official Congress nominee lost to an Independent, may just be the harbinger of things to come. With another bypoll due in Kerala on December 1 in Thiruvalla, demoralised Congress workers say if quick remedial steps are not taken, Ernakulam could be repeated there.

Already, Karunakaran''s faction is planning the strategy for the Thiruvalla bypoll. Differences between chief minister A K Antony and K Karunakaran have been on for almost 35 years. Party workers have had enough of their bickerings. They now want neutral people to head the party.

The names doing the rounds are Meghalaya governor M M Jacob and former Union minister Mullappally Ramachandran. Both are close to Congress president Sonia Gandhi and represent south and north Kerala respectively. When contacted in Shillong, Jacob said, ""I am holding a neutral position. It wouldn''t be right on my part to comment on this.""

On his part, Ramachandran said from Thiruvananthapuram that he would abide by whatever decision the high command took. He agreed that the state of the Congress in Kerala was bad.

""Sonia Gandhi should intervene immediately. We can''t afford to send even one worker away. That''ll only benefit the Left.""
