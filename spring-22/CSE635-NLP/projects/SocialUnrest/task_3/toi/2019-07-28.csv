0,Jaitley rules out change in leadership,"AHMEDABAD: BJP general secretary Arun Jaitley on Saturday ruled out the possibility of any change in leadership and declared that former Chief Minister Keshubhai Patel would not be made state party president.

He said this in response to speculations of a possible move in this direction.

Jaitley, who has had two rounds of talk with Keshubhai after the latter participated in the state executive meet, refused to comment as to what role the ex-CM would play in the coming assembly elections. ""You will come to know about this in due course of time"", he told addressing newspersons soon after his first meeting with the state''s senior leaders.

""The issue about changing the state party leadership has not been discussed at any level"", Jaitley claimed. There has been no demand for this either, he added, thus putting a dampener on those who felt the state''s caste equation will tilt favourably towards the BJP in case Keshubhai accepted the state party leadership.

""Keshubhai is our friend, philosopher and guide. He is one of the most senior leaders of the party. He has been guiding the party since the Jana Sangh days. He''s done an excellent work in fighting the quake aftermath"", Jaitley said, avoiding the controversial issue as to why then, was he strapped off his chief ministership . ""I disagree he is unhappy. As for the leadership change, that is an internal party matter.""

Jaitley insisted that the state should go to polls, in a way that it complies with the constitutional provision of Article 174 of holding one assembly session and the next within six months.

""We have made a representation in this regard to the Election Commission, which will take a decision after a detailed assessment of the situation.""

Jaitley, who participated in the state party''s effort to finalise poll programme, said, the elections will be held under chief minister Narendra Modi''s supervision . Denying that the BJP had demanded the imposition President''s rule in J&K, he added, ""It is the Congress which was upfront demanding that President''s rule be imposed both in J&K and Gujarat. It only reflects their reluctance to contest elections. Early polls is a democratic necessity.""

Suggesting ''Hindutva'' would be an important poll plank, Jaitley said, ""Aspirations of the people of the state would be fully taken care of, during the campaign."" Other issues that would be taken up soon during the campaign, would be announced later. This will include, the ruling BJP''s performance in the coalition government, its dynamism, and its strong sense of nationalism.""

Terming Gujarat''s situation as ""normal for polls"", he said, ""If elections can be held in J&K and Assam despite disturbances, why not in Gujarat.""

1,Rising sons set to take the political field,"MUMBAI: They are sassy, smartâ€” and sons. As Maharashtraâ€™s â€˜netasâ€™ try to piece together the jigsaw puzzle of power politics, their â€˜betasâ€™ seem all set to roll out of the wings, never mind the carefully cultivated hesitation.

Says Amit Vilasrao Deshmukh with the dead-pan expression of a veteran practitioner of the art of the impossible, â€œMy job is to assist my father. Politics is a distant thunder.â€™â€™

With a flourishing sugar cooperative factory under his beltâ€”the Rs crore Vikas Sahakari Sakhar Karkhana at Latur was inaugurated by Congress president Sonia Gandhi last Octoberâ€”Deskmukh has arrived, say political observers.

His monthly trek to Latur, the hometown of the Deshmukhs and the chief ministerâ€™s assembly constituency, is chiefly to humour the countless voters. â€œThe constituency has to be nursed and people have to be re-assured that their problems are being taken care of,â€™â€™ he says, adding, Frankly, I am doing my bit for my father.â€™â€™

Nilesh Narayan Rane, 21, did the same thing when Dad set the political cauldron boiling in the state last month by weaning away scores of dissident MLAs from the ruling Democratic Front. As the crisis deepened, the MLAs had to be shepherded to Raj Bhavan for an audience with the governor.

The Shiv Sena leader chose Nilesh Rane for the task and the dutiful son sped away to Malabar Hill, the prized booty in his Toyota-Qualis.

â€œPolitics is not a four-letter word as many believe. I think politics is about power that can be harnessed for the good of the people,â€™â€™ says Mr Rane, who often tours the coastal region of Konkan, his fatherâ€™s political fiefdom. â€œThereâ€™s still lot to be done in the villages of Maharashtra. Pure drinking water is still a scarcity.

Unemployment, law and order crises and the population explosion are evils that need to be addressed immediately,â€™â€™ declares the Boston-returned scion with an accent that could send the Senaâ€™s sons-of-thesoil into a tizzy.

Sanjay Singh was also in the US of A two years ago to be trained as pilot. But the 20-something loves to spend time in Mumbaiâ€™s northwest suburbs, which is the assembly constituency of his father, Kripashankar Singh.

Says the younger Singh, â€œWhen papa is not around, I meet common citizens and listen to their woes. If his burden can be lightened, so much the better, naa?â€™â€™

Entrepreneur Pankaja Munde-Palwe, senior BJP leader Gopinath Mundeâ€™s daughter, looks forward to campaigning for â€˜Babaâ€™. â€œCome election and I am prepared with my kit to join Babaâ€™s poll bandwagon. Meeting ordinary folks, villagers and farmers, is a mind-boggling experience,â€™â€™ says Ms Munde-Palwe, a business management graduate from Seton Hall University, New Jersey.

The pin-up boys of Maharashtraâ€™s politics have impeccable credentials, famous lineage and dollops of ambition. Will they? Wonâ€™t they?

â€œPolitics engages my attention, but I donâ€™t see myself pursuing a career in â€˜raaj-neetiâ€™,â€™â€™ says Ms Munde-Palwe, adding, â€œBut whenever my father wants me to help him, I will be there.â€™â€™ Says Nilesh Rane, â€œPolitics envelops us all. Itâ€™s difficult to resist its pull.â€™â€™

Yet, Generation Next will have to bide its time. â€œPresent-day politics is marked with uncertainties. Coalitions are made and unmade before we can say â€˜Cheersâ€™ to a new regime,â€™â€™ observes Sanjay Singh. While Papas do the tightrope walk in Maharashtraâ€™s political circus, the â€˜baba-logâ€™ can chill out in the nearest pub. Cool, isnâ€™t it? â€œNope. I am not a party animal. I love to watch TVâ€”soccer matches or suspense thrillers, and sometimes I go out for dinner with my family,â€™â€™ says Mr Rane, who works out daily in his personal gym.

Mr Singh is calorie-crazy too, jogging and all that jazz. â€œI may hang out with my friends in a restaurant on, say, Saturday night. But no, I donâ€™t go overboard,â€™â€™ he says. Ms Munde-Palwe,who is married to US-based Dr Charudatta Palwe, loves to read ancient Indian history and listen to vintage Hindi melodies.

And Amit Deshmukh, who is rushing to Latur this week, will he listenting intently to his car stereoâ€”to a tape of his Dadâ€™s latest speech.

2,Development takes back seat: Pramod,"LUCKNOW: Taking a potshot at the bickering between the coalition partners on Saturday, Congress legislature party leader Pramod Tiwari alleged that the mutual mud-slinging campaign being carried on by both the parties in power had become a matter of public concern.

Worse, Tiwari said, was their attempts at airing their differences through press conferences and media leaks. This exercise of â€˜washing dirty linen in publicâ€™ was sending very wrong signals in the state as it put a big question mark over the very survival of the government, he claimed.

Blaming this â€˜show of dissentâ€™ for the tardy development, Tiwari alleged that the lack of faith and consensus among the ruling partners and the resultant confusion had led to an administrative inertia. â€œNo one is interested in doing their duties as they are watching their antics, he said. â€œBoth the BSP and the BJP,â€� he added, â€œshould devise ways of sorting out their problems in a manner which does not make them a butt of joke among the masses.â€�

The ongoing controversy, he alleged, had relegated the more pressing issues facing the state to background. For instance, all the senior BJP leaders were camping in Delhi. He also criticised the criterion for selection of the drought-hit districts, saying the yardsticks adopted were anything but realistic.

3,15 injured in Nigohan clash,"LUCKNOW: Fifteen persons, including three women, were injured in a group clash in Nigohan police circle on the outskirts of the state capital on Saturday evening.

The cause of clash was stated to be a dispute over a drain and two of the injured were said to be in a critical condition.

Fifteen persons from both the sides were arrested by the police. The incident took place in Shekhank Khera village around 4:00 pm where two residents Bahadur and Sakttu started quarrelling over passage for drainage.

A local resident, had allegedly grabbed Gram Sabha land in the village to construct his house, the waste water drain of which opened outside the locality. Another resident Sakttu, who had also allegedly grabbed Gram Sabha land, on Saturday evening wanted to connect his drain to that of Bahadurâ€™s on the ground that it was a public sewage drain. Bahadur, however, insisted that it was his private drain.

The issue took a violent turn when Bahadur and his associates came face to face with Sakttu and his men. The two sides clashed, leaving 15 persons injured. Police reached the site and dispersed the warring groups by using mild force. The injured where shifted to the local primary health centre from where two of them were referred to hospital while the rest were discharged after being given first aide.

Counter FIRs were lodged by the two sides in connection with the incident and 15 persons were arrested. The injured were identified as Bahadurâ€™s nephew Asharfi, Tukki Lal, Kaalu, Putti Lal, Mehrdi Lal and his wife Maya while from the other side were Sakttu, his sons Sahejram and Pooran Mansi, besides Sunil and his father Nand Lal. Sakttuâ€™s wife Maya Devi and Bhagween Devi were the two other women injured in the clash.

4,Bajaj gears up to rally scooter sales,"PUNE: Riding high on the success of its motorcycles and three-wheelers last year, Bajaj Auto Ltd. (BAL) chairman and managing director Rahul Bajaj on Saturday said his company will focus on pushing up the sales of scooters in a big way in the current fiscal.

Addressing the 57th annual general meeting (AGM) of BAL, Bajaj said the scooter segment still has the potential to contribute to the companyâ€™s growth in substantial measure. â€œWhat needs to be done is to combine the positives of a scooter with the virtues of a motorcycle,â€� he said. While admitting that BALâ€™s scooter sales had gone down by 6.4 per cent, despite launching the Chetak with a four-stroke engine, Bajaj said the company nevertheless pushed up its market share from 73 to 76 per cent.

Bajaj also announced the plan to launch a new entrylevel bike code-named CBM (College Boys Motorcycle) by September-end. A new variant of the non-gear Saffire scooterette will also be launched in the second quarter of the current fiscal.

Bajaj attributed the companyâ€™s 103 per cent rise in operating profits in 2001-02 to the excellent performance of its bikes, CNG three-wheelers (and a trimmed workforce).

The company sold 6,56,000 bikes in 2001-02 , registering a 55 per cent improvement in performance.

As a result, Bajaj Auto posted a profit after tax of Rs 5.21 billion as compared to Rs 2.63 billion in 2000-01. The company plans to give due emphasis to the export of two and three-wheelers in the coming year. While BAL had already entered markets of Malaysia and Brazil through strategic partners in those countries, efforts are on to develop a market for Bajaj auto vehicles in Egypt, Peru and elsewhere in Latin America.

Laying down the future objectives of the company, BAL president Rajiv Bajaj said customer, technology and employees would be the priority in future. He said BAL had reduced the front-line management to just four levels and would reduce it further by per cent. The company targets to sell 1.54 million vehicles in all in the current fiscal, of which bikes will account for nine lakh units.

Rajiv said the company plans to introduce a sophisticated four-stroke engine with emission levels of just 0.75 grams per kilometre even though the permissible level is 1.5 gm/km. Four new scooters with state-of-the-art features and innovations were currently under development, he said. Madhur Bajaj and Shekhar Bajaj, cousins the BAL chairman, were also present at the AGM, besides the other directors.

5,Parties blame govt apathy,"PATNA: Political parties have taken serious view of the state governmentâ€™s indifference towards the people reeling in unprecedented flood waters which have submerged large areas in the entire north Bihar.

While the marooned villagers were fighting for their lives, the government was discussing the strategy to be adopted for launching relief operation.

Congress leader Kripanath Pathak said that lakhs of people had been rendered homeless in Darbhanga, Sitamarhi, Sheohar, Supaul, Saharsa, Katihar, Khagaria, Muzaffarpur and East Champaran districts and all road and rail communications had been snapped in the flooded areas.

As the state government had failed in the proper upkeep of embankments along various rivers such as Gandak, Adhwara group of rivers, Kamla Balan, Bagmati, Kosi, Mahananda and Lakhdevi, the fury of the floods has known no bounds. â€œThe government should use army helicoptersâ€�, he said.

BJP state president Nandkishore Yadav said the BJP had, after studying the causes of the 1975-76 flood, forewarned the state government in a report that the floods this year would be worse. Union minister of state for commerce Rajiv Pratap Rudi said that massive cutting of trees on the Indo-Nepal border was the main reason behind the recurring flood in north Bihar.

6,PMC loses Rs 1 crore over development plan,"PUNE: The civic standing committee is all set to pump in Rs 1 crore to get global consultants McKinsey and Company to prepare an infrastructure development plan for the city.

But the shocking reality is that at least half a dozen similar reports, commissioned for similar sums, have been scrapped by the Pune municipal corporation (PMC) in the recent past.

All this at the tax-payersâ€™ cost as fees paid to these consultants has gone down the drain after reports tabled by them were rejected outright by the civic body for one reason or another.

Two years ago, the PMC had appointed the Institute of Indian Infrastructure Engineering (IIIE), a Bangalore-based company, to prepare a development plan (DP) for 38 villages on the fringes of Pune.

The draft DP prepared by the company was scrapped by the civic body with corporators accusing the company planners of meting out injustice to farmers and favouring builders while earmarking the reservations for civic amenities.

Around Rs 1.14 crore was paid as consultancy fees to IIIE. PMC officials are now busy preparing a fresh DP!

In 2001, the Pune Municipal Transport (PMT) and the Pimri-Chinchwad Municipal Transport (PCMT) had jointly awarded a Rs 5-lakh contract to the Central Institute of Road Transport (CIRT) for preparing a report on sharing of routes between the two transport undertakings. However, the report was rejected last year, with the PMT administration saying it favoured PCMT.

In 1995-96, a Rs 1-crore contract was awarded to Kirloskar Consultants to prepare a plan for augmentation of water and sewage system in Pune. After the consultants tabled a Rs 750-crore project report â€” and the PMC floated tenders for executing it â€” corporators accused the consultants of inflating the project cost.

The civic body then scrapped the Kirloskar project, appointed corporators on committees and came up with the present Rs 344-crore plan.

7,MLA’s son commits suicide in Howrah,"KOLKATA: Sovan Sardar, son of Sankrail MLA and Trinamul Congress leader Susil Sardar, committed suicide by hanging himself from the ceiling of a lodge in Howrah early on Saturday.

The cause of the suicide remains a mystery.

On Friday evening, Sovan had left home for Shantiniketan, where he was an undergraduate student of Geology at the Visva-Bharati University.

He, however, did not board the train but checked in at Chandralok Lodge un-der the fictitious name Tarak Mondal.

After dinner, he told the lodge employees not to disturb him as he in-tended to sleep till late.

When Sovan did not respond to repeated knocks even at 11.30 pm, they clambered up the skylight and saw him hanging from the ceiling by a nylon rope.

The Golabari police were informed immediately. After breaking open the door, they found a suicide note stating that no one was responsible for his death. After searching his bag, his true identity was established.

The police then contacted Bolpur police station to ascertain his residential address.

Sovanâ€™s father was asked to come to the Golabari police station, where he fell unconscious on hearing about his sonâ€™s death.

He later identified the body. Apparently a bright student, Shovan never gave his parents any inkling of depression.

However, teachers at the university had reported to his parents a few days ago that he was paying less attention to his studies.

In another incident, housewife poisoned her two minor daughters before commiting suicide in Birbhum district, police said on Saturday.

Namita Mandal (36) poisoned Malina (13) and Maumita (3) before consuming insecticide at Deriapur village under Saithia police station, they said. Family problem was reported to be the reason behind the incident.

8,Chaos at borders as trucks turned back,"NEW DELHI: Chaotic scenes were witnessed at the Delhi borders on Saturday, especially at the ones shared with Uttar Pradesh, as trucks formed queues several kilometres long. They were being checked for consignment notes and those not carrying goods for Delhi were turned back.

Between 11 am and 5 pm, when the borders are open for heavy vehicles, about 1,350 vehicles were stopped and turned back. â€˜â€˜These vehicles were not carrying goods for Delhi,â€™â€™ said joint commissioner of police (traffic) Maxwell Pereira.

Although no untoward incident was reported till evening, onlookers said the chaos was apparent on the UP side. â€˜â€˜Haryana had done some homework. Gurgaon police was patrolling the area and were managing trucks at their end. But UP Police and administration did not put in much effort,â€™â€™ a traffic official, who monitored several check points, said.

At 42 check points, traffic police officials were seen flagging down trucks and checking their consignment notes. â€˜â€˜These points were located where the roads were wide and U-turns were available,â€™â€™ a traffic police official said. Trucks which entered the city were stopped in the left lanes and their documents were checked.

On an average, five traffic police teams on each of the 42 check points were deployed, depending on the traffic volume. â€˜â€˜Complete details of turned back vehicles have been noted by the checking officials,â€™â€™ an official said.

Registration numbers, names and licence details of the driver, the ownersâ€™ details, the trucksâ€™ origin and destination were recorded.

Most truckers, however, were confused. Some of them were caught unawares and pleaded ignorance. Others said they be allowed in for the sake of the recipients who would otherwise suffer.

At Maharajpur border, of the 500 trucks entering Delhi, 116 were turned back. Long queues were seen at Apsara border where at least 250 trucks had piled up on the UP side.

Hukum Singh, a trucker who was stranded at Tikri border, said he would have to travel about 100 km extra to reach his destination. â€˜â€˜It will mean more fuel and time,â€™â€™ he said.

Although entry for the trucks was closed at 5 pm, the real test for the traffic police would be at night when the borders would be opened. â€˜â€˜We are going to deploy five teams on an average at night as well,â€™â€™ Pereira said.

9,Bad result? No increment for school heads,"BANGALORE: In a sweeping decision, the education department here has decided to cut increments of heads of government schools which have obtained less than 20 per cent results in SSLC examination.

Over the last few years, the department had adopted a pro-active approach to schools, which secured poor results. It had directed the department officials to adopt schools with poor pass percentage and attach special importance to teaching/ learning in such schools. This is the first time the department has decided to punish heads and teachers for non-performance.

The department has identified 1,500 government and 750 private schools, which have registered 20 per cent to 30 per cent results. Warnings would be issued to schools which have obtained less than 30 per cent results.

Confirming the decision, Commissioner for Public Instruction T.M. Vijayabhaskar told Times News Network that one increment each would be cut for last yearâ€™s (2001) and this yearâ€™s (2002) poor result.

10,Inflation rate inches up to 2.48 per cent,"NEW DELHI: Inflation rate registered a 0.49 per cent increase to touch 2.48 per cent for the week ended July 13 due to hike in primary articles and fuel prices.

Inflation rate based on Wholesale Price Index stood at 1.99 per cent in previous week and 5.29 per cent a year ago. WPI for second week of July rose to 165.1 from 164.4 in the previous week and 161.1 a year ago, mainly due to 0.5 per cent rise in prices of primary articles and 1.5 per cent hike in fuel prices.

Final WPI for week ended May 18, stood at 162.7 as against the provisional figure of 162.8 while final inflation rate stood at 1.25 per cent as against the provisional figure of 1.43 per cent. Primary Articles index rose to 171.7 during the week from 170.9 in previous week and 168.3 a year ago, due to hike in prices of food article by 0.3 per cent, non-food articles by 0.8 per cent and minerals by 0.1 per cent.

Food Articles index went up to 178.4 from 177.8 a week ago due to costly maize, fruits and vegetables (two per cent each), jowar, bajra, gram, masur and eggs (one per cent each). However, barley was cheaper by three per cent and tea by two per cent.

Non-food Articles index rose to 159.2 during the week from 158 in previous week due to higher prices of niger seed (36 per cent), raw tobacco (five per cent), copra (four pc), raw cotton, rape and mustard seed, cotton seed and linseed (two per cent each), soyabean and raw rubber (one pc each).

However, raw silk was cheaper by nine per cent, mesta by four per cent and raw jute by two per cent.

11,Trial in Ramesh Kini suicide case to begin tomorrow,"MUMBAI: Six years after city resident Ramesh Kini died under mysterious circumstances in a theatre at Pune, the trial in the case which evoked a political controversy would commence in a sessions court here on Monday with the prosecution examining its first witness.

Kini''s death had raked up a controversy with police charging Shiv Sena leader Raj Thackeray with the conspiracy leading to Kini''s death. The CBI, however, exonerated him from the charges.

On June 27, Judge S P Nikam had framed charges against Kini''s landlords Laxmichand Shah and his son Suman. Altogether 130 witnesses have been cited by the prosecution in this case. Laxmichand and Suman have been charged with section 306 IPC (abetment of suicide), section 386 IPC (extortion by putting victim in fear of death) read with section 34 IPC (common intention) and section 120-b IPC (conspiracy).

Another accused Ashuthosh Rane, a Vidyarthi Sena leader, was discharged on April four by the trial court due to lack of evidence. Kini was found dead on June 23, 1996 at Alka theatre in Pune. A bottle of cyanide was found in his pocket. Police initially suspected suicide but later it was alleged that he consumed the substance under pressure from the accused.

The case of the prosecution is that the landlords of Kini wanted him to vacate the rented premises and pressurised him time and again. It was alleged that they sought help of Sena leaders Ashutosh Rane and Raj Thackeray in this regard.

Public Prosecutor S L Deshpande would conduct the trial while noted criminal lawyers Harshad Ponda, Satish Maneshinde and Sayaji Nangre would defend the accused.

12,Indo-Nepal treaty should be reviewed: Bengal minister,"GANGTOK: West Bengal government has reiterated its demand for a review of the Indo-Nepal treaty of 1950 in a bid to block the entry of miscreants to the country.

""Some miscreants are misusing it by entering our country and bringing smuggled goods via West Bengal. If we have to stop this menace, the treaty should be reviewed,"" state Urban Development Minister Ashok Bhattacharya told a meet-the-press programme at the press club here yesterday.

West Bengal Chief Minister Buddhadev Bhattacharjee had urged Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani a few months back to review the treaty to which the latter agreed, he said. Bhattacharya, who hails from West Bengal''s Siliguri, which has been a corridor of Indo-Nepal border, said some ISI agents were taking this route from Nepal and other neighbouring countries to create problems in India.

Under the treaty, both Indian and Nepalese nationals do not require passport and visa to enter each other''s territory. Referring to the Bhutan refugee issue, the Minister said the CPI-M party supported their cause and ''pro-democracy'' movement in the Himalayan Kingdom. ""But that does not mean people from that country will come to our place and settle down here permanently. How long we will give them the shelter?"" he said.

13,"3,000 trucks turned away from city","NEW DELHI: Over 3,000 trucks were prevented from entering the city on Saturday and Sunday morning. Irate truckers continued to vent their anger by causing traffic jams at several entry points of Delhi.

â€˜â€˜From 11 am on Saturday to 7 am on Sunday, over 3,000 trucks were turned back from the border as they were not carrying goods for the city,â€™â€™ said deputy commissioner of police, traffic, Satish Golcha, on Sunday.

The Supreme Court had recently ruled that inter-state trucks not carrying goods for Delhi should not be allowed to pass through the city. The situation at the Apsara and Badarpur borders, where truck drivers had queued up hoping to gain entry into the city, showed little signs of improvement as the commercial vehicles continued to clog the road leading to the check points.

Golcha claimed no untoward incident was reported on Sunday and the build-up at some entry points had started to clear.

The traffic police have selected over 40 points on the cityâ€™s borders with other states to check the consignment notes of trucks heading for the city. Golcha claimed they were maintaining a record of trucks being turned away but were not aware of the number of trucks which entered the city ever since the Supreme Court orders were enforced.

The traffic police have started creating a data bank on the trucks which prefer to use the city roads. Details like a truckâ€™s origin point, destination and its ownerâ€™s name were being recorded along with its registration number for future reference, said a traffic police official.

The confusion at border entry points mounted as trucks carrying goods for Delhi had to struggle for space on roads jammed with those which were stopped from entering the city.

The traffic police are hoping the pressure maintained by them would bear results soon when the news of entry restrictions spreads by word of mouth.

14,BKU protests power cuts,"BATHINDA: Hundreds of Bharatiya Kisan Union members blocked traffic at many places, on Sunday, in protest against the long power cuts imposed in the area.

In Bathinda, about 400 BKU members, including women, sat on dharna in the middle of the Bathinda-Barnala road near Bucho Khurd village, about 14 km from here on Sunday and blocked the traffic for nearly four hours. The traffic from the main road was later diverted via Bibiwala village.

According to the BKU, the traffic was blocked on the following roads: Bathinda-Barnala, Muktsar-Bathinda, Bathinda-Ferozepur, Sunam-Jakhal, Patiala-Bathinda, Ferozepur-Ludhiana from 12 to 4 pm on Sunday.

BKU president Joginder Singh and general Secretary Sukhdev Singh Kokri Kalan demanded an increase in the compensation for drought-affected farmers.

The BKU leaders have asked the state government to give compensation of Rs 15,000 per acre to the affected farmers.

While criticising the state government for clamping 4 per cent sales tax on fertilisers, pesticides and insecticides, the leader demanded that the hike be withdrawn.

The union leader asked the state government to provide 50 per cent subsidy on diesel to help the farmers overcome the power-crisis in the state.

The BKU has also asked for the provision of canal water for irrigation. The BKU leaders also asked for 24-hours power supply to run tubewells with.

The leaders alleged that the state government has turned their back on the farmers after having come to power in the state.

15,Drought forces farmers to work as labourers,"JALANDHAR: A new face has joined the daily commuters on the Delhi-Jammu Tawi Express and Hisar-Jakhal-Ludhiana train that halt at Sunam in the morning.

A large number of farmers from Rae Dhrahna, Nilowal, Chajali, Bigadwal, Bhai-ki-Pishore and numerous other villages around Sunam board the trains. And the numbers are swelling each year, each day.

The next stop is at Sangrur. The farmers step out quickly and briskly walk towards city Kotwali and Nabha Gate that has come to be known as labour chowk.

The faces from the big crowd of daily labourers look at them expectantly. But to their utter shock they find that they have not come there to pick up as they used to earlier but to join their ranks.

The hands, which for times immemorial have been ploughing fields and reaping a harvest, do not know white-washing or painting, nor are they well-versed with the job of a mistry (mason).

But with grit and determination they wait till on the condition of a cut, a mason takes them for lifting bricks and lifting baskets.

This is one of the cumulative fallouts of the vicious wheatpaddy cycle which has been brought into focus sharply by the serious crisis in the villages of Punjab this season.

Experts and farm leaders call it one of the first consequences in the â€œPost Green revolution era and the capital intensive unnatural farming practice and the jinxed vicious paddy-wheat cycle.â€�

This is the story of many a small farmer who has taken heavy loans for pesticides, fertilisers, diesel and agricultural equipment.

They had to mortgage and sell off their lands to clear the debts, according to Baljeet Singh (a resource person of Social Sciences and Health Forum and consultant to The National Literacy Mission) and Prem Kumar who interacted with these and many more farmers at labour chowks of Sangrur and other cities of Malwa belt.

Quoting from the Shergill Committee report Baljit Singh said: â€œThe small farmers are unable to pay about one-third of the loan to the commission agents even after selling the whole crop. In 1996-97, the approximate burden of loans on the Punjabi farmers was about Rs 5,700 crore. At the present rate of inflation, this amounts to about Rs 8,380 crore. But even by conservative estimates the actual amount will be much higher than 10,000 crore as during the last five years the situation has worsened as the expenditure on the inputs on the paddywheat cycle have increased.â€�

16,PUCL raps govt for failure of talks,"HYDERABAD: Peopleâ€™s Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL) president K G Kannabiran on Sunday alleged that the government has no intention to carry on governance without violence, and blamed the police for unleashing violence after the preliminary round of talks with the Peoplesâ€™ War (PW).

In a press release issued here, Kannabiran said: â€œFrom day one of the commencement of the talks, the government and their police were saying that the PW were coming for talks because they have become weak, and that within a short period, they will be liquidated.â€�

â€œSuch assumptions appear to be, prima facie, contrary the facts and the history this movement in the state,â€� he added.

He asked the PW to come out with a statement on the governmentâ€™s accusation that it was violating international human rights, since was recruiting child soldiers for working in the movement in the state.

Kannabiran advised the PW to understand that the failure of the talks does not mean restarting the cycle of violence, unless they understood revolutionary politics to mean violence. People appreciated the PWâ€™s cessation of violence during the talks, he said.

17,YSR flays govt for short session,"HYDERABAD: Opposition leader Y S Rajasekhara Reddy criticised the government for not extending the monsoon session of the Assembly by at least one day for taking up the issue of chief minister N Chandrababu Naiduâ€™s `unkept promisesâ€™.

â€œDue to the sudden demise of vice-president Krishan Kant, the session was adjourned abruptly on the last day when the issue of chief ministerâ€™s promises was scheduled to come up and our requests to extend the session by one more day were not conceded. The Congress will nevertheless take up the issue at all levels to mount pressure on the government to fulfil the promises made by the chief minister,â€� said Rajasekhara Reddy.

Speaking to reporters on Sunday, he criticised the government for fixing the number of days of the assembly session at 50, despite the recommendations made by the speakersâ€™ conference for convening the sessions for 120 days in a year.

â€œThe government takes the pretext of governance for cutting short the session. But as long as the delegation of powers is proper, the government will not find it difficult to convene the assembly for at least 90 days,â€� he pointed out.

Referring to proceedings in the monsoon session, the opposition leader said that the Congress succeeded in pressurising the government to constitute two House committees to probe into the collapse of 400 KV transmission towers, and the scholarship scandal which rocked the state recently.

â€œThe proceedings, however, clearly demonstrated that the government only conceded to the opposition demand in which corruption among TDP ranks would not figure,â€� he said.

Reddy also expressed dissatisfaction over the disruption of proceedings by the ruling party members.
