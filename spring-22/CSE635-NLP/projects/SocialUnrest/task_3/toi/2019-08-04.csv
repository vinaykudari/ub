""Next year, we are approaching assembly elections in 10 states. Thus, there is an increasing danger of the Gujarat-like communal violence. And the Opposition, including the Congress, does not have a mechanism to counter communal violence.""

1,Report indicts Akalis in Malout clash,"BATHINDA: An eleven-member fact-finding committee of Sarb Hind Shiromani Akali Dal (SHSAD) on a clash between some Sikh politico-religious organisation and police at Malout on Wednesday accused some Akali leaders of the area for fomenting trouble to gain political benefits.

SHSADâ€™s general secretary Prem Singh Chandumajra declared on Saturday that his party would not participate in the all-Sikh religious bodiesâ€™ meeting called by Joginder Singh Vedanti in Amritsar on August 5 to discuss Ashutosh Baba issue. While speaking to mediapersons on Saturday evening here, Chandumajra told that the SHSAD had decided to boycott the meeting because Jathedar Vedanti was not acting fairly in dealing with the detractors of Sikh religion.

Though Karnail Kaur, daughter of former agriculture minister Gurdev Singh Badal had admitted of being follower of Ashutosh, Vedanti was maintaining silence on the issue he added. He said the inquiry report had found that some Akali leaders of Muktsar area were hand in gloves with some anti-panthic agencies who were providing money to the so-called babas and sadhus to damage Sikh religion and its philosophy.

He alleged that some Akali leaders were supporting anti-panthic agencies and Babas for ulterior motive. Accusing the state government for belated action against Ashutosh, he said the antecedents of Ashutosh should be inquired by the government.

He told that the report would be submitted to the party president Gurcharan Singh Tohra on Sunday evening for further necessary action.

2,Ansari aides say they had political backing,"LUCKNOW: The arrest of six close associates of Mukhtar Ansari has opened a new chapter in the underworld for the investigating agencies following startling revelations by the accused regarding the level of political patronage being enjoyed by them.

The American Magnum revolver recovered from the possession of the accused was reportedly given to them by a close kin of the chief minister of an agriculturally rich state and the nephew of a former chief minister of one of these states had helped the gang to form their base outside UP.

The accused revealed that Mukhtarâ€™s interest in firearms and ammunition and his knowledge on the subject struck a chord with Dimpy, a former terrorist and close relative of a former chief minister of a state bordering Delhi. Dimpy helped Mukhtar in Rungta kidnapping case and later was arrested. He, however, got himself transferred to Banglore jail from where he escaped. He is still a fugitive but believed to be a frequent visitor to his hideouts in Haryana and Punjab. Dimpy was closely associated with Gurmeet Singh alias Baba who was also involved in the Rungta kidnapping case and was being tried in the court. A native of Himayunpur locality of Fatehgarh district in Punjab, the prime accused Gurmeet disclosed during interrogation that the gang had a safe haven in Panchkola area of sector 7 in Haryana and had been their hideout since 1993. Mukhtar had been a frequent visitor to the hideout and had floated a parallel base there for refuge as and when the heat was turned up on him by the police in Uttar Pradesh.

One of the accused revealed that as of now, the gang was mainly into buying and selling of sophisticated arms and ammunition in Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh. The American Magnum revolver which was recovered from their possession was given to them by the kin of a chief minister to be sold off in UP. While the firearm was fetching a meagre Rs 5 lakh elsewhere, it was expected to fetch something around Rs 7 to 8 lakh in UP and Bihar. The accused also revealed about their deals with at least four arms and ammunition dealers in the state capital, who had earlier helped them to dispose of Star pistols and other sophisticated weapons. The investigating agencies have not ruled out the possibility of the American revolver being a licensed one but in the name of a political figure.

4,"Cong begins campaign, Surat rally on Aug 9","SURAT: Make hay while the sun shines is what the Congress appears to believe in considering the urgency with which they are initiating measures to build vote banks in South Gujarat region, in view of the forthcoming Assembly elections. However, the desperate measures to woo the voters by forming federations of representatives of textile traders for a large support base here appear to run into rough weathers, with divisions among the traders coming to the fore. The Congress, as part of their measures to woo voters, is taking out a rally on August 9 in the city and in this connection, the party has sought support from the Federation of South Gujarat Textiles (traders, weavers and processors) Association at a meeting convened by the association early this week. However, the ''democratically''-elected Federation of Surat Textile Traders Association (FSTTA) in its meet held on Wednesday announced that the call for taking part in the rally is just out-of-question. According to FSTTA vice-president Dev Krishna Meghani, the business community would prefer to stay away from such political game plans. Meghani told TNN that FSTTA is an elected body of representatives of textile traders and anyone claiming to represent the traders by forming an association, for political gains of a few, would be strongly objected. Over 40,000 shops in 92 textile markets are represented in the FSTTA, Meghani said. Without seeking any official permission, some among the traders have formed a separate federation for their own political interests, he added. When asked, the local Congress leaders said that around 200 textile traders had met AICC general secretary and Gujarat in-charge Kamal Nath and expressed support for the Congress and also promised to take part in large number in the scheduled rally on August 9. GPCC economic cell chairman Rupin Patchigar said the rally would be organised by the Congress and the textile traders, who would hold a meeting at the textile market, would join the rally on their own. City Congress president Jawahar Upadhyay said that the party has taken up all the measures to mobilise the workers and the voters at the ward levels in the city. Out of 33, almost all the wards have been covered so far. He said the support by textile traders during the rally on August 9 has been extended on their own. However, FSTTA representatives said that all the shops would remain open on August 9 and no markets would be closed, as announced by some traders'' groups. For the political parties, it is wait and watch situation as of now, as the rally by the Congress would be a sort of parameter on which the mindset of the mass could be analysed to plan the election strategy, according to political observers here.

5,"Home Trade chief gets bail, re-arrested","MUMBAI: Home Trade Ltd. CEO Sanjay Agarwal, prime accused in the Rs 92.78 crore seamenâ€™s provident fund scam, was on Saturday released on bail by a special court, but in another case he was remanded to police custody till August 8.

In the seamenâ€™s PF scam case, designated judge S.G. Deshmukh released him on a sum of Rs 20 lakh with one surety of the like amount. He was granted bail as CBI had failed to file chargesheet within 60 days of his arrest.

In Cr.PC where offences are punishable with death or life or ten yearsâ€™ imprisonment, chargesheet has to be filed within 90 days, but for offences with less than ten years the stipulated period is 60 days.

However, in the Rs 5.4 crore Raghuvanshi Co-operative Bank scam case, he was remanded to police custody till August 8 by magistrate B.A. Shelar.

The CBI alleged he had siphoned off money through his firms and hence needed to be interrogated to locate the missing funds.

6,Information spurs development: NHRC chairman,"TIRUPATI: National Human Rights Commission chairman Justice J S Verma on Saturday gave a clarion call to ensure human development through the rights based approach and in order to achieve that, right to information is must.

Addressing a national seminar on â€˜Rights-Based Approach to Developmentâ€™ at the Sri Venkateswara University, Tirupati on Saturday, he suggested that a rightsbased approach sets the achievement of human rights as an objective for the development. He called upon the people to unitedly come forward for the protection of human rights. He emphasised that every section of the community must have its own decision-making policy and implementation strategy. Justice Verma called for a united fight against the eradication of poverty besides reducing infant mortality, thereby improving maternal health.

He referred to the Human Rights Commissionâ€™s report about the collective responsibility to uphold the human dignity and equality at the global level. He expressed regret over the discrimination, which was institutionalised by society in gender, community and socio-economic status causing great threat to the global development.

He opined that the human rights and human development were interdependent and there would not be any true development unless these two have common reasons. Justice Verma said economic and environmental sustainability play a major role in the development.

8,Bandh protesting lock up deaths cripples Malda,"MALDA: Two buses were damaged and a Congress MLA was arrested during the 12-hour bandh in Malda town on Saturday protesting the death of two undertrial prisoners from suffocation in the overcrowded court lock-up on Thursday.

The bandh was called by the Congress and the Socialist Unity Centre of India.

Congress MLA Sabitri Mitra was arrested while leading party workers in blocking National Highway 34 in the Rathbari area. She was released on personal bond. Superintendent of police Pankaj Dutta said bandh supporters had damaged two state buses. Congress complained that police made a lathi charge in which Mitra was injured.

Normal life was affected with shops and establishments mostly closed. Public transport was off the roads. Dutta, however, claimed that there was a â€œvery poorâ€� response to the bandh.

The Malda Bar Association took out a procession protesting the custody deaths and demanded severe punishment to those responsible.

The Association for Protection of Democratic Rights held protest meetings at various places and said it would soon release its fact-finding report on the incident.

9,Current phase of elections crucial for BJP: Advani,"AHMEDABAD: Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani said on Sunday BJP was once again experiencing the ""feel good factor"" after a string of recent reverses in Assembly polls and added that the current phase was ""very crucial and critical"" for the party.

Speaking after unveiling an oil painting of Sardar Vallabhai Patel at the new building of Ahmedabad Urban Development Authority here, the BJP leader said the party cadre was ""despondent and depressed after a string of defeats"" in the Assembly elections held in February in Uttaranchal, Uttar Pradesh and Punjab.

""We held threadbare discussion on the electoral defeats at our Goa conclave and concluded that there was a need for a major shake-up in the party and government. I discussed the issue with Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and he agreed with my view and we deputed two of our best ministers Venkaiah Naidu and Arun Jaitely to the organisation,"" he said.

""A handsome mandate in Goa on the basis of governance and performance for BJP, together with the shake-up in the organisation and the Vajpayee government and also the way we tackled the issue of President and Vice President''s elections, have gone to generate a feel good factor in the party,"" Advani said and termed the present phase as very crucial and critical for the party.

Moreover, BJP could put up a good show in Goa despite the opposition Congress trying to capitalise on the incidents that happened in Gujarat following the Godhra train carnage, which was an achievement in itself, he said.

10,Muslim body demands President's rule in Gujarat,"NEW DELHI: The Indian Muslim Political Conference has said that elections should be held in Gujarat only when peace returns to the state and demanded imposition of President''s rule to ensure free and fair elections.

In its resolution adopted after a consultative meeting of the Conference at Aligarh on Saturday, it urged the Election Commission to allow international observers to monitor the elections in Gujarat ""in line with the true spirit of democracy.""

It also appealed to the delegation of the Election Commission, which recently visited Gujarat, ""to throughly assess the situation in the context of the fear of the Muslims and other weaker sections of society"", acording to the resolution sent by the organisation.

The conference condemned the ""anti-Muslim public utterences"" of the leaders of RSS, VHP and Bajrang Dal and demanded the arrest of Ashok Singhal, Pravin Tagodia Giriraj Kishore, Vinay Katiyar, Surindra Jain and Tarun Vijay.

11,"Avoid hasty elections, advise intellectuals","AHMEDABAD: A group of prominent individuals from Ahmedabad, including NGOs and human rights activists, met the Election Commission team on Saturday and said Gujarat was not ready for elections.

In a letter to the team, they said the state government had a clear majority with no threat to its power. ""Such haste smacks of the bloody, charred remains of the recent genocide for political mileage,"" the letter said.

According to official figures, more than 12,000 people are still living in relief camps in Ahmedabad alone, the letter adds and says that those forced to live on in the camps have not received adequate compensation. The signatories felt that at a time when even a slight rumour could send such people scurrying for cover, they cannot be expected to vote with confidence.

They have also said that in times of drought like this year, many people migrate and return to their villages only during Holi festival. Such people may not be able to cast their vote if elections are held soon.

Among the 20 signatories are well-known human rights lawyer Girish Patel, former chief justice of the Rajasthan High Court Justice A P Ravani, professor Darshini Mahadeviya, social activist Swaroop Dhruv, Prashant director Father Cedric Prakash and others.

12,Wide protest over GGCL's hike in gas prices,"SURAT: With no solution in sight to the deadlock over the issue of the recent 10 per cent hike in the gas prices by the Gujarat Gas Company Ltd (GGCL), the protest by textile units of the city with support from domestic consumers is likely to snowball into a major law and order problem, if the agitation by over 1,000 people near the GGCL plant at Adajan on Friday is any indication to go by.

Though the representatives have asked the GGCL authorities to withdraw the hike, in view of the huge profit the company is making even on the existing price structure, till Saturday evening there was no word from the company officials for a dialogue in the matter, according to South Gujarat Textile Processors'' Association (SGTPA) president C R Patil.

The agitation would continue till the hike is withdrawn, Patil told TNN. GGCL has made a profit of over Rs 102 crore and has 47 crore, taken as non-interest bearing deposits from consumers, he said. In such a situation, the company has no justification in hiking the price. GGCL gets LPG from Hazira-based Gas Authority of India Ltd (GAIL) and it supplies the same to the industrial and domestic consumers through pipelines in the city, Patil said.

When contacted, GGCL director P P G Sharma told TNN that the management would like to hold meetings with representatives to sort out the problem. The company is open to talks at anytime, he added.

Meanwhile, the Surat Citizens'' Council Trust (SCCT) managing trustee I J Desai told TNN that GGCL has always increased the rates every year, even though the company has been consistently making profits.

GGCL is distributing the gas, supplied by GAIL, at a cost of Rs 3.84 per cubic metre, inclusive of sales tax. But, GGCL sells one cubic metre of gas at Rs 9.60 to the consumers, according to Desai.

He said SCCT has been making representations for the last two years to GGCL about this unfair hike in the gas price, but nothing has been done in this regard by the company.

13,Violence during polls likely: Congress,"AHMEDABAD: Gujarat Pradesh Congress Committee (GPCC), in a memorandum to the Election Commission delegation, has said that the atmosphere in Gujarat creates doubts about the fairness of the electoral process. The party fears that early elections could lead to fresh bloodbath.

The party said ""the wounds of the mindless violence are still so fresh that even a simple scratch could lead to profuse bleeding"". It said the sanctity of any electoral process would be tested only by the fairness and fearlessness with which it is held. ""Unfortunately the situation is so volatile that the smallest or simplest of individual skirmish leads to mob violence.""

The Congress fears that ""the myth of peace and tranquillity, which is being so vigorously propagated, would be shattered resulting in bloodbath"". It said the Congress would like to verify the electoral rolls to ensure that genuine voters are not left out and bogus names are not included. But printed electoral rolls are still unavailable with the departments concerned.

It would be apt to hold elections only after the verification of electoral rolls. The party said many people, who suffered during the riots and were rendered homeless, are still living in relief camps. Many were even missing and are yet to be traced. Forty-two cities and towns and 58 talukas were severely affected by the riots. The situation in all these areas is not normal.

The party pointed out that elections to over 80 municipalities and many taluka panchayats have been cancelled. In such a situation, it asked, how can election to the Legislative Assembly be held.

14,Congress rally hits out at BJP 'power politics',"AHMEDABAD: An estimated 80,000 supporters and farmers turned out for the rally organised by the Gujarat Pradesh Congress Committee in Deesa town of Banaskantha district on Sunday, in continuance with the party''s election campaign.

Upbeat up by the impressive turnout in a district, GPCC president Shankersinh Vaghela took the opportunity to declare that if voted to power the Congress would supply power to the farmers for 14 hours.

Referring to the recent grid collapse which affected power supply in five states of the western region, both Vaghela and AICC general secretary Kamal Nath scoffed at the BJP allegations of Madhya Pradesh having drawn excess power, saying that ""they (the BJP) cannot manage their own power supply and want to blame others"".

Vaghela also made it a point to mention the Gram Mitra scheme launched by Narendra Modi, and announced that if elected to power, ""the Congress would give an allowance of Rs 2,000 instead of Rs 1,000, to the unemployed youth,"" said a party source.

Although Congress leaders claimed that the turnout touched two lakh, police sources placed the figure at 70,000-80,000. Participating in the rally were AICC members Ahmed Patel, Amarsinh Chaudhary, Bharatsinh Solanki, Urmila Patel, Madhusudan Mistry, Narhari Amin, Naresh Raval, B K Gadhvi and Hasmukh Patel.

At the centre of the huge rally was the slogan ''Congress Laao, Bijlee Paao'', directly hitting out at the alleged anti-farmer policies of the BJP. ""A major part of the assembly comprised local farmers from the district."" MP Mistry said. This is significant given the fact that the district has not given the Congress many political representatives. Several central observers now deputed in Gujarat also participated in the rally.

15,Current elections crucial for BJP: Advani,"AHMEDABAD: Deputy prime minister L K Advani on Sunday exhorted BJP workers to approach people with renewed vigour and confidence and assure them that if returned to power the party would provide good governance aimed at speedy development of the state.

Taking the party into election mode, Advani, without making any mention about when the elections would be held in Gujarat, observed that ""the recent shake-up in the government and the organisation and crucial deliberations at the National Council meeting in New Delhi have boosted the morale of the partymen. He asserted that the ""feel depressed factor"" has been replaced by the ""feel good factor"".

Addressing a function after unveiling an oil painting of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel at the office of Ahmedabad Urban Development Authority (AUDA) here, Advani admitted that the party had lost assembly election in northern states possibly because they were held in the aftermath of the annual budget of the central government. However, he did not elaborate his statement.

""There has been a welcome change in the party''s support base after the Goa conclave where the party emerged victorious in the assembly election, and that too despite the bitter campaign of the Congress against riots in Gujarat."" The minorities in Goa were not carried away by the Opposition and voted for the BJP, he said.

The senior BJP leader exuded confidence that things were changing for better in the party and the government, and said the crucial dialogue in the National Council at Talkatora Stadium on Saturday was its proof.

Advani, who represents Gandhinagar constituency in the Lok Sabha, was all praise for the works carried out by AUDA in last four years. He also felicitated Mohsin Shaikh, a local artist who made Sardar Patel''s oil painting.

Advani said he had plans to inaugurate a 21-feet statue of Sardar Patel installed at New Jersey. He said he has been invited by Non-Resident Gujaratis who have spent more than Rs 1 crore on the statue.

17,Congress MPs protest railway function invitations,"AHMEDABAD: The convener of the Congress Parliamentary Party-Gujarat , Pravin Rashtrapal, has protested to the railway authorities over the exclusion of Congress Rajya Sabha member, Raju Parmar, from the list of special invitees at a function to be held at the Ahmedabad railway station to flag off the inter-city train between Ahmedabad and Rajkot.

In a letter of protest to the divisional railway manager at Vadodara , Rashtrapal,who is an MP from Patan, said the railways were trying to provide a political platform to the ruling BJP in view of the coming elections. He said Parmar, a three-time MP from Gujarat, is a native of Ahmedabad and should have been invited to the function as he was also a member of the parliamentary committee on railways.

Rashtrapal said the invitation extended on behalf of the DRM Vadodara says the function will be attended by the deputy prime minister L K Advani and Nitish Kumar apart from ""other dignitories"" like union ministers Dr Vallabh Kathiria , Harin Pathak and Kashiram Rana, MP Bhavna Chikhalia and state ministers Ashok Bhatt, Anandiben Patel , Bharat Barot, Kaushik Patel , Haren Pandya and Gordhan Zadaphia.

Rashtrapal said it was surprising that Chikhalia,who is an MP from Junagadh , is being invited to the function while Parmar , who is from Ahmedabad, had been ignored. He said even Ratilal Verma , the BJP MP from Dhanduka which is in rural Ahmedabad, had not been invited. He suspected that there could also be a ""caste bias"" here because both Verma and Parmar are Dalits.

On being contacted, Parmar said that railways had clearly violated protocol and taken the political line in this case by ommiting his name from the list of special guests. He said ""we are not against the function but we are against it being used for political gains"".

18,Four arrested in riot-murder case,"AHMEDABAD: Four persons residing in Juhapura have been arrested by the Sarkhej police (crime branch) in connection with the murder of one Arjunbhai Ramsinh Gohil.

Gohil had been stoned to death at peak of riot-violence on March 23 near Navrang apartments alongside a road connecting Juhapura and Sarkhej. Gohil, a resident of Vadodara, had been pulled down from the moped he was riding on, killed and then his body set it on fire.

Hours after the incident the police had recovered some of the deceased'' belongings and his moped from the roadside. A case of murder and rioting had been registered at the Aslali police station.

A police team led by police inspector Tarun Barot and police sub-inspector Dharmendrasinh Chauhan raided the Juhapura area late on Friday night and arrested Samir Ali alias Bholu Govar Ali Qadri, Mohammadafroz Abdulsattar Memon, Sohil Mohammadrafiq Dalal and Zakirhussain Ibrahimbhai Bagvan.

Sources said: ""All the accused who have been nabbed reside in Sohil Society of Juhapura, which happens to be stone''s throw away from the scene of crime. Interrogation of the accused have revealed two more names. We hope to make more arrests in this case soon.""

19,Fight election on real issues: NGOs to parties,"AHMEDABAD: Sonal Mehta of the Movement for Secular Democracy has opposed the Congress party and its policies all her life. However, if she thinks it is necessary to support it in the coming state elections just to defeat the BJP, she will not hesitate to do so. Mehta strongly believes that the BJP in Gujarat is seeking a mandate on the basis of the recent communal riots and can not be allowed to succeed.

Mehta was part of a meeting of voluntary agencies in Ahmedabad recently, which have decided that if an election has to be fought in the state, it should be on issues like water and education, not the riots. ""In fact, I believe that there should be a single-point agenda,"" Mehta says, adding, ""Defeat the BJP.""

The meeting was attended by a wide cross-section of voluntary agencies, including Gandhians, NGOs, and individuals. Among them was veteran Gandhian Chunibhai Vaidya. ""There were three kinds of people at the meeting,"" he says, adding, ""There was the first lot that believed the Congress should be openly supported as it was the lesser of the two evils. The second group of people felt it was more important that the failures of the present government should be highlighted and they should stop short of supporting anyone. The third group felt the BJP should be stopped at all costs.""

Vaidya felt that despite their differences, they were all on a single platform, that of putting development issues on the centre-stage.

""I can tell you that in many of the villages people are already tired of talking about the riots when their basic necessities are not being met,"" says Lalji Desai of Marag NGO, which works with the Maldhari community. ""Each time a new issue crops up just before elections, sidelining the real problem of the people. If it is not war with Pakistan, it is the riots. It is about time we fight elections on the basis of real issues.""

However, the issue of development being sidelined is not the only fear of these voluntary bodies. Many of them believe the basic democratic rights of the people are threatened under BJP rule. As Mehta puts it, ""I have been threatened and attacked in the last three months only because I have taken a stand against the riots. If we don''t stand up right now, our voices will be crushed.""

There are others like Stalin K, part of the Citizen''s Initiative, who insist that development NGOs can''t take a clear political stand. ""However, we can definitely talk to the people on what this government has done for them on some of the basic problems that have been plaguing them for years. They should not lose sight of such issues. Whom to vote for will be a decision left entirely to them.""

20,"Shut the City down at 7 pm, Mr Sangliana","BANGALORE: Brilliant. Wonderful. Three cheers. Police Commissioner H.T. Sangliana has made the biggest discovery in the annals of crime.

It goes by the Code Name `After Eleven''.

Probably inspired by the delicious After Eight.

But that would be digressing.

Sangliana it turns out took a leaf from a predecessor of some years ago.

The gentleman of the checked blazers was better identified as the IPS officer who carried the briefcases of his political bosses.

One day, with crime at its peak and no excuses left, he told the Home Minister (who has just given him a dressing down), ``sir, crime is increasing because of all those late night pubs and bars, especially live-band restaurants. There is an excise rule which states that liquor cannot be served in places where there is live entertainment, so we''ll use that provision to harass them.''''

``Agreed. Clamp down on such places,'''' said the mantri.

And checked blazer did just that.

Except that the murders, rapes, burglaries, dacoities continued.

So the IPSwallah came up with a new idea. ``Let''s shut down Bangalore at 11 pm.''''

Nobody protested, because Bangaloreans always seek the path of least resistance.

That''s when they realised that 11 pm meant that cops could barge into a family restaurant or a pub at 10.30 pm and ask the customers to `Get Out''.

Hoteliers began to protest and subsequent police commissioners ordered pubs and bars to close by 11-11.30 pm, but allowed non-liquor serving eateries and restaurants in such crowded areas as Shivajinagar and City Market to remain open into the wee hours of the morning.

Now Sangliana says, ``Everything shuts down at 11 pm.''''

Why?

Because some wet-behind-the-ears DCP from the boondocks decided a crackdown was in order.

Does he have statistics to back his contention that late night eateries are a haven for criminals?

Have there been a spate of murders and robberies in these areas after 11?

No.

So what gives him the right to close down the city?

Nothing.

This is simply the misuse of power.

This is kicking democratic conventions in the face.

This is a prelude to the midnight knock.

Bangalore is a cosmopolitan city that is just recovering from a recession. We don''t need Sangliana & Co to impose curfew at 11 pm.

We need the city to be kicking and alive late into the night to facilitate commerce as well as allow us to de-stress.

We don''t need knee-jerk reactions.

Sangliana should instead of wasting his time being chief guest at half a dozen functions every day, first put his own house in order.

Dozens of people have died in hit-and-run accidents in the last few months and the stupid traffic cops have been unable to trace a single culprit.

Crimes against women are on the rise and the jurisdictional policemen have botched up the chargesheets so bad, the culprits have got away scotfree.

Corruption is rife in every police station.

Over 90 per cent of the police force is on the take.

So what does Sangliana do? He draws attention away from the problems by creating a 11 pm deadline.

Tomorrow he might decide that 9 pm is a good tine to shut shop.

Maybe even 7 pm.

What are we, a bunch of bozos, that we let the cops ride roughshod over us?

21,All incoming mobile calls may be free,"NEW DELHI: Mobile-to-mobile incoming calls across networks countrywide may soon be free, although users may have to pay a nominal monthly charge for the facility.

Cellular industry officials have already informed the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) of their plans to charge additional fixed cost â€” expected to be around Rs 100 â€” from subscribers and make incoming calls free for all mobile-to-mobile callers.

So far, only AirTel and Hutch have announced that within a few days, all their subscribers across India would have free incoming calls. Soon, the benefit is expected to be implemented industry-wide. The additional cost, which could be added to rentals, will be â€˜â€˜only a partial recoveryâ€™â€™ by mobile operators to pay call-terminating charges. The revenue-share formula among operators will cover mobile wireless in local loop (WLL-M) services as well.

Broadly, the mobile industryâ€™s plan is to minimise the tariff gap with landline phones and build a huge subscriber base soon. â€˜â€˜I believe that eventually airtime rates will be Re 1-1.25 a minute, while landline users will pay about Re 1.20 for two minutes or less instead of the prevailing three minutes,â€™â€™ said Escotel CEO Manoj Kohli. â€˜â€˜There will be a definite shift towards mobility,â€™â€™ he added.

Over the past few days, mobile operators have announced a series of rate cuts because of increasing competition within the mobile industry. Besides, they want to lure as many customers as possible before basic phone companies like Tata and Reliance launch WLL-M services, which have free incoming calls and charge Re 1.20 for a three-minute call. Nation-wide, average mobile tariff is Rs 2 per minute for airtime (about Re 1.50 in many states), and Rs 295 as rental. The TRAI ceiling is much higher at Rs 4.65/minute for airtime and Rs 422 for rental.

Hutchâ€™s Delhi CEO Sudershan Banerjee sees tariff cuts as an effort to find a balance between a decent average revenue per user and subscriber growth. â€˜â€˜We are trying to remove, one by one all barriers to mobility like incoming calls and roaming charges,â€™â€™ said Banerjee.

â€˜â€˜The way out is to expand the mobile subscriber base and have pan-India presence,â€™â€™ said Sarvjit Dhillon, AirTel CEO. â€˜â€˜Within the next 12 months, weâ€™ll have mobile phones overtaking landlines in Delhi.â€™â€™
