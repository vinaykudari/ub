0,Love and hate in chief minister’s constituency,"lambi (muktsar): it surely has been a ""vip"" constituency with distinction. for five years, chief minister prakash singh badal pampered it with generous doles. and now with assembly elections at hand, the election commission is all attention to it giving it a vip treatment, after it ""punished"" six officials for allegedly helping the cm and later announced that the state police deployed here will be replaced by para-military personnel. yet, in the cmâ€™s constituency, people either love him or hate him. after five years in power, those who have benefited from badalâ€™s preferential treatment are obviously singing peans of praise for the cm while the rest are sulking silently. if people talk favourably about impressive roads, imposing buildings of a school, a college and a 60-bed hospital, they also talk about corruption and police excesses carried out in the constituency to settle political scores. ""there have been incidents when political opponents were asked not to dare enter the police station or they would be thrashed for complaining,"" said jagpal singh, a shopkeeper. the cm nonetheless seems comfortably placed, inspite of the twin challenge that he faces from his cousin, mahesh inder singh badal, who is contesting as a congress rebel, and congress nominee gurnam singh abulkhurana. badal had trounced abulkhurana in 1997 by a convincing margin of over 28,000 votes. mahesh inder, considered close to senior congress leader jagmeet brar, is expected to cut both into the congress and the akali votes. the cm, however, seems to be treating this as a no-challenge situation as reflected by the fact that except for his brief stay when he filed his nomination papers, he has hardly been home, busy as he is canvassing for his partyâ€™s candidates in the rest of the state. in his absence, his wife, surinder kaur, is holding fort. she, along with sporadic visits of ""kakaji"", as badalâ€™s son, sukhbir, is addressed here, has been campaigning for ""sardarji"" in the constituency. talking to times news network, she said she visited five to six villages daily. ""i donâ€™t have any particular message for our voters, for whatever sardarji has done for the constituency is there for all to see,"" she said proudly. but she regretted that inspite of all this, the voters still expected somebody or the other from the badal family to come to them and ask for their votes. ""people say that unless some family member comes to them, they may not vote for us,"" she says. it is for this reason the badalâ€™s elder brother, gurdas singh, has lent his assistance. asked why mahesh inder singh, son of the cmâ€™s political mentor, teja singh, had decided to contest against him, surinder kaur dismissed it as the ""wayward political ambition"" of the next-door cousin. ""after seeing badal sahib acquire such heights, he also seems to have become ambitious,"" she said.

2,Punjab govt files review petition on SYL,"chandigarh: in its bid to somehow extract itself from the rather difficult position in which it got placed following the recent judgment of the supreme court, directing it to complete the satluj yamuna link (syl) canal in its territory and to make it functional within one year, the punjab government, on friday, finally filed a review petition in the apex court. the 33-page review petition preferred by the state under article 137 of the constitution read with 1966 apex court rules, has also sought a stay on the execution of the january 15, 2002 judgment of the court containing directions on syl completion. the judgment had been pronounced by the bench comprising of justices gb patnaik and ruma pal on the suit filed by haryana, seeking early completion of the canal. the syl is to carry 3.5 maf of haryanaâ€™s share of the ravi-beas waters as per the award of the eradi tribunal. however, punjabâ€™s contention is that eradi tribunal has not made the final award and that it is yet to determine the respective shares of punjab and haryana. it is on this premises that punjab has sought a review of the apex courtâ€™s judgment of january 15, 2002, arguing that the court erred in not treating an admitted water dispute as a water dispute. it also pointed out that there was no legal basis to haryanaâ€™s claim to the ravi-beas waters. the broad issues on which the review plea is based include the issue of not treating an admitted water dispute as a water dispute, lack of legal basis to haryana claim, provisions of article 131 were not attracted, construction not possible or cost effective, courtâ€™s role in public expenditure, failure to appreciate the equities in favour of punjab while noting assertions in favour of haryana, nine lakh acres to go dry and dislocate punjab farming, and the unjustified strictures passed against punjab in the supreme court judgment of january 15. punjab has also challenged the jurisdiction of the apex court in this respect and pointed out that the original jurisdiction of this court and all courts with respect to use, distribution or control of the waters in any inter-state river or river valley was barred by virtue of section 11 of the inter-state water disputes act read with article 262 of the constitution. it has further submitted that in the present case the state of haryana had raised a water dispute and by adjudicating upon the said dispute, the supreme court had assumed the jurisdiction upon itself which was not conferred by the constitution. also, it is evident from the pleadings of the haryana that the issue of canal was linked to its alleged share in ravi-beas waters. quoting extensively from the judgment itself to pin-point contradictions, punjabâ€™s petition submitted that the supreme court had wrongly assumed that haryanaâ€™s share had been determined. while the court also accepted that the question of quantum of the share was pending and referred to punjabâ€™s pending application before the tribunal. referring to the haryana suit on which the judgment was delivered by the apex court, the petition pointed out that haryana indirectly tried to achieve objectives like confirmation of quantum of entitlement of 3.5 maf plus, have the canal built for purpose of distributing this 3.5 maf, render the proceedings before the eradi tribunal redundant, to send a clear signal to punjab and its farmers that their livelihood was in peril, enforce and monitor the building of this canal irrespective of civil, military and insurrectionary consequences and, finally, to do what 35 years of negotiations had not achieved. punjab also wants the strictures passed against it by the supreme court to be deleted.

3,Fear of violence on D-day looms large,"moga:innuendoes, ugly rhetoric and abusive language have replaced the semblance of issuebased politics in this semi-urban constituency. education minister and sad (b)-bjp candidate tota singh, and vijay sathi of the congress are trying to run each other down, not hesitating to hit below the belt. the two leaders have been accusing each other of being close to smugglers, whose names they have openly been announcing from the stage. if sathi has accused the sad (b) leader of having a partnership in poppy husk and opium business in the area, tota singh has also been maligning the congress candidate. besides indulging in character assassination, the leaders of the two parties are raising issues like corruption and â€˜â€˜excessesâ€� committed by the police. with both the candidates spewing venom on each other, voters fear violence on the day of election. and their apprehensions are not unfounded.while supporters of vijay sathi have charged the akalis with calling a group of youths from outside the area to rig the polls and terrorise voters,tota singh has also made similar allegations. however, district police chief sharad satya chauhan has left nothing to chance. he says that 10 companies of para-military forces, having 100 personnel each, will be deployed in the district on the polling day. but he denies having received a complaint on the assembling of goons in the town. the fear of violence on the day of election also looms large on the neighbouring bagha purana constituency, from where candidates from the sad (b) and the congress are involved in a close fight. the police chief says that he had received complaints about apprehension of violence from congress candidate from bagha purana, mahesh inder singh.

4,"State election officials to EC: Sorry, we can’t do it!","chandigarh: the punjab election authorities have informed the election commission (ec) about their inability to implement its directive on ensuring that polling personnel from a particular district were not posted there for election duty. they also seem to be showing selectivity in taking action against officials of the state government who have complaints of election related offences against them. â€˜â€˜the presiding officers have dispersed after receiving training and it will be very difficult to serve such orders on them, and in any case it will take very long to implement such orders,â€™â€™ additional chief electoral officer (ceo) usha sharma told reporters here, on friday. the ec had issued three directives to punjab ceo, on thursday, and two of these had to be either abandoned or watered down. the ec had ordered the authorities to ensure that no official from a department was posted to a constituency from where the minister of the concerned department was a candidate. â€˜â€˜this order cannot be implemented in case of the education minister as most of the presiding officers are either school teachers or education department officials,â€™â€™ sharma said. this problem is, however, not only linked to the education department but also involves agriculture and other departments from where a large number of presiding officers are drawn and whose ministers are contesting the elections. in another development, the additional ceo parried questions on the status of bharat inder singh chahal, joint director in the information and public relations department. when asked why the election authorities in the state did not intercede in chahalâ€™s case when they had taken action against senior officers like deputy commissioners and senior superintendents of police, sharma mumbled,â€˜â€˜we cannot take action against senior officers directly.â€™â€™ chahal has been given time till friday to give a reply to the charges levelled against him. he has also seen the cassette in which he is seen to participate in a election-related meeting of ppcc president amarinder singh in moti bagh palace, patiala. â€˜â€˜we are waiting for the chief secretaryâ€™s report in the matter and there is no time-frame for receiving that report,â€™â€™ sharma said. the authorities have taken action against two bdos.

12,Pak not sincere in stopping terrorism: PM,"meerut: prime minister vajpayee on saturday made it clear that pakistan would have to decide if it wanted friendship or enmity with india. if pakistan did not stop cross-border terrorism, india would be left with option but to give a fitting response.

addressing a rally here, he reiterated that pakistan had so far not been sincere in stopping cross-border terrorism. in this connection, he referred to his lahore visit and the kargil conflict and said when he had taken the initiative to encourage friendship between the two countries, pakistan stabbed him in the back.

the pm pointed out that pakistani president gen pervez musharraf was repeatedly telling us and other countries that while pakistan was sincere in holding a dialogue with india, the indian government was not in favour of any negotiation on the kashmir issue. musharraf might repeat the same thing during his coming visit to the us. ``but we are not ready for a dialogue with pakistan unless it stops cross-border terrorism,'''' he said.

vajpayee also exhorted the people to be united in the fight against terrorism which, he said, was the only enemy of every indian. he said religion had nothing to do with terrorism.

he stressed the need for improving the law and order situation in up and said its deterioration had created a stumbling block in the overall development of the state.

he said the centre''s recent decision to lift restrictions on the movement of agricultural produce and foodgrains from one state of another would help farmers get a better deal.

he also accused the congress of trying to engineer defections from the akali-bjp alliance in punjab and said the alliance aimed at strengthening hindu-sikh unity in punjab.

the pm was accompanied by union agriculture minister ajit singh and chief minister rajnath singh.

20,Principal asked to take lenient view on attendance,"new delhi: the delhi high court has directed the principal of shyama prasad mukherjee college to admit the students who could not attend classes while fighting a case against the college. while conceding that the college principal was within his rights not to allow the students to take their exams last year on account of short attendance, justice s k mahajan observed they should not be penalised for the second time again by disallowing them to resume classes for the session 2001-2002 as they have been fighting the case. the court, while not interfering with the principalâ€™s order, asked the students to make a fresh representation and observed that the principal could take a sympathetic view. the students again approached the principal with medical certificates, but their representation was rejected. the students again approached the court, alleging that the principal had been vindictive because they had approached the court. pleading for allowing the students to sit for the exams this year, their lawyer, r k saini, told the court that in the process of shuttling between college and the court, one year has already been lost. observing that the principal was within powers to reject the representation propped by dubious medical certificates, the judge said: â€˜â€˜this is not the end of the matter. the petitioners have already lost one year... they may lose another precious year. since they were fighting the court case, in my view they should not be penalised again.â€™â€™ the court ordered that even though the last date of admission had expired, they should be admitted and attendance may be counted from the day of admission. the principal had taken the stand that the attendance criteria has to be enforced, failing which it was encouraging indiscipline among students and leading to a fall in academic standards. agreeing with the principal on this point, the court pulled up the students for their lackadaisical attitude and said they are expected to go to college regularly and on time, to work at about the same speed as their classmates and to pass tests to show how well they have progressed.
