0,Medical code submitted to govt,"hyderabad:in a development that is likely to usher in changes in the medical segment, renowned health consultant g kumaraswamy reddy submitted his recommendations on the modalities for implementation of a new comprehensive medical code in the state. reddy, former principal secretary of the health department with a hands-on experience of over eight years in the field, was appointed by the government to revise the existing code which had not been updated for long time. though some changes were made during the past few years, they could not serve the purpose in the light of the large-scale changes the field underwent from time to time. in the developments in the field of medical science and knowledge of health science, the metamorphosis has been mind boggling. a medical code cannot, therefore, remain oblivious to all the dynamic change and has to take all the change in its fold, reddy said in a note submitted to the government. the present code is a substantive examination of the existing code aimed at removing obsolescence introducing latest knowledge and development in the field , the note said.

1,‘Every party needs our support’,"hyderabad: despite facing a rout in 1999 assembly elections, the majlis bachau tehreek (mbt) has maintained its political base in the old city, especially in the chandrayangutta and yakutpura assembly constituencies. the forthcoming municipal elections will be a do-or-die battle for mbt president mohd amanullah khan who had lost the assembly elections in 1999 after representing the chandrayangutta constituency uninterruptedly for 22 years. in an interview to the times of india, he spoke about his party's readiness for the mch elections. how important are the forthcoming municipal elections for your party? we have been waiting for the municipal elections for a quite long time.this is an opportunity for us to prove that the mbt is not dead as being propagated by the mim. it will be a do-or-die battle for the mbt and it will emerge victorious. no party will be able to form the next council without our support. what is your party's strategy for the baldia elections? we will field candidates for almost all the wards including for the mayor's post. we launched our campaign about three months ago. group meetings and public meetings have been held in most of the wards in the yakutpura, chandrayangutta, charminar, karwan and malakpet assembly constituencies and we got a tremendous response from the people. will you have any tie-up with other parties? as the mbt favours formation of telangana state, we may have a tie-up with parties supporting the telangana cause. but it is for sure that we will not have any kind of tie-up or understanding with the tdp,bjp, congress or tss. any tie-up with the trs possible? though it is not ruled out, there has been no communication on the issue from both sides.we may discuss the issue if someone approaches us. what will be your manifesto for the municipal elections? we will ensure that all civic problems in the old city are solved within a short span through proper representations to the government. we will be able to change the entire outlook of the old city if we win a majority of seats in this region. since your party lost both the assembly seats, it is considered weak. how far it is true? it is a false propaganda being peddled by the mim.we lost the assembly elections because of the huge money spent by the mim and not due to people's rejection. during the last two years, people have themselves seen the difference between my leadership and owaisis' and are repenting the 'mistake' they have committed. this time they will undo the 'mistake' by voting for the mbt.
