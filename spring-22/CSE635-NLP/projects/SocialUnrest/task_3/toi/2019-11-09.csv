0,State govt finally approves purchase of Dabhol power,"MUMBAI: In an effort to tide over the acute energy crisis in Maharashtra, the state cabinet on Thursday cleared decks for power purchase from the idle Dabhol Power Companyâ€™s (DPC) 658 MW phase one for Rs 2.80 per unit.

According to recommendations of the expert committee on energy set up under the chairmanship of chief secretary Ajit Nimbalkar, the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) will buy DPC power at 83 per cent plant load factor with a pass-through componentâ€� on the naphtha prices, an official release said here.

The Nimbalkar committee has suggested the government inform the Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI) led lenders of DPC on their decision to procure power. â€œThe IDBI should also be requested to restart generation of phase one at the earliest with the Union power ministryâ€™s help,â€� it said.

Chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh did not address the regular post cabinet meeting press conference as he left for Mount Abu to attend a Congress CMsâ€™ conclave.

Last month, the high-powered co-ordination committee of the ruling Democratic Front government had approved purchase of DPC power at the stipulated rate on an â€œas and whenâ€� basis for a year.

Sources said the MSEB would now approach the state regulatory commission for approval of Rs 2.80 per unit rate.

This decision comes after several months of resistance from the state government to buy power from the DPC. Earlier, it had approved a rate of Rs 2.25 per unit, which was promptly rejected by IDBI, stating that it was too low.

1,SAD (B) leaders go into hiding to evade arrest,"BATHINDA: Quite a few senior Shiromani Akali Dal (Badal) (SAD-B) leaders here went underground, on Friday, to avoid being picked up or detained by the police.

The district police authorities denied the charges of intimidating or picking up SAD members. However, Manpreet Singh Badal, who is the SAD(B) media incharge, told TNN over the telephone that party leaders had gone into hiding as the police had started threatening and raiding their houses.

Despite repeated attempts, TNN was unable to get in touch with Chiranjee Lal Garg, Gura Singh Tungwali, Sikander Singh Malooka, Om Parkash Sharma and other senior party leaders. Reports say that all of the party leaders have gone into hiding on the direction of the party high command issued on Friday afternoon.

Manpreet Singh Badal alleged that the only motive of the Congress government was to some how stop SAD leaders and workers from reaching Amritsar so that they could rig the SGPC elections for the Tohra-Ravi Inder group.

Manpreet added that the Congress had resorted to intimidation as all other efforts to lure SAD(B) members had failed. Nonetheless, he claimed that the SAD(B) would emerge victorious in the election. In another significant development, Harcharan Singh Gill, SGPC member from Bathinda, who is suffering from blood cancer and has been bed-ridden for the past few months, also went into hiding.

Sources said that Gill was taken to Chandigarh by a senior SAD(B) leader, on Friday morning, since the Tohra faction was expected to pressurise Gill into joining hands with him.

Gill is known to be close to Badal but is expected to return Tohra a favour. Tohra had reportedly assisted Gill in securing admission for his daughter in the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee-owned medical college. Bathinda police reportedly rounded up sarpanches of Mehma, Lehra Mohabbat and Lehra Khana villages on Friday evening.

The sarpanches are staunch supporters of SAD(B) chief Parkash Singh Badal. Senior SAD(B) leader Tajinder Singh Middukhera alleged that the police teams raided the houses of Kotkapura and Faridkot SAD(B) MLAs Mantar Singh and Kushaldeep Singh Dhillon, but the leaders managed to get away. District police chief Harinder Singh Chahal denied allegations that MLAsâ€™ houses had been raided but admitted to rounding up some Akalis.

2,Ajit opposed to I-T on farmers,"LUCKNOW: Union Agriculture minister and RLD leader Chaudhry Ajit Singh on Friday said that his party was opposed to the move of the finance ministry for bringing farmers under the purview of income tax.

Talking to mediapersons here, he said the move was not in the larger interest of the farmers, who were already hard-pressed for their economy. And their problem would increase manifold, if they were brought under the IT purview, he said.

They had been denied the incentives they deserved and for this purpose, he said, he had proposed to devise a ways-and-means policy to get them loan at easy interest rate currently was relatively higher compared to that of other industries. He said he had decided to hold a meeting with the RBI, the NABARD and various other financial institutions in order to evolve a mechanism by which the interest rate could be reduced for farmers.

With regard to the cooperative movement, he said, UP had the cooperative department but lacked in true cooperative spirit. He said the Centre had passed a model cooperative law and now the state was also expected to act on this in order to popularise the cooperative movement.

Expressing concern over the non-starting of the sugar mills in the state, he said he had discussions on the issue with chief minister Mayawati and cane minister Premlata Katiyar. Both of them had assured him of taking some concrete steps towards this end, he added.

He said sugar mills should immediately resume crushing so that farmers did not suffer and got the price of their produce. He said it would create a very bad precedent if the sugar mill owners tried to exploit farmers this way and warned that the situation would aggravate if farmers refused to produce cane in future.

3,"Social, political bodies volunteer to help Chhath devotees","PATNA: In order to facilitate hassle-free Chhath celebrations, in addition to ensuring its gaiety and fervour, several social organisations and political parties have come forward to provide necessary help to the people.

4,ABVP rallyists to pay train fare,"PATNA: Bihar unit of Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) will organise a â€œShiksha Parivartan Rath Yatraâ€� from November 14, which will ultimately be merged into ABVPâ€™s national rally in New Delhi on November 26. The rally will be organised on the occasion of the birth centenary of Loknayak Jayaprakash Narayan, ABVP regional secretary Shivnarayan Prasad said at a press conference here on Friday. The main attraction of the rally, in which about 5,000 students are expected to participate, is that all the partici-pating students will visit Delhi by paying train fare.

â€œThat is why we have decided to take limited number of students,â€� Prasad said. Gopal Sharma, state secretary, said that half of the fare would be given by the participant themselves while the half of the amount would be arranged by ABVP through donations. â€œHence our rally is totally different from others and we have linked our struggle to morality,â€� he added.

The ABVP state secretary said that â€œrath yatraâ€� would start from JP residence at Kadamkuan and would pass through Jehanabad, Ara, Buxar and different districts of Utter Pradesh. He said the aim of the rath yatra is to highlight the fault in our education system and make people aware. â€œOur demand is to abolish the present education system and to introduce the new â€œIndo-centric Education Systemâ€� throughout the country,â€� he added. As many as one lakh students from all the states as well Union territories of the country are expected to participate in the rally. They will be issued the identity cards on the occasion.

5,Bailed PWG prisoner rearrested,"KOLKATA: In the first incident of its kind since chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee announced that the Naxalite prisoners would be released in phases, one of them was rearrested on Friday from the jail gate. Babulal Ahir, a villager of Nischintapur in the Belpahari police station area, was arrested three months ago on charges of being a Peopleâ€™s War activist.

He got bail in all five cases against him. While he was coming out of Jhargram sub-jail around 5 pm with his son Tapan, lawyer Satyajit Sinha and Subrata Bhattacharya of the local Bandimukti Sahajya Committee, plainclothes policemen pounced upon him.

â€œThe action seemed straight out of a Hindi movie,â€� said Bhattacharya. Ahirâ€™s companions were allegedly man-handled during the arrest. No memo of arrest was given. Babulalâ€™s son later lodged a written complaint to the SDO Jhargram.

Jhargram PS officers confirmed that Babulal was in their custody, but pleaded that the orders came from above. Babulalâ€™s counsel Prasanta Roy said the arrest was illegal as per Supreme Court directives.

6,"MCC, PW launch campaign against Jharkhand govt","GAYA: In a significant development, arch rivals MCC and the CPI-ML (Peopleâ€™s War) have launched a joint campaign against the Jharkhand government. Through a joint statement, Sunil and Raman, secretaries of the joint state committee of Bihar and Jharkhand of the CPI-ML (Peopleâ€™s War) and Bihar-Jharkhand-Bengal Special Area Committee of the MCC respectively have given a call to the people of Jharkhand to give the state government a run for its money. A copy of the joint appeal was made available to the TNN in Gaya.

The appeal alleged that the Jharkhand police were committing atrocities on the poor and that they resorted to extortion and blackmail of the innocent people on the alibi of conducting anti-Naxalite operations. If the number of Pota detentions reveal anything, Jharkhand is more disturbed a state as compared to even Kashmir and the North-East as no less than 3,000 persons have been booked under Pota in the state, the statement said. The MCC and Peopleâ€™s War leaders also accused the Jharkhand police of committing massacres in Semari (Garhwa), Piparkhand and Marnaghati (Palamu). With this appeal, the joint MCC-PW operation has become a dreadful possibility.

The two Naxalite organisations have, for more than a decade, been involved in a bloody turf war in the Palamu area of Jharkhand and Aurangabad-Jehanabad region of Bihar. The joint statement also questioned the motive of the Jharkhand government in road construction activity in the state. The MCC and the Peopleâ€™s War leaders alleged that roads were being constructed in Jharkhand to crush what they called the revolutionary struggle in the region and also to mint money in the name of development. Raising the issue of greater Jharkhand, which includes the tribal districts of Orissa, West Bengal and Chattisgarh, the Naxalite leaders alleged that a fraud has been committed on the tribal population who have been virtually handed over a toy â€œjhunjhunnaâ€� in the name of Jharkhand. The MCC and Peopleâ€™s War leaders also alleged that the communal forces were trying to create ill-will between the Hindu and Christian tribals.

Explaining its shattered dream theory on Jharkhand, the MCC-PW joint statement said that no appointments, except a few in the state police department, have been made in the state during the last two years. The ongoing closure of mines and factories, too, have rendered thousands of unorganised workers jobless. In order to conceal its own shortcomings, the Babulal Marandi government has fuelled the domicile fire which was dangerous for the stateâ€™s polity as well as economy.

7,BJP medical cell secy quits party,"ARA: State secretary of the Bharatiya Janata Partyâ€™s state medical cell Dr B K Singh has resigned from the primary membership of the party in protest against the â€œautocratic behaviour and internal bickerings in the party at both the state and the Central levelsâ€�. Speaking to TNN, Singh said that it had become very difficult for him to continue in the party in the wake of the Central governmentâ€™s â€œanti-people policiesâ€�, particularly the budget.

He maintained that the intellectual class, including the medical fraternity, had not been spared. â€œThe government enacted a law that adversely affected the interests of the medical fraternity,â€� he said. Singh also attributed the removal of former Union minister C P Thakur from the Union ministry to the ongoing internal feud in the BJP. â€œIt is really shocking that there was no representation of medical fraternity in the Union cabinet after Thakurâ€™s removal,â€� Singh said.

â€œThe state president of the partyâ€™s medical cell, Dr S N Arya, was humiliated by the partyâ€™s state president at the recent executive meeting. It was a direct insult to the doctors,â€� he alleged. Singh further said: â€œRecently, former president of IMA Dr Ajay Kumar, an executive member of the MCI, was targeted by the Union health ministry because of his close rapport with former Union health minister C P Thakur.â€�

8,Security cover of ex-ministers withdrawn,"HYDERABAD: The city police have decided to review posting of armed guards at the residences of the VIPs and senior police officials due to acute shortage of manpower. The police top brass last week rejected a request from tourism minister T Srinivas Yadav to provide an armed escort team and withdrew the security guards posted at the residences of former ministers C Krishna Yadav, S Aruna, A Rajendra Prasad, J Lakshmi Padmavathi and K Pushapaleela. The police also removed the security cover to former Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader P Janardhan Reddy and NTR-TDP president N Lakshmi Parvathi.

It is being proposed to either withdraw or scale down the security cover to some more politicians. The police officials are also examining the threat perception to mayor T Krishna Reddy, who is provided an escort vehicle with additional five security guards, besides two personal security officers. The officials reportedly expressed inability to provide four constables and a SI to assist the newly-appointed Human Rights Committee headed by Justice Bhaskar Rao.

According to police sources, a total of 469 personnel are guarding the residences of ministers, judges, senior police officials and other VIPs in the city. â€œIf we could take out at least half of the guards, they can supplement the bandobust requirements in the city,â€� the sources pointed out. It is becoming increasingly difficult for the city police to provide manpower for bandobust duties. It is being planned to withdraw guards at the residences of over half-a-dozen senior IPS officers after analysing threat to their lives. Meanwhile, pressed with acute shortage of manpower on Friday, police commissioner M V Krishna Rao withdrew his own escort vehicle and deployed the five guards accompanying him for bandobust duties.

9,Police fear disruption of SGPC polls,"AMRITSAR: The police here is apprehensive of selective terrorist strikes during the ensuing Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committees (SGPC) executive body elections slated for November 12. Though the police has not received any concrete input of terror attack by any particular group but going by their past experience they perceive a possibility of disruption of polls.

Inspector general, border range, Rajan Gupta, while talking to Times News Network, on Saturday, said that terrorism was one among the other factors where police was concentrating and taking all possible preventive measures. He said that special nakas had been laid at all the entry points of city. Gupta said that the police was taken by surprise to find that various split factions of Akalis contesting elections were exhorting their supporters to reach the election venue in huge numbers, which was unprecedented in the SGPCâ€™s office-bearers elections. The detainment of about 300 Akali workers having affiliation with different Akali factions, as claimed by Gupta, was a preventive action.

He said that the police wonâ€™t stop anyone from entering the Golden Temple, which is only about 100 yards from the election venue, to pay obeisance. Regarding the entry of nihangs, who usually carry traditional weapons, into the SGPC complex, Gupta said that the officer on duty would assess the intentions of the person before allowing him to enter the complex and further it would be the duty of SGPCâ€™s task force whether to allow the person or not. He also said that no senior police official would be present in plain clothes in the SGPC complex and they would intervene only on the request of the SGPC authorities.

10,Experts caution govt on DPC power deal,"PUNE: Energy experts have urged the state government to exercise caution while going ahead with its plan to buy 83 per cent power from the first phase of Dabhol Power Corporation (DPC).

Experts have pointed out that several crucial problems and issues pertaining to DPC remain unresolved, which could lead to serious implications in the future.

""Although restarting of the first phase of DPC is essential, several questions need to be answered first,"" said former MSEB chairman Madhav Godbole, who has earlier exposed deliberate cost inflation and overcharging by Enron in the DPC project.

""Will the old power purchase agreement (PPA) remain valid while buying DPC power? If yes, it will create serious financial problems for the MSEB,"" he pointed out.

""It is not clear whether the changing price of Naptha will have any effect on the price of DPC power and whether the government has worked out any escalation formula. I feel these aspects need to be studied carefully since the decision will have long-term financial implications,"" Godbole remarked.

The city-based Prayas group, which has been methodically analysing state and Central power projects and policies, feels the state is rushing in to buy DPC power. ""It is not just a question of buying power,"" says Shantanu Dixit of Prayas.

""Enron appointed four directors on DPC board on Thursday and therefore enjoys a majority there. The threat of Enron going in for arbitration is very real and we hope the government has taken this into account before taking the decision,"" he said.

Also, there is the pending issue of DPC''s liquidation, he said. Girish Sant, also of Prayas, feels that if the change in Naptha prices was not going to affect the unreasonably low rate of Rs 2.80 per unit of DPC power as reported in the press, the government needs to clarify how it will absorb the additional cost when Naptha becomes costlier.

Sant also wondered why the government waited for so long before deciding to explore the possibility of importing coal for MSEB''s thermal power stations.

11,"BJP, JD join hands to campaign against govt","BANGALORE: In a rare show of unity, the BJP and both Janata Dal factions in Karnataka on Saturday came together to announce a ''concerted campaign'' against the State government for its purported ''indifferent'' attitude towards kidnapped former minister H. Nagappa.

After a 90-minute meeting convened by Legislative Assembly opposition leader Jagadish Shettar, they urged the government to send Agro-Processing Minister G. Raju Gowda as emissary to negotiate with forest brigand Veerappan. Though the JD (S) did not attend the meeting, Shettar told reporters that he had spoken to its State unit president Siddaramaiah, who had extended support to the issue.

""Our main interest is Nagappa''s release, but the government seems indifferent to his plight. It is disturbing that the same government which made all out efforts during the Rajkumar kidnap episode, appears callous this time,"" Shettar added.

The State government rejected Veerappan''s demand in his fourth cassette, received on November 3, to send Gowda as the emissary.

Shettar said the meeting had arrived at a definite plan of action for the campaign. ""We want Chief Minister Krishna to immediately meet his Tamil Nadu counterpart J. Jayalalithaa and discuss how the problem can be solved,"" he added.

The plan of action also includes urging Union Home Minister L.K. Advani to take the initiative and arrange for the two CMs to meet; a day-long dharna on Tuesday to sensitise the government and create awareness among the people about the government''s attitude; and broadbase the platform to include pro-Kannada organisations and farmers'' outfits among others on Wednesday.

State JD (U) president C. Byre Gowda also demanded that Gowda resign from his posts of minister and legislator in order to negotiate with the brigand as demanded by him in the cassette. ""We promise to get him unanimously elected after he manages to get Nagappa released,"" he declared.

BJP president Basavaraj Patil Sedam, leaders B.S. Yediyurappa, Mukhyamantri Chandru, S. Suresh Kumar, JD (U) floor leader in the Assembly P.G.R. Sindhia, B. Somashekar, B.N. Bache Gowda, Ramesh Kumar, K. Jayaprakash Hegde (all legislators) were also present.

12,Ambernath bandh total,"THANE: The Ambernath and Ulhasnagar bandh called by the Republican Party of India (RPI) on Saturday was total.

The bandh was called to protest against the murder on Friday of party leader Naresh Gaikwad.

Thousands of RPI leaders and workers gathered at Ambernath for Mr Gaikwad''s funeral.

Prominent among them were Ramdas Athavale and deputy speaker of the legislative council Vasant Davkhare.

Mr Athavale told reporters that the murder was politically motivated because Mr Gaikwad had vociferously demanded a probe into corruption cases in the Ambernath municipal council.

Mr Athavale said that the state government should initiate a CID inquiry into the killing.

Meanwhile, the police have arrested three persons in connection with the killing.

13,DF govt keeps corporate czars at bay,"MUMBAI: A clash of civilisations, or so it would seem. The Congress-led state government has zealously guarded its sovereignty vis-a-vis the private sector in crucial areas of development such as power, road, ports, irrigation and tourism.

The newly-constituted infrastructure authority, which will be formally inaugurated at a function in Mumbai on Sunday, has been packed with ministers and bureaucrats, it is learnt.

Chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh and his four senior cabinet collea-gues will control the authority''s decision-making wing, while chief secretary Ajit Nimbalkar and four key bureaucrats will man the technical side.

This leaves scarcely any scope for captains of industry to influence the state''s infrastructure policy and programmes.

The Democratic Front government''s move assumes significance in view of the pressure mounting on Mr Deshmukh to give up the politics of largesse and cut red-tapism in a bid to put the beleaguered state back on the superhighway of industrial advancement, political observers say.

During four-month-long discussions with the Vilasrao Deshmukh government, the Maharashtra economic development council (MEDC), a think-tank on financial issues that floated the idea of a separate infrastructure authority, made a fervent appeal on behalf of the private sector.

""The MEDC is of the view that the private sector should be pro-active in preparing a roadmap for Maharashtra''s development. This, we thought, would signal a unique partnership between the political and professional leadership. However, the Maharashtra government turned down our suggestion,"" said MEDC chief Murlidhar Chaini, vice-president (corporate affairs), Reliance Industries.

The MEDC''s original idea was to constitute an autonomous, state-level corporation that would function as a single-point authority to prioritise projects of development. In anticipation of getting the state''s approval, the MEDC even sounded out L&T, Mahindra and Mahindra, Tata Power, Gammon India, Hindustan Construction and Feedback Ventures.

""But the state government developed cold feet. This despite our assurance that the final decision in matters of awarding contracts was going to rest with Mantralaya and that the participation of the private sector was chiefly to guarantee professional expertise,"" said Mr Chaini.

The DF government was worried about the political implications of the MEDC''s proposal.

Mr Deshmukh & Co do not relish the idea of being popularly perceived as a band of weak politicians who have cosied up to the private sector.

Secondly, permitting the private sector to wrest the initiative in matters of development could mean upsetting left allies such as the Janata Dal and the CPM, which could be a high-voltage political risk.

A key DF minister, who spoke with this newspaper on Saturday, said, ""The private sector is seen as the votary of fast-track development. But we can''t forget that development has to have a human face.""
