1,"Journalist arrested; ex-model, two others absconding","JALANDHAR: While a journalist from a Chandigarh-based newspaper was arrested and given two-daysâ€™ police remand three others, including a former model, a stringer with another vernacular publication and their mother were found absconding in a human trafficking and â€˜kabbotarbaziâ€™ racket in which they were booked by the Jalandhar police on Saturday.

2,Maghi Mela rally: A test for Jagmeet Brar,"BATHINDA: Jagmeet Singh Brar, Parliament member from Faridkot, has taken up the task of bringing truce in the troubled Punjab Congress Committee by getting leaders of the two groups together at a party stage at Muktsar on January 13, for participating in the historic Maghi Mela.

He is also leaving no stone unturned to make the political conference of the party here on January 13 a grand success, for, he is himself in a mood to contest the forthcoming Lok Sabha elections from this parliamentary constituency.

Earlier Jagmeet had expressed his desire of not fighting the parliamentary elections and said that he was interested in fighting the next assembly elections against former Punjab chief minister Parkash Singh Badal. While setting aside all speculation about his contesting Lok Sabha elections, Jagmeet had sought to clarify this week that he would contest the forthcoming elections from Faridkot, if the party high command does not desire otherwise.

On the other hand, Jagmeet says that he would contact every party legislator personally and visit them to seek their presence at the party conference at Maghi Mela on January 13 at Muktsar. Jagmeet is thus busy these days in making the Maghi Mela conference in his home town a big success.

On the one hand, it would give a boost to his image in this parliamentary constituency, consisting of Faridkot, Moga and Muktsar districts, on the other hand, he also want to win accolades for bringing the warring factions of the Congress on to one stage. On Monday, Jagmeet Brar would be in Muktsar to allocate duties to his supporters and workers to put an impressive show of strength at the conference.

He also plans to sound the bugle of his electioneering campaign at this conference. But the Congress leaders in this area are still skeptical about Jagmeet prevailing upon Rajinder Kaur Bhattal in bringing her to Muktsar on his own. Bhattal would attend Maghi Mela conference if she was directed by the party high command, otherwise her differences with Jagmeet Brar are an open secret. Only three months back, Jagmeet and Bhattal were accusing each other of causing harm to the interests of the party in the state.

Moreover, Jagmeetâ€™s closeness to Amarinder, which came about in August-September last, is also a cause for heartburn to Bhattal. Differences between Jagmeet and Amarinder were also a known factor till recently. He had buried the hatchet with Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh when some of his close aides were given important appointments in the state government four months back.

While Jagmeet has opened his cards by revealing his desire to contest from Faridkot, the Akalis are also expected to give an indication about the party candidate at the Maghi Mela. Faridkot has remained an important parliamentary seat for the Akalis and Congress as Sukhbir Singh Badal and Jagmeet Brar had contested the last two elections from this seat.

3,AIMTC protests against hike in fuel prices,"PUNE: The All-India Motor Transport Congress (AIMTC) has strongly protested against the recent hike in petrol and diesel prices and has demanded transparency in fixing fuel prices.

A statement released on Sunday by AIMTC president Baba Dhumal said the frequent hikes in fuel prices had put â€œtremendous burdenâ€� on the transport sector. â€œIn 1998, the expenditure on diesel constituted 40 per cent of the operating cost,which has now gone up to 71 p.c.,â€� Dhumal said.

He pointed out that there was no transparency in fixing prices of petroleum products. â€œPetroleum companies made a presentation before the AIMTC last year on the subject, but company representatives only talked about various taxes on petroleum products and ex-refinery prices. No information about the price at which crude oil was obtained was given,â€� he said.

Dhumal suggested that prices of petroleum products be revised every six months. â€œTransporters have long-term contracts with their customers and fortnightly revision in diesel prices affects the sector.â€� Meanwhile, the Alandi Consumer Organisation has also protested against the hike in fuel prices and demanded a roll-back.

4,Lokmanya panel leads in DE Society polls,"PUNE: The Lokmanya panel was leading in the elections to the governing council (GC) of the Deccan Education (DE) Society at 10 pm on Sunday after three rounds of counting.

The counting was likely to continue till late in the night and the results were likely to be declared at 2 am on Monday. As many as 4,045 votes were cast in the elections on Sunday, out of which 332 were found to be invalid. Till the third round, 1,875 votes had been counted.

The 120-year-old DE Society, established by the father of Indian unrest, Lokmanya Balgangadhar Tilak, runs a chain of educational institutes across Maharashtra. Some of the prominent colleges managed by the institute include the Fergusson college and the Brihan Maharashtra Commerce College (BMCC) in Pune, and the Kirti college in Mumbai.

This time around, 21 senior members, led by Padmakar Pardeshi, former vice-chairman of the GC, have launched a massive campaign to topple the present body, accusing it of â€œgross failureâ€� in promoting the institute at the national level, like the Bharati Vidyapeeth and Symbiosis.

On the other hand, the present body, led by chairman Vasantrao Kanitkar and vice-chairman Suryakant Pathak, refuted the allegations and lamented the act of the senior members for bringing â€œdisreputeâ€� to one of the oldest and most prestigious educational institutes in the country. Kanitkar and Pathak are contesting the elections for the 21-member GC under the aegis of the Lokmanya panel, while Pardeshi is leading the rebel Pragati Path panel.

5,Cable firms feeling the pinch,"HYDERABAD: The cable TV industry is in a state of disarray. Though sky channels have proliferated and cable TV penetration has increased over the years, profit margins for cable operators and multi-system operators (MSOs) have plummeted because major broadcasters shifted to the pay channel system in the late 1990s.

This meant that MSOs, who tap satellite signals and tune them in set frequencies, and ground-level cable operators, who provide connections to households in a given area, have to pay a certain amount to the broadcasters for receiving the signal.

This increased the connection fee per household to an exorbitant Rs 350 per month.

However, as most households cannot afford to pay such a huge amount, the operators and MSOs started sharing the burden among themselves to retain their customer base. This severely affected their business and margins plummeted.

â€œNot a single cable operator in the state is able to earn profits after the introduction of the pay-channel system. Those who have been in the field for a long time are able to survive because they have some reserves to fall back on. But the condition of new entrants is pitiable. Most people are continuing in the business as they have to at least get back the investments they have made on cables and amplifiers. Forget operators, even MSOs are facing financial problems. Other than Siti Cable no other MSO in the state has been able to break even,â€� says Siti Cable director S Y Srikumar.

To make matters worse, bitter turf wars between pay channels have landed the operators in an unenviable situation.

With a boom in the industry, pay channels and MSOs are fighting to expand their territory by enlisting more and more operators.

This is often done by introducing thugs and local strongmen to replace the older ones. This is leading to tens i o n s a m o n g t h e MSOs as also operators, s a y s Andhra Pradesh C a b l e Operators Welfare Association general secretary K Sreenivas Rao.

But the issue gets further complicated with several pay channels too joining the game.

Service providers offering a bouquet of channels at a certain price try to nurture and promote a few operators and MSOs at the cost of others, he says.

For example, in Vijayawada, recently about 300 cases of cable wires being cut by rival operators, planning to capture localities, have been reported. This was allegedly done at the behest of the MSOs owing allegiance to various channels.

The situation is similar in Visakhapatnam and several big towns of the state, he says. In Hyderabad, where there are about 800 operators, the competition is even more intense. Though there have been no major cases of violence barring last Sundayâ€™s incident, there is simmering trouble which could explode at any moment, he says.

The crux of the problem, according to Rao, is the lack of any regulatory mechanism in the country. The government has to issue licences to operators to ensure that there are not more than two or three of them in a given area. This will prevent channels and MSOs from pitting one operator against the other, he said.

In addition, the conditional access system (CAS) also has to be brought in as soon as possible with necessary changes, points Cable Operators Association general secretary Seva Singh.

â€œThe government must prevent channels from generating revenue through advertising, when they are also charging the customer for subscription. Even more important is to ensure that the customer can choose his channel and pay for only that. This will lead to the stabilisation of cable TV tariff so that the customer can afford it. Under the present system, channels are offering a bouquet of channels and the customer has to pay for all of them whether he likes it or not,â€� he adds.

AP Cable Operators Welfare Association president K Prabhakar Reddy says, â€œThere has to be a proper regulatory mechanism in place. The pay channels cannot be allowed to run away with all the bounty like this.â€�

6,No rules in PM's pet project,"NEW DELHI: The murder of IITian Satyendra Kumar Dubey, who was working on Prime Minister Vajpayeeâ€™s â€˜â€˜Golden Quadrilateralâ€™â€™ project, is not the only incident to have marred the project.

The biggest and the costliest ever project undertaken by the National Highway Authority of India and carried out by contractors is meant to streamline road ways across the country.

But, certain means chosen are suspect in the eyes of the law. The apex court has already castigated various authorities for failing to implement its orders.

The frequent breach of law has given rise to powerful vested interests and even court orders are not implemented, the SC noted.

Raising embankments and other construction works undertaken by the project violated the guidelines and directions notified by the Union government following the Delhi High Courtâ€™s judgment in a public interest litigation in 1999.

A drive of 400 km on the national highway is good enough to see that the Centreâ€™s notification had been defied.

The directive that 25 per cent of fly ash, produced by several coal and lignite based thermal plants, must be used in raising embankments and other construction activities has been flouted with impunity.

The top soil has been excavated from the riverâ€™s bed in complete disregard to the specification that â€˜â€˜clay/earth/soil shall not be lifted in continuous stretch. The borrow pits should be suitably staggeredâ€™â€™.

This violation has posed an imminent threat of floods, soil erosion and loss of forests area.

In fact, the notification bans excavation of land or sand from any river bed within 50 km of coal or lignite based thermal plants. This could be relaxed only if at least 25 per cent of freely available fly ash is used along with the unearthed material.

In another social interest litigation relating to public health, the apex court had asked the government to utilise massive amount of fly ash which otherwise is a serious health hazard causing respiratory and lung disease.

The notification thus seeks to kill two birds with one stoneâ€” utilisation of fly ash which is supplied by the power plants free of cost and minimising the danger of diseases.

The haphazard digging operations have added to the farmersâ€™ woes.

The Centre recently ordered an inquiry into complaints by a large number of farmers from Delhi and other states alleging that their land falling in the river bed had been unauthorisedly excavated by contractors for putting up embankments.

7,HP Cong geared up for LS polls,"SHIMLA: Himachal Pradesh Congress Committee spokesman Kuldeep Rathore on Monday said that though the state unit of the party was fully geared for the forthcoming Lok Sabha elections, even if they were preponed, incharge of Himachal affairs and national leader Ghulam Nabi Azad would be coming here on Jan 15 and 16 to form an action plan.

Talking to newspersons here, he said that Azad in consultation with chief minister Virbhadra Singh, HPCC chief Vidya Stokes and other senior leaders would formulate an action plan to be implemented in the state for the Lok Sabha elections.

The HPCC chief will also undertake a tour of the state to gear up the workers and other party functionaries, he added.

He said that the central observer for the state, Jai Krishan had also visited the state and completed his survey on Jan 12.

The report of his survey and observations during his stay would be made available shortly, he said.

Claiming that the confidence of the party workers and leaders was at a high because of the good work being done by the party government in the state, Rathore said that almost all the promises made in the party''s election manifesto for the last assembly elections were in the process of being fulfilled.

He said that while even the masses were appreciating the dood work being done by the Virbhadra government, they had yet not forgotten the five years of misrule, nepotism and corruption during the tenure of the previous BJP government in the state, and it was still fresh in their minds.

The party spokeaperson said that the state government''s fight against corruption was on which was evident from the fact that police cases had been registered against former chairman of the Himachal Pradesh Subordinate Services Selection Board (HPSSSB) and former vice chancellor of Himachal Pradesh University had to tender his resignation and quit.

On some BJP leaders making an issue of the letter written by the HPCC chief to party ministers and legislators for making funds available for the construction of the Congress Office here, he said that there would be full transparency and a complete detail would be given of the money collected for the purpose.

""It will be better that the BJP leaders first do some introspection before pointing fingers at others and trying to make a mountain our of a mole hill"", he added.

8,Another scam haunts Shinde govt,"MUMBAI: The alleged TDR (transfer of development rights) scam, on which Anna Hazare has filed a PIL, may end up as an albatross round chief minister Sushilkumar Shindeâ€™s neck.

Hazare has accused the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA), of which the CM is the chairman, of illegally releasing excess TDR worth over Rs 250 crore to some builders.

TDR gives builders additional construction rights in prime suburban areas anywhere north of the plot they have surrendered to the govt for public purposes.

When contacted, Shinde denied that he had ordered the slum authority to illegally sanction excess TDR to the builders. SRA sources had earlier alleged that the order to release the TDR came from the chief ministerâ€™office. Its chief executive officer Ujjwal Uke was unavailable for comment.

â€˜â€˜If any person has done wrong, he will have to suffer,â€™â€™ Shinde told TNN. He ruled out holding an inquiry into the alleged fraud because the Bombay High Court is already seized of the matter.

Government sources said Hazareâ€™s petition could open up a can of worms. The petition has named Dineshshaw Trapinex building private limited, Sumer Corporation, Sai Developers and Mukon Constructions as having benefited due to the unauthorised release of TDR by the slum authority.

10,Ulfa chief threatens violence in Bhutan,"GUWAHATI: The outlawed United Liberation Front of Asom (Ulfa) has threatened Bhutan with sleepless nights for flushing out its activists from the Himalayan kingdom.

In an e-mail to the media on Sunday night, Ulfa chairman Arabinda Rajkhowa accused Bhutan prime minister Lyonpo Jigme Thinley of â€˜â€˜lyingâ€™â€™ at the 12th Saarc summit about military operations against Indian insurgents. He warned that the kingdom would not be able to â€˜â€˜sleep peacefullyâ€™â€™ following the â€˜â€˜irritating relationsâ€™â€™ with the Bhutan government.

Accusing Bhutan of â€˜â€˜betrayingâ€™â€™ the Ulfa, the National Democratic Front of Bodoland and the Kamtapur Liberation Organisation, Rajkhowa said, â€˜â€˜It will be very childish for Bhutan to imagine it will have a sound sleep when the neighbours burn in the fire of conflicts.â€™â€™

Meanwhile, Ulfa ideologue Bhimkanta Buragohain â€” who was sent to eight daysâ€™ police custody by the Kamrup subdivisional judicial magistrate â€” accused both the Bhutan and Indian armies of torturing him.

The Royal Bhutan Army (RBA) has claimed to have burnt all the 30 insurgent camps and destroyed 35 observation points of the rebels. â€˜â€˜The last of the 30 camps that were established on Bhutanese soil by the three separatist groups from India was burnt down and the operation to flush out the militants who were dislodged from these camps was making good progress,â€™â€™ an RBA spokesman told Kuensel, Bhutanâ€™s national newspaper.

Ulfaâ€™s camps at Goborkonda in lower Zhemgang were destroyed on January 2. â€˜â€˜We had left the attack on the Goborkonda Ulfa camp for a later date due to shortage of troops. Now there is not a single rebel camp inside Bhutanese territory and we are flushing out the remaining militants who escaped from the camps and are hiding in the rugged jungle terrain in the border areas,â€™â€™ the spokesman said.

11,Railway official arrested by CBI,"KOLKATA: The CBI sleuths on Monday arrested the Divisional Materials Manager, Eastern Railway, while accepting bribes from a supplier. The sleuths raided D.N.Prasadâ€™s chamber at the Divisional Railway Managerâ€™s office in Howrah and trapped the senior officer ""red-handed"".

In what came as a shock for most railway officers, Prasad was arrested under the Prevention of Corruption Act.

He is accused to have accepted illegal gratification to pass certain purchase order for the Eastern Railwayâ€™s.

Though East railway officers claimed their own vigilance cell had no complaints against Prasad, a supplier had recently approached the CBIâ€™s Anti-Corruption Cell complaining that Prasad had been demanding bribes for him.

CBI officers said they then kept the senior official under ""surveillance"" and set up a trap in which the supplier offered the DMM, Rs 600 as bribe. The moment Prasad accepted that the sleuths arrested him from his chambers.

This was just before the afternoon lunch hours when the offices were brimming with activity. The CBI sleuths were aided by officers of Howrahâ€™s Golabari police station.

The senior officers, sources said, were in-charge of the stores section of the East Railways Howrah division. This job entailed him to engage private suppliers to procure materials on behalf of the railways. These were not just commodities, but simple stationeries as well.

The supplier â€” who sold stationeries â€” reportedly told CBI that he was promised a â€œlucrative supply orderâ€� only if he paid some bribes.

When the supplier reportedly put his foot down, the senior official had even threatened to revoke the supply order prompting the person to lodge a complaint with the CBI.

CBI officers said they are now scrutinising the statements made by Prasad. They said they would try and scout for the alleged assets amassed by the senior officer. His office premises has already been seized.

Though CBI officers would not confirm, sleuths are examining several documents relating to allotting orders from the office premises.

The arrest comes in wake of a sustained crackdown by the CBI on corruption at high places. This follows the arrest of a top Airport official, a senior customs appraiser and even two RPF men.

The arrests also revealed the property accumulated by them disproportionate to their known sources of earning.

12,"Modi, Kurien spar on Gujarat govt size","ANAND: This was not what visitors to the agricultural fair at Anand, home to the Amul cooperatives story, had expected on Monday. Chief minister Narendra Modi and the founder of Indiaâ€™s â€˜White Revolution,â€™ V Kurien got into a near-confrontation, after the latter made a remark on the flab in the government in Gujarat and the need to reduce it.

Kurien, who was sharing the dais with Modi and governor Kailashpati Mishra, made at the inauguration of the Krishi Mela a point heâ€™s made often earlier: â€œDuring the stateâ€™s formation in 1960, there was only one chief minister and seven ministers. Now, there are over 60 secretaries. It is important to reduce the size of the government, because the government is best that governs the least.â€�

He also referred to a remark made by a senior vice-president of the World Bank from Japan, who attributed Indiaâ€™s backwardness, in her speech at an event here, to â€œthe quality of governance and corrupt and inefficient administration that the country had suffered.â€�

Kurienâ€™s remarks were cheered and applauded by the audience but not by Modi. Who said: â€œ He (Kurien) is an elderly person, compared to me, both by age and experience, but what he said is more relevant for others. We have recently arrived in governance. The people with whom you (Kurien) have been for years, are responsible for this.â€�

He continued: â€œAfter years of suppression, we Indians have got into a habit of taking certificates from foreigners. Aa Japan vali ben chaar divas aavi haase, eni paase thi aapne certificate levanu che?(This lady from Japan would have come here for four days, should we take a certificate from her?).â€�

Adding: â€œJapan cannot produce a Dr Kurien, only India produces Dr Kurien. So, criticisms are welcome, but they should be balanced.â€� He added, â€œI cannot ask Kurien Saheb that, when Amul dairy began, how much staff he had and what it is now. Should I ask him? Can I?â€�

14,Depoliticise development agenda: Antony,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Denouncing the propaganda against the government''s ambitious modernisation of government programme, Kerala Chief Minister A K Antony on Monday said it was aimed at improving the quality of services delivered to the people, particularly to the poor.

Inaugurating a workshop on the MGP for media persons here, Antony justified government''s decision to go for Asian Development Bank (ADB) loan to implement the programme.

""A government that wishes to implement welfare measures will go for external aid if it does not find internal resources for development"", he said.

Though interest rate of ADB loan was 10.5 per cent, as 30 per cent of the loan amount was given as grant, in actual terms the interest rate would come only to 5.2 per cent, he

said adding that it was the cheapest rate available.

State lost many development projects due to ""controversies"" of different nature, Antony said and wanted consensus in development matters by ""depoliticising"" the development agenda of the state.

Antony said first instalment of ADB loan of Rs 600 crores was used for repaying loans taken on higher interest by the previous government and next tranche of a similar amount would be used for improving facilities at hospitals and schools.

Referring to the criticism of left democratic front opposition on government securing ADB loans, he said LDF found nothing wrong if it initiated talks for ADB loan, but when government accepted loan it was termed it as surrender to imperialism.
