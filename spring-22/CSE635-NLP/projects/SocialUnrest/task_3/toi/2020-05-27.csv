0,"Two killed, 20 injured in Ranchi violence","RANCHI: Explosions, firing, arson and brickbatting marred the first ever recruitment test conducted by the Jharkhand Public Service Commission on Tuesday. Two persons, including a 10-year-old boy, were killed and at least 20 others injured in the crossfire when the police and supporters of the Adivasi Moolvasi Janadhikaar Manch clashed at two examination centres -- one at Hulhundu, about 14 km from here, and the other at Ranchi College. The other centres which remained disturbed were at Samlong, Lala Lajpat Rai high school, Pundag, St Louis and St Francis high schools at Hermu and Ranchi Women's College. The Manch has given a call for Jharkhand bandh on Wednesday in protest against the alleged police excesses in course of the two-day bandh in the state on May 26 and 27. According to home secretary J B Tubid, the examination was conducted peacefully in the rest of the state. The test was cancelled at all the three Hulhundu centres -- Sacred Heart convent and St Joseph's and Parkash high schools -- while at all other centres it was completed with about 50 per cent attendance. Manch supporters snatched and tore admit cards, looted cash and gold chains, and attacked examinees with bombs, firearms and sickles. They hit the leg of a woman candidate with an axe and tore clothes even of women. The city SP along with some other officials was made hostage inside a Hulhundu centre. The city SP was reportedly injured in the explosions and firing. Though the test was conducted peacefully at Ranchi College, trouble began when the examinees were not allowed to submit their papers. The Manch had called for the two-day bandh demanding that the government should first settle the local resident issue and that no outsider should be given jobs in Jharkhand. ""We are not happy with the security arrangement which is insufficient,"" said Father Antony in charge of the St Francis and St Louis school centres. Tribals in the area lobbed bombs from a nearby church and fired several rounds which was returned by the police. The examination halls were pelted with stones in which an examinee, Indrani Sinha, received head injuries. Shops and other business establishments remained closed and public vehicles off the road in Ranchi. The train movement was normal. Around 300 bandh supporters were rounded up by the police in the state. At least three persons, including a policeman, were injured and vehicles torched in Jamshedpur on Tuesday. In Dhanbad, the bandh evoked mixed response on Tuesday while the examination passed off peacefully.

1,Bihari examinees angry at govt,"RANCHI: Jharkhand state was carved out of Bihar and the state did not exist out of the map of India; yet, Biharis were being treated like Pakistanis in Jharkhand. This was the grouse of people who had come from Bihar to appear in the teachers' recruitment test which was held across the state on Tuesday. Coming out beaten up and harassed from the Sacred Heart Convent centre at Hulhundu, 14-km from the state capital, examinees from Darbhanga, Katihar, Munger and Patna in Bihar felt that chief minister Arjun Munda had ""invited"" them to take the recruitment examination in Jharkhand only to humiliate Biharis. Walking more than 10 km in the scorching heat with no means of transport available, the candidates were flush from both anger and heat. If Munda was not confident of adequate security arrangements he should not have allowed it to be held at all, said Sunita Sinha, who had been camping in Ranchi since May 24.Though she had somehow managed to enter the centre in the morning, she was practically chased out of it after tribal girls tore off her clothes. Police instead of helping us advised us to give up the idea of taking the examination, alleged an examinee Pawan.

2,Slum relocation policy soon,"NEW DELHI: The Delhi government on Tuesday decided to come out with the white paper on the issue of slum relocation. A committee of experts will be entrusted to draw up the much-awaited policy. Delhi state chief minister Sheila Dikshit said: ""There have been several policies and studies on this subject. Now, it is time to bring out a comprehensive policy document, like we did in case of power and transport."" The decision was taken at the meeting of Delhi cabinet on Tuesday. The white paper, to be prepared by the experts, will be brought out in about two months time. The experts will be drawn from related fields, including representatives from Mumbai where a rehabilitation plan is already underway. Dikshit said the mushrooming of unauthorised colonies and slum clusters have had an impact on the civic amenities in the city. ""There is a need to evolve a humane and long-term solution to the problem that affects about 40 lakh people living in these slums,"" she said. The white paper will analyse the present status and will look into different options like, in-situ vertical rehabilitation, cooperative group housing schemes, availability of land and effective land use.

3,Bitta to launch movement against 'political terrorism',"LUCKNOW: The Anti-terrorist Front will launch a mass movement against the political terrorism unleashed by chief minister Mayawati in Uttar Pradesh. The Front has also demanded that Governor's rule be imposed in the state to prevent the situation from becoming worse. Announcing this at a press conference, president of the Front and former Youth Congress chief Maninder Singh Bitta said the kind of terrorism unleashed by by Mayawati would have very serious repercussions in the country. What was being practised in UP today would soon be replicated in the other states, he said and added that the Front would be taking out a march from Delhi to Haridwar next month. The march would have people from all political parties, he added. Bitta, who continues being a Congress member, was in the city to offer condolences to Samajwadi Party president Mulayam Singh Yadav on the demise of his wife. He denied there was any move on his part to join the SP and termed his meeting with Yadav as a purely personal one. He, however, was all praise for the SP chief who, he said, had done much to help the victims of terrorism. Bitta, who was unscathing in his criticism of Mayawati, said she was treating UP as her personal fiefdom. He referred to the occupation of buildings by her and putting in jail people who were opposed to her rule. The Front president referred to the jailing of independent MLA Raja Bhaiyya and the slapping of Pota on him. He said he was opposed to Raja Bhaiyya but his activities did not merit slapping of Pota on him.

5,Activist flays IT offices' policy,"PUNE: Civic activist Sheela Barse, who has objected to the construction of a commercial information technology (IT) complex by K. Raheja Corporation (KRC) Limited in the Raheja Woods residential premises at Kalyaninagar, has written to the central government challenging the policy allowing such construction. Barse has written to Union IT minister Arun Shourie objecting to the nolocation restriction policy for IT offices, which permits the construction of IT offices and buildings in residential zones. While this policy was announced with the intention of promoting IT, which is a non-polluting industry, Barse says that the policy is erroneous as it overrules existing civic regulations and development control rules which specify zoning in urban areas. The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) had allowed K. Raheja Corporation limited to construct a multistoreyed software development centre, in the premises of Raheja Woods, a residential complex in Kalyaninagar. The property has been leased out by the construction firm to Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's (HSBC) software development centre. The civic officials justified their decision to allow KRC to go ahead with the construction of the commercial building arguing that this was in accordance with the IT policy framed by the Union government. In her letter to Shourie, Barse has contented that the said policy is unconstitutional as it is against the fundamental rights of the citizens and directive principles of the state policy. The policy has rendered the zoning in urban areas — such as residential, commercial, green belt etc, which is decided after following elaborate constitutional process with citizens' participation — meaningless. The policy simply shreds the development plans and dumps them in wastepaper baskets, Barse has stated in her letter. Elaborating, Barse pointed out that she and around 170 residents of Raheja Woods had purchased flats in the housing complex by paying comparatively high rates as they were promised a peaceful housing complex with no commercial buildings. She has charged that the HSBC centre, which will employ 1,000 people, will disturb the privacy of the residents. Although a separate road has been provided to the HSBC centre, hundreds of vehicles coming to the centre will create traffic congestion and result in traffic hazard for the residents, particularly children, she said. Barse has pointed out to Shourie that acting on the suggestion of renowned ornithologist, the late Salim Ali, who had identified the Mula-Mutha eco system as rich and diverse enough to merit its declaration as a bird sanctuary, the collector of Pune and divisional forest officials had carried out a survey in 1980. After a detailed study, the forest department had, in 1990, prepared the proposal for a bird sanctuary near the Raheja Woods (close to the plot on which the HSBC centre and its approach road is located). We had purchased flats after checking these details and the official development plans prepared by the local authorities. Now, the arbitrary IT policy permits a commercial building here. This is an infringement on the rights of the citizens, she argued. A top PMC official, on the condition of anonymity, said the bird sanctuary plan was dropped as the Indian Air Force objected to it, pointing out that the Lohegaon air force base is located very near to Kalyaninagar and the bird sanctuary might result in instances of bird hits. The PMC is now planning to start a butterfly park at the site and the HSBC centre and the road pose no problem to the park, the officer said. When contacted, HSBC Pune operations chief Kersi Patel said: We are just tenants in the building developed by KRC. It is their responsibility to seek the requisite permission for the building.

6,Govt never protested to CWC: Reddy,"HYDERABAD: The Andhra Pradesh government has not registered an official protest with the Central Water Commission (CWC) against Karnataka for building a dam across the river Chitravati at Paragodu, BJP floor leader N Indrasena Reddy disclosed here on Tuesday. The BJP leader said the CWC had reported to the Centre that Andhra Pradesh government had not registered a formal protest against Karnataka. ""The state government should clarify on the CWC statement and should immediately register its protest,"" he added. Indrasen told reporters that the BJP MLAs and MPs from the state would submit a memorandum to Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani, who would be in the city to attend the BJP National Convention on May 29, urging him to take appropriate action on the Paragodu issue. It may be recalled that a couple of days back, the BJP had offered to join the Telugu Desam Parliamentary Party delegation to meet President A P J Abdul Kalam and Prime Minister Vajpayee. The TDP delegation, however, met president and the prime minister on its own. When asked whether the BJP MPs would raise the Paragodu issue in Parliament, the BJLP leader said, ""If the situation demands, they will certainly do."" On what could be the stand of Karnataka BJP state unit on the issue, BJP Yuva Morcha national president G Kishan Reddy said: ""State units of national parties will have their respective state interests on top priority. It is improper to ask for a different stand."" BJP state general secretary Laxman, however, said, ""As the BJP-led NDA government has asked the Karnataka government to stop construction, there was no need for BJP Karnataka unit to take a stand on it."" Indrasena Reddy said all political parties in the state were ready to extend cooperation to the government on the Paragodu issue and to protect state's interests.

8,BJP's Vijay Sankeshwar quits party,"BANGALORE: In a sudden development, BJP Lok Sabha member Vijay Sankeshwar on Wednesday announced his decision to quit the party and float a regional political outfit. Sankeshwar, who represents Dharwad North constituency, said that he had already conveyed his decision to the Karnataka unit President Basavaraj Patil Sedam three days ago when he was in Hubli. ""BJP in Karnataka is sinking day by day,"" Sankeshwar said. The party in the state was not ""gearing up"", he said but added that he had ""no problem"" with the BJP at the national level. The new party would be akin to Telugu Desam and AIADMK with the goal of protecting the interests of Karnataka. ""Karnataka's interest should be protected. That is the aim,"" he said. The name of the party and symbol would be decided after holding discussions with ""like minded people"", Sankeshwar, who is the owner, printer and publisher of ""Vijaya Karnataka"", a leading Kannada daily, as also the English daily Vijay Times, said. Sankeshwar also runs the VRL transport group. He said Congress was dominating in Karnataka but was not providing good governance. ""There is no alternative party or opposition for Congress."" BJP and Congress, which were national parties, were losing ""ground and control"" in the state, he said. Apparently taken aback, Sedam declined to give immediate comment on Sankeshwar's decision, saying ""we are collecting the information."" According to party sources, efforts were on to persuade Sankeshwar to retrace his step.

12,CBI will probe minister's servant's death,"JAIPUR: In a damage-control exercise, Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot has announced handing over to CBI the probe into the death of a domestic servant employed at the state home minister's house after the opposition demanded the minister's resignation following allegations of foul play by the victim's brother. Gehlot announced the decision to hand over the investigation to the CBI after the BJP demanded home minister Gulab Singh Shaktawat's resignation and an impartial investigation into the death of his domestic help Badan Singh Rawat. The deceased's brother Roop Lal had filed a written complaint with the police alleging foul play in Rawat's death. ""Although the investigation into the death was being conducted impartially but fingers were being pointed to its impartiality and certain elements were trying to give the whole episode a political colour to gain political mileage by misleading the family members of the deceased. Therefore, chief minister felt it expedient to refer the case to the CBI,"" an official released issued here said. Shaktawat himself requested the chief minister for the CBI inquiry into the case. Rawat was found dead near a rail track at Durgapur railway station here on May 22 and Sanganer police were conducting investigations into the case. A post-mortem was conducted in Jaipur on May 23. But a second post-mortem was conducted on May 24 in Udaipur by a medical board when doubts were raised over the previous one. The brother of the deceased alleged that police was putting pressure on his family members. He claimed that when the body was brought to their village, the family members detected holes on both the sides of the head of the deceased.

13,"Jharkhand burns, Soren arrested","RANCHI: Normal life remained paralysed on the third consecutive day on Wednesday as the statewide bandh called by the Adivasi Moolvasi Janadhikaar Manch was extended by another day to protest against the police firing on pro-domicile demonstrators on Tuesday. While a mob burnt a bus at Hulhundu, near Ranchi, the police arrested Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) chief Shibu Soren's as a precautionary measure. Soren was slated to march to Raj Bhavan with his supporters to demand the ouster of the government, headed by chief minister Arjun Munda. People preferred to remain inside disregarding Munda's appeal to ignore the bandh call or succumb to the pressure of tribal leaders. The bandh was called to prevent ""outsiders"", including Biharis, from taking the teachers' recruitment examination. The JMM said only local residents should be entitles to government jobs. For daily-wagers, the three days were tough. Hundreds of labourers, three-wheeler owners, rickshaw-pullers and fruit vendors here went without work all these days. Munda dismissed the demand of tribal leaders as outrageous. He said his government was committed to ensure the welfare of the people. He maintained that recruitments would be made on merit, but added that deserving local people were getting benefits. He said the paper this time had questions related to the local language and culture. Without taking names, Munda asserted that some ""so-called leaders"" did not want the state to progress. He said they wanted the tribals to remain uneducated to effectively rule over their minds. Asked whether the process of filling other vacancies, specially in the police, would be initiated by the government after the success of the teachers' recruitment test, Munda said it would be considered in due course.
