0,MIDC to develop new water policy to rationalise rate,"PUNE: The Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) will shortly come up with a new water policy, which will rationalise industrial and domestic water rates.

This was announced by Bhushan Gagrani, joint chief executive officer, MIDC, at the interactive session organised by the Mahratta Chamber of Commerce, Industries and Agriculture (MCCIA) here on Friday.

Commenting on MCCIAâ€™s demand that the three-fold hike in industrial water rates be reviewed, Gagrani said whent the new water policy becomes operational, the effective hike will be between 30 and 40 per cent only.

Vishwas Dhumal, principal industrial secretary, said that the new policy will ensure that industries receive adequate water supply at reasonable rates. However, they,in turn, will have to contribute to the maintenance of water resources. â€œIt would be an optimum price, not a low one,â€� Dhumal clarified, adding that the irrigation department, which controls water resources, had changed its royalty rate. The new price will take that into account as well.

Dhumal added that the treatment and recycling of water will be given prime importance in the new policy and even civic bodies will be penalised if they released untreated sewage into water bodies.

About the progress of the proposed international exhibition centre at Moshi, Dhumal said the project consultant would be selected next week. The public works department had already started work on improving connectivity with Moshi. It will also be connected to the expressway and the Lohegaon airport.

Dhumal further said that the state consultancy, Mitcon, had prepared a feasibility report about the proposed auto cluster in Pune.

Later addressing a news conference, chief secretary Ajit Nimbalkar refuted the charge that the state was losing its top slot as an industry and investment destination.

Speaking about the traffic problems in Pune, he observed that road transport alone will not solve the cityâ€™s requirements. The session was attended by police commissioner A.N.

Roy, PCMC commissioner Anil Diggikar, PMC commissioner Sanjay Kumar, MCCIA president Atul Kirloskar and others.

1,College managements to play by CET rules,"BANGALORE: Private professional college managements on Friday said they were willing to fill 75 per cent of the seats through the Common Entrance Test (CET) in the light of the Centre evolving guidelines envisaging a uniform fee structure.

â€œOur demand for a uniform fee structure has been vindicated with the Centreâ€™s guidelines. We have no problem if the CET fills 75 per cent of seats, but our consistent demand has been for a uniform fee structure for all categories of students,â€™â€™ Karnataka Private Medical and Dental Collegesâ€™ Association president Shamanur Shivashankarappa told The Times of India from Davanagere.

The Centre coming out with the guidelines on Thursday appears to have thawed the standoff between the Karnataka government and private managements.

In its guidelines, the Centre said 75% of seats should be filled by the CET but a uniform fee structure be maintained for all categories. The guidelines come in the wake of the Supreme Court order removing government regulations over the functioning of private unaided educational institutions.

Law minister D.B. Chandre Gowda, who is in Mudigere, said the Centreâ€™s guidelines were almost in consonance with Karnatakaâ€™s formula. â€œThe Centre came out with the formula following suggestions from several states. The Karnataka government will also agree to the uniform fee structure.â€™â€™

Gowda said he was considering a proposal to constitute a committee comprising representatives from the government and the managements to finalise the fee structure.

Shivashankarappa said admitting students through the CET cell would give credibility to the admission process and would streamline it. â€œOnce a uniform fee structure is fixed, we will agree to the governmentâ€™s decision on admitting students,â€™â€™ he maintained.

Asked if the legal recourse was still an option for managements if the government failed to evolve a uniform fee structure, Shivashankarappa shot back: â€œSome positive developments are taking place now. There is no need to talk of legal options now.â€™â€™

The Centreâ€™s guidelines are expected to result in a few changes in the draft rules published by the state on April 26. While letting the government fill 75 per cent of seats, the draft rules have retained the 2002 fee structure for medical, dental and engineering seats but increased the fee structure for non-Karnataka quota students.

Upset by the draft rules, the managements filed objections and said they would approach the courts if their suggestions for a uniform fee structure is not considered by the government before finalising the draft rules.

2,Cane farmers look to Kalam,"NEW DELHI: Sugarcane farmers in Uttar Pradesh have sought intervention of President A P J Abdul Kalam to ensure payment of agreed prices for them saying both the Centre and state governments had miserably failed to address their woes.

The farmers under the banner of Kisan Mazdoor Sangathan (KMS) have alleged they are not being paid the state advisory price (SAP) of Rs 95 per quintal in spite of the directions given by the Supreme Court.

""We have met the President and apprised him of our plight. We have requested him to direct the state under Article 142 to ensure compliance of Supreme Court order on payment of the SAP,"" KMS convenor V M Singh said on Friday.

Singh said that the President assured the KMS delegation that he would take up the issue with the government.

He said that nothing stopped state Chief Minister Mayawati from ensuring payment of the cane price dues, now that the apex court has issued a notice of contempt against the state government and 32 sugar mills over the issue.

""The state government has refused to comply with the orders passed by the apex court on January 31, 2001, which gives powers to the state to fix the agreed price,"" he added.

Singh claimed that political parties are not interested in resolving the issue as their coffers are filled with funds donated by mill owners.

He expressed displeasure that unlike the Cauvery water issue in which the Supreme Court issued a contempt notice, their case had gone largely unnoticed.

3,Govt planning policy to meet media needs,"NEW DELHI: The government has decided to formulate a comprehensive broadcast policy in view of the massive expansion of satellite television and private FM radio.

At a meeting convened by the information and broadcasting ministry recently in connection with a Parliament question, some participants wanted to know why no such policy existed.

During the discussion, it was pointed out that the convergence Bill itself was an expression of the government''s intent in this regard. The need for a broadcast policy was being felt only because the Bill had been mired in numerous amendments proposed by members of a parlimentary committee which had examined it.

Ministry sources later confirmed that a draft of the policy was ready and views were being sought before it was finally adopted.

One official ascribed the absence of such a policy to the long government monopoly over broadcasting. ""So long we have been guided by the 1885 Telegraph Act, where was the need for such a policy?"" he asked.

But the technological explosion of recent years has necessiated such a policy. ""A policy has become urgent because we have been overtaken by technology,"" a participant said.

The fact that in addition to a 100-odd existing television channels, some 10 more are in the pipeline awaiting government clearance is a reflection of the television revolution''s magnitude.

Nearly 50 per cent of these are 24-hour news channels. With fierce competition has come a tendency to extend the frontier of news, often calling for caution and restraint.

When the government invites bids for another 70 FM radio stations later this year, broadcasting in the country will enter an exciting phase. The meeting was chaired by I&B minister Ravi Shankar Prasad.

4,A family that has polls every 2 years,"BANGALORE: A family that plays together stays together. But one Bangalore-based family has taken it beyond mere e-cards and formed an association.

Founder-president Prof A Thomas explains how the Benjamin Manickam Family Association (BMFA) evolved from meetings at weddings and baptisms into a formal body: ""It''s probably because there were so many sportsmen in the family that the idea of an association clicked. Team spirit comes naturally to us.""

With 14 families and 150 members and counting, the BMFA took shape in 2000 and boasts among its members Surabi (now in her seventies) to Sophia (now a tender eight months). They are all related to father figure Benjamin Manickam, (born December 2, 1886), a foreman at the Indian Institute of Science in early 1900.

Apart from staying in touch and fellowship during the Christmas season, the many teachers in the family guide the children.

The BMFA has elections every two years, an annual general body meeting which reviews its by-laws, a newsletter every six months, an annual intra-family cricket match, an outstation retreat at which a priest joins them and charity work where, perhaps, an orphanage feels the warmth of a close-knit family.

The AGM is a not-to-be-missed event with fun and games for the children who renew ties and realise that with so many helping hands around, no emergency is too big to handle.

5,Hill party again raises claim for Gorkhaland,"DARJEELING: The Akhil Bharatiya Gorkha League (ABGL) celebrated its diamond jubilee on Thursday.

Founded on May 15, 1943, it passed a primary resolution to strengthen the party and to proceed from the grassroots level with a strong demand for a separate state of Gorkhaland, informed ABGL president P.R. Giri.

â€œAutonomy in any form is not acceptable and when other small states like Nagaland, Jharkhand and Mizoram could be formed then why not Gorkhaland,â€� he wondered.

When asked why the Opposition parties in the hills were not strong, Giri replied, â€œTerrorism exists here and pure democracy is on the wane. But it is the West Bengal government that has failed to restore democracy in the hills.â€�

Also, he told TNN that the hill people were being deprieved of the three-tier panchayat system which is nothing but political murder for the hill people.

â€œIf there is a two-tier panchayat system in the hills, then why are elections to the panchayat samiti not being held for the past so many years,â€� asked Giri.

â€œEducation and law and order in the hills have collapsed and both the state and the DGHC should take strong steps to improve the condition,â€� said ABGL disrict committee joint secretary and former MLA Renulina Subba.

â€œRecently, there have been several murders in Kalimpong and when the life of a DGHC councillor is not secure then what security do the common people have,â€� she added.

6,Complaint against college trust for misleading govt,"AHMEDABAD: In the first major step towards cracking down on errant educational institutions, the state higher and technical education department has filed a police complaint against the Vivekanand Education Foundation Trust for having intentionally mislead the government.

â€œWe filed a police complaint against the managing trustee of the Vivekanand Education Foundation Trust on Friday after having found that the Trust had been illegally amassing educational funds.

Complaints have been filed against the trustâ€™s managing trustee Harishanker Pandya and eighteen previous and present principals of five of the trustâ€™s colleges,â€� said commissioner of higher education Rajiv Gupta. The principals of four colleges â€” Vivekanand Arts College, Vivekanand College of Commerce, Vivekanand College of Education and Vivekanand Vanijiya Mahavidyalay â€” have been named in the complaint.

There are about 3,000 students enrolled in these colleges.

Gupta said the trust had amassed a total of Rs 2.71 crore from the time it was set up in 1968. â€œThe trust has been charged with offences like showing of fake certificates to collect salaries of those lecturers and employees of the government who had been absent for a long time; wrongly obtaining government grants by submitting false utilisation certificates; criminally misappropriating fee of the students; taking UGC grants and government grants for maintenance of college buildings and yet letting college premises be used for commercial purposes,â€� he added.

The complaint has been filed under various sections including sections 177, 181, 191, 197, 418, 405, 477, 423, 424, 463 and 464. â€œIt has been filed by senior officers of state higher education commissionerate as well as principals of one of the government colleges.â€�

The fate of the trustâ€™s colleges, in the light of these revelations, now hangs by a thread. Whether admissions will take place at these institutions this academic session has also not been decided.

7,PM to review development plans in city,"LUCKNOW: With Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee''s visit to Lucknow slated for May 20 and 21, development bodies in the city are beginning to feel the heat. Officials are apprehensive about the Gomati Action Plan (GAP), which appears to be progressing at a snail''s pace.

The project that boasts an investment of Rs 490 crore, is giving a hard time to officials. Moreover, the much-hyped cutter suction dredger machine, Swati is also giving jitters to authorities. The machine has developed snags. Jal Nigam officials say the motor of the dredging machine abruptly stopped working and has been sent to Kolkata for repairs and would be back by Sunday.

GAP, phase one, includes treatment of 42 MLD of waste water from four nullahs out of 26. For phase two, officials have incorporated the diversion of all nullahs to Takraha and treatment of 300 MLD of dirty water. The PM will be checking the progress of the plans.

Meanwhile, 38 ambitious projects worth Rs 1000 crore are lined up to be inaugurated by the PM.

This interim order was passed by a division bench comprising Justice Vishnu Sahai and Justice Abdul Mateen on a writ petition filed by them earlier. It may be recalled that the earlier interim order staying the arrests of the above SP leaders (petitioners) was effective till today. Earlier, the bench had also directed the respondents to file counter affidavit within four weeks.

The state on Friday filed short counter affidavit and sought four weeks time to file detailed counter affidavit. The bench accepted the request and granted four weeks time to the state and further four weeks time to petitioners to file rejoinder affidavit.

It was alleged in the short counter affidavit that after registration of the case the investigation was entrusted to the deponent. During the course of investigation, the deponent recorded the statement of witness under section 161 CrPC.

The CDs and video cassettes which were received from the office of the chief minister in a sealed cover were sent to the Central Forensic Science Laboratory, Director of Forensic Science, Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India, Chandigarh for forensic examination after obtaining the written order from the CJM LKO for the purpose of ascertaining whether the said CDs and video cassettes were forged electronic records or not, as alleged in the FIR.

9,Hold assembly elections: Soren,"JAMSHEDPUR: The Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) president Sibu Soren here on Friday demanded that elections for the Jharkhand assembly should be held with the Lok Sabha polls scheduled for next year.

Soren said his party favoured early assembly polls as it was in the best interest of the state. He was talking to newsmen here on Friday afternoon.

""We need fresh elections to save the state from slipping into total anarchy,"" the tribal leader declared, adding that the JMM was ready for the polls. Soren said he has held ""informal talks"" on possible electoral pact with both the Congress and the Rashtriya Janata Dal. ""We feel the need to join hands with other parties to defeat the BJP in the state. The success of opposition unity was seen in the bypolls for the Poraiyahat where the BJP had to bite the dust.""

Dubbing Arjun Munda as a ""puppet chief minister,"" the JMM supremo observed, there was ""no connection between Mundaâ€™s words and actions."" He lamented the BJP choosing tribals as chief ministers merely to ensure they remain ""puppets.""

""The purpose of Jharkhand was to provide identity to moolvasis and put an end to exploitation,"" Soren argued. ""The benefits of new state were not reaching the rural masses. They were being denied their rights. People were living in fear.""

The JMM heavyweight urged the government to announce the framework for identifying the moolvasis. ""People would take to streets if their interest was ignored in recruitment by the government. The Class III and IV jobs should be reserved for the moolvasis. The land record of 1932 can be treated as the cut-off year for the identification of the moolvasis.""

He cautioned against the governmentâ€™s move to appoint 10,000 teachers without taking into account the interest of the moolvasis. ""The BJP wants trouble between the triabls and the non-tribals for its own political benefits.""

Soren blamed governmentâ€™s policies for the rise of Naxal outfits in the state. ""The common masses, policemen and officials are being killed. Yet the government has been able to work out an effective plan to check the problem. The government should engage the Naxal groups in dialogue to resolve the issue.""

Chaired by I&B minister Ravi Shanker Prasad, the meeting was attended by top officials of the ministry and its wings.

The 10th Plan document too, it was mentioned, has set the government''s goals in terms of policy direction.

11,Naidu may review party ministers' performance,"LUCKNOW: Refurbishing the BJP''s sagging image does not seem to be an easy task for the party''s national president Venkaiah Naidu, who is on his two-day mission â€˜Operation UP'' here from Saturday.

Although Naidu has no official programme to meet chief minister Mayawati, he is slated to have a monologue with BJP ministers soon after his arrival here around 6 pm. On Sunday, he is slated to have a dialogue with the party''s district presidents and its state functionaries to get a feedback. Naidu is also expected to submit his findings to Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who is also slated to come here on his two-day visit from May 20.

What Naidu is exactly to do is not known, but his visit, first after donning the mantle of the party presidentship, is attached with much significance. And if the mood within the party is any cue, then Naidu is also expected to take into his account the performance of BJP ministers, many of whom are not rated ""up to the mark"".

Thus, it is not ruled out that Naidu may recommend dropping some of the party ministers in order to refurbish the party''s image. Some of the non-performing ministers already identified, according to party sources, are Ram Prakash Tripathi (cooperative), Rajesh Agarwal (trade tax), Raja Mahendra Aridaman Singh (health) and Mahendra Singh Yadav (secondary education).

Revenue minister Ravi Gautam has already been denied entry to the Council House. Since he is no more a member of either House, his ouster from the ministry is a foregone conclusion.

Party workers are not happy even with their senior ministers whose departments are too not free from the charges of corruption.

One suggestion, given by a senior party functionary on term of anonymity, is that the party should be given a new look both in the ministry and the organisation, and that experienced people should be sent to the organisation, while new lot should be given ministerial berths.

It will be daunting task to completely overhaul the party, which is in a shambles mainly due to its falling support base. The cause of worry comes from the growing incompatibility of the party''s alliance with the BSP, which is vividly evident by the disenchantment, particularly among workers at the grass-root level.

In fact, the politics of alliance has done more harm than good to the BJP in the state. If the party''s past experience is any cue, then the BJP has not gained anything by its alliance with the BSP. On the other hand, the BSP has grown stronger and stronger by having alliances with the BJP in 1995 and 1997.

But the BJP''s predicament is that it can ill-afford to withdraw its support from Mayawati, with whom it plans to have alliance for the Lok Sabha polls in UP. And, with this background, Naidu''s visit is thus considered to be an exercise to keep the party''s flocks alive with the need for the party''s compulsion for continuing its alliance with the BSP.

12,"Punish babus for job racket, HC tells govt","PATNA: The Patna High Court on Friday directed the state government to take action against those appointing authorities too who had made illegal appointments in any government department.

""If such authorities are in service, they should be suspended. But if they have retired, they should be prosecuted and certain amount should be deducted from their retirement benefits as a penalty,"" says the order passed by a division bench, comprising of Chief Justice Ravi S Dhavan and Justice R N Prasad. The bench was hearing a Letter Patent Appeal (LPA) filed by the state government against a single bench judgment.

The stand of the state government was that since the appointments have been declared illegal, the state government will not make payment of outstanding salaries and other benefits to the appointees.

The bench asked the state government to file a detailed report after summer vacation in July, stating therein how many illegal appointments have been made so far and in which departments and in how many cases action against appointing authorities have been taken so far. ""It has become customary in Bihar to remove from service all those employees, who had been appointed illegally. But no action is taken against the officers during whose tenure such illegal appointments were made or who had made such appointments,"" the CJ observed.

In another LPA filed in connection with the single bench order in Tara Devi case, in which the state government had to pay her the retirement benefits of her husband with interest, the same bench directed the state government that if due to negligence and inaction of any government officer extra payment as interest is made by the government treasury to any retired government employee or his/her dependent, the said officer should be held accountable and that amount should be realised from his/her salary to compensate the loss to the government exchequer.

Tara Devi, whose husband, who was a government employee, died in harness and even after filing a writ in the high court she did not receive the outstanding salary and other retirement benefits of her husband and her writ was dismissed. But when she filed an LPA, she received all the dues with interest.

Juvenile Justice Act: In writs filed for implementation of Juvenile Justice (Case and Protection of Children) Act, 2000, and rehabilitation of disabled persons as per Disabilities (Equal Opportunity, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act, 1995, the same bench expressed its annoyance over the inaction of the state government in implementing the two Acts in toto.

The bench directed the state government to present before it in July the complete action plan for implementation of these two Acts in the state.

13,Govt to bring in new sports policy,"GANDHINAGAR: In a bid to promote sports activities, the state government has decided to formulate a new sports policy under which corporate houses will be invited to chip in their bit and fulfill their social responsibility towards the sports-loving people of Gujarat.

In the proposed policy, the corporate firms would be asked to adopt a sport of their choice and also bear the financial burden of creating infrastructure facilities of that particular sport on a joint-venture basis.

For instance, if a corporate firm wants to promote football, it may also undertake responsibility of constructing a stadium and provide a coach.

Another important feature of the policy will be to encourage traditional sports such as kabaddi, kho kho and malkham in the rural areas.

The government is also contemplating reserving jobs for sportspersons in the private sector and government establishments, as a part of its new policy that is likely to be announced at the start of the new academic year around July-August.

State minister for sports and cultural activities Anandiben Patel told TNN, â€œWe have decided to give a new direction to sports in the state by giving priority to traditional Indian games in the rural areas as it is from there that sportsmen have earned laurels for Gujarat at national level sports meet.â€�

She added that sportspersons from the state have bagged 125 gold medals in various categories at the national games held in Nagpur last year.

The Sports Authority of Gujarat will be overhauled to facilitate these plans once the new policy is finalised.

When asked about the new sports policy, secretary to the government and in-charge of sports and cultural activities V N Maira said that officials have started interacting with the concerned parties in connection with the new policy that should be evolved within the next two months.

He added, â€œThe state government would also make greater financial allocations for the new ventures that are aimed at promotion of sports in Gujarat.â€�

Under the new policy, school and college students opting for sports would be given grace marks.

""It is unfortunate that Congress is pursuing a soft Hindutva line which is paying rich dividends to the communal forces in the country,"" he told reporters here.

Pawar, who is here in connection with his party''s State Conference, said while other Opposition parties were vehemently opposing BJP during the Gujarat elections, ""the Congress preferred a soft line"" on the issue.

Congress-led UDF Government in Kerala was also acting in a similar manner, he said, referring to the recent distribution of tridents in the state.

He replied in the negative when asked if NCP would align with Congress in the future in opposing BJP. ""While our main fight is against BJP, we have differences with Congress too,"" he said, adding his job right now was to develop NCP at the national level.

""Within three years of its formation, NCP has succeeded to gain representation in eight State assemblies,"" the former Defence Minister said, adding NCP was concentrating on establishing its presence in several more states by working together with regional parties.

17,New law to govern co-op banks soon,"HYDERABAD: The government will soon enact a separate law to regulate cooperative urban banks and urban cooperative credit societies, cooperation minister Ch Ramachandra Rao said on Friday.

Speaking at a workshop on ""The new proposed legislation to govern and regulate urban cooperative banks,"" the minister said the entry norms for cooperative urban banks were liberal and it had become easy for ''unscrupulous'' groups of people to register cooperative urban banks.

The management boards and staff of some of these banks had no professional competence, he said.

Highlighting the features of the proposed bill to check the irregularities in cooperative banks, he said that the promoters of the bank should not be less than 21 persons and be from different families. Further, they should not be defaulters to any bank or financial institutions and should not be facing any criminal prosecution under any law, he said.

Any cooperative society which wants to be converted as bank has to comply with the conditions before registering as a bank under this Act. Its net worth and entry point level capital should not be less than Rs 5 crore and membership should exceed 2,000, he said.

The minister said under this Act, the registrar and the RBI were given the power to order for reconstruction, amalgamation, division or merger of the bank.

18,CBI summons two lawyers in graft case,"HOSHIARPUR: The CBI on Friday summoned two city lawyers R P Dheer and Sham in the infamous corruption case registered against former district and sessions judge, Jalandhar, R M Gupta by the CBI.

Gupta had been district and sessions judge, Hoshiarpur, three years ago and Dheer in a statement to the press a couple of days ago had claimed that he had raised the issue of Gupta''s corruption while Gupta was posted here.

The chief minister also announced removal of the Senior Superintendent of Police, Lucknow, Anil Kumar Agarwal saying, ""the family members of the deceased have accused him of tampering with the evidence"". Mayawati said, ""if Tripathi is cleared in the CBCID inquiry he would be reinducted into the ministry. If he is found guilty .... I will expel him from the BSP."" The chief minister's action comes in the wake of increasing demands from the Opposition parties clamouring for the minister's scalp amid allegation that police and the government were indulging in a cover up operation. Two days after the murder of Madhumita at her residence here, her sister Nidhi Shukla had alleged that Tripathi's wife was behind the killing as she resisted the young poetess's prayer to the minister to marry her. At the time of murder Madhumita was pregnant. The foetus was removed but was yet to be sent for a DNA test. Nidhi on Friday denied her sister was pregnant but Director General of Police Aim Singh said Madhumita was seven months' pregnant when she was killed.

20,'Delimitation can't be completed before LS polls',"AJMER: The process of delimitation of constituencies will not be completed before the Lok Sabha elections in 2004 and all Assembly and parliamentary polls would be held under the present dispensation, Delimitation Commission Chairman Justice Kuldeep Singh said. Since 2001 Census has been made the basis for delimitation the work for reorganising constituencies would have to start afresh after passing of the constitutional amendment, which has to be endorsed by half the total number of Assemblies in the country, Singh told reporters here on Friday. Registrar General of India had assured to provide new Census figures by October this year, he said. The delimitation of constituencies was necessary as population had increased 84 per cent between 1971 and 2001 resulting in disproportionate population figures in different constituencies. While Chandani Chowk parliamentary constituency in Delhi had only four lakh voters the outer Delhi constituency had 38 lakh electorate, he added.

22,"TN govt suspends 1,200 striking medicos","CHENNAI: Acting tough, the Tamil Nadu government on Saturday suspended 1,200 of the 5,000 striking medical students after talks on their demands broke down as they refused to call off their four-week stir. The disciplinary action, which prevents them from taking their semester end exams in June, came after the deadline given by the government to the students to call off their strike expired. The representatives of the striking students met director of medical education C Ravindranath and handed over a memorandum demanding that private medical colleges should not be allowed to come up in the state. The students have been on strike since April 23 pressing for Medical Council of India's recognition to as many as 79 courses offered in various government and private medical colleges, increase in stipend, ban on opening of private medical colleges and withdrawal of moves to revise fees. Ravindaranath told reporters that the government had taken action against 1,200 students for participating in the strike and they would not be able to take their ensuing semester examinations. Health Minister S Semmalai later told reporters that the students had ""exceeded their limits"" and were ""pressurising"" the government on policy matters, which would not be tolerated. However, the students asserted that their stir would continue till the government withdrew its order, relaxing the rules for setting up of medical colleges, even within a 100 km radius. The earlier order had stipulated that the distance between two medical colleges should not be less than 100 km.

25,Antony government enters third year,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The A K Antony-led United Democratic Front government in Kerala entered its third year on Saturday with the claim of having put the state, which was facing an acute financial crisis two years ago, on a path of progress. Despite the shadow cast by police action on adivasis at Muthanga and the communal violence at Marad which claimed nine lives, the Antony government had been striving hard to push its reform and development agenda. The government claims that the successful conduct of Global Investor Meet at Kochi, coupled with bold policy initiatives in the labour and educational fronts helped create an investment-friendly climate in the state. However, the main opposition Left Democratic Front rejects the government's claim in this regard alleging that the sum total of UDF's policy initiatives is to relieve the government of its responsibilities in the social-service sector achieved over decades as a result of the much-acclaimed Kerala model of development. Chief Minister A K Antony who had often found himself under attack from the opposition as well as from detractors in Congress over a host of issues including the police policy had made it clear that he would concentrate on development in the next three years, steering clear of confrontationist politics. The first two years in office, he said, was a journey from crisis to crisis which he could overcome with the support of the people.

26,MIDC working on water policy,"PUNE: The Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) will shortly come up with a new water policy, which will rationalise industrial and domestic water rates. This was announced by Bhushan Gagrani, joint chief executive officer, MIDC, at the interactive session organised by the Mahratta Chamber of Commerce, Industries and Agriculture (MCCIA) here on Friday. Commenting on MCCIA's demand that the three-fold hike in industrial water rates be reviewed, Gagrani said whent the new water policy becomes operational, the effective hike will be between 30 and 40 per cent only. Vishwas Dhumal, principal industrial secretary, said that the new policy will ensure that industries receive adequate water supply at reasonable rates. However, they,in turn, will have to contribute to the maintenance of water resources. It would be an optimum price, not a low one, Dhumal clarified, adding that the irrigation department, which controls water resources, had changed its royalty rate. The new price will take that into account as well. Dhumal added that the treatment and recycling of water will be given prime importance in the new policy and even civic bodies will be penalised if they released untreated sewage into water bodies. About the progress of the proposed international exhibition centre at Moshi, Dhumal said the project consultant would be selected next week. The public works department had already started work on improving connectivity with Moshi. It will also be connected to the expressway and the Lohegaon airport. Dhumal further said that the state consultancy, Mitcon, had prepared a feasibility report about the proposed auto cluster in Pune. Later addressing a news conference, chief secretary Ajit Nimbalkar refuted the charge that the state was losing its top slot as an industry and investment destination. Speaking about the traffic problems in Pune, he observed that road transport alone will not solve the city's requirements. The session was attended by police commissioner A.N. Roy, PCMC commissioner Anil Diggikar, PMC commissioner Sanjay Kumar, MCCIA president Atul Kirloskar and others.
