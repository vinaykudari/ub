0,CZA issues ‘mating rules’,"LUCKNOW: Aimed at protecting the captive tigress from the male tigers brought in from the wild, and also to ensure the planned breeding of tigers in captivity, the Central Zoo Authority (CZA) has sent a fresh set of guidelines to zoos in various states.

In a letter dated May 6, 2002 addressed to the chief wildlife wardens of all states and S K Patnaik, national coordinator, Bhubaneshwar, the member secretary P R Sinha has asked the forest officials not to permit the mating of tigers, which are in captivity with those brought in from the wild.

The missive assumes special significance for Uttar Pradesh, as a tiger by the name of Guddu has killed two of its mating partners during the act, ever since it was caught from the jungles by the forest department. The new guidelines by the CZA come in response to an SOS by the UP forest department (letter no: 22-1/95-CZA) after Guddu killed a tigers, Shefali, early this year.

The letter states, â€œit has been decided not to mix tigers in the zoo with the wild tigers that have been caughtâ€� and adds that no permission for the pairing of ordinary zoo animals needs to be taken from the national coordinator. Regarding queries about the mating procedures, the CZA has said, â€œsince mating is a normal management practise, zoo directors can take their own decisions on the subjectâ€�.

It has also advised that care be taken as a safeguard, to ensure that closely related animals not be paired.

1,"Varsity students seek mercy, ask for riot grades","AHMEDABAD/VADODARA: â€˜â€˜Respected Sir, I am leaving this money for you. I could not prepare for exams due to large-scale communal disturbances. Please, please be kind enough to give me pass marks and save my career.â€™â€™

This desperate plea accompanying a Rs 20-note pasted with brown-tape in the centre pages of the answer sheet of a third-year BA student was discovered by a professor during the ongoing central assessment of answer sheets in the Gujarat University (GU) campus.

A similar plea was reportedly made by yet another student of first-year B.Com who urged the professor to at least grant him pass marks. â€˜â€˜I could not even study a bit because of the tense situation prevailing. Please save me from losing a year by obliging me with pass marks,â€™â€™ the student is reported to have written.

However, there is no room for sympathy. These cases have been reported to the higher authorities as that of malpractice. â€˜â€˜This act of trying to influence the teacher assessing the answer-paper is categorised as a case of malpractice,â€™â€™ conceded GU examination controller Satish Bhatt.

Such fervent pleas are also coming from students of M.S. University, Vadodara, where an English professor reportedly came across at least 10 such appeals. â€˜â€˜The riots seem to be the common excuse for most students this year for their poor performance. We donâ€™t take cognisance of these,â€™â€™ said one teacher.

However, in Ahmedabad, Bhatt revealed, the disciplinary action for such an act would be decided by the Pariksha Shuddhi Samiti that looks into the cases of malpractice registered during the exams. â€˜â€˜Here, the student could be faced with the prospect of losing a year. The paper of the student, wherein he was reported to have made such requests, could be cancelled. Moreover, he could also be barred from taking the supplementary exam to be held in October,â€™â€™ Bhatt said.

If you are aghast at the tough stance taken by GU, sources say that as the central assessment of GU exam papers progresses, the professors can expect to stumble upon more such desperate pleas.

â€˜â€˜This is a common modus operandi of students to invoke sympathy. Some would go to the extent of pasting Rs 100 or even Rs 500 note in a last ditch effort to salvage their year,â€™â€™ confessed a professor.

What is interesting this time is that the students are naming riots for their failure to prepare for the exams. â€˜â€˜In the past years, we have had students pleading sickness, family problems or any such reason for not preparing well enough. But this time, riots seem to be the favourite excuse, even if it is true,â€™â€™ observed a teacher.

Incidentally, on Saturday, vice-chancellor Naresh Ved, while opening the central assessment centre for MA Part I and II examination papers, made a formal announcement that if the professors come across any such pleas where the student has identified himself or herself by writing her name or even putting her signature should be reported immediately.

2,Why govt officials go scot-free,"NEW DELHI: The common perception that the weak alone are vulnerable to the highhandedness of the law-enforcing agencies is fast changing. There are cases where sections of industry, too, have been meted out discriminatory treatment.

Though the Constitution guarantees equality in running business and trade for private and public sector undertakings, the criminal justice system seems to be sympathetic towards public service units .

Various laws governing accidents and providing punishment for wrong-doers are seldom used against government set-ups. For instance, CEOs of mines, where a large number of miners have been killed, have never been tried. Similarly, officials responsible for ensuring safe air operations are yet to be booked and punished for accidents that have taken a huge toll.

The dual standards is palpably visible. According to one estimate, more than 3,000 railway passengers have died over the years but no senior officer of the railway board or ministry has ever been arrested for negligence or prosecuted .

However, officers of various private sector undertakings had to pay for mishaps. Even in the worst-ever theatre tragedy in Delhi, the CBI did not lose time in arresting directors and their family members besides the staff of the Uphar cinema hall. It has also filed chargesheets against them but it ignored the roles of the chairman of Delhi Vidyut Board, the commissioner of the Municipal Corporation and the head of the licensing department of the police.

Theatre owners Sushil Ansal and Gopal Ansal got bail on their counsel Ram Jethmalaniâ€™s contention that section 304 IPC had been invoked against Ansals though they were not present in the theatre when the accident took place. All the properties around the theatre have since been sealed though not a part of the case property, thus causing substantial loss to the company.

Lawyer Lalit Bhasin, who has appeared before several judicial inquiries into air tragedies, also confirmed that persons really responsible for such tragedies involving government-carriers were never tried. â€˜â€˜The law -enforcing agencies are discriminatory in their approach,â€™â€™he added.

3,Kaluchak incident leaves border village grieving,"FARWAL: A pall of gloom has descended over this border village following the killing of BHV Manjit Singh, his wife Jaswinder, son Devinder (2) and infant daughter Gagandeep in the May 14 militant attack on Kaluchak cantonment residential area in Jammu and Kashmir.

Little did his mother Amrit Kaur (82) know that her son Manjit, who had visited her to enquire after her wellbeing just two days before the attack would be killed by terrorists.

For Hardip Singh, Manjit''s younger brother, who is also serving in the Army and was based at Chandigarh when he heard the news, initial shock has given way to anguish. The elders of this border village, which has sent over two dozen youths to serve in the Army, are also deeply touched by the killing.

When Times News Network visited Farwal, the village, to meet the family of the deceased, it found the martyr''s mother speechless from the loss of her son. â€˜â€˜I had urged him to stay on for some more days but since he did not have any more leave, he returned to Kaluchak.

How could I know he would never return,â€� she said. Hardip Singh does not have any complaint against the Army authorities or the civil administration for his brother was cremated with full honours, with both the Army personnel, the deputy commissioner and senior police officials being present to pay homage.

â€˜â€˜Our Government should deal firmly with the terrorists who were desperately targeting innocent women and children,'''' he said.

Hardip Singh expressed the same sentiments when PWD minister Partap Singh Bajwa arrived here to share the familyâ€™s grief, as a representative of the Amarinder government.

Clarifying the Punjab government''s stand on the fight against terrorism, Bajwa said, â€˜â€˜The time has come for the Centre to take concrete steps to end terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir. We have seen the black days of terrorism in Punjab. Our chief minister Amarinder Singh has already clarified that Punjab will extend all possible help to end terrorism.''''

He announced that the village school and village link road would be named after the martyr and a memorial gate would be erected soon by the state government.

â€˜â€˜I have asked for a feasibility report for upgrading the village school. If possible, we will name it after martyr Manjit Singh, the minister said.

4,Principal guilty of corporal punishment: PHRC,"KOTKAPURA: The inquiry conducted on the directions of Punjab Human Rights Commission (PHRC) found the principal of a private school here guilty of locking up eight students of class 5 in a room for long hours.

The commission had ordered inquiry following a complaint by the parents of the students demanding against the school management for subjecting the students to corporal punishment.

The inquiry was conducted by Mohan Lal, sub-divisional magistrate, Faridkot. The incident took place about a year ago. The principal of Gandhi Memorial Senior Secondary School, Kot Kapura had allegedly locked up eight students of class 5 in a store room of the school for about two hours on May 16, 2001 as a punishment for not completing their homework.

The condition of two of the students had reportedly deteriorated, as the school authorities, oblivious of the detained students, had left after closing the school at the end of the working hours.

The children were freed by a peon of the school when he happened to pass by the room and heard the shrieks of the detainees.

Earlier, another inquiry was conducted into the incident by deputy superintendent of police (DSP), Kot Kapura but the DSP had absolved the principal allegedly in connivance with the school management. The parents had objected to DSP''s inquiry on the ground that the latter was approached by the school management.

7,Union secretary flays co-op laws,"Pune: Former Union secretary P.R. Dubhashi on Sunday flayed the new bylaws for co-operative housing societies, saying they should have been based on the spirit of co-operative principles.

Dubhashi was inaugurating a one-day seminar on the bylaws, organised by the Vitthalrao Vikhe-Patil Co-operative Management Institute, Yashwantrao Chavan Pratishthan, Pune District Co-operative Housing Federation and the Department of Co-operatives.

Dubhashi also criticised the levying of income tax on the societies, saying they were not income generating bodies and hence should get a tax exemption. He also lambasted the buildersâ€™ tendency to establish co-operative societies by constructing big housing complexes. â€œSuch societies make a mockery of the co-operative movement,â€� he said, adding that majority of irregularities and mismanagement occurred in such societies.

Former mayor Ankush Kakade, however, said the changes in the bylaws had been necessitated by the tendency to exploit and harass members of such societies. He urged the co-operatives department to further amend the bylaws if they were found to be obstructing the functioning of the societies.

S.P. Sangle, divisional joint registrar (housing) claimed that the changes had been introduced to redress complaints raised by members of such societies and to make the bylaws more scientific.

8,Indiscipline in party worries TD leaders,"Hyderabad: There is simmering dissent in the lower level of the cadre in the Telugu Desam Party. They are unhappy that the leadership had failed to recognise their services appropriately.

The impact of training camps the TDP had been conducting for the second and third line leadership does not seem to have percolated to the ground level. This fact came to light at a meeting of district unit presidents and secretaries held recently.

The party leaders also observed that lack of proper coordination between the MPs and the MLAs was showing its impact on development activities.While the top leadership was being kept busy by the party president down the line, the cracks in the party are clearly visible, a senior leader commented.

This situation, they said, had given some advantage to the opposition as the TDP cadre had failed to effectively counter the Congress propaganda on various issues like alleged irregularities in Food-for-Work and hike in power tariff, he added.
