0,"Hanspal favours talks between farmers, CM","JALANDHAR: Describing the ongoing farmersâ€™ agitation in the state as â€œunwarrantedâ€™â€™, Punjab Congress chief H S Hanspal on Thursday advocated resumption of dialogue between peasant organisations and chief minister Amarinder Singh to resolve issues for once and all.

Talking to reporters here, he said that farmers should not fell prey to some political parties and desist from resorting to dharnas and disruption of rail and road traffic.

â€˜â€˜The agitation against the state government is totally unwarranted as most of farmersâ€™ demands are directly concerned with the Central government. The NDA government is deliberately not allowing the Punjab government to sell levy sugar to reimburse the arrears of sugarcane growers of the state for the past about two years, which is causing disillusionment among farmers,â€� he said.

Besides, the Central government had decided not to hike the paddy MSP, which was again, detrimental to the interests of Punjab farmers, he said, adding that he would try to remove deadlock over talks among the state farmers and the chief minister.

Downplaying the recent incident of lathi-charge at Bathinda on Wednesday, Hanspal said that police might have acted to strictly enforce law and order as part of their duty.

â€œThe parties should not try to gain mileage from farmersâ€™ dharnas and agitations as it can prove counter productive. The Congress government is committed to safeguard the interests of the farming community,â€� he said.

Commenting upon his reported differences with Amarinder Singh, the state Congress chief said, â€œit is all in media. I have no differences with the CM.â€™â€™

1,Punjab farmers to hold protest on Oct 10,"BATHINDA: Six farmers'' organisations have called for a statewide protest on October 10 against the lathicharge on farmers and the death of Gurdev Singh, a farmer, at Bhai Bakhtaur on Wednesday.

The Bathinda and Mansa district members of the farmers'' organisations will assemble at Maur Charat Singh Wala village (the deceased farmer''s village) on October 10. Members of other unions will be organising protest rallies at the tehsil level throughout the state.

The leaders of BKU (Ekta), Punjab Kisan Sabha, Jamhoori Kisan Sabha, Kirti Kisan Union, Khetibari Kisan Vikas Front and All India Kirti Kisan Sabha decided to continue their agitation against the repressive policies of the state and Union government. The farmers'' leaders said that they would decide what to do next on October 10, when the bhog ceremony of the deceased farmer, will be observed at Maur Charat Singh Wala village.

On the other hand, the Bathinda police registered an attempt to murder case against 20 members of farmers'' organisations, members of Lok Morcha, Punjab, and student leaders on Wednesday. All of them have been arrested.

Sukhdev Singh Kokrikalan, state general secretary of BKU-Ekta (Ugrah group), also booked in the attempt to murder case, has been admitted to the civil hospital, Bathinda, as he suffered several fractures in the police lathicharge. He is currently in police custody.

His arrest has not been made public yet as the police is still waiting for the reaction of farmers'' organisations, sources said.

The police have arrested ten farmers including BKU-Ekta (Ugrah) president Joginder Singh Ugrah from the civil hospital, Bathinda, on Wednesday. They were booked in the attempt to murder case and later remanded to judicial custody till October 13.

On the other hand, the Kot Fatta police in Bathinda and railway police have registered two different cases against 10 farmers.

2,Pvt schools justify 'development fee',"BANGALORE: The government''s move to invoke penalty clauses against private schools which violate the Karnataka Education Act and collect donations, has drawn flak from the schools. They argue that ""development fee'''' is necessary to sustain the quality of teaching in an institution.

The government has appointed district inspection committees to continuously supervise the fee collected by private schools, and also decided to award a six-month jail term with fine of Rs 1,000 against schools which fleece parents during admission. ""Infrastructure development fee is a must for growth of an institution. We have to update or improve our infrastructure from time to time.

The Supreme Court itself has ruled that schools can collect infrastructure development fees. But I believe it should not be linked to admission,'''' principal of Bishop Cottons'' Boys high school A. Ebenezer said. According to him, the school charges Rs 2,000 every year from each student towards infrastructure development. ""We put it to use fully. Almost the entire administration is computerised and we have special facilities on our campus,'''' Ebenezer added.

Principal of Carmel High school, Basaveshwaranagar Dorothy Menezes, agreed with Ebenezer. ""We have to maintain the school and update it from time to time. And we need funds for it. Probably, the best solution would be for the government to provide aid to private schools as well so that we just run the institution,'''' she said. Principals feel the government should monitor schools which fleece students, but shouldn''t harass them. ""They are free to examine our accounts and see if the funds collected from parents are being actually put to use for students.

Arresting those running institutions may not be a feasible solution for the government,'''' suggested a principal from a prominent school who preferred anonymity. But primary and secondary education minister B.K. Chandrasekhar himself agreed that it may not be practical for the government to impose severe penalty on schools. ""All said and done, we must respect their service in the field of education. But then, policing is required to ensure there is no exploitation,'''' he justified.

3,Man arrested for credit card fraud,"NEW DELHI: The Central Bureau of Investigation has arrested a person for credit card fraud. The accused, Debashish Chakra-varty, is a former employee of a Direct Selling Associate of a bank issuing credit cards.

Chakravarty had reportedly cheated several credit card holders. He had managed to procure their credit card numbers, expiry details and even the photocopies of the cards. He got the details on the pretext of opening new bank accounts for the customers. Instead of opening accounts, Chakravarty misused the details and purchased railway tickets through the Internet ticketing facility of the Indian Railways on their website.

A CBI officer said: â€˜â€˜The cyber crime investigation cell received a complaint from the railways.â€™â€™ The railways were getting e-mails on their website from the genuine card holders, asking them not to issue the bills.

The officer said: â€˜â€˜The accused was creating bogus identities on the website for booking tickets. He collected the tickets from the New Delhi Railway Station.â€™â€™

On Wednesday, Chakra-varty visited the railway station and produced a fictitious certificate authorising him to collect the ticket. On verification, the railway authorities found his personal employment details to be fake. He was apprehended by a CBI team. Chakravarty was produced before a magistrate on Thursday and sent to judicial custody.

4,Ban on online lottery if affecting farmers: Krishna,"BANGALORE: Chief minister S.M. Krishna said on Thursday that he would ban online lottery, if it was responsible for farmersâ€™ suicides, as contended by senior Congress leader and MP C.K. Jaffer Sharief.

Speaking to reporters after the Gandhi Jayanthi function at Raj Bhavan, Krishna said: â€œShariefâ€™s comments are constructive in nature. If it is proved to be true, I am willing to ban online lottery.â€™â€™ Sharief, speaking at the inauguration of a blood bank at Lady Curzon and Bowring Hospital here, said: â€œâ€�The government is using drought only as an excuse for farmersâ€™ suicide.

A team of social scientists should be sent to villages to study socio-economic impact of online lottery and liquor.â€™â€™ He maintained that the government had to ban online lottery and sale of liquor if it intended to prevent suicide by farmers.â€�A number of online lottery centres and liquor shops had sprung up forcing farmers into gambling and alcohol consumption.

â€œNo party has maintained a safe distance from liquor lobby. The government is in a piquant situation,â€™â€™ he contended. Sharief had blamed online lottery for farmersâ€™ suicide at another event, last week. Later, he told The Times of India, that he will undertake a hunger strike on January 30 (death anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi) if the government does not ban online lottery and sale of liquor.

5,Where chaos is the traffic rule,"PUNE: Acute traffic congestion and disorder at Chaphekar chowk, Chinchwad, has made travelling a nightmare for commuters, especially pedestrians.

Minor mishaps have become common and needless to say, there are three schools located in the locality.

Five roads converge at the chowk â€” the Aundh road, the road which leads to the interior of Chinchwadgaon, the road connecting Tanajinagar, the road which connects the Pune-Mumbai road to Chinchwad and the road which connects Bijalinagar.

Also located at the chowk are rickshaw stands, bus stops and vendors.

Industrial buses and heavy traffic throw the traffic system out of gear during the day and pedestrians have to bear the brunt as there is no footpath or traffic signal at the chowk.

The Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) has identified the chowk as a major bottleneck.

The civic body recently undertook measures to improve the situation, like road widening and fitting of reflectors. But the steps taken by the authorities are not enough to prevent chaos.

Satish More, a resident of Chaphekar chowk area, who also owns a shop, said the chowk was turning into a nightmare, especially for two-wheeler riders, pedestrians and schoolchildren.

He added that the measures undertaken by the PCMC, like road widening, had turned out to be of no use.

""The widened road is being used for parking or is occupied by vendors,"" he said. Sachin Agashe, a student, said he found it risky to use the chowk. ""Many students have been hit by passing vehicles,"" he said.

He added that traffic problems cropped up in the area when buses or heavy vehicles passed through the chowk.

A pedestrian, Mangesh Patil, suggested that the authorities ban heavy vehicles at the chowk and install a traffic signal.

""The PCMC has been trying to solve the traffic problems, but has hardly met with any success,"" he said.

The civic body is aware of the problem. Civic officials are hopeful that the traffic congestion will be eased within a month''s time.

PCMC executive engineer Vitthal Mandlik told TNN that the PCMC was working on a rotary system, which would reduce the problem by 70 per cent.

He said encroachments along the chowk were being removed on a regular basis.

Mandlik added that the PCMC was yet to decide on installing a signal at the chowk, but expressed confidence that road widening measures, among others, would solve the traffic problem to a large extent.

6,Bhoiwada protests boy's death,"MUMBAI: Bhoiwada in central Mumbai witnessed a day-long bandh on Thursday to mourn the death of a three-year-old in a road accident on Wednesday night.

As many as eight others were critically injured when a Mahindra Bolero jeep crashed into them near the Mahatma Gandhi colony on Wednesday.

Locals said Kuldeep Tari, who runs a garment shop in the area, was at the wheel when he suddenly lost control and ran over as many as nine people on the road.

Sarvesh Rajesh Basutkar (3), who lived in the vicinity, succumbed to his injuries on Thursday. All shops and business establishments downed shutters and residents took out a morcha to the R.A. Kidwai Marg police station demanding swift action against Tari, who was arrested on Thursday night.

The residents were enraged because the police initially detained Tari''s driver Vinod Malap for the accident.

About 1,000 people joined the funeral procession. The police tightened security in the area.

A disabled vegetable vendor Raje Pagare suffered serious injuries below the waist as the jeep ran over him, while, Pranoti Salvi (17) went into shock after losing an ear in the accident.

The condition of Shaila Pawar continues to be critical as she is said to have bled heavily following injuries. Among the others injured are Nilambari Salvi, Sunita Gjare, Kalyani Jadhav and one Ms Tiwari.

7,CM's securitymen throw rule books to the winds,"HYDERABAD: Wednesday''s attack on chief minister Chandrababu Naidu, which came as a bolt out out of the blue for security agencies in the state, has shown lax those involved in protecting him have become over a period of time.

There were several breaches of the security protocol on Wednesday, beginning with the one stating who are allowed to travel in the CM''s car. None of those travelling with the CM, had any right to be there in the first place.

It is blasphemous as far as VVIP security is concerned that a chief security officer assigned to protect a VVIP does not travel in the same car as the VVIP,"" a senior VVIP security expert told The Times of India on Thursday. It is the duty of the CSO to convince the VVIP that he or she should never travel without the CSO in the same vehicle. In the event the VVIP insists otherwise, the CSO is expected to immediately inform his superior officer about the state of affairs.

It is learnt that TDP MLA R Rajasekhar Reddy asked the CSO to sit in another car on Wednesday. It is not known at this point of time whether the CSO objected to this or whether Naidu reacted to his party MLA asking the CSO to sit in another car. Yet another serious breach pertained to the vehicles themselves.

In a VVIP convoy catering to a Z category protectee, it is mandatory that five similar looking cars with identical number plates be used, of which two should be bullet proof and armoured vehicles. This protocol was not followed, making it easy for the attackers to identify the car the CM was travelling in.

Fortunately, only one of the directional mines hit the car Naidu was travelling in while three other mines did not, a security expert said. Had more than one mine hit the car, then the result could have been disastrous.

Had similar cars been part of the convoy, the chances of the attackers being confused and targeting the wrong vehicle are much higher, he said. Also, rules for a VVIP convoy were apparently not followed on the road to Tirumala on Wednesday. As per the rules, the five cars with identical number plates should travel in order â€” the first vehicle should be the pilot with guards carrying automatic weapons, second vehicle carrying the VVIP, two other vehicles carrying escort teams moving very close to the VVIP vehicle to rush to the sides and take the impact of any attack and the fifth car a spare, which should be a bullet proof vehicle.

Heading all the five vehicles should be an advance pilot. Incidentally, even after the mine blast, the security lapses were there for all to see. Nearly everyone jumped from their cars once the dust settled, and rushed to the car the CM was travelling in. Such actions create confusion.

But this would not have happened had mock drills that simulate accidents and other mishaps involving VVIP vehicles been carried out. Only if such drills are conducted do everyone in the convoy know what exactly to do to rescue the victims as each one''s role is clearly defined, the expert said.

Also, none of the drivers that are assigned for VVIP convoys are trained in ''convoy driving'' which requires specialised skills as a tight knit formation is required on the road. Further, the drivers should be trained to take evasive action to thwart any attack, something that is not done in the state, the expert said. The Blue Book (rule book) on VVIP and VIP security prescribes certain guidelines to ensure fool-proof safety.

Advance Security Liaison (ASL) report must be sent to the intelligence headquarters. Only then will the VVIP programme be fixed. The ASL report includes the consent of the programme in-charge, unit police head, the district collector and the DSP, intelligence.

The Chief Security Officer of the VVIP or VIP should ensure that similar looking vehicles with identical registration numbers are arranged for the convoy. Irrespective of the place being visited by the VVIP who is a Z-category protectee, the administration should provide five cars with identical number plates and other similarities.

The CSO should travel in the same car in which VVIP travels and the VVIP should take the rear left seat. In case the CSO is asked to travel by a different car, the CSO should convince the VVIP and sensitise him about security. If the VVIP does not relent, the CSO should immediately inform his superiors.

The convoy should be in order. First in the convoy should be the advance pilot followed by pilot carrying personnel equipped with automatic weapons, VVIP car, two escort vehicles moving very close to the VVIP vehicle on both sides to provide cover in case of an attack and last in the line should be the spare vehicle.

Constables in the route bundobust should be briefed in advance by the local officers about the precautions to be taken. Only trained personnel like officers from armed reserve and special police, should be posted for the VVIP or VIP security duties.

8,Troops to Iraq not ruled out,"NEW DELHI: Adopting a wait and watch approach, India on Friday said it would have to see how much more would need to be done to make the new US draft resolution on Iraq acceptable to all even as it advocated that the document has to incorporate some of the ""basic points"" including the issue of UN role and control over Iraq''s economic and natural resources.

""We don''t have any view as yet. It has been just been presented to the P-5 and P-10... the discussions are at initial stages. We will have to see how much more would need to be done to make this acceptable to all concerned,"" Foreign Secretary Kanwal Sibal told reporters.

Observing that the intention would be to have a resolution which would be passed unanimously, he said, ""The resolution has to incorporate some of the basic points major countries have been making about UN role, political process and the deadlines for this, control over Iraq''s economic and natural resources and the funds etc. This is an ongoing process. Let us see what happens,"" he said.

France, Russia, Germany and UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan have expressed strong reservations on the revised US resolution that emphasises on eventual transfer of power to Iraqis but still leaves the US-led coalition in firm control of Iraq.

They want the US-led coalition authority to transfer power within months, preferably by the end of the year, to an expanded governing council.

Annan would like the United Nations to have a clear-cut mandate so that there is no blurring of the responsibilities and also wants the world body to work independently of the coalition.

9,"CPI to support farmers' agitation, protest lathi charge","CHANDIGARH: Punjab CPI secretary Joginder Dayal has condemned the state government for adopting repressive policies against farmers.

In a statement here on Friday Dayal took exception to the police lathi charge on farmers a day after one of the agitating farmers had been run-over by a speeding train in Bathinda district.

He said the Amarinder Singh government had backed out of all promises made to farmers in its election manifesto and had now decided to stiffle their protest by resorting to police repression.

While justifying farmers'' demands like grant of bonus on paddy, and restoration of supply of free power and irrigation water, Dayal demanded the government to insitute a judicial inquiry into both the incidents and withdraw cases against farmers.

He said the CPI would support farmers'' call to observe October 10 as a protest day.

The CPI state executive would meet on October 13 to take stock of the situation and evolve a strategy to moblise public opinion in favour of farmers'' demands.

10,Did govt officials pocket all NRI garba passes?,"AHMEDABAD/VADODARA: When the state government asked major garba organisers at the commencement of Navratris to keep a number of seats reserved for NRIs and foreigners, the wishful thinking was that there will be a large number of foreign guests visiting the venues.

According to organisers in Ahmedabad, the authorities from the tourism department had instructed them to reserve 200 seats for NRIs. However, at most garba grounds, organisers said that many of those coming wearing the ''NRI status'' on their sleeve are actually officials from the collectorate and tourism department, with family and friends.

""We were approached by the state government to make special seating arrangement for around 200 NRIs,"" said Girish Dani, secretary of Karnavati Club. The club authorities, however, asked the government to print its own passes which will be acknowledged by the club. It also offered a separate enclosure for NRIs.

However, organisers said very few NRIs and foreigners turned up. ""We had made separate arrangements for NRIs. But it was mainly occupied by employees from government offices,"" said one disgruntled organiser. He said several government officials were moving around with letters stating that they were supposed to collect passes for NRIs and delegates attending the ''Vibrant Gujarat'' summit.

The collectorate and tourism department officials, however, said they have not demanded any passes. ""The collectorate has not demanded any passes from anybody,"" said Ahmedabad collector Anita Karwal.

""We had asked organisers with whom we have tied up to keep a provision of 200 seats for NRIs. But that was a part of the understanding. We have not pressurised any organiser to give us passes. I believe some people, who are jealous of the success of the show, are trying to malign the name of the tourism department,"" said managing director of Tourism Corporation of Gujarat Ltd (TGCL) D K Rao.

In Vadodara too, the NRI turnout at garba grounds has been dismal. The Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) disbursed nearly 230 composite passes to ''NRIs'' which allowed them to attend four popular garbas in the city. However, most of the seats were occupied by locals.

""It was illogical to track down the NRIs. They knew exactly where they wanted to go. Most of them have been coming to the city for the past 15 years and were well informed of the popular venues. Only 20 NRIs have actually made the effort of contacting the district collectorate for passes,"" quipped a Vadodara official.

""Not more than 20 NRIs dropped in at our venue.We did not issue special passes for NRIs, but as and when state guests came in, we allowed them inside,"" said United Way resource mobilisation manager Yogesh Gangwal.

Sonia Shah, one of the organisers of Shishu Sanskrutik garba at Ellora Park, said, ""Apart from the 30 students from Turkey who came here to present their traditional dance, we have not seen a single foreign guest turning up at our venue. I wonder where all the NRIs may have gone.""
