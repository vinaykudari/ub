0,Naidu may drop 4 scam-tainted ministers,"HYDERABAD: With corruption charges against ministers and bureaucrats damaging the governmentâ€™s image, chief minister Chandrababu Naidu has decided to crack the whip in the days to come.

As a result of the unexpected departure of panchayat raj minister P Srinivas Reddy, Naidu has been advised to set things right before it was too late. He has been told silence on his part now would be construed as political weakness.

According to sources, Naidu is likely to drop from the cabinet at least four ministers who are perceived as corrupt. He is also likely to strike at a couple of officers of all-India services to signal his serious intent.

Naidu has reportedly told some officers that he had given too long a rope to some of his colleagues. â€œI will not tolerate them any longer,â€™â€™ he reportedly said. â€œI am not bothered what community and region they come from.â€™â€™

Sensing the chief ministerâ€™s mood, a senior minister, whose family has been the subject of nasty whispers, even called a meeting of his family members and asked them to lie low for some time.

1,A house divided on ethics and law,"HYDERABAD: Caught in the crossfire between outlawed Peopleâ€™s War naxalites and the police, home minister T Devender Goud and his brother T Yadaiah Goud are at loggerheads over their duty towards their chosen vocations.

Yadaiah Goud is a doctor who runs a hospital and is the secretary of the A P Private Nursing Homes Association. The issue before them is about doctors giving medical help to naxalites.

With the police, over which Devender Goud presides, booking cases against doctors for treating naxalites, the medical fraternity is in a quandary.

â€œWe are not against doctors giving medical treatment to naxalites. What we want is that doctors inform the police about the naxalites they are treating,â€� says Devender Goud. To which Yadaiah Goud counters: â€œWhen naxalites threaten doctors with dire consequences if they reveal their identity to the police, can doctors inform the police about them?â€�

Only a few days ago, the Yellendu police booked a case under Pota against registered medical practitioner B Narendra on the charge that he gave a naxalite medical aid. The doctor said he had been forcibly taken by the naxalites into the forests to render medical help.

â€œWhat do we do when naxalites take treatment from us without revealing their identity,â€� asks Yadaiah Goud. The Indian Medical Association (IMA) has expressed concerned over the issue. Dr D Dwarankanath Reddy, secretary of the IMAâ€™s AP chapter, says doctors are duty-bound to give medical aid to whoever approaches them.

Asked if there was some way out of the predicament, Devender Goud told The Times of India: â€œI am aware of the problem but do not see a way out. But I do agree that we have to find a way out.â€�

2,J&K border migrants indifferent to elections,"PALLANWALA, Jammu: Even as atmosphere in Jammu and Kashmir gets surcharged by election noises, the border people displaced from their homes along the Line of Control (LoC) due to troops build-up and Pakistani shelling do not see any change in their life. Lodged in tented camps for the past two years and plagued by problems like education of their children, the migrants have little hope that elections will change their lives for the better. ""Unless the Kashmir problem is resolved amicablly, there can hardly be any improvement in our lot. The elections have little meaning for us,"" migrant Darshan Lal said here. Nearly 70,000 people have left their homes in the wake of Pakistani shelling during the past one-and-a-half-year and are housed in temporary camps at Devipur, Pallan Wala and Akhnoor in Jammu division. Living in unhygienic conditions with animal dung littered around, open kitchens and torn-out tents, 37-year old Roopa Devi, who lost her husband in shelling, said ""let there be war and let all of us get killed. This alone and not these hyped polls will end our miseries."" Roopa living amid filthy water pools in a camp here has little hope that elections will better their lot. ""What will the polls give us? Will they usher in peace and end our woes?"" she asked. ""Our first priority is not the polls but to feed and bring up our children,"" say women living in refugee camps. Fiftytwo-year-old Asha Devi said elections would take place and government would be formed but ""no change will come to us as Pakistan will not allow us to return to our homes where all the fields have been mined."" ""We are fed up with promises made by politicians during election campaigns,"" she said looking at empty tins in her small makeshift kitchen. ""No one has come to the camps here to seek our votes as if political parties have written us off,"" a migrant said.

5,CPM asks Cong to unite Oppn for Gujarat polls,"NEW DELHI: Indicating that Gujarat Assembly poll outcome would have far-reaching political implications, the CPI-M on Sunday asked the Congress to play a pivotal role in uniting the opposition parties in the state to take on the BJP in the democratic exercise there.

""Congress should play a pivotal role in uniting the opposition parties during the Assembly polls in Gujarat,"" CPI-M polit bureau member Sitaram Yechuri said in an interview.

6,Godhra incident could be repeated elsewhere: VHP,"RAJKOT: Vishwa Hindu Parishad international general secretary Pravin Togadia said he feared Godhra-type violence elsewhere in the country, if the actions of the terrorists from across the border were not checked immediately.

Talking to TNN during the blood donation drive here on Sunday the VHP leader said terrorists organisations were squarely to be blamed for the Godhra and the incidents that followed. He said three Muslim organisations like the Jamat-e-Islami, the Ahilya Ahiz and Dawat-e-Ulema were helped by the ISI to spread terror in India. According to Togadia, even the Muslims in India were not safe thanks to the ISI and Pakistan President General Musharaff.

Asked if these organisation should be banned, Togadia said in a sarcastic tone that the government policy towards madrassas must change. Madrassas were the breeding ground of the terrorists. And while madrassas were being closed down in Pakistan, the government of India was giving them financial aid. ""Such vote-bank politics must stop if the Indian culture had to be protected,"" he said.

He said ""it was an unfortunate situation where the prime minister had to have a security cordon in his own country. Such a situation did not augur well for the country, and the fight against anti-national elements had to be continued, he said.

About the VHP''s role in the Assembly elections, Togadia said ""elections were being fought not between the BJP and the Congress, instead the fight was between the terrorists and martyrs who were killed in the Godhra train carnage. It was in the interest of Hindutva that both the BJP and Congress unitedly fight the war against terrorism. Or else, Godhra-type incidents will happen all around us.""

7,Farmers protest before AIR office on Cauvery water issue,"MYSORE/MANDYA: Activists of the Cauvery Kriya Samithi (CKS) including legislators K.S.Shankaralinge Gowda (BJP) and Tanveer Sait (Congress) on Sunday stormed the All India Radio (AIR) office in Mysore to protest against release Cauvery water to Tamil Nadu even as thousands of Mandya decided to take out ``KRS Chalo'''' march on Monday.

Hundreds of slogan-shouting CKS workers led by Mysore Urban Development Authority (MUDA) Chairman Sandesh Nagaraj tried to force entry to AIR office demanding suspension of the broadcasting. However, when a strong posse of policemen prevented their entry, they staged dharna in front of the office.

Police took about 100 people into custody when they scaled the wall of AIR office and barged into the reception. However, they were released after some time.

The Mandya Raitha Hitharakshana Samiti led by former MP G.Made Gowda gave a call to the farmers to participate in the ``KRS chalo'''' protest rally on Monday.

8,J&K education minister quits,"SRINAGAR: Minister of state for education Aga Syed Mehmood resigned on moral grounds alleging that the NC candidate for Budgam constituency had fudged his date of birth certificate.

9,Bid to increase draft of rivers stalled yet again,"HALDIA: The much-needed project for increasing the draft of the Hooghly and Haldi rivers, essential for the survival of the Kolkata and Haldia ports, has been stalled once again.

The Kolkata Port Trust has refused to meet the conditions set by Dredging International, Jan de nul and South Asian Dredging Corporation,, the companies entrusted with the implementation of the Rs.350.84 crore river regulatory scheme (RRS).

Earlier this year, the project was halted for the same reason. â€œContractors entrusted with the RRS have given some conditions, not acceptable to a project involving huge amount of government money,â€� KoPT deputy chairman M L Meena told TNN. While he did not specify the conditions, he said, â€œThe contractors were not giving a depth guarantee without which the entire scheme turns futile.â€�

The shipping channels of Haldi, Hooghly and Rupnarayan need at least 9.5metres draft for sustainability of the Haldia Dock System, port officials here said. However, a section of port engineers feel that a depth guarantee cannot be assured, given to the estuary characteristics.

Meena, however, contradicted this view, saying their German consultant, J.Suendermann and CWPRS, had recommended a performance guaranteed dredging, considering the requirements of the next 20 years. â€œThe contractors were not maintaining the recommendations of the consultants,â€� he said.

However, in view of the emergency of the project, KoPT will immediately hold discussions with their consultants and refer the matter to the shipping ministry. â€œFloating fresh tenders may involve another five to six months which may not be affordable to the conditions of the present river draft. The scheme was scheduled for completion in December 2003 and we are already late in kicking off. Decisions will be however finally taken according to the instructions of the ministryâ€�, Meena said.

The Centre had recommended the Rs. 350.84 crore RRS in April 2001 to reduce annual maintenance costs but no action is visible yet.
