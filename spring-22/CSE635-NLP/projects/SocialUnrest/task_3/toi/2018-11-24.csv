1,Changes in cheque-bouncing law,"new delhi: parliament's all-party standing committee on finance has approved the official bill to reform the cheque-bouncing law, subject to certain changes. the bill, amending the negotiable instruments act, was tabled in the lok sabha four months before. it was referred for scrutiny to a panel of mps from both houses, chaired by shivraj patil. the bill was prepared due to various drawbacks in the amendments of 1988 to the basic law, making cheque-bouncing a criminal offence. with its procedure unclear, the courts were confused and punishment inadequate. its bill doubles the punishment, gives a lot more power to judges and make offences punishable by a greater fine, instead of jail. patil's panel recomends: * allow the bank to pay the cheque-casher whatever money is available in the account of the person who's issued it, without impinging on the right to file criminal or civil suits; * exclude non-executive directors and those persons not responsible for a firm's day-to-day working from liability for prosecution; * update the bill to incorporate recommendations on bringing electronic cheques into the law's ambit.

3,CBDT chief rules out cut in direct tax rates,"new delhi: central board of direct taxes chairman op srivastava on friday ruled out reduction in direct tax rates as they were reasonable and comparable with the rest of the developing countries. ''we feel that tax rates are reasonable. i am sure they are comparable to other developing nations,'' srivastava said at an assocham seminar on taxation. he said the government aims to increase the tax base and improve the tax: gdp ratio. ''our target is to increase the share of direct taxes to 40 per cent of total tax collection. we are confident of achieving it,'' he added. the share of direct taxes to total tax collection will certainly go up to 40 per cent at about rs 84,800 crore this fiscal against 36 per cent in 2000, he added. the cbdt chairman reiterated the government's commitment of widening the tax base to 5 crore tax payers by 2004 against 2.2 crore in march 2000. he said the one-by-six scheme has been extended to about 9,000 cities and towns now against 63 earlier. pti adds: meanwhile, central vigilance commissioner n vittal has suggested that the government lift all i-t exemptions and withdraw the scope of discretion for customs and excise to reduce corruption in the tax departments. it may be the right time to take up this issue of moving towards a zero discretion in customs & excise act and zero exemption in income-tax act because of the increasing awareness about extensive corruption and how it is damaging our economic development, vittal said at the seminar. pointing to 211 exemptions in the i-t act, he said income below rs 2 lakh may be exempted, but income above it should be taxed at a flat rate of 20 per cent. vittal said the enormous discretion given to officials prevents them from being challenged by the cvc. referring to the arrest of two top cbec officials, he said it was possible to clean up the entire set of rules and regulations in customs by removing the scope of discretion. pointing to loopholes in the prevention of money laundering bill, which is before the parliament now, the cvc said, even if the act is passed, those who launder black money through banks abroad would have very little reason to fear.

4,Danapur mishap: Safety rules flouted,"danapur: the train accident near the dumri halt on the mokama-kiul section of the eastern railway's danapur division on tuesday evening made it once again clear that the safety arrangements in the division are far from satisfactory. according to sources, the mokama-howrah passenger train (214 down) left barahiya around 4.08 pm on the fateful day. it reached near the dumri halt, hardly four km from barahiya, at 4.15 pm, where the engine of the train developed mechanical snags. the driver had reported the matter to the cabinman of the dumri halt at 4.40 pm. the cabinman subsequently relayed the message of the engine failure to the station master of barahiya. the sources said the muzaffarpur-sealdah passenger train (132 down) arrived at barahiya at about 4.20 pm on the back report of the mokama-howrah passenger train. since the main line was blocked, the station master (sm) of barahiya, on the advice of the danapur control room, detached the engine of the 132 down to push the stationary 214 down up to mankatha where there is a loop line. the ill-fated pilot of the engine, crowded with passengers, mostly railway gangmen, left barahiya around 5.30 pm. asm mahesh prasad and porter mandal of barahiya also boarded the engine with the necessary instructions from the sm that they were to follow full safety rules and proceed at dead slow speed. but instead of maintaining speed restriction, driver b. p. yadav reportedly ran the engine so fast that it went out of control and rammed into the stationary train at 5.40 pm, covering a distance of four km in just 10 minutes. it is said that the driver, asm and porter jumped off the engine when it was about to collide with the rear portion of the 214 down. thus, hapless people sitting on the engine were the only victims of the accident. the moot question is how did this collision take place? obviously, no safety rule was followed. according to the rules, if any train is detained for more than 15 minutes on the main line, the guard of the train is supposed to take full safety measures like fitting three detonators at a distance of 270 metres from one another on the railway tracks, especially on the electrified section. for the sake of full safety, the guard has to make sure if the tail lamp is burning or not. he has to show flare lamp to any passing or incoming train on the same line to avert the possibility of accident during evening and night hours. unfortunately, in the case of this accident, all safety rules were bla-tantly flouted so much so that the driver of the 132 down was allowed to move ahead to assist the stranded 214 down with the normal speed of a passenger train. neither the sm nor the driver objected to passengers sitting on the engine, especially when it was proceeding to push a stationary passenger train during the dusk. carrying passengers on the en-gine was not only a violation of the safety rules but it was also tanta-mount to criminal offence, said a railway official at danapur.

9,SC wants new land takeover law,"new delhi: a five-judge constitution bench of the supreme court friday ruled that compensation envisaged under the land acquisition act (laa) was not adequate for compulsory acquisition of property of minority educational institutions. the court fixed may 31, 2002, as deadline for the centre and all states to enact a special provision for compulsory acquisition of such institutions' properties, failing which all pending and uncompleted acquisitions would lapse. the bench said article 30 of the constitution empowered minorities to establish and administer educational institution, but clause (1a) introduced by 44th amendment in 1978 provided enactment of special law for paying compensation for acquired minority educational institution property. the clause said, ""the state shall ensure that the amount fixed by or determined under such law for acquisition of such property would not restrict or abrogate the right guaranteed under that clause."" it said clause (1a) clearly stated that there must be a law that specifically relates to compulsory acquisition of property of minority institutions. the judgment comes on the society of st joseph's college petition challenging the kerala government notification in 1979 acquiring a property inside the college premises for a post office which was earlier functioning there on rent.

10,"BJP, Sanghatana make common cause with cotton farmers","pune: in a significant political development, the bharatiya janata party has extended support to the shetkari sanghatana which has been supporting an agitation by cotton farmers in vidarbha against the state government. the sanghatana which has launched a rail roko and rasta roko agitation in vidarbha has demanded the opening of the 400-odd cotton procurement centres in vidharbha and the payment of the promised procurement price in a single instalment. while the government till sunday had opened barely 50 of the 400 centres, chief minister vilasrao deshmukh announced that the government would pay the procurement price of rs 2,300 but in three instalments. bjp national vice president gopinath munde said on friday that the government's decision was not satisfactory and consequently, the bjp had decided to support the shetkari sanghatana, a move that the sanghatana leader sharad joshi had welcomed, he said. senior bjp and sanghatana leaders are to meet at wardha on saturday to discuss a joint agitation plan. when we were in government we paid the cotton farmers their procurement price in a single instalment. the congress government is now saying that it will pay the farmers in three instalments. this is not acceptable, he said. since the central government had declared the minimum support price of rs 1,875 per quintal for cotton growers, the state government should at least pay this amount forthwith, mr mumde said. when it was pointed out that the state government complained of a lack of resources, he said that when the sena-bjp was in government, the congress-dominated maharashtra state cooperative bank had extended a loan of rs 800 crore to the government. the same bank is now unwilling to bail out the congress-led government as it is controlled by the nationalist congress party, he alleged. mr munde scoffed at chief minister vilasrao deshmukh's suggestion that since the state government did not have the funds, the central government should allocate funds to pay the cotton growers in maharashtra. the state government wants the centre to bail it out on the enron issue and on a number of other issues.why does the state government not resign and leave all affairs of the state to the centre? he asked. the shetkari sanghatana's cotton agitation in wardha, amravati, yavatmal and other parts of vidarbha has taken an intense form with the disruption of rail and road services. the farmers have been protesting that the government has opened barely 50 of the 400 cotton procurement centres under its monopoly purchase scheme. the government has been finding it difficult to pay the promised cotton procurement price of rs 2,300 per quintal as the price in the open market is barely rs 1,700 and that of imported cotton barely rs 1,500. as the central government has declared a minimum support price of rs 1,875, the state government fears that cotton from other states might flood procurement centres in maharashtra to take benefit of the higher price in the state. mr munde was here to address the concluding session of the bjp yuva morcha's meet to finalise the strategy for an agitation against the state government over the deteriorating law and order situation in the state. the morcha has decided to organise a massive march to the state legislature on november 27 as a part of this strategy.

18,NCP does volte face; Pawar opposes terror law,"mumbai: in a volte face, nationalist congress party (ncp) president sharad pawar on saturday declared that his party would support the controversial prevention of terrorism ordinance (poto) on certain conditions. earlier, his party had declared full fledged support to the new act, sought to be introduced in parliament. speaking to reporters after an all party meeting with the maharashtra chief minister at sahyadri guest house here, pawar said that poto had certain lacunae. the ncp leader said that section 3 of the ordinance defining terrorism was too wide. he also objected to clause eight of the ordinance, which he said, could be misused against journalists and politicians. besides, pawar said, in the ordinance there was no difference in approach between cross-border terrorism and terrorist activities within the country. the ncp leader was of the view that joint secretary in government service was not enough to invoke provisions of poto against an alleged offender. someone from the judiciary should be empowered to do so. without judicial approval, poto should not be invoked, he opined. pawar said that there was no provision of anticipatory bail or bail in the ordinance, which also provides that a confession of an accused before a police officer would be treated as evidence. the latter provision could be misused because it was feared that police might use third degree methods to extract a confession, the ncp leader said. if the ordinance was changed to consider these points, then ncp would support poto, pawar added.

21,New twist to Nakheeran reporter's arrest,"mysore: in a new twist to the arrest of a reporter of tamil bi-weekly nakheeran, police on saturday claimed to have recovered some explosives and a revolver buried in the konganakadu forest zone following information provided by him. chamarajnagar district superintendent of police hari sekharan said that the explosives and pistol buried in a plastic bag near br hills were recovered on a tip-off received by the reporter p. shivasubramaniam. he said that a case in this regard had been registered against shivasubramaniam, who was arrested on tuesday last by the karnataka special task personnel for allegedly moving in a suspicious manner, and possessing electronic gadgets. meanwhile, speaking to reporters in bangalore, nakheeran editor r.r. gopal dismissed the police claim and said that since shivasubramaniam was in their custody, they could extract any statement from him. describing the reporter's arrest as an ""act of vengeance"" gopal, who played the role of an emissary to secure release of kannada thespian rajkumar when he was kidnapped by forest brigand veerappan last year, demanded his immediate release. he said that they were not being allowed to meet subramaniam, who had also accompanied gopal as a negotiator during the rajkumar kidnap crisis, and alleged that false cases were being foisted on him. gopal said that nakheeran had not given any assignment to subramaniam to establish contact with veerappan as of now.

22,NCP does volte face; Pawar opposes terror law,"mumbai: in a volte face, nationalist congress party (ncp) president sharad pawar today declared that his party will support the controversial prevention of terrorism ordinance (poto) on certain conditions. earlier, his party had declared full fledged support to the new act, sought to be introduced in the parliament. speaking to reporters after an all party meeting with the maharashtra chief minister at sahyadri guest house here, pawar said poto had certain lacunae. the ncp leader said section three of the ordinance defining terrorism was too wide. he also objected to clause eight of the ordinance which he said could be misused against journalists and politicians. besides, pawar said, in the ordinance there was no difference in approach between cross-border terrorism and terrorist activities within the country. the ncp leader was of the view that joint secretary in government service was not enough to invoke provisions of poto against an alleged offender. someone from judiciary should be empowered to do so. without judicial approval, poto should not be invoked, he opined. pawar said there was no provision of anticipatory bail or bail in the ordinance which also provides that a confession of an accused before a police officer would be treated as evidence. the latter provision could be misused because it was feared that police may use third degree methods to extract a confession, ncp leader said. if the ordinance was changed to consider these points then ncp would support poto, pawar added.

24,"'CM, not Bhujbal, will decide on terror law'","mumbai: notwithstanding the clarifications from chief minister vilasrao deshmukh and deputy chief minister chhagan bhujbal, the row between the congress and the nationalist congress party (ncp) over the prevention of terrorism ordinance (poto) has refused to die down. while the state congress has opposed the ordinance, falling in line with the party central leadership's decision, its ally in the state government is of the view that poto is necessary to deal with terrorist organisations operating in the country. objecting to ncp spokesperson vasant chavan's statement that the decisions taken by mr bhujbal on the issue should be considered as those of the state government, mpcc vice-president gurudas kamat noted that since the chief minister had said that the matter had to be looked into, mr bhujbal remarks should not be taken as the government's official stand. ""the chief minister is the supreme authority in a government and no minister can take a stand differing from that of the cm. i hope a former minister like mr vasant chavan is aware of this constitutional position,"" mr kamat remarked.

27,Azmi wants national policy on culture,"mysore: actress and activist shabana azmi on saturday demanded a national policy on culture and described alleged efforts of the nda government to distort history as an ``attack on plural and multi-culture identity'' of the indian society. she told reporters at rangayana here that a section of the people had made a systematic effort to distort culture, which should be ``fought against''. though education is in concurrent list, the centre is not bothered to consult the state governments. ``this is an attempt to force a selected view on the people and narrowing down vision,'' she said, adding the people should organise themselves to take on forces of both minority and majority fundamentalism. ``a national debate on the issue of imposing a selected and forced view is the need of the hour.'' on the theatre activities in the country, shabana said a conducive atmosphere should be created for indian theatre, which has its own strong inherent traits reflecting the plurality and multi-cultural identity of india. ``though theatre should act as an instrument of social change, it has other functions to rely on and perform,'' she replied refuting charges that the theatre groups - which originated from the backing of leftist ideology - have diluted their thinking. she rued the importance attached to the theatre activities in new delhi and and said instead of concentrating on the capital, the government must also take into consideration demands of other centres and states.

28,Difficult daughters-in-law: Battle of the 'bahus',"new delhi: it's a case of the difficult daughters-in-law. and a spat which saw the removal of younger bahu maneka gandhi from the culture ministry. all for the nehru-gandhi legacy. according to family observers, elder bahu, sonia gandhi, president of the congress and chairperson of a host of jawaharlal nehru and indira gandhi trusts, sees herself and her children, priyanka and rahul, as the 'true inheritors' of this legacy. maneka, sidelined by india's first family, is trying to claw her way back with an eye for a political debut for 19-year-old varun gandhi. if he enters ahead of priyanka, maneka will have scored a political first. a senior congress leader said, ""if sanjay gandhi's son is a home-grown edition of his father, he may well turn out to be more acceptable to the public than rahul who talks and behaves like a foreigner. today, a lot of people talk favourably of sanjay and his five-point programme."" natwar singh, former foreign minister, indignantly wonders how varun can inherit this legacy. ""sonia is the true inheritor. she is the wife of the older brother who went on to become the prime minister. rahul is the son of a prime minister."" sunita kohli, a close sonia buddie, refuses to see maneka's attempt to edge out her sister-in-law from the nehru memorial library and the indira gandhi centre of arts and sonia's subsequent sos meeting with vajpayee, as a continuation of this clash. ""has sonia ever retaliated? she has been the dutiful and loving daughter-in-law. she is far, far too dignified to get into a personality clash with anyone."" but pritish nandy, shiv sena mp and a close friend of maneka says, ""maneka and her side of the family cannot be easily written off. the bjp and vajpayee have made a huge mistake by considering her to be just one more mp and a junior minister. she is a huge crowd-puller and the single most respected gandhi around, if not the most powerful."" and what does the anand family say? maneka's sister and confidante ambika shukla insists, ""indira gandhi and maneka shared an intellectual relationship. ""unfortunately, indira was held hostage by rajiv and sonia who demanded maneka's head. ms gandhi had wanted maneka as her political secretary. sonia connived and forced her out of the house."" usha bhagat, indira gandhi's personal secretary, believes there would not have been so much animosity if after their respective marriages, each had been allowed to live separately. ""there are always some differences between two bahus but in this case, the political stakes are high. ms gandhi's insistence that they all live together in a cramped 1 safdarjung road only served to complicate matters. but i will say to the credit of all that i never heard them exchange a loud remark or speak rudely to each other. they always behaved in a dignified manner."" so were appearances deceptive?
