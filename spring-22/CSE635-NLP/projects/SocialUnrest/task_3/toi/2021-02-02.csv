0,Punjab has little to spend on development,"CHANDIGARH: This year, like the year before, Punjabâ€™s annual plan has been an exercise in futility: The government has been able to spend virtually no money and the last three months of the financial year promise to be equally â€˜dryâ€™ in this respect.

To begin with the size of the plan had been fixed at Rs 3,200 crore. This was reduced to Rs 2,822 crore after consultation with the Planning Commission. After exclusion of expenditure by the state electricity board (PSEB), Punjab Infrastructure Development Board (PIDB) and the Rural Development Fund (RDF), the outlay stood at Rs 1,786 crore.

So far only Rs 359.22 crore of this outlay have been spent, amounting roughly to 20 per cent of the outlay. Almost all sectors including agriculture, rural development, irrigation and flood control, transport and energy have been affected.

This is not all: The state finance department has said that for the last three months of the plan, Rs 400 crore is all that it has for spending on all plan schemes. Even this amount may not materialise as it depends on the success of the state government in raising Rs 200 crore from the market.

If this is not enough, a look at the governmentâ€™s priorities to spend this money is revealing: Expenditure on hard-core development activities like building roads, restructuring and strengthening of the power sector, irrigation infrastructure are on priority number three. All this money is to be raised (magically!) and spent by the concerned agencies on their own. Not surprisingly in these most important sectors only Rs 340 crore have been released and these largely come from the Centre.

In this list of ""plan"" priorities, at number one is payment of salaries and establishment expenditure: In the last three months of this fiscal the government wants to spend Rs 68 crore on this.

Another Rs 85 crore on pensions. This is understandable: Elections are round the corner and the government much rather give dole out money rather than spend it on politically less exciting tasks like building roads, irrigation, agriculture and the like. In this plan priority, there is even a provision of Rs five crore for fight court cases as well!

In this exercise, however, the expression ""planning"" has acquired new meaning: payment of salaries, money for fighting court battles, rural development and road building jostle with each other uncomfortably, vying for equal attention.

1,Was state govt. aware of Telgi's doings?,"PUNE: In a key development in the multicrore fake stamp paper racket, alleged kingpin Abdul Karim Telgiâ€™s dealings between 1995 and 1999 have come under the scanner of the special investigation team (SIT), which is probing the scam.

Information with the SIT suggests that the BJP-Shiv Sena government, which was then in power, was aware of the Telgi scam. One of the key documents in possession of the SIT is a set of official replies by the then superintendent of stamps, Radheshyam Mopalwar, dated October 31, 1995, which was tabled before the state legislative assemblyâ€™s proceedings on November 18, 1995.

The stamp office in Mumbai had clearly explained, in its replies to the government, that Telgi was selling fake stamps in the state. The office had also given the details of five police cases registered in Mumbai, namely at the Mata Ramabai Ambedkar police station, the crime branch, Cuffe Parade police station, Colaba police station and the Kherwadi police station, in 1995.

The office has further estimated that Telgi sold stamps worth Rs 68 lakh during the period.

The document also revealed that the state government was informed that Telgi was declared an absconding offender by a metropolitan magistrate in 1995. This proclamation existed till 1997.

Although Telgi was arrested in 1995, he was later released under circumstances that remain unexplained.

The set of Mopalwarâ€™s replies was seized by the SIT from the residence of former deputy superintendent of stamps, Baban Ranjane, who was arrested by the SIT on December 8, 2003, in the case registered at the Bund Garden police station, and was booked under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA).

The focus of the SIT investigations is now on the stamps and registration office in Mumbai. The SIT is also investigating whether the scam received any political patronage during the BJP-Shiv Sena government in the state.

Currently, the SIT is busy recording the statements of officials from the stamp office in Mumbai. Some state government officials have also been called to Pune for recording their statements, SIT officials said.

Interestingly, former Mumbai police commissioner Ranjit Singh Sharma was the joint commissioner of police in Mumbai from 1995 to 1998.

2,Hazare's protest gains momentum,"PUNE: Senior socialist thinker G.P. Pradhan, former IAS officer Avinash Dharmadhikari, former mayor Vandana Chavan, former minister of state for home Bhai Vaidya and representatives of 40 organisations will take out a â€˜torch marchâ€™ in the city on Tuesday to extend support to noted social crusader Anna Hazare and the demands raised by him.

Addressing a news conference here on Monday, K.D. Pawar, city unit chief of Hazareâ€™s Bhrastachar Virodhi Janandolan (BVJ), said Hazareâ€™s supporters will stage a dharna in front of the collectorate from 11 am to 4 pm before taking out a â€˜torch marchâ€™.

The march will proceed to the Tilak statue in Phule market via the zilla parishad, Laxmi road, Umbrya Ganpati chowk and Kumthekar road.

Pawar said Hazare and his followers were ""convinced"" that the state government did not have the will to eradicate corruption. ""Hazare demanded more power to gram sabhas, action against administrative delay, law regarding transfers and enforcement of the right to information Act because he is convinced that 75 per cent of corruption can be removed by implementing these steps,"" Pawar said.

He added that Hazare had sent a letter to the state cabinet before the winter session of the state assembly, reminding it of the promise to introduce legislations fulfilling the four demands.

""Hazare also sent a fax to chief minister Sushilkumar Shinde on the first day of the winter session,"" Pawar said, adding that the government did not fulfil a single assurance given to Hazare after he withdrew his indefinite hunger strike on August 17 last year.

""Workers from 34 districts of the state will assemble at Ralegan Siddhi on February 6 to decide the future course of action. Hazare is expected to address them as he will be breaking his maun vrat (silent protest) in the evening on February 5,"" he said.

Pawar said although the government had enacted the right to information Act, there were many lacunae in the draft and its implementation.

3,Finance minister's dilemma: propriety vs populism,"NEW DELHI: Long on politics, short on economics, and heavy on theatrics. If precedent is anything to go by, thatâ€™s what Jaswant Singhâ€™s vote-on-account speech on Tuesday will be like. Possibly with a smattering of populist proposals â€” like hiking the I-T limit and merging the dA of Union government employees â€” thrown in, if the BJP has its way.

But then, interim budgets have a habit of turning into passionate poll pitches. Sample this: ""I have every reason to believe that when the time comes, our people will be discriminating enough to recognise the friendly hand alone can help India move forward and preserve its unity and integrity.""

That was Manmohan Singh, winding up his interim budget speech on February 28, 1996, days before elections for the 11th Lok Sabha.

Expect something along similar lines from Jaswant Singh today.

Of course, not every interim budget is a feel-good exercise. It depends on whether the speech is being made before or after elections.

Yashwant Sinha has the distinction of presenting both varieties â€” first on February 28, 1991, and then again on March 25, 1998.

On the first occasion, Sinha, finance minister in the minority Chandra Shekhar government, was confronted with a major economic crisis, especially on the external payments front.

In response to trouble brewing in the wake of the Gulf war, Sinha had presented a ""mini-budget"" in December 1990. The difference was, while Singh got to hand out sops, Sinha had to hike duties to mop up revenue.

Even so, Sinha used the vote-on-account for the first four months of fiscal 1991-92 to flaunt the ""achievements"" of the Chandra Shekhar government.

""Four months vs 40 years"" was to become the election slogan of the Chandra Shekhar outfit, the interim budget provided the sub-text. He also announced the governmentâ€™s intention to divest 20 per cent equity in select PSUs to financial institutions â€” a landmark announcement for which he rarely, if ever, gets credit.

It was a very different story on March 25, 1998, when Sinha presented an interim budget on behalf of the Vajpayee government, fresh from electoral victory.

The new financial year was beginning in a few days on April 1 and the Centre had little time to prepare a budget. So, Sinha presented a vote-on-account, with little by way of concrete measures or policies. But that didnâ€™t stop him from rubbishing the â€˜dream budgetâ€™ presented by P Chidambaram the previous year. Sinha was all doom and gloom about the state of the economy, but asserted that he would tackle the situation. Bravery or bravado? Depends on your perspective.

Manmohan Singh, on the other hand, had no one to blame in 1996 since heâ€™d been FM for five years. Instead, he chose to bask in the glory of being the architect of Indiaâ€™s economic reforms.

Jaswant, like Manmohan, is a stickler for propriety. But heâ€™s also under pressure from party colleagues to announce some populist sops. Will he walk the straight and narrow, or succumb to the siren song of polls? Letâ€™s Jas wait and watch.

4,Karuna still undecisive on party split,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The Congress MLAs in Kerala who vow loyality to the rebellious Congress leader K Karunakaran have disfavoured split in the party. Consequently, Karunakaran has postponed the official breaking away from the parent party.

Last Thursday Karunakaran had grandiosely announced at a party convention to sire a new party since the party â€œhigh commandâ€� was ignoring him. He wanted Chief Minister A K Antony to go and be invited to lead the government for a while.

In the closed-door meeting held at his residence on Monday, all MLAs, numbering some 19, have cautioned the leader against floating a new outfit. â€œKarunakaran had asked a free and frank opinion of the legislatorsâ€�, said a former minister in the Karunakaran camp. Almost all MLAs, afraid of losing their membership, seem to have raised the bogey of the â€œMarxist ployâ€� of breaking the party. The new outfit, if floated to dare the official Congress, would be at the mercy of the Left Front and no Congressman could stomach this idea, it was pointed out.

It is now seen that since Karunakaran''s son and PCC-I president K Muralidharan has expressed his willingness to step down to join the Antony government, the group would better wait and put pressure on the Delhi leadership for favour rather than threatening with a split. In the crowded and polarised politics of Kerala where all have joined either the Left Front or the Congress-led United Front, any new party will have to work with either camp for survival. If not, it will have the same fate as the BJP which is friendless and forlorn for its â€œunsociabilityâ€� in Kerala.

Karunakaran, it is now certain, has no plan to push ahead for a split. In such an eventuality, his will be a rebel party and his arch rival Antony will head the â€œofficialâ€� Congress. Many veterans in the Kerala politics still argue that it all was a charade scripted and directed by the wily Karunakaran to keep his â€œIâ€� group within the family. â€œLeaderâ€� , as Karunakaran is called, has vigorously denied this.

5,BJP to focus on all-round development of N-E,"GUWAHATI: The BJP will focus on rapid and all-round development, good administration, political stability and peace in the North East in the forthcoming Lok Sabha poll campaign.

6,Modi gives sops to farmers in run up to polls,"GANDHINAGAR: In a major setback to power sector reforms, the Narendra Modi government has decided to allow nearly five lakh farmers to pay their electricity bills till last month at an extremely low rate fixed a decade ago -- Rs 350 per horse power (HP) per year for motors up to 7.5 HP and Rs 500 for motors above 7.5 HP. This is half the rate fixed about three years ago by the Gujarat Electricity Regulatory Commission (GERC).

In yet another sop, the Modi government has allowed the farmers to pay the new bills at the revised rate of Rs 700 and Rs 850, respectively, instead of Rs 750 and Rs 900, as announced earlier. The new rate, Rs 50 lower than the one fixed in eight months ago, would be effective from February 1, 2004, an official note issued here said, instead of June 2003.

In effect, it would mean, the farmers would pay their power bills for the last eight months till January 31 at the rate of 20 paise per unit, and not the hiked amount which was more than double as much.

Already, the protesting farmers, under the influence of the Sangh Parivar farmers'' wing Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS), are refusing to pay the hiked bills, causing the Gujarat Electricity Board (GEB) huge losses.

The state exchequer would have to continue paying an annual subsidy of Rs 663 crore to allow the farmers to pay the power bills at the old rate till January 31, 2004. From February 1, 2004, the subsidy amount would go down to Rs 459 crore annually, said well-placed sources here. An agreement to this effect was reached between the BKS and the state government late on Monday evening.

Soon after the agreement, mediated by top RSS functionary Madandas Devi, a senior BKS leader, Maganbhai Patel, told TNN, ""The matter was amicably settled after Prime Minister A B Vajpayee and Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani intervened."" Former chief minister Keshubhai Patel and several BJP MPs had told the PM that a solution on power tariff would help in the polls.

In a half-hearted attempt to impose GERC order on the farmers in May 2003, the state had announced a decision to revise upwards the power tariff for the farmers from Rs 350 and Rs 500 to Rs 1,050 and 1,200 respectively for the two different categories of motors.

The rate was to be effective from June 2003. But facing BKS protests, the rate was first revised downwards to Rs 750 and Rs 900, and again on Monday to Rs 700 and Rs 850.

At the new revised rate to be effective on February 1, fixed on Monday, the state may have to shell out an annual subsidy which is less than what it had been paying till now, it runs against the agreement reached with Asian Development Bank (ADB), which has offered a 350 million dollar to reform the power sector, senior officials said.

A top state bureaucrat has told TNN here that while the programme component of the 150 million dollars loan had already come, rest of the amount, the project component, 200 million dollars, might get a jolt. It is not known how far will the state, wanting the GEB to go commercial, be able to provide subsidy to the farmers and whether the subsidy will continue once the elections are over.

7,Trinamul-BJP team to meet EC on holding fair polls,"KOLKATA: A joint team of the Trinamul Congress and the BJP will meet the Election Commission as well as the Prime Minister and the deputy prime minister on February 11 and 12, demanding that steps be taken to hold free and fair elections in West Bengal.

â€œIf free and fair polls can be held in Jammu and Kashmir, there is no reason why they canâ€™t be held in West Bengal,â€� Union coal minister Mamata Banerjee said in Kolkata on Tuesday.

According to her, the way elections were conducted in the state by the Left Front government violated the constitutional provisions at every step. While rules of the Election Commission stipulated that repolling should be ordered in booths where more than 90 votes had been cast, there were booths in the state which had recorded 120 per cent polling in the past.

Mamata added that a round of discussions between the Trinamul and the BJP on sharing of seats for the coming Lok Sabha polls had already been held. Some more discussions would be necessary. â€œWe have a good understanding at the state level between the two parties, and an amicable adjustment in seat sharing will not be a problem,â€� she said.

8,Special syringes at govt clinics,"NEW DELHI: The health department of the Delhi government has bought about three lakh auto-disposable syringes to be used at the cityâ€™s 175 state government dispensaries. The syringes will be used for immunisation purposes.

Senior health department officials said that the move was prompted by â€˜â€˜persistent reports of re-use of syringesâ€™â€™ in hospitals and dispensaries, especially in the far-flung areas of Delhi. After the initial introduction of the syringes at the dispensaries on a â€˜â€˜trial basisâ€™â€™, all other state government health setups, including hospitals, will follow suit.

Auto-disposable syringes, popularly known as AD syringes, are automatically rendered useless after one injection. The AD mechanism works by locking the plunger of the syringe after the injection is administered. The next time there is an attempt to use the same syringe, the plunger breaks.

According to Dr R N Baishya, director of health services, â€˜â€˜Our dispensaries and health centres are situated in remote areas where it is not always possible to keep tab on possible malpractices by the staff, including re-use of syringes. We will test them at the dispensaries and then introduce them in the hospitals.â€™â€™

The move, he added, would provide additional safeguards against possible transmission of viruses like HIV and those of hepatitis B and C. It could prove to be of immense help in the state governmentâ€™s initiatives to control the spread of these diseases.

Two varieties of syringes, one with 5 ml capacity and another with 2 ml capacity, have been procured at a total cost of about Rs 9 lakh.

The present lot of syringes, Baishya said, will be used for BCG vaccination. â€˜â€˜The supply was received late last month and will soon be distributed among the designated dispensaries. We need about 600 syringes per month per dispensary,â€™â€™ he added.

9,Secretariat officials collect condoms incognito,"NEW DELHI: The peculiar condom-picking habits of Delhi government employees have come as an eye-opener for health department officials. Over 1,500 free condoms were picked up by sarkari babus in just two days. The condoms were picked up during trials of free distribution in the Secretariat by Delhi AIDS Control Society recently.

The exercise not only shed light on the babusâ€™ inclination to safe sex, but also revealed their aversion to collecting condoms in public view.

â€˜â€˜When we kept the condom cartons in toilets, they vanished in no time. But fewer condoms were collected by people when we kept the cartons in offices,â€™â€™ said an official of the Society. He added: â€˜â€˜Since condoms are generally associated with sex, people feel embarrassed picking them up in public.â€™â€™

Several senior officials preferred to skirt the issue when asked about thedistribution of condoms in office. One even defended the high demand for condoms in the Secretariat: â€˜â€˜It is like any public-dealing office where visitors use a free facility.â€™â€™

Deputy director (condoms) in the Society, Piyush Jain, said: â€˜â€˜We are trying to fight off the â€˜â€˜stigmaâ€™â€™ attached with condoms. Banners have been put up in the Secretariat to publicise the free distribution and make people treat condoms like any other household article.â€™â€™

â€˜â€˜The response to banners has been phenomenal. We are exhausting our stocks twice as fast without the banners. We are distributing about 4,000 condoms here every month,â€™â€™ said Jain.

Buoyed by the response, the health department is now planning to open condom vending points on all the 10 floors of the Secretariat. And officials are going to make special provision in toilets. The banners announcing the free distribution are all over the offices of health department officials on the 9th floor. â€˜â€˜Even women employees are coming forward. And nobody is blushing,â€™â€™ said a man sitting at a vending point on the 9th floor.

â€˜â€˜The convenient location of condom vending points saves women employees a lot of the embarrassment. They are taking away the condoms without any hesitation,â€™â€™ he said.
