0,Jammu bandh against Musharraf visit,"jammu: jammu observed a bandh on saturday to coincide with the visit of pakistan president gen pervez musharraf. the bandh, called by the people's initiative for peace and unity (pipu), was partial. though businesses and transport were largely hit, banks remained open and government offices functioned, though with depleted attendance. the educational institutions are already closed on account of summer holidays. the pipu is made up of the panun kashmir, the jammu joint students federation and the ladakh buddhist association, which favour reorganisation of the state as a solution to the kashmir problem. the bandh call was given mainly on two counts: that kashmir should not be discussed as it is an internal issue and that the spreading out of the red carpet to musharraf is an ``insult'' to the indian martyrs of kargil and the widows and orphans left by it.
