0,Anti-collision devices can be modified to detect train fires',"MUMBAI: Ninety-three per cent of rail casualties that have occurred in the past five years could have been prevented had there been anti-collision devices (ACDs) installed in trains, according to B. Rajaram, managing director of the Konkan Railway Corporation. While the ACD's function is to primarily help avoid train collisions, smoke detectors installed on the ACD could also help give early warnings and stop trains in case of fires, like on last week's ill-fated Golden Temple Mail, Mr Rajaram explains. In an interview with TNN,Mr Rajaram, an engineering expert who holds the patent for inventing the ACD, discusses railway safety. Excerpts: What is the reason for the increasing number of rail accidents in the past few years? Rail accidents occur because of human failure or malfunction of some material or equipment.Analysis shows that a large number of them can be blamed on human failure.The maximum number of accidents are collisions and derailments. Fires account for the second highest number of accidents, costing about 200 lives in the past 10 years. To minimise accident damage, the ministry has cleared ACDs for installation along 3,339 km of routes covering different railway zones, like North Frontier, Southern, South Central and Northern. Survey reports of another 10,000 km are being prepared. Hopefully, by the end of the year, trains running along about 13,000 km of the 63,000 km network will have ACDs. How does the ACD work? ACDs are powerful knowledge-embedded devices that have direct control of the braking system. The train can also be stopped by anyone by simply pressing two buttons simultaneously on the ACD.When two trains are within 3 km of each other, the ACDs of each train communicate with each other, and based on inputs from global positioning systems the trains brake automatically to prevent an accident. The device has been tested over four years and is now ready for full-scale commercial use. Why do accidents occur and how does one prevent them? Let me tell you that the accident ratio on the Indian Railways is quite low, despite its huge area of operationsâ€”this is also compared to other countries, including the US where road vehicles continually keep ramming into trains. The very fact that the ACD has been invented in India shows that we take serious note of the frailties in the system. After the Golden Temple Mail fire, I've been thinking that we can extend the functionality of ACDs to prevent fire as well. We can install smoke detectors that communicate through the wireless with the ACDs,which would help stop trains. We'll propose this to the ministry. And one more thing: only fire-retardant material should be used on trains. Do you think a freeze on recruitments has affected train maintenance work? No. If the railways are running short of people, it may compromise on secondary areas like cleaning, but not on primary areas like maintenance and safety. The railway system is not negligent. It carries one crore passengers every day. There are severe checks each train has to go through before being certified fit. Nobody will put his neck on the line by certifying slipshod work. About 1,000 people are involved in the running and safety of each train. There is a general impression that accident inquiry reports and internal safety reports fizzle out after the shock of a mishap dies and none of these reports are acted upon. That's not true. People are punished. It's just that this is not highlighted adequately in the media. At the end of the day, the railways want solutions.We look at how other systems work and exchange technological knowledge with the UIC (International Union of Railways) to strive for improvement. It would be unfair to say the railways are not sensitive.Moreover, passengers too need to be more aware. They should learn not to carry kerosene on board. The white smoke that emanated from the Golden Temple Mail fire points to kerosene and not a short circuit. Passengers should not indulgte in unsafe practices on board, such as making tea on a stove.When tea-vendors are pushed out by policemen, it's sad that some passengers protest against it.

1,Quacks thrive as govt drive fails to deliver,"NEW DELHI: When Nanku, a juice vendor in Chirag Dilli developed fever last week, he went to the local ""Bengali doctor"". The doctor, qualified only to give ayurvedic medicine allegedly prescribed allopathic medication. By Saturday, Nanku was dead. His relatives registered a complaint with the Malviya Nagar police station, but the police washed its hands off any responsibility. They said they could not prosecute the doctor for medical negligence as Nanku was suffering from pneumonia, which can at times prove fatal. But if the police were to refer to the Supreme Court definition of quackery, the story would have been different. According to the apex court: ""A person who studies one system of medicine but practices another is a quack."" The government's anti-quackery drive is almost four years old but no tangible results yet, despite compulsory registration. A practising allopathic doctor should register with the Delhi Medical Council. Ayurvedic doctors need to be registered with the Bhartiya Ayurvedic Chikitsa Parishad and homoeopathic doctors should be registered with the homoeopathic board. City health minister A K Walia said registration was made mandatory to check quackery. ""There have been cases where the father did the MBBS but the son was continuing in his name,"" he said. Two years back, a person was arrested by the Central Bureau of Investigation for selling fake degrees such as MBBS, BAMS, RMP, for as little as Rs 500 to Rs 1,000. He used to openly give advertisements in the name of the Delhi Degree College. By the time he was arrested, he had reportedly sold 40,000 fake degrees. There is more. In April last year, the decomposed body of a woman was found in a clinic in New Ashok Nagar. The doctor, whose clinic was named 'Das Bengali clinic' fled after the woman died. Two weeks back, chief medical officer with NDMC, Dr Anil Bansal, received a patient with an infection in one of his legs. ""He had been suffering from a boil and had gone to a quack who operated on it. The infection spread and his whole leg had to be amputated,"" he said. Bansal, who is also the Delhi Medical Association president said the menace persists despite the government claim that they are taking action.

2,Rising incidents of abduction worry BJP leaders,"PATNA: The BJP and its state Vyavasayee Manch president Suresh Rungta have expressed their deep concern over the rise in the incidence of kidnapping of traders, lawyers, doctors and engineers in Bihar and demanded immediate release of trader Sanjay Dayal and Dr Ramesh Chandra. BJP's state vice-president and spokesperson Kiran Ghai said that from recent incidents it appears that the state government has completely surrendered before the criminals. The latter, in fact, enjoyed the patronage of the state government. She demanded that the state government and the police should take the kidnapping of Dr Chandra seriously and take effective steps for his safe release, as was done for the release of photo-journalist Ashok Karn, trader Janki Singh and Dr Bharat Singh. Both Ghai and Rungta threatened of mass agitation if the kidnapped persons are not released from the kidnappers' clutches and recurrence of such incidents is not stopped. Rungta also demanded a compensation of Rs 20 lakh to the family of deceased trader Anil Gupta of Bikram.

Some of the members of complainant party are also named accused in the murder case of former RJD minister Rajendra Rai's son. Police sources said, on conditions of anonymity, that the warrants of arrest obtained from the CJM court would have to be surrendered or returned in the court on the pretext that accused persons are absconding.

4,Lack of vaccines hits farmers,"PATNA: With the Institute of Animal Health and Production (IAHP), Patna, yet to resume production of bacterial vaccines, farmers having livestock are facing a lot of hardships to get them at affordable prices. The institute had stopped producing bacterial vaccines for dreaded diseases like anthrax (enlargement of spleen leading to bleeding from natural orifice), haemorrhagic septecemia (HS) or galaghontu and black quarter (BQ) or langri about seven years back. While the vaccine for anthrax is not available in the market at all, one dose of vaccine for HS and BQ is available in the market at a cost of over Rs 300. The Jharkhand government is producing the vaccine. The IAHP had stopped producing bacterial vaccines in 1996 as two important instruments, autoclave and boiler, of the manufacturing plant had developed snags which could not be rectified. Since then the government kept making a budgetary provision for the purchase of the two equipment. But, the plan fund lapsed every year due to the failure of the animal husbandry department (AHD) to finalise the purchase. Meanwhile, the cost of the two machines has continued to escalate. Since 1996 all the animal husbandry directors, four of them were IAS officers had made effort to purchase the two machines but they miserably failed in their attempts. The animal husbandry director, Dr Dhurkhlei Ram, told TNN that the department could not purchase the two machines for want of adequate number of bidders or due to some technical reasons. Ram, while admitting that the AHD had to surrender the Rs. 23 lakh during the last financial year, said that the department would soon submit a Rs. 25-lakh project before the Empowered Committee regarding the purchase of the two machines. A senior official of the department, however, said that the project would also have to be cleared by the finance department. Ram said that the government would be able to purchase the two machines during the current financial year enabling the IAHP to resume production of the bacterial vaccine. The general secretary of the Bihar Veterinary Association (BVA), Dr Dharmendra Sinha, however, said that that the during the last financial year the AHD did not purchase the two machine despite recommendation of the technical committee. The central purchase committee of the department had rejected the recommendation of the technical committee, he said. Now the department would invite a fresh tender for the purchase of the two instruments. Sinha said that till 1995, the bacterial vaccine used to be available to the people at all the veterinary hospitals of the state at a very very cheap price. The HS and BQ vaccines used to be available at a price of just Re. 1 only, he said. Replying to a query, Ram said that every district required about 10,000 doses of bacterial vaccines annually. He said that the IAHP would start producing at least 2 lakh doses of the vaccines every year once it had acquired new autoclave and boiler.

5,Experts decry gender violence,"JEHANABAD: Women comprise half of humanity, yet it is rarely acknowledged that violence against women, many of whom are brutalised from cradle to grave simply because of their gender, is the most pervasive human rights violation in the world today. Making this observation while inaugurating a workshop on ""Protection of women's rights"", organised by the Bihar State Legal Services Authority in the Abdul Bari Town Hall here on Sunday, Justice Nagendra Rai of the Patna High Court said that in India too, where women were once worshipped, violation of women's right has assumed a gigantic proportion. He said that the Indian Constitution had in-built safeguards against gender discrimination. In keeping with Constitutional mandate, several legislations have been passed in Parliament and state assemblies, according equal status to women in society and providing for deterrent punishments to the offenders, he said, adding over the past one decade gender discrimination has also gained currency on the international level with its recognition as a human rights issue. Landing the role of the State Legal Services authority in creating awareness of the rights of women, Rai maintained that implementation of women's rights must start with the educ-ation of girls. Their unequal access to education is one of the most fundamental abridgements of human rights and one that perpetuates their weakened position, making them vulnerable to oppression and ultimately to violence, he said. Dwelling at length on the rights of women including acts for their welfare, district and sessions judge Sudhansu K Lal underscored the need to involve ferent segments of society, including the judiciary, the media, the educator, government and non-government agencies and above all, the women organisations in spreading awareness of women's rights. Jehanabd district magistrate Santosh Kumar Mall, while welcoming the guests, said that gender violence is also a major health and development issue with powerful implications for coming generations as well as society in general. Without eliminating gender apartheid, the very notion of human progress is merely a fantasy, he remarked. A large number of women, mostly teachers, panchayat representatives and Anganwari workers attended the workshop. Justice Rajendra Prasad, Patna High Court, Ghan Shyam Prasad, member-secretary of the State Legal Services Authority and H Rehman, field publicity officer, government of India addressed the workshop. Siyaram Sharma, president of the district Bar Association proposed a vote of thanks.

6,Man arrested for impersonating student,"NEW DELHI: A 21-year-old man was arrested for impersonating a student in the medical entrance examination on Sunday morning. Vashisth Narain was apprehended by the superintendent (examination), N K Sehgal, at the Hansraj College where the entrance test for MBBS and BDS was held. The officer caught him after noticing that the photograph on the identity card was not his. Narain took the exam on behalf of Abhas Mittal, a resident of Rohini. Deputy commissioner of police (north) Sanjay Baniwal said: ""We are yet to question Mittal. A team was sent to his home after Narain was produced in the court."" He added that Narain, a resident of Kota, received Rs 50,000 for taking the exam. Narain and Mittal met each other through a middleman, Ajay, the police said. ""Ajay is still absconding,"" Baniwal said. According to him, Ajay met Narain in Kota where the accused was attending coaching classes. ""Narain has himself flunked several entrance exams. While attending coaching classes, Narain got introduced to Ajay who lured him to take the exam,"" Baniwal said. Ajay has apparently incited more unemployed youths to take exams on behalf of students.

7,Four held for violence in municipal by-poll,"PUNE: Minor violence marred the municipal by-election to the Rasta Peth powerhouse panel (ward A), with workers of the Republican Party of India (Athawale) and the Shiv Sena clashing on Sunday morning. Three people sustained minor injuries in the incident, which, interestingly, happened at the Pudumjee police chowki. The Samarth police have arrested four people in this connection and booked a few others. The other by-poll, in ward C of the Maharana Pratap Udyan panel passed off peacefully. While the former registered a 39.11 voter turnout, the latter recorded 25.97 per cent. It may be recalled that polls in both the wards had to be ordered following the deaths of sitting corporators â€” BJP corporator Satish Misal from the Maharana Pratap Udyan ward was shot dead, while Sena corporator Chhaya Mayekar died in a stove blast. The nature of their deaths had led to apprehension about violence in Sunday's by-poll. According to a complaint registered by the Samarth police, trouble started when former municipal standing committee chairman Anis Sundke the RPI and his supporters went the Pudumjee police chowki, complaining that they were being followed by some Sena men. Sundke's mother, Shameem, is contesting the poll on an RPI ticket. Sure enough, some Sena workers also reached the chowki, which led to the brawl. Those arrested are: Hemant Kachare of Nana Peth, Nachiket Kothawale Somwar Peth, Paresh Bhoi of Budhwar Peth and Shailesh Bhokare of Nana Peth. Those injured are: Parshuram Wadekar of Dapodi, Asif Yakub of Nana Peth and Asif Sattar of Bhawani Peth. In a counter-complaint, Ajit Malekar (33) of Rasta Peth, son of Vatsala Malekar, who is contesting the poll on Shiv Sena ticket, alleged that Anis Sundke threatened him and his mother 1 am, when they were holding a meeting with Sena workers. Sundke and his friend threatened him with a revolver before leaving,Malekar further alleged.

9,Delayed justice makes mockery of law: Ex-CJI,"BANGALORE: Former Chief Justice of India Justice Y V Chandrachud said on Sunday that the Indian law is rigid and is more in dispensation of injustice than justice. ""Delays in justice only make nonsense of law,"" he added. Delivering a lecture on - Impact of law on day-to-day lives -organised by Samvaada here on Sunday, Justice Chandrachud said that law for the common man must reflect the intimate relation with man's conscience. ""The law merely reflects the essence of life and since life itself is not static, the law has unfortunately not changed,"" said Justice Chandrachud, who has been associated with law and its working for over 60 years. While explaining that the wheels of law reforms grind slowly, he said politicians were not interested in reforming the law, moreover in appointing good judges. ""The domination of caste-based politics has created a chasm between law-makers and life today. It is now a Herculean task for the Constitution to reduce this gap,"" he said, adding that life dominated by undercurrent politics should be looked into seriously. ""Better the judge, more the chance that government orders will be set aside,"" the former CJI felt, adding that criminal law needs more reforms compared to civil law. Stating the events leading to the convictions for assassins of Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi which took nearly five years each, Justice Chandrachud said the common man loses faith in the importance and impact of law by such delays.

10,Broadcast policy on anvil,"NEW DELHI: The government has decided to formulate a comprehensive broadcast policy in view of the massive expansion of satellite television and private FM radio. At a meeting convened by the information and broadcasting ministry recently in connection with a Parliament question, some participants wanted to know why no such policy existed. During the discussion, it was pointed out that the convergence Bill itself was an expression of the government's intent in this regard. In fact, the need for a broadcast policy was being felt only because the Bill had been mired in numerous amendments proposed by members of a parlimentary committee which had examined it. Ministry sources later confirmed that a draft of the policy was ready and views were being sought before it was finally adopted. One official ascribed the absence of such a policy to the long government monopoly over broadcasting. ""So long we have been guided by the 1885 Telegraph Act, where was the need for such a policy?"" he asked. But the technological explosion of recent years has necessiated such a policy. ""A policy has become urgent because we have been overtaken by technology,"" a participant said. The fact that in addition to a 100-odd existing television channels, some 10 more are in the pipeline awaiting government clearance is a reflection of the television revolution's magnitude. Nearly 50 per cent of these are 24-hour news channels. With fierce competition has come a tendency to extend the frontier of news, often calling for caution and restraint. When the government invites bids for another 70 FM radio stations later this year, broadcasting in the country will enter an exciting phase. Chaired by I&B minister Ravi Shanker Prasad, the meeting was attended by top officials of the ministry and its wings.

14,US team inquires about state's conversion law,"GANDHINAGAR/AHMEDABAD: A delegation of officials from the US State Department came calling here on Monday making direct and discreet inquiries about the Freedom of Religion Act, 2003, passed in the Gujarat state assembly recently. The visit caused some consternation in the Narendra Modi administration as the delegation met some leaders of the minority community too, apart from the meetings that were held with the state government officials. The delegation was led by Diana Barnes, foreign affairs officer in the US State Department, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, Labour and Office of International Religious Freedom. She was accompanied by J Amick, vice-consul, economic affairs, American consulate, Mumbai, and Arundhati Mundalay, political officer in the American consulate. They inquired from top state government officials on implementation of the new law and possibilities of it being misused, leading to human rights violations. Barnes and her team met principal secretary (home) K C Kapoor, among others, only to be told that the law was meant to ""safeguard"" the backward sections of society from being lured or forcibly converted into another religion. Barnes, who is likely to submit a report to the US State Department on Gujarat's religious situation shortly, however, refused to speak to the media. She also held a meeting in Ahmedabad with NGOs, especially from the Christian community, which has reacted with dismay over the new law on conversions. Meanwhile, it is reliably learnt, the law banning forcible conversions is yet to be made effective, though it was published in the state gazetteer. ""A notification putting it into operation will have to be issued after the rules for it are finalised,"" said an official. The rules have been drafted and sent to the Advocate General for clearance. Till date, the draft rules are mum over whether Buddhist, Jain or Sikh priests would need to take permission from the district magistrate, as stipulated in the Act, to perform the rites to convert someone. ""Why should they? The personal laws clearly consider Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism as part of Hinduism,"" said state law minister Ashok Bhatt. But added a senior official, ""The rules will merely say how long the district magistrate should take to give such permission. It will spell out the method for conversion, nothing more, but cannot identify the faiths that would need such permission.""

15,Sainiks stage protest outside adman's house,"MUMBAI: Upset over ad guru Alyque Padamsee choosing to call the city Bombay, 150 Shiv Sainiks demonstrated outside his Warden Road residence. Mr Padamsee had been quoted in Monday's edition of 'Saamna', the Shiv Sena mouthpiece, as saying that he lived in Bombay not Mumbai. When this newspaper called Mr Padamsee's home in the evening,he had left for Kolkata and could not be contacted. A group of Sena activists from south Mumbai went to Mr Padamsee's home to reprimand him. According to Shiv Sena sources, Mr Padamsee told them that what was reported in 'Saamna'was a mistake and that he had no intention of offending anybody. The Sainiks then left after warning him to be more careful'' in future. No case has been registered against the Sainiks. The Sena's demonstrations against Mr Padamsee were said to be a part of the party's 'Mee-Mumbaikar' (I am a Mumbaikar) crusade. The term 'Mumbai' evokes the city's ancient glory before the advent of the East India Company. 'Mumbai' thus has a deeper and richer socio-cultural context. Mr Padamsee should learn to respect the aspirations of local inhabitants,'' a senior Sena leader told TNN. Madras is known as Chennai and Calcutta as Kolkata. However, the elite few in Mumbai have been insisting on using the colonial name-plate of this great city,'' the Sena leader added. Meanwhile, the Sena has intensified its 'Mee-Mumbaikar' crusade. The party has undertaken a series of programmes to clean up parks and maidans in the city.
