0,Bitta roots for 'national govt' to save India,"kolkata: he had seen it all, from very close quarters. former youth congress president and hardcore politico m.s. bitta is now a man with an apolitical mission. immediately after the kargil skirmishes, bitta decided that politics was leading nowhere and went on to launch his all india anti-terrorism front. as chairman of aiatf, bitta is now touring all over india to garner support for his fledgling organisation. ""after having dabbled in politics for so many years, i now realise that only a national government can save this country,"" bitta told tnn. it is the recent attack on policemen in front of the american center, that has bought bitta to the city. the former youth congress president, who is still high on the terrorists'' hit list, has already escaped nine attempts on his life. he would like to build the aiatf as a disciplined, uniformed force, following the ideals of netaji subhash chandra bose. bitta is talking to union home and defence ministries so that aiatf recruits could be given arms training by some government agency. ""we are not into play-acting like the vhp or bajrang dal. we want to raise a serious, disciplined force to combat terrorism and political terrorism,"" explained bitta. despite his support for chief minister buddhadeb bhattacharjee''s stand on terrorism, bitta pointed out that five policemen had to die in front of the american center on 22 january largely because of state government''s short-sightedness. ""west bengal lacks in security preparedness. it is easy to create terror here. the police needs training and orientation to combat terrorists,"" bitta rattled off his prescription. and all these cannot be done under the existing political set up because the leaders are more busy guarding their chairs than thinking about the country.

6,CPM evicted under new rules: Govt,"new delhi: much as the cpi-m and the safdar hashmi memorial trust (sahmat) would like the world to believe that their eviction from two flats in the capital''s vitthalbhai patel house about two weeks ago was politically motivated, facts suggest otherwise. the party had managed to retain the accommodation after reaching an arrangement with the urban development ministry and having these flats allotted to party mp s r pillai. this, even though pillai â€” a member of the upper house â€” should have sought accommodation from the rajya sabha housing committee. as for claims by sahmat that it was the government''s target, the ministry spokesperson said: ""the eviction notices were issued to the cpi-m and not sahmat. the allotment had been made to the party and the sahmat''s occupation of the premises was unauthorised."" according to highly placed sources in the urban development ministry, the eviction was part of the action taken to evict various political parties from government accommodation after the framing of new guidelines as ordered by the supreme court. with the new guidelines in place, the government has managed to reduce from 44 to 31 the number of premises occupied by political parties. sources said since the new guidelines, approved by the cabinet committee on accommodation (cca), came into being, other political parties including the congress and the bjp have vacated accommodation they were no longer entitled to. both the congress and bjp have vacated 16 premises though the congress continues to occupy three premises illegally, said ministry sources. eviction, however, hasn''t been possible since all three are presently under litigation, sources added. according to the revised guidelines, parties with more than 50 mps but less than 150 mps are entitled to two single-room units in v p house for their parliamentary staff. here again, the cpi-m did not fulfil the criteria. the party claims the occupation of premises by sahmat isn''t unauthorised ""since no money transaction has taken place"". besides, delhi cpi-m general secretary pushpinder grewal claimed the ""government arbitrarily decided to change its guidelines and we had objected to this.""

7,Jharkhand HC puts state govt in a tight spot,"ranchi: the jharkhand government is caught in an unenviable position with the judiciary in jharkhand having taken up the onus to show the way to the state government and its machinery. in the past one and a half years, the jharkhand high court has passed severe strictures against the government at least a dozen times --apparently frustrated with its failure to provide basic infrastructural facilities to its people, including clean drinking water, and also lack of coordination between departments. recently, the judiciary even had to give directions to the government on how to manage traffic on one of the busiest thoroughfares of the state capital. this is just a small example of the government''s lack of vision, an opposition leader commented. this is not all. the court has also found some officials guilty of giving false information to it. following this, officials were asked to record their statements under oath in the jharkhand high court recently in connection with a public interest litigation on road construction. this, according to legal experts, was certainly a rare, if not unusual, phenomenon. experts opined that if officials concerned did not comply with the statements given in court, the consequences could be serious. in a situation where the chief minister and the speaker of the state assembly are accepting the government''s failure on various fronts, including development, there is no option left but for the judiciary to step in, said deputy advocate-general binod poddar. the repeated intervention by the judiciary has, however, not gone down well with the legislature. speaker inder singh namdhari has said that the judiciary overstepped its limits on some occasions. if the nose on our faces grows a foot longer, it defaces the personality rather than enhancing it, namdhari has said in an article published in a local daily referring to stepped up judicial activism. speaking to this correspondent, namdhari questioned the need for the high court to give a stay in a matter where a privilege motion had been served on the chairman of the damodar valley corporation (dvc). the entire house had taken a resolution, which said that the stay was uncalled for, the speaker said. the legislature respects the judiciary and it should also be vice-versa, he said.

9,Training for lawyers mooted,"ahmedabad: leading judges from across the country have emphasised on training for judges and advocates to speed up disposal of cases to deal with the huge backlog of cases before the courts in gujarat. ""unless there is proper training for advocates and judges, it is very difficult to stop lengthy litigation,"" remarked supreme court justice m b shah, who was here to participate in a function organised by gujarat state legal services authority on sunday. he stressed on the need for court management and observed that just appointing more judges and public prosecutors will not solve the problem of pending cases. lashing out at the slow pace of reforms in the judicial system, shah said there is no keenness or desire to revitalise the system, and asked judges to work honestly to show results. he added that even though judges are disciplined, there was a lot of scope for ''being punctual'' when it comes to disposing of the cases. gujarat high court chief justice d m dharmadhikari also observed that due to delay in the justice delivery system, litigants have stopped approaching courts. quoting a previous incident, he said in india the age of litigation is more than the age of litigant. ""it is high time we give a thought to it (reforms),"" he said. appreciating the efforts taken by gujarat legal services authority, he said alternative dispute resolution was a ray of hope for early disposal of cases. ""docket control and court management are also required for speedy disposal, but we are not using these techniques,"" he said. emphasising upon alternative dispute resolution system, he also said litigation should not travel beyond the area from where it was generated. executive chairman of the authority justice j n bhatt remarked that common man''s access to justice was extremely difficult if not impossible. ""planning, management, research and development, and comprehensive training package are the four fundamental requisites for quick justice delivery system,"" he said. justice bhatt further added that population to judge ratio in india is 10,00,000:13 whereas ideally it should not be less than 65. the conviction rate in the criminal justice system has also gone below 7 per cent, sending bad signals to society and potential criminals, he said.

10,BJP may come third in 2nd phase of polls,"new delhi: the second phase of polling is being held in uttar pradesh monday, covering 145 assembly constituencies spread over the three regions of western up, bundelkhand and central up. if the trends of the past lok sabha election were to be repeated, monday''s election would see a surge in the performance of the samajwadi party, which was left trailing in the exit polls conducted after the first phase of polls. monday''s election is also the toughest for the bjp. in the 1996 assembly election, the bjp, the sp and the bsp polled 34 per cent, 27 per cent and 22 per cent of the popular vote respectively which very closely resembles the relative strengths of the three parties in the state as a whole in that election. in the 1999 lok sabha election, the sp and the bsp marginally gained in votes, while the bjp was the sole loser in this election with the bjp, sp and the bsp registering vote shares of 31, 28 and 23 per cent respectively. in terms of seats, the sp led in as many as 59 seats in the 1999 lok sabha election, followed by the bjp (38 seats) and the bsp (36 seats). if the bjp were to receive a major setback in this entire election, it would here in monday''s polls. even a marginal negative swing of 2 per cent in votes since the last lok sabha election would see the party finishing as a poor third with a tally of just 28 seats out of 145 in contention, with the sp topping the tally with about 68 seats and the bsp 38 seats. the exit polls in the first phase of polling had placed the sp a distant second and predicted about 26 seats for the samajwadi party. monday''s polls may well see the sp tally nearing the 100 mark, leaving the bjp behind by at least 20 seats. if the sp fails to win a minimum of 90 seats in the first two phases (in the real count, not in exit polls), it may not be able to cross the 155 seats mark, a tally which the times poll by drs had predicted for the party. for the bjp, ajit singh''s party cannot add much to its performance in this phase. the bjp''s own performance will be on test in monday''s polls. if the bjp combine fails to retain its lead over the sp in the two phases taken together, which is almost an impossible task, the party may be certain to finish behind the sp in overall performance, which is what the times poll by drs had predicted.

11,Caste tags matter most in UP polls,"etah: a lunch-break discussion among lawyers and munshis at the district court here on the current polls turns hot. anil gupta, a bania advocate, asserts that rajnath singh will get another term, gulab singh, a jaatav lawyer, says it will be mayawati, and naresh singh, a yadav munshi, declares mulayam singh yadav to be the frontrunner. will only the caste of the leader and the castes / groups the party represents decide voting? no, says gupta. ""in addition to the leaderâ€™s caste, this time, the candidateâ€™s caste will be a crucial factor."" indeed, though castes and pre-poll defections have plagued up polls during the past decade, this time around, these two factors have assumed such proportions that this makes not just an ""issueless"" but also a ""partyless"" poll. all the major parties, barring the congress, are seen to represent a caste/religious grouping - the bjp (upper castes), the samajwadi party (yadavs and muslims), and the bahujan samaj party (jaatavs). even the new players like the rashtriya lok dal and the indian lok dal (jats), the rashtriya kranti party (the lodhi rajputs), the apna dal (kurmis), the national loktantrik party (muslims) are seen as playing the game. besides, parties confident about base vote have fielded candidates from castes not part of their traditional vote bank. this has confused voters so much that caste organisations in many places have decided to vote on caste and not party lines. in bareilly, the brahmin mahasabha opted for the congressâ€™ anil sharma instead of the bjpâ€™s rajesh aggarwal; in khurja, the vaish sabha decided to go for the rkpâ€™s sanjiv aggarwal and not the bjp to protest former energy minister naresh aggarwalâ€™s expulsion. accompanying the ""changing"" caste equations, as professor jp rawat of aligarh muslim university notes, is the movement of many candidates to new parties after their own outfits denied them the ticket. thus, in sambhal, ex-bjp mla vp tyagi is the inldâ€™s choice because the rld is fielding mangu tyagi, also ex-bjp.

13,Kerala govt to move HC against Lokayukta order,"thiruvananthapuram: the kerala government on monday decided to file a writ appeal in the high court against the state lokayukta order asking the government to hold dialogue with the striking employees and teachers to settle the stir that has entered the 13th day paralysing the entire official machinery. addressing a press conference after a special cabinet meeting that reviewed the ongoing strike, chief minister a k antony said the cabinet discussed the lokayukta order and as it was not acceptable, the government decided to challenge the same in the high court. lokayukta in its order based on press reports on the strike on february 15 had directed the striking employees to end the stir considering the financial crisis in the state and asked the government to hold talks to find a solution. in the present circumstances it was not possible for the government to accept the demands of the employees, he said. the government had not cut any rights of the employees, antony said, adding the leave surrender was not a right, but it was only an allowance sanctioned when the government''s financial position was good. in a state where thousands of educated youth come forward to do even the job of sweeping, it was unfortunate that the employees, getting a regular income, were not ready for a small sacrifice, he said. antony expressed optimism that government''s austerity measures would have the support of the people.
