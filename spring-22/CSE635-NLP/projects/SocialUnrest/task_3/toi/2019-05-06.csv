0,Insurance corporation for farmers,"BANGALORE: The Centre will set up a National Farmers Insurance Corporation (NFIC) to protect farmers from the vagaries of nature and the market.

Addressing agriculture and horticulture ministers of the coconut-growing states here, Singh said senior officials of the Union Agriculture and Finance ministries are working out the modalities of the proposed corporation. ``The blue print should come out during the ongoing session of Parliament,'''' he added.

Emphasising the need to bring in agricultural reforms, Singh said there are several laws in cooperation and agricultural marketing which are hindrances to progress of farmers. ``It is high time obsolete and oppressive laws are removed and agriculture is made free of legal and bureaucratic hassles,'''' he said.

It is proposed to amend the Cooperative Act to provide funds directly to cooperative societies rather than the present system of routing through the state government. ``I am optimistic the multi-state Cooperative bill aimed at bringing meaningful changes in the sector will be passed in the present session.''''

According to Singh, the Centre proposes to train 5,000 agriculture graduates annually in agri-clinics and help them set up agriculture business. Directing state governments to decentralise procurement of agri-crops, he permitted Karnataka to start procuring copra from farmers immediately but at last year''s Minimum Support Price (MSP). ``As and when the Centre announces the MSP for the current year, the amount can be adjusted,'''' he added.

Stating that farmers could not be blamed for surplus food production, Singh said it is the primary responsibility of the government to arrange for the distribution of food grains and provide remunerative prices to the farmers. ``I compliment the Indian farmers for producing a record 211 million tons of food grains this year despite many hurdles,'''' he said.

1,CPI plans protest rallies this month,"MANGALORE: The Communist Party of India will organise a series of rallies, dialogues and protests this month to create a public opinion on the issues that have resulted in worsening fundamentalist tendencies and falling economic standards.

Briefing reporters here, state secretary of the party, Dr Siddhana Gowda Patil said, the situation in Gujarat was a clear indication of the the state sponsored fundamentalist movement in which the central government had a large role to play especially in the genocide of minorities.

Patil said the first world countries have started to feel that the communal situation in Gujarat was nothing but fascism.

``The Centre should take drastic measures to curb the communal ill-feelings among the majority and the minorities in the state, failing which, it could spread to other states which will be an ultimate disaster for the country,'''' he added.

2,New govt policy hits aged,"KOLHAPUR: Political vengeance seems to be taking its toll on the Matoshri vruddhashram here. The future of around 30 inmates of the vruddhashram hangs in balance, thanks to a new Democratic Front government policy that reduces financial assistance to all Matoshri homes for the aged in the state. The Kolhapur Matoshri vruddhashram is the only home for the aged in the state which is run by a womenâ€™s organisation, the Siddhai Mahila Mandal (SMM). Spread across a 5-acre plot at Nagdewadi, the vruddhashram has a capacity to house 100 inmates. The Shiv Sena-BJP government, which started these vruddhashrams, used to issue a grant of Rs 750 per inmate and rs 1 lakh annually for staff salaries. â€œHowever, the present government has reduced the grant to Rs 335 per senior citizen, which is chicken feed vis-Ã vis the actual expenses,â€� said chairperson of the mahila mandal, Vaishali Bhudkar. The annual expenditure on the vruddhashram was Rs 8 lakh, with each inmate needing Rs 1,250, she said. â€œLast financial year, we were given an annual grant of Rs 3.91 lakh. However, from March 31, 2002, even this has been stopped,â€� Dhudkar claimed. This despite government representatives ensuring that transparency is maintained in the vruddhashramâ€™s administration. Kolhapur zilla parishadâ€™s social welfare officer Hambirrao Kamble confirmed that the vruddhashram had received an annual grant of Rs 3.91 lakh last year, but said â€œfuture grants depend solely on the governmentâ€™s mood.â€� But the NGOs running these homes are not ready to take the governmentâ€™s orders lying down.A meeting of the NGOs in March decided to resist the move. The NGOs will meet again on May 26 in Kolhapur to take a final decision in this concern.

3,Jolt to minister as ‘samadhi’ loses civic poll,"GAYA: The defeat of Deepan Yadav, the samadhi (daughter''s father in-law) of the RJD strongman and muscle-flexing minister of state Surindra Prasad Yadav, from ward no 4 of the Gaya Municipal Corporation has delivered a major blow to the somewhat declining political fortune of the mantriji who shot into national limelight by tearing the Women Reservation Bill in the Lok Sabha. Surindra Yadav left no strings unpulled to get his samadhi elected.

To add insult to the minister''s injury, three of his known detractors have made it to the municipal corporation. The victory of his detractors means that Surindra''s grip in his fiefdom is on the decline and the challenge is coming from within as two of his victorious detractors are Yadavs. Jitendra Yadav alias Bachu Yadav, the alleged gangster who all through the nineties defied Surindra in Gaya town to emerge as a parallel centre of power, was elected unopposed.

Another known detractor whose victory must have caused loss of sleep to Surindra Yadav is Sanjay Yadav, son of Mahesh Singh Yadav, the RJD MlA from the Konch assembly constituency of Gaya district. There is no love lost between Surindra Yadav and Mahesh Singh Yadav, who made a public display of their fire-power outside the Rampur police station on January 1, 2000.

Sanjay Yadav is now being projected as a formidable candidate for the post of Gaya mayor.

The psychological impact of Sanjay Yadav''s victory is likely to be more pronounced for Surindra Yadav as Sanjay Yadav lives in the same locality where the minister of state lives and holds his durbar. The fact that Sanjay won the election despite the minister''s opposition from the area regarded as Surindra''s fiefdom, does not augur well for the political future of controversial minister who is already battling it out with the Ranvir Sena. Fighting simultaneously on too many fronts is not going to be easy for Surindra.

If the defeat of his samadhi and the victory of Bachhu Yadav and Sanjay Yadav was not enough, Renuka Palit, wife of Jai Kumar Palit, too won the election from ward no 18. Palit and Surindra have never seen eye to eye and even after Palit''s defection from the Congress to join the Laloo bandwagon, the Surindra-Palit equation is far from smooth.

Before the Gaya Municipal Corporation elections, Surindra Yadav''s opponents did well in the panchayat elections and Bindi Yadav, another challenger to Surindra Yadav''s authority among the Gaya businessmen who have to cough up heavy donations every now and then, managed to win the prized post of the chairman of the district board.

But those who know Surindra Yadav say that the big Yadav, after the municipal corporation result may be down but he cannot be written off as, during the last 12 years, Surindra has built up a network that remains formidable and his status as a minister of state of the lucrative excise department gives him the much-needed edge in the ongoing turf war with fellow Yadavs for control of the vital levers of power and authority in Gaya.

If Surindra has to salvage his position, he will have to see to it that none of his detractors succeeds in grabbing the post of Gaya mayor and for this he may have to forge new caste equations at the local level. But this is easier said than done.

Successful nominees:: Following candidates have been elected from ward nos. given against their name for the corporation:

Kanhai Manjhi(01), countermanded(02), Lacho Devi(03), Binod Kumar Mandal (04), Anil Kumar(05), Shazli(06), Mukesh Ranjan(07), Jitendra Paswan(08), Asha Devi(09), Anil Sharma(10), Ajay Sharma(11), Suresh Sharma(12), Jasim Khan(13), Tabassum Khanam(14), Chanchala Devi(15), Nazrat Jehan(16), countermanded(17), Renuka Palit(18), Chanchala Devi(19), Zainab Khatoon(20), Moinuddin(21), Ibrar Ahmed alias Bhola-uncontested(22), Asad Perwez (23), Sanjay Kumar(24), Subodh Kumar(25), Asha Devi(26), Bibi Wakeelan(27), Renu Chaurasia(28), Anita Sinha(29), Shanti Devi(30), Salauddin(31), Om Prakash Singh(32), Jitendra Yadav alias Bachhu Yadav-uncontested(33), countermanded(34), Vikramaditya Kushwaha (35), Indra Dev Vidrohi(36), Sujit Kumar Mahto(37), Munni Devi(38), Sanjay Singh(39), Vishwanath Singh(40).

4,Shiv Sena criticises divestment policy,"MUMBAI: The Shiv Sena has yet again voiced its strong objection to the Centreâ€™s retrenchment and disinvestment policy. The party has called for a gradual transition to the new economy and a set of safety nets in the larger interest of the working class and farmers. In his maiden speech in the Rajya Sabha, Sena MP Eknath Thakur said the rampant unemployment and the trauma of economic reforms had unleashed a litany of problems which, he said, threatened to create fissures in the countryâ€™s social structure. In Mumbai, beer bars have been mushrooming.To make ends meet, many young girls in search of livelihood have joined these bars as dancers, while young boys are hitching onto the mafia bandwagon of Dawood Ibrahim or similar other brands, Thakur said, and urged the Centre to create more job opportunities for the jobless. â€œThe Sena was all for the economic glasnost, but was opposed to the sequencing and the nature of the reforms,â€� Thakur said. The farmers and the labourers are the ones who bear the brunt of reforms. They must, therefore, be given time to accept them gradually. Even if we have a constant GDP growth rate of six or eight per cent, the nation will experience the trauma of the paradigm shift to a new economy, he said and cautioned the NDA allies that his party felt compelled to strike a â€œrather divergent noteâ€� on the issue. While disinvesting, the Centre should think of handing over sick units to the workers, he suggested. The Union labour ministry should place some trust in the workers. They will show good results if unproductive units are handed over to them, he said. A well-known banker and financial expert, Thakur, is expected to fine-tune the Senaâ€™s strategy on the new economic policy and labour reforms. Sena chief Bal Thackeray has been stridently opposing disinvestment and retrenchment policy of Union finance minister Yashwant Sinha. Explaining that it was pointless to draw parallels between India and the US, Thakur said the latter had evolved a robust mechanism to maintain its employment level. â€œComparisons are improper and odious because of the differing levels of prosperity. In the US, the employment levels are monitored on a dayto-day basis and it is a key performance area (KPA) for the US president and US federal reserve chairman Allan Greenspan to preserve the employment levels. However, it appears that it is nobodyâ€™s KPA, nobodyâ€™s priority to do so in India. Unemployment is rising and when we are discussing labour reforms,this stark reality cannot be ignored.

5,CAG report raps state govt,"MUMBAI: The Comptroller and Auditor-General of India has rapped the state government for failing to recover royalty and penalty aggregating to Rs 202.68 crore from the Krishna Valley Development Corporation (KVDC) for illegal extraction of minerals. The CAG report, tabled in the just-concluded budget session of the state legislature, points out that the KVDC extracted minerals like murum stone and crush-stone clay and utilised them for the construction of Neera Deodhar and Gunjanwadi dams during 1997-98 without paying a royalty of Rs 11.50 crore. The report states that the corporation had neither applied for, nor permitted, to extract minerals.

7,'Conspiracy in Godhra killings not ruled out',"PATNA: Railway minister Nitish Kumar has denied that there was any report of the Railway Protection Force (RPF) which has ruled out any conspiracy theory behind the burning of bogies of Sabarmati Express in Godhra.

The incident triggered off the two-month long communal violence in Gujarat. â€œI have not received a report from the RPF which rules out conspiracy behind the Godhra incident. It is not the job of the RPF to look into the conspiracy angle of the incident. It is for the police to look into the affair,â€� he said on Sunday. He was reacting to an exclusive report aired by an electronic channel.

In response to an article appearing in a newspaper questioning the role of RPF personnel in the Godhra incident, he said he had asked the DGP to submit a report to him on the role of the RPF during the burning of bogies.

â€œThe report does mention the sequence of events leading to the burning of the bogies and the role of RPF men during that period,â€� he added.

Kumar said that he was satisfied with the role of RPF men during the incident.

â€œThere were just four RPF men at that time, and they opened fire and also managed to get the mob retreat from the train. If they had not acted then consequences could have been more serious,â€� he added.

8,Onion farmers threaten stir,"PUNE:The state unit of Bharatiya Kisan Mahasangh (BKM) has threatened to gherao Union commerce minister Murasoli Maran in New Delhi on May 7 to highlight the plight of onion cultivators and demand that the government lift all restrictions on onion exports. A statement released by Mauli Tupe, state unit vice-president of BKM said that although the Union government decided to allow exports of seven lakh tonnes of onion during the season, only one lakh tonnes have been exported over the last couple of months. This has led to a slump in the local market prices, inflicting great losses upon onion farmers. The May 7 is the last resort, to draw the attention of the Centre to the crisis,Tupe states. According to the release, the country is likely to be saddled with 20 lakh tonnes of surplus onions, following a bumper harvest in the current season. it is therefore to remove all restrictions on onion exports and abolish the quota system for export,Tupe adds. The union leader also alleges that the government has never seriously considered a five-year plan for tackling the onion issue.The government has only made cosmetic changes in the policy, which does not solve the problems faced by onion cultivators. The BKM has suggested that Union government undertake a study of foreign markets to help tap the true potential of onion exports.

9,Resentment among BJP ex-ministers,"LUCKNOW: Resentment is brewing among senior BJP leaders who could not find a berth in the 24-member Mayawati ministry which was sworn in on May 3.

A few senior BJP leaders, who were ministers in the Kalyan Singh and Rajnath Singh cabinets, are upset over their being dropped from the cabinet to accommodate others. Although they have been assured berths in the cabinet expansion after the confidence vote, a few of them still fear missing the bus. Harish Chandra Srivastava â€˜Harishjiâ€™, Premlata Katiyar, Dr Narendra Kumar Singh Gaur, Dr Nepal Singh, Fagu Chauhan and a few others are annoyed for their non inclusion in the cabinet. But Srivastava has high hopes of getting included in the first cabinet expansion.

â€œIt was insulting and humiliating,â€� fumed an ex-minister saying that they have registered their protest with party state president Kalraj Mishra.

The most significant omission from the Mayawati cabinet from the BJP quota was that of former finance minister Harish Chandra Srivastava. A senior BJP leader, Srivatavaâ€™s name figured in the BJP list, but he was replaced with a nominee, much junior to him, to placate BJP Legislature Party leader Rajnath Singh.

What pained these former ministers most was that while Ram Prakash Triptahi was given a place, they were left out. â€œIt seems that those who threw their weight around and had some nuisance value were given place,â€� rued another ex-minister.

Significantly, Srivastava was a part of the BJP core team which was holding talks with the BSP leadership to work out the BJP-BSP alliance for formation of the government in the state.

Another case of missing names is that of Premlata Katiyar. A heavyweight in the Kalyan ministry, the former social welfare and SC/ST and backward welfare minister had made several rounds to Delhi to get her name included in the list of cabinet ministers to be sworn in on May 3 alongwith Mayawati. But that was not to be.

Former secondary education and language minister Dr Nepal Singh also met with the same fate. He was expecting to be included in the cabinet in the first go, but had to return with a long face after the swearing-in ceremony.

Dr Narendra Kumar Singh Gaur, the former sugarcane and medical education minister, was another leader in the list of â€˜missing namesâ€™. Similarly, smaller BJP allies are also upset over they being ignored at cost of â€˜big brotherâ€™ Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD).

None of the three alliesâ€” UP Loktantrik Congress Party, Janata Dal-U and Lok Janasakti Partyâ€” were given any representation. â€œIt has given a wrong message. Ajit Singh joined the BJP alliance much later but he bargained and managed to get two of his party members, including a first-timer, to the cabinet rank. We feel cheated,â€� complained a BJP ally leader.

These disgruntled former ministers and senior leaders have registered their protest with Kalraj Mishra who has assured them of a berth during the expansion. â€œA few steps had to be taken keeping in mind caste equations.

They will be corrected in the first expansion itself,â€� assured a senior BJP leader.

Nearly 350 copies of Millat magazine printed in Hindi and another 250 copies of a magazine Witness were seized from him along with a mobile phone, inflammatory speeches in Urdu and religious literature. â€œSome of the contents of the literature seized were so inciting that it could have led to a major law and order problem had the material been circulated,â€� said a senior GRP official who interrogated Badra.

Police also recovered a letter written by Falahi and addressed to Noman. A diary containing telephone numbers, names and addresses of other SIMI activists and sympathisers was also seized from his possession. â€œWe are hopeful of identifying more associates and active members of SIMI on the basis of information provided by Noman in the near future,â€� DIG Railways AKD Dwivedi said.

12,Three arrested for Naubatpur killings,"PATNA: Three hardcore members of the Peopleâ€™s War were arrested on the charges of killing retired sub-inspector Sahjananad and his nephew Dhananjay in Bhushanchak village under Naubatpur police station on Friday night.

But the police could ascertain the identity of only one of the arrested PW members. He has been identified as Jogendra Verma. Police claimed the three arrested persons, during their interrogation, have said they are Peopleâ€™s War members who were involved in killing Sahjanand and his nephew.

Senior police officials including ADG (Patna zone) A R Sinha, IG (operation) Neelmani, SP (rural) Amit Kumar and SP (STF) B K Singh, went to Naubatpur to supervise the line of action to be taken up by the Naubatpur police in arresting the extremists. Officers-in-charge of the neighbouring police stations, including that of Paliganj, Bikram and Masaurhi were also briefed by the senior officials. Additional police force has been sent to Naubatpur where a police picket has also been established fearing retaliatory move by the extremists and also, by the Ranvir Sena.

Abduction case: The police have not yet been able to make any breakthrough in the case related to the kidnapping of Raju kumar, son of Shankar Prasad Jauhari, a dealer of gems in Bakerganj.According to the FIR, Raju Kumar was called by one of his neighbours, Arif, on May 2 from his residence on the pretext of ascertaining the veracity of some antiques. Raju was taken on an Ambassador car. The family members became aware of Rajuâ€™s kidnapping when ransom money was demanded by the criminals. The police said that Arifâ€™s reported connection with a minister of state could not be ascertained.

13,LJP to go it alone in polls: Paswan,"PATNA: Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) leader and former Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan asserted here that his party will contest all assembly and parliamentary elections on its own in future.

â€œThere will be no alliance with the Congress or Peopleâ€™s Front or any other party,â€� he remarked while speaking to mediapersons on Sunday. He claimed that his party will emerge as the â€œthird forceâ€� in Bihar on its own strength.

Paswan came to his home state for the first time on Sunday after resigning from the Union ministry. He was given a rousing reception by his supporters at the Patna airport with slogans like â€œDharti gunje asmaan, Ram Vilas Paswanâ€� renting the air. However, the partyâ€™s day-long dharna in protest against the communal violence in Gujarat proved to be a brief affair with Paswan sitting beside the statue of JP near the I-T building for just about 15 minutes.

Paswan refused to be drawn into the charges and remarks made against him by Union minister Nitish Kumar and RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav.

â€œI have not resigned to abuse anyone. I quit in view of larger issues,â€� he stressed.

â€œI do not care who gains by my quitting the NDA. Even if my decision means that I will go into political oblivion, I am prepared for this. Being a minister or MP is not everything,â€� said Paswan.

Paswan, in response to a question if his party is going to contest in the Danapur assembly by-polls, made it clear that he will not take any step which may benefit Laloo. The Danapur assembly constituency, previously represented by Laloo, goes to polls on May 31.

Paswan questioned the wisdom of political pundits predicting a benefit for Laloo after he left the NDA. â€œIf Muslims vote for me, will it benefit Laloo?â€� he asked.

14,Major setback for Cong in council polls,"PATNA: The Congress on Sunday suffered a major setback in the Bihar legislative council biennial elections when two of its sitting members failed to retain their seats. The party, which had fielded candidates in five of the eight council constituencies — four each of teachers and graduates — going to polls (leaving three others for the ruling RJD), lost four of them. The Congress had contested the Darbhanga graduates, Darbhanga teachers, Tirhut graduates, Tirhut teachers and Saran teachers seats while the RJD was in the poll fray for the Patna graduates, Patna teachers and Kosi graduates seats. The only saving grace for the Congress was the victory of its sitting member Nilambar Chaudhary in the Darbhanga graduates constituency. Chaudhary defeated his nearest Samata Party rival Rana Gangeshwar Singh by a margin of 7,403 votes. BPCC vice-president Padmasha Jha was defeated in the Tirhut teachers constituency. BJP nominee Narendra Prasad Singh won the seat. BJP's Birkeshwar Prasad Singh was leading over his nearest rival Awadhesh Kumar Mandal at the end of seventh round of counting in the Kosi graduates constituency. Sitting Congress member Chandrama Singh failed to retain his Saran teachers seat. He lost to CPI nominee Kedar Pandey by 1,006 votes. But veteran CPI leader and former MP Shatrughna Prasad Singh lost to sitting CPM member Basudev Singh in the Darbhanga teachers constituency by a slender margin of 127 votes. Nawal Kishore Rai of the RJD retained his Patna teachers seat defeating his nearest rival Shriram Padmadev by a margin of 3,868 votes. Sitting Congress member Ram Kumar Singh has reportedly lost to Devesh Chandra Thakur (Independent) in the Tirhut graduates constituency by about 300 votes. The ruling RJD had fielded sitting member and former minister Diwakar Prasad Singh from the Kosi graduates constituency and a new face, Azad Gandhi, from the Patna graduates constituency. Gandhi was leading over his Samata Party rival Neeraj Kumar while Diwakar Prasad Singh was trailing.

15,Cong seeks Singhal’s arrest,"NEW DELHI: The Congress Party has demanded the arrest of Vishwa Hindu Parishad working president Ashok Singhal under sections 153 and 153 A of the Indian Penal Code for making an inflammatory speech on the Gujarat carnage at Lucknow. This issue was raised in the Rajya Sabha also when home minister L K Advani was replying to the motion on Gujarat Monday.

While briefing the press, Congress spokesman Jaipal Reddy said, â€˜â€˜Singhal justified the carnage and projected it as a manifestation of the wakening of Hindu society. These statements are shocking even by Singhalâ€™s standards.â€™â€™ Reddy pointed out that the Prevention of Terrorism Act was so devised as to exclude those provisions that would have made people like Singhal guilty under Pota.

According to Reddy, the VHP chief does not represent the glorious traditions of Hindu society, but the antithesis of it.

Earlier in the Rajya Sabha, Congress member Suresh Pachauri and Nilotpal Basu of the CPM asked Advani what action would be taken against Singhal. Though Advani first said he would find out the veracity of the statement from Singhal, he later assured the House that action would be taken if any objectionable comment had been made.

16,Bhandari wants survey of riot-hit areas completed,"GANDHINAGAR: Gujarat Governor S S Bhandari told top officials here that the work of surveying the damage suffered by the riot victims ought to be completed â€˜â€˜most urgentlyâ€™â€™.

A source said the governor had told the officials at a meeting that the survey should serve in providing a liberal package to the victims, enabling their early return to their housesâ€™â€™.

The governor, who heads the all-party committee on relief camps, said there should be no target-based approach to close down the relief camps. He emphasised the need to assess the â€˜â€˜position of the inmates and their willingness to go back and resettle at their old places of livingâ€™â€™. He added that all necessary facilities, particularly security arrangements, be provided to those who wished to return.

He also told the district collectors of Ahmedabad, Vadodara, Sabarkantha, Panchmahals and Mehsana to â€˜â€˜individually attend to the problemâ€™â€™.

Based on complaints, the governorâ€™s personal intervention in Sabarkantha ensured a large-scale re-survey in the entire district and re-disbursement of cheques. Those who had received a mere Rs 200 against house damages later got between Rs 12,000 and Rs 32,000.

Officials pointed out that of the 8,000 families who had filled up claim forms in Ahmedabad, 6,638 cases had been surveyed. However, the officials admitted that so far the survey of the worst-affected areas of Ahmedabad â€” Naroda-Patia and Saijpur-Patia â€” had not begun. The reason given was these were â€˜â€˜more complicatedâ€™â€™. Similarly, in other affected areas, Isanpur, Ghodasar, Chamanpura (Gulmarg Society), Odhav, Kochrab, Naroda, the survey began only two days ago. Setback to surveys in Ahmedabad took place after two teams were attacked in Behrampura. Now, the survey work had resumed as the teams were provided with security.

As on Monday, there was close to 60,000 people living in 49 relief camps in Ahmedabad. But around 25,000 had left the camps over the past 45 days due to the â€˜â€˜situation of uncertaintyâ€™â€™ in the city. The camps were not being shut down for the same reason. Yet, livelihood issues were being tackled â€˜â€˜wherever necessaryâ€™â€™ with the help of the district industrial centre.

17,Police 'income' dries up at 11th hour,"HYDERABAD: Police commissioner M V Krishna Rao''s orders that all bars and liquor shops shut down by 11 pm have not only hit the liquor business, they have also affected the city police itself. With the evenings in the city beginning to turn dry by 11 pm, the monthly mamools from bars and liquor shops â€” the two main sources of income'' for the city police â€” have turned into a trickle.

Last week, the commissioner issued orders asking bars, restaurants and wine shop owners to close their establishments by 11 pm and threatened punitive action if they failed to comply with the rules.

The commissioner is also said to have made the station house officers (SHOs) responsible for implementing the new orders.

Krishna Rao also reportedly issued oral instructions that if any bar was found open beyond 11 pm in any station limits, he would not hesitate to transfer the SHO to a ''loopline'' posting.

With the commissioner turning sterner by the day, the police has had no option but to meet the 11 pm deadline.

The SHOs are now vying to implement the new orders.

In the last few days, the police booked several cases against violators of the commissioner''s orders.

However, this has had a fallout on the police itself.Wine and bar owners, who otherwise pay fixed mamools to the police stations every month, have started refusing payments.

A wine shop owner generally pays between Rs 2,000 to Rs 5,000 a month to the police station under whose jurisdiction his shop falls, while bar owners are ''required'' to pay anything between Rs 5,000 to Rs 20,000 a month.

The ''collectors'' (constables posted for the specific job of collecting mamools in the first week of every month), were in for a rude shock this week when a number of liquor shop owners refused to pay the mamools.â€œEach bar and restaurant in our area used to pay about Rs 10,000 month as mamools.

Now, they are not even paying half that amount because we are forced to close the bars before the 11 pm deadline,'''' a north zone inspector told The Times Of India.

Meanwhile, excise commissioner Bhanwarlal also reportedly ordered excise department officials to prevent the sale of hooch in the city, which was another important source of revenue for the city police.

18,Manmohan questions clean chit to Gujarat govt,"NEW DELHI: Opposition Leader in RS Manmohan Singh on Monday questioned a statement reportedly made by the PM that ""everything is reasonably well"" in Gujarat.

""Some confusion is being created by newspaper reports quoting the Prime Minister that there is no need for a directive to Gujarat government which is doing reasonably well,"" Singh said.

""The conduct of the Centre and the Gujarat Government in dealing with the situation in the state does not inspire the confidence of this House,"" the Congress leader said while speaking on the Opposition sponsored motion.

He said the state government ""abjectly"" failed to discharge its constitutional obligations and the Central government also could not realise the gravity of the situation.

Referring to the package of Rs 150 crore announced by Vajpayee, Singh said the damage was much more and there should be an effective plan of action.

""The behaviour of the Gujarat Government does not give any confidence that it will do justice"", he said.

19,I will serve the party as a foot soldier: Jyotiraditya,"NEW DELHI: The state government has failed in Gujarat and the Union government is quibbling over technicalities as far as the difference between Article 355 and Article 356 is concerned, says young Congress MP Jyotiraditya Scindia.

Speaking to Times News Network Scindia said, ""There is no doubt that the law and order machinery has failed and the state government is responsible.""

The elements, who incited people, would be dealt with sternly"", he told reporters after inaugurating a water supply scheme in tribal-dominated Vyara and Kamrej talukas.

Modi said there was a ""planned conspiracy"" to tarnish the image of the state after the February 27 Godhra carnage and in the interest of the economy of the country, it was the need of the hour that people from all religions join hands to create communal harmony and bring back total normalcy.

He said political parties led by Congress tried to engineer a split among NDA allies on the censure motion in Parliament on Gujarat, but their vote bank politics ""was exposed"".

He said former Punjab DGP K P S Gill was not appointed as security advsior under pressure from the Centre.

""His service was meant to strengthen and bring professionalism in the police force as Gujarat also happens to be a border state"", Modi added.

21,Rebel BJP MLA claims he can dislodge UP govt,"BAHRAICH: A rebel BJP MLA, who has threatened to vote against the confidence motion on the Mayawati government, on Monday claimed that he had the support of enough number of MLAs to dislodge the BSP-BJP coalition government in Uttar Pradesh.

Talking to reporters here, Raja Chandra Mani Kant Singh said some MLAs of other parties in the coalition were also in touch with him. The state assembly would witness a decisive battle during the vote of confidence on May 17, he said.

Singh said he had told the state BJP leadership that he was not acting in self-interest but the interest of the people of the region who are unhappy that their representatives had been denied ministerial berth while junior MLAs have been allocated ministries.

He said thousands of his supporters would leave for Lucknow on Tuesday where they would submit their resignations to the party leaders.

Meanwhile, BJP legislature party leader Rajnath Singh exuded confidence that those dissatisfied over non-inclusion in the Mayawati-led BSP-BJP coalition ministry would be pacified and the government would prove its majority on the floor of the house comfortably.

Singh said that he was aware that some people had expressed their resentment over being denied ministerial berths and added that the party leadership was in contact with them.

BJP state president Kalraj Misra, when contacted on phone, said none of the leaders who were reportedly unhappy over being left out of the ministry had got in touch with him so far.

22,Trinamul may join govt after peace returns to Gujarat,"KOLKATA: Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee on Monday said her party would consider going back to the NDA ministry once peace was restored in riot-torn Gujarat.

""The Prime Minister has always wanted us to rejoin. But we are not selfish. We want the Gujarat communal clashes to stop. Then we will consider,"" Banerjee told newspersons here when asked whether her party had taken a decision to rejoin the Union Ministry.

Banerjee said the party was yet to discuss the issue with the NDA leaders including the Prime Minister.

The TC chief, who lost her temper when journalists broached the topic, said she was tired of answering the same question every day.

Out of the four years that the NDA was in office, her party had lent support for two and half years from outside.

Regretting that her party''s bold stand of quitting the ministry on the issue of corruption had not received the appreciation it deserved, she said journalists ''friendly with the CPI-M'' had been quizzing her daily on the issue of rejoining the Centre.

25,Patriot games: It’s Lara versus Tara,"MUMBAI: Lara Croft looks into a mirror and finds, to her awe and delight, that she has grown a third eye.Also, there is an exotic Vedic amulet on her arm and a bindi on the forehead, and she looks more like Aishwarya Rai than Angelina Jolie. She even bears an Indian parody of her nameâ€”she is now Tara Shroff.

Lara Croft, the graphical protagonist of CDROM game Tomb Raider who has been immortalised in a movie of the same title, has been been given an Indian avatar by ad whiz Alyque Padamsee and software company Purple Image. As creative advisor to the techie company, Mr Padamsee has pulled a smart takeoff on Hollywoodâ€™s digital darling, creating Tara to promote Purple Imageâ€™s products. She can also be leased for games, commercials, serials and films.

Tomb Raider is an action game in which the player gets into Laraâ€™s skin, kills enemies coldbloodedly and seeks out the secret tomb. The game sold millions of copies, with Lara cleverly packaged as the ultimate new-age male fantasy â€”exaggeratedly sensuous and daring.

Padamsee and Company hope to leverage this for the desi market.

â€œTara has more sex appeal than Lara,â€™â€™ says Purple Image CEO Ajay Arora. â€œShe can do everything Lara can do and more.â€™â€™ According to Mr Padamsee, Tara is a product of technoimagination. â€œSalim and his team at Purple Image worked for three months on the technology and I used imagination,â€™â€™ he said.

The team decided that Tara should have certain Indian characteristics. She derives superpower through yoga. She has the third eye of Shiva, which she uses as a weapon. She can levitate like a yogi. She is a cross between Aiswarya Rai in beauty and Madhu Sapre in muscle tone.

â€œWe must have changed her look at least dozen times. Every time we felt her nose was too long, smile too wide, eyes too big..that sort of thing,â€™â€™ chuckles Mr Padamsee. â€œEventually, we have somebody who is very dear to our hearts.â€™â€™ He adds,â€œI even had a dream about her recently.â€™â€™

Currently, a proposal to create an Englishlanguage serial is being worked out with Canadian company; the show will be beamed in India and abroad.Web episodes for an internet serial are also being planned.

Tara Shroff will be unveiled on May 12 in Juhu. Mr Padamsee, creator of ad and TV icons like Lalitaji, Karamchand, the Lyril girl and Cherry Charlie, will hand-hold his new-born baby till that point.
