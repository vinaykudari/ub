0,"Tide turns for govt IPOs, bankers say it's perfect timing","NEW DELHI: The disinvestment of government stakes in PSUs witnessed a remarkable recovery on Thursday. CMC has been oversubscribed at Rs 500 per share while the floor price is Rs 475 per share. IBP â€” where there was hardly any offtake till Wednesday â€” got bids for 71% of the offer. And for IPCL too, oversubscription of 2.55 times was achieved.

Disinvestment minister Arun Shourie can take the credit for this as many fund managers feel that this is a reaction to his strongly-worded warning to the merchant bankers involved in selling the shares on Wednesday.

However, bankers are now saying the reason for the poor response so far was their inability to launch roadshows in the international market due to lack of time. As the decision to disinvest was taken very late, the merchant bankers completed the homework for the roadshow at the last moment.

A leading banker said that large investors did not take a view on making investments unless they were personally explained about the companies. Most of the roadshows were launched in US and European market on Monday and Tuesday only. As the US is 12 to 18 hours behind Indian time, any roadshow in the US has a delayed impact here.

Merchant bankers say IBP received 74% issue subscription before the opening of the US market on Thursday. Once the US market opens on Thursday, they feel IBP would receive more than 100% subscription.

CMC is the clear leader in the IPO pack. The issue started very poorly, but by Thursday it was oversubscribed by over 4 times.

Interestingly, substantial subscription came at Rs 500 per share, where it is oversubscribed.

In the first day of its opening, Dredging Corp received bids for 1.8 million shares, which is 32 per cent of the total shares on offer of 5.6 million. But, interestingly, all the bids came at the higher end of the price-band of Rs 385-400 per share.

But many merchant bankers remained doubtful of the success of ONGC and Gail issues. They felt that the mega issues like ONGC (142.59 million shares on offer) and Gail (84.5 million shares) could be sold only on overwhelming demand, which was clearly lacking this time.

DSP Merrill Lynch, which is involved in selling ONGCâ€™s mega issue, exuded confidence saying the issue would be sold on the back of good demand from overseas investors.

A banker looking after Gail said there was good response for the IPO.

Bankers feel the ONGC issue will depend on Gailâ€™s fortunes. The Gail issue closes on March 5, the day the ONGC issue opens.

2,Nandlal slams govt for victimisation,"MUMBAI: Upright bureaucrats have seldom got to hold key positions under the Democratic Front regime.

First, it was housing authority vice-president U.P.S. Madan, who was unceremoniously shunted out this week for scuttling a powerful builderâ€™s plan to grab prime plots with the help of some Congress politicians.

Now, TNN has learnt that one of the stateâ€™s seniormost IAS officers, Nandlal, had threatened to quit the services and take voluntary retirement a few months ago on the ground that he could no longer work under such an administrative environment.

â€œMy spirit is not in tune with the working environment. After deep introspection, I find myself in a situation in which I am unable to adjust myself properly...,â€™â€™ Mr Nandlal wrote in a letter to chief secretary Ajit Nimbalkar about four months ago.

Although Mr Nandlal refused to comment, Mantralaya sources said that Mr Nimbalkar later talked him out of it and reminded him of his imminent promotion as additional chief secretary on February 1, 2004.

Considered to be a no-nonsense officer with vast administrative experience, Mr Nandlal was strongly tipped to take charge of the sensitive post of the state home secretary. He was also a strong contender for the Mumbai municipal commissionerâ€™s post.

However, the government shunted him to a side posting in the planning department and, instead, chose to appoint a relatively junior bureaucrat, Johny Joseph, as the cityâ€™s new civic chief. The home secretaryâ€™s post was also given to a low-profile bureaucrat, Suresh Kumar,who retires in 11 months.

Mr Nandlal has now dashed off another letter to the chief secretary, stating that only an IAS officer of the rank of chief secretary can be appointed as municipal commissioner. Mr Joseph is only a principal secretary, and hence his appointment is not keeping in consonance with a supreme court directive.

Mr Nandlal has already spend two-and-a-half years in the general administration department, which is considered to be an insignificant posting.

The 1969 batch IAS officer has been sidelined by the government ever since he unearthed major scams in his earlier postings in the revenue and forest departments.

3,Maratha strongman played long political innings,"MUMBAI: A prominent leader of the Maratha community, S.B. Chavan was known to keep away from controversies. He believed in the politics of consensus and championed the cause of those living in the backward regions of the state. He was especially known for his contribution to improving Maharashtra's irrigation system. Mr Chavan plunged into active politics by joining the Quit India movement in the erstwhile state of Hyderabad which was then under the Nizam. He was also one of the leaders of the Hyderabad liberation movement. For most of his political career, he professed his loyalty to the Nehru-Gandhi family. As chief minister in 1975-'77, he handled the Emergency declared by the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. However, soon after it was lifted, he deserted her and formed the Maharashtra Samajwadi Party and served as a minister in Sharad Pawar's Progressive Democratic Front government in 1979. But within a short span of time he returned to the Congress fold and was elected to the Lok Sabha from Nanded in 1980. In 1986, he had a second innings as chief minister when he took over the reins of the state from Vasantdada Patil. He was replaced by Sharad Pawar in 1988 and inducted in the Union cabinet. During the Narasimha Rao government in 1990-'95, he looked after the home ministry. It was during his tenure as the Union home minister that the infamous demolition of the Babri masjid took place in Ayodhya which was followed by communal riots all over the country, including Mumbai. As home minister, he also handled negotiations with the Bodo rebels and other insurgent groups in the northeastern states. Mr Chavan also served as foreign minister and defence minister. Mr Chavan's last political assignment was to head the coordination committee appointed to ensure the smooth functioning of the Congress-led Democratic Front government in the state.

4,"From Durga to Diana, goddesses rule dance bars","MUMBAI: Thou shalt not take the name of the lord in vain, said the state government on Wednesday to the cityâ€™s 1,000-odd dance bars. But a quick scan of bars across the city reveals that their names, like Mumbai itself, are a delicious smorgasbord of the divine and the downright funny.

For startersâ€”and not surprisinglyâ€”itâ€™s not gods but goddesses who rule on the dance bar boards. Thereâ€™s Durga Parameshwari in Sion and Laxmi Palace in Chembur, but thereâ€™s a host of alter egos like Ambika in Navi Mumbai and Uma Palace in Mulund, aka Parvati aka Durga. If you want to get classical, not just Vedic, thereâ€™s Diana (inVashi), who is not only a late English princess but the Greek goddess of hunting.( We are still looking for Mohiniâ€” the divine seductress).

Perhaps state excise minister Anil Deshmukh should consider extending the ban from the pantheon of million-odd Hindu gods to the vaguely religious. He could start with Puja in Vashi, Sai Lila in Ghatkopar and Sant Punjab in Chembur. (Question: can a state be a saint?). And why leave out sacred rivers, like the Godavari bar inMira Road?

Manjit Singh, a bar-ownersâ€™ representative, is okay with the move to remove the gods from the boards.Not because of the dancing girls but the alcohol. â€œEven in Amritsar, they donâ€™t allow liquor bars near the Golden Temple,â€™â€™ he says.

If divinely-named bars had to come down to earth, they could take a tip or two from their â€˜secularâ€™ counterparts. There are the frankâ€”Tipsy and Cheers in Dadarâ€”and the prosaic, like Late Night in Borivli.

Then there are the false promisesâ€”Baywatch and Night Queen at Dadar, Golden Door at Parel and Valentine at Mulund. Incidentally, golden seems to be a popular, perhaps hopeful choice, given the amount of money some stamp kings spend in these places.

Thereâ€™s even a Golden Bin at Parle. Finally, there are the amusing onesâ€”a bar on the road to Panvel is called Speed Breakerâ€”and the uncannily precient. A Grant Road bar is called White House.

5,VHP to take out rally on March 23,"PATNA: Vishwa Hindu Parishad will organise a demonstration against anti-Hindu activities in the state on March 23 and give a memorandum to the government protesting against the move for â€œIslamisation of Biharâ€�.

The VHPâ€™s regional organisation secretary, Bihar and Jharkhand, Ras Behari, said here on Wednesday that the VHP, in its memorandum to the governor, will urge him to take necessary steps to check the anti-Hindu steps taken by the state government and its anti-constitutional and antinational stance.

Leading Hindu saints of Bihar and Jharkhand will participate in the rally, along with other people,which will start from Gandhi Maidan and end at Raj Bhavan on March 23, he said.

He said that the recent conversion of 5,000 Hindus to Christianity is alarming and even Union home minister has directed an inquiry into it.

He criticised the state government for its decision to appoint 40 per cent Muslims as primary school teachers in the name of appointing Urdu teachers and to appoint Urdu-knowing sub-inspectors in every police station.

Ras Behari and state VHP working president Nitya Gopal Chakravarti told mediamen that the VHP will press for Presidentâ€™s rule in Bihar.

They said that the incidents of desecration of Hindu temples had increased in the state.

Infiltration from Bangladesh into the eastern districts of Bihar has changed the demography there. This, together with religious conversions in Bihar, has resulted in an alarming situation which may be termed as a trend towards â€œIslamisation of Biharâ€�, they added.

The VHP leaders criticised the state government for not allowing the entry of Praveen Togadia.

6,Ex-DGP of Bihar may contest polls,"NEW DELHI: Bihar''s former police chief D P Ojha, who had taken on RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav, may contest the general election as a JD(U) candidate from Begusarai in Bihar.

The seat is supposed to be a ""bhumihar citadel"" and Ojha has of late become the state''s bhumihar icon.

Meanwhile, the Opposition has announced its candidate against foreign minister Yashwant Sinha.

The Hazaribagh seat in Jharkhand from where Sinha was last elected has been allotted to the CPI. The CPI''s candidate for Hazaribagh, Bhubaneswar Prasad Mahta, had in 1998 polls come second to Sinha.

This is also an indicator that the seat-sharing wrangles in Jharkhand have been sorted out between the Congress and JMM, with the RJD and CPI getting one each and JMM probably five and the Congress keeping the rest.

But in Bihar, Laloo still has not committed himself to his allies. Apparently, Ojha''s choice of an NDA constituent instead of the BJP would have something to do with the constituency that he has zeroed in.

Bhumihars of Begusarai have been traditionally aligned with the CPI and in fact, one of the first public functions Ojha attended after being removed was that of the commemoration of the CPI''s legendary leader Chandrashekhar Singh in Begsurai in January.

8,Move to hush up firing incident,"MUZAFFARPUR: An all-out effort is going on to hush up the Paraiya firing incident as an RJD leader and his supporter, a mukhiya, are believed to be responsible for the incident, killing one and injuring two others.

An unknown policeman and a doctor of S K Medical College Hospital have helped the assailants to minimise the case in their own way.

While a bullet pierced through the left chest of Bhutta Manjhi, a doctor attending him, has written on his prescription: ""Injury caused by assault."" No reference has been made on the hospital ticket about gunshot injury.

Moreover, Manjhi who is still in a subconscious state in the emergency ward of SKMCH since Sunday, complained to her attending wife and a friend on Tuesday through a gesture of hands that somebody, looking like a policemen, took his thumb impression on a blank paper. This has raised doubt that the police may distort his statement in favour of the real accused persons.

All this was alleged by the wife of the seriously injured villager of Paraiya and his friend while talking to this correspondent in the emergency ward of SKMCH on Wednesday forenoon.

Jagdish Sahni, with gunshot injury on his nose, told this correspondent in ward no. 6 of the hospital that he was fired upon by a person from the vehicle occupied by the ""leader"".

The hospital doctor has not mentioned that the injury he received was due to gunshot.

The role of Kurhani police is also doubtful. The mukhiya, who, according to FIR, opened fire, is alleged to have shot dead a ration shop dealer Naresh singh on January 19. Later, A large number of villagers of the area had staged a demonstration before the DM here. But the mukhiya was not only allowed to roam freely but also to organise a meeting in honour of the RJD leader. Jail minister Basawan Bhagat, MLA from Kurhani, was also to attend the meeting but he returned when someone informed him in the way about the shooting incident, sources said.

Meanwhile, JD (U) leaders Harendra Kumar and Ganesh Bharati, who also visited the hospital on Wednesday to meet the injured persons, demanded adequate compensation to the family of the deceased and to the injured persons. They have demanded a probe by the commissioner or the DIG to unravel the truth.

9,Elite colleges inch towards autonomy,"KOLKATA: The cityâ€™s elite colleges seem to be moving towards autonomy. A crucial meeting between the Calcutta University authorities and the University Grants Commission at New Delhi on Thursday, has helped ease the stand off on the autonomy issue.

The UGC had given an ultimatum to CU asking it to give a final decision on granting autonomy to St Xavierâ€™s and Ashutosh College by February 26. The two colleges had applied to the UGC directly for autonomous status.

This Monday, the CU Syndicate had expressed doubts over certain autonomy clauses, especially those concerning the universityâ€™s representation in the committee that would shortlist colleges eligible for autonomy.

Other objections related to the lack of universityâ€™s control over academic matters of autonomous colleges and the composition of their governing bodies. It was decided that the Syndicate would bring up the issue of autonomy again if the UGC was willing to modify these clauses.

""We are happy that the UGC has accepted each clause and has assured us that they will make necessary changes in their autonomy charter for West Bengal.

They said that each region has its unique character and these will be accommodated,"" said Suranjan Das, pro vice chancellor (academic) of CU. Apart from him, state higher education secretary Jawhar Sircar and director of public instructions Piyush Ganguly, were present at the meeting.

""We have been asked to send in our demands in a written format and the UGC will also give us a written reply. After we get a reply from the UGC, we will raise the matter in the Syndicate again,"" Das added.

10,Buddha makes amends for IT order hit by bandh,"KOLKATA: Chief Minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on Thursday took it upon himself to undo the damage done by last Tuesdayâ€™s bandh.

A Rs 45-crore deal between a US bank â€“ ""its name is a top secret"" â€“ and Fitek â€“ a firm specialising in IT services for banks â€“ could not be clinched on Tuesday as a four-member team of the bank,which travelled from New Jersey, was stranded in Mumbai, unable to move to the city because of the bandh.

On Thursday, Bhattacharjee invited representatives of Fitek in his Assembly chamber and tried to allay their apprehensions. ""We wanted to impress upon them that February 24 was an exceptional day,"" he said. ""The reality in Bengal is more positive."" He promised Fitek and its US clients ""all the co-operation they need"".

He emphasised, however, that when he visited Italy three months ago there was a large demonstration against pay cuts. And France was immobilised by a transport strike. ""Such protests are not unique to Bengal,"" he said.

A Fitek spokesperson said the company would do its best to bring the bank back to Kolkata with its orders. It is important, he added, that the bank, which was planning to outsource some ""accounting jobs"", had decided not to leave India.

""We will tell our client that the bandh was an exception,"" he said, adding that Fitek has been operating in Kolkata for six years and had found the atmosphere ""congenial"".

Fitek even plans to move into the Bengal Intelligent Park. ""Our experience here is good. We have done some of our best jobs here, thanks to the excellent workers,"" the spokesperson said.

11,Sunni board lawyers may corner ASI,"LUCKNOW: Even before the arguments on the controversial Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) report on famous Ayodhya excavations could begin, the ASI seems falling into the ''trap'' laid by a battery of Central Sunni Waqf Board (CSWB) lawyers and independent archaeologists.

Already facing a ''perjury'' case, the ASI''s reply, submitted to the three-member special full Bench of the Allahabad High Court, may land it in deep trouble.

In the reply, the ASI has made a few ''damaging'' admissions which could be used against it by the SCWB counsels in proving that the ASI report was ""doctored, pre-conceived and was not based on material evidence found during excavations"" when arguments on the report begin from March 16.

The ASI, which had submitted its final report on August 22, 2003, is under fire from the Board and country''s top independent archaeologists for reaching to the conclusion that a temple-like structure, dating back to 10th-11th century, existed beneath the disputed site in Ayodhya.

Questioning the ASI claims that it had filed all relevant records, including hand-written or typed notes, at the time of filing the final report, the Board counsel had shot off a seven-point questionnaire seeking to know from the ASI team''s former leader Hari Manjhi ""if notes taken by team members were destroyed.""

The Board had also sought to know when the final report was drafted and who had drafted the final ''unnamed'' chapter (no X) in which the ASI had come to the conclusion of temple existence.

In its reply, filed on February 24, 2004, the ASI claimed that the different study groups were formed to draft chapters I to IX.

""The study group took notes at the time of study of objects and destroyed them after feeding the said information in the computer,"" stated Manjhi in his reply.

Significantly, Manjhi admitted that the final report was ''hurriedly'' drafted in just ''two'' days'' time between August 20 and 21, 2003, before it was submitted the next day on August 22, 2003.

""The rough notes and typed papers were destroyed by team members in the camp at Ayodhya as per the ''verbal'' instructions of the team leader in order to check and safeguard against any leakage of the highly sensitive nature of the report,"" the ASI admitted in its reply.

On the drafting of final summary chapter (no X), the ASI claimed that it was prepared ""collectively"" by team members who were writing the final report and was typed by ''computer typist''.

Although the ASI claimed it to be the ''normal'' practice to destroy notes, SCWB counsel Zafrayab Jilani insisted that ""those papers were important pieces of material record to prove that the report was not tampered with.""

How would ASI prove if we challenge that computer typist had made some grave errors while typing, questioned Jilani. Morever, pointed out Jilani, the ASI still did not disclose names of those persons who had drafted the final summary report.

The SCWB is all set to use ASI''s written admissions to blow its Ayodhya report to smithereens.

12,Cheers! Liquor shops to open till 11 pm,"LUCKNOW: Announcing its new excise policy, the Mulayam government on Thursday offered ''feel good'' sops for the tipplers too extending the closure time of all liquor shops for one more hour from 10 am to 11.00 pm while declaring no increase in prices of country-made liquor, IMFL and beer.

""The rationale behind this step was to check the illegal trade after closure of shops by 10.00 pm till now. The move would not only fetch more revenue but would also help undue interference of police as complained by customers and shop owners,"" claimed the principal secretary, excise Ravi Mathur.

Increasing the target from Rs 2850 crore to Rs 3000 crore for 2004-2005, the state government has announced to open 150 more model wine shops and ten per cent more new CML and IMFL shops all over the state to mop up heavy revenue losses it incurred during the current fiscal year.

The increase in the target would also be met by increasing bar licence fee for all categories by Rs 25,000.

Also, the government has decided to levy Rs 1500 as processing fee for new applicants from this year while fixing the licence fee for CML and CMFL shops at Rs 5 lakh.

The excise commissioner has been authorised by the government to sanction for opening of new shops as per demand with the rider of ten per cent restriction. The government has, however, lifted the restriction in the new policy that a person cannot open more more than two shops.

The toddy and bhang shops would be settled through auction as before. The shops of IMFL have been kept under nine categories as before but their licence fee has been raised by 15 per cent.

However, no increase has been made in excise duty on IMFL and its retail prices have been rationalised further.

13,Sena to stage demonstrations outside MEDA office,"PUNE: The Shiv Sena has warned that their workers will stage demonstrations in front of Maharashtra Energy Development Authority (MEDA) if it did not furnish the required information about windmills in Satara to India Meteorological Department within eight days.

Addressing a news conference here on Friday, Shiv Sena MLC Kanhaiyalal Gidwani said that IMD had asked for the contour maps of Satara and surrounding areas and the windward and leeward directions so that it could conduct a study to find out whether the windmills put up at Patan in Satara were responsible for the continuous drought in western Maharashtra.

It may be noted that Sena has alleged that the windmills were responsible for diverting monsoon clouds from western Maharashtra and that it has resulted in drought in western Maharashtra for three consecutive years. The IMD decided to conduct a study in the matter to verify whether the allegations had any substance.

Gidwani told reporters that the MEDA had given permission to in-stall approximately 900 windmills in Patan taluka of Satara district on one mountain which was approximately 1100 metres above sea level. ""The windmills are of 200 sq ft in height and we feel that they were driving the rain clouds away"", he said adding that as soon as the windmills started operating, western Maharashtra started experiencing drought.

Gidwani alleged that MEDA has not given the required information to IMD although it asked for it four months ago. ""Our party feels that all doubts about the windmills should be cleared well before the onset of next monsoon as combating drought was a costly affair"", he remarked.

He further alleged that MEDA was deliberately not giving the in-formation about the windmills because ministers of the ruling party were involved in the project.

The state government''s recent decision about starting the artificial rain project in May itself indicated that the government was sure that it was not going to rain naturally in western Maharashtra, he remarked. He also pointed out that many MLAs from the ruling party too have demanded that the windmills be kept closed during monsoon.

14,Dissident Akali leaders to launch new party,"FEROZEPUR: The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) is heading towards another breakaway in the party with dissident Akali leaders deciding to launch a new Akali party under the name of Shiromani Akali Dal (Sant Harchand Singh Longowal) on March 16th.

This was disclosed by senior Akali leader and former minister, Inderjit Singh Zira, here on Friday.

After Prem Singh Chandumajra, who had raised banner of revolt against Badal for not giving party ticket to him from Patiala Lok Sabha seat, Inderjit Singh Zira is the second Akali rebel who has decided to fight this election as an Independent from Ferozepur Lok Sabha seat.

While talking to the media persons, Zira said while announcing the candidates for the coming Lok Sabha polls in the state SAD has done injustice to the partyâ€™s loyalist. He accused Badal of entering into a secret understanding with Captain Amrinder Singh and accordingly weak candidates at most of the seats have been fielded by the SAD.

Rebellion has started brewing in the Shiromani Akali Dal after the party announced its candidates from ten Lok Sabha seats in the state. Not only leaders owing allegiance to the SGPC President, Gurcharan Singh Tohra, even those loyal to the SAD President have come out against candidature of some party candidates.

Senior SAD leader, Surjan Singh Thekedar had also registered his resentment against the nomination of Sharanjit Singh Dhillon from Ludhiana. Lambasting Badal for promoting nepotism in the party, Zira said the history of SAD clearly proves that anybody who dared to speak against the Badal or his style of functioning, politically assassinated by Badal.

He said Badal is concerned with the betterment of his family and he has nothing to do with the partyâ€™s well being and that''s why no parallel leadership has been groomed in the party.

While divulging the details of the new Akali Dal, Inderjit Singh Zira said an ultimatum has been given to SAD President for reviewing the candidature of some of the candidates and if Badal failed to respond the ultimatum before March 15, a new Shiromani Akali Dal (Sant Harchand Singh Longowal) would be floated on March 16th.

""In order to give tough fight to the S Â­ candidates on all the seats, we have planned to approach all the split Akali groups including Simranjit Singh Mann and Balwant Singh Ramoowalia to fight collectively against the SAD candidates,"" he added. When asked that who will head the new SAD(Longowal), Zira said it will be unanimously decided later on.

When asked whether SAD (Amritsar) would extend its support to new party SAD (Longowal), which is going to launch by the rebel SAD leaders, Mann said his party will contest these elections independently but at the same time any Akali rebel wishes to join his party would be welcomed.

16,Naresh Gujral's plunge into politics,"JALANDHAR: What could have drawn an old Stephanian and a successful businessman engaged in the export of fashion garments residing in the upmarket environs of Delhi into politics which has come to be synonymous with all that is menial and ''dirty'' in society.

From his airconditioned car Naresh Gujral would be stepping outside into the dust and grime of rural Doaba with temperatures already beginning to rise.

His launchpad would be Nakodar, an old Congress bastion. This would his first real election rally in Jalandhar constituency on Saturday, even as the other parties are still fumbling with nominees.

Parkash Singh Badal, the captain of the team would be introducing Naresh Gujral, who will be making a first attempt to define his specific agenda to the people.

""I am into politics at this stage after success in business because the educated and the urbane have so far been shunning it calling it ''dirty''. If we continue to complain about politics having become the last refuge of the SC then it is our fault. People like us should enter politics. Otherwise we are to blame for the ills of society,"" said Naresh who brings along with him a breeze of idealism and values so far missing from the political idiom.

Gujral junior when contacted on telephone said ""why are people excelling in business, in the arts, in fact in all activities of society, but not in politics. Why the standard of politics remained very poor. Its simply because the educated started shunning politics.""

Elaborating on his relationship with Jalandhar, he said "" my grandparents migrated to Jalandhar after the partition. My grandmother, Pushpa Gujral, was known here for her social work. Then I also wish to take up some of the unfinished works started by my father. The Science City at Kapurthala, the medical Institute and Damoria bridge are among these.""

As for his staying away from Jalandhar where he does not live, he said ""he would be coming off and on to Jalandhar, as even otherwise he would be expected to be in Delhi to attend to Parliament."" Naresh Gujral was born in 1948 in Jalandhar. His schooling and college was completed in Delhi. After graduating from Stephens College he qualified as a chartered accountant in 1973. He isw a keen sportsman and collector of Indian art. He is interested in Indian classical music.

17,EC says no to political ads on TV,"NEW DELHI: The Election Commission has decided not to permit poll-related advertisements on any television and channel, I&B minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said here on Friday.

This would also cover the official channel Doordarshan as well as All India Radio.

However, there was no law to regulate the activity for websites, the minister said.

Although the poll body is yet to announce its decision, Prasad said that the decision was expected after his ministry conveyed its ""limitations"" in monitoring numerous news and other TV channels in different languages across the country.

""We do not have the staff and equipment to monitor such a multifarious activity. We do not want to exercise police powers,"" Prasad told reporters.

He said that the ministry had also conveyed the ""potential for abuse"" in such an exercise with a party or an individual being subjected to an unfair attack.

He added that the ""India Shining"" and ""Bharat Uday"" campaigns would stop once the Election Commission''s notification for the poll dates was issued.

18,Pakistan to seek India's help for software development,"CHANDIGARH: Counting on Indian''s success story in information technology (IT) and taking advantage of a thaw in bilateral relations, Pakistan will approach India for help in developing its software sector.

Admitting India''s superiority in software and IT enabled services, Mian Anjum Nisar, the president of the Lahore Chambers of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) said a delegation of Pakistani software companies are likely to visit India in March and an Indian delegation will tour Pakistan later in the year to pursue possible cooperation.

""The purpose of such visit and association is not only to explore and cultivate IT trade opportunities, but also share Indian IT companies'' success and experience in providing high quality services and process management skills,'' said Vineet Virmani, former chairman of PHD Chambers of Commerce and Industry.

Junaid Iqbal Sheikh, a Lahore-based industrialist said that India is way ahead of us in IT but even in Pakistan the fever has caught up and so are looking for Indian support to set up IT training centres and developed centres. He also regretted that the country was being deprived of many companies that were willing to invest in this sector due to the unfriendly investment atmosphere.

In fact, several IT companies like Wipro, Aptech, NIIT have opened shops in several places including SAARC countries.

Aptech''s had chalked out a plan to capture about 20 percent of the global market in computer education, which is currently estimated to cross $1 billion by 2005. It has about 24 centres including SAARC countries.

As part of its expansion, Aptech plans to enter those markets where it does not have a presence and will focus on countries like China, Middle East, Africa, Singapore, Canada and SAARC (south Asian) nations. The Bangalore-based software giants Wipro Technologies has set up centres in China and its call centre unit Spectramind in Bangladesh.

Similarly, several IT majors like Pentasoft Technologies, Infosys and Satyam, who already have a global presence will look for skilled manpower available closer home, said the Nasscom official.

Recently, Microsoft International has recently provided assistance to National Commission for Human Development (NCHD) of Pakistan for setting up 16 information technology centres in the various Pakistan districts.
