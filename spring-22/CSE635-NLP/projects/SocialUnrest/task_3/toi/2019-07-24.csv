0,Karnataka ITES policy to be out in a month,"BANGALORE: The IT Task force headed by Karnataka chief minister S.M. Krishna has decided to float a special policy to boost the information technology-enabled services (ITES) sector in the state.

The policy, expected to be out within a month, will be drafted with a view to supporting the state''s mission to generate a million ITES jobs in the next 10 years.

The task force has made certain recommendations to the interim report, prepared jointly by Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) and McKinsey, on how to create a million jobs in IT services, hardware and business process outsourcing segment.

Briefing the media here on Monday, the state IT minister D.B. Inamdar said as per the recommendations, the government would focus on three areas including training, marketing and infrastructure development. The government will create a special marketing cell.

``All these recommendations will be incorporated in the policy. It is meant to give a marketing push to ITES activities and creating better training facilities, thereby projecting Karnataka as an ITES brand. It will also include promoting secondary centres like Hubli, Mysore, Mangalore and Dharward as ITES destinations,'''' he said.

Inamdar said the policy will contain various initiatives to attract foreign and external investments to Karnataka.

Speaking on the occasion, the state IT secretary Vivek Kulkarni said the smaller cities have higher growth potential than Bangalore since they were starting at lower bases. ``We only need to create conducive infrastructure.'''' Connectivity related issues are not seen to be a problem as the state already has 8.5 terrabyte line put up by Bharti, VSNL and STPI.

Commenting on the progress of the infrastructure corridor project, Kulkarni said the government will make the project plan available to the public and will accept suggestions from them before it is implemented.

1,Haryana govt rebuts Punjab statement,"CHANDIGARH: The Haryana government on Tuesday described as baseless and misleading the statement made by Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh alleging that Haryana had already been allocated excess water from the Ravi-Beas rivers.

Taking strong exception to the statement, Haryana chief parliamentary secretary Rampal Majra said it appeared as if either

Amarinder Singh himself was not aware of the facts or had been trying to mislead the people by projecting a distorted picture at a time when the Supreme Court had passed an order to complete the Satluj-Yamuna Link Canal (SYL) by January 15, 2003.He said the cultivable area of Punjab was 105 lakh acres and that of Haryana 95 lakh acres and not 80 lakh acres as assumed by Punjab.

Majra further said that Haryana had been allocated a total of 8.23 MAF of water which included 4.40 MAF of Satluj water (according to Bhakra Nangal agreement) and allocated 3.83 MAF by Ravi-Beas tribunal.

It appeared that while reviewing the allocation of water to Haryana, Amarinder might have wrongly added the waters of Yamuna being used by Haryana. Indus basin and Yamuna basin were two independent basins.

Majra said Amarinder was again wrong when he said Chautala had been reluctant to raise the issue during the regime of former Punjab chief minister Badal.

2,Kaushal murder: Case of mistaken identity not ruled out,"SOLAN: With no breakthrough into the investigation of the murder of the Chandigarh resident Manoj Kaushal, a number of theories are being worked at as police tries to tie loose ends together.

Incidents unfolding one after the other have left behind a number of unanswered questions. Naresh Bansalâ€™s scooter was stolen just two days before the mishap whereas its FIR was lodged on Friday. The scooter thief not only risked staying in the town till Saturday but also decided to drive the scooter in front of Bansalâ€™s shop on the day Kaushal had arrived there from Chandigarh.

Instead of Bansal following the scooterist, he asked Kaushal to follow him in his car. The fact that the assailant had covered his face and was carrying a weapon makes the whole matter more complex. SP SZH Zaidi said that the police was working at these loose ends though it was premature to conclude anything at the moment.

The probability of the assailant being a vehicle thief is not being ruled out as he has left behind a bunch of car and scooter keys. But when contacted, the family members of the deceased didnâ€™t deny that it could have been a well-planned murder.

They said that Kaushal had received a call from Bansal, whom he had known since past six months, on Friday asking him to come to Solan the following day. They were unaware if Kaushal had any enemy and added that he had left home in a relaxed mood on Saturday morning.

The police also does not rule out a case of mistaken identity. It is to be noted that a stolen Tata Indica involved in the murder of a businessman was stolen from near his house last year. It was later recovered in Panipat. It is also learnt that his brother was kidnapped in 1990.

While not ruling out the possibility of mistaken identity with rivalry being the cause, officials said that it could be the work of a professional killer who could have been assigned the job of killing Naresh Bansal. Inquiries made by Times News Network do not put Naresh Bansal in a favourable light.

The local police has sought the help of the police from the neighbouring states of Punjab, Haryana and the union territory Chandigarh.

The police had circulated computerised sketches of the assailant and had also received information, but none helped in providing any headway, added the SP.

The police interrogated Naresh Bansal on Tuesday after he arrived here from Chandigarh. The brother of the deceased also met the SP. Meetings were going on till late in the evening to decide the course of action in the office of the SP.

3,Scholarship scam accused arrested,"HYDERABAD: One of the prime accused in the multi-crore scholarship scam D Shanker Rao was arrested by the central crime station police on Monday.

Among the many belongings seized from Shanker Rao there was a CD in which he recorded himself having sex with a woman.

According to a police press release, a separate case in this regard would be filed against Rao apart from the various charges he was already accused of in connection with the scholarship scam.

Shanker Rao (48), an accountant with the pay and accounts office, floated bogus colleges and by presenting bogus bills for post-matric scholarships collected crores of rupees.

A resident of Kamalapuri Colony, Rao and his colleague Mothiya Naik were helped by officers with the social welfare, tribal welfare and BC welfare departments.

The police had already arrested over 10 people, including the deputy director of social welfare department Shambhavi in connection with the case.

As on date, Shanker Rao possesses bank accounts with Rs 25 lakh net balance. He owns 65 properties.

5,ARR blow to farmers and domestic consumers,"LUCKNOW: The Annual Revenue Requirement (ARR) report submitted by the Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation to the Uttar Pradesh Power Regulatory Commission does not bear happy tidings for the domestic consumers or the farming community.

The proposed ARR was submitted to the commission on Tuesday. A meeting between the corporation and the government officials is slated for Wednesday following which the commission would take a final decision on accepting or rejecting the proposals submitted. The proposed ARR fixes the revenue generation at Rs 8931 crores as opposed to the Rs 6748 crores generated currently.

The UPPCL board of directors, which met on Monday, had deliberated on the ARR in accordance with which the domestic consumers have been burdened with a 47 per cent tariff hike.

Reportedly, the proposal submitted fixes the rate for light and fan at Rs 3.50 per unit for the first 50 units consumed. The rate for the next 250 units has also been fixed at Rs 3.50 per unit. Upwards of 250 units the rate has been hiked to Rs 3.90 per unit.

If the domestic consumer is being made to bear the brunt the farming community has not been left behind. The private tube-well owners have been burdened with a 209 per cent hike. It has been proposed that all private 10 hose power tube-wells will be charged Rs 1.70 per hose power and those above 10 hose power Rs 1.75 per hose power per month. Till now the farmers were paying Rs 55 per month for such tube-wells.

While no tariff hike has been proposed for the small and medium industries, the large and heavy industries are being burdened with an 11 per cent hike. The rates proposed here have been fixed for different categories between Rs 3 to Rs 3.35 and Rs 3.75 per unit.

Private institutions like schools will reportedly have to shell out Rs 3.50 per unit for the first 300 units consumed and Rs 4 per unit for upwards of 300 units.

The proposed ARR has drawn considerable flak from the general secretary of the All India Power Engineers Federation Shailendra Dubey. Slamming the Corporation officials, he said it was for the first time that domestic consumers were being charged more by way of electricity consumed than the industries.

The farming community had also not been spared, he stressed. Dubey minced no words when he said that the propsoed 209 per cent hike had been made at the behest of the World Bank to cripple the agriculture sector. He said if the revenue realisation of the Corporation was taken into consideration, then the income earned from the farm sector was a mere 9 per cent of the total, that of the domestic 23 per cent and the industry 34 per cent. Hence, it made no sense to spare the small and medium industries and burden the remaining twe sectors, he added.

6,Vigilance body seeks developmental control,"Kolkata: The West Bengal Vigilance Commission has asked the state government to bring all the development agencies in the state under its purview.

The recommendation comes in for a mention in the commissionâ€™s annual report tabled in the state assembly recently.

â€œThe Commission has noted with concern that certain sectors dealing with developmental work in the state are not within the ambit of the Commission, and consequently peopleâ€™s confidence is shaken when it is found that erring officers or employees responsible for misusing public money cannot be proceeded against,â€� the Commissionâ€™s stated in its report.

The commission referred to 35 cases where investigations into alleged corrupt practices were closed following non-cooperation, sustained inaction and negligent handling by the concerned departments.

In a startling revelation, the commission has cited the case of a departmental enquiry against two officers of home (civil defence) department in 1977. More than 20 years have elapsed since, but no intimation has been made regarding the action taken by the department despite several rejoinders.

In another instance involving a probation officer in Malda alleged to have prepared false travel allowance bills, the Commission had recommended financial penalty and a steep pay reduction. However, the documents were lost in transit and no action was taken thereafter.

The lackadaisical attitude of the state government in setting up Lok Ayuktas also came in for severe criticism by the commission.

â€œThough an expectation was reflected in the last report of the commission in the matter of setting up of Lok Ayuktas for dealing with corruption against peopleâ€™s representatives of all levels, unfortunately no positive response is perceptible in this regard uptill now. It is high time the government gave a serious thought in order to ensure more transparency in the financial dealings and ensure accountability of the authorities.

7,Sinha’s colleagues protest 'cop terror',"KOLKATA: Can the police arrest a government employee, or for that matter, any citizen, in the middle of the night based on suspicion and without arrest warrant?

This was raised by the Association of Commercial Tax Services on Tuesday in the wake of the arrest and suicide of Central Excise and Customs inspector Abhijit Sinha in Kolkata recently.

Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had supported the swoop on Sinhaâ€™s place claiming that the latter had connection with the CPI(ML) Peopleâ€™s War.

ACTS, however, strongly protested the police action and expressed concern over the threat to jobs and security of government employees following Bhattacharjeeâ€™s nod to the police to strike against the Maoists and other subversive forces.

Citing examples of detention of some commercial tax department personnel without prior information or permission from the department, the association said no government staff should be arrested without the written permission of his or her superior.

Neither should one be arrested without specific charges and the police would have to issue arrest memos to his kin stating the charges, detaineeâ€™s destination, physical condition and names and designations of the arresting officers, they said.

The association also demanded that the government should repeal the â€˜colonial legacyâ€™ of suspending its employees if they were detained for more than 48 hours.

â€œWhat we are asking for is nothing new but the implementation of the Supreme Court directives regarding the arrest of any citizen. Those were issued to ensure human rights and to make the police and government accountable to the public,â€� said association secretary Amiya Pal.

Meanwhile, the Bandi Mukti Committee criticised the arrest of 20 villagers since March in Midnapore. It added that all the arrested would suffer immensely if they were kept behind bars during the sowing season.

8,PAC chief says govt ignored panel reports,"PATNA: Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) Ramdeo Verma informed the Bihar assembly on Tuesday that the government had failed to act on the recommendations of the PAC, which led to several wasteful expenditures. It was for the first time in the history of the legislative assembly in the country that a debate was held on the reports of the PAC which were tabled earlier. In 1966, the Lok Sabha had organised discussion on a PAC report. Initiating the debate, Verma lamented that the government did not take the committeeâ€™s recommendations seriously. It might have cost the poor state several crore rupees, he said. To cite an example, he said health and education departments spent a whopping Rs 3 crore during the current financial year in court cases for the failure to promptly deal with problems of pension, promotion and seniority of its employees.

9,Cabinet okays new quota policy,"PATNA: The Bihar cabinet at its meeting on Tuesday approved a new reservation policy. A bill to amend the Bihar Reservation of Vacancies in Posts and Services (For SC, ST and other backward classes) Act, 1991 to give effect to the decision is likely to be moved in the current session of the legislature. According to the decision, the quota for scheduled tribes has been slashed from 10 per cent to one per cent. On the other hand, the reservation for scheduled castes has been hiked from 12 per cent to 16 per cent. The quota for extremely backward castes has been hiked from 14 per cent to 18 per cent, for backward castes from 10 per cent to 12 per cent, and for backward caste women from 2 per cent to 3 per cent. This is a change from the previously announced policy when the government had approved 15 per cent quota for the SCs and 13 per cent for the backward castes. The government maintained that after bifurcation of Bihar, the population of the scheduled caste in the state was 15.47 per cent, and hence it was thought appropriate to increase the quota to 16 per cent. The quota for backward castes was reduced by one per cent in view of the upper limit for reservation of 50 per cent. The cabinet decision comes a day after an all-party meet was held in the office of the chief minister in the assembly building. The leader of the opposition, Sushil Kumar Modi, had suggested raising the percentage of reservation for different categories above 50 per cent on the pattern of the formula adopted by Jharkhand government. But the state government decided to stick to a maximum of 50 per cent reservation as the Constitution does not allow reservation beyond this. The quota for the ST has been reduced as their population in Bihar following bifurcation of the state is only one per cent as per the 1991 census. The CPI has criticised the decision.

11,"Decision on Gujarat polls soon, says EC","NEW DELHI: The Election Commission on Wednesday told a high-level BJP delegation led by party president M Venkaiah Naidu that its demand for early elections in Gujarat would be discussed and a decision taken soon.

Emerging from a half-an-hour meeting with Chief Election Commissioner J M Lyngdoh and two other commissioners, T S Krishnamurthy and B B Tandon, Naidu said that ""the Commission informed the delegation that it will discuss the demand and take an early decision."" The BJP president said the delegation told the three-member Commission that the state government was within its right to recommend dissolution of the Assembly and the Governor rightly accepted it.

""There is no law and order problem in the state,"" he said.

Naidu charged the Opposition with shying away from the elections. ""The Opposition is not prepared for elections and there is no provision to delay the polls. I hope the Election Commission will take an early decision,"" he said. He said elections were held in Punjab and Assam where there were tension earlier.

On the Opposition demand for President''s rule in the state, Naidu asked whether it was prepared for President''s rule in 10 states which are due for polls next year.

12,Left Front rules out conditional talks with PWG,"KOLKATA: West Bengal''s ruling Left Front on Wednesday ruled out any conditional talks with the People''s War which, it said, follows the path of terror and annihilation.

Referring to the PWG''s offer of conditional talks, the CPI-M state secretary, Anil Biswas, told newsmen after the Front meeting that there would not be any conditional talks with them. ""We have not received any offer of such talks from them"".

Biswas said the Front also condemned the policy of terror and annihiliation followed by PWG.

Asked about reported police excesses against PWG activists, he said that the Human Rights Commission would look into it.

The PWG in a statement here on July 16 had said that it was willing to hold talks with the government provided CPI-M leaders particularly in Midnapore, Bankura and Purulia, removed the stockpiles of arms and public meetings were allowed at all villages.

13,Only city-bound trucks to be allowed in,"NEW DELHI: Trucks not carrying goods for Delhi will not be allowed to enter the city from July 27. Those violating the order will be stopped and turned back, the Delhi traffic police have said.

A decision to the effect was taken at a high-level meeting chaired by the Union cabinet secretary on Wednesday. The move comes days before the Supreme Court hearing on July 29 on environment issues. The court had ordered a ban on trucks not destined for Delhi, as they add to the pollution and road accidents in the city.

However, trucks carrying grains, vegetables and fruits for the city will not be stopped. The trucks will be checked for their contents when they stop to pay their toll.

â€˜â€˜The order will be enforced from Saturday. We have asked the Delhi Municipal Corporation not to collect toll from goods vehicles not destined for Delhi,'''' said Maxwell Pereira, joint commissioner of police (traffic).

Representatives from neighbouring states, who attended the meeting, have been asked to create proper infrastructure and put up road signs. â€˜â€˜These are necessary so that the trucks may take diversions much before they reach Delhi''s borders,'''' an official said.

About 60,000 trucks enter the city every day. Of these about 15,000 are in transit. The ban, which comes more than seven months after the Supreme Court''s order, is likely to help reduce pollution in the city. The trucks use diesel with high sulphur levels which emits polluting fumes.

15,Union ministers have little to declare,"KOLKATA: Three years ago, a city businessman paid Rs 3.09 lakh in income-tax.With a declared annual income of Rs 8.7 lakh for 1997-98, he was in the highest tax bracket.

Though he coughed up over a third of his earnings, a veteran politician and senior member of the Vajpayee government declared an equal income but paid only Rs 53,000 in tax the same year. Another minister declared an annual income of Rs 1.59 lakh but paid no tax. Yet another declared an annual income of Rs 5.17 lakh the same year.

His royal lineage was apparent in the assets declared â€“ a property in Rajasthan worth Rs 1 crore, a Rs 8-lakh flat in Jaipur, two flats in Delhi worth Rs 132.5 lakh and a Rs 6.5-lakh farm house. He also declared 40 cows, Rs 2.5 lakh worth of jewellery and Rs 89.85 lakh cash in bank apart from Rs 30.76 lakh investment.

All these ministers, pointed out in reports this week, had declared their assets and income-tax paid in 1998 but did not update declarations in the next four years. Most of them had declared annual incomes of Rs 2.5-9 lakh and yet paid a fourth of the tax that salaried employees with similar income pay. â€œPoliticians hoard assets that are disproportionate to their known source of income without being penalised. While citizens are told to feel proud about paying tax, it never seems to apply to politicians,â€� the businessman said.

A high-profile Union minister from Maharashtra, however, took the easy way out and declared modest assets. But despite a paltry annual income of Rs 60,000 and Rs 24,000 cash in the bank, he had paid Rs 6 lakh to book a 1,200 sq ft flat in Mumbai, had jewellery worth Rs 4.5 lakh and two LIC policies worth Rs 1.9 lakh!

â€œMost often, people suppress income. Politicians are no different,â€� an I-T official said, adding that they often take recourse to â€œagricultureâ€� to shield their income since it is not taxed. â€œIt is no secret that politicians have kept agriculture out of the tax net to suit their own interest.â€� â€œWhile a few politicians have genuine agriculture assets, most show agriculture income that may find little credibility if investigated. Others invest large sums in RBI bonds that are tax-free. However, the source of such funds can always be investigated,â€� the I-T official said.

Most politicians also hoard assets in the name of their spouseâ€™s parents. Since in-lawsâ€™ assets are not clubbed with the assesseeâ€™s, it is convenient to park money with them.

Though politicians in Bihar have been raided by the I-T department, the big fish in Delhi have so far remained unscathed. â€œIf one inquires into the assets of politicians and bureaucrats, the country will be richer,â€� says former MP Gurudas Dasgupta. Unpaid tax amounts to a whopping Rs 65,000 crore. Union ministers have little to declare

16,Cong activist commits suicide after killing woman,"MUMBAI: A 45-year-old Congress activist committed suicide at his Chembur residence on Tuesday after allegedly murdering a 41-year-old woman at Hotel Plaza, near Chembur station.

The police are probing several theories, including a possible love affair between the two or previous enmity.

In his suicide note, Kamalsingh Thakur said, â€œI am depressed because of huge debts.â€™â€™

He reportedly hanged himself with a nylon rope. The woman has been identified as Babli Sharma, a bar dancer and a resident of Andheri.

The police said Mr Thakur had checked into the hotel along with the woman on Monday. He left the hotel on Tuesday morning. In the afternoon, the attendants opened the door of the room with a duplicate key as a strong stench emanated from it.

On opening the door, they found the woman lying dead on the bed, strangulated with her dupatta. The room had been booked in a fake name. In the evening, the police learnt about Mr Thakurâ€™s suicide.

â€œThe hotelâ€™s receptionist confirmed that Mr Thakur was indeed the person who had checked into the hotel, the previous day,â€™â€™ assistant commissioner Y.D. Tapase said.

17,Dharna against anti-superstition law on Aug 6,"MUMBAI: Social activists will hold a dharna on August 6 to highlight the need for legislation to prevent regressive practices such as human sacrifice.

The dharna has been organised by the Andhashradha Nirmoolan Samiti (ANS), an organisation involved in exposing frauds and miracles committed by â€˜godmenâ€™ and quacks as part of its programme to fight superstition.

N.D. Patil, former chief of the coordination committee of the Democractic Front, noted actor Dr Shreeram Lagoo, former high court judge Chandrashekhar Dharmadhikari and social activist Pushpa Bhave will join the dharna.

According to activists, only a stringent anti-superstition law can curb regressive practices such as human sacrifice.

The murder of a nine-year-old boy in Ambernath at the behest of a â€˜babaâ€™ and the narrow escape of another boy in Mumbra last week underscore the need for such a law, they said. The Democratic Front government had, as part of its common minimum programme, promised to pass an antisuperstition law.

Samiti leader Dr Narendra Dabholkar told TNN that the Maharashtra legislative council had passed a resolution in 1995 to pass a law against superstition. This was the result of a resolution moved by several members, including Venkappa Patki (Janata Dal) and D.B. Patil (Peasants and Workers Party). The then home minister Gopinath Munde had accepted the need for an enactment on the issue.

A bill has been already drafted by experts, including Mr Chandrashekhar, judge Dharmadhikari, former advocate general Raja Bhosale, former state law secretary M.B. Pawar former home secretary Bhaskar Misar and former minister Dadasaheb Rupawate and others.

The bill makes a distinction between faith and superstition. It has classified as superstitious a number of practices including claims to possess godly powers, resorting to sorcery, chaining patients and assaulting them to â€œexorcise ghostsâ€™â€™, resorting to animal sacrifice, promising fertility through supernatural powers and performing miracles in the name of deities.

According to Dr Dabholkar, action can be taken on the basis of the Drugs and Magic Remedies Act of 1954 against bogus cures and medicines. But a majority of police officers arenâ€™t aware of the legislation. Action can also be taken on the charge of cheating under section 420 of the IPC, but this provision is seldom invoked, he added..

Thousands of people have been victimised by some unscrupulous persons claiming to have supernatural powers.

Some years ago, a number of childless couples from the state went to Bhavnagar, Gujarat, to meet a woman claiming to have special powers given by Lord Shankara. A few complaints were filed, but no action could be taken by the Maharashtra government in this case.

Two months ago, one Aslam Breadwale attracted big crowds in Miraj and Narsobaji Wadi for a cure for bladder stone and appendix. The Samiti intervened after getting many complaints, but the Baba escaped.
