0,Pawar slams disinvestment,"PUNE: Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) president Sharad Pawar on Thursday lashed out at the Centreâ€™s disinvestment policy for its â€œlack of directionâ€�.

Addressing a meeting of traders and merchants organised by the Poona Merchantsâ€™ Chamber here on Thursday, Pawar also ridiculed the recent decision of the Union government to allow the joint venture between Maersk India and the Container Corporation of India to build and operate the third container terminal at Nhava Sheva.

â€œI need not elaborate how important the ports are from the security point of view. We are all from the land of Shivaji Maharaj, who had given top priority to guarding the ports,â€� Pawar said.

Pawar particularly lashed out against the Union disinvestment minister Arun Shourie, saying, â€œEvery day, he (Shourie) proudly announces the names of companies sold. Dismantling a company is easy but establishing and running it needs brains.â€�

Accusing the Centre of wrongly interpreting the â€œliberalisationâ€� policy, Pawar said, â€œIt does not mean giving unconditional entry to foreign companies. Industries in Maharashtra are suffering and many are on the verge of closure. The prices of steel and cement are going up. The time has come for radical economic reforms like those in 1991.â€�

He also condemned the central sugar-export policy and appealed to traders and merchants to support the Congress-NCP to save the sector in the country.

Rajya Sabha member Suresh Kalmadi, state industries minister Patangrao Kadam and senior Congress leaders Suresh Jain and Vijay Darda were also present at the meeting.

Reliable sources in the NCP revealed that after the meeting with the traders, Pawar held a closed-door meeting with top Congress leaders from the district in a bid to patch up the differences and settle the disputes between Congress and NCP workers.

1,DF government may dissolve assembly,"MUMBAI: The Democratic Front (DF) government may go in for an early dissolution of the state legislative assembly to avoid the â€œunpleasantâ€™â€™ move of sacking 24 ministers from its 58-member jumbo ministry, political observers said.

Chief minister Sushilkumar Shinde will have to prune the size of his ministry following the central law which states that the size of the ministry should be restricted to 15 per cent of the size of the assembly, which comes into effect from January 7, 2004.

â€œIn all probability the state legislative assembly may be dissolved after the elections to the Rajya Sabha and the state legislative council. Prior to that we will also table our full-fledged budget,â€™â€™ a senior DF functionary told TNN on Thursday. The DF is presently surviving on the support of 10 Independents, a majority of whom have been given ministerial berths.

Should the government taken any decision to sack any of the Independents they are bound to withdraw support resulting in that government being reduced to a minority status, a political observer said.

2,Scrap at airport over acquiring vehicles for polls,"MUMBAI: A scuffle broke out between Air-India employees and officials of the Andheri Regional Transport Office (RTO) and Mumbai suburban collectorâ€™s office at Sahar airport on Thursday after the officials tried requisitioning some vehicles belonging to AI for election duty.

The demand was met with protests by the A-I employees as the collectorâ€™s office, which requisitions vehicles for elections, had reportedly not sent a formal request to A-I, as required in such cases. â€œThey have now given a note demanding 10 air-conditioned vehicles,â€™â€™ said Jitendra Bhargava, director, public relations, A-I. He said A-I would consider the request on Friday.

The incident took place at around 6 p.m. when A-Iâ€™s jeeps and tractor vehicles were ferrying engineers, technical staff and cabin-catering goods near the airport area.

Uniformed and plainclothes officials stopped the vehicles, confiscated the licenses of the drivers and told them to report to the Andheri RTO office on Friday for election duty,â€™â€™ according to A-I sources.

A similar attempt was reportedly made to requisition three MMRDA vehicles. â€œThis is not the way to function. The job should be done in a decent manner,â€™â€™ said an angry MMRDA official. Mumbai suburban collector S S Zende could not be contacted for comments.

3,"MCC, Sena men clash, one killed","GAYA: MCC and Ranvir Sena, the two banned organisations operating in Gaya district, exchanged heavy fire near village Mok under the Konch police station on Thursday morning.

According to reports reaching the district headquarters, Sidhnath Sharma, said to be a Ranvir Sena supporter was killed by the MCC men. The MCC, on its part, did not suffer any casualty.

This is the second incident of Naxal violence within a few days in the Konch area. Earlier, last week three persons were killed by the Naxalites in village Mok under the same police station.

Soon after the killing of Sidhnath Sharma, villagers from Mok and other adjoining areas laid a siege around the Dhanchui police picket and pelted stones on the police picket. No one was injured in the stone pelting incident.

The villagers alleged that the Dhanchui police picket men did not act swiftly to intercept the Naxalites. Confirming the death of Sidhnath Sharma, Ajit Kumar, additional district magistrate (Naxal operations), said that the situation in the area was under control. After much persuasion, the villagers of Mok allowed the body of Sharma to be lifted for post-mortem. The ADM denied that there was higher casualty in the fight. In another incident in the district, the body of Jagtar Paswan was found near village Manhama under the Tekari police station of the district. Paswan was earlier abducted from the village.

Personal enmity is said to have led to the abduction and subsequent killing.

5,Medha Patkar's party to contest elections,"MUMBAI: Activist Medha Patkar has announced the formation of the People''s Political Front, which will contest a limited number of seats in either the Lok Sabha or assembly elections.

She said that the PPF has been jointly launched by different movements in the country which come under the umbrella of the National Alliance of People''s Movements.

Patkar said the first priority of the PPF would be to defeat the National Democratic Alliance, led by the ""communal and fundamentalist"" BJP.

She said the PPF was politically close to Left parties, but not averse to the Congress, since its strategy was to prevent the splintering of secular votes.

Patkar said no decision had been taken on whether she would contest the Lok Sabha polls against Suresh Prabhu of the Shiv Sena in Maharashtra''s Rajapur constituency.

Prabhu heads the task force implementing the river inter-linking project, to which Patkar is opposed.

6,'68 pc voters to get photo-IDs before polls',"LUCKNOW: By the time the first phase of polling in Uttar Pradesh begins, 68 per cent of the electorate would get their photo-ID cards. As of now only 48 per cent of voters have been supplied with the cards.

According to chief electoral officer Vijay Sharma, the percentage of photo-ID cards could go up further if more officials showed proficiency in work.

Drive for the photo-ID cards had begun in 1995, but had to be shelved midway due to a variety of reasons, stated an EC official.

However, due to EC''s insistence, officials were asked to put in effort in a concerted way to accomplish the task on time.

Some officials entrusted with the task of photo-ID card work were pulled up by the government for their inefficiency.

7,New rule for captive elephants,"LUCKNOW: An expert committee constituted by the Centre, that was studying the status of captive elephants across the country, has issued radical new directions to help forest officials keep track of such pachyderms.

Members of the expert committee met the chief wildlife wardens of Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Bihar and Tamil Nadu in New Delhi on Wednesday, and discussed the status of captive elephants in these states.

In the light of the misuse of ownership certificates by elephant owners, the committee had ordered the implementation of the micro-chip method to keep a tab on captive elephants.

""A micro-chip or transponder bearing the identity number of the captive elephant would be implanted in the elephant''s ear while a similar chip would be at the chief wildlife warden''s office,"" said Lucknow Zoo director Eva Sharma, who represented the chief wildlife warden of UP at the meeting in Delhi.

This would help forest officials keep a track of the whereabouts of each captive elephant. ""Several elephant owners had been cheating the administration by keeping more than one elephant on a single ownership certificate, which led to the misuse of the elephants.""

While discussing the problems of controlling wild elephants during the meeting, Eva Sharma appealed for the setting up of local units to facilitate tranquilisation of elephants, after numerous incidents of wild elephants going on the rampage have occurred in the state.

""Veterinary doctors at the Kanpur and Lucknow zoos are the only officials who are rushed to the scenes of such incidents,"" Sharma complained.

The zoo director has also suggested that the elephant populations in Dudhwa National Park, Katraniaghat Wildlife Sanctuary and Ranipur Wildlife Sanctuary and others be increased, as they have the required resources to sustain elephant populations.

8,Mulayam enumerates 5 lies of NDA rule,"BARA BANKI: Chief minister and Samajwadi Party president Mulayam Singh Yadav on Thursday wondered that if India was shining and everyone was feeling good as propagated by the BJP then why the need for deputy prime minister LK Advani to take out his Bharat Uday Yatra from Kanyakumari to Kashmir.

""Sab kuch ho raha hai to rath kyon chal rahein hain"" was his query about BJP''s sloganeering and Advani''s yatra.

Mulayam, who was addressing a well-attended election meeting here, chose the occasion to announce the name of the SP candidates from both the Bara Banki (reserved) and Kaiserganj parliamentary constituencies.

While Ram Sagar Rawat would be party candidate from Bara Banki, former Union minister Beni Prasad Verma will contest from Kaiserganj.

Both Rawat and Verma were sitting MPs in the dissolved Lok Sabha and are still rated heavyweights in their respective constituencies majorly on account of the caste equations which work in their favour.

While Rawat is a Pasi, Verma is a Kurmi. Both these castes predominate in the respective constituencies of the duo and play a decisive role in deciding the fate of the candidates.

Mulayam, who began his election speech by asking for ''sahyog'' (help) for the Samajwadi Party, came down heavily on BJP and its top two leaders Prime Minister Vajpayee and LK Advani.

He listed the ''five lies'' which the BJP had spoken and asked the electorate to keep them in mind.

The lies listed were the ''false'' slogans of ''India shining'' and the ''feel good'' factor pervading the country, the promise of 1 crore jobs made by Vajpayee to the unemployed, constant harping on being an honest (imaandar) party in the face of innumerable scams, its talks of patriotism (desh bhakti) when the frontiers remained unprotected or the Parliament was attacked and the constant spiralling prices of all goods.

He also hit out at the VHP and said it was the same organisation which had once said that ''Advani ne desh ko kalankati kiya hai'', but was today singing paens for him and Vajpayee and abusing the SP. Mulayam said the BJP had two faces and two manifestoes.

Maintaining that the people had lost all faith in the national parties, he said both BJP and BSP were in essence one party and that an understanding had been reached between the two.

The SP president however appeared soft on the Congress when he observed that he would not speak about the party as on one hand it was extending support to him in UP and on the other it was not in the electoral fray at all.

Listing the achievements of his government during its six months in the office, he asked the constituents to ensure that the SP attained the status of a national party.

9,Wife survives suicide pact,"KOLKATA: A 27-year-old aeronautical engineer died on Thursday morning while his wife still battles for her life in a south Kolkata nursing home from suspected poisoning.

The couple had locked themselves in the bedroom since Tuesday night. Kaushik Chatterjee and his wife Baishali, 31, a psychology postgraduate, were unemployed.

They had married after a whirlwind courtship in May 2003, months after meeting at the Moulali Yuva Kendra, where Kaushik went to teach computers.

Baishali''s family members complained that Kaushik had poisoned her before killing himself.

Her relative N.J. Das claimed there were injury marks on her face and body. Kaushik''s father Asoke Chatterjee refused to comment.

The two were last seen together on Tuesday night having dinner at their 101, Shyambazar Street residence.

Till late on Wednesday morning, they did not emerge from their room, nor did they respond to frantic knocks by Kaushik''s parents.

Around 2.20 pm, the police were called and they broke open the door. The two were lying on the bed with three water bottles beside them.

The bottles contained a pink fluid. They were immediately taken to the R.G. Kar Hospital. Kaushik died after 12 hours. Baishali''s relatives shifted her to the Belle Vue Hospital. Her condition is serious.

Police suspected that marital discord because of unemployment had prompted the couple to take the step. According to locals, Kaushik was not talking to his parents for the last 15 days.

""The house is a divided one with each of the four brothers including Kaushik''s father living separately in the same building. About a fortnight ago, Kaushik had a quarrel with his parents and they stopped taking dinner together,"" said a neighbour.

Police said the couple did not have any money and depended on Kaushik''s father, a customs employee.

Kaushik had started a tutorial at his home, but it was not giving much results.

Baishali''s family said the two would often go to her parents home at Ebrahimpur Road, Jadavpur, claiming that Kaushik''s family had thrown them out. Kaushik also asked for money at times on the plea that Baishali needed psychiatric help.

DC (north) P. Ravi said the probe would primarily hinge on Baishali''s statement.

10,Naidu shows off 'clean rule',"HYDERABAD: Chandrababu Naidu seems set on hardselling his good governance agenda to the Andhra voter as a shield against the Telengana missiles being fired by his rivals.

Ranged on his side is a likely army of 65 lakh women, success stories in empowerment thanks to a central government scheme that has helped them with credit and savings.

Despite the success of the Dwcra scheme for women, the opposition has been harping on the TDP''s urban bias. Their contention: Development has not touched villages.

They don''t dispute the fact that the government was combating a mega drought, but in the same breath claim Naidu is too focused on peddling the IT dream.

While the state inched up the development scale, the core issues - water, power and farmers'' problems - remained neglected.

Andhra Pradesh is a downstream state and all the rivers that cut through its terrain get water from Karnataka and Maharashtra.

The drought hit these two neighbours as well. The rivers dried up and whatever surplus water used to spill over into AP stopped.

Consequence: Water wars. Much of the saber rattling on this count was between AP and Karnataka, with S M Krishna insisting Karnataka had nothing to spare.

An area of concern has been Telangana. With elections approaching, this is the cause celebre. Telugu Desam says it has floated schemes to pull the Naxalite-infested poorer regions out of the morass. But these will take more time to show results.

Indeed schemes such as Janmabhoomi, where the community identifies a project and the government and the community execute together are unique. They''ve been in action and might be showing some difference.

But corruption has been Naidu''s bane. In many cases, his party cadre has let him down. The CM has been upfront about his problems in Telangana.

He concedes the naxalite problem stops industry from coming into these areas. Naidu says law and order remain the biggest deterrent to the flow of capital to the region. But, for the PW member, underdevelopment remains his key weapon.

He sells his logic of violence on the premise of poverty. Every other day, there''s news of encounters. The opposition calls it a bullet raj and is at the same time accused by the ruling party of being hand in glove with the PW.

The Congress doesn''t give much credence to the CM''s barbs. Arrest us under Pota if you''ve proof of complicity, is what its leaders say. Though none of them support the killings, they blame the TDP for the PW''s run of terror.

""There isn''t any development. Naxalism thrives on situations such as these,"" says a Congress official.

But Naidu appears unfazed by this battle of words. He has kept his campaign on an even keel, saying good governance is the USP. He hard sells Telugu pride.

His claim: Delhi eats out of his hands. While PCC members queue up outside Sonia Gandhi''s chamber for a minute of her time, world leaders listen to him. The PM spares time for him. Naidu''s punch line: Congressmen are Ghulams of Azad.

11,Reform labour laws for apparel: Study,"NEW DELHI: India could emerge as hub for apparel outsourcing but will have to undertake reforms in key areas like labour, besides entering into bilateral trade agreements with US and European Union to become competitive, says McKinsey.

""India could be the next biggest winner after China... It could grow exports at 15-18% and reach $25-30 billion by 2013 if reforms are implemented. While some progress has been made, key reforms are required and attracting more foreign direct investment would require changing labour laws,"" McKinsey said in a report on Indian textile and apparel sector.

Pointing that quota restrictions on apparel exports under Multi Fibre Agreement will end in 2005, it suggested signing of bilateral trade agreements with US and EU under quota-free regime to be competitive against other low cost producers such as Sri Lanka.

It emphasised on investments in technology and relationships with right customers, improvement in organisations.
