1,DM urges govt to fix norms in regularisation,"allahabad: the controversy regarding the process of regularisation of government press daily wage employees against vacant posts, has taken a new twist with the intervention of the district magistrate. he is learnt to have written to the industrial development secretary for fixing norms at an early date to avoid tension between the employees and the authorities. at the end of his two-page suggestion, the dm also sought proper guidance in the matter. the letter has also briefed the secretary about the stands of both parties. the dm has urged the secretary to take an early decision and formulate a firm policy which the director of the government press would be obliged to implement. he also suggested that senior government officials could even hold meetings with the parties here in allahabad or at lucknow for finding an amicable solution to minimise the tense situation. mr chaturvedi wrote that due to the dispute often the district administration and the police were forced to intervene. the continuous dharna / agitation by the employees also gives rise to a law and order problem and a few untoward incidents did occur. it was after those incidents that he called the director and the employees for talks. one reason for the tension was that even after interview for 30 posts, results were not declared. the director claimed that since the representative of backward category was not present, the interview was postponed. the dm thought that since it was quite a sensitive issue, the press authorities should have shown more seriousness. the director could have deputed some other person. the dm has asked the director to declare the results soon. the main point of dispute, however, was the regularisation of 180 employees. the employee leaders said that there were indeed 180 vacant posts and the director was not willing to fill them, it was alleged. on the contrary, the director said the posts were not new and that the posts of coolies were changed into labour class posts as such these were not extra posts and the process of coolies being appointed to these pots was going on. the employee leaders were also demanding appointments on vacant technical posts.

6,More Naxal violence apprehended in Bihar: Report,"patna: prime minister atal bihari vajpayee, speaking at the gandhi maidan here on sunday, gave a call to naxalites to shun violence and said they should instead fight at the indo-pakistan border. if the extremists indeed heed the pm's call, the nation will have many more fighters to defend its borders. or so seems to suggest an assessment report on red terror prepared by the state police. according to the report, left extremism has grown in bihar in the past two years, especially since the creation of jharkhand, at the cost of the moderate left. the report refers to the growing threat after the merger of peoples' war and party unity. the peoples' war in bihar is more systematic, calculative and expansionist of all the naxalite outfits. this organisation is well versed in explosive techniques and generally targets policemen ruthlessly, the report notes. it points to the demoralisation that set in the bihar police after the pw entered the state and has stressed on the need to sensitise the police force to the security aspects. besides, the report expresses concern over the increasing cases of landmine blasts, deaths of policemen and loss of police weapons. the report notes that both the pw and mcc have been growing at the cost of moderate left parties, like cpi(ml), cpi and cpm, among others. it sees a dangerous trend of more violent organisations eating into the bases of the moderate left, predicting a more bloody battle in the future. the bihar police have to prepare themselves in a more systematic and professional way to face the challenge. patna is already surrounded by these outfits. now, the recent activities of the pw in vaishali show that patna is bottled up by these outfits and we will get busy in protecting our very lifeline in the times to come, the report has asserted. the report, prepared by the headquarters in january after interaction with field officials and people, notes: red terror has spread far and wide in bihar. the alarming fact is that 28 of the 37 districts of bihar are facing red terror in varying degrees. in the category a, defined as intensely affected, are seven districts: patna, gaya, aurangabad, jehanabad, arwal, bhabhua and rohtas. the moderately hit districts are bhojpur, muzaffarpur, sitamarhi, sheohar, motihari, darbhanga, saharsa, jamui and banka. the districts where the left extremists are about to raise their banner are nalanda, buxar, bettiah, bagaha (west champaran), siwan, katihar, vaishali, madhepura, begusarai, khagaria and bhagalpur. while red terror is not new to bihar, it has become serious because of its inter-state networking and introduction of more lethal weapons and more violent groups. the caste system has always been the bane of the bihar society. now, the red terror, spiced with caste tensions, sets bihar apart from other naxalite-affected states, the report states. the rise of private armies, on the basis of caste-related emotive issues, has made the task of the bihar police all the more difficult than other police forces in the country. the report also refers to the rise of maoists in nepal on the north and the mcc in jharkhand on the south. the report notes that irrational massacres on a large scale in bihar made by the red and private armies may cripple the police apparatus. according to it, the police in central bihar are emotionally and professionally tensed up all the time. the report has given credit to the police for measuring up to the demands made on it despite resource constraints. no police in india are facing such complex issues, the report claims, adding that the prevailing socio-economic disparities are abetting naxalism, with the police having little control over variables that give birth to naxalism.

8,Calls to get cheaper with VSNL disinvestment,"new delhi: the telecom sector crossed another significant milestone on tuesday with the privatisation of videsh sanchar nigam ltd (vsnl). the tata group of companies has been given a 25 per cent in vsnl which has had a monopoly of international long distance (ild) calls. read this story in... the decision to sell the government stake in vsnl to the tatas was taken by the cabinet committee on disinvestment (ccd) on tuesday and announced by disinvestment minister arun shourie. as a result of the sale, come april, vsnl will face competition from private companies like bharti telesonic and now, which have applied for a licence. for consumers, the two moves (tata's management of vsnl and liberalisation of the isd sector) could translate into a decline in isd tariffs and better services in international telephony, possibly from april itself. only last month, std callers saw peak time tariffs fall by up to 62 per cent. ''yes, telesonic has applied for an ild licence and we will be ready to commence services the minute we get it,'' said bharti enterprises cmd sunil mittal. on tariffs, he said, ''we should see significant reduction in isd tariffs as well because of the entry of private players in the sector.'' in fact, now, a prominent internet service provider, has said that it would slash tariffs to about rs 25 from rs 55 per minute (between delhi and new york). some companies, however, are wary of another round of steep reduction in long distance telephony. ''we have seen last month that incumbents like bsnl can take on the private competition very aggressively. i think in the case of isd tariffs new entrants should move with caution,'' said one industry official. (after telesonic announced std rate cuts for mobile-mobile users from rs 24 per minute to rs 12, bsnl slashed the rates for its customers to rs 9, which telesonic had to match.) kishore chaukar, md tata industries, said that vsnl's ''operational decisions'' like tariff cuts would be taken by the new management team, which should be in place within the next few weeks. the isd market in india is about 7,500 crore, with a lot more calls coming into the country than being made, largely because of high tariffs. said one mobile industry spokesman, ''for now, the isd ratio of incoming and outgoing calls is about 1:5. i expect this to improve to 2:5 by next march, provided private isd companies are operational from april and do reduce tariffs substantially.'' broadly, private telecom companies, particularly mobile operators, have welcomed the tatas winning a stake in vsnl saying that the industry looked forward to a ''congenial working environment'' among operators. mobile phone companies feared reliance as a winner for vsnl stake because they have been fighting against the entry of mobile wireless in local loop (m-wll) services, which is backed by reliance. last month, the company sold 4 per cent stake in reliance communications for $ 200 million to us-based qualcomm, a leader in cdma technology, which is to be used for 3g (third generation) mobile data services. cdma is also being used for m-wll services. related stories:

11,Opposition criticises govt on disinvestment,"new delhi: the opposition on wednesday attacked centre's disinvestment policy, accusing it of making a ""distress sale"" of equity in profit-making public sector companies. both the congress and the left parties flayed the disinvestment decision of the government, saying the government was making a last-minute scramble to reduce fiscal deficit. the left termed as anti-people, the cabinet's decision on tuesday to ""part with bluechip profit-making public sector companies"", and said it made a ""mockery of prime minister's pronouncement that his government does not want to liquidate the public sector."" warning vajpayee government that ""this unrestricted sale of india will not be accepted by the people"" a communist party of india (marxist) statement said that the prices at which the government equity in the ibp and the vsnl had been sold constituted a big bonanza for the private sector. "" the hard-earned assets of the indian people built over half a century are being sold at throwaway prices,"" the statement said. ""clearly, this decision has been taken to bridge the burgeoning fiscal deficit on the eve of the annual general budget. the cpm compared the selling with a farmer selling land to meet his daily expenditure. the congress made a more guarded criticism, saying though it is never opposed to disinvestment, but they are against the disinvestment of profit-making organisations. congress spokesman jaipal reddy said the party is also concerned that the government had different standards for different companies. referring to indian oil corporation being allowed to bid for indo-burma petroleum, reddy said, ""if psus are allowed to participate in bidding for the ibp, then they should have been allowed to bid for the videsh sanchar nigam ltd."" the congress, he said, was ""pleading for a uniform objective approach from the government."" he too said this was a ""deliberate means adopted by the government to reduce fiscal deficit.""
