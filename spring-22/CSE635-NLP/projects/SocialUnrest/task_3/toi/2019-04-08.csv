1,"More Godhra-like incidents possible, warns Togadia","ahmedabad: the vishwa hindu parishad (vhp) international general secretary, dr pravin togadia, on sunday warned that the elements responsible for ""talibanisation of islam"", so far confined to jammu and kashmir, have now spread out and so people should be vigilant against possible repetition of godhra-like incidents anywhere in the country. on his return here after a whirlwind tour of northern states, togadia told tnn that his statement was based on the information he received from various sources during his tour and therefore, the possibility of more such violent manifestation, with the attacks on the parliament, red fort and now godhra railway station, should not be ruled out. while expressing serious concern about increasing tendencies of protecting the interests of muslim vote banks by political parties, togadia termed it as dangerous and advised that the voters should reject such parties and groups in the election. ""it was high time that the government initiated strict action against those propagating and practising ''jehad'' and at the same time, a total ban should be imposed on madrassas where nefarious activities were being taught,"" the vhp leader was of the opinion that gujarat has been selected as a soft target by islamic terrorists, because it is one of the most prosperous states and dominated by peace-loving and devout hindus. besides, the continuous telecast of acts of terrorism by electronic media has further aggravated the situation. it has motivated teenagers to punish such elements. the reaction was more intense in rural areas perhaps because the rural people were more sensitive to what had happened at godhra railway station, he said. referring to the godhra carnage, he said that the bloodshed that followed the incident could have been avoided had the muslims living in godhra town forced the 25 main culprits to surrender before the authorities and their leaders tendered an apology about the gruesome tragedy. ""but unfortunately, nothing happened and there was violent reaction to the attack on sabarmati express, which was a pre-planned conspiracy hatched by islamic terrorists,"" togadia said. he also said that pseudo secularists and others should not be invited as mediators in settling the disputes between the hindus and muslims. instead leaders of the recognised muslim organisations should come forward for fruitful dialogues on important issues confronting the two communities. ""the hindu backlash has not only emerged in gujarat but also in other parts of the country. this is because of wanton killings of over 61,000 security personnel and 7,000 hindus in jammu and kashmir."" the vhp has suspended all its public functions in gujarat. this decision will remain in force till normalcy returned to the state, he added.

3,Officials booked for fleecing farmers,"mansa: while successive crop failures from 1993-1999 had left farmers of the area saddled with massive debts, it was boom time for some officials of the punjab agricultural development bank padb) and some political leaders of the area. a case of forgery and cheating has been registered against dozens of padb and agriculture department officials, and private firms most of them allegedly bogus) of mansa by the vigilance department for fleecing farmers. two independent inquiries in 2000, by deputy registrar (vigilance) and assistant commissioner (grievances), revealed fraudulent disbursement and allotment of loans to farmers. the fir, however, was registered only last month. department officials said that despite a clear-cut case against the accused, progress was slow because the name of an akali minister figured in the scam. according to the fir, the padb advanced rs 6,68,68,000 to farmers as long-term agricultural loans and loans for non-farm activities. the accused bank officials, in connivance with bogus firms and middlemen, encouraged poor farmers to take a loan. as the amount for agricultural loans was to be issued in the name of firms selling farm equipment, a number of bogus firms came into being on paper. they began issuing quotations and bills even though some of them did not have a sales tax and registration number, and the name of the firm proprietor was not revealed. as the firms did not sell any equipment and gave the farmers only a small portion of the loan amount in cash, having taken the lionâ€™s share, according to the fir, in 85 per cent of 558 loan cases there was misutilization of the loan amount. there were instances where in single day 23 loan applications were received, loans sanctioned and cheques issued when middlemen were involved, while in cases where no middleman was involved in loan processing, the applications gathered dust for months together. no arrests have been made as yet as investigations are on, said mansa dsp vigilance gurmel singh.

4,"After quake, riots have Amdavadis on the move","ahmedabad: disasters are tailing prof kanji desai of sahajanand arts and commerce college wherever he goes. it was the earthquake which forced him to move out of his badly damaged ashray flats near vijay char rasta and purchase a row-house in vejalpur. ""i opted for santosh chavni because my family members were scared to live in a flat. and purchasing a row-house in navrangpura was out of the question because of prohibitive costs. moreover, vejalpur was considered a fast developing area,"" he says. barely six months after he moved into his new house, desai is rueing his decision. like him, many others in the city would like to move to their own ghettos of safety rather than be on the frontline of two warring communities. ahmedabad is again on the move, the second time in 15 months. if the first exodus was fuelled by the desire to have a safe roof over one''s head, this time it is for a safe neighbourhood. take the case of farookh dilliwalla, an estate broker who dedicated seven shops in revdi bazaar to martyrs of the kargil conflict. dilliwalla moved to the paldi area some time back. today, like many of his neighbours, dilliwalla won''t mind shifting to juhapura, which houses over three lakh muslims. ""there are a lot of families from muslim colony, navrangpura; paldi and shahibaug who are thinking along these lines,"" says dilliwalla. if these families are still ''thinking'', several staying in vejalpur have already temporarily shifted to ''safer'' areas. ""i think i made a mistake by purchasing a flat in shrinand nagar, which was considered to be a middle-class paradise. for the last so many days, people in that area have not slept peacefully,"" says bimal ghosh, who works for an mnc. ghosh shifted to goyal intercity last week and pays rs 3,500 as rent. ""i will sell my flat and purchase one in this area,"" he says. r narayanan too feels unsafe in kaveri apartments, which is close to the ''border''. however, narayanan does not intend to move out. ""i think with a police station nearby, nothing untoward will happen,"" he says. estate agents also admit that these days a lot of inquiries come from vejalpur. ""we''ve had a lot of queries from vejalpur,"" says d patel of the patel estate agency. such a movement has changed real estate equations in a big way. ""the number of daily inquiries have certainly increased,"" says hanif pradhan of classic constructions in juhapura. for instance, while rates in juhapura have gone up from rs 3,500 to over rs 5,000, it''s exactly the opposite in vejalpur. however pankaj shah of bakeri constructions is optimistic. ""very few families have migrated out of vejalpur. there are over 2,000 families living in shrinand nagar alone. and where will they get a scheme which is this cheap. they will have to pay almost double the price if they want to purchase a flat in navrangpura."" unlike vejalpur, rates may not go down in satellite, but the market will surely stagnate. ""there will be a lull in the market as people will think twice before investing money,"" says dinesh sharma, an estate broker. but as shah points out: ""people''s memory is shortlived. after the quake everyone thought that nobody would dare to live in a high rise building. but that''s not the case now.""

10,Running riot at Wildflower Hall,"new delhi: why should a hotel called wildflower hall make news? one, its delicious name. two, its location on the snowy slopes of himachal pradesh. three, a brazen takeover of the hotel by the government in a season of reforms under arun shourieâ€™s clear blue divestment skies. wildflower hall is ranked as one of the finest getaways in the north. its fancifully priced rooms are meant for holidaymakers with big budgets and small attention spans. their extravagance has been very welcome in a state that depends on tourism for much of its earnings. the hotel has been managed by the oberois and is jointly owned by them and the himachal pradesh government since 1995 when the congress was in power. but on march 6 this year, wildflower hallâ€™s arcadian calm was suddenly disturbed. the bharatiya janta party state government stepped in to do an old-fashioned act of smash and grab. it junked its agreement with the oberois and declared itself in control of the management. all this happened not just in contravention of standard business practices, but in the flash of an eye, without the formality of a notice. a meeting and some exchanges had preceded the showdown, but by all indications the government was spoiling for a fight. officials wonâ€™t speak about the development, but the governmentâ€™s charge are that the oberois have failed to make the hotel fully operational, not met obligatory technical services, changed the equity holding without consulting the government and moved large sums to associate companies. the government has had many demands. it wanted to revalue the land given to the oberois at rs 7.5 crore and change it from freehold to leasehold. the oberois were also told at a meeting to cough up rs 20 crore and buy out the governmentâ€™s stake. the oberois have denied the charges as being baseless. â€˜â€˜we entered into an agreement with the government of himachal pradesh. the fact that it was the congress in power then and itâ€™s the bjp now should not make a difference,â€™â€™ says a company spokesman. the oberois are, however, willing to buy out the governmentâ€™s stake in the joint venture, but they want to know the basis for the rs 20 crore valuation. they have suggested that an independent valuer be appointed. it was after this proposal that the state government chose to do its smash and grab number. it convened a meeting of the board with only its own three nominee directors present and decided to remove the directors and the managing director representing the oberois. it also declared the stake held by the oberois as vesting with the state of himachal pradesh. the matter now rests before the company law board which has suggested that the two sides come to a commercially transparent settlement. but what does all this say for himachal pradesh, a state eager to be called a haven for investors?

12,HIV cases in Bihar far exceed govt figures,"patna: although the official figures say that there are only 1,350 hiv positive cases in bihar, experts feel that it is just the tip of an iceberg since a large number of people suspected to have the infection are still unwilling to undergo pathological tests to ascertain their status mainly due to the social stigma attached to hiv positive and aids patients. national aids control organisation (naco) consultant rajiv sadanandan, who was here to attend the three-day workshop on project implementation programme, said the official figure for hiv positive cases in bihar does not reflect the actual position. â€œit is just the tip of an iceberg. very small number of hiv positive patients know their status,â€� he added. for a period up to six months after the infection the virus is not detectable. the naco consultant said in view of the existence of a large number of infected people, the state is urgently required to take steps to prevent spread of the infection. it would have to concentrate on the risk zones like patna, muzaffarpur and darbhanga where the infection appears to have already reached alarming proportions, he observed. sadanandan, however, said a large number of people are coming to the voluntary counselling and testing centres (vctcs) set up by the bihar state aids control society (bsacs) due to the assurance of confidentiality. attempts to identify hiv positive persons may not be the best strategy as it would have an adverse impact on the prevention efforts. â€œif these persons are followed up by the government machinery, the confidentiality would be lost and such people would be discouraged from coming to the testing centres,â€� he maintained. sadanandan said even if such people are to be identified and prevented from having sex or donating blood, others who are not aware of their status would continue to have unsafe sex and spread infection. the best policy for the state would be to presume that any act of unsafe sex would lead to infection and persuade people to keep away from sex outside marriage or protect themselves by using condoms during the sexual act. the experience has shown that people having tested hiv positive generally follow the advice received at the vctcs on infection control and desist from high-risk behaviour, he added. sadanandan said the naco wants the hiv infected people to form an association of their own to prevent spread of the infection besides taking care of the members. bsacs project director c k anil said on sunday that the society has decided to extend financial help to such bodies. hiv positive people have formed their associations in maharashtra, manipur, nagaland and tamil nadu.

15,PM has endorsed violence in Gujarat: V P Singh,"mumbai: former prime minister v.p. singh on saturday accused prime minister atal behari vajpayee of endorsing the violence in gujarat by not asking narendra modi to resign as gujarat chief minister.

speaking at a public meeting organised by the committee for the protection of democratic rights (cpdr) to condemn the violence in gujarat and the prevention of terrorism act (pota), mr singh stated that there was ``enough evidence'''' to corroborate the fact that mr modi had ``deliberately failed'''' to protect the lives of hundreds of citizens. ``despite that he continues to be the cm. atalji has said that the carnage in gujarat has made his head hang in shame. but where are his hands?'''' he asked in disgust.

addressing the packed hall at the ywca, colaba, he added, ``sacking mr modi would be the first step in regaining the confidence of the terrorised citizens. a government which has failed to bring the culprits to book has no right to stay in power''''.

calling mr vajpayee `a rashtriya swayam sevak (rss) pracharak'', mr singh said it is now up to the people to deprive fundamentalist forces from taking control of the state machinery to propagate hatred. ``we have to fight the psyche of hatred. people can survive poverty but not mindless hatred,'''' he said.

rajya sabha mp shabana azmi said that by letting the murderers in gujarat go unpunished, the government was sending out a very dangerous message__``if you kill one person you will be punished but if you indulge in mass murder, amnesty will be provided''''. she urged the cpdr to file a public interest litigation against mr modi for abdicating his duty.

taking the argument further, theatre and film personality farooque sheikh said the barbaric acts in gujarat reflect the dehumanisation of society. ``we can only pray for the people to maintain the basic tenets of a civil society where differences are not only accepted but also respected,'''' he said.

film-maker mahesh bhatt expressed concern at the trend of the police force becoming a tool in the hands of politicians. ``the national human rights commission report on gujarat has clearly stated that this trend if left unchecked can become very dangerous,'''' he said.

several prominent citizens such as dr h.g. desai and communication specialist alyque padamsee appealed to the public to help in providing immediate relief to victims.

linking the violence in gujarat to a social conditioning by fundamentalist forces, cpdr secretary p.a. sebastian said that laws like pota alone are not sufficient to curb terrorism. he said that by passing such laws, the government was simply arming itself to overrule people''s democratic rights. ``pota not only criminalises dissent but also cultivates totalitarianism,'''' he said.

ms azmi along with mr singh felt that the government could easily misuse pota ``just as it had disregarded people''s rights under pota''s predecessor terrorist and disruptive activities (prevention) act (tada)''''.

``of the total 77,000 arrested up under tada, as many as 72,000 were let off, as the government had no case against them. the conviction rate under tada was a mere 1.78 per cent'''' said ms azmi. ``with a history like that can we expect a just application of pota, which gives the state more power against an individual?,'''' she asked.

16,Sinha for better laws to squeeze terror funds,"new delhi: law minister arun jaitley and finance minister yashwant sinha on sunday called for stringent laws and specialised tribunals to check economic offences. they said legal instruments should be designed to confiscate illegally occupied properties and assets of criminals. both were speaking at a seminar on combating terrorism and other crimes through forfeiture of property. â€˜â€˜no man should be allowed to keep the proceeds of crime,â€™â€™ said law minister arun jaitley while finance minister yashwant sinha called for a review of laws on secrecy of banking operations. sinha blamed banking secrecy laws of the developed nations for hindering the operations against terrorism through their funding. citing a 1944 war-time ordinance that provided for the forfeiture of property of civil servants indulging in corruption, jaitley said such legal measures were needed while fighting terrorism. advocating stringent laws and specialised tribunals to curb economic offences, sinha said while indian laws allowed investigation of bank accounts to trace terroristsâ€™ funding, the secrecy laws of developed nations was an obstacle. stressing the link between narco- trade and terrorism, sinha said laws on forfeiture and narcotics required to be formulated so that they prevented funding of terrorism. he said stringent laws were needed to fight economic crimes as there was a widespread feeling one could get away with such offences because of the tardy judicial provisions related to this. he said specialised tribunals would ensure quicker convictions. the finance ministry is yet to take up the issue with the law ministry. jaitley listed poverty and terrorism as two major problems facing the world today, and said terrorism had acquired â€˜â€˜alarming proportionsâ€™â€™ during the past decade. justice b n kirpal of the supreme court said the country needed capable officers to ensure that no innocent person was punished while enforcing special laws.

26,Proposal to merge agricultural societies,"kakinada: cooperation minister ch ramachandra rao said a proposal for the merger of primary agricultural societies and reducing their number was under the active consideration of a cabinet sub-committee constituted for the purpose. the minister said that there were about 4,610 primary agricultural societies in the state. considering parameters like performance, losses, and their capability to extend loans to the farmers, the smaller societies which could not sustain themselves would be merged. similarly, those having no hope of recovering from their present losses would also be merged, thus reducing the number of societies. ramachandra rao said that the merger would help the societies generate profits once again by consolidating them on a strong footing and providing financial viability to play a key role in helping farmers. the minister said that at present, the outstanding dues of the societies stood at rs 460 crore. in view of this, the government has proposed a one-time settlement in which rs 162 crore accruing in the form of interest would be waived, resulting in net dues of about rs 300 crore from the farmers. he said that those who had availed of loans before 1995 could use the opportunity of the one-time settlement scheme to clear their dues before june 30. those who were not in a position to clear their entire dues could pay 25 per cent and join in the scheme. the balance amount could be paid in one year, he added. rao said that several positive steps were taken in the interest of the societies like reduction of interest rates from 15 to 12 per cent and cancellation of collection charges.
