1,Civic bodies get a new development mantra,"HYDERABAD: ''Build, Demolish and Build (BDB)'' appears to be the new ''city development strategy'' of civic bodies such as the Municipal Corporation of Hyderabad (MCH), Hyderabad Urban Development Authority (Huda) and the Roads and Buildings (R&B) department, especially around the Hussain Sagar.

These government agencies increasingly take up beautification projects around the Hussain Sagar without proper planning, then change plans and demolish what has been developed, and take up another beautification project.

An example is the View Park initially developed by the MCH after spending lakhs of rupees. Once the View Park was completed, the chief minister handed it over to the Huda. The Huda then demolished the View Park developed by the MCH and spend lakhs of rupees constructing the park once again. The policy of BDB has proved to be beneficial only to the contractors who are bagging contracts regularly, thanks to the improper planning and wasteful expenditure of civic bodies, a senior government official said.

Similarly, the R&B department constructed a railing along Hussain Sagar on Tank Bund at a cost of Rs 25 lakh. When it attracted lot of criticism from the public as it came in the way of people crossing from one side of the road to the other, the R&B immediately removed the railing.

The MCH has now taken the BDB policy a step further by constructing a railing on the other side of the Tank Bund to prevent people from entering the lawns lined with statues. The MCH is spending Rs 50 lakh for the purpose, the official said.

Not to be left behind, the HUDA has taken up landscaping and beautification works in Lumbini Park at a cost of Rs 2 crore following the BDB policy, in spite of the park being one of the best in the twin cities. Moreover, continuous unplanned construction has left building material on Tank Bund for the past six months and this material is also posing danger to the motorists.

2,Trinamul dithers on rally ban order,"KOLKATA: The Trinamul Congress seems to be in two minds on how to react to the Calcutta High Court order banning rallies in Kolkata between 8 am and 8 pm on weekdays.

While the party has already expressed reservations about the order, Leader of the Opposition Pankaj Banerjee qualified the reservations on Thursday.

Trinamul MLA Paras Datta released copies of a letter he had sent to the Chief Justice of India, requesting the Supreme Court''s intervention in the recent controversy.

Datta alleged that the West Bengal government had remained passive to the high court order and allowed the CPM to violate it blatantly.

Besides, the ruling party had launched a tirade against Justice Amitava Lala who had passed the order.

He prayed to the apex court to order a CBI investigation into the allegation that the state government was abetting subversion of the judiciary.

This would attract Central intervention under Article 356 of the Constitution, he said.

Having opposed the high court order, the Trinamul was apparently finding it difficult to demand imposition of Article 356 over this issue, though the party had been crying hoarse about Central intervention in the state on the ground of breakdown of law and order.

""Datta must have sent it in his individual capacity. I will talk to him on this,"" Banerjee said.

But the state government should not abet subversion of the judiciary and CPM leaders should not be allowed to launch personal attacks against judges, he added.

""We have reservations about the court verdict,"" Banerjee clarified, ""but if the state government wants to oppose it, it should move legally and apply before a higher bench of the court against the order.""

Before Datta''s mention of Article 356, state BJP general secretary Rahul Sinha raised the demand at a public meeting on Wednesday evening.

When asked about it, Banerjee, too, said there was a case for Central intervention as there was a ""constitutional deadlock"", with the ruling party opposing a court order.

The police would be at a loss how to deal with the situation on October 13, when a number of CPM-backed organisations would take out a rally in protest against the court order, he pointed out.

5,I'll never join politics in my life: Lyngdoh,"PATNA: Lamenting that politics in India was getting sick day by day due to the entry of criminal elements in the fray among others, Chief Election Commissioner of India J M Lyngdoh on Thursday said he would never join politics in his life.

Addressing a function organised by Humlog, a citizens forum here, Lyngdoh listed three factors â€” entry of a large number of criminal elements in the fray, growing incidents of defection in the parties and unchecked use of huge sums of money by candidates and parties to win the polls â€” because of which politics was getting sick everyday.

Lyngdoh pleaded for powers to the Election Commission (EC) under the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) to enable it to take anticipatory measures to prevent electoral malpractices. He said it should also get powers to tackle unforseen developments during elections.

6,'Gujarat riot was embarrassing',"NEW DELHI: Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani has acknowledged that the Supreme Courtâ€™s observations on the handling of the riot cases by the Gujarat government were â€˜â€˜embarrassingâ€™â€™ for the government.

However, he said that these should be seen in the light of the wider criminal justice system. â€˜â€˜In fact I have seen cases which collapsed totally simply because the system is such,â€™â€™ he told Karan Thapar in an interview for his programme â€˜â€˜Hardtalkâ€™â€™ on BBC World. In the interview, to be telecast on Friday, Advani said the court was disturbed because of the incidents.

â€˜â€˜What happened in Gujarat could disturb anyone. Moreover, when one finds that the offenders are not brought to the book, it gives way to a strong reaction. At the same time, I am not able to attribute it only to one case. I have seen so many cases,â€™â€™ he said. He refused to compare the Gujarat incidents with similar incidents earlier and their prosecution and said he would again emphasise that it was a failure of the system.

â€˜â€˜I certainly do not accept that it is a deliberate subversion of justice by the state government.... A large section of the people think that what happened is wrong and should not have happened, but at the same time, the government or the ruling party cannot be blamed.â€™â€™ He rejected the allegation that the BJP-ruled Gujarat government was acting in collusion with the riot accused and shielding them.

7,"Khadi will be promoted, says minister","PATNA: Union small industries minister C P Thakur said here on Thursday that the State Bank of India has agreed to give loans to small industries on prime lending rate (PLR).

He said that small industries would not find any problem in getting loans from the banks. The banks need to do their business by disbursing loans, otherwise, they would collapse, he said and urged banks not to ignore the growth of small industries for which the Union government has launched the credit guarantee schemes.

He said industries, including â€œseepâ€� button industry, bamboo-based industry, makhana-based industry and fish product industry, are being promoted in the state.

Junior Union minister for food and rural industries Sanghapriya Gautam said that his ministry is taking initiatives to boost the khadi industry. He said that the need is to provide raw materials to the artisans. The khadi industry provides great employment opportunities, he added.

He said that his ministry has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the IIT, Delhi, for creation of sophisticated machines to make fine khadi clothes.

MoU has also been signed with the National Institute of Design, Ahmedabad, for designing khadi clothes. Creation of khadi jeans is the latest trend which is likely to sweep the market, he said.

8,CEC: Amend defection law,"PATNA: Chief Election Commissioner J M Lyngdoh on Thursday pleaded for powers to the Election Commission under the criminal procedure code to enable it to take anticipatory measures to prevent electoral malpractices and tackle unforseen developments during elections.

Requesting the Centre to make appropriate amendment to the Constitution to vest powers under the CrPC to the EC, Lyngdoh said that at present it operated under the Representation of People''s Act and IPC only.

The CEC also favoured amendment in the Constitution to check defection. The members of Parliament and state legislatures defecting to another party should be made to re-contest their seats, he said.

Defection was nothing short of betrayal of voters who had voted for them, Lyngdoh said. Moreover, the President, and not the Speaker or chairman of the House concerned, should be the final authority to take a decision on the issue of defection or split in parties. The President should take the decision in consultation with the EC, he suggested.

He also said that retired bureaucrats and police officers should not join politics for five years after their retirement.

Replying to a query, the CEC made it clear that with the EC enforcing the model code of conduct in Patna, Gaya and Sitamarhi districts, where bypolls to one assembly seat each was due on November 20, vice-president Bhairon Singh Shekhawat could not lay the foundation stone for the 500-bed AIIMS-type hospital in Patna on October 11. The EC had already written to both the Centre and the state government in this regard.

Though he claimed that even under the present laws the EC could hold free, fair and impartial polls, Lyngdoh said that electoral malpractices could not be stopped completely under the present system.

He said that the EC would use electronic voting machines across the country during the next Lok Sabha polls. However, this would not stop rigging and bogus voting completely. ""You know, men are like monekys. They can always have some new tricks up their sleeves,"" he jokingly remarked.

The CEC said the next Lok Sabha polls would be held in September next year, barring any unforeseen circumstances.

9,DGP writes to govt for talks with Naxalites,"PATNA: Director general of police (DGP) D P Ojha has urged the state government to initiate dialogue with the top leaders of the ultra left outfits to contain the extremist-related violence in the state.

""Dialogue would be beneficial in order to understand their specific problems. On the basis of the dialogue, the government would be able to arrive at some conclusions in order to solve their problems at the grassroot level,"" Ojha said in a letter to the government on Thursday.

The letter also said that problems related to unemployement, land reforms and economic development can be sorted at the government-level talks with these ultra left leaders. Since these problems are not merely a law and order problem it should be looked into in a broader perspective in order to understand their problems.

Copies of the letter have been forwarded to the chief secretary, home commissioner and other senior government functionaries for necessary action. Besides this, the DGP has also directed field officials to upgrade their skills in tackling VIP security.

DGP had convened a meeting on Wednesday to discuss the ways and means to augment the present security cover for VIPs in the state in the light of recent threat of the PW. Lately, the police have become a soft target for ultras.

As many as 23 police personnel were killed by Naxalites last year. Only recently, the Centre has expressed its inability to provide additional five battalions of central para military force jawans to tackle extremism in Bihar in view of the forthcoming elections in five states. It has further said that the required quantity of sophisticated arms cannot be provided because of inadequate supply of arms from ordnance factories.

Meanwhile, the government''s much-publicised surrender policy has failed to take off in extremist-hit districts of Bihar. Only last year, the government had announced a special package for the surrendered Naxalites. According to official sources, as many as 240 hardcore Naxalites have surrendered in the state so far.

A large number of ""surrendered"" Naxalites have not received their rehabilitation package amount. However, a senior police official said a sum of Rs 4 crore has been allocated exclusively for this purpose and added it would soon be distributed.

In recent months, the PW and MCC have launched a joint action programme in different parts of Bihar and Jharkhand.

10,City police put to rally test again,"KOLKATA: Friday will be an acid test for the city police. Although the ruling Left Front adopting took the middle path in its first public programme on the Calcutta High Court ruling on rallies, the Naxalites are apparently heading for a showdown.

The CPI(ML) Liberation is all set to defy the ruling on Friday afternoon by taking out a procession from Raja Subodh Mullick Square to Rani Rashmoni Avenue.

The police are keeping their cards close to their chest. ""We have not yet received the certified copy of the high court order and it is not possible to comment on anything now,"" said DC (headquarters) Kuldeip Singh.

Sources, however, claimed that arrangements were ready to thwart the rally before it hits the busy central Kolkata roads.

Commissioner of police Sujoy Chakraborti said after receiving the order, the police would consult legal experts to arrive at a decision.

But the Naxalites are firm on their stand. CPI(ML) Liberation state secretary Kartik Pal said party supporters would get arrested if necessary to protest such an order.

""The CPM may like to avoid confrontation, but we cannot allow infringement of our democratic right. We will defy the order, let the police do whatever they want,"" he said. The party had not even informed the police on the proposed rally.

The SUCI would however restrict itself to holding a convention at the University Institute Hall at College Square on Friday.

Its state secretary Pravas Ghosh said the party would try to mobilise public opinion against the high court judgement.

12,Chauhan files plea for SGPC general elections,"CHANDIGARH: Khalistan protagonist Dr Jagjit Singh Chauhan has filed a petition by way of public interest litigation (PIL) in the Punjab and Haryana High Court seeking directions to the Union government to hold general elections to the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) without further loss of time.

In his petition, Chauhan has pointed out that the under Section 51 of the Sikh Gurdwara Act, 1925, the term and membership of the general house of the SGPC is for five years.

The last such elections were held in 1996 and as such the present house tenure ended in the year 2001. Unfortunately, the history of the SGPC shows that the general elections were never held in time.

To substantiate his point, Chauhan submitted that after the elections held in 1979, the next such elections were held only in 1996 after a gap of 17 years instead of five years and the same have not been held since then.

The elections to the SGPC which is an inter-state body of Sikh religious shrines in Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and the Union Territory of Chandigarh are conducted by the Union government with the assistance of concerned state governments.

Chauhan asserted that the elections to the general house of SGPC had been delayed due to political convenience and for no other reason.

The spirit of the Sikh Gurdwara Act and its Section 51 of the Act were very clear in this respect and the members of the present house were enjoying patronage and privileges much beyond the stipulated tenure, Chauhan observed.

He stated that the basic principle of democracy was that the will of the people must prevail but the same was being denied in the present case illegally. The PIL, which comes as a follow up of the petitioner''s legal notice to the Union government and the Punjab government about a month ago, is likely to be taken up sometime in the next week.

13,Bengal venture fund seeks govt help,"KOLKATA: The state-promoted venture fund in West Bengal has sent a SOS to the local Left Front government to immediately release Rs 2 crore to increase its available corpus.

Sources said the request was made to the West Bengal government before the Pujas with venture fund authorities outlining the urgency of the monetary requirement in order to fund more companies.

The WB Asset Management.com Ltd â€” formed in mid-2000 â€” has funded only six companies so far mainly because of resource constraints, even as it continues to be flooded with requests for funding.

""Given the fact that the state is trying to emerge as an IT powerhouse, it is extremely important that the size of the corpus is increased soon as the fund will start losing its importance if it has to turn away entrepreneurs for lack of money,"" the sources said.

""We are hoping the government contribution will come through at the earliest,"" they added.

It is unclear, however, how much the state government would be able to contribute to augment the fundâ€™s coffers given its own precarious financial position.

The fund â€” co-promoted by Webel, WBIDC and Sidbi â€” is slated to have a corpus of Rs 15 crore, with each of the promoters supposed to be chipping in with Rs 5 crore each.

However, the fundâ€™s available corpus â€” including the money already given out to firms â€” currently stands at a mere Rs 1.5 crore.

The sources said they were confident that it would not be a problem to get Sidbi to release more money. ""Sidbi has always been very supportive of our endeavour and getting them to sanction additional funds should not pose any great difficulty, once we get the money from the government,"" they said. Sidbi has so far released Rs 50 lakh to the fund.

Incidentally, the venture fund in West Bengal is not yet a member of the Indian Venture Capital Association (IVCA) which acts as the forum of venture capitalists in the country, thereby raising the possibility of losing out on potential networking opportunities.
