1,Protests against helmet rule held in Kolhapur,"kolhapur: the compulsory wearing of helmets by twowheeler riders, to be implemented in kolhapur from march 2, 2002, is being opposed by citizens. a group of around 300 protestors led by kolhapur district central co-operative bank director bunty patil recently took a morcha from dassera chowk to the district collectorate to protest against the helmet rule. a fortnight ago, kolhapur city nationalist congress party president and former mayor r.k. powar had also submitted a memorandum to the collector rajgopal deora against the state government directive in this regard. mr powar has said that the helmet rule was a marketing gimmick to improve the sales of companies manufacturing helmets. use of helmets should be a personal choice, not a compulsion, he added. the former mayor said the kmc should instead improve the ill-maintained roads of the city. according to a recent survey conducted by the rto,kolhapur region has 2,37,650 two-wheelers. sangli and satara have 1,51,347 and 1,35,787 two-wheelers respectively. the total number of two-wheelers in the district till october 31 was 5,24,815. regional transport officer (kolhapur region) arun n. bhalchandra, told the times of india that his department would strictly implement the rule as it was in the public interest. meanwhile, to monitor traffic rules, the kolhapur district police have appointed around 52 traffic policemen in kolhapur and another 15 in ichalkaranji.

2,"MPs, officials clash, hinder security","new delhi: though terrorists who attacked the parliament house were stopped before they could enter the building itself, security officials are appalled at their ability to penetrate the outer perimeter of the building. security officials say that while access to the parliament house is very strict, mps refuse to cooperate with the security regime. ''our biggest problem is the honourable members themselves,'' says a senior intelligence official. ''they do not want their cars to be checked at the gate and want to be dropped at the very entrance of parliament house,'' he adds. the result is that any car with a red flasher and appearing to have a pass can barge through the main gates to parliament house. then there is the matter of the mps' car stickers. ''some mps demand six or seven stickers, even if they don't possess cars,'' says a senior minister, ''they parcel these out to close supporters in the constituency.'' others, including journalists, who are given such stickers have to submit registration papers of their vehicles before they are provided with a single sticker. some time back the speaker was compelled to install special jammers to prevent cellphones being used inside the house. such phones are a security hazard since they can be use to detonate hidden explosives. security specialists have been warning the political and security establishment that the growing incidence of attacks requires strict access control measures in sensitive areas, ''but even now ministers and officials want to be driven to the doorstep of their offices.'' besides mps, the big culprits in new delhi appear to be the ministries of home and finance. ''external affairs minister jaswant singh deserves praise for blocking access to the mea's main gate by vehicles. he did this by setting an example by walking the last 50 metres to work,'' says the official.

3,Coffin scam a boon for Rabri govt,"patna: like the tehelka expose, the revelation regarding what is now popularly referred to as the ""coffin scam"" could not have come at a better time for the ruling rjd. when tehelka revealed corruption in the defence ministry, the rabri government was facing destabilisation move spearheaded by ranjan prasad yadav (rajya sabha mp), who threatened to take away rjd mlas. the coffin scam comes at a time when rjd chief laloo prasad yadav is undergoing judicial custody in connection with the multi-crore fodder scam. ""it further weakens our moral ground against laloo,"" said a samata party mla. naturally, the rjd has been quick to give the war-cry. it has not only demanded dismissal of defence minister george fernandes and the vajpayee government, but also said a treason case be registered against fernandes. ""there is nothing more disgusting than trying to make money on soldiers who laid down their lives for the country in the kargil conflict,"" said laloo while speaking to journalists in ranchi, when being shifted to patna by plane to appear in the cbi designated court in connection with the disproportionate assets (da) case on thursday. laloo made his point. ""is it not an irony that the man who uncovered a scam (read fodder scam) is behind bars on concocted charges, while tainted nda ministers are moving around scot free,"" he said.

4,"I had warned government, says Mamata","kolkata: former railway minister mamata banerjee claimed on thursday that barely 10 days ago she had warned the union home ministry that the parliament house was vulnerable to terrorist attacks. banerjee refused to say if she had any prior information about the possibility of an attack. ""i had a premonition,"" she said in kolkata. ""i had dictated a note to an officer of the union home ministry, drawing attention to parliament house's vulnerability in the face of a terrorist attack. in the note, i had also mentioned the use of a car bomb in case such an attack was planned,"" banerjee told reporters. she said that the delhi incident has shaken the foundation of indian democracy and the time had come for a rethink on a number of issues concerning security in vital installations. pointing out that the terrorists' had come in a car fitted with a red light, banerjee said that it has become clear that a mere sporting of a red light did not mean that the car belonged to a vip. similarly, it was quite apparent that the miscreants had fudged official stickers and other passes which confused securitymen on duty. moreover, securitymen should also be careful of those masquereding in police uniforms, banerjee pointed out, adding that even press stickers were being used liberally by everyone. ""even ambulances need to be checked thoroughly. we have information that ambulances are being used to ferry arms and ammunition. ""misuse of these must be dealt more firmly by the government,"" mamata banerjee said. she also felt that security bandobast should be strengthened in the area the area surrounding parliament house. ""even around mps quarters, there is at present only one security guard. the government should look into these matters,"" banerjee said.

5,Attack opens terror law box,"kolkata: the daring terrorist attack on parliament on thursday morning has reopened the debate over the need for an anti-terrorist ordinance like poto. while the left parties fervently argued that the attack, in no way, justified poto, the bjp expected the opponents of the ordinance to rethink their stand after the strike at the heart of indian democracy. going even a step further, the trinamul congress felt that the country should reach a consensus over a single law against terrorism. ""poto is already in force. why did then the government fail to prevent the terrorist attack?"" said cpm state secretary anil biswas while explaining that the party would not budge an inch from its opposition to poto. ""today's incident proves that poto will not be able to prevent terrorism,"" added politburo member biman bose. strongly opposing ""any attempt to justify poto after today's incident,"" forward bloc general secretary debabrata biswas said that the existing laws were fully capable of combating terrorist acts. ""it is an intelligence and security failure on the part of the government,"" biswas said. the forward bloc leader also felt that terrorism had been on the rise ever since the bjp came to power at the centre. bjp state president asim ghosh, however, minced no words in defence of poto. ""i hope, after thursday, those opposing poto will reconsider their stand,"" ghosh told tnn. his ally in nda, trinamul congress, was however, more guarded on its reaction. advocating the line that the debate over poto and poca must not be confused with thursday's attack, trinamul chairperson mamata banerjee favoured a single comprehensive law to deal with terrorism. ""there should be one law to deal with terrorism and parties should be unanimous in enacting the legislation,"" banerjee said. explaining her party's stand, banerjee said that while trinamul was opposed to any kind of compromise with terrorism, misuse of the legislation was also something trinamul was opposed to. ""three of our amendments on poto have already been considered,"" banerjee said. surprisingly, congress position on thursday's incident and the need for poto was somewhat similar to that of trinamul. pradesh congress leaders also felt that the two issues must not be mixed. ""didn't the congress fight terrorism without poto,"" asked pradesh congress vice-president pradip bhattacharya. on the other hand, rebel trinamul leader ajit panja admitted that poto may be inevitable even though it would curb the citizen's rights. ""given the difficult times, we may have to accept it,"" panja said.

7,Attack may help govt's terror law cause,"new delhi: as a shaken government tried to come to terms with the impact of the terrorist assault, it also began to examine whether the attack did not also open a window of opportunity for it to blunt the opposition's campaign against poto. but the official line taken by the government on thursday was that, for the moment, the focus should be on the horror of the incident. the object was clearly to try and repeat the kargil formula - one, that an efficient and beefed-up security system saved parliament house and our lawmakers; two, that this is not the time to carp about intelligence failures or security lapses but unitedly to back the government's efforts to battle terrorism. and lead from that to mobilising public support for poto. this was the message that emanated from the resolution passed by the union cabinet which held an emergency meeting immediately after the cabinet committee on security took stock of the situation. ""the nation accepts the challenge. the first requisite is that each of us be vigilant, and that all of us remain united. the assault is yet another reminder that each of us must measure the issues we take up against the challenge that confronts the country."" this was also the underlying theme of home minister advani's press briefing on the two cabinet meetings. later, asked whether the attack would help the government in passing poto, advani said, ""as far as the government is concerned, we were of the opinion that there was need for such a law even before this incident."" bjp president k jana krishnamurthy said, ""the bjp firmly belives that thursday's experience will bring to a close the politico-intellectual approach to the nation's security matters and all sections of society and shades of opinion will rally together to accept the challenge thrown by terrorists."" indeed, the government's strategy appears to be: one, on friday, the lok sabha speaker and the rajya sabha chairperson will move resolutions on the incident in their respective houses to put an official parliamentary condemnation of the attack and a tribute to the security personnel who were killed or injured on record, speeches by mps on the subject, and then adjourn parliament for the day. two, assess over the weekend and monday - which is a holiday for eid - the opposition's position on poto. after that, the government will have just four days of the present session to try and pass poto in both houses. if it looks as though the opposition remains adamant, then the government is still keeping open the option of re-promulgating the ordinance. but one way or the other, the bjp is confident. the coffin issue has been buried by thursday's incident, and the campaign against poto has been somewhat weakened.

""the urban voters will be brought on the website first followed by rural voters in the entire country."" the computer-based system would put a stop to enrolment of bogus voters. the system would cover all the 650 million voters in the country, he said. lyngdoh, during a meeting with deputy commissioners to discuss the pre-poll situation in the state at amritsar on thursday, had expressed serious concern over the alleged deletion of names from the voters list. he directed the officials to look into the complaints received from muktsar and naushera panuan areas.

9,BSNL to negotiate prices for equipment,"new delhi: in the wake of communication minister pramod mahajan's concern over high cost of equipment to be procured for cellular services, bharat sanchar nigam is understood to have decided to negotiate afresh terms with suppliers despite having issued advance purchase order. the delay in procuring equipment, at an estimated cost of about rs 2,600 crore, could lead to losses of about rs 100 crore a month besides a piquant situation of renegotiations after giving advance purchase order to lowest tender bidders for different zones. full board meeting with the two government nominees would be convened soon by bsnl to iron out reported differences on placement of orders, sources said. bsnl chief executive d p s seth and other officials were unwilling to talk on the issue despite repeated contacts. the controversy over the tender for supply of cellular equipment for bsnl had arisen after mahajan recently indicated to go for rebidding saying the cost was much higher than what was initially provisioned by bsnl prior to inviting bids. sources in the corporation, however, emphasised that estimates of rs 2,000 crore given by bsnl was ""for the purpose of budget provisioning"" and accordingly could not be construed as a firm indicator of bids and estimates. moreover, the total cost of the four zones together sums up to approximately rs 2,550 crore of which negotiations over the cost of equipment for the east zone are yet to be carriedout, they said adding that after negotiations for east zone the cost was likely to come down further.

10,BJP ministers to mobilise support for terror law,"new delhi: the passage of poto, whether in the normal way, through a joint session of parliament or by repromulgating the ordinance, is the top priority of the government-or as some bjp sources stressed, after thursday's terrorist strike on parliament house, a prestige issue now. to this end, some of the bjp's cabinet ministers — including murli manohar joshi, sushma swaraj, venkaiah naidu, arun shourie and arun jaitley and minister of state ravi shankar prasad — are fanning out this weekend all over the country to draw attention to the dangers of terrorism and mobilise support for poto. this decision was taken after some of them met the prime minister and home minister to discuss the possible political fallout of thursday's terrorist attack on parliament house. earlier in the day, bjp mps met the pm to urge him to take the strongest possible action against terrorism, even if that meant ''hot pursuit'' and crossing the loc to smash terrorist camps in pok. the pm, reportedly, heard them out, but did not respond. but the request of the mps appeared to be in line with the resolution adopted by the union cabinet on thursday: ''we will liquidate the terrorists and their sponsors wherever they are, whoever they are.'' the aim of the ministers's speeches around the country will be frontally to criticise the opposition, particularly the congress, for describing what happened on thursday as ''a monumental security lapse'' and trying to score political points against the government instead of highlighting the bravery and sacrifice of the security personnel who laid down their lives. they will point out that in the us, where hundreds died in the september 11 terrorist attack, the entire nation stood like a rock behind president george bush. from that, the ministers will make a case for the passage of poto, or even more stringent government measures to deal with the dangers of terrorism. thereafter, on december 18, when the parliament meets after a long weekend (monday is a holiday for id), advani is scheduled to make a suo moto statement on thursday's incident and then assess the mood of the opposition. as a senior bjp leader put it, ''the entire nation will watch whether they will allow parliament to function.'' then the government will see whether they can introduce and pass poto on december 18, so that they can bring it to the rajya sabha the next day, so that if it fails in that house, they can — by giving the mandatory 24 hours notice — have a joint session on december 21, the last day of the current session, or have it on december 22. however, if the opposition stalls the parliament, then the government will re-promulgate the ordinance.

11,Cong to gauge public mood before deciding on terror law,"new delhi: although the congress maintains it will not dilute its opposition to the prevention of terrorism ordinance (poto) and the coffin scam, it plans to use the coming three-day break to guage the public response to the changed secnario after thursday's strike on parliament and then reformulate its strategy on sustaining its campaign against the nda. there is a feeling in the party that its high-voltage campaign on the coffin scam and its demand for the resignation of george fernadnes had not only put the nda in a spot but had also made a powerful impact on the public. while the combined opposition was gearing up to further corner the government, the thursday attack has completely altered the political agenda. the coffin scam had just about edged poto to the background but the militant strike has brought it back to the political centrestage. while the nda is using this incident to highlight the need for an anti-terror law, the congress has decided to assess the public perception to formulate its stand. party sources say it will depend on the feedback from the public. the congress view is that the thursday strike followed from a massive intelligence failure and security lapse and that the government had failed to safeguard parliament's security. it will seek to stress the point that poto is already in force but had failed to avert the militant attack, despite prior intelligence about it. party sources said the congress working committee resolution thursday evening had consciously highlighted the government's incompetence although it realised this could invite the charge of being ''anti-national'' for not supporting the government in this hour of crisis. the party leaders felt the government should not be allowed to take advantage from this episode as it did in the kargil war. persisting with this line, congress spokesperson s jaipal reddy disagreed with the bjp's comparison of the thursday attack with the september 11 us strikes. the two incidents, he said, are not comparable. the us strikes were absolutely unconventional but parliament strike was crude and conventional about which the government had prior intelligence. preventive measures could have been taken. on hot pursuit of terrorists, reddy said it was for the government to decide whether it should attack across the line of control.

12,Centre moves SC on pleas against terror law,"new delhi: the union government on friday petitioned the supreme court seeking its indulgence on two petitions before the andhra pradesh and kerala high courts challenging the constitutional validity of the prevention of terrorism ordinance (poto). the centre's petition filed by counsel p parmeswaran said poto was promulgated by the president in exercise of his powers under the constitution to deal with terrorist activities. the centre said that a writ petition was filed against the ordinance in ap high court by a cpm leader and another was moved by another petitioner in kerala high court on which notices were issued to the centre. parmeswaran said since both the petitions raised a common question of law relating to the constitutional validity of poto and since the matter ''is sensitive and relates to national security'', it was in the interest of justice that the cases were transferred to the sc.

19,VMC asks Central govt agencies to pay up civic amenities dues,"vadodara: plagued by cash crunch, the vadodara municipal corporation has finally cracked down on various central government agencies, including the army, air force and the airports authority of india for evading municipal taxes to the tune of rs 2.24 crore against water supply of the corporation. the corporation is even contemplating attaching the property of the bigger evaders for recovery of dues. the biggest on the defaulter's list is the airports authority of india which according to the vmc have not paid up since the last three years. the aai's outstanding amount stands at rs 1.03 crore, for which a ""supply discontinuing"" order has already been prepared. the others major defaulter is railways which has more than rs 77 lakh as outstanding against the water used by the department. the air force and the army are the two other defaulters which are to pay the department rs 16 lakh and rs 23.43, while the heavy waters plant owes the corporation about rs lakh. in wake of the octroi evaluation, which is hinting at a very low collection as against an estimate of rs 130 crore, the corporations is going all out to mop up anything due towards payment. according to the deputy mayor, the shifting of the big companies out of the octroi limits and the closure of many production units coupled with a lacklustre market have now started showing its effect on the toll collection. also, the returns on other receipts which is estimated to be another rs 130 crore, the actual collection may only be 70 per cent. ""normally, there are a large number of defaulters which eventually cause the shortfall in the collections,"" said vmc standing committee chairman bharat shah. talking on defaults, deputy mayor shailesh mehta said, ""they are like any other defaulters, and ideally their connections should be snapped at the first instance."" sources in the vmc, however, said despite the fact that the adverse order has been signed against the aai, disconnection of the water supply and the drainage has been deferred temporarily. the municipal commissioner has called the representatives of all defaulting departments for a final discussion on the issue before taking ""action"", informed sources in the corporation said. according to mehta, ""it's good if they react positively, assuring us payment soon. else, we would have to take action apart from disconnecting all civic amenities."" mehta said there are provisions to recover dues of defaulters through auction of property. in view of the financial crunch, vmc functionaries have voluntarily surrendered certain facilities they are entitled to. while most of them, including mayor bharti vyas, have surrendered their mobile phones, many have also decided to bear their fuel cost themselves.

21,'State govt should call a meeting to solve eco crisis in textile industry',"ahmedabad: the acting president of textile labour association, amthabhai desai has expressed serious concern over the economic crisis triggered off by the afghan war, and has suggested the state government to convene a meeting between the employers and the trade union leaders to work out some plans to tide over the situation. in a statement, desai said that the ongoing war between afghanistan and america has dealt a crippling blow on the indian economy, and the state which was already facing a textile crisis would be the worst hit by this recession. he expressed fear that if remedial measures were not taken, at least 2,00,000 labourers would be rendered jobless, while the crisis would affect the turnover of trade and business totalling to rs.30,000 crore. the tla leader has demanded that both the state as well the centre should announce some package of tax concessions for industries so that they could withstand the crisis. desai said that the textile crisis has already caused heavy damage to ancillary industries and even now powerloom and processing units were in great difficulty due to excessive tax structure. more than 60,000 workers of the closed textile mills have not been paid their terminal benefits, and therefore some concrete measures should be taken to meet the crisis which was to be prolonged.

22,Change sought in co-op laws,"vadodara: former planning commission member yk alagh has pledged to lobby for the co-operative sector as it finds itself on the threshold of a level-playing field with the corporates. alagh, addressing a conference on 'structuring co-operatives as dynamic business entities' organised by the baroda management association here on friday, said there was a pressing need to change strategic policies both at the level of the co-operatives and the government. alagh is also the chairman of a committee studying possibilities of having a chapter within the company law and has recommended formation of producer companies that can come under the ambit of the company law. the producers' company amendment bill 2000 to amend the company law so that rural producers can register themselves as producer companies, has been referred to the parliamentary standing committee on finances. alagh has called for efforts to ensure that the bill is passed. another of his recommendations was on providing an option that co-operatives, whose objectives, by way of activity and operations, extend beyond one state can voluntarily transfer to a producer company. talking on the state of agriculture, alagh said india succeeded in the doha round of wto discussions in getting its point across. ""we have successfully raised our concerns like livelihood and environment. countries like china and egypt are now toeing our line. union minister for commerce murasoli maran might have compromised a bit on environment, but made major gains on the agricultural front,"" he said. alagh hinted that india might have to cut subsidies in agriculture. india gives a relatively high subsidy of 29 per cent, asia's highest. ""china was asked to bring it down from 10 to five per cent. it accepted a rate of 8.5. similar pressures will build on us"", he said adding that many subsidies in india were useless. asked of the flight of some companies from india to china, alagh said that the trend was 'worrying'. ""we are not getting strategic responses to moves by china which affect our industry. such responses are the name of the game today and one has to act fast and at the same time act for things that might happen in the future. if any of our moves affected chinese interests, they would have hit our guts out,"" he said.
