0,Builders giving go-by to bye-laws,"bangalore: ** the bcc was demolishing certain portions, which deviated the maximum from the stipulated norms, of a seshadripuram hotel. a concocted stay order from bcc's appeals committee stalled the operations. the case is now in the court. ** thirty-five commercial buildings with basement violations have been left untouched by the bcc, even though the high court has ordered their demolition. ** nearly 21 multi-storey buildings, which had 211 per cent violations, were to be demolished. legal hurdles have been cleared, but the cases are gathering dust. the sorry state of affairs in the bcc, coupled with inefficiency and corruption, have paved the way for increasing number of building deviations in the city. plots in residential areas earmarked for single dwelling purpose are being converted into apartments without the sanctioned land conversion. sources said the cases of land conversion have increased by more than 40 per cent in bangalore as the authorities have failed to check such a growth. the big builders seem to be regularly flouting norms as the penalty invariably works out to a few thousands of rupees. here's a case in point: when two apartment blocks were built on the ""single dwelling"" land in koramangala iii block, the koramangala residents' vigilance group approached the court which delivered judgment in its favour. the court termed the building plans sanctioned by the bcc ""illegal"", quashed it and directed the authorities to demolish them, as it should be an ``eye-opener to the building by-law violators''. now the builders have approached the supreme court. ``in the first place, the bcc had no right to sanction building plans when the plot was for residential purpose. every time such orders are passed, the bcc fails to initiate action and the builders presume rules can be flouted with ease,'' the sources said. similarly, 35 multi-storey buildings in the city's upmarket areas, which had unauthorisedly used basements for other activities, were to be demolished as per the court order. till date, nothing has come of it. the 21 multi-storey buildings which have over 211 per cent deviations are untouched. to complicate the matters, the bcc's town planning committee had passed a resolution to regularise these buildings. subsequently, the government acted tough and issued a fresh order to the bcc to demolish it. however, the bcc is sitting over the cases. nearly six months ago, the bcc was gearing up to demolish several basements and had struck at a couple of them. but pressure from political circles hindered the operations, the sources alleged. similar was the case with a hotel. the demolition operation was on but a ""concocted"" stay order issued by bcc's appeals committee stalled the work. later it was found that the order was post-dated and fake. a criminal case was registered against the chairman and the members of the committee. the case is now in the court. common violations: ** deviating from the sanctioned plan of ground+2 floors and constructing further. ** converting single dwelling plot into apartments. ** using basements for commercial activities. ** violating the set-back area reservations. ** constructing commercial establishments in residential plots.

1,Hunt on for next principal chief conservator,"bangalore: the search is on for a new incumbent for the post of the principal chief conservator of forest (pccf) with the present incumbent shantaram adappa retiring on may 31. the seniormost officer next to adappa is jagajit lamba of 1964 batch. though lamba joined the forest service in 1969, his five-year stint in defence as short service commission (ssc) officer puts him in 1964 batch. sources said lamba's seniority was overlooked twice when a. sadashivaiah was selected as pccf in 1997, who was later succeeded by adappa. three factors may weigh in favour of lamba. 1) his seniority was overlooked twice; 2) he will retire in july; 3) the government may not wish to create problem for itself after dinakar's episode. next to lamba is m.l. ramprakash of the 1967 batch. sources said he opted for voluntary retirement in march this year following his differences with the government in the controversy related to karnataka pulpwood ltd. ramprakash was due to retire in january 2002. two other senior officers are pccf (evaluation, planning and training) s.n. raiand pccf (wildlife) s.k. chakrabarti of 1968 batch. sources said the committee consisting of dpar officers will meet in a day or two to finalise the name.

2,US-based firm allowed to be impleaded as a party in a PIL,"new delhi: the delhi high court has allowed an us-based internet company, skybiz.com, to be impleaded as a party in the public interest litigation in which it has been accused of promoting money circulation schemes in india. such schemes are banned under reserve bank of india rules. the application for the impleadment was moved by the petitioner's lawyer who told the court that the india office of the us company was in pune. besides the pune-based country office of the company, the forum of the indian ``associates'' - operating under the banner of skybiz associates' forum of india - has also been made party in the case. the chief justice bench, during an earlier hearing, had asked the petitioner whether it was possible for the court to proceed against the internet company whose office was located in the us. praying for impleadment, the petitioners' lawyer told the court that the india office of skybiz could be located from an advertisement in a local newspaper and the countrywide raids on may 11 by the enforcement directorate, which allegedly unearthed a rs 200 crore foreign exchange scam. the lawyers of skybiz and its associates forum challenged the maintainability of the pil and sought time to file an counter-affidavit. the bench adjourned the matter for july 19. meanwhile, the enforcement directorate informed the bench that the rbi had issued direction to all banks not to allow remittance of money to skybiz india ltd or any other overseas firm running schemes for sale of e-commerce web packages. ``the rbi had issued a circular on december 7, 2000, asking banks not to allow remittance to operators of such schemes or to any other overseas company carrying on activities like skybiz,'' the ed said in an affidavit filed before the court. the ed filed the affidavit following the allegations of sale of e-commerce web packages by skybiz in india for an annual payment of us $ 100 from each customer. according to the ed, this amounts to violation of foreign exchange management act and rbi rules. the government counsel told the court that ed ``was in the process of examining the matter against skybiz whether there is any violation of fema by the company.'' the petitioner's lawyer, gagan gupta, placed before the bench a recent website message by skybiz to its associates in india asking them to send their payments directly to the company in united states in us dollars in view of pending investigation by ed. in its message, the company had said that due to the ed probe, it had temporarily closed its office in india, gupta told the court. since the payment was sought by the company in us dollars and transferred abroad, the scheme amounted to violation of fema provisions and other laws governing foreign exchange policies and rules laid down by the rbi, the petitioner's lawyer said. ed's affidavit said though the company had been operating from us through its associates (agents) in india for quite sometime, complaints had been received by the directorate against it only in the first week of may. according to these complaints, certain companies had been set up in india which were ``promoting the operation of skybiz and are receiving payments from indian associates, which they allegedly are sending to the parent company in us,'' the ed said. ``detailed investigation is underway into the working of such companies and the operations related to skybiz.com in respect of the payment being made to it in us dollars through the indian operators,'' the ed said, adding that appropriate action as per law would be taken after the probe is completed. as per the company's scheme, the associates with whom it had agreements were eligible to collect commissions on all levels of their business and were authorised to organise presentation about sale of e-commerce packages, the pil said.

7,Mumbaiites to take traffic rules head on,"mumbai: mobile for a moment, immobile for life. this may be just a hoarding cautioning citizens about the dangers of using mobile phones while driving. but think of it, reality can't get closer than this. use of cellular phones by motorists not only endangers the life of the person in conversation but that of others too, most of them innocent pedestrians or people in other vehicles. since the attention of the speaker is distracted from the flowing traffic, the dangers of a sudden slowdown in the speed or change of lanes loom large, heightening the risk to both pedestrian and vehicular traffic. although the traffic police claims to be taking action against violators, people talking on phones while driving is a common sight. that constables and even officers turn a blind eye to such violations of law is an open secret indeed. last year, the police reportedly took action against 4,535 motorists. but according to citizens, the number of people who escape being caught may be many times more. explaining the reason behind many offenders getting away, a traffic constable said, ``out of nearly 50 vehicles at every signal, we spot around two drivers with mobile phones. in the time that it takes to penalise them, many others manage to get away.'' another rule violated with impunity is the one related to sticking of sun control films on car windows and rear glasses. according to rule, only films in the indian standard (is) 2553/2 category are permitted as the film provides protection against the sun and at the same time permits a policeman to have a clear view of the passengers in the vehicle. this task is definitely more difficult than spotting a person talking while driving, for, as even cops admit, there is no way of checking if the film conforms to norms. ``we can only hazard a guess,'' a constable confessed. last year, 10,858 cases had been registered for the offence. but a fine of rs 100 has ensured that the rule is not taken too seriously. another common traffic-related problem is the use of non-conforming licence plates. the central motor vehicle (cmv) rules clearly state that the thickness and the height of the letters on the number plate should not be less than 10 mm and 65 mm respectively. it also states that the space between two letters should be not be less than 10 mm. however, these specifications, according to the mumbai traffic police, simply mean that the number plates should not be ``fancy''. and what ``fancy'' means is apparently left to the imagination of each constable. fancy number plates make it difficult for constable to jot down the registration number of vehicles involved in hit and run cases. besides, traffic cops also find it difficult to take down the numbers of vehicles which jump signals or violate other regulations. but not many officers and constables seem to know that the number plates are not permitted to be in devnagri script. ironically, many government and municipal vehicles have their number plates in this script.

8,"Bhujbal, Chavan clash over tax break for multiplexes","mumbai: deputy chief minister chhagan bhujbal''s grandiose proposal to offer a five-year tax holiday to multiplexes to be constructed across the state has been opposed by revenue minister ashok chavan. a comprehensive proposal, on constructing multiplexes, a string of two or more cinema halls, a shopping mall, virtual reality simulators and food bars in the same complex and exempting them from payment of entertainment tax, was prepared for the approval of the state cabinet which met on wednesday. however, following chavan''s refusal to endorse the move mooted by bhujbal, the proposal was withdrawn at the last minute, mantralaya sources told times of india. although chavan, who belongs to the congress, has offered a perfect alibi for his stand, stating that it would hit the ailing state economy, his decision is said to be politically motivated. bhujbal is a senior member of the nationalist congress party (ncp), which is a major partner in the eight-party democratic front (df) combine. ``an entertainment tax holiday for a entertainment-cum-cinema halls is not advisable as they are charging rs 100 and more for every ticket. the exorbitant ticket rates are a discouraging factor even for an avid cinema lover. moreover, the state would loose substantial revenue if this proposal is okayed,'''' an official told this newspaper. the issue has been a bone of contention between the two major coalition partners with chief minister vilasrao deshmukh finally intervening in the matter. the proposal has been forwarded to the cm for clearance and is likely to be taken up at the next week''s cabinet meeting. the state government had earlier entered into an agreement with warner brothers for the construction of 10 multiplexes across the state. the deal, however, fizzled out as the u.s. movie giant had no intentions to go beyond mumbai and thane. the city has in the recent past witnessed a steady rise in such cinema halls which were constructed after the demolition of the old theatres. cinemax, which is the first of its kind, was constructed at goregaon the site previously used by samrat theatre. similarly, the famous apsara theatre at grant road has been pulled down with plans in full swing for the construction of two cinema halls complete with a shopping centre. mr bhujbal, in a press statement issued early this week, had advocated the construction of multiplexes in the state. he had stated that the new age cinema halls would be asked to compulsorily screen marathi films once in a year.

9,New food minister is without an office,"kolkata: minister in charge of the department of food processing and horticulture sailen sarkar is not to be seen anywhere near his department at mayukh bhavan in salt lake. instead he still sits in the writers' buildings. the reason: the creation of a new ministry for food processing and horticulture - separating it from the ministry of sunderban affairs - has led to the new minister having no chamber or room to call his own. a week has passed since sarkar took oath of office as the new minister. but as yet no initiative has been taken to carve out a room for the minister in the fourth floor of mayukh bhavan which houses the food processing and horticulture department. though a section of the department appears to be disappointed at the minister being allotted a room in writers' buildings, but the bureaucracy is happy that a separate ministry has been carved out. this move according to them, would accelerate completion of pending projects. sources within the department confirmed that the national horticulture board, the apex body which plans and funds projects, is also scheduled to shift its office to salt lake from tollygunge to make mayukh bhaban a centre of all horticultural operations. ""we have a large array of projects in hand and with a separate minister we expect things to look up,"" said jayanta kumar mitra, managing director of the west bengal state food processing and horticulture development corporation limited. talking about the projects mitra said, ""we will produce hybrid vegetable seeds at krishnagar through joint ventures with private firms. almost 30 acres of land has been earmarked for the project. this would be the first of its kind in eastern india since all vegetable seeds available here comes from manufacturers in western india, "" said mitra. ""we are interacting with three companies of which 'bjosheetal india' a netherlands based company with advanced technology in hybrid seed production, is one,"" he said. the floriculture project at panskura is only in its first phase, mitra said. ""the panskura project is expected to be completed within another one and a half years at a total cost of rs 5 crores only the first phase has been completed at an expense of almost rs 90 lakhs,"" he said. a senior official said, ""the minister during a meet at the salt lake office confirmed that he would not like to deviate from decisions taken by his predecessor but would like to speed up the execution of projects and to us that is the best thing that could happen"".
