3,Many hold double passports against law,"hyderabad: thousands of people hold more than one passport against the rules. the extra passports are either got on a variation of one's name or on a different name altogether. it is estimated that at least 15 per cent of the total 20 lakh passports that have been issued from the rpo here in the last 10 years are such passports. the passport office here on an average detects 50 such extra passports people hold. this is detected when people apply for fresh passports and the details are found to be similar from what have been submitted to the passport office earlier. this is also detected when applicants come for renewal or some other services like change in name. since there are thousands of double passports which people hold and have not been detected, the regional passport officer has come out with a scheme to regularise such passports. the passport holder will be allowed to hold one passport and return the extra one. though according to the passport act, 1967, the passport authorities can lodge a police complaint against those who hold more than one passport and prosecute them, the passport office is offering not to pursue cases if a penalty of rs 5,000 is paid. ""people should make use of this offer now. otherwise, if we detect that more than one passport is held by a person, he or she will be prosecuted,"" rpo, hyderabad, m sevala naik told ""the times of india"" here on monday. in august, the passport office here will get a new software by which, it will be easy to detect if a person applying for a new passport already has one. from the details submitted to the passport office, the new software will scan the index cards of all passport holders containing similar information. the photographs, and other details like name, father's name and even identification marks will be compared and if the person is found to be holding a passport already, he will be prosecuted. the passport office in delhi already has the software and hyderabad will be the only other city in the country which will have it to begin with. the software has been developed by national informatics centre. according to sevala naik, double passports used to be usually acquired by people who went to the gulf for jobs by changing their names. this was possible as there was no proper verification check done by the police.

4,Bihar govt to set up bomb disposal squads,"patna: keeping in view the stepped up activities of the extremist outfits and isi in different parts of the state, the bihar government has decided to set up bomb disposal squads in 15 districts. the squads would diffuse the bombs before they are used by the extremists. though there has been no instance of isi-engineered bombs blasts in bihar, the use of bombs and land mines by extremists is quite common. the bihar government is concerned about the blasts, masterminded by the isi, in other parts of the country and it does not want to take any chance in this regard. it is more alert after the arrest of hardcore isi men in sitamarhi and other districts bordering nepal. the state government had set up a bomb disposal squad under the special branch of the police headquarters after the series of bomb blasts in bombay and calcutta, but that proved inadequate to deal with the task of diffusing bombs in different districts of the state. subsequently, the government felt it tactically prudent that each district must have its own bomb disposal squad which could quickly react to the situation in the event of detection of bombs. the government has spared a sum of rs 43.3 lakh to open up 15 such squads at the range and zonal police headquarters level. the money, earmarked for the purpose, would be mainly spent on purchase of equipment such as blasting machine, electronics stethoscope, gas guns, chemical kit for detection of explosives, wire and cable locator, water cannon, prodder, mobile bomb, sealed rsp tool kit and zoom binoculars. but the very purpose of the state government to equip the police force with latest gadgets and tackle unforeseen situations, specially those of diffusing the live bombs, is being defeated as police personnel, specially in the constabulary and asi, si ranks are not inclined to join the bomb disposal squad. a senior police officer said that when police personnel were sent to undergo training of diffusing live bombs in different police training institutes in the country, including manesar (haryana), the trainees `deliberately fared poor in the test' so that they are not considered for inclusion in the squad. he said the police headquarters now has decided to take a tough stand so that the `erring' officers might not get away easily and posting of police personnel to the squad is ensured.

5,"BSP focuses on Punjab, UP issues for polls","new delhi: the bahujan samaj party sought to club together the issues facing both uttar pradesh and punjab through a demonstration on monday, apparently with an eye on assembly polls, due in both states within months.

party leaders kanshiram and mayawati addressed a rally outside parliament house, demanding a ban on bonded labour in punjab and an end to atrocities on dalits in up.

``the prakash singh badal government has failed to implement the law in this regard and the centre should take action against it,'''' bsp president kanshiram said. he claimed that the number of bonded labourers in punjab was about five lakh.

the party leaders deplored the up government''s proposal for a sub-quota for the most backward castes as well as the most backward among the scheduled castes, terming it as ``political opportunism''''.

by holding the rally on the opening day of parliament''s monsoon session, the bsp clearly sent out a signal that unlike other opposition parties raising the agra summit failure or uti crash, its priority is the electoral battles in up and punjab.

so long the party has been concentrating on up by making pre-poll moves, keeping in mind the changing political and social equations in the state. with the rally focusing on punjab, the party clearly made an effort to put both states together in preparation for the assembly elections.
