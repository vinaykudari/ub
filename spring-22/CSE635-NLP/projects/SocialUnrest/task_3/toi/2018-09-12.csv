0,State govt moves Supreme Court in PCCF case,"ahmedabad: gujarat government has moved an appeal in the supreme court of india against the order of gujarat high court to appoint chief conservator of forests (social forestry) ashok kumar to the post of principal chief conservator of forests. dr sanat chavan, the chief conservator of forests (narmada), was appointed to the post of the pccf from august 1, following retirement of d p s verma. however, kumar who is senior to chavan, had objected to the appointment and moved the high court. he was chosen for the post by the departmental promotion committee (dpc) last year but he was not appointed. once again, the committee met on july 31, 2001, despite the pending recommendation of the earlier dpc. kumar was not appointed after the meeting but was instead handed over a charge-sheet and chavan, also an indian forest service officer of 1968 batch as kumar, was appointed. the charge levelled against him was that when he was conservator of forests of mehsana, in capacity of a disciplinary authority, he had not given sufficient punishment to a range forest officer for forging the documents regarding payment of salary to a beat guard. kumar had submitted that he was victimised and was denied promotion by manipulation, which was upheld by the court. highly placed sources in the forest department claim that there were number of charges pending against kumar and the file was with the forest and environment minister, kanjibhai patel, who had not forwarded it to the chief minister for initiating action. it is also believed that a charge-sheet based on just one of the several charges was prepared and handed in a haste. moreover, the state government has also set up an inquiry by retired ias officer c r biswas into the report submitted by the state vigilance commission on charges against kumar. the report is expected sometime later this month. considering the fact that kumar was due for retirement on september 31, the state was not allowed a stay on the order in order to approach the supreme court. the high court had asked the state government to immediately appoint him but the state preferred to move the apex court. following this a contempt petition was also filed in the high court, on which the high court issued notice to additional chief secretary for environment and forests p k ghosh to remain personally present before the court on september 14, to purge the notice. the high court had described the charge-sheet as ""stale"" and observed that the only reason for it was to deny him the legitimate right to be promoted and posted as pccf of gujarat. it was also questioned that though there were two posts of the pccf, the other one being that of the managing director of the gujarat state forest development corporation, why was the other post downgraded.

1,Wary govt bars teachers from by-election duty,"ahmedabad: teachers who took part in the strike are likely to lose out on the extra bread that usually followed an election with the sabarkantha and ahmedabad district administration having reportedly 'barred' them from duty in the by-elections scheduled on september 20. instead the sabarkantha district education officer has invited guardians to run schools on a daily allowance of rs 200! the temporary office created is that of a 'visiting teacher', who, according to the release, should be eligible to perform the duties of a teacher. observers feel that this teaching duty could also stretch on to 'polling duty'. as if this was not enough, the ahmedabad district administration would conduct an 'audit' on the teachers and evaluate how best have school premises and the grants been used. teams would visit each school beginning tuesday and assess 'possible violations'. in a smart move on monday, sabarkantha deo in a press release invited guardians to form a committee and help manage schools. every candidate would be paid rs 200. congress leaders who had questioned the budget proposal in the assembly to recruit vidya vyavsay preraks in schools and vidya sahayaks for promoting literacy in tribal areas said the decision on 'visiting teachers' was "" another move to rig elections by using unfair means as the bjp knows it is losing"". interestingly, these moves have been made only in districts that go to polls in less than a fortnight, thus indicating a possible nexus between the strike and the elections. the office of the chief election officer, however, does not feel that this will affect elections in any way. according to deputy election officer jp jadeja, ""polling duty is basically for primary teachers who are not on strike and secondary teachers are roped in only as the last resort"". he added that the election office would rope in the services of the panchayat and central employees. officials say that at least 8,000 people would be employed on polling duty in the sabarkantha parliamentary constituency while 2,000 will be deployed in the sabarmati assembly constituency. officials from the ahmedabad collectorate were also assured that polling would not be affected by the strike. ""we have begun our training programmes for those who will be on election duty and each participant will be paid rs 225 "", an official said. according to an official in the sabarkantha deo, the teachers who have repeatedly revealed their anti-bjp stand, have virtually lost the confidence of the people and their integrity is not beyond apprehension. the returning officers, both of sabarkantha and banaskantha as four talukas of banaskantha (danta, vadagam, amirgadh and 58 villages of palanpur) come under the sabarkantha constituency) are believed to have received instructions to this effect. bjp workers during their electioneering meeting are learnt to have demanded that teachers be kept away from the work of presiding or polling officers in view of their anti-party statements repeatedly made during their agitation. even college teachers from both the districts are being enlisted for election duties, the official said.

5,"After 18 hours, Kutch farmers end siege of GEB office","bhuj/vadodara: drastic cut in power supply by the gujarat electricity board to rural areas evoked an angry reaction from kutch's farmers, who laid siege to a geb office in bhuj. the siege, however, ended after 18 hours on tuesday morning. the protest was organised by the bharatiya kisan sangh. the sangh brought together nearly 5,000 farmers who, on monday morning, gheraoed geb officials. the protest was a result of the cut in electricity supply to the agriculture sector effected by the geb, which is facing a problem meeting demand following failure of the expected last round of rainfall in the state. farmers, who kicked off a dharna on monday morning, left for their homes only around 5 am on tuesday, following assurance from the geb headquarters in vadodara. nearly 180 geb officials were forced to stay inside the office because of the siege. the agitation also paralysed traffic on a busy road. over 5000 farmers kicked off the dharna on the most busy road of bhuj -- the one linking the army cantonment to jubilee ground and the hospital road. superintendent of police, kutch, vivek shrivastava and other officials rushed to the spot. stringent security measures were taken. leaders and geb officials had several rounds of negotiation but no compromise could be arrived at by midnight. sv machhar, the superintendent engineer of kutch circle of geb, said following shortage of power to the tune of 1700 mw in gujarat, power supply had to be curtailed. geb chairman nalin bhatt said geb would give nine hours of three-phase power supply to farmers. at present, farmers get 7 to 8 hours of three-phase power supply; this had irked the farmers. energy minister kaushik patel said it was not possible to concede their demand of 14 hours of three-phase supply as the state was experiencing huge shortage of power on account of failure of the last round of monsoon. owing to this, demand for power had gone up by around 1748 mw since august 26. farmers had alleged that geb was responsible for the present situation in kutch and banaskantha. patel said efforts were being made to increase hours of power supply to farmers to nine hours, depending on the availability of power . another reason that irked farmers was adoption of ""made off"" system by geb in the two districts. these farmers felt that the power shortage in the two districts was primarily due to this system. this system was installed to ward off power thefts in the districts. during the eight-hour single-phase power supply in the area, farmers used converters to run motors in their fields, which increased load on the power line. in order to prevent this kind of power theft, power supply was ""made off"". in a bid to divert more power to the agriculture sector, and with rural areas remaining without the eight-hour power supply every day, the geb had asked high-tension and low-tension non-continuous industries in the state to observe one day additional weekly holiday beginning last friday. power thus saved is diverted to meet the ever-increasing demand for power by the agriculture sector.

6,MSU election plank: Leaders offer to have odd-jobs done,"vadodara: getting one's identity card renewed, filling out exam forms, or getting a library card made, one would assume that these were mundane odd-jobs. but think again. in the maharaja sayajirao university here the election manifestos of most student leaders includes promises to get all these jobs done without the hassle of standing in long queues. ""vote for us, we will help you get all work done at the administrative office"" is a commonly heard refrain on campus. not just that, student leaders in fact have already started doing such jobs for students to win their favour. ""we have a better rapport with the administrative staff here. if a student goes to get his id card or library card done it would take him longer. but a student leader wields power and the staff members know that they have to work quick to avoid trouble. so we help students,"" says a candidate who is standing for the past of 'faculty representative' at the faculty of commerce. ""if i can get my work done quicker by delegating it to student leaders, then why not. but the problem is that once elections are over they are hardly seen and if there is a genuine problem its difficult to track them,"" says anjali m, a second year student. however, many student leaders say that they have also taken up several serious issues in the past. bharat dangar former students' union general secretary says it was only after they intervened that the university authorities took up the work of repairing roads on the campus. ""we had also organised agitation to fight for student's rights, on many occasions,"" he said. some students, however, hold a different opinion. ""if disrupting classes through blaring noise, quarrels and slogans is 'helping' the student, then we prefer not to have any of it,"" says sanjay dave an sybcom student. according to him most student leaders do not have much to promise, as they are a reflection of the politicians in the outside world. ""but sometimes student leaders do help us in getting work done quicker as the university administrative staff are more alert to the needs of the student leaders. this again is a reflection of the outside world where people have to go through councillors to get basic civic amenities from the authorities,"" he says. truly the university is a grand training ground for future politicians.

14,State govt shied away from reality,"hyderabad: the collapse of the southern power grid on tuesday, which was on the cards for a while, could have been prevented had the states that are a party to the grid, followed prudent grid management principles. the first and foremost was to ensure a supply-demand match, something that none of the states are capable of at present as the demand outstrips supply. in the face of such a situation, the other option was to regulate power, not just by playing on semantics calling power cuts as 'load relief' measures but by introducing a formal system of load shedding. andhra pradesh, a state that took the lead in power sector reforms, was no different on these fronts. it could have led the way in at least partly solving the problem by educating the consumer that it was essential to conserve power in view of the critical situation, something that was done in a half-hearted manner by transmission corporation of andhra pradesh limited (transco) which limited itself to a press release calling consumers to save power. what was required, and continues to be done more so in the wake of tuesday's grid collapse, is a sustained campaign for saving electricity so what little is available is supplied where it is needed most, to the essential services like water supply authorities, hospitals, transport and farming sectors by imposing cuts on the domestic sector which can surely take in its stride an hour or two of power cut every day. but more than anything else, what is needed is courage on the part of the government as well as transco, to call the bluff they have been perpetuating for so long and tell the truth about the power supply situation to the people.

15,"State not utilising Central funds, alleges minister","jalgaon: m.k. anna patil, the newly inducted union minister of state for rural development, has charged that the democratic front (df) government in maharashtra was not fully utilising the funds sanctioned by the centre for its various schemes. speaking to reporters, the union minister said the central government was committed to provide fresh funds if the state governments utilised the funds sanctioned to them earlier. however, the state governments often fail to even lift the share of their funds, mr patil said, adding that the union rural development ministry's budget is rs 12,000 crore. the state governments would be given funds for implementation of the union ministry's schemes, but it is often noticed that the states are indifferent about utilising these funds, mr patil said. former minister and state bjp secretary eknath khadse, who was present on the occasion, said the state had not used central funds to the tune of rs 300 crore. mr patil, who came here for the first time after his induction into the union cabinet, was accorded a rousing welcome in his home district. the city bjp's office was also illuminated on the occasion. explaining his point, the union minister said the centre had sanctioned a grant of rs 12 crore for various schemes in jalgaon district. the funds have remained unutilised in the government treasury and no one has taken any initiative to use them, he said. mr patil refuted the charge that the centre was giving a step-motherly treatment to maharashtra government. the df government was claiming that the centre was not sanctioning funds for various works while at the same time, it was not using the funds given to it, he said. mr patil said he would extend full co-operation to the state government to deal with the present water scarcity situation in the state. the union minister said chief minister deshmukh had sought from the central government a grant of rs 200 crore. prime minister atal behari vajpayee had told mr deshmukh that the central government would take a decision on the grant only after deputing a team to the state. mr deshmukh had, however, not held back this information from the media, mr patil alleged. the state government was always lamenting that it had no funds, but it was not using the funds allotted to it by the centre, he said.

18,'Terrorism is being used as a political weapon',"new delhi: the home minister, l k advani, on wednesday hoped that the terrorist attacks in us would help strengthen the resolve of the international community to unitedly face and combat 'more effectively' the challenge posed by terrorism. ""this is not madness. after great deal of thinking, the terrorists chose the world trade centre, the pentagon and the state department as targets. terrorism has been used as a political weapon and the attacks were part of a well planned conspiracy,"" advani told reporters here. asked how could india assist the us in investigating the strikes, advani said, ""we will wait for the steps taken by the us to deal with the unprecedented episode"". stating that external affairs minister jaswant singh spoke to the us authorities on telephone on tuesday night, the home minister said new delhi and washington were cooperating in combating the menace through an indo-us joint working group on terrorism. on the decision taken by the cabinet committee on security which met on tuesday night in the wake of the strikes, advani said security measures have been further tightened at high-risk targets like airports and other vital installations in the country. for india, advani said, the biggest challenge was cross-border terrorism.

""it is said that i was promoted from minister of state to cabinet rank in the nda government only because i am a muslim, i don't see that such a statement would cause any harm either to me or the pm or the bjp. i told some of my community people, who had extended their support to me during the lok sabha election, that you elected only one muslim as mp, who became a minister in the union cabinet. help more muslim candidates to become mps and see the result"", he added. he said that his entry into the union cabinet, first as a minister of state and later as a cabinet minister had wiped out the `anti-muslim' image of the bjp and appealed to the members of his community to come under the bjp banner in more numbers. he further stated that on his promotion as a cabinet minister one of the senior congress leaders from up rang him up and said: ""you snatched away one of our election issues to be raised in the coming up assembly election."" hussain said that both prasad and rudy were inducted into the union cabinet only on the basis of their performance as mps in the rajya sabha and the lok sabha respectively. he said that he was not a new entrant in the union cabinet, as it was his fifth portfolio. but since both prasad and rudy were new entrants, they deserved to be given public reception as `naye dulhe'. bjp's state president nand kishore yadav presided over the function, which was conducted by party's patna mahanagar president harendra singh. union minister of state for coal and mines prasad said that being a `karyakarta' he would fight for the cause of bihar under the federal structure. ""after my induction i told the pm that since floods in bihar were caused by flooded rivers emanating from nepal, some concrete measures should be taken with the nepal government to solve this problem. pm assured me that he was aware of the situation and there would be a high-level talk with the nepal government soon on the issue"", he added. union minister of state for industry and commerce rudi said that for the sake of development of bihar he would do everything possible defying even the protocol, since the state had a great potential of development. he underlined the need of a change in the present set up in bihar, ""which a different country with different constitution in vogue"". it was strange that in such a state with good population blood bank of the patna medical college and hospital (pmch) had been denotified. other bjp leaders also spoke on the occasion.

25,Rural development in Saurashtra goes high-tech,"rajkot: ""gam-no-choro""(village meeting place) has been a focal point, for the cluster of actives in the rural areas. over the ages. but, that may not be so now, perhaps. a new wave of change, that is sweeping the countryside, is poised to reshape the traditional ""choro' into a modern, multi-purpose community tele-centre. the rural scene in saurashtra is undergoing a dramatic transformation. thanks to the hi-tech revolution. and, also to the sustained efforts of the technocrat-wizard sam pitroda. technology for change. . is the refrain in the villages, which are poised to take a big leap in the sectoral growth. unesco and the itu-international telecommunications union are the main sponsors and collaborators of this new concept of having tele-centres, which could serve as ""super store of services"". about a dozen such centres, known as ""multi-purpose community tele-centres"" are to be set up in rajkot district of saurashtra. this is for the first time in india that such a new concept is taking off. maheshbhai v. joshi, district development officer of rajkot, said that telecentre is a new concept for rural and remotely located people to foster the community participation and to bring new opportunities for their economic development. the centre makes use of the latest tele-communications and computer technology to provide the services that can be used by everybody. the tele-centre is a friendly local community centre, equipped with hi-tech facilities, he said, where the people in the rural areas can get, at their door-step, almost every service for which they have to rush to rajkot. the people in the rural areas can get current market rates of agriculture produce and sell their produce at the best prices without the middle man; can have access to education packages developed for specific target groups; consult specialist medical services through video-conferencing; register themselves at employment exchange; send their growing children to become familiar with computers. they can also get information of various welfare schemes of the government and file applications in the various departments of the state government; pay telephone, electricity and water bills; avail std-pco, fax, internet, e-mail, word processing services. the services, to be provided at such tele-centres, would be, of course, at a price. the tariff is yet to be decided, ddo joshi said and added that the whole concept was to make it self-sustaining. the district project management committee, with representatives from different departments and agencies, has been formed. a similar committee has also been formed at the state-level. he said that the modalities for running these centres were being worked out. the current thinking was to have a local management committee, which will ensure the involvement and participation of the rural folk. the tele-centre would be run by a manager, with competent staff. . all of them paid. it was also proposed to involve ngos-non government organisations too with this project. according to joshi, it was a perspective planning, spread over next five years, designed to give a new exposure to the rural-folk. before the project was taken up for implementation, a survey was done by a team from the indian institute of management, ahmedabad. the project can sow the seeds of computer literacy and network culture in the rural india, which can develop a demographic cohort of future users, thereby reducing imbalances in regional development and sectoral growth. the basic objectives were to develop co-operative efforts, integrate the role of tele-communications in the strategies for health care improvement, employment generation, administrative and other needs of rural development. a note-worthy feature of the tele-centre project is to bridge the gap between info-rich and info-poor, serving as a short-cut for fulfilling the universal social obligation. p c gupta, former general manager of rajkot telecom district, had contributed, in a big way, to initiate this project. a memorandum of understanding was signed by department of tele-communications, unesco and the government of gujarat to set up a chain of such multi-purpose tele-centres in the rural areas. recently, a four-member team of officials visited australia, where such tele-centres were working for the past 10 years or so. the team included sheela benjamin, additional commissioner, rural development, mahesh joshi, ddo, rajkot, akhilesh kumar pande, deputy general manager, rajkot telecom district and b d parmar, civil surgeon of rajkot. the team, which spent about a week, saw seven such tele-centres in western australia, mostly in perth and surrounding areas. these centres are self-sustaining. from traditional to modern. . a far-cry indeed, over the past five decades. . the rural development had taken off in the form of ""community development projects"" of the early fifties'. . three decades later came the irdp-integrated rural development programme. . and now, the rural development goes hi-tech. . the villages, which have been identified, to be covered under the multi-purpose community tele-centre project are: moti marad, bhayavadar, jam kandorna, derdi, malia miyana, khareda, mahika, vinchhiya, paddhari, lodhika, kotda sangani, charan samadhiyala. it is understood that the first tele-centre may take off shortly in paddhari, about 25km. from rajkot.
