The cable operators also marched to the office of Pathankot SP Manminder Singh and handed him a memorandum of demands. The SP told Times News Network that the matter was amicably solved in the evening.

1,Teachers vie with one another to become officiating principal,"BATHINDA: A feverish race is on among teachers of SSD Girls College here for the post of officiating principal. All the hopefuls have had been trying to ingratiate themselves with the college management for more than one year.

The controversy started when the management allegedly violated norms and appointed a junior lecturer as officiating principal. Now, the situation is getting out of hand because of groupism among the members of SSD Sabha Bathinda and their meddling in the management of the college, said reliable sources. The battle for the plum post is getting more partisan and bitter with every passing day.

In fact, five heads of the departments in the college have sought the intervention of the vice-chancellor of Punjabi University, Patiala, on Thursday to resolve the issue.

The teachers alleged that after the retirement of Mrs S Bhasin, the regular principal in the college in January 2000, no regular principal had been appointed so far. In a letter to V-C, P Bakshi, head of Punjabi department, Veena Sharma, head of political science department, Darshana Bansal, head of economics department, Promila Rani, head of English department and Jaswinder Kaur, head of music department in the college alleged that the controversy started last year when the management violated norms to appoint a junior lecturer as officiating principal so that she could use the tag of retired principal post retirement.

Raj Kansal, a senior lecturer, who was working as officiating principal since January 2000 was forced to proceed on long leave by the management so that the junior lecturer could be appointed as officiating principal superseding three other senior lecturers, alleged the teachers.

Though the university rules say that the senior most teacher in a college would only be appointed as officiating principal, but in the college a junior teacher was appointed for the office for her closeness with some members of the management body, alleged these teachers.

P Bakshi, who claimed herself to be the senior most teacher in the college and was officiating principal of the college till March 31 this year, alleged that on March 31 the college management pressurised her to go on leave for giving the post to a junior teacher.

And even after the junior teacher retired as officiating principal on May 31, the college management did not allow Bakshi to take charge of the principal''s office and appointed another junior teacher to the post, alleged Bakshi and other teachers in the letter. They urged the V-C to take the matter seriously as it was causing irreparable loss to the students and the stature of the college.

2,Long arm of law catches up with Gujarat cops,"AHMEDABAD/VADODARA/SURAT: Anti Corruption Bureau sleuths nabbed a head constable posted in the Sankheda police station while he was accepting a bribe from a bootlegger on June 7.

.A day later, the Bharuch police established the involvement of Fatehgunj police sub inspector TJ Vaghela in the abduction of an NRI, Adam Gabhanwala.

.A month ago, the Rajkot district SP terminated the services of 17 policemen â€” of ranks ranging from sub-inspector and below â€” on charges of rape, molestation, gambling and drinking.

The dark deeds of the stateâ€™s men in khaki are surfacing like never before, with the trend of policemen finding themselves on the wrong side of the law on the rise.

And many feel it is the system that should be blamed.

When Padmakar Ananda, a police constable in Vadodara was arrested on June 2 for his alleged involvement in the murder of Pravinchandra Shah, the new city police chief Sudhir Sinha was candid in his assessment: â€œGovernment officials indulge in crime due to lack of accountability in the system.â€�

Many have even tried to misuse the power they wield. On June 11, three constables of the crime branch in Ahmedabad were placed under suspension for demanding Rs 1 lakh from a transporter, Shibu Anthony, a resident of Vasna.

They had threatened to book him under prohibition laws but Anthony turned the tables on them by registering a complaint with senior officials.

On occasion, policemen have become an embarrassment for the force. Ahmedabad policeâ€™s image took a beating when, during a raid last year in the Vatva area, crime branch sleuths not only recovered brown sugar worth Rs 5 crore, but also found a head constable of CID (crime) â€” Vinod Dantani â€” in a â€œcompromising positionâ€� with the prime accused, Khatunbibi Ansari. Cash amounting to Rs 1.57 lakh was also recovered from Dantaniâ€™s room in a hotel at Vatva.

â€œMany a time, policemen have failed in their duty and even cheated their own force,â€� says a senior official. On June 8, head constable Natwarbhai Damor and police constable Vikrambhai Gohil were arrested by the Ahmedabad police on the charge of letting off an undertrial prisoner â€” Purushottam Madrasi â€” a bootlegger booked under PASA.

In Surat, three police officials â€” inspectors SA Desai and CM Mudliar and assistant sub-inspector Chiman Mansingh â€” have been charged with siphoning off valuables worth Rs 8.87 lakh from the Rander police station over the past five years.

â€œWhenever a police official is caught breaking the law, I have always been more strict with him than I would be with a member of the general public,â€� says Ahmedabad police commissioner KR Kaushik.

When posted as Rajkot police chief, Kaushik had booked three policemen under PASA after they were found guilty of being part of a bootlegging and extortion racket.

Many even blame the flourishing bootlegging racket for the largescale corruption in the police force.

And probably, not without reason.

Recently, as many as 10 police inspectors were suspended after rampant bootlegging was detected in areas under their control.

3,Six police officials arrested for killing youth in custody,"AHMEDABAD: Six city police officials were arrested on Thursday. The policemen have been booked in connection with the custodial death of Mohammadriaz Badruddin Shaikh (27).

Shaikh had died on January 27, 2003, after allegedly being assaulted by a team of Danilimda policemen.

Shaikh, along with his friend Shahid Shaikh (20), had been nabbed for possessing one pouch of countrymade liquor.

Family members of the victim and eye-witnesses to the incident said that Shahid had bought the pouch from Chandkheda and was about to share it with Shaikh on the evening of January 23, when the police team marched in, hurled abuses at them and started beating them in front of the residents of Ektanagar, a slum in Danilimda.

Police officials, on the other hand, had claimed that Shaikh was arrested because of his involvement in illicit-liquor trade. After being taken to the Danilimda police station, the duo were further assaulted. Shaikh collapsed at the police station. The police officials then made Shahid take Shaikh to the V S Hospital.

The Danilimda police, meanwhile, informed the victimâ€™s family members that Shaikh had fainted in the police station and was in V S Hospital.

Shaikh never regained consciousness and died on January 27. When the matter was taken up aggressively before the police authorities by Shaikhâ€™s family members and residents of Ektanagar, police officials of Danilimda said that Shaikh had banged his head against a wall when he had fallen unconscious at the police station. A complaint against the â€œguiltyâ€� police officials had been lodged by Dilshabano Yasinbhai Shaikh, sister-in-law of the deceased.

An inquiry into the case was initiated under the supervision of ACP (K Division) K R Jadav by police authorities, while PI of Danilimda B H Surti, along with the six other policemen, were transferred from the police station. Subsequently, a magisterial enquiry was also initiated under section 176 of CrPC, concerning custodial death.

Investigation into the case was later handed over to ACP (F Division) S P Oza. The police enquiry found assistant sub-inspector Motibhai Jyotabhai Patel, head constable Ramanbhai Chhaganbhai along with four police constables, Ratilal Karsanbhai Rathod, Gulabji Dhulaji Banucha, Jaisukhbhai Shyamjibhai Jhala and Samir Samsuddin Shaikh, guilty and booked under sections 304, 217, 323 and 114 of IPC.

Oza told TNN, â€œThe six police officials have been arrested for acting in such a manner that led to the death of another person.â€� The police officials, who had been â€œabscondingâ€� after found guilty, had even moved the sessions court for a pre-emptive bail petition. The bail petition was later turned down by the court.

While Ramanbhai was arrested on Wednesday, the other five were nabbed on Thursday afternoon. Police officials told TNN, â€œDepartmental proceeding is also likely to be initiated against Surti. He was not present at the site where the incident took place, but is being held responsible as he as PI was in charge of the police station when Shaikh and Shahid were being assaulted.â€�

6,Amarsinh demands minister's scalp in co-op bank scam,"GANDHINAGAR: Opposition Congress leader Amarsinh Chaudhary on Thursday demanded that Chief Minister Narendra Modi summarily dismiss Prabhatsinh Chauhan, a junior minister in the Modi government, for the latterâ€™s alleged involvement in Rs 129 crore Panchmahals District Co-operative Bank scam.

â€œIt is the government-appointed administrator who has filed an FIR against the minister as also two other BJP MLAs.There is no reason to wait now,â€� Chaudhary said.

The government, on the other hand, appeared to take a cautious stand, with top Modi confidantes insisting that any step against the minister would be â€œprematureâ€� till investigations are carried out and facts established. A top-level official meeting was held in registrar of co-operatives Prakash Shahâ€™s office to look into the district bankâ€™s problems, while another is planned for June 16.

â€œI have asked for full report from the investigating officers. These facts should be corroborated with necessary documents to establish whether Chauhan was present at the meetings in which a wrong decision was taken. Also, one would need to verify what stand Chauhan took towards giving of loans,â€� said minister of state for home Amit Shah.

Shah said â€œmore persons were involved in scams relating to 36 co-operative banks during the Congress rule but were easily bailed out.â€� He added, â€œOn the face of it, Chauhan or the board of directors of the bank are not guilty. It is the two â€˜mandlisâ€™ who took the loan that had produced false documents. Yet, one would need to be doubly sure.â€�

Meanwhile, top officials said, government-appointed administrator H J Mehta would not have given a report without verifying facts.

â€œMehta was selected to look into the Panchmahals bankâ€™s problems after a top-level meeting here in Gandhinagar. Normally, such an administrator is appointed by the stroke of pen by a class one officer.He is a no-nonsense officer. Only after it was found that something was fishy that he dared file an FIR against the minister,â€� said a senior official.

Contradicting Shah on large-scale involvement of Congress leaders, Chaudhary said, â€œWho stops BJP from taking action against any of them? Here we find names of important BJP leaders like C R Patel, Kanaksinh Mangrola, Deepak Sathi, Chiman Sathi, Gopalsinh Solanki, Prabhatsinh Chauhan, to name just a few, involved in multi-crore scams. Congressmen, if at all, were involved in small misappropriations worth a few thousand.â€�

8,Furnish list of encroachers: HC to govt,"KOCHI: A division bench of the Kerala High Court on Thursday granted four weeks'' time to the state government to furnish the list of persons who were found to have encroached upon forest land after January 1, 1977 and those who had been evicted during the last one year.

The directions were issued by the bench, comprising Chief Justice J L Gupta and Justice A K Basheer, on a public interest litigation by the Nature Lovers movement, Thiruvamkulam, seeking to evict encroachers of forest land prior to January 1, 1977.

Earlier, the government had filed a counter affidavit, undertaking to evict the encroachers.

The petitioner complained that despite assurances given by the state, encroachment was continuing.

However, when the matter was taken up on Thursday, Additional Advocate General Rajan Joseph submitted that the state had taken a policy decision to evict all encroachers.

The government had earlier set apart about 70,000 acres of land to rehabilitate occupants of forest land prior to Jan 1, 1977. This was to prevent further encroachment in the forest land.

Central government sanction was also obtained for this assignment.

Later, a legislative committee, in its report, pointed out that thousands of hectares of forest land was still being occupied by the encroachers and only 1600 acres could be taken by the government from them, allegedly due to ''political interference''.

CPI(M) state secretary Pinarayi Vijayan told a meet-the-press programme here that traditional sectors, particularly cashew, textiles and coir, had collapsed.

""Chief Minister A K Antony is not developing the state, but taking it to backwardness"", Vijayan said.

Singh said that his government was committed to set up a corporation for purchasing quality drugs and material from standard firms.

21,"No row over sand mining project, says minister","THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Even as a section in the Congress is strongly against the mineral sand mining project along the Kerala coast, state industries minister P K Kunhalikutty on Friday defended the idea and said a controversy over it at this juncture was uncalled for as the final decision would depend on Central clearance.

The state cabinet had made it clear that the go-ahead for the project would be given only after obtaining the clearances from the Central mining, atomic energy and environmental ministries and after dispelling fears of all concerned, including the people along the coast, he said in a statement.

Besides, the UDF had decided to set up an expert committee to study the consequences of the project. Also, the final clearance would be subject to the verdict of the Kerala High Court, before which a case relating to mineral sand mining was pending, he said.

Kunhalikutty, however, said that the rare mineral wealth along the Kerala coast was as valuable a natural wealth to the state as oil to the Gulf countries. ""It is a question to be pondered over. What will be the industrial future of Kerala if we fail to utilise the abundant mineral wealth?"" he asked.

In a statement issued here, Badal said that the Congress agents tried to divide Punjabis to deflect attention of people from the disastrous performance of the government. He claimed that the Talhan residents had thrashed out a solution but the Congress leaders, including chief minister Amarinder Singh, saw it as ""missed opportunity and enacted the drama."" ""Amarinder was being advised by the same coterie that had played an active role during the days of militancy"", he alleged.

Badal questioned how Damdami Taksal spokesman Mohkam Singh, along with his supporters, could enter Talhan gurdwara while the entire village was turned into a cantonment. ""The entire saga is reminiscent of the Congress'' role in creating and sustaining symbols of militancy in early 1980s and 1990s,"" he said. ""The Congress is all set to recreate the Punjab tragedy through caste and communal violence,"" he alleged.

Claiming that the villages had reposed faith in Parkash Singh Badal and wanted him to be mediator, the Dalit leader said that his party supported the inclusion of Dalits in the management of the shrine. ""But Amarinder Singh considered it a personal insult if an amicable solution is found without the government''s intervention and hence he preempted it with all the force at his command,"" he added.
