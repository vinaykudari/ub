0,Hazare’s counsel alleges minister heaped abuse,"PUNE: The P.B. Sawant commission, hearing social activist Anna Hazareâ€™s allegations of irregularities by four ministers in the state, took a dramatic turn on Tuesday with accusations that state irrigation minister Padamsinh Patil had threatened and abused Hazare and his advocate after adjournment of hearings on Monday.

An affidavit to this effect was filed by Hazareâ€™s advocate, Arjun Patil, before the commission on Tuesday.

Arjun also submitted a letter written by him to Hazare, in which he has alleged that Padamsinh and other politicians were trying to take over his farm land in Mugali village, Solapur district, with an intent to pressurise him. Sugar commissioner Bijay Kumar had broken down before the commission on February 3 while narrating how Padamsinh spoke to him in an aggressive and impolite manner for daring to start an inquiry against him.

However, Padamsinh has denied both the charges. He told TNN he spoke for barely five minutes with Arjun after Mondayâ€™s adjournment and denied he ever used abusive language. â€œI only asked him in a lighter vein how long this thing would continue, to which he (Arjun) replied with a smile that it would take many days,â€� Padamsinh stated.

â€œIf I had used abusive or threatening words, why didnâ€™t the advocate take up the matter with the commission yesterday itself ? There was a police official present at the commission and the advocate could have registered a complaint with the commissionâ€™s counsel as well,â€� he stated, adding that he was exploring all legal options, including a defamation case.

Hazareâ€™s advocate claimed that after he handed over the contempt petition to the ministerâ€™s lawyer, Padamsinh confronted him outside the commission, saying that both he (Arjun) and Hazare were â€œharamkhorâ€� (rascals).

â€œI was shocked and asked the minister again what was happening, and he repeated his abuses. I could not believe that a minister could utter these words to a counsel and asked him a third time what was happening,â€� the advocate stated in the affidavit.

â€œI have not put down the words used by the minister against me, Hazare and Hazareâ€™s mother in the affidavit, but have jotted them down and can produce then before the commission if required,â€� Arjun added.

Hazareâ€™s advocate also submitted a letter to the commission, written by him to Hazare, in which he (Hazare) has alleged that Padamsinh and some politicians were trying to pressurise him by encroaching on Arjunâ€™s farm in Mugali.

He claimed that the district administration had â€œsuddenly decided to make a percolation tank on the landâ€� for which work on a permanent road passing through the farm has been stopped halfway.

Arjun stated that his brother, who jointly owns the land, objected to the development and sent a letter to the executive engineer of minor irrigation division on October 23, 2003. The executive engineer sent a reply on February 4, 2004, stating that the department would go ahead with construction of the percolation tank.

Padamsinh Patil denied any involvement in the matter. â€œThe construction of a percolation tank does not come under my department (irrigation) and it is done either by the zilla parishad or water conservation department,â€� he told TNN.

He said that he checked with Solapur MLA Siddharam Mhetre, who said that the district administration was making 200 percolation tanks in the area, for which permission had been obtained.

2,Advani takes eyeballs off Inzy-Sourav clash,"HYDERABAD: A man born in Sind rode a chariot into the heartland of Andhra Pradesh on Tuesday and took centrestage, beating the Pindi cricket fever.

Till L K Advaniâ€™s motorised rath hit Zaheerabad, it was Souravâ€™s cherry hunt that kept the reception party busy.A car radio kept up the tempo as it gave ball-by-ball details of the Pak runfest.

A small group of people stood around, ears on the commentary, eyes on the road waiting for the man from Sind. A small distance away, the state BJP brass, including Bangaru Laxman, waited under a tent for the Bharat Uday bandwagon to roll into AP.

The moment the chariot dawned on the horizon, the commentary was turned off, as if it was a forbidden thing to listen to a cricket broadcast. As Advani took his place to address the gathering, netaspeak drowned out the sweet sound of willow hitting cherry. Advani kept it crisp and dashed off to Zaheerabad, 20 km away. All along, he sat in the front seat waving to clumps of curious onlookers on the road.

At Zaheerabad, he pitched it right from the word go. Addressing a gathering of 2,000, he connected with the crowd that had sweated it out in the hot sun for well over two hours.

Cricket was forgotten as he began â€” apologetic that he couldnâ€™t speak the local tongue. ""Do you want someone to translate what I say? I have this nagging doubt that all of you may not understand Hindi."" A sea of hands waved to him in dissuasion.

With the transmission loud, clear and first-hand, Advani thanked people for the welcome, for the faith they had in NDAâ€™s governance, its development agenda and for turning out on a hot afternoon to hear him. He signed off with an appeal for votes for the NDA at the Centre and the TDP in the state.

At Sadashivpet and Sangareddy, things were much the same. By the time Advani reached the Patancheru area, daylight had faded. But unlike in cricket, bad light didnâ€™t stop play.

Here, the gathering, some mobilised and some voluntary, spent two hours watching the cricket contest on a TV set which was switched off as soon as Advani showed up. But that wasnâ€™t before some muted protests were heard after an announcement went out on the TV set being switched off.

The announcers, though, quickly threw in a promise of more action from the field of cricket once the leader finished his speech.

3,Parties clash over election graffiti,"KOLKATA: Tension simmered in north Kolkataâ€™s Jorasanko area on Wednesday afternoon following a clash over poll graffiti. A security guard was seriously injured in the incident.

The guard, who was allegedly attacked by Trinamul supporters, has been admitted to the Calcutta Medical College Hospital with multiple stab injuries. Police have lodged two complaints but have made just one arrest so far â€” a local Trinamul leader for inciting his supporters.

Trouble began when supporters of Mayor Subrata Mukherjee, the Trinamul Congress candidate for Kolkata North-West, faced resistance while writing on a freshly-painted wall on Munshi Saddruddin Lane.

A local hotel owner, Mohammed Sohrab, tried to prevent the Trinamul workers from writing on the wall, on which he had pasted ""stick no bills"" notices. The wall reportedly belongs to the erstwhile Rajendra Mullick family but Sohrab claims he has permission to maintain it.

Besides owning the Afreen Plaza Hotel near the wall, Sohrab also heads the Calcutta Fruitsâ€™ Merchant Association. The trader said an altercation followed when he tried to dissuade Trinamul workers, led by Sanjoy Sonkar, to write on the wall.

Soon a police team arrived from the Jorasanko police station and DC (Central) Rajiv Kumar and O-C Timir Bhattacharya tried to pacify the angry activists.

Trimanul Youth Congress general secretary Swapan Burman joined them. According to police, Sonkar aggravated the situation by urging his leaders to send more men. As more Trinamul supporters arrived at the spot, they attacked a guard, Mohammed Imtiaz, with choppers.

CPM supporters gathered near Jorasanko police station as news of the attack spread. They pounced on Burman when he emerged out of the meeting and heckled him.

The CPM men moved away when the police threatened action. Two police complaints have been lodged.

4,SFI loses Presidency elections,"KOLKATA: It will be difficult for the ruling CPM to accept this defeat before the Lok Sabha polls. Its studentsâ€™ wing, the SFI, lost by three seats to the Independent Consolidation at a tense election to the Presidency College students union. Of the 67 seats, 35 have gone to the IC and its allies, while SFI could manage 32.

The class representatives were elected on Tuesday, forming the electoral college. The office-bearersâ€™ election will take place on Friday. Till then, tension is likely to prevail on the campus as both sides chalk out their strategies. The SFI ousted the IC in 2002, in an election where chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjeeâ€™s daughter Suchetana and CPM state secretary Anil Biswasâ€™ daughter Ajanta played an active role. Bagging the union of the stateâ€™s top college had added a feather to the SFIâ€™s cap.

This time, the SFI was on weaker grounds, though its leaders did not sound down and out. The organisationâ€™s state secretary Apurba Chatterjee was confident that ""the SFI will ultimately form the board"".

But the IC is taking no chances. ""We have taken written undertakings from the candidates that they will not cross over under any circumstances,"" said Medha Sarkar, a victorious IC candidate. The IC members, however, fear that they might be assaulted by the SFI and at least some of them might be unable to turn up for the â€˜boardâ€™ election. ""Threat calls have started coming. We have been told to keep away from the campus or else...,"" said IC spokesperson Banolata Lahiri. They complained that despite the defeat, SFI still took out a victory march during the day. ""Later, near the canteen they pushed and slapped some of our candidates without any reason. We fear bloodshed before the final election and have decided to ask for police protection,"" Lahiri said.

5,"Powell visit business as usual, polls apart","NEW DELHI: Five years ago, if an American secretary of state visited India bang in the middle of a general election, there would have been a furore.

Charges of â€˜â€˜interferenceâ€™â€™ and American influence-peddling would have flown thick and fast. There may even have been a couple of demonstrations.

That Colin Powellâ€™s visit has faced none is a measure of how far down the road the two countries have travelled.

The last time the US secretary of state came to India in July 2002 was to defuse a warlike situation in the subcontinent. Thus the visit had a â€˜â€˜Indo-Pakâ€™â€™ context. But the subtext of the current visit had been made amply clear in his remarks on Monday, en route to the region.

Powell has emphasised his business with India is positively benign â€” furthering what he terms â€˜â€˜Next Steps in Strategic Partnershipâ€™â€™ (NSSP) agreement, expanded bilateral cooperation in civilian nuclear activities, civilian space programmes and high technology trade â€” all of which indicates a healthy, if routine normality.

The situation on the border between India and Pakistan will be an important item in the agenda. Pakistani assurances that they would â€˜â€˜permanently cease infiltration activity across the Line of Controlâ€™â€™ were made to Powell during his visit to Islamabad in July 2002, and to his deputy Richard Armitage a few weeks earlier.

But the US secretary of state has made it clear that his real concerns lie in Pakistan. The first issue he said he would take up would be the need for greater military action along the border with Afghanistan.

The second is the continuing fallout of the AQ Khan affair. As Powell noted, â€˜â€˜I will be seeking to learn from President Musharraf, and the others I speak to, what else they may have learned about the network that I have not yet been made aware of through normal intelligence channels.â€™â€™

Powell and his team have been the key US managers for Pakistan. It may be recalled that in the wake of 9/11, it was Powell who picked up the phone and issued the now-famous ultimatum demanding that Pakistan break with its erstwhile protege, the Taliban government of Afghanist an.

The Secretary of State has also been the key pointman in dealing with the A Q Khan affair, and it is clear from his remarks that the last word has not been spoken about it yet.

6,Up against crime in politics,"PATNA: Bihar Election Watch (BEW) coordinator Parveen Amanullah appears to be up against politicians, especially those having criminal background, and red-tapism.

""The state election office says it does not recognise our organisation and even refuses to demonstrate electronic voting machine to people at our request,"" she maintained, swearing that she would not be demoralised.

Daughter of former MP Syed Shahabuddin and wife of a Bihar cadre IAS officer, Amanullah along with a group of citizens and NGOs is out to keep a close watch on the run-up to Lok Sabha polls. She has been addressing groups of people in suburban areas of Patna. ""People tell me that they are too afraid to go to polling booths because of the possibility of booth grabbing. I tell them to go in large groups and cast their votes in the morning,"" she remarked.

Her foremost task now is to make available to the people the track records of candidates filing their nomination papers for the Lok Sabha polls. ""According to the SC order in March 2003, any citizen is entitled to get a copy of the affidavits submitted with the nomination papers giving details of the candidates'' educational qualification, assets owned by them and their relatives, etc. But here we have been told to give an application for the forms,"" she said, adding that the process for getting information about candidates has been made complex.

BEW hopes to look into the documents filed by candidates and come out with details of their assets as well as their criminal records. It has already issued an appeal to major political parties not to field candidates having criminal background. ""The system has been spoilt during the last five decades because citizens have withdrawn themselves. I want this to be a movement so that it can create a better atmosphere tomorrow,"" Amanullah said. BEW has sought appointment from leaders to put forward its agenda.

One of Amanullah''s plans for this election is to select six constituencies and hold ""Janata Ki Adalat"" (people''s court) making all the candidates to appear before the people and answer their questions. The constituencies being selected are Siwan, Balia, Purnia and others where mafia dons would be trying their luck.Up against crime in politics
