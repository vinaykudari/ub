1,"Lift blockades, minister asks farmers","CHANDIGARH: Haryana finance minister Sampat Singh said the BKU should reciprocate the state governmentâ€™s gesture of withdrawing cases against its leaders by lifting blockades to relieve the hardship being suffered by the common man.

He said in a statement here that there were certain areas of agreement in his talks with the BKU and the state government was in favour of continuing the talks.

The minister said the government can give a job to one person from the family of those killed and can also help them in other ways. â€œThe government is working in favour of the farmers and it has no problem in accepting their legitimate demands but complete waiver of electricity arrears is not possibleâ€� he said.

â€œNeither is this feasible for the state government nor is it in the interest of the state,â€� he added.

Singh said the situation in Punjab which arose due to complete waiver of power dues is there for every one to see.

During talks with leaders of the BKU, they (the leaders) had admitted that during the state assembly elections held during February 2000 the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) had made no promise of providing free electricity to farmers.

â€œBKU leaders are themselves aware of the ground realities and they should not insist on complete waiver of power dues,â€� he said.

Meanwhile, members of Parliament (MPs) from Haryana, Dr Sushil Indora, Capt Inder Singh and Surinder Singh Barwala have strongly criticised the incident of cutting of the 400 KV electricity line of the Bhakra Beas Management Board (BBMB) near Hansi by certain â€œanti-socialâ€� elements, who they alleged have been instigated by the Congress party.

They pointed out that the main intention of the Congress leaders behind this act was to malign the image of the state government and to create hurdles in the â€˜smoothâ€™ discussions taking place between the agitating farmers and the government.

2,Mafatlal to dereserve govt plot,"MUMBAI: The controversy over the state governmentâ€™s decision to return to Mafatlal Industries Ltd 15 acres of land reserved to extend the Byculla zoo has taken a new twist.

It has now come to light that this land does not belong to Mafatlal Industries. It actually belongs to the state government, which had given the plot to the company on a 99-year lease to build a cotton mill. It is learnt that the mill lease expires within a decade. The mill was declared sick two years ago and the workers retrenched.

The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) had reserved the plot more than two decades ago to expand its 48-acre Veer Jijamata Udyan zoo. Last year,members of the civic improvements committee, who inspected the mill land, were told that it would cost the BMC Rs 252 crore to acquire the plot at market rate.

Now, civic sources said that because Mafatlal was only a tenant, the BMC could not be forced to pay the market rate to acquire the land. Sources said the government should allow the lease to expire and then allot the land to the BMC at a nominal price to expand the zoo.

However, state urban development secretary Ramanand Tiwari said Mafatlal must be compensated at the market rate if the BMC wants to acquire the land. The Mafatlal management has submitted a detailed proposal to the government seeking to revive partly its cotton mill and pay its dues.

A senior Mafatlal official said the management would not like to comment on the issue at this stage. However, he denied suggestions that the company had plans to use the premises of the sick mill to start an entertainment complex and commercially exploit the land.

The state government seems to be convinced by the Mafatlal proposal to revive the sick mill and wants the zoo reservation to be deleted. Last month, the state government invited objections and suggestions from the public on its decision to dereserve the plot. The deadline for objections was June 15.

Chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukhâ€™s office has already received a host of protest letters from both citybased environmental groups and individuals like veteran Shiv Sainik Vilas Avachat, asking him not to give away the reserved land. They say that the congested city desperately requires open spaces.

3,Concern over political murders in state,"PATNA: Congress leader and chairman of the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India Ajit Kumar Singh has expressed his deep concern over rise in the murder of political leaders and social activists in Bihar as well as failure of the RJD-Congress government here in arresting and punishing the culprits.

Citing the instances of the murder of Congress leader Thakur Ramdular Singh in Buxar and recovery of the body of another party leader Bindeshwari Singh from near the Dehri-on-Sone railway station, he said that no concrete steps have been taken by the state government to arrest their killers, nor have financial help and job given to one of the dependents of the deceased.

No official of the state administration even felt the need to meet the bereaved families despite the fact that Congress is a partner in the state government, he added.

In letters sent to AICC president Sonia Gandhi as well as party general secretary and in charge of Bihar affairs Oscar Fernandes, he apprised them how party workers were being ignored in the state. Nor were they being given due respect, he added.

He demanded immediate curb on murders of political leaders and social activists, adding that proper compensation be given to the bereaved families.

CBI probe demanded: Congress on Saturday demanded a CBI probe into the Sheikhpura massacre of nine RJD activists in December last year and alleged that its senior leader and Lok Sabha MP Rajo Singh and his MLA son, Sanjay, who were among the accused, had been victimised.

In a letter to the chief minister, BPCC president Shakeel Ahmed and Congress legislature party leader Vijay Shanker Dubey, said Rajo Singh, released from jail in the case on bail on June 3, and his son, now in Sheikhpura jail, had no faith in the Sheikhpura administration and therefore a CBI inquiry was necessary.

They said that they would appreciate a judicial inquiry if the state government did not wish to hand over the case relating to the killing of nine RJD activists, including district president Kashinath Yadav at Tatipul in Sheikhpura.

4,Advocates expect delay in riot cases,"AHMEDABAD: With hundreds of riot-related cases piling up, organisations trying to provide legal aid to victims are convinced it will be years before justice is done.

Iqbal Sheikh, an advocate with the Jamat-e-Ulema Hind, explained, ""There are quite a few loopholes in the legal procedure. For instance, joint FIRs are being registered, where accused are both Hindus and Muslims, and they''re booked as part of the same mob.

He pointed out that in many cases about 40 to 50 persons had been booked for the same crime. Out of these, if even one of the suspects is not present for the hearing, there may be an adjournment.

He suggested that in such cases the prosecutor could separate the cases and try the case with the accused present.

A volunteer with the legal cell of city-based Citizen''s Initiative said that the problem was not just the legal procedure but also the way in which the FIRs, chargesheets and statements were recorded.

Currently, these critical legal documents are filed in such a way that it is very easy for the accused to escape. ""If the chargesheet does not name the principal accused owing to his or her political affiliations, then the case would not go much further.""

Shamsuddin Pirzada, a retired judge, felt that special courts and prosecutors had a role to play considering that the prosecutors who were now handling the riot cases were chosen as per the recommendations of the ruling party in the state.

""Not only are these prosecutors hand-picked, they are also raw with little experience in handling complex cases,"" he said.

He pointed that if the government wanted, it could easily set up special courts and appoint impartial prosecutors, as in the Godhra case. A panel of six to seven prosecutors has been appointed to handle the Godhra case, where the main prosecutor is being paid special remuneration which is twice the normal rate.

Echoes A S Saiyed, an advocate, ""these riot cases in the normal course would take anything between five to seven years to get cleared. So the best option is to treat these cases exclusively through the special courts suggested by the National Human Rights Commission.""

5,Man arrested for raping girl,"PUNE: The Pimpri police have arrested a 30-year-old man for allegedly raping a minor girl who, fearing ignominy, set herself aflame later.

According to the police, the accused Nagesh Manjalkar, a labourer staying in the Indira nagar slum in Chinchwad area, dragged Anita (14) into his house and raped her on the afternoon of June 4. The girlâ€™s nine-yearold cousin saw her being raped by Manjalkar.

Fearing that her cousin might go and tell his father about the incident, the girl set herself ablaze on the evening of June 4 to avoid embarrassment. She was rushed to the Yeshwantrao Chavan hospital with 25 per cent burns. Later she was moved to the Sassoon hospital where she succumbed to the burns on June 11.

The main complainant in the case, Parshuram Dangde, Anitaâ€™s uncle, was also a casual labourer. The girl was staying with Dangde for a long time. The police have arrested Manjalkar under section 376 and 306 of the IPC.

6,No end to woes of riot hit students,"RADHA SHARMA

AHMEDABAD: Their pursuit of the board exam from the Shah-e-Alam relief camp, despite personal tragedies and the exam-boycott call, had hit headlines.

Treated as special cases, escorts were arranged by the government to ensure their safe transit to exam centres.

But eight of them got a jolt when the Gujarat Secondary Education Board (GSEB) declared them failed for being absent!

The irony is not lost on these students who were appreciated for their courage and commitment as they wrote board exam when most others boycotted it.

""The purpose of our writing the first exams and not supplementary exams stands defeated. We might as well have opted for the supplementary exams"", fumed Sheikh Vasimuddin Azizuddin, of commerce stream.

Sheikh had lost his home at Naroda-Patia and was taking shelter at Shah-e-Alam camp. Though his peers advised him otherwise, he was adamant to write the exams on April 18.

""I did not want my career to suffer. But all my efforts have gone awry due to the board authorities'' callousness. I will not get admission in college this time"", says Vasimuddin.

Rathod Rehmat Samsuddin and his six friends who waited with bated breath for the class X results on Friday also got a similar shock. They were deemed fail for being absent!

""We were looking forward to join school at the earliest to provide some change. But now all the time will be wasted in doing paper-work to set things right"", says Rathod.

""It is shocking how the board can be so callous. They had gone overboard in mobilising these students to appear for the exams. Couldn''t they have exercised the same care to ensure that results were not messed up?"" asked co-ordinator of Shah Alam camp Mohsin Kadri.

He conceded that letters have been written to the DEO as well as the board authorities urging them to correct the mistake.

""Camp students being declared absent has been brought to our notice. It is very unfortunate and the board will rectify the error"", said GSEB examination controller H Hingu.

7,Ray of hope for riot orphaned,"VADODARA: There is a ray of hope for children orphaned due to communal violence in Vadodara city and district.

The National Foundation for Communal Harmony (NFCH) recently sent the first instalment of aid for the education of these children.

The foundation has identified 16 children in the city and district who have lost their parents in the recent spell of communal riots. The foundation has been set up by the Union home ministry to work towards communal harmony.

Resident deputy collector D R Shah said that the NFCH team had visited Vadodara in May. ""The three-member team met the children and collected extensive details on them. Their guardians will now be paid a sum every year to take care of their education,"" Shah said.

The foundation has decided to provide a sum of Rs 6,000 per annum to each child orphaned in the riots. The sum will be provided to them till they complete their school education.

Shah said that the sum has come as a great relief to the victims as it has arrived just before the academic session in schools here begins and has been disbursed promptly.

The amount shall be made available to the guardians of the riot-affected students at the beginning of every academic year. Similar arrangements, Shah said, have been made for children in other riot-affected districts of the state.

11,Farmers defy govt's early paddy plan,"JALANDHAR: The governmentâ€™s action plan on the agriculture front aimed at discouraging early sowing of paddy to save power and conserve water resources and to improve quality of produce to meet the WTO challenge appears to have backfired as a large number of farmers used generators and diesel pumps to start the sowing of paddy in defiance of the plan.

The action plan was to cut the supply of power in the whole of May up to mid-June to a mere two to three hours and also to delay releasing of water in the canals.

Also, a large number of farmers who went in for diversification in response to the call given by experts and the government did not get the required amount of water for the new crops and so had to plough them back into the soil.

The government has mismanaged the entire experiment, farmersâ€™ leaders have alleged, leaving the farmers confused and lacking in confidence to take another risk.

â€˜â€˜This time after the harvesting of wheat thousands of farmers went in for crop diversification and sowed sunflower, maize, fodder, sugarcaneand vegetables. However, when they saw electricity supply being cut to just about two hours daily they panicked and most of them have ploughed back their crops into the soil.â€™â€™

This is nothing but mismanagement by the electricity board, which didnâ€™t even bother to inform the farmers who were going in for diversification. Now their crops had been ruined.

â€˜â€˜We are going to start an agitation against the PSEB authorities. Even today the supply has been been less than eight hours,â€™â€™ said Hardev Singh Sandhu, president Kirti Kisan Union.

â€˜â€˜The aim of the action plan was prevent farmers from early sowing of paddy as it resulted in poor quality produce and wastage of power and natural water reserves,â€™â€™ he added.

A number of farmers in the Malwa region who had planned to revert back to the cotton crop were also dissapointed as they could not sow their cotton in time.

According to experts such cotton was always vulnerable to disease. Talking to TNN over telephone, Dhana Singh of Bhattiwal village in Sangrur district said, â€˜â€˜As water was not released in the canals and power reduced to just about two hours daily the cotton crop we had planned this time in place of paddy will not grow well. The yield will also be affected.â€™â€™

Even in Malout region known to be the cotton belt, the same problem has been reported, said Sandhu. Iqbal Singh Chatha,who planted sunflower and melons in 20 acres each, had to plough back the sunflower due to the drastic cut in electricity.

Also the melon crop which used to be lifted by traders in Jammu region could not be lifted due to war preparations on the front. There has to be a well planned strategy synchronising the power sector, the farmer and marketing of the product,â€™â€™ says Sandhu. All the farmers talked to were unanimous on this point, otherwise such experiments could lead to their ruin as they had already landed deeper into debt.

12,Disinvestment road littered with pitfalls,"CHANDIGARH: The recent submission of the report of the Punjab disinvestment commission to the state government has evoked mixed reactions on its recommendations with some arguing that the process was long overdue and some others saying that the state is abdicating its â€˜â€˜social responsibilities.â€™â€™

What is the truth? Probably somewhere in the middle of the two positions. On one hand the state government has very little resources to pay its employees and those of the boards/corporations (who consider themselves â€˜â€˜government employeesâ€™â€™) and as a result has no resources to refurbish the PSUs under it.

Its role in their functioning has become one of providing money or of taking it back (where boards/corporations have any).

On the other hand it is equally true that maintaining existing infrastructure in many PSUs is of importance to the economy of the state: undertakings like PAIC, PSWC, PUNSUP and MARKFED are the mainstays of the stateâ€™s agricultural economy.

They procure and process much of what the farmers in the state produce and if they are to be wound up (as has been recommended in the case of PIAC and PUNSUP) then the burden on the other agencies will be very heavy.

So far these are recommendations only and the state government with pitfalls has not formulated any alternative plan to take care of the burden which will fall on other corporations but it is clear that if the recommendations with respect to agriculture-related PSUs are carried out then large-scale restructuring of the stateâ€™s economy is inevitable.

Two events may make this process inevitable: One, the elections are over and for quite sometime the Congress government may not feel the heat on the political front due to these changes.

Two, there has been growing pressure over the last two years from the Centre to decentralise procurement which in effect means the state government bears financial cost of procuring grains, something that any state government is loath to admit in public.

The winding up of the PSUs associated with agriculture will fit into this scheme of things.

A communication strategy which allays the fears of the people who will be affected by the changes and preparing for alternatives to help these people is something that the government has to look into seriously.

In this a new challenge has emerged for the government: On one hand if and when decentralisation of procurement takes place the government will have to placate farmers and on the other it will have to face the employees who may lose their jobs.

13,"Farmers, Haryana govt talks today","CHANDIGARH: The second round of talks between the Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU), which is spearheading farmersâ€™ agitation, and the Haryana government, will be held on Monday in Jind.

While the government side will be headed by finance minister Sampat Singh, who is also the chairman of the four-member committee constituted by Haryana chief minister Om Prakash Chautala for the purpose, the BKU will be represented by its supremo Ghasi Ram Nain.

The first round of talks was held on Friday following the withdrawal of cases against BKU activists. Though this round did not achieve much in terms of the withdrawal of the agitation by farmers, it at least paved the way for the second round as both the sides had agreed to continue continue the dialogue without further complicating the issues.

As such, the BKU on Sunday deferred its decision to intensify its agitation in the light its 72-hour ultimatum, the deadline of which was Sunday morning. The government is likely to offer some concessions at the second round of talks with the agitating farmers, said reliable sources.

It may agree to withdraw power theft cases in case of those who agree to clear 25 per cent of their power arrears under the new arrears recovery scheme launched by the chief minister recently.

The BKU has been demanding complete waiving off of arrears and the government side rejected this demand at the first round of talks.

The government also turned down the BKU demand for a compensation of Rs 10 lakhs each to the families of those killed in police firing and the related incidents during the agitation. It is learnt that in place of the government, the ruling Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) is ready to give some financial assistance to the families of the deceased.

At the first round of talks, the government had agreed to give job to one of the members of the families the deceased. The Congress has already paid Rs 1 lakh as compensation to the families of those killed in police firing and the related incidents during the agitation.

Asked if the absence of chief minister Chautala, who on Friday left on foreign tour, would in any way delay the final outcome of talks, Nain said he should not have left the state like this, but it was his representativesâ€™ headache to decide what they could offer to end the agitation.

Defending his demand for a compensation of Rs 10 lakhs to the families of those killed in police firing, Nain said the government must not forget that the deceased were the breadwinners their families which were now left with no financial support.
