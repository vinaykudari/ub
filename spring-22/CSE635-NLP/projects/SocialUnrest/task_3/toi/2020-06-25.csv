0,EOU owner arrested,"AHMEDABAD: The Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) arrested the owner of a Surat-based exportoriented unit on Tuesday for customs duty evasion to the tune of nearly Rs 1.67 crore.

The accused, Chandraprakash Zaria ran an EOU under the banner of â€˜Tahira Internationalâ€™ whose factory was shown as based in Surat.

But the DRI found the unit did not exist and yet Zaria had obtained an advanced licence for customs duty exemption under which the firm imported yarn and sold the stuff in the local market.

Incidentally, Zaria is also the chairman of the Financial Credit Co-operative Bank in Surat, and is a chartered accountant by profession.

Zaria has been an income-tax consultant for the last several years in Surat and was booked for customs duty evasion on April 1, 2003.

However, since then he had been evading arrest by filing petitions in the lower courts and in the Gujarat High Court. Later he surrendered before the chief judicial magistrate on May 27, and also went to judicial custody, after which he was bailed out and then he absconded.

On Tuesday, he was formally arrested in Ahmedabad. According to sources, Zaria had bought the â€œTahira Internationalâ€� banner from someone in Kolkata and had been running it for two years.

1,Police open fire on farmers in Chevella,"HYDERABAD: Police opened fire on a group of farmers protesting at a police station in Chevella town on Wednesday, resulting in a person sustaining bullet injuries. The state government has ordered a magisterial inquiry into the incident.

Trouble started when over 500 farmers who had gathered at the local marketyard grew restive because the agriculture department could not supply them maize seed on time. The department opened only one counter and started dispensing seeds, but the farmers, who had been standing in queues since morning, turned restless.

Sensing trouble, a constable tried to impose order by wielding his baton. In the melee, a farmer, Mallesh, suffered bleeding injuries on the head and collapsed. The enraged farmers turned their ire on the constable. Chased by the mob, the policeman ran into the police station and locked himself in.

The mob reached the place and started pelting stones. Some policemen were reportedly injured in the stone throwing. With the situation going out of control, a sentry reportedly opened fire, injuring farmer Yellaiah in the abdomen. Yellaiah and Mallesh were rushed to Osmania General Hospital where the former was operated upon. His condition was described as stable.

After the firing, police resorted to an indiscriminate lathi-charge. They reportedly chased people to a distance of over 2 km and did not spare even women and old people.

There was palpable tension in Chevella with Congress MLA P Sabita Indra Reddy sitting on a dharna at the police station demanding action against the policemen.

Home minister T Devender Goud visited the injured in the hospital and told reporters that additional DGP Umesh Kumar would probe the incident. Later, the chief minister ordered a magisterial inquiry.

3,All-party meet on women's bill likely: Speaker,"PUNE: In view of the long pending Womenâ€™s Reservation Bill, Lok Sabha Speaker Manohar Joshi is planning to convene an all-party meeting early next week in the capital to discuss the fate of the Bill.

Speaking to reporters in the city on Wednesday, Joshi said senior political leaders from all the parties were willing to discuss the Bill before the commencement of the monsoon session of Parliament.

Joshi said several suggestions were mooted regarding the reservation of seats for women. â€œSome Parliament members suggested that instead of 33 per cent seats, 20 per cent seats should be reserved for women. Another suggestion from the election commissioner was that the issue should be sorted out at the party level,â€� he said.

Joshi said that the parties had not ruled out a consensus on 33 per cent reservation for women.

â€œHowever, there has been a suggestion that the total strength of the Lok Sabha should be increased by an additional 154 seats. The additional 154 seats should be reserved for women,â€� he said.

Clarifying the accusations and rave reviews which his book, Speakerâ€™s Diary, attracted, Joshi said he had not violated any rules laid down by the Constitution by citing his experiences and perceptions in the book.

â€œIndia is a democratic country and every citizen has a right to freedom of speech and expression,â€� he said.

4,Judicial probe into police action on ex-LDF minister,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Kerala Chief Minister A K Antony on Wednesday informed the assembly that the government had decided to order a judicial inquiry into the March 17 police lathicharge on a group of CPI-M activists at Palakkad in which former Finance Minister T Sivadasa Menon was seriously injured.

The chief minister made this announcement while replying to the debate on the demands for administration of justice, police, jails and stationery and printing.

Antony said a retired judge would probe the circumstances that led to the police action on Menon and sought the co-operation of the Opposition in implementing government''s development programmes.

Police action took place when the CPI-M activists were holding district level rallies demanding a judicial inquiry into the police firing on tribals at Muthanga in which one policeman and a tribal were killed.

Referring to the May 2 Marad incident which claimed nine lives, he said stringent action would be taken against all those who were directly or indirectly involved in the incident.

Efforts were on to bring back normalcy in the area with the co-operation of all the religious, political and other groups, he said.

Later, the house passed the demands for grants totalling Rs.281.536 crore for 2003-04.

5,Mayawati to address dalit rally in Chandigarh,"CHANDIGARH: Bowing to the pressure from Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh his UP counterpart Mayawati has decided not to visit the state to address the Dalit rally protesting against alleged police excesses in Talhan village near Jalandhar city.

Instead she would address the rally in Chandigarh purportedly against the Amarinder government for not allowing the BSP to hold its rally in Jalandhar.

Senior BSP leader Narinder Kumar Kashyap, who is also an MLA from Uttar Pradesh, told mediapersons here on Wednesday that the Dalit rally proposed to be held on July 7 in Jalandhar would now be organised in Chandigarh on July 15.

Instead of â€˜â€˜dhikkar rallyâ€™â€™, which was scheduled to be held in Dana Mandi in Jalandhar, it would be â€˜â€˜swabhimaan rallyâ€™â€™ in Chandigarh to uphold the dignity of the Punjab Dalits.

Taking exception to Amarinderâ€™s reported refusal to let the BSP organise its rally in Jalandhar, Kashyap said it was â€˜â€˜undemocratic and unconstitutionalâ€™â€™ for the chief minister to deny the Dalits their right to protest peacefully.

He said the police perpetrated excesses on the Dalits in Talhan village to intimidate and subdue them.

He said it was unfortunate to have barred the BSP from holding its rally as the Jalandhar district administration had already granted its consent for it after studying the law and order situation at the ground-level.

â€˜â€˜If the district administration saw no threat in the rally, how could the chief minister whip up unfounded fears of law and order breaking down after Mayawatiâ€™s visitâ€™â€™, he added.

Kashyap, however, denied that the BSP had given in to pressure from the Punjab chief minister to shift its rally venue, and said that the party had revised its decision in the interest of the state. â€˜â€˜Now, we would be holding the protest rally right under the nose of the chief ministerâ€™â€™, he added.

The BSPâ€™s state leader, however, kept maintaining till Tuesday night that the rally would be held as scheduled.

6,Dhumal rally lathicharged,"SHIMLA: Police lathicharged a rally addressed by former chief minister of Himachal Pradesh and senior BJP leader Prem Kumar Dhumal at the Ridge Maidan, here, on Wednesday afternoon.

State BJP spokesman Ganesh Dutt Dhumal, mahila morcha president Indu Goswami and MLA Virendra Kumar were among those injured.

Dhumal was not injured in the lathicharge which, the BJP alleges, was unprovoked.

The rally was held to protest against the â€˜â€˜draconianâ€™â€™ polices of the Congress government in the state which completed 100 days on Wednesday.

BJP leaders and workers were rounded up and taken to the outskirts of the city before being let off. However, the protesters managed to stop at Tunnel 103 and block traffic for about half an hour.

Fourteen legislators of the party left the Vidhan Sabha where the budget session was on, after question hour, and went to the Ridge maidan, where other party leaders and workers were waiting for them.

Amongst those present were Dhumal, state BJP chief Jai Krishan Sharma, former ministers J P Nadda, Narendra Bragta and R D Kashyap and party legislators.

As party leaders were addressing the gathering, the police began lathicharging them without warning, claiming that the BJP was violating Section 144 which was in force at the maidan.

It was not clear who ordered the lathicharge. The Shimla police chief said there was none, only a â€˜â€˜minor scuffleâ€™â€™ between the police and BJP workers. Deputy commissioner SBKS Negi also denied the lathicharge.

Dhumal told newspersons that the police action was â€˜â€˜against all norms of democracy.â€™â€™ He said they were to call on the governor to hand over a memorandum to him against the state government after the meeting.

Alleging that the â€˜â€˜brutal lathichargeâ€™â€™ on peaceful demonstrators was â€˜â€˜an attack on democracy, he said that Virendra Kanwar was forcibly taken away by over a dozen policemen.

â€˜â€˜The incident reminds me of June 25, 1975, when besides Loknayak Jaiprakash Narain, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Lal Krishan Advani and a host of other leaders were forcibly taken to jail,â€™â€™ he added.

The DC claimed that some police personnel were injured when the BJP leaders â€˜â€˜incited party workers to attack the police, who were trying to round up the demonstrators and take them to the waiting vehicles.â€™â€™

He said that Nihal Chand, a constable who had been posted in the region, was seriously injured and he had been taken to hospital for medical treatment.

â€˜â€˜There was no intention to arrest any one, but as Section 144 was in force on the Ridge, we only wanted to remove them from thereâ€™â€™, he added.

Negi said cases had been registered against some BJP leaders and workers, but did not divulge names. The state unit of the BJP proposes to hold demonstrations till July 10 in different parts of the state.

7,Govt protests cancellation of incentives to Cochin port,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Kerala government has strongly protested the custom department''s notification cancelling incentives to goods exported through Cochin port.

Replying to a submission in the matter, Chief Minister A K Antony said it was a very serious matter and the government had already taken up the issue with the Union shipping and commerce ministers.

The Centre''s decision would not only affect the trade in Cochin port but would also adversely effect the economy of the state, he said.

He said the reason citied for issuing such an order was frequent strikes in Cochin port and wanted those indulging in strikes to refrain from that.

8,Kerala government's on-line lottery soon,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The Kerala government would shortly start its own lottery, finance minister K Sankaranarayanan told the Assembly on Wednesday.

The government would invite tenders from private parties for conducting the lottery business, he told the House during question hour. A revenue of Rs.100 crores was expected through this venture, he said.

The state would adopt applicable provisions to the state from the centre''s mid-term financial reforms.

State revenue minister K M Mani told the House that state would ask the Centre to write off the debt of farmers.

Answering questions during question hour, he said the state government''s debt relief measures have benefited many farmers in the state.

9,Punjab mulling Gaushala Development Board,"CHANDIGARH: The Punjab government is considering to constitute a Gaushala Development Board which would work for the improvement of gaushalas in the state.

Stating this here, animal husbandry minister Jagmohan Singh Kang said the government would do its best to help gaushalas get financial aid from the Centre.

He said that those running unregistered gaushalas should get these registered with the Animal Welfare Board of India so as to be eligible for grants from the Centre.

Earlier on Tuesday, Kang distributed cheques worth Rs 4 lakh among gaushalas. The grants-in-aid were distributed under the National Calamities Scheme.

Kang appealed to gaushalas to accommodate more animals so that the menace of stray cattle could be contained.

He asked NGOs and socio-religious organisations and clubs to help the gaushalas take care of stray cattle.

â€˜â€˜NRIs can play an important role by donating generously for this noble cause,â€™â€™ he observed.

The minister assured that government veterinary doctors would visit gaushalas at least once a week.

He, however, warned owners of domesticated cattle of strict action if their animals were found roaming on roads and streets.

10,CM wants rally ban on busy roads,"KOLKATA: The government will no longer allow rallies and processions on busy roads in Kolkata. Meetings will have to be held at alternative venues like the Brigade Parade Ground and the Shahid Minar Maidan.

Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, at a high-level meeting on Wednesday, asked the police and the civic authorities to ensure smooth movement for vehicles and pedestrians, urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya said.

The Esplanade area is the worst-affected by rallies, the chief minister pointed out.

The urban development minister, however, did not specify whether political parties would be consulted for fixing an alternative venue for meetings.

The chief minister also instructed officials to strictly enforce the state governmentâ€™s earlier decision to ensure hawker-free zones. Food stalls must not be allowed in the business districts except between noon and 3 pm, he said.

The government had declared 21 streets as no-hawking zones, but the drive fizzled out with hawkers returning to occupy prime pavement space.

Now, the government will not allow hawkers to erect permanent or semipermanent structures.

To improve road safety, the chief minister has asked authorities to check speeding buses and â€œunhealthy competitionâ€� between drives.

The chief minister also wants an improvement in the traffic signalling system and said the bus terminuses at Esplanade and Babughat would have to be shifted.

The issue of frequent waterlogging in the city also figured in the discussions.

Bhattacharya asked the chief secretary to form a committee to co-ordinate the activities of various departments and agencies concerned with the problem.

To reduce air pollution, he said old and polluting vehicles must be removed from the city roads.

A master plan on utilisation of the space beneath the new flyovers had already been prepared, the urban development minister said.

11,IDRF donates Rs 1 lakh to govt scheme for girls,"HYDERABAD: The website of India Development and Relief Fund -- www.idrf.org-- was launched by chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu at his residence on Tuesday. On the occasion, India Development & Relief Fund donated Rs 1,10,000 towards the government scheme for providing bicycles to rural girls.

IDRF had recently ran into a controversy following allegations from several quarters that the organisation was collecting donations from non-resident Indians in United States of America for social work, but it is ''misusing'' the money for propagation of the Hindutva ideology.

Later, at a function organised to mark the launch of the website, official in charge of the IDRF operations in India,Vijay Mallampati, told The Times of India that the controversy has in fact ''increased the popularity'' of IDRF among the foreign donors.

Vijay said that IDRF will take part in the next meeting of Telugu Association of North America (Tana) and request the members to come forward with donations to improve the condition of the poor in India.

""The controversy erupted while the relief work was going on in Gujarat, so it is not actually proper to compare the inflow of funds as a measure of popularity. We have published a detailed response to the allegations against IDRF, called ''A factual report on IDRF'',"" he added.

12,Opp breather for govt on GO 610 report,"HYDERABAD: The all-party meeting convened by the Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS) on Wednesday to pressurise the government for the implementation of the interim report of the House Committee on GO 610, has decided to give â€œsome more timeâ€� to the administration to enforce the panelâ€™s recommendations.

Leaders of the TRS, Congress, CPI, CPM and the MIM held a two and half hour discussions on the issue. However, the TDP and the BJP did not attend the meeting.

Addressing a joint press conference after the meeting, TRS president K Chandrashekhar Rao, APCC president M Satyanarayana Rao, CPI state secretary Suravaram Sudhakar Reddy, CPM central committee member M Narsimha Reddy and MIM legislator Asaduddin Owaisi said that a unanimous decision was taken to give some more time to the government to implement the report as the House Committee chairman R Prakash Reddy convened a meeting on June 30.

The outcome of the meeting would be deliberated before chalking out future course of action, the opposition leaders said. Chandrashekhar Rao said that the members of the committee would elicit the home departmentâ€™s opinion on its constraints to implement the interim report.

He said the meeting was held to remind the chief minister of his assurance in the Assembly that the House Committee report would be honoured. The TRS chief said, â€œIf Chandrababu Naidu disregards the recommendations, then we will be forced to launch an agitation.â€� Terming the meeting as the first warning to the government, Satyanarayana Rao said that the chief minister had to face serious consequences, if he ignores the panelâ€™s recommendations.

â€œThe BJP also holds similar view on the interim report, but it did not attend the meeting because of political compulsions,â€� the PCC chief added. Congress MLAs P Goverdhan Reddy, G Chinna Reddy, D Sridhar Babu and A Indrakaran Reddy, former MLA M Kodanda Reddy, CPM leader S Malla Reddy and several TRS leaders attended the meeting.

The sudden announcement by R Prakash Reddy, chairman of the House Committee on GO 610, that the panel would meet on June 30, has forced the all-party meeting to refrain from chalking out an agitation on the issue. The parties, which attended the meeting, felt that the TDP would charge them with politicising the issue even after a meeting of the panel had been called for.

The TRS leaders reportedly mooted the idea of seeking President Abdul Kalam and governor S S Barnalaâ€™s intervention. The CPM reportedly disagreed with the idea as it has to seek the approval of its state committee before supporting the move.

13,Students protest for text-books,"HYDERABAD: Lower and upper primary students from local government schools, led by Students Federation of India (SFI) representatives held a dharna at the main gate of the department of school education on Tuesday, demanding that authorities print and distribute the remaining quota of 4.14 crore text books to all schools in the state.

As on date the government has printed and distributed 4 crore text books that are to be given free to all students up to Class V and from Class VI onwards to certain reserved categories.

With government schools reopening on June 15, almost half the students in the state are attending schools without text books, Students Federation of India state secretary T Sagar said during the dharna.

Students in the government schools performed exceptionally well in examinations conducted during the last academic year and the non-availability of these text books will only discourage students from academics, Sagar added.

The SFI representatives also demanded that the posts lying vacant, which are to be filled through the district service examination, be filled up at least on a contract basis.

The other demands of the SFI representatives, contained in the memorandum submitted to Department of School Education director Manmohan Singh include release of contingency fund to schools, providing adequate teaching infrastructure and filling up of vacant watchman posts.

14,BJP assails govt in budget debate,"PATNA: The BJP lashed out at the state government on Wednesday as the debate on budget for the current financial year began in the Bihar legislative council during the post-lunch session. The Congress too criticised the government but in a different manner.

Initiating the debate, leader of the opposition in the House Ganga Prasad said the government must improve the law and order situation in the state in order to ensure its industrial growth. â€œBihar lacks the infrastructure like roads needed for attracting industrialists to invest their money in the state. Anti-social elements are playing havoc with the development schemes. The state government has no information about its own money.

The rising crime graph has badly affected the enthusiasm of agencies meant for undertaking development works in the state. The demand for extortion money from businessmen and contractors has also hampered the progress of the state,â€� he maintained.

He said it is the moral duty of the government to pave the way for the stateâ€™s development. The government must take the opposition into confidence. It would ensure adequate help from the Centre for the stateâ€™s development. â€œWe will co-operate with the government in the matter of development. But the budget proposals for the current financial year are not in the interest of common people,â€� Prasad observed.

Participating in the debate, Congress member Shivnandan Prasad Singh said there is no scope for improvement in the education system of the state in the budget. â€œA large number of posts of teachers are vacant in the primary, middle and secondary schools of the state. Instead of filling these vacancies, the state government is talking about the creation of â€˜extra postsâ€™ of teachers for a period of 11 months on the payment of Rs 1,500 a month each. This is an alarming indication about the fate of the stateâ€™s educational system,â€� Singh maintained.

He said the legislators should put forward constructive suggestions for the stateâ€™s development rather than indulging in the unnecessary criticism of the government. â€œThe government must pay attention to the poor health services available in the state. There is no proper arrangement at the primary health centres located in rural areas. The budget should be made in such a way as to improve such services,â€� he added. He appealed to the government to improve the drinking water facilities and irrigation system in Bihar. â€œBihar ki janata ne baadhya hokar pradushan se samjhauta kar liya hai,â€� he remarked.

Fund for cemetery boundary wall: The state government has provided Rs 7 lakh for the construction of a boundary wall around the graveyard, belonging to the Christian community, located in Sasaram town to the Rohtas district administration.

Replying to call attention motion of Arun Kumar (Congress), the state government gave this information to the members in the state legislative council on Wednesday. The government also made it clear that it would get the boundary wall constructed around all the graveyards in the state.

Replying to a calling attention motion of Ganga Prasad (BJP), deputy minister for urban development Udit Rai said that a sum of about Rs 23.70 lakh has been made available to the PMC by the state government, of which Rs 15 lakh is earmarked for improving the Bansghat crematorium and Rs 8 lakh for Gulbighatâ€™s.

But on the issue of the remaining seven electric crematoria which had been mentioned in the question, the minister preferred to keep mum, When the member insisted on a reply, the minister said that after improving the three electric crematoria, funds would be made available for others.

Ghoswari killings: Several opposition members rose in their seats in protest when in reply to a question of P K Sinha (Loktantrik Samata Party), panchayati raj minister Upendra Prasad Verma refused to consider the killing of six persons of a particular backward caste at Milko and Keoti villages of Ghoswari police station in Patna district on February 17 as a â€˜massacreâ€™ and a fit case for compensation to the bereaved families.

Mangal Talab: In reply to BJPâ€™s Birkeshwar Prasad Singhâ€™s question, deputy minister for urban development Udit Rai admitted in the Upper House that Mangal Talab Park and ground of Patna eastern area lacked proper maintenance.

He had, however, no information about encroachment on its land and that a liquor shop was running on the land. On the advice of chairman, he agreed to direct the Patna Municipal Corporation authorities to remove all encroachments from the land, including the liquor shop, and keep the area neat and clean.

18,Women with property 'less prone to violence',"NEW DELHI: Women owning property are less likely to encounter physical violence from their husbands or in-laws. This has been brought out in a study on the patterns of domestic violence in Kerala.

The study shows a clear link between the prevalence of abuse perpetrated against married women and ownership of property.

""Ownership of property by a woman reduces violence significantly. Even some access to an asset, land or house, dramatically reduces the risk of violence,"" maintains Pradeep Kumar Panda of the Centre for Development Studies, who conducted the study.

Emphasising that ownership of property by a woman has a strong negative effect on the violence suffered by them, the study points out 49 per cent of those who do not own property experienced physical violence and 84 per cent experienced psychological abuse. In contrast, those who own both land and house reported substantially less physical violence.

Panda goes on to state that ownership of property has many direct and indirect effects not only on the well-being of the woman but also on children, family and society. It improves her bargaining power within marriage and enhances her dignity and self-worth. These women also have an option to get out of a marriage, if need be, as they have a place to stay.

Given this link, the study argues that ""right to housing and right to property and inheritance"" are critical to the prevention of domestic violence and an important precondition to women''s empowerment.

The study may be confined to Kerala but the same argument can be applied elsewhere as well, says Anuradha Rajan of the International Centre for Research on Women (ICRW). She says when the ICRW conducted its surveys on domestic violence, it had asked women in West Bengal to identify one factor which would have helped them ward off violence. All of them said it was ownership of property.

The study on domestic violence brings out how Kerala presents a paradox. Its impressive human development indicators are held out as an example for other regions to emulate. It boasts of low infant mortality rates, a favourable sex ratio, high levels of literacy and a high level of health and nutritional status of women and children.

However, these achievements overshadow the fact that women''s participation in the labour force and decision-making are low and harassment of women and prevalence of domestic violence is high.

Panda''s study reveals that overall, 35.7 per cent of women reported experiencing physical violence at least once in their married life while 64.9 per cent encountered one form of psychological abuse in their married life. Both physical and psychological violence was higher in rural areas as compared to urban areas.

Women gave different reasons as the possible causes for or triggers of violence. These include not looking after children properly, not attending to household chores, not cooking properly and so on. One-fifth of the women attributed the violence to infidelity: husbands were involved with other women but the former accused them of being ""unfaithful"".

Seventy-nine per cent women reported that their husbands hit them because of the wife''s suspicion that the husband was involved with other women. Dissatisfaction over dowry and alcohol consumption are cited as other reasons for conflict.

19,'Seer's formula a suicide note for the BJP',"LUCKNOW: BJP could be using an unsuspecting Kanchi Shankaracharya Jayendra Saraswati as a convenient facade to placate its allies and please the public by a display of itâ€™s softened approach to Ayodyha imbroglio.

Dismissing the recent peace parleys between the seer and All-India Muslim Personal Law Board as mere â€˜public posturingâ€™ a top leader of the state BJP said that the party would brook no compromise on the contentious issue. There could be no other solution to Ayodhya acceptable to us but construction of the Ram Temple, said the senior leader on Thursday.

The seerâ€™s mission, in fact has made the cadre quite restless apart from ruffling the senior leaders. â€œBabar presented us with a poll plank in 1528 by constructing Babri Masjid, we would only be fools to let go of it on the eve of Parliament election,â€� declared one of them. â€œWe have lost much ground since post demolition Ram Wave days. Coalition with BSP has done the rest and soft peddling mandir could prove to be the last nail in the coffin of BJP in UP,â€� he added.

None who matters in BJP here wants the talks to succeed, said another leader, who hinted at a fool-proof game plan. Already, there are enough indications that the Muslim community is not very keen on an out-of-court government-sponsored settlement. â€œIf the talks fail, we can blame it on Muslim resistance and if it succeeds we will oppose it with all our might. Image building is fine but compromise formula do not helped fill up ballot boxes,â€� he concluded.

The NRIs funding agencies would also have a major say, said another leader. Ram temple means big funds flowing and anything less than that means our major sources drying up, he said, elaborating upon the money politics in Mandir Nirman.

Not surprisingly, the seers efforts have not found much favour in Ayodhya. out of the three important religious heads, two - the much vocal mahant of Digambar Akhada, Paramhans Ramchandra Das and the chief of Choti Chavani Nritya Gopal Das â€” have gone public with their protests. The former has sworn not to allow any construction within the vicinity of Panch Koshi Parikrama Marg and the latter is carrying out a concerted public campaign against the alleged â€œbuckling under Muslim pressureâ€�.

Both of them unitedly command greater following than the secular saints of Hanuman Gadhi who has welcomed hankaracharyas efforts. â€œWe have already brought the shilas and begun temporary temple construction. It is too late now to accept any formulas or plan,â€� said the leader who called Shankaracharyaâ€™s much discussed letter a suicide note for the BJP.

21,Kerala approves private funds in govt hospitals,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Kerala government has approved the policy of developing the basic infrastructure in its hospitals with private participation, Health Minister P Sankaran told the state Assembly on Thursday.

Replying to a calling attention motion by Mathai Chacko (CPI-M) in the Assembly, he said hospitals could not be developed without assistance from the private sector as the government was starved of funds.

Several schemes had been proposed by private sector to provide basic facilities and super-speciality treatment to poor patients in government hospitals, he said.

He said government had not taken any decision to lease out the proposed super-speciality wing at the Kozhikode Medical College Hospital (MCH) to a private firm. An MoU had been signed with a Sharjah-based company for setting up the super-speciality wing at a cost of Rs 20 crore.

Later replying to a submission, he said all the required medicines had been stocked in hospitals to tackle the spread of fever with the onset of monsoon.

22,"Oppn alleges `link between educational traders, govt'","THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Leader of the opposition in the Kerala assembly, V S Achuthanandan, on Thursday alleged that the link between the state government and ""traders of education"" had been exposed with the government fixing Rs 1.76 lakh as annual fee for students selected on merit in self-reliant colleges.

The college managements were also now free to fix the fee for the remaining 50 per cent students of the management quota. Wards of the common man could no longer think of studying in medical colleges even if they were selected on merit, he said, raising a submission in the assembly.

In his reply, Health Minister P Sankaran said the government''s stand that the fee prescribed for students in government medical colleges should also be applicable to merit students in self-reliant colleges, could not be implemented due to a Supreme Court verdict.

The government was seriously considering enacting a law to exert more control on self-reliant colleges, he said, and wanted the opposition to co-operate with such a legislation.

He said the current fee was fixed as per the recommendation of a panel led by Director of Medical Education which reported that colleges would have to spend Rs 1.6 lakh for a student per year. The fee was fixed at Rs 1.76 lakh after adding ""reasonable surplus"" of 10 per cent as directed by the Supreme Court.

Education Minister Nalakath Sooppy said government would hold talks with self-reliant medical college managements to explore the possibility of reducing the fee for merit students belonging to the low income group.
