1,Old vehicles may get lifeline from govt,"HYDERABAD: In a probable case of tough talk and little action, the state government is learnt to have to decided to go slow on its decision last Monday to ban nearly 3.5 lakh 15-year-old vehicles in Hyderabad.The announcement of the decision to cull old vehicles had run into widespread criticism. The decision to ban old vehicles came after nearly three years of keeping the issue on the back burner.Hyderabad is fast emerging as a highly-polluted city, next only to New Delhi, especially in terms of air quality.The fact that it will leave lakhs of people without personal transport appears to have sunk in much after the Cabinet made its announcement. That there is rank confusion in the government over the issue became apparent when chief minister Chandrababu Naidu subsequently said that one of the options that could be considered for letting old vehicles ply would be by allowing change of engines, which is illegal.A senior transport department official told The Times of India that there was no proposal before the government to allow engines to be replaced. This would require an amendment to the Motor Vehicles Act.Meanwhile, authoritative sources in the government said the cabinet decision was not only hasty but also illplanned.""In fact, nearly 25 per cent to 30 per cent of the 11 lakh vehicles in the city do not even have the mandatory pollution control certificates. There is no way the government can determine which vehicle is causing pollution and which is not, the sources said.The sources said that the government would do well to get accurate air quality data from its 21 pollution monitoring centres in various places in the city before it makes any move on taking old vehicles off the roads. ""There has been a deliberate attempt by authorities to show that the levels of sulphur dioxide nitrogen oxide emissions are lower than what they are by improper siting of the measuring equipment, the sources said adding that this was done to show that officials were working effectively and also to protect the image of the city as a destination for business, tourism and on other fronts.In fact, a private company that wanted to install pollution monitoring equipment at the busy Masab Tank junction, was forced to relocate it as pollution loads at that centre were very high, the sources said.""Only if the government is armed with such data can it hope to push the vehicle phase-out through. There are at present no plans for providing alternate fuels like LPG for owners of old vehicles. If LPG is allowed to be used as auto fuel, then this would create such a demand that domestic LPG supplies would be hit, one official said.Interestingly, such has been the impact of the Cabinet decision that the Telugu Desam Party is expected to include it in the agenda for discussion at the party's next executive meeting in the coming week.

4,H Huda arrested in Waqf scandal,"KOLKATA: The police on Saturday made the first arrest in the multi-crore West Bengal Waqf Board scam, 15 years after it came to light.

Deputy commissioner (detective department) Soumen Mitra confirmed that a former member of the board, 65-year-old Hamimul Huda, was arrested on the basis of a complaint lodged by the West Bengal minority development and welfare department.

Huda has been accused of building up huge properties in and around the city with misappropriated funds. He is also accused of nepotism and gross misuse of power. Investigators are looking into how Huda, a man of modest means from Siwan in Bihar , became so rich and powerful.

The scam came to light 15 years ago, when under pressure from the Opposition, the government ordered an enquiry.

â€œThe then judicial secretary P.K. Sengupta carried out an enquiry and the report was submitted.

But the Opposition kept boycotting Assembly sessions with the demand for a CBI enquiry,â€� former Waqf Board member Sultan Ahmed said.

In 1996 the government constituted a judicial commission comprising Justice Gitesh Ranjan Bhattacharjee.

The commission submitted its report on December 31, 2001. The report was forwarded to West Bengal minority development and welfare department.

A deputy secretary of the department formally lodged a complaint with the detective department.

State Qaumi Tanzim president Sultan Ahmed said the government has not made the report public.

The arrest is just the tip of an iceberg.

Nearly 160 prime properties in Kolkata and suburbs were leased out at rates much lower than the market price.

If the scam is investigated properly, many more will have to be arrested, he added.

5,Interpol aid sought for Masood Azhar's arrest,"NEW DELHI: The Delhi Police would soon move the Interpol for issuance of a ""Red Corner"" notice warrant against the Jaish-e-Mohammed Maulana chief Masood Azhar, his agents in India, Ghazi Baba and Tariq, all wanted in connection with hatching of a conspiracy for carrying out suicide attack on Parliament on December 13. ""We will be soon moving for issaunce of a Red Corner notice against the three accused though we clearly know that he (Azhar) is moving openly in Pakistan,"" Delhi Police Commissioner Ajai Raj Sharma said here. A Delhi court had in May declared the three- Masood Azhar, the outfits chief commander in Jammu and Kashmir Ghazi Baba alias Abu Jehadi and one Tariq Ahmed as proclaimed offenders. The accused had been chargesheeted for threatening the unity, integrity, security and sovergnity of the country by waging war against it and committing several other offences under Pota, IPC, Explosive Substance Act and Arms Act. However, Sharma said that securing a Red Corner warrant against the three was mere formality and there was very less even the Interpol could do until Pakistan extended co-operation in arresting them. ""Red Corner notice will be a big joke but, nevertheless, we will follow the procedure,"" the police chief said citing the example of late South African Captain Hansie Cronje where the Interpol could be of no help in bringing him to India.

6,Swami rules out NC demand for J&K autonomy,"NEW DELHI: Minister of State for Home I D Swami on Sunday categorically ruled out National Conference demand for granting any pre-1953 status to Jammu and Kashmir, but said it was not averse to any fresh proposal being mooted by the state government.

""Government is very clear that the pre-1953 autonomy status cannot be granted,"" Swami said here while reacting to the demand raised by Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Farooq Abdullah and his son Omar Abdullah.

""Jammu and Kashmir has a far greater autonomy as compared to other states and if anything more is needed to be done, the government will think over it,"" he said.

However, the statement from Swami was of less importance as National Conference has already stated to Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee that they were not reluctant on granting of pre-1953 status to the state.

The National Conference has already said that the contentious issue could be resolved by holding parleys between the state and the Centre.

8,"Don’t talk to press, govt tells doctors","NEW DELHI: In an effort to clamp down on the flow of information to newspersons, the Delhi state government has passed an order forbidding doctors of government hospitals from speaking to the press.

The order passed on June 7 was circulated to all heads of hospitals owned by the Delhi government. It reads: ""It has come to the notice of the chief secretary, government of NCT Delhi, that contrary to standing instructions some junior officers have been briefing the press that does not reflect the full factual position. Such activities are not desirable and create embarrassment for government and convey an impression which may not be well-founded.""

It said only the medical superintendents and in some cases, heads of departments could provide facts to the media. The order made clear that on policy matters, only the minister or the principal secretary (health) would speak.

Information is anyway not easy to come by in the hospitals run by Delhi government. There are no public relation officers in these establishments and patients are left to their own devices.

Senior doctors, including medical superintendents, are completely inaccessible. And the red tape is such that lower level staff takes advantage of hapless patients. Bribery thrives and so does a complete fiefdom of technicians and karamcharis.

City health minister A K Walia does not feel the June 7 order is unfair. He said: ""There is nothing new in this order. As per the existing rules, junior doctors are not supposed to speak to the press. We simply want to prevent wrong information from getting into the press.""

He reasoned of late a number of doctors were spreading rumours just to serve their vested interests. ""Sometimes doctors who fail in their duties try to pass the buck to others. We want to stop all this,"" he said.

On PROs, Walia said: ""This is a good idea. If not in all hospitals, we would try to bring them in in big ones such as Loknayak Jayaprakash Narayan, Guru Tegh Bahadur and Deen Dayal Upadhyay.""

9,Man held for blackmailing govt officials,"PATHANKOT: The police on Sunday arrested a member the flying squad of the Anti-Corruption Forum on the allegation of blackmailing government officials and extorting money from them.

The police said that the Anti-Corruption Forum did not have the sanction of the state government.

Yogesh Mahajan, who runs the operations of the forum from furnished office here, used to reportedly harass people threatening them to give him money or else he would complain to vigilance officials about their underhand dealings.

The police also recovered the receipt book from his possession as he would take the money from his victims and was in the habit of giving receipts to make his operations look authentic.

Some of the victims had raised the issue with chief minister Amarinder Singh during his recent visit here.

The chief minister had denied that the government had given sanction to the forum and had told mediapersons that he would look into the matter.

SHO D D Sharma said that Yogesh Mahajan would ring up innocent people, threaten them and extort hefty sums money from them.

Sharma said the recent inquiry conducted by the Gurdaspur ADC had indicted Yogesh for harassing government officials.

He said the police had booked Yogesh on complaints against him by PWD official Prem Lata, bank official Pradeep Kumar and a local physician. Yogesh also allegedly sought monthly payment of Rs 1,000 each from Pathankot-based revenue officials.

10,BJP to bank on clean image of CM in polls,"SHIMLA: Himachal Bhartiya Janata Party spokesman Ganesh Dutt on Sunday said that the state council of the party which met at Mandi recently had decided to make the clean image of chief minister P K Dhumal, the all-round development of the state during the tenure of the government and corruption during the previous Congress regime as the main issues during the assembly polls scheduled for March next year.

Talking to newspersons here, he said the partyâ€™s central leadership had formulated a programme to bring the party back to power in Himachal, which had been discussed at length at the state council meeting.

He said the state Congress leaders had been reiterating that they will make corruption an issue in the forthcoming elections, but â€œa case for illegal land possession has been registered against the CLP leader.â€�

Dutt said that 20 Congress MLAs had even signed a letter favouring the CLP leader, which only showed that they had sided with corruption.

He claimed that the matter had not been raked up by the BJP or any individual but had been brought up by the judiciary, and the government machinery had valued the land at Rs 200 crore, which only showed the misuse of power by the previous Congress government.

He advised the Congress leaders that they should take up the matter in the court rather than using the public to put pressure on the judiciary and the government officials, and apologise for their misdoings.

11,Low turnout marks Council polls,"PUNE: The elections to the graduate and teachersâ€™ constituency from Pune division were marred by low turnout on Sunday as authorities registered 40 per cent and 53 per cent voting for the two seats to the legislative council.

The elections for the graduatesâ€™ and teachersâ€™ constituency, spread over five districts, were held peacefully as voters exercised their franchise in 452 booths covering the division.

While there were ten candidates for the graduates constituency, the teachers segment had 15 candidates vying for the council seat.

There are 1,95,009 registered voters for the graduates constituency, while the teachersâ€™ constituency candidate would be selected by an electorate of 57,802.

In the finally tally for the graduates constituency, the polling in the Pune district was 30.82 per cent, Solapur 50 per cent, Kolhapur 40 per cent, Satara 31.53 per cent and Sangli 51 per cent.

Similarly, for the teachers constituency the polling was recorded at 45.83 per cent for Pune, 69 per cent for Solapur, 51 per cent for Kolhapur, 49 per cent for Satara and 54 per cent for Sangli.

The voting at Kolhapur district was quite low, especially in the Graduate constituency elections.

The turnout in Pune was nothing spectacular as only 12405 votes were polled in the graduates constituency despite having 53,838 eligible voters.

In Pune district, the highest turnout was in Haveli taluka as 5129 degree holders came out to record their choice for the legislative council candidate.

Thanks to arithmetic, the voting in Welhe taluka of Pune district was recorded at 54 per cent although only 65 people voted.

Election officials said the efforts of the district election machinery all over the division to register maximum voters went in vain because of the low turnout.

Worst, the rolls prepared this time are not valid for elections to the two constituencies next time around.

Meanwhile, political observers felt that less polling at Kolhapur meant a setback for Congress candidate Manik Patil Chuyekar as the district happens to be his bastion.

Chuyekar, a Kolhapur ZP member and secretary of the state youth congress, was banking on high polling from Kolhapur to cover up for the lack of popularity in Pune, Satara and Sangli.

Another candidate to be badly affected by the low turnout in Kolhapur district is Sunil Modi, a BJP rebel candidate.

While Modi was never a threat to the official candidate fielded by the BJP, large-scale voting in Kolhapur would have meant a reduction in the votes polled by Jawdekar.
