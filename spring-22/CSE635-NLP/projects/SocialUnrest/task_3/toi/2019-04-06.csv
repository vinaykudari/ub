0,Druggists protest sales tax hike,"bellary: the district chemists and druggists association said here on friday that if the government did not reduce the sales tax on certain medicines, they would launch an indefinite strike throughout the state in association with other units. b.k.prasannakumar, president, bellary unit, affiliated to the karnataka chemists and druggists association told reporters that the problem was serious in hyderabad-karnataka region as the districts are all on the border to neighbouring andhra pradesh where taxes on drugs are comparatively lower. prasannakumar said the proposed 12 per cent tax on pharmaceuticals in the state budget would have a bad effect, especially when it is lower in neighbouring states. he said the steep hike would result in loss of revenue and trade infiltration. the association urged chief minister krishna to consider medicinal and pharmaceutical preparations as life-saving items and reduce tax to 8 per cent. prasannakumar said members of association would wait another week for a response from the cm. meanwhile, as a token protest they will shut down medicinal outlets for one day, and the date will be decided soon.

3,DERC drafts rules to set up mini power plants,"new delhi: draft regulations for setting up captive power plants have been set up by the delhi electricity regulatory commission. this will enable the resident welfare associations, housing societies and corporates to set up an independent supply of power and not depend upon the delhi vidyut board for their personal use. in fact, delhi metro rail corporation has already sent in an informal request for setting up a mini power plant. at a press conference on friday, derc chairman vk sood said: â€˜â€˜the dmrc wants to set up a 12 mw power plant for their personal use. this proposal, though only 12 mw, is for setting up a huge power plant. similarly, an upmarket colony in south delhi has also planned to set up their own source of power.â€™â€™ according to sood, a cpp can be put up by anyone to meet his personal requirements. sood said: â€˜â€˜however, if a person is producing access power, we will allow the person to sell power to the dvb. but for this, the person will have to provide the infrastructure for the transmission and the inter-linking costs to the dvb and this will be guided by a tripartite agreement.â€™â€™ he said: â€˜â€˜but, one cannot put up any kind of cpp. expertise is required to run it. those who plan to set up a cpp over 25 mw, will have to seek prior permission from central electricity authority.â€™â€™ the dercâ€™s consent for a cpp will be valid for ten years. the existing cpp owners do not have to seek the permission of the derc right now.

4,New taxes upset govt’s priorities,"new delhi: a four per cent tax on cng and foodgrains, an eight per cent tax reduction on mobile phones: the delhi budget for 2002-2003 has thrown awry the city governmentâ€™s priorities. despite all the political tom-tomming on the governmentâ€™s commitment to popularise cng, the move to levy a four per cent sales tax has come as a disincentive for those converting their vehicles to the new-fuel mode. â€˜â€˜the move is regressive,â€™â€™ said jagdish mukhi, leader of opposition in the delhi assembly. mukhi, however, ignores the centreâ€™s decision to levy 90 paise exise duty on cng. â€˜â€˜even the centre could not avoid a tax hike on cng despite its commitment to promote this new fuel. sometimes one has to give in to financial pressures,â€™â€™ said city transport minister ajay maken. the opposition has dubbed the delhi budget as â€˜anti-poorâ€™. â€˜â€˜even items like processed grain, packed and branded pulses and cereals have not been spared from the higher tax net,â€™â€™ mukhi alleged. the government, however, justified the tax hike citing its dwinding revenues and the compulsion to rationalise taxes at par with other states in order to enforce the new value added tax regime in the next fiscal year. finance minister mahinder singh saathi said sales tax collection registered a fall due to reduction in the revenue coming from diesel and petrol. the government had failed to meet its sales tax targets in the last fiscal. it collected rs 3,691 crore as compared to the set target of rs 3,800 crore. â€˜â€˜we generate rs 300 crore annually from sales tax on diesel and petrol. as the public mode of transport has now shifted to cng, it is not economically feasible to continue tax exemption on cng,â€™â€™ he said. transport minister ajay maken claimed the tax hike was only nominal. â€˜â€˜there is just 51 paise hike on cng rates. it is not going to hurt anyone,â€™â€™ he said. the four per cent sales tax will not increase the state revenue substantially, but finance department officials claim the hike was necessary. â€˜â€˜uniformity in taxation has to be brought if we must bring in the value added tax regime from the next financial year. keeping this in view, we decided to impose sales tax on cng,â€™â€™ said ramesh chandra, principal secretary (finance). the tax reduction on mobile phones has also been justified on the same grounds. saathi said: â€˜â€˜we had been charging 12 per cent tax on mobile handsets which has been above the floor rate. when we turn to vat, this tax difference as compared to other states could create problems. the decision to bring it down in this budget has been with the view to rationalise it.â€™â€™ saathi added: â€˜â€˜there is a uniform tax of eight per cent on cng everywhere. yet as compared to other states, we have only imposed four per cent tax. cng is still the cheapest in delhi.â€™â€™ in the capital, cng is currently being sold at the rate of rs 13.31 per kilogram. after the imposition of four per cent tax, the price of the new fuel would now go up to rs 13.82 per kg.

6,Police don’t know the juvenile law,"new delhi: juvenile offenders are obviously not a priority with the police. despite a standing order that makes it mandatory for all shos to appoint a sub-inspector in each police station to deal with cases concerning child/juvenile offenders, most officials are not even aware of this requirement. an inspector posted in the south district expressed surprise when she was asked whether her station had a child officer. â€˜â€˜if a juvenile is accused of some crime, then normally a woman officer is deputed to question the offender,â€™â€™ she said. she added that the age of an offender is generally judged by his/her appearance. â€˜â€˜if the offender appears to be a minor then a woman takes over,â€™â€™ she said. but even in instances where there is a child officer â€” as was in the case of tughlak road police station where three juveniles were recently picked up from lodhi gardens for allegedly robbing a watch â€” the police may still go by appearances. a senior south district officer says this is mainly because there have been numerous instances in which majors have deliberately understated their age and tried to pass of as juveniles. â€˜â€˜in case of confusion, we have also taken the accused for age verification tests,â€™â€™ he said. the officer hastily added: â€˜â€˜whenever a juvenile is booked for an offence, no policeman of the rank lower than sub-inspector can deal with the case. if it is a non-cognizable offence then we usually let off the offender after bringing the matter to his parentsâ€™ notice.â€™â€™ confusion continues to shroud the word â€˜juvenileâ€™. the police are also not sure if the word refers to those under-18 or under-16 years of age. â€˜â€˜it is true that many officers still go by the old juvenile justice act which defined a juvenile offender as one being below 16 years of age. consequently, minors get booked as adult criminals,â€™â€™ said another officer.

7,Telenipara tense after violence near mosques,"kolkata: one person was killed and two seriously injured in violence around mosques at telenipara in hooghly on friday afternoon. local residents said that an ongoing gang war had turned into a communal flare-up through â€œmachinationsâ€� of some â€œbrainsâ€�. later, the police and the district administration claimed that the situation was under control but tense. district magistrate subrata biswas confirmed that a miscreant named raj kumar chowdhury, 30, died in hospital after being injured when a bomb exploded in his hands. eight others were hospitalised. while locals claimed that the police had opened fire, ig (law and order) chayan mukherjee denied it. â€œefr, special armed police and raf brought the situation under control. thirty persons were arrested, most of whom were outsiders,â€� biswas said. people, however, alleged that the arrests were â€œindiscriminateâ€�. the incidents took place in a mixed-community working-class area which has seen communal clashes earlier. residents complained that though sporadic incidents had been occurring since wednesday, the administration and leaders failed to take precautions. mla kamal mukherjee admitted that there was a war between two â€œrowdy groupsâ€�. according to locals, both the rival gangs â€” one led by mohan shaw and the other by md sabir alias bauna â€” had political backing. one dinesh gupta of shawâ€™s group sustained a bomb injury on april 1. on wednesday, bombs were hurled near a madrasah. groups of people from both communities gheraoed police outposts demanding protection. bombs were thrown around a mosque between gondalpara and malapara as friday prayers were about to begin. in a couple of other areas, too, brickbats and bombs were hurled around the same time. later, some arson was also reported. the police could only watch the situation spiral out of control. the dm, local citu leader md israel and human rights activist amitadyuti kumar agreed that the incidents showed signs of planning and instigation by outsiders. israel said that sensing trouble, local trade unions had called a meeting to diffuse tension at 5 pm on friday, but trouble broke out before that. the panic was palpable as mukherjee, congress mla of neighbouring champdani abdul mannan and cpm leaders like deb gopal chakraborty said the situation was too volatile for an immediate peace initiative. â€œwe have to face bombs if we venture out in the area now,â€� said mukherjee.

8,BJP allies unhappy over Gujarat riots,"new delhi: the bharatiya janata partyâ€™s allies in the national democratic alliance (nda) privately admit that the violence in gujarat has irretrievably damaged the national image, alienated many of them from their muslim constituency and resulted in a sharp drop in foreign investment in the country. earlier this week, when the andhra pradesh cabinet met in hyderabad, several ministers told chief minister chandrababu naidu it was time the telugu desam party consider severing its links with the bjp. tdp sources add that one of the reasons why naidu has not yet announced his choice for lok sabha speaker is that he is debating how much longer can he support the bjp without further damage to the tdp which has a large muslim constituency. they also add that naidu has spoken several times to the prime minister, asking him to take some action in gujarat. and yet, despite the disquiet among the allies â€” who were very vocal on the ayodhya issue and forced the bjp leadership to permit only a token shila pujan â€” they have been virtually silent on gujarat. according to nda sources, this is because, at the moment, the possibility of a political re-alignment at the centre is non-existent. many among them are opposed to joining hands with the congress and weary of facing a general election. but as samata sources pointed out, even that is something they may consider: â€˜â€˜we were waiting for the pm to visit gujarat. if the violence does not stop now and normalcy not restored, the nda will be forced to ask for a meeting and then there could be a showdown.â€™â€™ tdp spokesperson and rajya sabha mp c ramchandraiah, too, said, â€˜â€˜we are hoping the pmâ€™s visit will help to restore normalcy. the tdp has not said anything because as a regional party we donâ€™t feel it is proper to talk about the dismissal of the chief minister of a purely bjp state government.â€™â€™ samata spokesperson shambhu srivastava said,â€˜â€˜the comments of the nhrc should be taken seriously and its recommendations, especially about the setting up of special courts, should be accepted. the continuing violence demonstrates either insufficient administrative will or competence. either way it does not show modi in a good light.â€™â€™ if the nda allies think the pmâ€™s visit has chastised modi, they could be wrong. bjp spokesperson sunil shastri stressed on friday that the pmâ€™s comments did not mean he disapproved of modi. shastri, in fact, defended modiâ€™s administrative skills. rss sources pointed out that the pmâ€™s visiting godhra first before the rehabilitation camps set the tone for his visit. if modi, â€˜â€˜essentially a team personâ€™â€™, was removed, it would pit the bjp against the rss and vhp, they said.

9,PU development grants utilised after 4 years,"patna: patna university has utilisied the development grants sanctioned by the ugc during the ninth plan period well within the stipulated period. the plan period ended on march 31. the ugc had sanctioned a sum of rs. 1.35 crore for the construction of new buildings and completion of half-constructed buildings of the university. the money was lying unutilised for the last four and half years due to some procedural wrangles. the present vice-chancellor, k k jha, however, adopted fool-proof measures to utilise the development grants in a very short period. works for construction of quarters for teachers at rani ghat, one examination hall each at science college and b n college, and a three-storeyed annexe of the pu administrative building were taken up. similarly, works for completion of the incomplete girlsâ€™ hostel at krishna kunj near g d s girlsâ€™ hostel and half constructed academic council building at the patna college were also started well within the time. the ninth plan grants meant for purchase of books and equipment and publication of theses and research journals were also fully utilised by the university. now the university is eagerly waiting for the sanction of development grants for the 10th plan period. exam season: the long-awaited examination season of patna university commenced on friday as thousands of boys and girls of bachelor part i arts, science and commerce honours classes (2001-2002 session) took their examination in the first paper at different centres right from the patna womenâ€™s college to science college. the practical examinations of i.sc., m.sc. and m.a. students of pu have also started. refresher courses: for reasons best known to the authorities alone, the academic staff college (asc) of pu could conduct only three refresher courses out of 16 sanctioned to it by the ugc during the last financial year (2001-2002). ascâ€™s new director nawal kishore chaudhary has written to the ugc to allow it to conduct as many as 26 refresher courses, including the spill-overs.

10,National Insurance has maximum liability in riots,"ahmedabad: following a logic that no one seems to have understood as yet, value of claims in the smallest insurance company in the country have exceeded those of any of its much larger competitors in the recent communal riots in gujarat. despite being only the fourth largest insurance company in the country, the national insurance company ltd has received 1,205 claims worth a staggering rs 54 crore. in comparison, the new india assurance company, the largest in the business, has received only 1,058 claims worth rs 34 crore. the united india assurance company, on the other hand, has received the largest number of claims at 1,300 but they are worth only rs 40 crore. the oriental insurance company seems to have the least risk in the current riots considering that it received only 973 claims worth rs 29 crore. ""although this figure of rs 54 crore will come down once we start making assessments, we may still end up with the maximum risk insured in the recent riots,"" says regional manager of the national insurance company at ahmedabad r m kaul. ""there is no way that you can explain this phenomenon logically. it just happens that we are the worst hit,"" he said. with one of the worst riots taking place in ahmedabad, it is no surprise that almost 50 per cent of the rs 54 crore come from ahmedabad. interestingly, north gujarat comes in second with himmatnagar along with modasa accounting for rs 14 crore of the claims, while claims from mehsana are worth rs 2 crore. vadodara may be one of the worst-hit, but the company received claims worth rs 4 crore only. nadiad, on the other hand, took away rs 5 crore of the company''s claims cake with surat and bhavnagar claiming rs 1 crore each. as it happens in most riots, commercial establishments and small businesses like shops and restaurants have borne the brunt of miscreants running amok in the state after february 27. a large chunk of the minority-owned restaurants were insured by the company. as many as 38 of them were gutted in the initial days of the riots, but kaul maintains there was specific reason for them having the restaurants. ""it is just bad luck i suppose,"" he says. says manager at new india assurance company manoj shah, ""nearly 60 per cent of policies come from small businesses. as these riots have hit at the heart of our business, the next few months are going to be very hard for us. already, we are taking in very little new business, except renewing old policies. and now a large chunk of our premium is gone as well."" this is also reflected in the estimated loss that gujarat has suffered in the riots, according to the gujarat chamber of commerce and industry (gcci). in a note given to prime minister atal behari vajpayee, the state''s losses have been put at rs 10,938 crore, with the total loss to trade taking away the major chunk at rs 7,280 crore. ""more than the financial implications, the damage to the psyche of the small businessmen has been phenomenal,"" the note reads. ""businessmen like traders of provisions, vegetables, edible oil, milk have lost up to rs 55 crore.""

12,Youths' involvement in riots disturbs Uma,"ahmedabad: amid the prime minister''s hectic tour here on thursday, there was one saffron-clad vip moving along with vajpayee from one relief camp to another, and at times sitting on the stairs of the dais brooding over the plight of the refugees. union minister of state for sports, youth and cultural activities uma bharati was here because she had expressed a desire to join the delegation to understand what caused the gory communal violence in gujarat - a state she has been familiar with for past several years. ""i have been coming to ahmedabad to address religious gatherings ever since i was seven years old. i have found that gujaratis are tolerant and peace loving people. whatever has happened in godhra and afterwards in ahmedabad is shocking, unbelievable and mind boggling for me"", she said. ""a consensus is the need of the hour and it might lead to a better solution of the present crisis in gujarat. the removal of narendra modi is not the solution. on the contrary, it might add fuel to the fire"", she told tnn. uma bharati also put searching queries to the women in the vhp-run relief camp in kankaria, mainly to ascertain the factors that led to the communal flare-up in danilimda and behrampura, where hindus and muslims had lived together happily in the past. on returning to the circuit house annexe, uma bharati discussed the situation with bjp yuva morcha leaders and asked them to help the government in rehabilitation of the riot victims in ahmedabad and other parts of the state. while giving her reaction to communal disturbances, she said that she was shocked to learn about incidents of torching of human beings, never heard before in gujarat. it was really shocking, she said, and wondered why the hindu youths are still unrepentant after all this violence. religious leaders and social workers should take this development seriously and undertake an academic study to change the mind set of the youngsters, who have turned violent. there should be a debate on minoritism, secularism and on kafr. she said that after reaching new delhi, she would contemplate on what efforts her ministry can take to salvage the situation in gujarat.
