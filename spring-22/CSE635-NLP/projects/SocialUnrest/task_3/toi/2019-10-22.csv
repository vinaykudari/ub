0,40 arrested for Badlapur riot,"BADLAPUR. Thane : For the fourth time in eight months, a township of Thane district flared to a communal spark as widespread incidents of arson and stabbing left 10 people in Badlapur injured, two of them severely.

The violence followed an eve-teasing incident, the police said. A mob set afire a saw mill, a rice mill, several shops, two vehicles and some houses. The police fired four rounds in the air, but the situation was brought under control only by midnight. Additional police and fire brigade personnel have now been stationed in the township. This year already has seen communal disturbances in Murbad, Kalyan and Bhiwandi. Forty people have been arrested in connection with the Badlapur violence, said minister of state for home, Kripashankar Singh.

Among those arrested are two Bharatiya Janata Party corporatorsâ€”Sharad Mhatre and Sanjay Bhoirâ€”and a former corporator, Masood Kohari, officials said. However, Mr Singh refused to confirm this. Sources close to Mr Singh said his department was unhappy about the performance of police commissioner S.M. Shangari.

Several communal incidents have occured under his watch, as also the torching of the Singhania hospital by Shiv Sainiks last year. The police claimed an incident of eve-teasing had led to the violence but members of both communities insisted that the communal situation in Badlapur had been simmering even before Navratri. Sundayâ€™s skirmish between two groupswas enough to blow the lid off, they said. The Bajrang Dal has been active in the area for the past eight months. Violence over an alleged incident of eveteasing started around 8.30 p.m. on Sunday the old Badlapur town, the police said.

Singh and Mr Shangari refused to name people involved, arguing that this could aggravate the situation. Shiv Sena MP from Thane, Prakash Paranjpe, and Sena district chief, Raghunath More, who visited Badlapur on Monday, told Singh that a mob had used a toy gun to shoot ball-bearings at the police. Some local residents repeated these allegations to TNN. However, both Mr Shangari and Mr Singh refused to confirm this. The Sena leaders wanted the police to extensive combing operations for weapons. â€œWe donâ€™t mind, even if you search our temples, but the police must comb the entire township,â€™â€™ Mr More told a group of Sainiks. The old Badlapur town is eight kilometres from the railway station and has a population of about about 10,000 people. It does not a single police chowkey.

There is one shortstaffed police station some distance from railway station. Mr Singh promised to provide a chowkey the town and also increase the strength of police station. He said that certain elements were fanning communal fires in the state discredit the government. He also denied there had been an intelligence failure. Those injured are Milind Mule, Nandkumar Bhopi, Prashant Tawde, Hemant Bhopi, Nilesh Ganore, Subodh Sule, Tushar Jagtap, Shivaji Sonawale, Nathuram Padwal and Aslam Mohammed. Mr Padwal Mr Mohammed were on Monday shifted J.J. and Lokmanya Tilak hospitals in Mumbai and their condition was described critical.

1,Mumbai streets remain unswept as staffers attend rally for bonus,"MUMBAI: On Monday, 5,000 BMC and BEST employees did not report to work and instead attended a rally at Shivaji Park to press for their demand of Divali bonus. Though the meeting yielded little, the city was left with unswept streets and heaps of garbage piled up in several areas. BEST buses were pelted and their tyres deflated. BEST transport services, however, were not affected.

The BMC and BEST unions have threatened to launch an indefinite agitation after October 24 if their demand for bonus is not met. The Shiv Sena, which commands a majority in the BMC, too has come out in favour of payment of bonus. While BEST staff are likely to paralyse services from October 24, the BMC employees may strike work from October 28 onwards. Strongly criticising the civic unions for threatening to hold the city to ransom, Action for good Governance and Networking in India (AGNI) chairperson and former municipal commissioner B.G. Deshmukh said the government should take action against the unions under the Maharashtra Essential Services Maintenance (MESMA) Act.

Any action leading to interruption of civic services constitutes a strike as per the Act, he added. Mr Deshmukh said AGNI will also be writing to mayor Mahadeo Deole urging him to take citizens into confidence before making any commitment to the unions. He said as public money was being used to pay bonus, the issue was not just a bilateral one between the unions and the BMC.

He, however, argued that improvement in financial health of institutions did not imply that workers should be paid a bonus. â€œThe money should be used for improving civic services instead,â€™â€™ he stated. Civic chief K.C. Srivastava has ruled out the possibility of paying bonus to its 1.3 lakh employees. â€œWe are not in a position to pay bonus.â€™â€™ he stated firmly on Monday. â€œThough the financial condition had improved, interim payment of Rs 4,000 to civic employees as suggested by the pay revision committee and dearness allowance have already burdened the civic exchequer,â€™â€™ he said.

According to Mr Srivastava, the unions had signed an agreement last October promising that they would not strike work for bonus till the matter was decided by the Supreme Court. The administration said the basic question was whether bonus was a customary right of the employees or should it depend on the paying capacity of the organisation. The commissioner said the administration was fully geared to face the strike. The BEST management too, seems unlikely to give in to the workersâ€™ demand.

BEST general manager S. Kshatriya told TNN, â€œWe have presented our financial position to the unions. We hope they will see reason in our argument that the undertakingâ€™s finances do not permit payment of bonus this year.â€™â€™ The BEST administration has also obtained an order from a industrial court restraining the workers from striking work. â€œ breach of the industrial court ruling will amount to contempt of court. Also, if the unions go on strike we can take action against them under the Maharashtra Recognition of Trade Union (MRTU) Act and the Prevention of Unfair Labour Practices (PULP) Act,â€™â€™ a BEST spokesperson said. The unions, however, have found an ally in the ruling Sena, which has taken a considerate, pro-labour stance on the matter. â€œSena chief Bal Thackeray is of the view that civic employees should be paid bonus if BMCâ€™s financial condition is good,â€™â€™ Sena leader S. Sarvankar said at the rally.

Mr Sarvankar and Mr Deole, also of the Sena, addressed the civic employees at Shivaji Park after meeting a delegation of union leaders led by Sharad Rao for resolving the bonus issue. Mr Deole promised to speak with the civic administration about the unionsâ€™ demands.

2,Rail police under fire over arrest of former boxer,"MUMBAI: The Dignity Foundation has criticised the railway police for not informing them or other non-government organisations (NGOs) about the arrest of Aspi Irani (71), former national level boxer. He was arrested for allegedly travelling in a ladies compartment in a Western Railway local on September 20.

Mr Iraniâ€™s arrest has generated a controversy following allegations by social activists that he was ill-treated by the police. One accusation against the police is that they failed to inform the Irani family about his arrest. Since he could not pay the fine of Rs 500, he had to languish in jail for a week.

He was not even allowed to contact his family. Expressing shock over the incident, Dignity Foundation president Sheilu Srinivasan said since members of her organisation interacted with the police on a regular basis, they could have helped the police trace the family. The foundation has been assisting senior citizens in distress, and its volunteers are called by the police every time they come across such cases. â€œIt is strange why the police did not inform us or take the help of a counsellor,â€™â€™ she said, adding that the foundation would raise the issue with the police top brass.

Ms Srinivasan also suggested that the police conduct workshops for its officials on dealing with citizens in general. Meanwhile, assistant commissioner of police R.M. Pargunde began his probe into the incident and has started recording statements of the persons who were arrested along with Mr Irani for the same offence. One of the offenders told him that the police had allowed him to call up his family and he was released after paying the Rs 500 fine. Speaking to this newspaper,Mr Pargunde maintained that there was neither any fault on the part of the police nor any malafide intention.

Any person who is arrested is entitled to judicial assistance, medical check-up and allowed to contact a family member. The police have claimed that Mr Irani had undergone a medical test before being produced before the magistrate. Admitting that the police did not inform any NGO about Mr Iraniâ€™s arrest, Mr Pargunde said he would inquire into it. He, however, said interaction between the railway police and NGOs like Dignity was minimal. Meanwhile, among the questions Mr Iraniâ€™s arrest has raised is if a senior citizen should be booked for a minor offence like this. Mr Pargunde, however, said the police could not discriminate between offenders. â€œIf we let go one offender, the others take objection and demand that they too be released,â€™â€™ he explained.

Besides, an advocate pointed out, in cases of men travelling in womenâ€™s compartment, the prosecution normally relies on the statements of the police witnesses or a railway officer. Seldom are the statements of women commuters or others recorded. According to Mr Pargunde, it is not practical to record the statements of fellow commuters since they are often unwilling to give statements.

Call Dignity Citizens can contact Dignity Foundationâ€™s helpline over phone no 389 8078 to lodge a complaint, for counselling or any other assistance. The helpline is attended by counsellors and social workers between 9.30 a.m. to 7 p.m from Monday to Friday. The foundationâ€™s office telephone number is 384 1845.

3,RSS chides Thackeray for suicide squad remark,"NAGPUR: The RSS on Monday disagreed with Shiv Sena supremo Bal Thackerayâ€™s suggestion to form Hindu suicide squads and the harsh words used by VHP leader Praveen Togadia against Congress president Sonia Gandhi.

â€œMr Thackerayâ€™s remarks (during Dassara rally in Mumbai) appear to be reaction to the Islamic fundamentalist terrorism that has played havoc in the country,â€™â€™ RSS spokesman M.G. Vaidya said. However, he said, â€œHindu suicide squads are not permissible. No Hindu scripture gives sanction to such terrorist activities.â€™â€™

On Mr Togadiaâ€™s recent utterances about Sonia Gandhi, Mr Vaidya said one should use soft and gentle language while criticising ideological opponents. â€œMy personal opinion is that soft words are more effective than harsh ones used against opponents. I donâ€™t know in what context Mr Togadia is alleged to have used those words,â€™â€™ he added.

When asked about VHP president Ashok Singhalâ€™s outburst against the PMâ€™s security advisor, Brajesh Mishra, Mr Vaidya said an explanation should be sought from the VHP leadership.

The short-term plans cover those policies that can be put into practice within six months. Rationalisation of bus routes is one such short-term plan.

""The transport system will be restructured such that there will be no undue competition with the upcoming Metro service,"" a source in the transport departmentsaid. Buses will be forced to adhere to the time schedule which has been revised by the state transport department.

""All aspects, including routes and timings, will be designed such that the existing modes of transport and the Metro complement each other,"" the source said.

The first section of the Metro will begin functioning from December this year. The medium-term plans, which are to be implemented between six months and a year, include the eco-friendly electric trolley buses.

Two routes have been worked out by the department for plying these buses. The long-term plans, which will be implements between one to five years, include a fully-functional Metro. ""By 2006-07, the entire operating plan is likely to come into force,"" a source said. The policy document will also contain a report on the issue of sustainable transport.

The report, compiled by transport and infrastructure experts, under the chairmanship of state chief minister Sheila Dikshit, has recommended various modes of transport.

The operating plan and the report was prepared after exhaustive deliberations by experts, policy-makers, commuters and other stakeholders in two workshops held in a span of a month. The policy also reviews the various modes of transport available in the city. This will include details on financing buses and required infrastructure.

School transport is also likely to feature in a big way in the report.

Ensuring safe driving, fitness of vehicles and drivers, better parking, vehicular emissions and improving pollution check systems will also figure in the document.

5,"Court orders arrest of rape accused, cancels bail","NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court has ordered the arrest of the persons accused of raping an Uzbek tourist who had managed to get bail fraudulently. Justice J D Kapoor directed the police commissioner to personally ensure that the accused were arrested, produced before the court and sent to Tihar Jail.

The judge set aside the bail order when it was brought to his notice that the accused were arrested after the rape of the tourist in May 2000 and their bail was rejected by a court earlier.

But when one court rejected their application, the accused again pleaded for bail on the same grounds before the vacations sessions judge during court holidays, concealing the fact that their bail had already been rejected by the other court. As a result, they secured bail.

Taking a serious note of their attempt to hoodwink the court, the judge observed that the fact that they concealed the dismissal of their bail application showed ""the clandestine, unscrupulous and unethical ways the bail was procured"".

The court noted that when she resisted the assailants, she was battered before being sexually assaulted. The accused pulled her hair and then hit her head against the wall to overpower her.

""The description of the incident by her makes out a very grave and serious offence. It is also sad that the FIR was not lodged on her complaint, but on the complaint of the first secretary of the embassy of Uzbekistan, who talked to her in Russian and narrated it (the events) in English to the police,"" the judge noted in the order.

""She had come as a tourist to the country and was raped. Such incidents not only slur the (country''s) reputation but also deter tourists. The culprits have to be dealt with a heavy hand,"" the judge observed.

6,Cong may be forced to form govt without PDP,"NEW DELHI: The Congress seems to be still firm on leading a government in J&K. With the PDP chief Mufti Mohammed Sayeed not willing to relent on the issue of the chief ministership, the Congress party will be forced to form an alternate government excluding the PDP from the coalition.

Senior Congress leader Manmohan Singh''s talks with the PDP chief has not been fruitful as Mufti did not climb down from his single point agenda of becoming the chief minister himself. Congress offered deputy CM''s post to his daughter Mehbooba Mufti and chairmanship of a coordination committee to the Mufti. But the Mufti did not relent.

Congress also offered the rotation formula, promising the Mufti the CM''s post after three years. But the Mufti was not willing to accept anything less than the CM''s post.

Talking to reporters here on Monday , the Congress legislature party leader Ghulam Nabi Azad said, out of the 18 independent MLAs supporting Congress, 15 have given support only to a Congress led government. Azad clarified that the block of independents is numerically stronger than the PDP that has only 16 MLAs.

However Azad refused to say whether the Congress leadership will decide to go ahead with government formation excluding PDP after its meeting on Tuesday. He claimed that the MLAs in the valley are not for sale and that the Congress has not attempted to break the PDP. But refused to comment on the possibility of a large chunk of PDP legislatures giving support to Congress.

After her tour in Uttar Pradesh, Congress president Sonia Gandhi will meet with her senior leaders in the evening to decide the future course of action.

7,Congress rally in Rohtak on Oct 27,"CHANDIGARH: Condemning the state government for not taking any action so far against those responsible for the killing of five Dalits in Jhajjar district, the Haryana Congress on Monday resolved to intensify its â€œChautala hatao, Haryana bachaoâ€� campaign. It will hold a state-level rally on October 27 at Rohtak considered to be the centre of Jat politics the state.

A decision to this effect was taken by district Congress presidents at a meeting presided by AICC secretary V. Hanmantha Rao here.

Speaking at a press conference after the meeting, state Congress president Bhajan Lal said that keeping in view the seriousness of the crime committed in Jhajjar, the government should order a judicial probe into the circumstances leading to the killings.

The governmentâ€™s decision to order an inquiry by the Rohtak divisional commissioner was not acceptable to the Congress, said Bhajan. He added that if the government failed to take any action against the perpetrators of this crime within 15 days, the Congress would convene a â€˜â€˜mahapanchayatâ€™â€™ to chalk out its future course of action in the matter.

Condemning the government move to open casinos in the state, he said that his party would strongly oppose it during the special assembly session commencing here from October 30. He, however, refused to comment on the state governmentâ€™s decision to introduce online lottery, the rules and regulations for which were approved by the state cabinet recently.

In reply to a question, Bhajan clarified that his party had never favoured free power for farm sector. A farmer needed an uninterrupted supply of quality power, Bhajan observed demanding that the drought relief of Rs 20 per quintal announced by the Centre should also be given to those farmers who sold their paddy before October 1.

It was also decided at the meeting that in future the rallies of the party would be presided over by the concerned district party president. Rao appealed to all party leaders and workers to work unitedly for the success of these rallies and also to send right signals to the people of the state who were itching to vote the Indian National Lok Dal out of power.

The district Congress presidents through a resolution also hailed partyâ€™s victory in the Jammu and Kashmir elections and said that the outcome of this election had once again established that the common man was not in favour of the policies and programmes of National Democratic Alliance government led by BJP. It condemned derogatory remarks made by VHP leaders against Sonia Gandhi and said that the recent electoral victories of the Congress had, in fact, unnerved these leaders.

8,SGPC polls to be held on Nov 12,"KURUKSHETRA: The battle lines were drawn for the crucial Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) elections with panel president Kirpal Singh Badungar announcing here on Monday that the annual executive elections would take place in Amritsar on November 12.

He said the SGPC would not seek observers from the Centre to supervise the elections, expected to be a tumultuous event. Badungar announced this during the SGPC executive meeting held here at the historic gurdwara built in the memory of the sixth Guru. When asked if he would be in the fray this time, Badungar said it was for the SAD to decide, but he was not averse to it.

Admitting that about 100 SGPC members, owing allegiance to the Badal camp, would remain in hiding in Haryana and Himachal Pradesh till the D-day, Badungar launched a frontal attack on chief minister Amarinder Singh and former SGPC president Gurcharan Singh Tohra for joining hands to unleash terror on the members. He said it was reprehensible on the part of the chief minister to resort to intimidatory tactics.

Badungar was unsparing of Tohra as well. He blamed him for making a shameful compromise with the Congress government to topple the Badal group in the SGPC. After condemning the Congress for opposing the Sikh cause all through, he has now thrown in his lot with them to wrest the SGPC top post, he added.

Pooh-poohing Tohraâ€™s pronouncement that he would not be the presidential candidate, he said the former had made similar announcements in the past, and then backtracked. The man who is seeking votes from SGPC members in the name of conscience should think how right it is to join hands with the Congress in his battle against Badal, Badungar said.

The SGPC chief was also critical of the campaign of the third front to pick up an unanimous, apolitical candidate to rid the SGPC of petty politics. He said all the proponents of this including Mal Singh Ghumman, who is in the forefront, are already members of political parties.

On an optimistic note, he said the Badal camp would certainly win the coming elections. The Tohra faction in the SGPC executive was not sure if the former was a nominee for the presidential post. Tohra loyalist Hardip Singh Mohali said he was campaigning for a consensus candidate and, as a member of the third front, he would meet top Akali leaders including Badal to bring unanimity among them. Another Tohra follower, Sukhdev Singh Bhaur, said the party would soon decide on the matter.

They welcomed Badungarâ€™s announcement that the election would take place in the Golden Temple.

9,Buddha invites ministers to McKinsey meet,"KOLKATA: In view of the controversy within the state cabinet over the proposals made by the McKinsey & Co , the US based consultant for the government, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has asked almost a dozen ministers to join a meeting of the state investment promotion board to hear the company representatives on Tuesday.

Mckinsey representatives will submit their final report on the investment possibilities in IT and agri-business, particularly food processing. â€œThey have not only identified possible investors in both the sectors but also held preliminary negotiations with them,â€™â€™ said Bhattacharjee. The meeting of the board, second after its formation, would review the investment scenario in the state till August 2002.

Big guns like Pepsi are interested in bottling green coconut water as well as procuring pulps of fruits like mango, litchi and pineapple. â€œThey are not interested in the primary processing but in processing of pulps and marketing. It is our small-scale units which will do the primary processing. This would help both the local growers as well as local industry,â€™â€™ said state industry minister Nirupam Sen. However, he was rather cautious against painting a rosy picture in view of the overall bleak scenario due to the worldwide industrial recession.

10,More cash crop in agri policy,"KOLKATA: Eight years from now, West Bengal may fail to produce enough rice to meet the rising demand of an ever increasing population. Yet, the state government seems to be determined to release a â€œsignificant proportionâ€� of the rice producing land for production of flower, fruits, orchids and other cash crops. In its newly drafted agricultural policy, which will be placed before the Cabinet for approval soon, the state government has also announced that it would soon prepare a detailed land use policy and identify areas which would stop producing rice and instead concentrate on production of cash crops.

The new agro-policy, however, is significantly silent on whether MNCs would be allowed to enter into contract farming with the cultivators in the state. Neither does it mention the role that MNCs would play in marketing these cash crops.The earlier agro-policy, which had been prepared in May last year and had argued in favour of the MNCs, had been rejected by the state cabinet after the Forward Bloc, CPI and the RSP refused to allow them entry in the agricultural sector. The ministers of these parties had observed that the entry of MNCs in the stateâ€™s agriculture would result in a major deviation from the policies being followed by the CPM-led Left Front for the last 25 years. They had also objected to the manner the chief minister introduced the policy paper in the cabinet without discussing it first in the Left Front meting. What seems to be more intriguing is that the new policy never cared to explain why the government was in a hurry to convert rice producing lands into cash crop producing ones even after admitting that it might be difficult to meet the demand of 15.5 MT of rice in the year 2010.

All it did was to promise that attempts would be made to increase the average yield of rice from the present 2.2 tonnes to 3.4 tonnes per year to meet the demand. Other important recommendations of the new agricultural policy include : l Identification of specific areas and zones for production of fruit, vegetable, flowers, aromatic and medicinal plants, orchids, cocoa, vanilla, mushroom, root & tuber crops. lIntroduction of 6-10 month courses in applied agriculture for cultivators and rural youth l To restructure the two agricultural universities in the state.

11,Action group for pesticide policy,"HYDERABAD: An action group to promote non-chemical farming, stop entry of agrochemical multinational corporations (MNCs), promoting synthetic pesticides in India, and promote sustainable agriculture has been formed by non-governmental organisations (NGOs).

The Community Action for Elimination of Pesticides (CAPE), formed last week, is in the process of formulating a strategy to pressurise the Centre to bring out a comprehensive policy on pesticides and reduce and eliminate their use.

NGOs from different states, including Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Gujarat and Punjab, are part of this forum.

The CAPE includes Green Peace India, Kaethi Virasat, a Punjab-based NGO, Thanal, an NGO from Kerala, Bangalore-based Community Health Cell, the Andhra Pradesh Ryot Sangam, Toxic Links-New Delhi, Anthra, an NGO based in Pune and the Centre for Resource Education (CRE), Hyderabad.

The aim of the action group is to ensure reduction and gradual elimination of chemical pesticides that cause health problems.

The action group will also strive towards ensuring that MNCs do not try to promote and sell in India pesticides that have been banned in other countries because of their proven toxicity, CRE executive director D Narasimha Reddy said.

Simultaneously, non-chemical agriculture will also be promoted and campaigns will be undertaken to educate farmers on use of pesticides. The campaigns will also focus on payment of compensation to farmers and workers affected due to pesticide exposure and their families in the event of death.

12,Naidu tells Naxalites to shun violence,"HYDERABAD: Chief minister Chandrababu Naidu on Monday utilised the police Commemoration Day forum to appeal to the naxalites to shun the path of violence and join the mainstream.

Addressing police personnel at the Police Martyrsâ€™ Memorial at Goshamahal Stadium here, Naidu said extremism has devastated the lives of people of the state. â€œThere is no place for violence in civil society and this problem must end,â€� he said, urging the naxalites to give up their armed struggle.

â€œOver the past decade, the naxalites destroyed government assets worth several crores. To make up for the loss, the government had to impose taxes on people. Finally, it is the people who are losing because of the extremist actions,â€� Naidu disclosed.

Dwelling on the various aspects of policing, the chief minister commended the city police for controlling communal violence.

The officers working in Rayalaseema were yet to wipe out faction violence. â€œThe criminals are using technology to their advantage. The police must be equipped with the latest gadgets to counter the organised gangs,â€� he said.

A total of 972 police personnel, 47 from Andhra Pradesh, lost their lives in action during the current year.

Home minister T Devender Goud, Union minister Bandaru Dattatreya and DGP Pervaram Ramulu also addressed the gathering.

Later, Naidu interacted with the families of policemen who died in action.

Earlier, contingents of the city police, AP Special Police, mounted police, traffic police and armed reserve presented an impressive parade. Bands from the APSP and city police sounded the last post as a mark of respect.

13,Madhucon Group refuses to pay farmers' dues,"KHAMMAM: Farmers working for the 25-year-old Palair Co-operative Sugar Factory in Khammam district have been left in the lurch after the private group that took over the factory refused to settle their dues.

The Madhucon Group of Companies bought Palair Sugars last week for Rs 9.53 crore. After the takeover, the managing director of the group Nama Nageswara Rao made it clear that the share capital issue has to be settled by the state government and not the new management.

The foundation stone for Palair Co-operative Sugar Factory was laid by the former chief minister Jalagam Vengala Rao on Feb. 12, 1976 and the operations began in 1982. Nearly 5,000 farmers under the Palair Sugars had invested Rs 65 lakh as share capital in early 80''s when the factory was in co-operative sector.

The move to privatise the factory was opposed by the farmers, who all along expressed fears that they will lose the value of their shares.

Former MP and CPM secretary Tammineni Veerabhadram criticised the government''s attitude and demanded the state government to take back the shares of the farmers vis-a-vis the private management.

The Palair Sugars farmers union representatives said that the banks which granted loans for purchase of shares in mid 80''s were now demanding them to repay the loans with cumulative interest. However, the farmers of are hoping that the chief minister may make a statement on this issue when he visits Khammam next week.

14,Govt failed to rescue farmers: Congress,"HYDERABAD: Congress MP and All India Congress Kisan Khet Mazdoor co-chairman Renuka Chowdary has demanded that the government immediately announce a contingency plan for the rabi season to rescue farmers in the state.

Alleging that the government had failed to announce any action plan for the farming community, she demanded that steps be taken to educate farmers about alternative cropping patterns and provide subsidies for them.

Speaking to reporters on Monday, the Congress MP warned that farmers would launch a non-cooperation movement if the government failed to come out with contingency plans immediately.

She expressed concern that due to drought there was an acute shortage of fodder while the prices of poultry and fish feed have been witnessing a spiralling rise. Several places were also facing drinking water shortage. â€œBut there has been no action from the government side to mitigate the problems faced by the people in the drought affected areas,â€� she said.

Renuka Chowdary said that the All India Kisan Khet Mazdoor would shortly meet the prime minister, Union finance and commerce ministers to apprise them about the situation in Andhra Pradesh and seek funds for the state.

Meanwhile, Renuka Chowdary and Mahila Congress president J Geeta Reddy launched a scathing attack on the Vishwa Hindu Parishad leader Praveen Togadia for his comments on Sonia Gandhi.

â€œBy making remarks denigrating women, the VHP has proved that it is against women,â€� they said, adding that the VHP leaderâ€™s comments were only aimed at getting publicity for his organisation.

They said that the VHP and the political forces behind it were in a state of panic over the â€œever increasing popularityâ€� of Sonia Gandhi.

15,Govt-power staff talks remain inconclusive,"LUCKNOW: Constitution of four distribution companies and handing over of KESCO to the NTPC proved to be the main stumbling block in the second round of talks on Monday between the Uttar Pradesh Power Technical Employees Joint Action Committee and the government.

The talks, though inconclusive, did make some headway with the government agreeing to set up a high-level technical committee to carry out a review of the post-reform activities. The committee members including Shailendra Dubey, AK Singh, Parshuram and Captan Singh, amongst others, held talks with principal secretary, energy, RB Bhaskar and CMD UPPCL AK Mishra in which they made it clear that a high-tech panel be constituted for reviewing post reform activities. While the officials agreed to the same, they stressed that the process of constituting the discoms would be carried out simultaneously. This was unacceptable to the union leaders who maintained that the exercise would be meaningless if the panel rejected the setting up of discoms.

The talks ended in a deadlock over the issue. The officials responded favourably to the second major demand of the employees regarding the opening of an ESCROW account for the transfer of revenue money straight into the employeesâ€™ trust. The government owes Rs 9,000 crores by way of GPF, pension and gratuity. The officials said the proposal was being examined.

Stating categorically that the government had rejected the proposal to convert the Obra thermal power plant into a joint venture company with the NTPC, the energy officials said the other demand regarding revival of 17,000 posts was being looked into. They said the government would form a committee to look into how many posts were viable and needed to be revived. Dubey said the employees would go ahead with their planned strike. Work boycott would be resorted to on October 22 from 8 am. A torch light procession would be taken out at all district headquarters and in Lucknow on October 23.

The employees would proceed on an indefinite strike from 10 am on October 24. Meanwhile, president of the Vidyut Karamchari Morcha Sangathan Chandra Prakash Awasthi, at a press conference on Monday, said support of the trade unions from abroad had also been solicited through the Public Service International (PSI). The help of the PSI had been taken during the strike of January 25, 2000 in which trade unions of 15 countries had extended their support to the striking power employees of UP.

16,Decision on J&K govt on Tuesday: Manmohan,"NEW DELHI: Congress president Sonia Gandhi has called a meeting of senior party colleagues on Tuesday to decide on government formation in J&K, after party leader Manmohan Singh's ""mission Kashmir"" failed to break the political deadlock.Manmohan Singh, who returned empty-handed from Srinagar on Monday evening, briefed Sonia on his two-day visit at a meeting that lasted over an hour. Detailed talks in J&K with Mufti Mohammad Sayeed have come to naught, with the People's Democratic Party leader still adamant on heading a coalition government.While Singh said suggestions and counter-suggestions were made on both sides, the PDP is believed to have turned down a Congress offer of deputy chief ministership for Mehbooba Mufti and several key posts for other party members.The senior Congress leader said Sonia would now 'hopefully' take a final decision after consulting other senior party leaders on Tuesday. The Congress president had sent Singh in a last ditch effort to persuade the Mufti after over a week of negotiations failed to yield resultsRefusing to comment on talks in Srinagar on the contentious CM issue, Singh only said that it was among other issues discussed with the Mufti. He said the party was trying to ensure that a government that is ""responsive to the mandate given by the people of J&K is installed"". Manmohan Singh also held discussions with MLAs of smaller parties like the CPI(M) and Bhim Singh's Panthers Party apart from Independents, and made a courtesy call on Governor G.C. Saxena. The Congress needs the PDP, which has 16 MLAs, to make up the magic figure of 44 needed for a simple majority. Ever since announcement of results, the two parties have been engaged in hectic parleys but have repeatedly hit a roadblock over who will head a coalition government. While the Congress says with more seats it would be the senior partner and so should lead, the PDP has refused to give in arguing that it represents the Kashmir Valley's aspirations. The Congress is now left with few options but to force a split in the PDP, which it has indicated it would not like to do in a hurry.Congress sources here said that with the firm commitment of 20 MLAs apart from its own members, the party now has 40 in the 87-member Assembly and may explore the option of staking claim and then proving majority on the floor of the House.

17,"Prove allegations, I'll quit politics: Nitish","PATNA: Railway Minister Nitish Kumar on Tuesday brushed aside accusations bestowing undue favour to his party colleagues in awarding railway contracts and said he would quit politics if the allegations were proved.

""Not to talk about holding the railway ministry...I am also ready to resign from politics if anyone shows up an evidence that my office has bestowed undue favour for anybody in awarding tenders,"" Kumar told reporters while replying to questions on alleged irregularities in awarding the contracts.

Taking a dig at his political opponents, particularly RJD supremo Laloo Prasad Yadav, for allegedly indulging in vilification campaign against him, Kumar said ""My political career is transparent. I am honest to the core of my heart and will remain so all through.""

Those who had looted the state exchequer were alleging that the railway minister had nexus with criminals, he said, adding people of Bihar were well aware of it.

""Give me a specific example of irregularity. I will hand over the charge of inquiry into it to CBI,"" Kumar said adding much transparency was being maintained on award of contracts.

Admitting that reputed firms were scared to bid for railway contracts in Bihar because of the law and order situation, Kumar said effective steps were being taken to ensure complete fairness in bidding.

A new system was also being introduced to circulate the tender documents on Internet. Interested firms or persons might download the same and fill up the tenders papers and sent them to concerned offices by post, he said.

18,Cong-led govt will be unstable without us: PDP,"SRINAGAR: People''s Democratic Party vice-President Muzaffar Baig on Tuesday said any Congress-led government in Jammu and Kashmir without the presence of his party will be ""unstable"" and asserted that the two parties needed each other in providing a ""stable and responsive"" government.

""Our efforts will be to continue talks to form a stable government in cooperation with the Congress and I hope doors are not closed by the Congress (on talks with PDP) because Congress is a larger party,"" Baig said here.

Baig''s remarks came in response to comments by President of the J&K unit of Congress Ghulam Nabi Azad, on how long can the Congress go on in holding parleys with the PDP to break the deadlock on the chief ministership issue.

""We need them (Congress). They need us. We must respect the verdict of the people and provide a responsible, stable government,"" he said.

Baig said the stand taken by PDP on the chief ministership issue has been misunderstood and regretted that the whole thing has become ""messy"".

""Our stand (claiming chief ministership) was not because we are power hungry,"" he said.

Baig said if Congress forms a government without the PDP and the National Conference it would be a minority government like formed by P V Narasimha Rao in 1991.""With NC and PDP sitting in the opposition, it would be difficult for them (Congress) to provide a stable government. I don''t think Congress will approach any factions of NC and PDP,"" he said.

19,Decision on Gujarat assembly polls soon: EC,"SHIMLA: The Election Commission would shortly take a decision on holding Assembly polls in Gujarat.

""The situation was being monitored and any decision about holding Assembly polls in the state would be taken shortly,"" Election Commissioner T S Krishnamurthy, who is here in connection with preparations for Himachal Pradesh Assembly polls, told newsmen on Tuesday.

Earlier, Election Commissioner T S Krishnamurthy said it would take an effort to make the electoral rolls available on it''s website before the next Lok Sabha elections in 2004.

The electoral rolls for Delhi had already been made available on the website and efforts were on to cover more states, said Krishanamurthy.

The ultimate aim of the commission was to have the electoral rolls online with photograph and other details of the voter but it was a long process and might take a longer time, he added.

Krishnamurthy expressed hope that photo identity cards would be provided to maximum number of voters in assembly elections in Himachal Pradesh.

21,Animal trainers protest against Maneka Gandhi,"NEW DELHI: Animal trainers, along with their monkeys and bears, staged a demonstration on Tuesday to protest former Union minister Maneka Gandhiâ€™s alleged remarks against their community and demanded an apology from her.

About 150 people gathered at Jantar Mantar under the banner of Qulander Panchayat, a body for animal traders, to protest against the objectionable remarks. They shouted slogans against Gandhi. The former Union minister had allegedly dubbed the kalanders (animal trainers) as a community of thieves, cheats and murderers in an article that appeared on the edit page of a Hindi daily.

Claiming that performing on streets with their animals was their occupation for generations, the demonstrators marched to Gandhiâ€™s residence to submit a memorandum of their demands.

â€˜â€˜She did not come out to receive the memorandum, so we left it with her staff. We have also left memorandums with the President protesting against the unprovoked attack on our community,â€™â€™ said Qulander Panchayat president Dhirendra Pratap.

â€˜â€˜The said article gives the instance of a langur trapped by a madari. Clearly she is not aware that the madari samaj does not keep animals other than monkeys and bears. She should desist from commenting on our community in the absence of proper knowledge,â€™â€™ he added.

But Pratap conceded that in some parts of the country, people stole animals from the jungle and sold them in the market.

22,Delhi govt's new policy focuses on public transport,"NEW DELHI: A policy which promises to shift the emphasis from personal vehicles to cheap and pollution-free public transport was unveiled by the Delhi government on Tuesday.

Five thousand more buses will be put on the road as the policy is implemented in phases over five years. Services will be structured to complement the Metro Rail.

â€˜â€˜For the first time, a blueprint has been made for the transport sector and there are deadlines. Responsibilities have been fixed for each stage,â€™â€™ state transport minister Ajay Maken said.

â€˜â€˜Along with an increase in buses, their efficiency, punctuality and a better carrying system are also important for the convenience of commuters,â€™â€™ the minister said. About 4,000 CNG buses on chartered and premium services will also be introduced.

â€˜â€˜The routes, timings and parking of the buses, autos, taxis have been designed to supplement the movement of mass transit system,â€™â€™ he said. New technology vehicles, like electric trolley buses and high-capacity buses plying over 100km will be put on the road.

Buses will be given road space so that they move quickly and efficiently. Autos, taxis and the slow-moving cycle rickshaws will be used to provide feeder services to the bus system and the Metro. â€˜â€˜This segment of intermediate public transport will be continue to play a crucial role as it will bridge the gap between the commutersâ€™ homes and the nearest mass transport centres,â€™â€™ Maken said.

Passenger amenities like helplines, route guide maps, fare charts and time-tables have also been planned for implementation.

While integration and upgradation of the transport system will go on, the state government has earmarked almost 25 per cent of its budget for the all-important transport sector. â€˜â€˜A total of Rs 5,446 crore will be spent on transport and related infrastructure in the city in the next five years,â€™â€™ he said.

About Rs 2,938 crore will be spent by the state transport department (including Rs 1,441 crore for Metro rail) and another Rs 2,507 crore will be provided by the civic agencies, MCD, NDMC, PWD and Trans Yamuna Development Board.

The policy, which defines time-bound tasks for these agencies, also calls for an Integrated Metropolitan Transport Authority (IMTA) for better coordination among them. Until IMTA is formed, a Delhi Transport Planning Group under the chairmanship of Chief minister will be set up. These agencies are required to ensure better parking, widening of roads, removal of encroachment and construction of cycle tracks and flyovers.

Our Comment This is a sound proposal, which would go a long way towards decongesting Delhiâ€™s roads, depolluting the atmosphere and relieving drivers of road rage. However, the spate of violent attacks, particularly on women, in various modes of public transport raises serious questions about how safe these alternatives would be.

23,Lok Ayukta raids govt offices in Hoskote,"BANGALORE: Lok Ayukta N.Venkatachala and his sleuths raided the government offices in Hoskote on Tuesday.

At the office of the Assistant Director of Land Records, they found 1,500 pending cases. Some cases had been pending from 1996. The complainants alleged that the officers here acted only when a bribe was paid.

The Lok Ayukta sleuths also raided education offices in Hoskote. The education officer said he had visited all the 278 schools in his jurisdiction. However, he could not produce any evidence to prove it. The officer had 15 petitions pending before him.

The team then visited the Taluk Municipal Council offices and found that it had over 150 khatas pending from years. The registers were seized. The chief officer and his staff were grilled by the Lok Ayukta.

The Taluk Magistrate Court was also inspected and over 55 pending cases were realised. While perusing the record books, the found a khata application pending from 1998. The applicant M. Appajappa had given up on the khata.

An inspection of the government hospital revealed that none of the doctors were residents here although the rules specified so.

He was also booked under sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act along with the others. The patients alleged that the doctors referred patients to labs with which they had an understanding. Names of the three favoured pathological labs have been taken up for enquiry.

24,Gowda threatens nationwide farmers' stir,"NEW DELHI: Former prime minister H D Deve Gowda says he will organise ``nationwide'''' agitations of farmers if the Vajpayee government does not accept a long charter of his Janata Dal (S) on protection and income support for the community.

He, and another former PM, Vishvanath Pratap Singh, addressed a rally of farmers from Karnataka here on Tuesday. The farmers were brought here in a hired train.

Both the former PMs said the condition of farmers was ``pathetic'''' owing to an uncaring government. They said that the current policies expose farmers to unfair competition, on the one hand, and restrict their opportunities to sell for a better price in open markets, on the other.

Deve Gowda was to have later met Vajpayee, but the appointment was cancelled due to the latter''s throat illness.

Gowda said he would deliver the charter of demands to Vajpayee and if it was accepted and implemented without delay, there would be no need for a farmers'' agitation all over the country. But if this was not done, he would go ahead and organise the agitations, he said.

25,Rane takes DF govt. to task for fiscal ‘mismanagement’,"MUMBAI: Narayan Tatu Rane has always been knownâ€” and admiredâ€” in the stateâ€™s political and administrative circles for his passion for facts, figures and finery.

As chairman of the municipalised BEST committee in the late 1980s, Mr Rane would spend hours with senior bureaucrats piecing together the nut, bolt and the chassis of the BESTâ€™s account books.

The leader of the opposition has yet again marshalled his drafting skills to take the ruling DF government to task for the â€˜mismanagementâ€™ of the stateâ€™s finances. That the Shiv Sena leader should brandish the pen is a tad surprising for party which believes in street-savvy politics and suicide squads. The Sena has of late been spearheading a series of â€˜raasta-rokosâ€™ in Mumbai to condemn the DF rule.

In a slim booklet released on Tuesday, Mr Rane discusses the â€˜failuresâ€™ of the Vilasrao Deshmukh ministry which completed three years in office on October 18. Studded with straight facts, culled together by Mr Rane, and crooked lines by noted caricaturist Vikas Sabnis, the Marathi booklet is a stronglyworded indictment of the ruling DF alliance which dismantled the Sena-BJP regime headed by Mr Rane after the 1999 assembly elections.

â€œOver the last few days the state government has been assiduously marketing its â€˜gainsâ€™. But facts are contrary to the claims made by the CM and the deputy CM. The CM is actually misleading the people of the state. Maharashtraâ€™s financial condition is pitiable,â€™â€™ Mr Rane told journalists after the booklet was released by senior Sena MLA Dattaji Nalavade at the Senaâ€™s Nariman Point headquarters.

With revenue deficit reaching a staggering 109 per cent and a 12 per cent cut in capital expenditure, the state is groaning under astronomical financial burden. In its July 2002 report, ICRA, a leading rating agency, has brought down Maharashtra from LAA to LA, a poor third position. Moreover, the IDBI, in a recent petition before the debt recovery tribunal, suggested that the co-operation departmentâ€™s office in Mantralaya be seized to recover Rs 550 crore from the state government as it failed to honour the loan guarantee to IDBI, Mr Rane said.

â€œDistrict treasuries have been shut down and at least two state-controlled irrigation corporations have been declared defaulters. Even senior artistes have not been getting their measly monthly pensions as the state exchequer is empty,â€™â€™ he said.

aâ€œThe latest move to register a case against Sena chief Bal Thackeray for his outbursts is the state governmentâ€™s clever ploy to deflect the attention of the people from the grave problems that affect the state,â€™â€™ Mr Rane said.

26,Gujarat farmers get restive without power,"GANDHINAGAR: The failure of the last round of rains leading to the drought situation in several talukas of Gujarat has led to the eruption of violent farmers'' protests demanding increase in power supply at several places over the last fortnight.

In three specific cases - Jotana in Mehsana district, Nakhatrana in Kutch district and Ankleshwar in Bharuch district - the state energy department on Monday asked the state home department to urgently provide police protection to the Gujarat Electricity Board sub-stations as GEB officials were being attacked.

At an incident at Jotana early this month, nearly 200 farmers of the village attacked the 66 KB sub-station of the Mehsana city feeder, injuring a helper on duty. Few days later, at Nakhatrana, nearly 400 farmers attacked two sub-stations of 240 KB and 66 KB of the city feeder, injuring six officers on duty. And more recently, at Ankleshwar, another 200 farmers attacked the subdivisional office supplying electricity to the rural areas, damaging records and injuring six, with anti-socials running away with Rs 1.6 lakh in cash. The situation is calm, but tension runs high at other places now.

The protests at the three places were triggered by the sudden snapping of 18 to 24 hours of assured supply ''mistakenly'' being given to the farmers at a highly subsidised rate over several years from the city feeders, changing the regime to just eight hours a day, as in the rest of rural Gujarat.

A state energy department note says that there hundreds of city feeders from which the farmers have been getting highly subsidised power, even though they are not entitled to it. The assured power supply of 18 to 24 hours a day is meant for those consumers who pay competitive rates. With the assured supply gone, the farmers are now restive. ""The attacks at Jotana, Nakhatrana and Ankleshwar were spontaneous in nature"", the senior official said.

In fact, the farm sector currently accounts for about 80 per cent of the additional demand for power in the state. ""The maximum demand catered to right now is 7,253 MW"", said the official.

""This is against the demand-supply gap of about 1,000 MW, most of it on account of the increased farm-sector requirements in view of the failure of the last round of rains. The farmers want water badly, but the GEB works against unprecedented financial strain, hence it is not possible to fulfil the demand"". The GEB off-season supply goes down to as low as 6,000 MW.

28,"Post-riots, quantum jump in NGO's membership","AHMEDABAD: Among the manifold consequences of the infamous communal riots early this year, is one statistic that might do the world of community workers and NGOs proud. It is the fact of Sewa''s membership having done a neat jump, an increase which is primarily accounted for by Muslim women.

Says Sewa director Reema Nanavaty, ""Sewa''s membership has gone up from 2,84,000 in 2001 to 5,30,000 this year. While Muslim members constituted 14 per cent last year, they account for a whopping 60 per cent of membership in 2002.""

Interestingly, Ahmedabad''s Sewa membership has also gone up from 68,000 to 1,30,000. While earlier the Muslims accounted for 15-20 per cent of the membership in the city, this year it was a straight 40 per cent.

Not surprisingly, most new members are also from the worst riot-hit areas like Gomtipur, Chamanpura, Dariapur, Amraiwadi, Bapunagar, Rakhial, Saraspur and Behrampura.

""Like our post-quake rehabilitation efforts, this time also, at the relief camps we have focussed on livelihood security, because Sewa believes in self-reliance rather than hand-outs. In fact, we still have ongoing training programmes at the Haj centre at Saraspur and Shahpur. The programmes are in tailoring, hospital attendance, hospitality business, accounting and financial activities,"" says Nanavaty.

Membership has also increased in the rural areas, which account for most of Sewa membership. Sewa president Rannbai Rauma (who incidentally is from the minority community, too) vouches for the increase in rural membership. ""In Patan district where I belong to, every village must have seen an increase of 100-150 members, at least after the riots. With regular job prospects being dim in drought-prone districts like ours, we find the secular, non-political agenda of Sewa very easy to work with. Most of our members are into salt farming and gum collection, a few are into embroidery,"" says Rauma. Patan has also seen an increase in membership from about 60,000 to close to a lakh this year.

Sewa has also been asked by the prime minister to outline a three-year integrated livelihood project for widows and children orphaned in the riots in Ahmedabad city and five other districts - Vadodara, Panchmahals, Sabarkantha, Anand and Mehsana. ""This project would be totally conceived by us and will be implemented in co-operation with both the state government and the government of India under the department of women, children''s welfare and social justice,"" says Nanavaty.

Maybe, politicians should take a leaf out of the Sewa book to figure out priorities, for now Rauma and other-like-minded members have kept riots aside and are planning measures to mitigate the effects of the next disaster, that of drought.

29,Prominent citizens protest sale of land in city,"PUNE: Around 300 citizens, including prominent social activists like G.P. Pradhan, Baba Adhav and Swati Shah, have dashed off letters to the charity commissioner, Mumbai, objecting the sale of the Kasturbai mangal karyalaya and sanatorium in the city.

Others who have sent similar letters are; former vice-chancellor of the Shivaji University P.G. Patil, former labour commissioner Chittaranjan Dingre, Former IAS officer Ram Belavadi and Nate-Pute Jain community official Sheetal Doshi.

The citizens have urged the charity commissioner to treat their letters as ""complaints"" and group them with the original complaint filed by the Jain community leader in city, Bharat Kothadiya. Kothadiya was the first to object to the Walchand Hirachand Lok Kalyan Trustâ€™s move to sell off these two prime properties, located along the Ganeshkhind road. The charity commissioner, after admitting Kothadiyaâ€™s complaint for hearing, has asked the trust to submit its say on the objections raised by Kothadiya. The trust has sought time from the commissioner to reply to the objections.

In an affidavit to the charity commissioner, trustee Ajit Gulabchand has admitted that the trust has entered into an agreement with a Punebased construction firm, Pearly Blue Developers, to sell off the property for Rs 7 crore. He has justified the move by saying that the net annual income generated by the karyalaya and the sanatorium is around Rs 20 lakh. Though this earning is substantial as compared to the expenses of salaries and maintenance, it is far less if compared to the interest the trust would earn on the amount raised through the sale. The trustees feel that the proposal to sell off the property was a better option than getting the rental income. The sale proceeds will be used for charitable activities, Gulabchand has asserted. However, this very argument has become a bone of contention as Kothadiya has debated, ""It is true that the income generated by investing the sale proceeds would exceed the present income. But, if all trusts in the country start selling off their properties on this ground alone, then there would be no charitable hospitals, schools, colleges, sanatoriums or marriage halls left for the benefit of the common man"". His stand on the issue has evoked support not only from members of the Jain community, but even from the non-Jain community members.

Kothadiya has appealed like-minded citizens to write similar letters to the charity commissioner at: 83, Annie Besant road, Worli, Mumbai 400018. He has requested the citizens to send a copy of their letters to him at: C-54, Abhimanshree society, Pashan road, Pune 411008.
