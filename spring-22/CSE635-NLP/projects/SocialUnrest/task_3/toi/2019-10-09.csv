0,Garba organisers file petition in SC against 10 pm deadline,"VADODARA: Two city-based garba organisers filed a special leave petition in the Supreme Court on Tuesday against the order of the Gujarat High Court wherein the state government has prohibited the use of loudspeakers after 10 pm.

The Indu Health Research Foundation and the Way to Unity Trust, which organise the BITA-INDU garbas and the United Aarkie garba Mahotsav in the city, have jointly filed the petition.

The petition was filed in the SC through Delhi-based advocate D N Roy. Speaking to TNN, he said the SLP is filed to seek a relaxation against an order passed in a writ petition in the Gujarat High Court.

""In our petition we have said that Navratri is a religious and cultural festival that is traditionally celebrated at night and continues for nine nights. It is not recurring in nature,"" says Roy. ""We have further said that the state has already approached the central government for a relaxation of rules for celebrating religious festivals that are for a limited period.""

The petition states that for a state that has faced recurrent calamities such as the earthquake in 2001, the Godhra carnage and its aftermath and the recent Akshardham attack, its people need a festival to give vent to their emotions.

The petition also says that the SC order of 2000 was about a specific case of a church in Chennai, which used loudspeakers throughout the year. This does not pertain to festivals that are temporary in nature.

""We have to provide concrete evidence wherein the police have restrained garba organisers from use of loudspeakers after 10 pm. We have to therefore now produce the circulars issued by the Vadodara and Ahmedabad police in the hearing on Wednesday,"" he said.

Earlier, following a writ petition filed in the Gujarat High Court the state government had on October 4 stated in an affidavit that it would prohibit the use of loudspeakers after 10 pm. Roy said they are also requesting the SC''s opinion on whether the order of 2000 can be enforced for festivals.

1,"Don't be over-confident about polls, Keshubhai warns party","AHMEDABAD: Former chief minister Keshubhai Patel on Tuesday warned party leaders and workers not to be over-confident about the election prospects and said ""any form of arrogance"" would prove dangerous for the party in elections now due in the state.

The workers started clapping as Patel begun his speech at the ''Sankalp Baithak'' on the outskirts of Ahmedabad on Tuesday. ""The elections in Gujarat were a battle for life and death for the party and no stone should be left unturned. The party leaders should also not adopt partisan attitude for any individual or group as such attitude would again have an adverse effect on the poll outcome.""

Patel talked straight about the possible anti-establishment factor which, he said, should be taken care of or else the party would not be able to achieve good results in assembly elections and even the goal of 300 seats in Lok Sabha election in 2004. All eyes are on Gujarat and the party''s performance has to be better and effective, he said.

There should be no room for anti-establishment factor which, he said, had resulted in defeat in by-elections to Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabha last year. ""We should approach voters with politeness and assure them that the remaining work in their area would be completed in due course.""

Patel said leaders should evolve an effective poll strategy to trounce the Congress. Serious efforts would have to be made to capture traditional vote banks of the Congress while keeping the BJP support base intact.

He said all eyes were on Gujarat as the coming elections in the state would prove a turning point not only for the BJP but for whole nation. The state, he said, has always shown new direction to India.

Meanwhile, the workers convention adopted a political resolution assailing the Congress for its psuedo-secular stance which has widened the communal divide and cited the criticism of Godhra massacre and terrorist attack on Akshardham as glaring example in this direction.

Moving the resolution, Union textile minister Kashiram Rana lauded the action taken by the Modi government to control the communal riots and also for other achievements like release of Narmada waters and welfare measures for poor. State industries minister Suresh Mehta seconded the resolution which was passed unanimously at the session.

2,Gujarat polls acid test for BJP: Advani,"AHMEDABAD: Both deputy prime minister L K Advani and BJP president Venkaiah Naidu made it clear before party workers here on Tuesday that the repurcussions of the results of the assembly elections in Gujarat would be felt far beyond the state''s borders.

In fact, they told a ''Sankalp Baithak'', attended by nearly 7,000 BJP workers from all over the state, that winning Gujarat would be an ""acid test"" in the build-up to the 2004 general election.

The meeting was organised on Chief Minister Narendra Modi''s completion of a year in office. In fact, Modi and his Gaurav Yatra received a ringing endorsement from the BJP high command with Advani virtually setting at rest any intra-party rift, saying ""Modi is and will continue to be our chief minister.""

The central leaders asserted that Modi was the BJP''s best mascot in the state, signalling to party veterans Keshubhai Patel and Kashiram Rana to rally behind him.

Advani said he took pride in the fact that Modi was continuing as Gujarat''s chief minister even six months after the disssolution of the Assembly. Coming out in strong defence of the Gaurav Yatra, he hit out at Modi''s critics calling Gujarat ""Godse''s Gujarat"" and said the Gaurav Yatra was undertaken to restore the pride of the state after the Godhra incident and the violence in Ahmedabad which had given the state a bad name.

Stating that no efforts were made to control the 1984 riots in Delhi, Advani said in the case of Gujarat ""no other government took firm steps to bring the violence under control as Modi did.""

The deputy PM said that the BJP-led NDA alliance at the Centre was one of the best non-Congress coalitions and even if the BJP bags 300 seats in the next Lok Sabha election, the coalition would continue on the basis of the common programme.

""The present NDA coalition, with 23 constituents, represents the nation geographically and socially and, therefore, this system should be further strengthened with the help and co-operation of the partners to accelerate the pace of development,"" Advani said.

Advani made it clear that the BJP has accepted the principles of coalition in the larger interest of the nation and the decision had yielded desired results.

""The BJP is committed to cultural nationalism and we have not deviated from our ideals while supporting the programmes and policies of NDA,"" he said. Advani said that the concept of theocratic state, like that of Pakistan, would not have succeeded in India.

Advani said the Gujarat Gaurav Yatra was not aimed at saving the BJP but to save the pride of Gujarat which was hurt by campaign of pseudo-secular elements.

Naidu said winning the Gujarat polls would be a step towards securing majority in next Lok Sabha election in 2004 by winning more than 300 seats. ""The BJP and its allies should get absolute majority so that the coalition government could take effective decisions in the Lok Sabha as well the Rajya Sabha. At present, we do not have majority in the Rajya Sabha and had to suffer defeat on several occasions, including in the passage of Poto.""

Naidu warned the party functionaries not to be over-confident but to work hard to spread the party''s message among the masses and expose ""the double-speak of the psuedo-secularism of the Congress and Left parties"". The BJP, he said, was committed to its idealogy and programmes but in no way should they be thrust upon the NDA coalition.

Lashing out at the Congress and the Left, Naidu said that they were responsible for adding to the communal divide in the country with the sole aim of grabbing power. The Congress, he said, has no more remained the Congress of original leaders and has fallen back on outsiders like Shankarsinh Vaghela.

Naidu said in Gujarat elections would be held before the onset of the new year and the announcement for the election schedule was expected in next couple of days. Only deserving workers would be given tickets on the basis of their track record but those denied tickets should not raise hue and cry and damage the party.

4,Opium smuggler’s arrest haunts Bathinda politicians,"BATHINDA: Many political leaders of the area are reportedly having obsessive opium dreams. Itâ€™s not that they are addicted, but fear certainly becoming increasingly addictive for this charmed tribe.

The man giving them recurrent jitters in even their dreams is none other than the famous opium smuggler Raj Modar, whose dramatic surrender before a court here on Saturday, has sparked off anxiety attacks the political establishment. Some these politicians are now mortally afraid of damaging disclosures once the police manages to get Morad to speak up on his influential links.

The police had been trying to nab Modar, who is known for his proximity with a former minister and a Member of Parliament, after the Congress came to power, but without much success. He gave up after court ordered attachment of his property worth several lakhs last month.

On Tuesday, the Bathinda police took Modar on remand till October 16. The police is believed to have been interrogating him about his links with the leaders of the SADBJP government under whose alleged patronage he was doing vigorous business of opium and poppy husk in Punjab and Haryana.

Raj Modar was in the police net on December 6, 2000 when the Bathinda police seized a truck (Number RJ-31-G-2429) carrying 75 kg opium worth over Rs 10 lakh.

After a tip-off the police seized the opium at a naka and arrested Karamjit Singh and Charanjit Singh, the driver and cleaner of the truck.

The interrogation of the duo reportedly revealed that the opium consignment belonged to Raj Modar, a transporter of Rampura Phool town of Bathinda.

But Modar managed to get off easily after a cabinet minister and a Member of Parliament came to his rescue and the police was reportedly asked to reinvestigate the role of Modar in the opium case. And expectedly, the inquiry abdicated Raj Modar of charges. The driver and cleaner of the truck were booked under the NDPS Act.

Once the government in the state changed, the Bathinda police reopened the opium case and found Modar the main culprit in the case.

If during the Akalis regime Modar was moving freely, for the last seven months he was on the run after the police started a move to arrest him.

Recently, a court at Bathinda declared Modar a proclaimed offender and ordered the attachment of his property which resulted in Modar giving up before the court.

The police here believes that the interrogation of Modar would help expose the nexus between some former ministers, political leaders and smugglers who had made this area virtually a den of drug smugglers. Suspecting that Modarâ€™s â€˜â€˜confessionâ€™â€™ could get many bigwig into trouble, the political leaders are worried and running helter-skelter.

A senior police officer told Times News Network that during the last seven months the area police had arrested about a dozen big smugglers, including a SGPC member and a police officer who were flourishing with more than a little help from the political leaders of SAD-BJP government.

5,Why Naik opposes disinvestment?,"NEW DELHI: Ram Naik needs a PSU prop in his home state, Maharashtra. And that''s probably one more reason, other than ""national interest"", why he does not want the government to let go of the units under his control.

The minister has already got Indian Oil to build an under-sea pipeline to supply drinking water to remote villages in his constituency in north Mumbai. He also got the Oil and Natural Gas Commission (ONGC) to light up some villages in the state using photo-electric lanterns.

Now, it''s the turn of the public sector oil major Hindustan Petroleum Company Limited (HPCL) to run community kitchens in the village of Agwan in Palghar taluka of Maharashtra.

The experimental project was launched after Naik adopted the village, following a devastating flood earlier this year.

Naik finds nothing wrong in getting the PSUs to lend a helping hand for community projects. After all, oil PSUs do a lot of good things as part of their social obligation, these are just a few of the cases, he maintains.

The innovative kitchen experiment involves setting up four cylinders and 14 burners with HPCL providing the fuel and the basic infrastructure. The womenfolk are required to bring cooking articles and cook for about 30 minutes after making a meagre payment of Rs 3, thereby enabling the oil company to recover its costs.

""There is no operational burden on the oil company,"" Naik says.

6,Punjab govt opposed to Centre’s tax move,"PATIALA: The Punjab government has strongly opposed the Central governmentâ€™s move to provide only four per cent instead of 11.5 per cent taxes to be collected through the sale of paddy.

This was stated here by Punjab food supply and finance minister Lal Singh while talking to mediapersons at Sanaur on Tuesday. He said that this policy went against the development works in the state.

Expressing his dissatisfaction over the bonus of Rs 20 per quintal of paddy to the farmers, he said the Central government would be pressurised to give genuine rate to the farmers for their yield and the state government had decided to discuss the issue in a special house of the Punjab Vidhan Sabha on October 11, 2002.

He said that the SAD (Badal) and the BJP should join the special assembly session if they claimed to be farmersâ€™ friends.

Replying to a question in this regard, he said that the Central government had not issued any letter so far but as soon as the state government received intimation it would start making the payment along with the payment of the procured yield.

He said that the farmers were not being given genuine rates for their yield which was being brought to the mandis at an additional cost of Rs 400 crore in the form of power purchased at high rates to irrigate crop.

The minister said that this year only 100 lakh MT paddy was expected to reach mandis, which was 5 lakh MT less than that of last year. He said in the first week of procurement between October 1 and October 7 procurement agencies and private traders procured 28 lakh MT of paddy.

While the FCI procured 29.1 per cent, the private agencies procured 15.5 per cent of the total arrival, he added.

To clear the 75 per cent payment of the procured yield, the state government had made arrangements for Rs 6,000 crore from the Reserve Bank of India out of which the bank had released Rs 4,000 crore.

Patiala deputy commissioner Tejveer Singh said that by October 7, food and supply department had procured 19,965 MT of paddy, PUNSUP 28,328 MT, Markfed 19,840 MT, Ware House Corporation 14,386 MT, Punjan Agro 10103 MT, FCI 12,940 MT and private traders 10,346 MT from the different mandis of this district.

A report from Fatehgarh Sahib said that 1,05,596 MT of paddy was purchased till Monday evening in the district, which is more than 25 per cent of the total purchase, and procurement process had been going on smoothly at all the 35 purchase centres.

He said that the food and supply department had procured 16,442 MT, Markfed 22,575 MT, PUNSUP 24,304 MT, Ware House 13,592 MT, Punjab Agro 14,112 MT, FCI 13,190 MT. The traders purchased 1,381 MT of paddy till Monday evening in the district. He told that 80 per cent of the total purchase of paddy had been lifted.

The DC also made surprise visits to various purchase centres in Sirhind, Bassi Pathana, Chunni Kalan, Amloh and Khumano grain markets and found that the purchase agencies were performing well.

7,Legal community is split over Salman re-arrest,"MUMBAI: City legal experts are divided over the rearrest of actor Salman Khan without getting his bail cancelled in the hit and run case. Salman was arrested on October 5 on the charge of rash and negligent driving which resulted in the death of a man and caused injury to four others sleeping in front of a bakery in Bandra. He was released on a bail of Rs 950. On Moday, he was rearrested under section 304 (ii) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) on the charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder, which is non-bailable. This section is applied when an accused has fore-knowledge that an act committed by him/ her was likely to cause death. Criminal lawyers say that the fresh arrest of an accused in the same incident is permitted if evidence disloses a more serious offence. Noting that a particular charge can be added at any time by the police till the trial is completed, criminal lawyer Shrikant Bhat said Salmanâ€™s â€œre-arrest on the same criminal complaint is justified and necessary.â€™â€™ He said cancellation of the previous bail was not required as he was arrested again for a different offence. Criminal counsel P.R.Vakil also said, â€œIn order to arrest Salman Khan for a non-bailable offence it was not essential for the police to apply first to the magistrate to cancel the order of the earlier bail given by police themselves. After the second arrest the police is bound to produce him before a magistrate who decides whether to grant bail or not and the police at that time should apply for cancellation of the earlier bail.â€™â€™ Criminal lawyer Mahesh Jethmalani said Salmanâ€™s re-arrest was not necessary at all. â€œAn accident case can never amount to culpable homicide not amounting to murder,â€™â€™ he observed. However, several lawyers felt that the previous bail had to first be cancelled before an accused is arrested again. Advocate Abad Ponda who had represented Salman in the Bombay high court said, â€œEven if there is fresh evidence, the police should have moved a higher court for the cancellation of his earlier bail.â€™â€™ He said judicial pronouncements on the interpretation of the Criminal Procedure Code provide that even if the second offence is more serious and non-bailable, the police need to move a court to cancel the bail before arresting. Senior counsel Shirish Gupte added, â€œOnce a man is released on bail, to arrest him again in the same incident, the bail should be cancelled. The police cannot suo motu cancel the bail.â€™â€™ Lawyers are also debating the applicability of section 304 (ii) of the IPC in Salmanâ€™s case. Some lawyers pointed out serious accidents, which occurred in the past on the city streets, including the one in which a bus mowed down 15-odd school children, had not attracted section 304. Mr Gupte and Mr Bhat said it was premature to say if section 304 (ii) can be invoked against Salman.

8,PPCC media spokesman commits suicide,"LUDHIANA: Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee (PPCC) media spokesperson Manjit Singh Malerkotla committed suicide here on Monday night at his brotherâ€™s residence.

It is learnt that Manjit Singh had consumed sulphur and was taken to Mohan Dai Oswal Cancer Hospital, where he breathed his last at 11:30 pm.

The PPCC office-bearer, who hailed from Malerkotla, had paralysed legs since birth and also suffered from depression, said some of the senior politicians of Ludhiana. He lived in Manekwala village on Dhandara road in Ludhiana district. He frequently visited his brother Tarsem Chand at whose place he committed suicide. His brother lives in Bhagwan Nagar near Dholewal.

Tarsem Chand said that he refused to be taken to the hospital once it was learnt that he had consumed poison.

A suicide note was recovered from him in which he mentioned his wish to be cremated by Ludhiana District Congress Committee president K K Bawa. This is a strange request as he is survived by three sons and a daughter. SP (City II) Naunihal Singh said that the police had not yet ascertained that the handwriting matched with that of Manjit Singh.

At 46, Manjit Singh was ousted by the Congress for joining the Lok Bhalai party. Later, he came back to the Congress. It is learnt that he was unsuccessful in most of the business ventures that he began and his handicap made the matters worse propelling him towrards depression. If rumours circulating amongst the Congress politicians in the city on Tuesday are to be believed then Manjit Singh was not on good terms with chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh.

Requesting anonymity, a Congress politician said that Manjit Singh had approached CM several times with his views and problems but the latter always refused to listen to him.

9,Badal trying to delay SGPC polls: Amarinder,"CHANDIGARH: Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh has categorically denied that he ever interfered in the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) elections or in the affairs of Durgiana temple.

On the contrary, he accused SAD president Parkash Singh Badal of conspiring with the Centre to delay the SGPC elections.

Countering Badalâ€™s charge that the government had been victimising pro-Badal SGPC members, Amarinder said that the law would take its own course and none involved in illegal activities like drug-trafficking and rape would be spared.

The chief minister assured that no innocent person would ever be harassed during his tenure and detailed instructions had been issued in this regard.

Describing Badalâ€™s allegation that the government was interfering in religious affairs as â€˜â€˜baseless and highly misleadingâ€�, Amarinder said here on Tuesday in a statement that the Congress never meddled in religious affairs.

He said that Badal had levelled such allegations fearing his impending defeat in the SGPC elections as he stood totally exposed. The SGPC elections are expected to be held next year.

Amarinder said that the Akalis had been misusing religion to promote themselves politically and the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) was a â€˜â€˜party of fundamentalistsâ€�.

Alleging that Badal was engaged in maintaining his stronghold on the SGPCâ€™s resources, he said, â€˜â€˜Badal is using his political clout with the Centre to stall the SGPC elections, which should have been held this November.â€™â€™

10,Decomposed body of lawyer found in Mandiaon,"LUCKNOW: A lawyer practising at the Lucknow Bench of the Allahabad High Court was found murdered at his residence in Mandiaon late on Monday night. The decomposed body of the victim, Brijesh Misra (38), suggested that he was killed four days ago. The police suspect that the murder was a result of a robbery attempt in which the victim was assaulted by robbers when he offered resistance. Family members of the deceased have alleged that the incident may be an outcome of old enmity.

The incident came to light around 11 pm on Monday when Vinod Kumar Rastogi returned to his house in sector F area of Jankipuram after a five-day trip to Fatehpur and informed the police.

While the ground floor of the house was left untouched, on the first floor, the latches on the doors were found broken.

The police suspect that Brijesh was murdered during a robbery bid.

Meanwhile, the younger brother of the victim, Ajay Misra said that Brijesh was named as accused in a murder case which took place in Sidhauli area of Sitapur in 1992 and this was a result of the subsequent enmity.

11,Sonia to meet party workers at grass-roots on Oct 10,"LUCKNOW: Sonia Gandhi will begin the much-awaited â€˜Karyakarta samvaadâ€™ (direct interaction) programme from Mathura on October 10. It will be a day-long programme, said the UPCC spokesperson Akhilesh Pratap Singh, in which the Congress president will meet with party workers at grass -roots level, as well as with representatives from different sections of the society.

Around 1400 participants would be taking part in the Mathura meet from the Agra zone of the Congress, said Singh. The event assumes greater significance he pointed out, because probably for the first time, the interaction will be carried out without the presence of the special protection group which has already been directed to keep a distance when the programme is on.

Sonia will not confine herself to lending an ear to the workers woes and problems. This time Sonia proposes to meet various delegations from the general public to have a first-hand account of local issues. Slated to have an audience with her are ulemas and imams representing the minority community and other religious leaders along with representatives from amongst farmers, NGOs, intelligentsia, environmentalists, traders and industrialists.

She has also fixed up a meeting with a delegation of Vrindavan widows, said Singh. UPCC president Arun Kumar Singh Munna and the party in-charge Moti Lal Vora are already camping at Mathura. Soniaâ€™s visit to other districts in the state will also follow the same pattern.

12,"Blame low budget for bad roads, PWD minister tells CM","KOLKATA: â€œIf you see potholed roads during the Pujas, do not blame me but the stingy finance department,â€� an angry PWD minister Amar Choudhury reportedly told Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee during a meeting recently.

Finance minister Asim Dasguptaâ€™s austerity drive is likely to leave its adverse mark on the Kolkata roads and Choudhury has been fuming over Dasguptaâ€™s â€˜close-fisted approachâ€™.

â€œI am not happy with the road conditions during the Pujas and I told the CM about the fund problem,â€™â€™ Choudhury told TNN.

In his note to the chief minister, Choudhury complained that the current budget allocation for road maintenance was slashed to just one fourth of the allocation made last year.

All roads and bridge construction activity in the plan sector have almost come to halt with the finance department stopping fund flow.

Constructions related to development projects in the health, police, judicial and jail departments have also suffered.

The Centreâ€™s share of funds for several projects cannot be utilised fully by the year end as the state finance department has not been releasing the proportionate amount.

Files relating to the relocation of PWD offices are also stranded in the finance department.

This has delayed the setting up of offices for the West Bengal Corridor Development Project and Pradhanmantri Gram Sarak Rojgar Yojna,

The finance minister has also dismantled the system of issuing letters of credit every month in a bid to bring financial discipline in the PWD and PHE.

Choudhury has resented the abolition of this â€˜easy systemâ€™ of payment.

He said that work in districts was affected badly due to the new practice of collecting huge payments from districts and embargo on work till the receipt of allotment orders.

13,RSP blasts govt for isolating people,"KOLKATA: The RSP, a major partner of the CPM in the ruling Left Front, came out with a white paper on Monday, lambasting the performance of the state government and criticising the role of the Front itself, saying that the Left-coalition was ignoring struggle and was becoming increasingly dependent on bureaucracy.

Issued by the state committee of the RSP, the 28-page booklet, which was handed over to Front chairman Biman Bose and all Left Front constituents, also criticised the CPM for its insistence on joining hands with the Congress to fight the BJP and the sangh parivar. Pointing out the failures of the Left Front government, â€œwhich were antagonising and isolating a large number of people from the Left campâ€�, the RSP said, poor performance of the government in education, health and power sectors were tarnishing the image of the Front. The RSP also said:

Panchayats in the villages are being captured by utterly corrupt people belonging to the Left parties.

In the name of decentralization, the zilla parishads (all of them controlled by the CPM) have concentrated powers in their own hands.

The state governmentâ€™s policy of recruiting teachers on contractual basis will, instead of improving the standard of education, only deteriorate it.

There are acute infrastructural deficiencies in hospitals, both in the cities and districts. These are leading to frequent outbursts of peopleâ€™s anger as had happened at BC Roy childrenâ€™s hospital recently.

A section of police officials are hand-in-glove with criminals. This is tarnishing the image of the Left Front.

Repeated hike in electricity charges have antagonised a large section of the people. The state government should immediately review its power policy.

Torture of Razabazar Science College teacher Kaushik Ganguli on charges of his links with the Naxalite Peoplesâ€™ War is condemnable.

North Bengal districts have been neglected for long, leading to the rise of Kamtapuri separatists.

The RSP also said in its document that the CPMâ€™s policy of aligning with the Congress to fight the BJP was adversely affecting unity among the Left in the entire country.

14,Court seeks details of govt hospital handover to private body,"KOLKATA: How can a government district hospital be handed over to a private nursing home without any benefit to the general public? The Calcutta High Court has asked Burdwan Zilla Parishad to clarify the agreement made between them and the private company to whom they handed the hospital over.

The court has further directed additional government pleader Debasish Kargupta to take necessary instruction on the matter from the state government and file a supplementary affidavit before it.

A division bench comprising chief justice AK Mathur and justice Jayanta Kumar Biswas passed the order last Friday on a public interest litigation filed by Burdwan District Consumer Protection Welfare Centre challenging the decision of the Burdwan Zilla Parishad to handover the district hospital at Bamchadpur, Burdwan. In 1989 the West Bengal government had sanctioned Rs.1.77 crore for construction of a district hospital at Bamchadpur in Burdwan. Subsequently the building was constructed.

In February, 2000, former health minister Partha Dey by issuing a memorandum had handed over the hospital to the Burdwan Zilla Parishad so that the Parishad or any other registered society could run it. Interestingly the zilla parishad without any tender simply handed over the hospital to a private company, Ananya Health Care.

Appearing on behalf of the petitioner, advocate Pratik Dhar submitted that the zilla parishad handed over the hospital to the private company on the condition that only 10 per cent of the beds would be free, whereas 90 per cent would be in the hands of the private company.

This would frustrate the entire concept of health welfare for poorer section in the district of Burdwan. The agreement has been done without any public notification.

15,CPI(ML) calls Bihar govt anti-poor,"BEGUSARAI: ""Whether we succeed or not but the demand of the country is to put up a joint secular front by Left and other secular parties to defeat the communal forces which are bent upon breaking the secular fabric of the country"", said the national general secretary of CPI(ML), Dipankar Bhattacharya. The CPI(ML) national general secretary was addressing a Nav Jagran rally organised by the district unit of his party here at the local Gandhi Stadium on Monday. Criticising the economic policy of the Union government which has resulted in the closure of various public sector undertakings including the Barauni unit of Hindustan Fertiliser Corporation (HFC), the CPI(ML) leader called upon the people to launch an agitation otherwise the days are not far off when the Barauni refinery would also be closed down. Lambasting the Union government for denying any package to Bihar after the bifurcation of state, Bhattarcharya said that his party would extend support the state on the issue of development. He said that if the people do not adopt the course of agitation against the Union and the state government, no industry except one of kidnapping and crime would flourish here. Blaming the state government for being anti-poor and anti-development, Dipankar offered help to any secular party which will work for state''s development. He said CPI(ML) would welcome and cooperate even if at the state level all Left parties from a joint front. Without naming the CPM, Bhattarcharya said that the Left party supporting the state government is also involved in various cases of atrocities being committed upon the poor in the state. He said Bihar still have landlords who possess more than thousand acres of land. He said that the representatives of various bodies constituted after the panchayat elections are being denied constitutional powers resulting in the corruption in various schemes. The meet was presided over by the district secretary of the party Chandra Deo Verma. Prior to the meeting, the ML supporter took out a procession which passed through the main thoroughfares of the town.

16,CPM protests rape of Dalit woman,"SAMASTIPUR: The CPM organised demonstrations at Patailiya village under the Bibhutipur block of the district on Sunday, protesting against the alleged rape of a Dalit woman of the village, Janki Devi. Janki, CPM supporters alleged, was raped by the mukhiya of the village Rishideo Singh and his son Sanjeev Singh.

17,"Joshi says NITs will be apolitical, professional","NEW DELHI: HRD minister Murli Manohar Joshi on Tuesday said the managements of the 17 National Institutes of Technology (NITs), as also the IIMs and IITs, would be kept â€˜â€˜strictly apolitical and professionalâ€™â€™.

The institutes would continue to have professional autonomy â€˜â€˜so that the high standards expected of them are maintainedâ€™â€™, Joshi told the consultative committee of Parliament attached to the HRD ministry.

The management would be by boards of governors at the institute level, while a council of NITs, as in the case of the IITs, would oversee their work at the national level. Fifty per cent of the seats would be reserved for the states concerned.

Joshi said five of the NITs were in the pipeline with regional engineering colleges (RECs) being upgraded and given deemed university status. While the RECs were controlled both by the Centre and state, the NITs would have professional management. This was â€˜â€˜a conscious decisionâ€™â€™, he told the MPs. The NITs would have linkages with the IIMs, the IITs and the industry to make the research and training relevant to current needs.

The consultative committee also dealt with the issue of malnutrition. It needed to be addressed urgently by placing the programmes in the â€˜â€˜mission modeâ€™â€™. The National Nutrition Mission would be headed by the Prime Minister and its executive committee by the HRD minister.

18,Electricity board staff to protest suspension of employees,"PATNA: At least a hundred Bihar State Electricity Board (BSEB) employees continued their agitation inside its headquarters, Vidyut Bhavan, on the second day on Tuesday under the banner of the National Co-ordination Committee of Electricity Employees and Engineers.

Around 11.20 am several third and fourth grade employees started raising slogans in the Vidyut Bhavan against the BSEB management in protest against the suspension of 15 employees and to press their other demands.

The management had requisitioned additional police force for deployment on its premises as a precautionary measure. BSEB guards along with the police virtually fortified the first floor of the building, where the chambers of all the top officials are located. The DM and ADM (law and order) visited the premises to take stock of the situation.

BSEB sources said all the agitating employees were forced to vacate the premises before the lunch recess. The BSEB has already issued suspension letters to all the 15 employees. â€œWe have not revoked the suspension of any employee,â€� said an official.

Coordination committee representative Chakradhar Prasad Singh said following its emergency meeting on Tuesday evening, it issued an ultimatum to the BSEB to withdraw the suspension orders in 48 hours. â€œWe will resort to complete strike in Patna any day after Thursday if the government fails to release our money by that time,â€� he maintained, adding that the final decision will be taken on Thursday. Power Engineering Service Association secretary B L Yadav said the energy minister will be responsible if any untoward incident takes place.

20,CBI arrests BSNL employee for taking bribe,"PUNE: A technical assistant of the Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) was arrested by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) while accepting a bribe of Rs 500 from an STD booth owner.

According to CBI officials, technical assistant Nitin Belgaonkar, who is currently posted at Kamshet, was approached by Datta Dalvi, who had applied for an STD booth.

For clearing the proposal, Belgaonkar allegedly demanded a bribe of Rs 2,000. Finally, the amount was fixed at Rs 1,000, of which Rs 500 would be paid before the sanctioning of the booth.

After Dalvi was allotted the booth, Belgaonkar approached him and demanded the remaining amount. Refusing to give in, Dalvi lodged a complaint with the CBI''s anti-corruption wing in Mumbai.

The CBI then laid a trap at Belgaonkar''s office on Monday afternoon and arrested him red-handed.

In subsequent searches carried out by CBI authorities at Belgaonkar''s flat in Yamunanagar, Nigdi, fixed deposit receipts worth Rs 50,000 were confiscated. Property-related documents were also seized.

Belgaonkar was produced in the court of special judge for anti-corruption cases, Ashwinikumar Deore, on Tuesday. He has been remanded to CBI custody till October 11.

21,National Defence Academy protests constructions around campus,"PUNE: Although a boundary wall is being constructed for the National Defence Academy (NDA) here, authorities at the training institute said they would continue to remind civic officials and the state government about the construction-rule violations around NDA campus.

Speaking to reporters after laying the foundation stone of the wall, NDA commandant Air Marshal A.K. Trikha said he will continue to rake up the issue of mushrooming constructions. ""What happens in the periphery of the NDA''s campus does concern us,"" Trikha said.

The commandant, however, refused to comment on the pending litigations on the number of alleged illegal constructions on the stretch between Chandni chowk and NDA main gate.

""We have always taken up these issues with the state government and the local administration too,"" Trikha said, adding that his officials had raised the matter at the September 28 meeting of the civil-military co-ordination committee, chaired by state chief secretary V. Ranganathan.

Giving details of the meeting, administration incharge Col. S.G. Balutagi said civil authorities were apprised of the fact that residents of Ahire village continue to occupy land acquired by the NDA. ""The NDA has already paid Rs 47 lakh through the district collector towards compensation for the displaced villagers. The NDA has also provided alternative land at New Ahire village to the villagers.

Col. Balutagi said the civil officials were reminded that the NDA occupied only 6,700 acres of land, although on paper it was supposed to have 8,000 acres.

Meanwhile, Trikha said he is confident that the money for the wall construction project would be released as work progresses. Trikha''s assertion is important as the defence ministry has released only Rs 2 crore out of the estimated Rs 6.21 crore needed to construct the 35-km wall. ""Now that the project has been approved in principle, there should be no problem,"" Trikha affirmed.

The boundary wall will be constructed in two phases. The first phase will cover a 8.58-km stretch between Pashan and MES Gate. The second phase will include a 7.6-km wall and 15.11-km-long chain-link fence.

22,Delhi markets to stay open till 10 pm,"NEW DELHI: There is some good news for shoppers. From next week, markets in Delhi will remain open till 10 pm. The Delhi state Cabinet on Tuesday endorsed the proposal to stagger shopping timings by allowing markets to remain open till 10 pm. The move is experimental to begin with. The market associations will be allowed to keep their shops open till 10 pm for three months. If it is taken well by traders, the state government will permanently alter the closing time for all prominent markets in the city. Having endorsed the proposal, the state Cabinet has now sent it to lieutenant governor Vijai Kapoor for his approval. State industry and labour minister Deep Chand Bandhu said the proposal has been discussed at all levels in the government and would soon come into force. He said the decision was taken in view of the coming festivals, the start of the tourist season and the prevailing economic recession. â€˜â€˜There is a need to boost commercial activities in the city. Keeping the markets open longer will not only enhance sales but also make shopping more convenient for people with late working hours,â€™â€™ Bandhu said. He said the state labour department would ensure that the working hours prescribed in the Delhi Shops and Establishment Act were followed by the shopowners. â€˜â€˜Workers employed at these shops should not be made to work for more than eight hours. The shopowners will have to pay overtime if they are made to work beyond the prescribed hours,â€™â€™ he said. Bandhu said it was up to shopowners to decide on the opening time for their markets.

23,Cong pins hopes on Mufti to form govt,"NEW DELHI: The Congress is keeping its fingers crossed on the eve of results in Jammu and Kashmir. The party expects to be in with a chance to form government with a post-poll alliance with the People''s Democratic Party and independents.

With all indications that the 87-member J&K Assembly is headed for a hung verdict, the Congress will tie up with Mufti Mohammad Sayeed''s PDP and independents in the Valley to stake claim if the numbers add up. Party leaders said they expect to get about 25 seats, about 22 of them from Jammu, where it contested all 37 seats.

In the Valley, though there were no tie-ups, the party expects to cash in on pre-poll magnanimity. It did not put up candidates in 10 constituencies in the Valley, leaving them for nominees of the PDP and independents. In Anantnag, for instance, the party has not contested as many as five seats.

""We have several options open to us. Depending on numbers we will attempt to form government with the support of independents and other like-minded parties. We did not put up candidates against (Mufti''s daughter) Mehbooba and some other PDP candidates and independents who we thought had a better chance of defeating the National Conference,"" party spokesman Jaipal Reddy said.

Asked whether these Independents included separatist leaders who had quit the Hurriyat Conference to contest elections, Reddy said: ""All those who stood for elections swore by the Constitution. So if they are like-minded, we could join hands with them.""

Officially the party will just say that it expects to ""improve its performance dramatically"" from the four seats in the outgoing Assembly. The feedback from the state leadership, however, suggests a close race with the National Conference.

""The NC is still likely to be the single largest party, with the Congress a close second"", said a senior party leader. A tentative break-up suggests about 30-35 seats for the NC, 22-27 for the Congress, about 10 for the PDP and less than five for the BJP.

The party leadership feels the BJP will be more or less decimated in the state. ""They will be lucky if they get two seats"", said a leader, adding that the rival party''s performance would be affected by it''s wrangles with poll partner Jammu State Morcha and the rift over the trifurcation issue.

Senior leader Ambika Soni, who campaigned extensively for the party in the state, feels the Congress is likely to do well for several other reasons. ""People wanted a change of regime but did not have the confidence that it could happen. The role of the Election Commission in instilling that confidence, along with Ghulam Nabi Azad''s efforts, gave reason for them to believe that there was an alternative.""

Also, Soni said, the Congress president not heeding written instructions of the home ministry and the SPG, and going ahead to address meetings at Srinagar and Jammu ""definitely gave the Congress campaign the profile it needed."" Sonia''s speech in Srinagar, she said, was almost like a policy statement on J&K.

Soni also said that though there were no pre-poll alliances, the Congress'' resurgence as well as its gesture of not putting up candidates to ensure an NC defeat ""gave an important message for an Opposition campaign."" Added a leader: ""The general feeling prevailed among independents, regional parties and the Congress that there was a link"".

24,SC sets aside election of Humnabad MLA,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court has set aside the election of Karnataka legislator Subhash Kallur, elected from the Humnabad constituency, on the ground that on the date of polling, he had a contract with the government for a construction on Right Bank canal.

Allowing defeated candidate Rajasekhar Basavaraj Patil''s appeal, a bench comprising justice M B Shah and justice D M Dharmadhikari directed its registry to send the necessary intimation to the Election Commission and the assembly Speaker.

Kallur had contended that he had written to the state government almost a month before the September 5, 1999, election for the termination of the contract.

However, the bench pointed out that his application for the termination of the contract was accepted only in September 2000 and thus the contract subsisted on the date of election, as a result of which he was disqualified to contest the poll.

Setting aside the Karnataka High Court order upholding the election of Kallur, the Bench said: ``On appreciation of documentary and oral evidence on record, we find that the high court committed a serious error in coming to the conclusion that...there was a unilateral or bilateral termination of the contract.''''

25,Tamil Sangam agonised over Tamil channel `bandh',"BANGALORE: Expressing `agony'' at the non-telecast of Tamil channels in Karnataka, the Bangalore Tamil Sangam has submitted a memorandum to Chief Minister Krishna, asking him to ensure that the ``usual life of Tamils in Karnataka is not disturbed.''''

The Sangam has pointed out in the memorandum, a copy of which was released to the press, that Tamils in Karnataka have always cooperated with Kannadigas. ``Tamil people living in Mysore, Kollegal and Satyamangalam are participating in the ongoing agitation for the demands of Karnataka people in Cauvery water affairs. It is very sorrowful to see and hear that whenever Cauvery water crisis arises, Tamil minorities are put to great harassment resulting in calamities of such as property destruction, death and torture, which is bad for democratic society and the integration of the nation,'''' they have maintained.

They appealed to the governments of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu to undertake joint efforts to solve the problem with guidelines from the Centre, keeping in mind the interests of farmers from both states.

``It is great agony to see that due to the Cauvery crises, telecast of Tamil TV channels were discontinued, which is against fundamental rights. We earnestly request you to see that the Cauvery agitation will not turn against safety and property of Tamils in Karnataka and also not to disturb the usual life of Tamils by cutting telecast of Tamil channels,'''' the memorandum added.

26,Juhapura tense after builder's arrest,"AHMEDABAD: Tension prevailed in the city''s sensitive Juhapura area on Wednesday evening following the arrest of Nazir Vohra, a local builder who was absconding for quite some time.

According to the Vejalpur police, Vohra is believed to have close links with gangster Abdul Wahab, who is under trial for several serious offences, including extortions and murders. Police have been on the look-out for Vohra for allegedly brewing trouble during the recent communal riots.

According to senior police officials, there are about 14 cases pending against Vohra, including the murder of a camel-cart driver and charges of rioting during the communal unrest. The accused was also allegedly involved in several extortion rackets and was a TADA detainee.

It was alleged that the accused had even planned an attack on Vejalpur police station during the riots. Vohra is also accused of land-grabbing in the area, where his illegal business was thriving. But nothing concrete against him has been found by the police so far. As the news of his arrest spread, people started closing down their shops in the area.

Police said they would seek the remand of the accused for at least a week to interrogate him in connection with the pending cases against him. He would be presented before a metropolitan court on Thursday.

27,Panna-Mukta: BG top brass seek govt help,"NEW DELHI: British oil and gas major BG group on Wednesday sought the government''s help to prevail over ONGC and Reliance in giving it the operatorship of Tapti gas and Panna-Mukta oil and gas fields.

BG group non-executive chairman Richard Giordano and CEO Frank Chapman flew in here from London to make a case for British Gas being handed over management control of the offshore fields, where BG, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation and Reliance were together losing about Rs 1.5 crore a day by way of unrealised production potential on account of under-performance while the partners squabble over operatorship.

While Chapman, after a 50-minute meeting with Petroleum Minister Ram Naik, said BG was for maximising value of investment for the government and the partners, Naik on his part asked BG to settle the row with the partners by the month-end.

Naik said additional investment of $300-400 million to expand the Tapti gas field could yield additional 6 million standard cubic metre per day of gas over the present production of 7.5 mmscmd.

""My eagerness is that they (partners) should come to an understanding at the earliest. We are interested in additional gas which can only come when the operatorship issue is resolved and partners agree for additional investments,"" he told reporters after the meeting.

Naik, however, made it clear BG, ONGC and Reliance were equally capable of operating the field and management of field cannot pass to anyone of them without the others agreeing to it.

The BG top brass are scheduled to meet senior officials of ONGC and RIL on Thursday.

Chapman, on his second visit since BG bought over Enron Oil and Gas India Ltd''s 30 per cent stake in the 27,000 barrels per day oil and gas field, tried to impress upon Naik the need to put an ""efficient and highly professional"" BG in the driver''s seat at the offshore oil fields to maximise value for all stakeholders including government.

""We are mostly interested in the best solution to create greater value for the people of India and the partners,"" he told reporters after meeting Naik but declined to give details of discussions.

Giordano said he was hopeful of an early solution to the issue and his meeting with Naik and partners on Thursday was a step towards that.

""Their plea is that they should get the operatorship (of the field). I told them this is a commercial issue and they should try to come to agreement so that everyone can invest more in development plan,"" Naik said.

The issue is deadlocked since March when BG had agreed to jointly operate the field along with ONGC and RIL. BG has rejected the joint management model proposed by ONGC-RIL combine which suggested giving ONGC the chief executive officer''s post while delegating the chief operating officer''s (COO) job to BG. RIL, according to the model, would have claim on the post of chief finance officer (CFO).

Instead, it has asked ONGC and RIL, who have 40 and 30 per cent equity interest respectively, to nominate it to manage the field, a term which the Indian partners find unacceptable.

Chapman said BG had already invested $500 million in India and had lined up further investment.

As a last ditch effort to resolve the operatorship issue, Chapman and Giordano would meet ONGC chairman and managing director Subir Raha over lunch on Thursday and would soon after fly to Mumbai to meet the top brass of Reliance Industries.

Refusing to take sides, Naik expressed hope that the three partners would agree on an operatorship model before the October 31 deadline set by him.

Sources said BG has suggested that the partners nominate it as the operator of the field for it had the ""capability of operating the field in the most transparent and efficient manner that would bring most value to all the stakeholders including the government"".

The British company has sought to involve the Indian partners by way of giving them administrative opportunities like communications and housing, they said.

BG cannot become an operator unless appointed by the joint managing committee, comprising the three partners, or by the government under the clauses of production sharing contract signed for the field.

With RIL, which has 30 per cent stake in the field, siding with ONGC (40 per cent interest), BG would lose at JMC.

28,IHM permitted to increase seats in first yr batch,"CHANDIGARH: The Institute of Hotel Management (IHM) has taken permission from the All India Council of Technical Education (AICTE) and the ministry of tourism to increase the number of seats in the first year batch to 187 from the previous 150.

This is a one-time exception. First year students at the college who had taken the final exams in April-May 2002 had complained that many amongst them had failed and the college was to blame for it. They had raised a furore, which eventually died down when the college disclosed the facts to the parents and the ministry officials who realised that the fault was with the students who had not been attending classes.

Later, parents and students had requested that the failed students be allowed to attend classes once again and take their exams with the new batch of students in 2003. However, the institute had never before encountered a situation where more than five or six students had failed and they could be accommodated along with the new first year students who number 150 in total.

AICTE guidelines stipulate that the institute cannot take in more than 150 students in a class and that is why the principal Navin Nanchahal was not sure of the legality of admitting a large number of failed students. However, AICTE and the ministry of tourism, according to the principal, allowed the college to take in the additional failed students. Of those who had failed 37 have taken admission.

The principal rued that despite the controversy that was created by the failed students many of the first year students were again bunking classes and not complying with the mandatory 75 per cent attendance. â€˜â€˜We have written to the parents of the children and sent registered letters forewarning them that their wards are again not taking classes seriously,â€™â€™ said Nanchahal.

The institute has started additional classes for the first year students to avoid a repeat of this yearâ€™s result where a number of students had failed and more than half the class had got compartments. Teachers complain that despite the total strength of the first year batch being 187, hardly 40 to 50 students attend the special classes.

29,They can't threaten us with Central rule: CM,"CHANNAPATANA: Chief Minister S.M. Krishna on Wednesday ruled out the possibility of a mid-term poll in Karnataka, and said President''s rule cannot be used as a ``scarecrow to threaten us''''.

Speaking to reporters during a break of his padyatra from Ramanagaram to Channapatna, he said the Constitution and Supreme Court were clear about imposing President''s rule. ``Article 356 or central rule cannot be used as a scarecrow to scare us. In the last 55 years, there have been several debates, precedents and the S.R. Bommai judgment. I have read the ruling thrice and everybody should read it,'''' he asserted, responding to Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalitha''s demand for imposition of President''s rule in Karnataka.

Asked if the padyatra is being undertaken as a prelude to mid-term poll, Krishna said: ``Mid-term elections are only a day dream. They will be held only in August/September 2004. This is for everybody''s information to make preparations.''''

Defending the padyatra, Krishna said in a federal structure such yatras strengthen the democratic bond between the electorate and elected. ``One who is running the government gets a chance to meet people and get their reactions. People''s response to the padyatra has been good. I am confident of what I am doing.''''

Referring to former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda''s ``awareness rally'''' from October 10, Krishna said he didn''t find it surprising. ``Ours is a country of rallies and padyatras. My government stands on the record of our three-year performance and I am willing to go to the people in 2004 with the programme that I have implemented. People are judges. Ultimately, we should all bow before the people,'''' he said.

Responding to a query about defying the Supreme Court order directing Karnataka to release water, Krishna said the matter is sub-judice. ``I can''t talk about it.'''' On Tamil Nadu filing another contempt petition against Karnataka, Krishna said it is ``their privilige.''''

The CM was thankful to Prime Minister A.B. Vajpayee for being ``considerate and acting whenever the state wanted to.'''' ``His international visit was planned much earlier. I do not want to blame the PM.''''

When asked if the stand-off between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu was not affecting the federal structure of the country, Krishna shot back: ``Why don''t you mediate? See, I am willing to talk to Jayalalitha and go to Chennai also.''''

The Chief Minister exuded confidence that nature would play an important role in resolving the water crisis. ``Whenever such a situation has arisen, nature has played an important role. This time also, I don''t rule out nature''s role,'''' he added.

30,"PM, Advani to decide on disinvestment of oil PSUs: Naik","NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani would decide on the disinvestment of oil PSUs Hindustan Petroleum Corporation and Bharat Petroleum Corporation, Petroleum Minister Ram Naik said on Wednesday night.

Naik said he was not opposed to disinvestment in principle but was apprehensive about the desirability of strategic sale of the two companies.

""I have presented my argument in the Cabinet and the Prime Minister has said that a review would be done within three months,"" he told a television channel.

Seeking to play down the dip in share prices of the oil majors following the decision to defer their disinvestment by three months, the minister said share markets rise or fall on speculation and this fluctuation does not affect the ""real value"" of a company.

He said the dividend given by the two companies were still the same.

31,Vaghela criticises 10 pm deadline on garbas,"VADODARA: Shankersinh Vaghela, president of the Gujarat Pradesh Congress Committee has criticised the state government for the strict implementation of the 10 pm deadline on garbas this Navratri. Speaking to reporters here after meeting party leaders from South Gujarat on Wednesday, he said the Congress never imposed this kind of control on the people of the state.

Vaghela said, ""The second name for Gujarat is garba. You cannot stop the people from enjoying this festival. Such control is not necessary."" He added that similar deadlines had been imposed earlier as well, but people openly flouted them. ""The only reason the people are listening to the police this year is because they feel insecure after the riots and the terrorist attack at Akshardham. In fact, there is large-scale insecurity in the state,"" Vaghela said.

Suresh Pachuri, Congress central observer from New Delhi, said that they had received a number of complaints against the 10 pm deadline and will see what can be done about it.

Vaghela also used this opportunity to launch an attack on caretaker Chief Minister Narendra Modi for his utterances during the Gaurav Yatra. ""Modi says Congress has given Gujarat a bad name, but I would say that Prime Minister Vajpayee has defamed Gujarat by openly stating that the Gujarat riots were a ''kalank'',"" he said.

Speaking on the state of co-operative banks in the state, he demanded a CBI inquiry into the issue. ""It is the BJP and their functionaries who are running these banks and they are playing with the savings of the small banks. The CBI should find out under whose authority such large loans are being given out and who are the beneficiaries,"" Vaghela said.

When asked about the possibility of the creation of a third front in the state in the coming elections, Vaghela joked, ""I have already tried my hand at that and I don''t think there is a possibility now!""

According to Vaghela, the entire state administration is only focussing on one thing; the chief minister''s Gaurav Yatra. He said, ""In the process, no important decisions for the state''s welfare is being taken.""

32,Panchjanya report against govt upsets RSS,"NEW DELHI: The RSS is reportedly â€˜â€˜upsetâ€™â€™ that an editorial in one of its official mouthpieces, Panchjanya, (October 13), has attacked the government in intemperate language, giving a new twist to the latest criticism of the BJP-led coalition from within the Parivar.

On Wednesday, the RSS distanced itself from the editorial with its junior spokesperson Ram Madhav saying: â€˜â€˜The RSS does not subscribe to the views expressed in the editorial. It can, at best, be described as the views of the Panchjanya management or the writer.â€™â€™

Generally, even if the occasional article in the RSSâ€™ mouthpieces differs marginally or are more strident than the Sanghâ€™s official line, the editorials reflect the official stand. Sangh sources say: â€˜â€˜In this case, it appears that Panchjanya has entered a factional fight within the BJP and is backing the group opposed to the PM. Such language is inexcusable. It is extremely unfortunate.â€™â€™

The publication of the offending editorial comes on the heels of Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) leaders taking turns to attack the BJP-led government for its failure to tackle terrorism, even characterising the top brass as â€˜â€˜power-hungryâ€™â€™.

The Panchjanya editorial, titled, â€˜â€˜Ham intazar karenge, magar... (Weâ€™ll wait, but...)â€™â€™, says the people are tired of hearing that Pakistan is responsible for the continued assaults on Hindus and that the successful completion of elections in Jammu and Kashmir is a â€˜â€˜slap on the face ofâ€™â€™ that country. There is only one place for a government, such as the current one, which does not want to hear any criticism and that is â€˜â€˜the dustbin of historyâ€™â€™.

The editorial continues: â€˜â€˜Thanks to Ramji, it is Sonia who is in the oppositionâ€™â€™, â€˜â€˜someone who is neither capable of saying anything or doing anythingâ€™â€™. If this government had been in the opposition, it says, it would have been out on the streets, â€˜â€˜calling bandhs, sitting on dharna and saying that the government is uselessâ€™â€™.

Then for a moment, the editorial seems to soften its line and says it is true that the government has mounted a concerted attack on terrorists, and it would be unfair to characterise this government as insensitive to the plight of Hindus; it would also be incorrect to say that the Prime Minister and Deputy PM L K Advani are insensitive to the inhuman killings of Hindus.

But then the edit again shifts tack and says that this government is down on its knees before the US at a time when even many Western nations have refused to attack the American line on Iraq. Perhaps the terrorists who attacked the Akshardham temple have been killed, â€˜â€˜but the man who sent them, Pervez Musharraf, is sitting laughing in the lap of the USâ€™â€™.

The biggest issue today, the edit concludes, is how to bypass the US and break the backbone of Pakistan. â€˜â€˜It is for that moment that all patriots are waiting.â€™â€™

33,Long-term fertiliser policy finalised,"NEW DELHI: The group of ministers asked by the Union cabinet to formulate a proposal for a new urea-fertiliser pricing policy has completed the task.

The group, chaired by K C Pant, deputy chairman of the Planning Commission, included ariculture minister Ajit Singh, petroleum minister Ram Naik and fertiliser minister Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa. The recommendations will now go to the cabinet.

The annual government subsidy to this sector is close to Rs 140 billion; it is also a politically sensitive issue. In September 2000, the official Expenditure Reforms Commission (ERC) had suggested dismantling the system of controls put all over the sector and enabling it to become competitive with imports. This was to be done over five years.

The ministers were entrusted with the task of finding a politically acceptable way forward after studying the ERC suggestion.

Since 1977, in what is called the retention pricing scheme (RPS), the government buys fertiliser from each manufacturing unit at a price equal to the average production cost, plus a post-tax return of 12 per cent on net worth.

It then sells to the farmer at subsidised prices quite unrelated to the production costs. This gives the industry no incentive at all to become competitive.

The Pant panel has decided to group the urea units into six groups, based on their technology and inputs, and to base the subsidy on the grouping.

A complex formula has been decided to measure the subsidy, to take effect from April 1, 2003.

34,Disinvestment dept prepares to struggle,"NEW DELHI: The department of disinvestment (DoD) is preparing for, what a highly placed official said, a â€˜â€˜long bloody struggle in Indiaâ€™s privatisation dreamâ€™â€™.

The successes of the past year have given way to caution. So much so that DoD is willing to go by the formula of partially privatising BPCL and strategically selling HPCL. â€˜â€˜Though DoD is against the idea, we need cabinet backing for this scheme. If privatisation stops now, chances are it would not get going for a while. We donâ€™t want that,â€™â€™ said the official.

But this has not dampened the enthusiasm for disinvestment in the department. They are taking their present difficulties in their stride, citing analogies of the experience elsewhere. The official, for example, saw the present cabinet standoff on privatisation as being similar to the one in England between Margaret Thatcher and Geoffrey Howe in the 80s. After failing to become the prime minister, Howe had used the privatisation stick to attack Thatcher. She could not remove him but she maintained the momentum of privatisation and came out with flying colours.

â€˜â€˜In India,â€™â€™ said the official, â€˜â€˜Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee has to contend with three Howes. He can get rid of one, retain the other two and carry on with disinvestment.â€™â€™ The official said that of all the cabinet members, it is Vajpayee himself who appears to understand the importance of disinvestment.

Disinvestment minister Arun Shourie, the official said, has come to realise that the opposition to privatisation will grow more as the government ends its term. â€˜â€˜Infighting within the coalition is being conducted through the danda of privatisation.â€™â€™

35,"Cong hopes to form J&K govt, says Arjun","NEW DELHI: While the Congress on Wednesday expressed confidence about forming a government with the help of like-minded parties and independents in J&K, senior party leader Arjun Singh said the party would launch a campaign against the Union government over its poor track record on internal security.

At the same time, he added that despite the lack of unity in the Union cabinet over major economic policy decisions, his party would not precipitate mid-term polls in the country.

Singh said the NDA governmentâ€™s problems have nothing to do with ideology. â€˜â€˜The government is looting the country and the problem is about sharing the loot. One of the problems is also that Advani wants to occupy Vajpayeeâ€™s space. Heâ€™s entitled to do what he wants. But we are concerned because in the process, constitutional positions are getting weakened,â€™â€™ said Singh.

Terming the elections in J&K as a positive development, Singh said the government did hardly anything in the state. He said the people of the state had had enough of militancy and wanted a change. â€˜â€˜There was a bus ride, armstice, action and then a relapse to militancy. The Congress gave support to the government to fight terrorism. But it was never a blank cheque. Now it has become increasingly clear that the government is incapable of fighting terrorism.â€™â€™

Singh said there is no change in the Congressâ€™ support to the fight against terrorism. â€˜â€˜But weâ€™ll campaign to tell the masses that terrorists have a free run of this country. â€™â€™ He said he did not foresee the NDA governmentâ€™s privatisation squabbles resulting in mid-term general elections.

He maintained that the BJP-BSP tie-up in the northern states required to be countered by the Congress. This would be done not by striking alliances with other parties but by enlarging the party programme to empower Dalits and other weaker sections of society.

36,J&K elections a victory for India: Advani,"SOLAN: Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani, on Wednesday, hailed the smooth conduct of all the four rounds of assembly elections in Jammu and Kashmir and described the elections as a victory for the country.

Advani while addressing a public gathering on the occasion of the inauguration of Jaypee university of information and technology (JUIT) at Rachiana village about 30 km from here said the elections were a victory of the democratic fabric of the country against the perpetrators of terrorism. It was for the first time that public attention was focused towards the percentage of voter turnout rather than the victory of any particular party, he added.

Expressing happiness over the about 52 per cent voter turnout in the last phase of elections in Doda, he expressed the opinion that it was a commendable task keeping in view the fact that the area was severely affected with terrorism.

37,NGO gives clean chit to J&K polls,"NEW DELHI: A team of observers sent by a non-government organisation (NGO) to observe the Jammu and Kashmir assembly elections says the polls were, on the whole, free and fair.

The Rural Litigation and Entitlement Kendra (RLEK) had sent a team to the state for a month. Composed mostly of young interns doing their post-graduate courses in human rights, the team says the Election Commission deserves a substantial pat on its back.

The RLEK team has certain exceptions to its observation from all over, besides noting what people had to say on matters in this regard. Its report, which was issued to the media in New Delhi and in Dehra Dun on Wednesday, says:

> the EC did largely succeed in ensuring a free and fair poll;

> the factors responsible included using poll staff from outside the state, electronic voting machines (EVMs) and ensuring transparency in the conduct of the machinery â€” allowing diplomats, observers and groups like RLEK to move freely and to take their observations seriously â€” and having an effective complaints redressal machinery;

> the Kashmir Valley was marked by large-scale boycott of the polls in many areas, partly due to fear, but often due to disgust or cynicism with the poll process and its aftermath. This should not be overlooked, nor those who stayed away regarded as anti- national;

> accurate and complete voter registration, though a pre- poll aim, had scope for improvement, and should be repeated;

> the goodwill centres (â€˜sadbhavna kendrasâ€™) established by the Army near the Line of Control need to be imitated by other security forces in their areas as well.

Above all, notes RLEK, there is now a platform for a solution to be worked upon for the violence-stricken state by initiating a dialogue among all regions and sections of society.

Avdesh Kaushal, head of RLEK, says the people seem to have more faith in non-politicians in this regard and they could, perhaps, get involved in starting the process. The RLEK, the Dehra Dun- based NGO was earlier recognised by the Supreme Court, among others, for a prolonged and successful effort to restore the ravaged ecology of the Doon valley.
