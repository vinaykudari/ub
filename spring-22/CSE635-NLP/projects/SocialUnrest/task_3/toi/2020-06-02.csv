0,Dirty Yamuna clean-bowls govt,"NEW DELHI: Stung by criticism over the symbolic shramdaan, Delhi government officials are wondering how to lend a positive note to the Clean Yamuna saga which has all the makings of a tragedy at present.

Chief minister Sheila Dikshit has asked senior officials to chalk out a feasible plan that will show visible results in a short span of time.

The urgency of the situation stems from the ongoing four-day Clean Yamuna campaign that will culminate on World Environment Day on June 5. Though Delhi is supposed to get almost Rs 400 crore under the Yamuna Action Plan (YAP) phase-II, Delhi government officials feel that the Centre is dragging its feet over the clearances.

A senior official said: â€˜â€˜We are still in the decision-making stage due to funding and logistical constraints. But some decision will be taken in the next two days.â€™â€™ He added that Dikshit is expected to announce cer-tain aspects of a detailed project report on the slum rehabilitation plan and public awareness drive that are part of the second phase of YAP.

The loan agreement between Government of India and the Japanese Bank of International Cooperation (JBIC) was signed on March 31, 2003 for YAP-II.

But according to environment ministry officials, the legal procedures will take about three months.

â€˜â€˜The project can only be implemented by next February,â€™â€™ the official said. Selection of project management consultants and other ground work is expected to take several months. Officials, however, point out that if Delhi government plans to take any part of the project on its own they will not only have to arrange for their own funding but also not have the benefit of international advice.

â€˜â€˜There is less interference in the tendering process if an international institution is involved,â€™â€™ an official said.

Admitting the haste with which the phase-I was botched, officials say that documentation and studies are in place for phase-II.

â€˜â€˜We are better prepared for the second stage,â€™â€™ an official added.

2,Villagers stop agriculture minister's cavalcade,"PUNE: Minister of state for agriculture Dada Jadhavrao became a victim of public ire on Monday when his cavalcade was caught in a rasta roko on Saswad road.

Irate villagers of Urali Devachi,who were protesting against the presence of a Pune municipal corporation (PMC) garbage depot in the area, stopped the ministerâ€™s entourage as he was proceeding to Mastani Talao.

The protestors finally gave passage to Jadhavrao, but not without getting a promise that he would return with public works department (PWD) minister Vijaysingh Mohite-Patil, who is the districtâ€™s guardian minister.

Jadhavrao did live up to the promise and came back with Mohite-Patil, who invited the villagers for a meeting at the circuit house in Pune. The meeting was chaired by Mohite-Patil and attended by Vitthal Tupe, PMC commissioner Sanjay Kumar, district collector Madhukar Kokate, PMC standing committee chairman Dilip Tupe, PMC additional commissioner D.S. Zagade, Haveli panchayat samiti chairman Ashok More and members of the â€˜Kachra depot sangharsh samitiâ€™.

Speaking to TNN, ex-sarpanch of Urali Devachi village, Kisan Maruti Bhadade, said that the â€˜kachra depotâ€™ was causing many problems in the area like air pollution, because of the dumping of many materials, including animal carcasses, groundwater pollution and diseases like malaria, dengue and gastro-enteritis. Briefing reporters after the meeting, Patil said that tap water would be provided to the village in 6-7 months.

He added that as the villagers had complained that the tanker water supplied by the PMC was inadequate, the number of tankers will be increased. â€œAlso, a number of small tanks will be built to store water,â€� he added. Mohite- Patil said that, at present, the PMC was using covers on at least 70 per cent of the vehicles used to transport garbage to the village to reduce the stench and the rest would be covered soon.

The PMC would initiate spraying and dusting activities in the village, he added. He said that a committee, consisting of the district collector, PMC commissioner, pollution control board officials and engineers will be set up to decide on the shifting of the depot to an alternative site.

The zoning and decentralisation proposals for the depot will also be considered by the committee, wherein the city would be divided into different zones and garbage would be disposed of at different depots. A decision to build a hospital at the Urali Devachi was also taken. The hospital would be built by the PMC and maintained by the Zilla Parishad.

3,Police rule out sabotage theory in Amritsar train incident,"AMRITSAR: What led to the fire that gutted a brand new stationery coach parked at the safety line at the Amritsar railway station on Sunday is yet to be established. But the conflicting statements and the pass-the-buck game has already begun between the railway authorities and the Government Railway Police (GRP).

Police discards the sabotage theory, as pointed out by a few railway officials, on the basis of circumstantial evidences. On the other hand, railway authorities are not ready to accept the police version. They say the cause has to be intentional as such an incident could not occur just be chance.

Ajit Singh Virk, SHO, GRP, who is investigating into the incident, informed the TNN on Monday that investigations revealed that some railway employees spent their leisure time in the parked coaches. It is believed that a carelessly thrown cigarette stub may have caused the fire.

Moreover, he said, the coach that caught fire was parked close to the RPF. He added there were 41 other coaches parked in the yard and it was unlikely that anyone could have taken the risk of doing a mischief near the post.

Thirty-two out of these 41 coaches were unlocked. He said there was no reason why anyone would first break the lock or the window of a coach to cause a fire, when other coaches were easily accessible.

Station master Daulat Ram, who is currently on leave, defended the railway staff, saying a fire caused by a burning cigarette stub could not have spread in such a short span of time.

Within 30 minutes, the coach was burnt to ashes, he added.

Asked why the miscreants took the risk of burning a coach that was parked close to security post, he said an offender could strike anywhere.

Assistant Traffic Manger M S Bhullar refused to comment, saying investigations into the case were on.

4,"Rlys, Bihar govt wrangle over accident cause","PATNA: The wrangle between the railways and the state government over the cause of the Magadh Express accident continues. The state government has once again refused to accept the theory of sabotage.

Commissioner for railway safety Mahesh Chand went to the site on Monday to make an on-the-spot inquiry into what could have been another major train accident. While he was shown the rail track, reportedly cut with a saw, the concerned railway officials also gave him the saw, allegedly used to cut the railway track.

â€˜â€˜The driver of the train said he did not see anyone after he applied the emergency brake,â€™â€™ said railway IG V Narayanan. He added that preliminary investigations into the accident were still on and forensic experts may be called in for help. â€˜â€˜However, on the basis of what evidence is available, it does not appear to be a case of sabotage,â€™â€™ he said.

According to him, it was most unlikely that 4.33 metres of the track could be cut with a saw within a span of 15 minutes. â€˜â€˜Rajdhani and Upper India Express trains had crossed the same spot half an hour before the accident,â€™â€™ Narayanan said, adding there was no extensive damage done at the place, where the track was removed.

â€˜â€˜On the other hand, below the eighth and ninth bogies, extensive damage has been done to the tracks. In fact, around 200 metres of track has been damaged. It is possible that the damage could have been caused by poor maintenance of the tracks,â€™â€™ Narayanan said.

According to him, whenever extremists indulged in cases of subversion, they have tried to extract maximum publicity from it. â€˜â€˜They always leave pamphlets or shout slogans in favour of extremist outfits to justify their action. But, in this case, no such evidence was found,â€™â€™ he said, adding that the extremistsâ€™ outfits in the past had targeted railway property and buildings, not people.

Incidentally, low casualty and injury in the Magadh Express accident were due to slow speed of the train. The driver did not get clearance to speed up since Rajdhani Express had passed along the same route barely 15 minutes ago.

6,"Goud, Naidu framed party leader: Cong","HYDERABAD: The Congress sees a slander campaign in the arrest of party leader Vaddepalli Narsinga Rao. Rao is an AICC member and was nabbed on Sunday on charges of landgrabbing.

On Monday, the arrest of the party leader drew loud protests from the PCC, which dubbed the move â€œpolitically motivatedâ€� and a doing of CM N Chandrababu Naidu and home minister T Devender Goud. â€œRao has been arrested on trumped up charges,â€� PCC president M Satyanarayana Rao claimed. The police, he claimed, acted at the behest of Naidu and Goud to sully the Congress image.

The PCC chief claimed the police had no documentary evidence to prove their charges against Narsinga Rao. â€œThe Congress too has evidence to nail TDP leaders in landgrabbing cases. We will bring them all out when itâ€™s time,â€� Rao said.

Launching a tirade against Cyberabad police chief M Mahender Reddy, he accused him of dancing to the tunes of Goud and CM. â€œI was under the impression that Reddy is a sincere officer. The false case on the AICC member has shown him in his true colours.â€�

7,Development fund hassles irk Bihar legislators,"PATNA: The legislators of Bihar are a frustrated lot. Over Rs 220 crore meant for their development funds is blocked in the public ledger (PL) account, and the accountant general (AG) of the state has refused to give the nod for spending this money.

More than half of the amount earmarked for development schemes recommended by legislators during the last financial year remained unspent. They are given Rs 1 crore each a year for development work in their respective constituencies. Schemes recommended by them are executed by government agencies.

The legislators are angry with officials. ""I have been able to spend only Rs 25 lakh of my quota. I gave the list of schemes to the district officials on time. But due to the prevailing red-tapism and the officials raising so many objections and queries the fund could not be spent during the last financial year,"" observed RJD MLA Tarkeshwar Singh. He said in Saran district only one MLA, Udit Rai, was able to spend his entire quota of fund for development work.

""It has put us in an embarrassing situation before the people. I recommended for construction of a school building in Maner that had been washed away. Even after three years, the Rs 11-lakh scheme is yet to be completed,"" remarked RJD MLC Nagendra Prasad Singh. ""What can one do? There is corruption here right from the peon level. Schemes recommended by me are delayed by officials on one pretext or another,"" said MLA Bishwanath Singh.

""The delay is due to the negligence and corruption of bureaucracy. Even after the Panchayati Raj elections, BDOs maintain their dominance in clearing the projects recommended even by legislators,"" said Masaurhi MLA Dharmendra Kumar. He said many projects he had recommended remained incomplete. ""A sewerage scheme I had recommended is only half complete. The result is that water and garbage get accumulated at places where the villagers live,"" he added.

JD(U) leader Bijendra Prasad Yadav said the legislators are unable to spend their development funds due to procedural problems. ""During the last fiscal, a separate account was opened for the legislators'' development fund as a result of which the unspent amount had to be deposited in the PL account. Only 50 per cent of the amount is released in the first instalment. There is a delay in the release of the remaining amount,"" he said. ""The funds are released in December. Two-thirds of the schemes recommended by us are sanctioned in the last four months,"" said BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi.

Speaker Sadanand Singh held a meeting with ministers and officials to discuss how to deal with the ""hassles"" given by the AG. The legislators feel that the government will have to introduce budgetary provisions so that the previous year''s funds can be utilised by the legislators in the following year.

8,'84 riot victims slam Cong,"AMRITSAR: Emotions ran high in the precincts of the Akal Takht where hundreds of victims of the 1984 anti-Sikh riots had gathered from different parts of Punjab on Monday.

The riot victims started crying and raising slogans at the Akal Takht when the five Sikh women, who are part of the â€˜â€˜Shaheedi Jathaâ€™â€™ of â€˜â€˜Danga Peerit Welfare Societyâ€™â€™, Punjab, wore the â€˜â€˜Shaheedi Banaâ€™ (martyrsâ€™ dress) and slung placards reading â€” â€˜Sikh Shaheedi Jatha, 1984â€™â€™ â€” around their necks.

The anti-Congress feeling was prominent at the gathering. The victims alleged that the party and its leaders were involved in the anti-Sikh riots of 1984. Some of the leaders of the society made venomous speeches against the Congress including AICC president Sonia Gandhi, H K L Bhagat and others.

Gurdeep Kaur, a riot victim who is also part of the â€˜â€˜jathaâ€™â€™, told Times News Network that the attack on Sikhs had been masterminded by the then Congress leaders. She said that now the Congress government in the state had turned a blind eye towards the plight of people who had migrated to Punjab from Delhi.

Asked if the decision to end their lives was justified, Gurdeep replied that there was no other option before them. She said, â€˜â€˜How else will we coerce the government into accepting our demands? We have been mute spectators to the suffering of our families, it is high time that the government listens to us,â€™â€™ she said.

Madhvi, another riot victim, fainted after seeing Gurdeep and the other women dressed in black gowns. â€˜â€˜How long are we going to suffer for something, for which, others are responsible? Even the government has adopted an indifferent attitude towards our demands,â€™â€™ she said.

Santosh Kaur, who claims that she lost her husband during the anti-Sikh riots, said that they would have never taken such a step had the government given them assistance to restart their lives.

â€˜â€˜We feel cheated, politicians have played with our emotions. What other option do we have before us?â€™â€™ she asked.

Baldev Kaur, another riot victim, claimed that her 20-yearold son had died in the riots. â€˜â€˜How long will the government see us suffer? We have to ensure that our children have a secure future,â€™â€™ she said.

Riot victim Kirpal Kaur, who had volunteered to join the â€˜Shaheedi Jathaâ€™, withdrew her name minutes before wearing the black robe. She was replaced with Mata Harbans Kaur.

9,HC seeks govt reply on Remo case,"AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat High Court has issued notices to the state government following an application moved by Remo group MD, Zaheer Jalaluddin Rana, which sought quashing of the FIR against him.

Vacation judge Justice AH Mehta on Monday issued notices to the state government and officials of CID Crime, directing them to file their reply by June 16.

The judge also directed the respondents to file replies on an interim relief sought by Rana along with the plea for quashing of the FIR.

10,J&K govt presents zero-deficit budget,"SRINAGAR: Even though Jammu and Kashmir recorded a fiscal deficit of Rs 955 crore during the current year, the Mufti government presented a zero-deficit budget in state legislative assembly on Tuesday.

Announcing the measures for fiscal reforms in the state, Jammu and Kashmir finance and planning minister Muzzfar Hussian Beig informed the House that petrol, liquor, chicken and mutton will be costlier in the state.

He said the Union finance ministry had agreed in principle to give the state a higher share in the debt swap scheme which would enable the state repay a substantial part of the debt towards the Centre.

He said the state will move to the value added tax (VAT) system from October 1, 2003.

Pronouncing new proposal in the House, the minister said the import duty will be increased by Rs 5 per LPL, while license fee will be marginally increased for bars attached with hotels, restaurants, distilleries, brewery and bottling plants.

A levy of toll on ad-unitum basis on chicks/chicken imported to the state at Rs 2 per bird would be imposed while Rs 10 to Rs 25 per cattle would be charged during the import of the animal, Bieg said.

For development of roads, the government has proposed a levy of cess on motor spirit at the rate of Re 1 per litre sold in Jammu and Kashmir.

This is for the first that the state has decided its own plan size instead of the Planning Commission fixing it, the minister said.

He said that the plan size worked out for the state was Rs 2,500 crore with capital component of Rs 1,627 crore and revenue component of Rs 873 crore.

Rs 100 crore would be provided in the plan for meeting the state''s share in centrally sponsored schemes. This will enable the state to get Rs 500 to Rs 600 crore from centrally sponsored schemes over and above the Rs 2500 plan.

Stressing on the state''s own revenue, Beig said that there would be increase by 15 per cent on the tax revenue in Jammu and Kashmir.

11,Jaitley's charges are flawed: Digvijay,"NEW DELHI: As long as the election campaign in Madhya Pradesh centred round the ban on cow slaughter and the cake controversy, chief minister Digvijay Singh appeared to be sailing along smoothly.

But the BJP''s statistics-based assault on the state of MP''s development - led by Union law minister Arun Jaitley - appears to have knocked some wind out of his sails.

So much so that the battle for MP moved to Delhi on Tuesday, with Digvijay launching a frontal attack against Jaitley for quoting ``out of context'''' the state''s development statistics, adding he would issue a detailed reply on Wednesday.

The MP CM said he wondered why Jaitley, during his tenure as BJP general secretary in charge of Gujarat, had chosen to speak of Hindutva rather than development, but expressed his happiness at the minister''s decision to talk about development in MP now.

Punching holes in Jaitley''s chargesheet, he said the CII report from which the law minister had liberally quoted had not been officially released. Digvijay added that the figures being quoted by Jaitley were for 1991, at a time when his party was not in power.

Questioning the variables chosen to measure development, he pointed out that in the period 1994-2003, barring the last year which was marked by drought, MP had the distinction of joining the league of faster growing states, registering a six per cent growth rate. The state''s reforms had won it national and international awards.

Digvijay said that barring power generation, his government had fulfilled over 90 per cent of its pre-poll promises. With the help of detailed data, he highlighted his government''s achievements in education, health, employment generation (mainly in rural areas), infrastructure development, improvement in the PDS system, welfare measures for the SCs/STs/OBCs, minorities and other weaker sections.

He was answering the charges that had been made by Jaitley when he had visited MP recently. The latter had said there had been no change in the backwardness in MP over the years and the Congress, which had ruled the state for nearly half a century, should be held responsible. To back his line, he had quoted extensively from reports prepared, among others, by the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation and Indicus Analytics for CII and the Planning Commission''s National Human Development Report-2001.

Digvijay''s defence of his governance record did not go unnoticed on Tuesday with the BJP gloating that the MP CM had trapped himself in a debate over development in the state.

Admitting that power had been a major concern for MP ever since Chhatisgarh had been carved out of it more than two years ago, the MP CM said the state government has signed an Lou for power sector reforms with the Centre. Neighbouring states such as Delhi and Himachal Pradesh have also agreed to provide surplus power to MP.

He said that power generation in the private sector had not yielded the desired results anywhere in the country, including MP, and added that the state sector would be able to generate 3,673 MW additional power by the end of 2008.

In the field of infrastructure, he said MP''s 51,000 villages had problems with roads that were being addressed on a war footing: Rs 1,354 crore worth of rural roads projects were underway while Rs 521 crore worth work covering 2,901 villages had been completed.

Simultaneously, a special economic zone in Indore, the first greenfield SEZ in India, will become operational soon. Additionally, 16 MOUs with prospective investors have been signed, he said.

12,Karunakaran faction attacks Antony govt,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The fragile truce in faction-ridden Congress in Kerala appears to have collapsed on Tuesday following a meeting of Karunakaran supporters. The Karunakaran faction has launched a sharp attack on the functioning of the A K Antony government.

According to â€œIâ€� group sources, a feeling was strong in the camp that the government had failed to live up to expectations and if things continued like this the party in the state would have to suffer.

The meeting was held in the backdrop of the senior leader''s last week''s outburst at Antony at a pro-Congress staff organisation function charging the latter with shirking responsibility of issues including Marad carnage.

The faction had of late expressed strong resentment at the continuance of tourism minister K V Thomas who had recently deserted their camp in the wake of the Rajya Sabha crisis. The group is also sore that M P Gangadharan, another deserter from their camp, was still occupying the post of deputy leader of the Congress legislature party.

According to sources, the meeting discussed the strategy to be adopted at the KPCC executive meeting to be held on June 9 to be attended by AICC general secretary in charge of Kerala affairs Ahamed Patel.
