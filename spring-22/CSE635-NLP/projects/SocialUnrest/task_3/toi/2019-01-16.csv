2,Zhu visit signals changes in China policy,"new delhi: premier zhu rongji's state visit to india was full of symbolism in which the chinese take special delight. in 1965, as the indian and pakistan armies were being mobilised, marshal chen ye paid a significant visit to pakistan on september 1, 1965. in 1971, as the indian and pakistan armies confronted each other eyeball to eyeball, zulfikar ali bhutto was dispatched by general yahya khan to beijing to request that china should apply military pressure on india. now as the two armies are once again on battle deployment, chinese premier zhu rongji carries out his scheduled visit to india, endorses india's stand on terrorism and agrees to setting up of a joint working group on the issue. that should send out a clean message to islamabad. china now finds that all its investments in pakistan in nuclear and missile fields and in conventional arms are not likely to pay any worthwhile dividends. pakistan, because of its sponsorship of terrorism as an instrument of foreign policy, has brought the us into afghanistan, central asia and pakistan with a massive military presence and that is not likely to be withdrawn in the near future. the us is likely to stay in pakistan to supervise pakistan's transition to a moderate islamic state which is likely to be a long-term process. the large us economic and military involvement in pakistan is likely to place significant curbs on the ongoing nuclear, missile and conventional arms relationships between beijing and islamabad. it is also likely that the us may no longer have much compunction about publicising the past and present chinese proliferation activities. china has always been sensitive to the issue of self-determination. the chinese know very well that the cases for tibet and xinjiang exercising self-determination are much stronger than in the case of kashmir. except during the maoist period when the chinese foreign policy was reckless, china has maintained a consistent attitude on kashmir just as india has on tibet — that it should be settled between india and pakistan. during his address to the pakistani senate, president jiang zemin of china advised the pakistanis if an issue could not be settled by this generation, it should be left to a future generation to be tackled — an advice pakistan is unwilling to accept. the ongoing war against terrorism is altering radically the strategic landscape of south, south-west and central asia. dealing with the aftermath of this war is going to take quite some time and the us military presence in west and south-west asia and in the indian ocean is likely to increase. indo-us relations are likely to improve. the us was already given notice of its withdrawal from the anti- ballistic missile treaty. that has not evoked a violent protest from russia nor is it likely to lead to an arms race. in these circumstances, china has to carry out a major revision of its foreign policy towards the subcontinent. the visit of premier zhu rongji to delhi is likely to be a harbinger of such a revision.

3,One more Punjab minister quits,"chandigarh: even as nominations for the coming punjab assembly elections begin on wednesday, the ruling akali dal faces a swelling crowd of rebels, including three ministers. while two of them quit last week, the third resigned on tuesday. in over 25 constituencies, ruling party leaders who have been denied the ticket have raised the banner of revolt threatening the party set-up in the run-up to the polls. in a concerted exercise, chief minister prakash singh badal, who is also president of the akali dal, has sought to rebuild bridges with many of them. he has entrusted the task of winning them over to two senior party colleagues, balwinder singh bhunder and kewal singh badal. however, senior leaders say they are not perturbed with the phenomenon which always happens whenever the seats are allotted. a similar situation, they say, had also arisen on the eve of the 1997 elections but was solved in due course. bhunder is confident that this time too, things will smoothen out soon. he says with new faces being fielded on nearly 30 seats, such resentment was expected. but what is worrying the leaders is that the rebellion on such a large scale might, by default, lend a psychological advantage to the rival panthic morcha. close on the heels of two ministers quitting the badal ministry, the problem for the party aggravated on tuesday with mohinder kaur josh, minister of state for health and family welfare, announcing her decision to quit the ministry after being denied the party ticket. she also announced her decision to contest as an independent from the sham chaurasi constituency. prior to that, two ministers, ranjit singh ballian and gobind singh kanjla, had announced their resignation from the party after being denied the party ticket from the sangrur and sherpur constituencies, respectively. a day later, punjab tourism development corporation chairman tarsem singh rattian also joined them as he quit his post and announced his decison to contest as an independent from the bagha purana constituency.

5,Bihar govt to cancel red cards,"patna: the bihar government is likely to cancel around 61 lakh red cards issued ostensibly to families living below the poverty line following reports of large-scale irregularities by giving the cards to undeserving people and even in fictitious names. ""i have already ordered for cancellation of all the red cards issued in bihar,"" stated food and civil supplies minister puranmasi ram on tuesday. he said a new survey will be conducted and then fresh red cards will be issued to deserving families. the red card enables a family living below the poverty line to procure essential items like food-grains and kerosene at subsidised rates. the minister said a fresh survey to identify deserving families will be conducted by the department in april. he is aware that the matter of fake red cards as well as that of wrong persons getting the red cards is being investigated by the state vigilance bureau and a large number of irregularities having been detected. ""in a large number of cases, the red cards issued by bdos were either fake or given to well-off families,"" he maintained while insisting that his department will prepare a fresh list ""honestly"". the issue of fake red cards had rocked the state assembly in the late 1990s as mla dilip verma produced on the floor of the house a large number of red cards saying that large-scale bungling was going on in the state in the name of distribution of food-grains to the poor. he alleged that while the materials were being lifted by the concerned authorities, these rarely reached the targeted population. opposition leaders maintained that the food-grains and kerosene meant for the families living below the poverty line were either being sold in the black market or smuggled to nepal. under pressure from the opposition, the government promised to make a thorough probe into the allegations. the matter was later referred to the vigilance bureau. on tuesday, ram was highly critical of leader of the opposition in the assembly sushil kumar modi, who had alleged that the minister was patronising criminal gangs in bagaha in west champaran district. charging modi with losing his mental balance, the minister challenged him to prove his allegations. he said he will file a case against modi in the court for levelling false allegations.

6,Absence of govt lawyers irks HC,"patna: a division bench of the patna high court comprising chief justice ravi s dhavan and justice shashank kumar singh expressed its displeasure over the absence of state government lawyers when the case relating to municipal elections in bihar came up for hearing on tuesday. justice dhavan, while decrying the non-availability of state government lawyers, including the advocate general, additional advocate generals and standing counsel, to defend its case, ordered for delisting of the case. however on the request of the counsel for the petitioner, mp gupta, the judges posted the case for hearing on wednesday. the chief justice earlier observed that the government has already lost a lot of money and stands to lose sizable central assistance this year too if the municipal elections are not held before the end of the current financial year. municipal polls have not been held in bihar for the last 23 years. justice dhavan observed that the constitution mandates that municipal polls be held within six months of the dissolution or demise of such bodies. in the light of the judges' earlier observation that the poor state stands to lose sizable central assistance, the state election commission (sec), which had expressed its inability to hold the municipal elections before april next, wrote a letter on tuesday to gupta, agreeing to hold the polls in february on the condition that the state government cooperates. gupta produced the letter in the court. when the chief justice looked for the state government's reply, its lawyers were found missing, which led to his displeasure. state government lawyers, including advocate general shashi anugrah narayan, were, however, seen at that time accompanying chief secretary mukund prasad in the corridors of the patna high court. the judges observed that the case would now be listed only on the request of government or sec or petitioner's counsel. it was only the passionate appeal of gupta which saved the situation.

9,Identity card mandatory for voting in civic polls,"mumbai: in an effort to curb bogus voting in the upcoming civic polls, the state election commission (sec) has made it mandatory for citizens to carry identity cards while casting their vote. so come february 10, citizens will have to flash their electoral identity cards (issued by the election commission) at the polling booth before they can cast their vote. ``however, since only 87 per cent of the population in maharashtra has been issued electoral identity cards, citizens can carry their passport, driving licence, ration card, railway i-card (issued prior to september 1, 2001) and other such documents (see box) to prove their identity,'' sec secretary b.g. veer said. stating that the commission does not have exact figures on the incidence of bogus voting, mr veer said, ``it is a known fact that impersonation is quite rampant in our elections''. in the past genuine voters have been unable to stamp the ballot paper as on reaching the polling booths they discover that somebody else has already cast their vote. ``making it compulsory for voters to carry some form of identification will definitely help check the menace to some extent,'' mr veer said. haryana and goa are the other two states which have made it compulsory for voters to carry i-cards at the time of polling. the sec has also appealed to citizens that in case a voter finds that his vote has been cast by an impersonator, he/she must insist on casting a tender vote. the presiding officer at the polling booth is bound to accept a tender vote, which will be sealed and kept aside. though the tender vote will not be counted in the normal course it can play a crucial rule in the case of a tie between the candidates. also, if the number of tender votes exceeds two per cent of the total votes cast in a booth, the sec can order a repoll for the particular booth, mr veer stated. the sec's plans to introduce electronic voting machines (evms) for the coming civic elections have been shelved for now. ``the election commission has about 10,000 evms, which were given to kerala for their local election. they have been held up in kerala due to a court case,'' mr veer maintained. according to election officers, the evms can help reduce the cost of conducting elections to a great extent. for instance, if evms are used the bmc would no longer need to spend rs 1 crore for printing ballot papers. it would help reduce the manpower requirement and also make the entire exercise of counting of votes faster and more efficient.

10,"TDP, BJP to go it alone in elections","hyderabad: the sharing of seats between the telugu desam and the bharatiya janata party in rajahmundry seems to have suffered a major set back as neither party is willing to withdraw from eight seats in the ensuing polls to the municipal corporation. though the tdp and bjp had constituted a coordination committee to sort out the differences and convince the cadre to follow instructions, there has not been any serious effort by the state leadership of the tdp and the bjp. and each holds the other responsible for the deadlock. it may be recalled that the bjp had won two lok sabha seats in the east godavari district in the last lok sabha elections and consequently the party wanted a fair distribution of seats based on its growing strength. however, following talks by senior party leaders and intervention by chief minister n chandrababu naidu, the bjp agreed to accept eight seats. the central leadership of both the parties were even hopeful that they would be able to have a joint campaign as in hyderabad. but when it came to selection the areas, the bjp said that injustice was being done to them. according to senior bjp leaders here, the telugu desam had allotted them eight seats where it (bjp) virtually had no presence. the tdp had adopted an adamant stand and was unwilling to be accommodative. it was take it or leave it attitude, one of the leaders said.this had upset the rank and file and the bjp candidates filed nominations even in seats where they should have supported the tdp. as the stalemate continued beyond the date of withdrawal, the tdp and the bjp constituted a coordination committee to sort out the problems. but the bjp leaders said that the tdp does not appear to be serious in resolving the matter. according to the leaders, said the tdp appears to have made up its mind not to have any understanding in rajahmundry. however, for strategic reasons it had refrained from making a formal announcement of the failure of talks.

19,Assamese pine for development,"arjuntol (kamrup dist): it's bihu time in rural assam. naturally enough, in this central assam village not far from guwahati, harvesting is just over and it's time once again for festivities. as the the people light the bhelaghar, the temporary straw shed set ablaze after community feasts, a night stay and other merry-making, all part of the bhogali bihu celebrations, the feeling is mixed. the prevalent mood is of acceptance of whatever fate has in store for them. ask the villagers, who have all gathered in the paddy field, whether this bihu will usher in peace and development in the state, and the reactions are varied. ""no, i don't think so,"" says sarad bezbaruah, a railway employee. the pessimism is not unnatural, especially in a village having no electricity — notwithstanding numerous promises by different politicians — and despite being a couple of km from the state capital. no wonder that not very long back, this also used to be a hub of united liberation front of asom (ulfa) activities. says a villager, who did not wish to be identified: ""the militants used our village for shelter. i personally had to host, at gunpoint, four such rebels on a particular night."" village teenagers still recall how as kids, they had sat on the laps of several top ulfa leaders and heard stories of their training days in myanmar. drunkards and eve-teasers were punished openly and made to kneel down in the main thoroughfare of arjuntol. but the goodwill the outfit earned all changed one day. ""it was around this time — close to bihu — a few years ago. four militants forced open a villager's door to take shelter. there was no need for barging into the house. had they requested him, he would have complied. the change in behaviour was marked, we started resenting them. it was obvious that the swargya raj (golden rule) they promised us was a big facade,"" recalled an elderly woman. today, the village is free from both ulfa leaders and their activities. but development still eludes arjuntol, perhaps one reason why some people are very sceptical here. however, there are many others who are still hopeful. and the best part is the strong yearning for peace. commented deepak talukdar, who teaches english in a local college: ""peace is definitely very essential. in fact, thankfully, it has already returned to a large extent in assam. all that we need now is the socio-economic development of our villagers. peace can be lasting only then."" agreed rita bez, a teacher in the nearby khainipara girls high school: ""peace and development go hand in hand. subsequent politicians have taken us for a ride. this time, we have elected a young congress leader who has become a legislator for the first time. he has promised that things will improve. let's see what he can do.""

21,Minister quits Badal govt,"chandigarh: even as nominations for the coming punjab assembly elections begin on wednesday, the ruling akali dal faces a swelling crowd of rebels, including three ministers. while two of them quit last week, the third resigned on tuesday. in over 25 constituencies, ruling party leaders who have been denied the ticket have raised the banner of revolt threatening the party set-up in the run-up to the elections. in a concerted exercise, chief minister prakash singh badal, who is also president of the akali dal, has sought to rebuild bridges with many of them. he has entrusted the task of winning them over to two senior party colleagues, balwinder singh bhunder and kewal singh badal. however, senior leaders say they are not perturbed with the phenomenon which always happens whenever the seats are allotted. a similar situation, they say, had also arisen on the eve of the 1997 elections but was solved in due course. bhunder is confident that this time too, things will smoothen out soon. he says with new faces being fielded on nearly 30 seats, such resentment was expected. but what is worrying the leaders is that the rebellion on such a large scale might, by default, lend a psychological advantage to the rival panthic morcha. close on the heels of two ministers quitting the badal ministry, the problem for the party aggravated on tuesday with mohinder kaur josh, minister of state for health and family welfare, announcing her decision to quit the ministry after being denied the party ticket. she also announced her decision to contest as an independent from the sham chaurasi constituency.
