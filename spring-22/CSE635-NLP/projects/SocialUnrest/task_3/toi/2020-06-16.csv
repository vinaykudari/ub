0,J&K Youth Cong to demonstrate against NDA govt,"SRINAGAR: Launching a scathing attack on NDA government at the centre for its failure on all fronts, the Jammu East MLA and state president of Youth Congress, Yogesh Sawhney said that immediately after the completion of ongoing assembly session in summer capital, massive demonstrations at district level in the state will be held by Youth Congress.

These demonstrations will be to convey resentment of the people and to unmask the true face of the NDA government.

He blamed the NDA government for not properly handling the Kashmir issue, which has gained undue international attention due to the wrong policies of the union government.

He added that Kashmir, which was an integral part of India has become a tool in the hands of NDA ministers to emotionally blackmail the innocent people of the state who have been weathering militancy for over 15 years now.

He said that instead of procrastinating on the vexed Kashmir issue, the NDA government should have formed a clear policy to solve the imbroglio, adding he said visits by the Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee and centre''s interlocutor on J&K, NN Vohra could not solve the issue unless and until some comprehensive plan to deal with the situation was implemented.

2,Most riot victims give police clean chit,"VADODARA: The two-member inquiry commission of Justice G T Nanavati and Justice K G Shah held their first hearing at Vadodara since the riots on Monday amidst protests organised by Peoplesâ€™ Union of Civil Liberties, Vadodara Shanti Abhiyan and Central Muslim Relief Committee over recent reported remarks of Justice Nanavati stating that the commission had not come across any evidence so far which showed the state governmentâ€™s complicity in the riots.

Some of these organisations were told by the commission, which is probing into the Gujarat riots and its aftermath, that their affidavits had not been received.

â€œWe had filed an affidavit on June 29 last year. However we were told that the affidavit did not exist. So we boycotted the hearing,â€� said Rohit Prajapati of PUCL.

Prof J S Bandukwala, who held aloft a placard which said â€˜Go back, Nanavatiâ€™, said â€œWe do not want to be part such an ill-led enquiry commission. Justice Nanavati has made comments that completely undermines the commissionâ€™s credibility.â€�

Interestingly, of the 34 witnesses examined, only Ghulam Farid of Panwad village told the commission on Monday that the police machinery failed during the riots. The rest of the witnesses, many of them from the Muslim community, stated that the role of the police was exemplary during the riots.

Another witness Mohammed Hussein of Por village deposed before the commission that the government had not compensated him properly. â€œMy garage incurred a loss of about Rs 3,20,000 during the riots. The government officials approached me with a compensation of Rs 10,000 which I turned down. I asked the officials for a loan which has not been sanctioned till date.â€� Interestingly, when Hussein approached the concerned authorities, they informed him that there was no such file and if it existed it was missing.

The two-member commission has asked the District Development Officer to look into the issue and submit a report within three weeks. Interestingly, a Hindu-Muslim duo of Bharatsinh Jaswantsinh and Ismail-Haji from Dhaniavi village deposed that there were no major incidents in their village as the police officials were very efficient.

They told the commission, â€œStrict orders were issued by the police and the officials were patrolling the village regularly.Other than that, they also called meetings between the two communities to maintain peace in the village.

Arvind Pandya, special counsel and co-ordinator of the Government of Gujarat for the commission said this was only the second such instance wherein a Hindu-Muslim duo has deposed before the commission.

Witnesses from Asoj, Savli Road, Dabhoi, Kauwat, Wagach, Pavijetpur, Kashipura, Por, Andhratia, Rustompura, Bhadarwa, Manjusar and other villages examined stated that the role of police in their locality during the riots was exemplary.

3,Digvijay govt misleading people: PM,"MANDLA: Side-stepping all Hindutva issues, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee on Tuesday virtually launched BJP''s campaign for the coming assembly polls charging the Digvijay Singh government in Madhya Pradesh with misleading the people.

Addressing a mammoth gathering in a predominantly tribal district adjoining Chattisgarh, Vajpayee said ""we have given a no objection certificate to Madhya Pradesh government for turning forest villages into revenue villages. But the notification has to be issued by the state government. Kerala has done it but the Madhya Pradesh Government is not putting forth the truth.""

Telling Chief Minister Digvijay Singh that ""sending me (a) love letter won''t suffice"", Vajpayee said ""as the largest democracy we have to observe some restraints and conduct in elections too.""

On the issue of giving land titles to tribals in the state, he asserted that the Centre was not responsible for it and ""people were being misled"" by the Congress Government.

Vajpayee, who declared that BJP''s stormy petrel Uma Bharti would lead the party in the coming polls, also announced that Mandla would be brought on the country''s rail map and he would ask the railway minister to carry out a project survey.

Asserting that the Centre did not discriminate against opposition ruled governments in the matter of drought relief, Vajpayee said ""we treat all states equally. Proper distribution of allotted foodgrains is the responsibility of the state government. We have given maximum relief to Rajasthan.""

""We have always worked together with different state governments but if they make a mistake we tell them,"" he said and asked the state governments to properly utilise ""the hard earned money of the public.""

Declaring that there was no place for defection in a democracy, Vajpayee said rising violence was a challenge to democracy and emphasised on building a consensus on crucial national issues.

Vajpayee also took to task Dalit leaders who defamed India abroad. ""There should not be politics in the name of Dalits. Which country does not have problems and shortcomings,"" he asked. Challenging anyone to prove that the Centre has not implemented its promise of giving one crore jobs every year, he said the number of people below the poverty line has gone down and the government wanted to establish a network of small scale and cottage industries to provide employment to the youth.

Asking the states to exploit non-conventional sources of energy to meet increasing power requirements, he also urged farmers to expand their horizons to include horticulture, floriculture and cultivation of herbs to cater to the worldwide demand.

Pointing out that his Government has belied the doomsday prophets, who predicted a short tenure for it, Vajpayee said the country was undergoing massive transformations.

Besides Uma Bharti, State BJP President Kailash Joshi, Union Ministers Sumitra Mahajan, Satyanarayan Jatiya and Faggan Singh Kulaste and BJP General Secretary Shivraj Singh Choha were present.

Interestingly, the Prime Minister did not refer to any of the contentious issues including Ayodhya and Kashmir.

4,BJP relieved by sacking of tainted UP minister Tripathi,"NEW DELHI: The BJP heaved a sigh of relief following Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Mayawati''s decision on Saturday to remove Amarmani Tripathi, the controversial minister in her Cabinet, whose name was linked with the murder of young poetess Madhumita Shukla.

Welcoming the decision, BJP spokesperson Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said, ""the step taken by the UP Chief Minister is in the right direction. The inquiry ordered by the state government is a step in the right direction and leaves no moral right for the Opposition parties to make further hue and cry over the Madhumita case.""

Ever since this scandal hit the headlines, the BJP had been worried about its possible adverse impact on the BJP-BSP coalition government in UP. Both BJP president Venkaiah Naidu and party spokesperson Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi had been in touch with Mayawati and had advised her to act swiftly in this matter. Naidu had spoken to Mayawati and was slated to meet her in Lucknow on Sunday.

The BJP was particularly concerned as this scandal had provided the Opposition in the state with yet another reason to launch a scathing attack against the Mayawati government.

It was also keen to defuse the situation soon given the strained relations between the coalition partners. Any further mishandling of this issue would have only worsened the situation.

Commenting on the opposition reaction, Naqvi stated it was ironical that the Samajwadi Party and the Congress were out to exploit the situation for narrow political gains despite the fact that their leadership had earlier, on so many occasions, not only remained aloof to the demand of morality but shamelessly gone all out to shield and protect those involved in various crimes and scandals.

5,Punjab govt increases fire cess in local bodies,"CHANDIGARH: The Punjab government has enhanced fire cess in all the local bodiesâ€“municipal corporations, nagar councils and nagar panchayats â€“ which have fire brigades under them.

According to a notification, the fire cess has been imposed on all the buildings, shops, and factories and the rate of cess is directly proportional to the degree of vulnerability to fire.

All the buildings, godowns, and shops, where inflammable material is stored, would pay fire cess at the rate of 10 per cent of the house tax, while other shops and factories would be levied only half the amount (just five per cent of house tax). The high rising buildings with height more than 36 feet would pay an addition two percent of house tax.

6,BJP criticises arrest of 5 Wimpy's employees,"NEW DELHI: The arrest of five senior employees of global fast food chain Wimpyâ€™s by the Punjab police in connection with a corruption case against a top aide of former chief minister and Akali Dal chief Parkash Singh Badal took a political turn on Monday with his ally BJP flaying the â€œarbitraryâ€� action was reminiscent of the emergency days.

BJP leader V K Malhotra told reporters here that â€œthis is a very arbitrary manner in which the Punjab government has acted and that it is similar to what had taken place during emergency in 1975.â€� He said the arrests only â€œshows that they (Punjab government) are doing so for political vendetta.â€�

The five were arrested in a case of corruption and alleged owning of assets disproportionate to known sources of income registered against OSD of Badal on August 29 last.

7,Documents under probe swapped in govt office,"MUMBAI: Shouldn''t a government office that is supposed to watch over the affairs of 400,000 charity trusts in Maharashtra be vigilant enough to at least keep vital documents safe? Shockingly enough, the answer is noâ€”as Qamar Sadruddin Qazi, a trustee of the Anjuman Taraquiwa Tanzeem Achra, discovered to his detriment.

In the midst of a long-running feud with a breakaway faction of the trust headed by Prof A.A. Kazi, Mr Qazi applied in March to the charity commissioner''s office for fresh copies of a no-confidence motion passed against him in 1999. On receiving the papers two days later, he discovered to his horror that two vital documents had been substituted.

The missing documents were by no means innocuous. In fact, one of them was under investigation by the Dongri police on the orders of the Mazgaon court. This documentâ€”201 signatures of trust members who''d allegedly voted for the no-confidence motionâ€”was completely spurious, said Mr Qazi, who pointed out some of the holes therein: six purported signatories were bedridden at the time of the election, ten were living abroad, four were minors, six were fictitious, six were duplicated, and four were dead.

Mr Qazi''s suspicions of forgery were borne out by the report of Mahesh Wagh, a handwriting expert and additional chief state examiner of documents in the CID. The police, on their part, interrogated 46 signatories, of whom 32 denied having attended the meeting at all. The police also went to Room 13, Essac Manzil, where the meeting was allegedly held, and stated that the 230-sq-ft room could not possibly hold 201 people at one time. A prima facie case that forgery had taken place was then made out.

It was this controversial list of signatures that the charity commissioner''s office accepted from Prof Kazi along with his request to replace the old trustees with his own people. This process of replacing names (known as a change report) has been known to take years, and even decades, in this office. Yet, Prof Kazi''s change report was processed in a miraculous five weeks. Mr Qazi''s appeal against this, backed by police documents and other proof of fraud has been â€˜under investigation'' for the last four years.

How this investigation will now proceed without the critical document is something that only the charity commissioner''s office can answer. While the Kazi vs Qazi accusations and counter-accusations continue, the internal inquiry into the missing papers, set up after Mr Qazi complained on May 6, is almost nonchalant in its tone. ""It goes without say both the Exhibits came to be substituted,"" says the report prepared by deputy charity commissioner D.B. Mahale. ""..It is rather difficult to find out that who is the mischief-monger who played the mischief in substituting Exhibit 5 and Exhibit 6..In my opinion, the arrow of doubt goes to the direction towards the party which would be benefited in view of substitution of both exhibits.""

Apart from the fact that vague sentences like ""the party which benefits"" indict no one, the report is equally casual about the office''s own role in such vital matters as the substitution of documents. Will the charity commissioner''s office accept responsibility? That is the question itâ€”or the law ministry, under which it fallsâ€”needs to answer.

8,Clubs urge govt to let them maintain RB Gardens,"AMRITSAR: The management of three recreational clubs, Amritsar Club, Lumsdon Club and Service Club situated in the historical Ram Bagh Gardens and currently facing courtâ€™s eviction orders, on Monday held a joint press conference to impress upon the government that their shifting from the present location would ruin the garden. They urged the government to let them maintain the garden, as it would help check the comings and goings of bad elements.

Notably, the clubs had received notices from the Municipal Corporation (MC) for vacating the club premises following the Punjab and Haryana High Courtâ€™s decision in the wake of a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Amritsar Vikas Manch, alleging misuse of historical buildings. The clubs had then approached the high court, which ordered for maintaining the status quo and fixed the next date for hearing for July 3.

Arun Verma and Sarabjit Singh Sandhu, presidents of Lumsden and Service Clubs, respectively, and Lalit Chandok, vice-president of Amritsar Club, suggested that instead of shifting the clubs, the government should invoke Section 6 of the Punjab Ancient and Historical Monuments and Archaeological Remains and Sites Act, 1964, seeking clubsâ€™ involvement in the maintenance of lawns surrounding the protected monuments.

They also suggested that certain norms, rules and by-laws could be framed to regulate the working of clubs with respect to holding of marriage parties, disposal of garbage, beautification of club boundaries, upkeep of the Ram Bagh Gardens, besides protecting the heritage sites.

They said that they paid huge revenue to the government in the form of excise duty, sales tax, electricity, water and sewerage charges, besides entertaining the elite class of the city and providing directly and indirectly employment to about 3,000 persons.

9,US national arrested for cheating,"NEW DELHI: The New Delhi district police have arrested a US national for allegedly cheating a multinational company. The accused, John Schofield, was arrested from Bangalore by a special team of Delhi police on June 15.

According to the police, on June 14, the chief operating officer of GEO Connect Limited had reported that one John Sheffield approached their company and claimed that he was the chairman of a US based company called Tritech Information Strategies. He further claimed that he was involved in the business of call centres with reputed companies.

The Deputy commissioner of police (New Delhi district), Manoj Lall said, ""The accused induced the company into having a call centre service agreement. GEO started offering call centre services to the accusedâ€™s company in 2002.""

The police said that in January this year, the accused had come to India and handed over a cheque of US $ 2,00,002 to GEO and the company continued to provide him the service. The company came to know that the cheque was dishonoured because the account mentioned in it had already been closed.

A case was registered at the Connaught Place police station. ""We learnt that the accused was in Bangalore and a police party was dispatched to the city, where the accused was arrested.""

10,Delayed desilting irks Delhi government,"NEW DELHI: The Municipal Corporation of Delhi''s (MCD) annual exercise of desilting drains has come under severe criticism from the Delhi government.

Not only has the work overshot its deadline but it seems likely to remain a half-hearted attempt.

Desilting of drains has come to be accepted as a farce where the civic agency churns out figures of work accomplished for two months but any illusion that silt is actually removed is dispelled with the first showers.

Every year heavy rains lead to water-logged roads and streets.

This year the story has been no different. According to Delhi government sources, barely 18 per cent of work has been done.

â€˜â€˜Desilting work should have finished by now but every zone has 3 or 4 drains where work has been completed,â€™â€™ the source said. Work to desilt Delhiâ€™s 1,166 drains usually begins by April and is supposed to finish by the first week of June.

Last year MCD had taken out 6 lakh metric tonnes of silt by the June-end spending. This year however even this delay seems to be an improvement.

There seem to be no clear reasons for the lackadaisical attitude. In Shahdara North and South, tenders to desilt drains have been invited twice but no contractor is willing to do the work due to non-payment of last yearâ€™s arrears.

â€˜â€˜Contractors do not want to take up the work because payments for last yearâ€™s work are still stuck,â€™â€™ a MCD official said. But the MCD has not come up with satisfactory excuses for the other zones.

â€˜â€˜Desilting work has never been in such a bad shape,â€™â€™ said a senior government official.

Work in the other zones is also at an all time low.

According to the official, urban development minister Dr A K Walia even gave the civic agency officials a severe tongue-lashing on this issue.

On being asked, Dr Walia said, â€˜â€˜I am dissatisfied with the pace of work. It has been very slow this year.â€™â€™

12,Partyless council polls likely,"PATNA: A move is on to keep all the political parties away from fielding their official candidates in the ensuing polls for 24 state legislative council seats reserved for the representatives of local bodies.

A ""near consensus"" on keeping the political parties away from the polls was reached in a meeting at the residence of state assembly Speaker Sadanand Singh on Monday evening which was attended by council chairman Jabir Hussain.

""It was a preliminary meeting to persuade the political parties to keep the seats meant for the representatives of local bodies free from party politics,"" Sadanand Singh said, adding that two rounds of talks would be held on Tuesday and Wednesday to work out the modalities.

Others who attended the meeting were water resources minister Jagdanand Singh (representing the state government and ruling RJD), Nand Kishore Yadav (BJP), Upendra Prasad Kushwaha, Mangani Lal Mandal (Samata Party), Badri Narayan Lal (CPI), Ganesh Prasad Yadav (JD-U) and Ram Jatan Sinha (Congress). The ground for this meeting was prepared by the meeting of the assembly Speaker and the council chairman with the leaders of different political parties.

The leaders of various political parties were of the view that the ""independent status"" of the MLCs representing local bodies should be retained as the panchayat and municipal elections were not held on ""party basis"".

However, the leaders, cutting across the party line, expressed their concern over the alleged move by criminals, musclemen and people with money power to enter the upper House through these elections. ""If political parties field their candidates, they will be forced to pick up persons having muscle and money power -- a candidate who is ready to spend more than Rs 20 lakh,"" said a leader.

Jagdanand Singh is reported to have suggested that all political parties should make a joint appeal to the electorate to vote for ""able candidates having no criminal record"". A committee consisting of Sadanand Singh, Jabir Hussain, Jagdanand Singh, Nand Kishore Yadav, Mangani Lal Mandal and Ganesh Prasad Yadav was formed which will meet on Tuesday to work out the modalities.

Another meeting of the presidents and other leaders of all political parties is to be held on Wednesday.

13,BJP welcomes SNDP's proposal to form a political party,"NEDUMBASSERY: BJP welcomed SNDP''s proposal to form a political party, Union Minister of State for Defence O Rajagopal said on Monday.

Speaking to reporters at Cochin International Airport here, he said he did not agree with the statement from some corners that SNDP''s initiative to form the political party would ignite communal enmity in the state.

Earlier, political parties were formed on the basis of ideology, but later, some leaders constituted political parties for their existence, he said, adding, many communal organisations had direct control over political parties at present.

Kerala has only less than 25 per cent of the land as forests when the minimum required forest land in the state was fixed as 30 per cent, he said, adding strong organised groups which had encroached the forest lands in the state, were now trying to possess forest land in the name of tribals.

Only five hectares of forest land were needed to provide facilities to the pilgrims at Sabarimala, but the state government had asked for 20 hectares of land, he pointed out.

14,Couple arrested for running chit racket,"HYDERABAD: A couple who cheated several employees of Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited by collecting money from them in the name of a fake chit company, was arrested on Monday.

M V Kamala Kumari, 37, an employee at the Saifabad Telephone Bhavan and her husband Chinta Subba Rao, 39, working at HMT Hyderabad were arrested by officials of Central Crime Station following several complaints from BSNL employees.

Once they had a large number of BSNL employees as their clientele, and an amount of nearly Rs 45 lakh, the couple diverted the money to buy two flats in Miyapur and land in several places including Chirala and Amplapuram. When the customers started asking about the chit prize money, Kamala Kumari tendered resignation to her employers and tried to escape along with her husband.

Upon receiving several complaints from the cheated BSNL employees, CCS conducted initial investigations and were able to track down the couple to their uncleâ€™s house in Gandhinagar, Rangareddy district. The couple have admitted to cheating in the name of a fake chit company, a police press release on Monday said.

Law and parliamentary affairs minister D.B. Chandre Gowda told this paper: ""I appeal to students and parents not to get carried away by gimmicks of these private colleges. The government has taken a decision in accordance with the Supreme Court order and issued a notification. We have the right and authority to do so.""

Asked if the government would direct universities to withdraw affiliation of colleges and not recognise their degrees, Gowda said it''s too early to talk on these lines. ""When the issue comes to that, we will take a decision.""

College backtracks: After Tumkur-based Siddaganga Institute of Technology chose to walk out of Comed and adhere to the government''s CET-based admission system, Dayananda Sagar College of Engineering followed suit and has decided to admit students to I year BE through CET 2003-2004.

Sri Jagadguru Chandrashekaranatha Institute of Technology, Chikballapur, said the institution has withdrawn from Comed and will follow government guidelines for BE courses.

Comed, however, did not attach too much importance to a few private colleges walking out of the consortium. ""These colleges have walked out because of threat by the government and VTU. VTU V-C has threatened that our degrees will not be recognised,"" Comed vice-chairman M.R. Jayaram, said.
