0,PM inaugurates development schemes,"LUCKNOW: Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee inaugurated a host of development schemes, despite his indisposition, on Sunday. Arriving a little behind schedule, the prime minister, clearly struggling to walk up the high staircase at the LDA stadium in Aliganj, inaugurated the schemes which included laying of the foundation stone of regional science city and that of the Sadar-Mawaiya railway overbridge. He also inaugurated six sub-stations (at Nadan Mahal road, Ikka stand, Niralanagar, Indralok, Rajajipuram-II, Chandan nagar).

By pressing of a button the PM also dedicated the Rajrishi Purushottam Das Tandon Tourism Bhawan (at Gomtinagar) and the education and administrative block of the Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan. The regional science city is expected to come up at a cost of Rs 20 crores, the sub-stations have cost Rs 14.80 crores, the cost of the tourism centre is pegged at Rs 9.76 crores, the railway overbridge Rs 23.64 crores, the national culture centre at Rs 3 crores and Avadh Hat at Rs 2 crores.

Thanking the prime minister for his parental approach towards the city, urban development minister Lalji Tandon said that the railway overbridge would come in handy in a big way in decongesting traffic on the city roads. The railway overbridge, to be built by the railways, would be 24 metres long while the access way to it would be 784 metres long and would be built by the UP Bridge Corporation.

The Paryatan Bhawan at Gomtinagar, dedicated to public by Vajpayee on Sunday, is built on an area of 7630 square metres and is located at the Vipin Khand. In his brief speech, union minister for culture and tourism Jagmohan said that since UP was so rich in culture and tourist spots he would give all possible help to the state in developing hitherto neglected tourist spots.

Vajpayee, in his brief speech, promised the gathering to come and speak to them sometime soon and congratulated them on the vast strides Lucknow was taking in development. Earlier, chief minister Mayawati welcomed the PM and pointed out various schemes launched by her government to beautify the city which Vajpayee represents in parliament.

1,Power staff-govt talks fail,"LUCKNOW: With the government having imposed a ban on the proposed October 24 strike and the power employees determined to go ahead with the same, the two rounds of talk between the Uttar Pradesh Power Technical Employees Joint Action Committee and government officials on Sunday yielded no results. The talks will continue on Monday.

The first round of talks was held between the power employees and the principal secretary energy and the CMD UPPCL. The second round was held with chief secretary BS Bagga. With both the sides unwilling to see the otherâ€™s view point the stalemate continued.

Committee members Shailendra Dubey, AK Singh, AK Verma and Captan Singh said they asked the government officials to honour the agreement of January 25, 2000 as also the pact of June 6, 2002 which had provided for a post-reform review. They also demanded that the decision on the constitution of the four distribution companies and the handing over of KESCO to the NTPC be taken back.

The government, on its part, maintained that the decision on the discoms could not be taken back.

2,No threat to my govt: Mayawati,"LUCKNOW: UP chief minister Mayawati on Sunday ruled out any threat to her five-month-old coalition government in the wake of dissident activity within its major coalition partner, the BJP, after the recent cabinet expansion. â€œThere is no crisis for the coalition government and it is firmly in the saddle without any threat from any quarter,â€� Mayawati asserted in an informal meeting with newspersons at Amausi airport where she had gone to see off Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee.

Dismissing the statement of Samajwadi Party chief Mualyam Singh Yadav, in which he had said that he was in touch with the BJP dissident MLAs, as a â€œfigment of imaginationâ€�, Mayawati claimed that her government would complete its full term. â€œWe are here to stay longer than expected,â€� she added.

4,"Extremists hampering development, says Marandi","HAZARIBAG: Jharkhand chief minister Babulal Marandi said here on Saturday that he will launch a campaign this month to raise public awareness about the extremist menace which is affecting proper development of the state.

The Jharkhand government is committed to construct roads, provide irrigation facilities to farmers and jobs to unemployed youths but such works are affected in extremist-dominated areas of the state, he said and informed as a part of his programme, he has begun his yatra from Garhwa district which is considered to be a hotbed of extremist activities. He claimed he received very good response there.

""Public awareness is needed, otherwise extremists would continue extorting contractors and corrupt officials would demand commission from needy people,"" he said and requested people to cooperate with him in eliminating corruption and pave way for speedy development.

Marandi claimed the government has contained extremism in the state to a great extent. Many dreaded extremists have been arrested by the police and huge quantity of arms and ammunition have been recovered.

More than 50 bunkers, built by the extremists, were destroyed recently, he added.

He said the government would not bow down before the extremists despite their recent offensive against policemen and public.

The CM also said his offer to extremists is open and all possible help would be provided to them if they surrender.

He said the revised reservation quota for Adivasis, Dalits, and OBCs will be restricted to 50 per cent and would not be revised again as per the Jharkhand High Court order. ""If anybody creates obstruction, launches agitation and affects normal life he would be punished,"" he said.

The CM also announced that with a view to strengthen the police force in the state, the government has received clearance from Centre for setting up of India Reserve Battalion having 1,000 policemen. The unit would be set up in Jamtara district of Jharkhand.

He said 50 per cent cost of this battalion would be borne by the Centre and the remaining 50 per cent by the Jharkhand government.

He ruled out shifting of Jharkhand police 7 battalion from Hazaribag and said it will continue to function from Hazaribag for which land has been allotted by the government near the Charwa Dam.

He also said the Jharkhand Military Police Training Centre functioning at Kadma of Hazaribag district will continue to function from the same venue.

â€œThe military police training centre will remain at Kadma and there is no plan to shift it to some other place,â€� Marandi said.

5,Centre seeks waterways proposals from Bihar govt,"PATNA: With the Centre allowing the Bihar government to submit projects worth Rs 1,000 crore to link panchayats situated on the banks of the rivers flowing into the Ganga with the inland waterways transport system, the prospect of development of a strategic alternative to the railway and road transport systems in the state has brightened considerably during the 10th Five-Year Plan.

The Centre would bear 90 per cent of the cost of these projects and the state government the rest 10 per cent.

Earlier, the Planning Commission had approved Rs 109 crore for the state for linking these panchayats with the inland waterways transport system during the 10th Five-Year Plan, and the Bihar government had decided to implement the scheme from the next financial year. But at the meeting of the Inland Waterways Transport Development Council held in Delhi on October 17 and 18, Bihar transport minister Awadh Bihari Chaudhary and transport secretary N K Sinha proposed to submit projects worth Rs 1,000 crore in this connection, saying that the entire North Bihar is flood-prone. Union shipping minister Ved Prakash Goyal, while giving the state a green light, said that the Centre would actively consider its proposals.

Sinha said the state government would now like to implement the scheme from the current financial year. The transport department would submit to the Centre projects worth Rs 200 crore by November-end and those worth Rs 800 crore by March next. The state would initiate steps to link 400 panchayats situated on the banks of the Kosi, Gandak and Sone to the inland waterways transport system by developing feeder routes provided the Centre approves the projects worth Rs 200 crore for the current financial year. The government is, however, yet to identify the panchayats to be brought under the scheme, he maintained.

Although senior transport department officials claim that the permission for submitting projects worth Rs 1,000 crore is a major achievement, it is unlikely to be a cakewalk for the state since the Planning Commission has earmarked only Rs 6,668 crore for the whole country in the 10th Five-Year Plan under the inland waterways transport services head. Obviously, the Centre would first have to increase the allocation before clearing projects worth Rs 1,000 crore for Bihar.

Meanwhile, the Inland Waterways Authority of India has decided to establish a Rs 25-crore inland waterways terminal at Gaighat in Patna City. Goyal would lay the terminalâ€™s foundation stone on October 30. The Gaighat terminal would act as a port providing for the loading and unloading of goods packed in containers reaching there from panchayats situated on the banks of different rivers.

6,"Centre must arrest Togadia, demands Cong","HYDERABAD: Leaders and activists of the AP Congress Committee (PCC) and AP Youth Congress staged dharnas in front of the Vishwa Hindu Parishadâ€™s (VHP) city office on Sunday to protest Praveen Togadiaâ€™s alleged remarks on AICC president Sonia Gandhi.

Demanding the immediate arrest of Togadia for making â€œderogatory and vulgarâ€� remarks, Congress activists burnt the effigies of the VHP leader. About 200 activists of the Youth Congress, led by AICC secretary V Hanumanth Rao and state Youth Congress president T Venkata Rao were taken into preventive custody when they staged a dharna before the VHP office. They were released later.

Speaking to reporters, PCC president M Satyanarayana Rao alleged that perturbed over their diminishing popularity, the BJP leaders had unleashed a systematic campaign against Sonia Gandhi, initially using Tamil Nadu chief minister J Jayalalithaa and now the VHP.

â€œThis only shows their frustration over the partyâ€™s defeat in the elections in one state after the other,â€� the PCC chief said.

Stating that the BJP leaders were trying to raise the communal slogan, the Congress leader said that the silence of Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee and his deputy L K Advani over Togadiaâ€™s remarks only show that they were encouraging communal elements, which were perilous to the safety of the minority.

â€œIf the VHP can make derogatory remarks against the leader of the biggest party, how can any one be assured of the safety of minorities,â€� he said, demanding that the Centre immediately take steps to arrest Togadia for his remarks.

In a separate statement, CLP leader Y S Rajasekhara Reddy termed the remarks as unfortunate.

10,Gujarat Cong demands Togadia's arrest,"SURAT/Ahmedabad: Gujarat Pradesh Congress Committee general secretary Rizwan Usmani demanded that VHP international general secretary Pravin Togadia be put behind bars under Pota for his alleged provocative speech at a meeting in the Varachha area of the city last Wednesday.

In a memorandum submitted to district collector M K Das and city police commissioner V K Gupta, Congress leaders demanded that Surat police register a case for his inflammatory speeches in which he had said that about 200 youth are willing to fight against Islamic terrorists as suicide bombers.

Former state minister Girish Parmar lashed out at Chief Minister Narendra Modi and Togadia and demanded that they ""hold their tongues"". ""Togadia and Modi have stooped to using cheap and obscene language which is unfortunate for the five crore cultured Gujaratis,"" he said.

He accused the VHP of having ""extorted money from Hindus for relief of the riot-affected, but not extended even a paisa in that direction"".

""Is Togadia collecting this money for his Mumbai hospital or the Bapunagar one?"" Parmar said. Reacting to Modi''s utterances at the Gaurav Yatra, Parmar said, ""why does Modi have to wait till the elections for wiping out the traders of death, he can do that right now.""

Earlier in the day, a large number of Congress workers assembled in front of the Surat collectorate and set an effigy of Togadia on fire to lodge their protest against his derogatory remarks against Sonia Gandhi.

Congress leaders of the city also expressed their deep anguish at the language used by Togadia against Gandhi in his recent speech at Bhuj and demanded an apology from him.

11,SP making efforts to replace Mayawati govt,"NEW DELHI: The Samajwadi Party has admitted that it is making serious efforts to replace the Mayawati government in Uttar Pradesh by enlisting support from within the BJP dissident camp with the help of Kalyan Singh.

After a meeting of the partyâ€™s parliamentary board here on Monday, its leaders confirmed reports of Mulayam Singh Yadavâ€™s meeting with expelled BJP leader and former chief minister Kalyan Singh regarding the possibility of an alternative government in UP.

â€˜â€˜If former BJP leader Shankersinh Vaghela can lead the Congress in Gujarat, we can also do business with Kalyan Singh,â€™â€™ SP leaders Ram Gopal Yadav and Amar Singh said.

Striking a decisive note, they said in the unfolding political scenario in UP, the balance could tilt in favour of those opposed to the BJP-BSP combine if the Congress agreed to back such a move. â€˜â€˜Everything now depends on the Congress; the day Sonia Gandhi takes a decision, the Mayawati government will fall,â€™â€™ they asserted.

Asked if the SP was into a toppling game, the SP leaders remarked: â€˜â€˜There is no need; the BJP-BSP coalition government will fall under the weight of its own contradictions.â€™â€™

In a veiled threat to the Congress, they said the SP had already prepared a list of candidates for every assembly constituency in Gujarat. â€˜â€˜If there are talks with the Congress, we can negotiate the number of seats we actually contest. If there is no dialogue, then we will fight all the seats,â€™â€™ the leaders said.

Desperate for Congress support, the SP, in fact, adopted a carrot-and-stick approach. The two SP leaders deplored VHP functionary Pravin Togadiaâ€™s remarks about Soniaâ€™s Italian roots and said that the issue of the Congress leaderâ€™s foreign origins had been settled by the Supreme Court opinion on her eligibility as a candidate. â€˜â€˜It is for the Congress to decide who should be its prime ministerial candidate, we have no problem if Sonia becomes PM,â€™â€™ they said.

The parliamentary board left it to Mulayam to decide the party candidates for the biennial Rajya Sabha elections from Uttar Pradesh.

12,Conversions a political act: Togadia,"MADURAI: Terming conversions as a â€œpolitical activityâ€�, VHP international general secretary Praveen Togadia on Monday said it would destroy Hindu society and the Indian nation.

â€˜â€˜Conversion was a political activity and not religious as claimed by the Christians and no society would allow itself to be destroyed by giving a free hand to Christians to carry out conversions,â€™â€™ he told reporters.

Referring to the Tamil Nadu governmentâ€™s ordinance on conversions, Togadia said Christians should not worry about it if they were not resorting to conversion by coercion or by fraudulent means.

Stating that he felt the ordinance had been brought to maintain the pluralistic and secular character of the country, the VHP leader said Tamil Nadu chief minister Jayalalithaa also had felt the same way.

â€˜â€˜This did not mean that the BJP and the AIADMK are coming closer or the VHP and the AIADMK are coming closer,â€™â€™ he clarified.

Asked if the government could have justified the need for the ordinance by undertaking a study about conversions in Tamil Nadu, Togadia said: â€˜â€˜The Justice Venugopal Commission (set up in the aftermath of the Mandaikadu communal violence in 1980s) has already stressed the need to stop conversions.â€™â€™

On apprehensions expressed by minorities that the ordinance might be misused, he said: â€˜â€˜Any law can be misused. We canâ€™t be without laws. Without laws, there would be anarchy.â€™â€™

He said the VHP would soon launch a programme to create awareness throughout Tamil Nadu with the help of religious mutt heads about the anti-conversion ordinance.

13,VSNL prunes investment in Tata Tele,"NEW DELHI: A committee appointed by the Tatas-managed VSNL has recommended that the company should buy only 19.9 per cent stake for Rs 835.80 crore in Tata Teleservices Ltd (TTSL), which is significantly lower than what VSNL had planned earlier. The investment will be spread over seven years, of which Rs 636.80 crore would be invested in the next four years. The development has resolved the controversy that erupted earlier this year, in which communications minister Pramod Mahajan opposed the Tatas' move to invest up to Rs 1,200 crore for a 25 per cent stake. Mahajan called for greater transparency by the Tatas on TTSL valuation and investment plan. The Tatas had announced the investment plan soon after acquiring stake in VSNL through a government disinvestment, followed by an offer process. The government still holds 26 per cent of VSNL. ""I am satisfied with the committee's report,"" Mahajan told The Times of India. ""I don't want to proclaim it as a victory or defeat for anybody. I want to end this controversy and wish best of luck to the new management,"" he added. A Tatas spokesman in Mumbai said, meanwhile, that the board has accepted the committee's suggestion, which was based on TTSL's valuation done by ICICI Securities (I-Sec). He said the lowered investment was on account of the completion of the TTSL deal to buy Hughes Tele in Maharashtra. ""TTSL requirement now is for just about this much,"" said the spokesman. ""I-Sec's TTSL valuation was above par, although the company has decided to sell the stake at par. This is a good buy for VSNL,"" he added. VSNL, the country's international long distance (ILD) provider, is facing immense pressure on revenues and profits because of the entry of private players in the ILD sector and a drastic cut in call rates. It announced on Monday that net profit had dipped by over 33 per cent to just about Rs 246 crore during Q2 ended September 30, 2002, compared to the same period last financial year. For the first half of 2002-03, the dip in net was about 31 per cent at Rs 507 crore against the first six months of last fiscal. Similarly, Q2 operating income this fiscal was down 21.78 per cent at Rs 1,247 crore against Rs 1,595.4 crore during the same quarter last year. The six-month sales were down 16 per cent at Rs 2,621 crore, over last fiscal's first half revenues of Rs 3,123.7 crore. Apart from increased competition and reduced call rates, VSNL is struggling against network interconnection rates with BSNL, and has moved the telecom regulator, TRAI, on the issue. It seems that the commercial terms, even if less stringent than being offered now, will put further pressure on VSNL's results.
