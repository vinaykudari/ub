1,Fatehabad byelection will be Waterloo for Cong: Chautala,"AMBALA: The ruling Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) president and Haryana chief minister Om Prakash Chautala on Saturday said that the May 21 byelections to Fatehabad constituency would prove to be a â€˜Waterlooâ€™ for the state Congress.

â€˜â€˜All the candidates of opposition parties will loose their deposits in the Fatehabad bypolls,â€™â€™ Chautala claimed.

Talking to reporters here, he said that Haryana Congress chief Bhajan Lal â€˜â€˜usually challengedâ€™â€™ the INLD leaders, â€˜â€˜but now he has got the opportunity to prove his worth in this byelectionâ€™â€™. Claiming that the Congress had already lost its base in the state, he said that â€˜â€˜Bhajan Lal will have to face humiliation in this byelection, as his nephew Dhura Ram will get defeatedâ€™â€™.

Chautala said that INLD would contest this by election on the development and achievements of his government.

On INLDâ€™s alliance partner BJPâ€™s decision to field its candidate for the bypolls, he said such a decision will â€˜â€˜directly benefit the Congressâ€™â€™. Asked if any SARS case had been reported in Haryana, he said the state was free from any such case, but added that two suspected cases in Gurgaon had turned out to be negative.

Replying to a question, he said that the procurement of the wheat was going on well in the state and the farmers had been getting the MSP price without any difficulty.

2,She picks grains for her family's survival,"PATIALA: Ten-year-old Rani has not been going to school for the last two weeks, though everyday she starts from her home in the morning with her school bag. This is not something strange, for she has done this earlier also. She carries her school bag sans books and heads straight to the grain market with her younger brother and two other companions following her in tow.

Once inside the market, the ritual of separating grains from husk begins. Everyday by evening, she alone manages to collect around three to five kgs of wheat. For her, this is more important than attending classes at school because within three to four weeks she would be able to collect around one quintal of wheat, meaning two monthsâ€™ food for her family.

Itâ€™s not always easy to pick grains. Though people at the market are sympathetic towards her plight and let her have her share, sometimes these very people shoo them away and prefer to sell it to persons who would do work on large-scale, says Rani.

She says she brooms the ground to collect scattered grains and at least then nobody stops her from doing so.

She is not the only one in this struggle to survive. Bachni, 78-yearold woman, also manages her two meals by collecting grains from this market. Bachni is a widow and has nobody to look after her. Many farmers know her personally as she has been coming to Amloh Mandi for the last many years.

Having pity on her miserable condition, some of the farmers also give her a handful of grains from their yield.

She says that she manages to pick around two and a half quintal of wheat every year. Keeping aside one quintal for herself, she sells the remaining to shopkeepers in her village to purchase other eatables. She says that during the paddy season also she manages to collect enough paddy to sustain her.

5,Stamp scam: Officers adopt wait and watch policy,"PUNE: Top police officers, against whom the government has announced disciplinary action for the mishandling of the stamp-paper scam investigation, seem to have adopted a wait-and-watch policy.

8,... And there once was a disinvestment commission,"LUCKNOW: Call it World Bank pressure or political will, very few will doubt the seriousness of Mayawati government about disinvestment. â€˜Better late than neverâ€™, most thought, when the state cabinet decided to set up a disinvestment committee early this month. But, is it the stateâ€™s first brush with divestment? Hardly.

There was a State Disinvestment Commission in UP that was functional between January 2000 and February 2002. The three-member commission was chaired by Ashok Chandra, a retired IAS officer. The two other members were GG Mehrotra, another retired IAS officer and AK Puri, retired GM, SBI.

Even before that, as early as 1990, in a one-off case of disinvestment, the state government divested the UP Cement Corporation and Auto Tractor Ltd. In the case of the former, though, the state government later bought back its shares. It is another matter that the corporation continued to operate in the red. Thereafter, as many as 10 regional development corporations were closed down by subsequent state governments. Among them were Martrico, Film Nigam and UP Brassware Corporation.

The first concrete initiative towards structured divestment, however, was taken by the Kalyan Singh government when the State Industrial Policy 1998 released by it stated that it would ensure functioning of public enterprises based on efficiency parameters, and envisaged privatisation of all public sector units in a phased manner, excepting those in the public utility sector. In pursuance of this policy, the government constituted a committee under the chief secretary to review the functioning of all the state public enterprises.

This committee finally gave its go-ahead for setting up of a State Disinvestment Commission, which was constituted on November 30, 1998. It, however, could get going only in January 2000, when Ram Prakash Gupta took over as the chief minister.

The commission was to work under the guidelines of the Uttar Pradesh Public Enterprises/ Corporation Reform Policy - 2000 and was entrusted with the task of recommending the plan of action to facilitate restructuring, re-organisation, privatisation and even closure of public enterprises.

When the commission began functioning, there were 45 functioning PSEs with an investment of Rs 24,753 crore, which had an accumulated net loss of Rs 3,109 crore. According to sources in the Bureau of Public Enterprises, 27 out of these 45 PSEs had been referred to the commission, which made a detailed study of their viability and then submitted recommendations.

Although the bureau officials are tight-lipped about what the recommendations were, it is learnt that the commission was overwhelmingly in favour of getting ruthless with the sick PSEs. But, there is a catch here. The brief of the commission limited its scope greatly. To begin with, PSEs in the energy sector had not been referred to the commission and neither were those belonging to the social sector and formed under special statuette.

Then the three PSEs, which had already been referred to the BIFR, also did not come under the purview of the commission. According to a government official, out of the total government expenditure on PSEs, 85-90 per cent goes to the PSEs which belong to the above category. â€œMost of them are loss-making, but were not referred to the commission for understandable reasons,â€� he quips, adding, â€œSo, what the commission was left with was small sick enterprises, large in number, but consuming a meagre 10 per cent of government expenditureâ€�.

So, with the notification for the setting up of the new committee having already been issued, will the recommendations of the earlier commission be of any help? â€œItâ€™s too early to comment,â€� says principal secretary, planning, Anees Ansari. â€œThe notification has just been issued and we will decide on it when all the parties concerned sit together.â€� The first meeting of the committee is slated for April 29.

9,Cong not to take part in rally,"PATNA: The Congress has washed its hands of the ""Maharailla"" scheduled to be held here by its ally RJD on April 30. ""There will be no participation of the Congress in the RJD rally. We have nothing to do with the lathi rally,"" stressed state Congress chief Shakeel Ahmad while speaking to TNN on Saturday before presiding over the partyâ€™s state executive committee meeting held after a gap of six months.

Many Congress leaders expressed their annoyance over the statement made by a fellow Congressman and former MLA Dilip Rai. Rai, in his statement, had claimed that he would send two lakh lathis from Samastipur. When Rai began to move his resolution stressing that Congress workers should participate in the RJD rally with lathis, he was virtually shouted down.

""If you want to join the RJD, you can do so,"" Umakant Singh told him while asking Shakeel Ahmad to take strong action against Congress leaders issuing statements in favour of the RJD rally.

10,Oppn sees sinister trend in rally,"PATNA: As preparations for the April 30 rally of the RJD have been peaking up, leaders of the opposition parties have begun to remind people of sinister trend unfolding in its wake.

While CPI has pointed to undemocratic behaviour of a few RJD leaders, leader of the opposition Sushil Kumar Modi has seen wilful distortion of the state''s rural culture in the rhetoric used by the RJD leaders to validate the use of lathis during the rally. Besides, former chief minister and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Jagannath Mishra said ''trishul'' had become symbol of communsalism, and ""lathi of casteism"".

According to CPI state secretary Jalaluddin Ansari, RJD MLA Samrat Choudhary and his supporters had occupied Miller School ground and were getting bamboos and tents erected to give shelter to RJD men there, even as CPI had got the ground reserved for its Bharat Janjagaran Yatra meeting to be held there on April 27. ""This amounted to gross political corruption and also a violation of democratic rights,"" Ansari said.

He referred to hijacking of buses, jeeps and other vehicles carrying daily passengers by RJD men in different parts of the state to ferry people to Patna for the April 30 rally. RJD men are forcing passengers to leave such vehicles, he added. Ansari even pointed to the case of his party''s senior leader and ex-MLA Ambika Prasad. RJD men at Khagaria stopped a jeep in which both Prasad and Sanjay Yadav were travelling in connection with the Bharat Jan Jagaran Yatra. Their jeep could be released only after the intervention of the brother of the local RJD MLA, as Prasad went to the latter''s house to complain about the incident.

Modi made a scathing attack on excise minister and senior RJD leader Shivanand Tiwari for attacking BJP leader and former Union minister Pramod Mahajan. While Tiwari had no words to react on the fast unfolding story of Atul Prakash kidnapping case, even as RJD''s known and prominent figures were involved in it, he has chosen to break his silence by criticising Mahajan to keep his supremo Laloo Prasad Yadav in good humour, Modi said.

Incidentally, Tiwari, who is also RJD spokesman, had ridiculed Mahajan for criticisng the call to bring lathis at the RJD-sponsored rally. ""Mahajan was displaying a sword while criticising the lathi"", Tiwari said on Friday before mediapersons, referring to the photographs appearing in the local newspapers showing Mahajan with a sword along with other BJP leaders at a function held on Thursday. Tiwari added that elite sections were ridiculing the lathis. ""They ridicule everything that is Indian,"" Tiwari said, and asserted that there was an age-old tradition in Bihar to carry lathis.

On Saturday, Modi took Tiwari head on and said that RJD leaders had undermined Gandhi by depicting lathis used by him as a weapon to drive away the British from India, and by equating his lathi with that of Laloo and his men. RJD men''s bid to equate lathi with the rural culture and society of the state, too, was a cover for the use of lathis during elections to shoo away voters of other political parties, he added. He said in its 13-year rule, the Laloo-Rabri regime had ignored interests and needs of rural people. He added Laloo would be humiliated in the same way as Saddam Hussain was done by Iraqis.

Meanwhile, Samata Legislature Party leader Upendra Kushwaha has urged the governor to initiate measures to prevent people from coming to the rally with ""lathis"" . The rally could lead to a civil war, he said.

11,BUVP threatens Bharat bandh on June 2,"LUCKNOW: Following the decision made by 16 states to impose VAT from June, the Bharatiya Udyog Vyapar Mandal (BUVP) has threatened a â€˜Bharat bandhâ€™ on June 2.

Addressing a press conference, general secretary BUVM, Banwarilal Kanchal said that traders will not allow VAT in its present form to be imposed in the country. He said they are also opposing the imposition of excise duty on small industries.

The decision to impose an eight per cent excise duty on packaged edible oils and vanaspati ghee went totally against the earlier decision to make branded and packed edible oil mandatory, which was done to control the trade of adulterated oil that was the cause of diseases such as dropsy. If the government was incurring a loss in case excise duty was withdrawn, it could increase the import duty of palm oil from 65 per cent to the earlier 75 per cent, Kanchal said.

Hosiery, ready-made garments, powerlooms, blankets, chikan and the bidi industries that produced goods worth Rs 1 crore should be excused from the net of excise duty as earlier, he said.

Concerning VAT, Kanchal said that wherever VAT had been imposed, all other forms of taxation had been withdrawn, unlike in India, where there were six forms of taxation including VAT (excise duty, mandi shulk, entry tax, service tax and chungi). Since the system would affect the countryâ€™s economy for another 100 years, the government should have consulted traders too, but they had not done so, he regretted.

The traders had therefore decided to gherao finance ministers on May 15 and stage dharnas between May 22-31. On May 20, they will present their demands to all the elected leaders. On May 21, they will form a human chain to press for their demands with regard to the improvement in the trade tax system. They would then launch a non-cooperation movement on June 1, and on June 2, go for a Bharat bandh, Kanchal said.

12,Bankmen criticise NDA govt's policies,"PATNA: Railway minister Nitish Kumar faced a piquant situation at the joint inaugural session of the 16th conference of All India Central Bank Employees'' Federation and the sixth conference of All India Central Bank Officers'' Association here on Saturday when ""comrades"" of the bank trade unions started attacking the policies of NDA government at the Centre.

""Earlier, I failed to understand what prompted the organisers to choose me for inaugurating this function. I have never been associated with the labour movement. After reaching the venue, I realised that you people were in search of a Union minister in order to take him to task,"" was how Nitish began his speech.

""Welcoming"" Nitish on the dais, general secretary of the All India Bank Employees'' Association Taraleshwar Chakravarty said: ""We are meeting under the shadow of government''s policies witnessed in subdued protest against the Iraq war, existence of a disinvestment minister in the Union council of ministers, VRS, employment under contract labour system, privatisation of everything from banks to railways. The country witnesses increasing price of kerosene oil while the rate of scotch whisky is coming down sharply.""

However, Nitish made it clear that no future government at the Centre will discontinue such current policies. ""Why do you blame the NDA alone? These policies have been continuing since the days of Narasimha Rao government,"" he maintained.

He said disinvestment has become almost a common practice all over the world, adding, ""Ye to jor-shor se chalega."" But he admitted that one would have to pay the price for these policies in the people''s court.

He appealed to the Central Bank officers and other employees to help improve the credit-deposit ratio in Bihar. ""Hey adhikari mahaprabhu, you just give your recommendation and grant loans to our farmers for the welfare of Bihar,"" he said while reminding them of the Central Bank''s role as lead bank in a number of districts of the state. He invited the banking organisations to invest their money in the development projects undertaken by the railways.

The chairman of the reception committee, commercial taxes minister Abdul Bari Siddiqui, said the bankers of Bihar must promote investment in the state. He urged them to open more bank branches in the state.

Others who spoke on the occasion included Rajya Sabha member Chittaranjan and state secretary of the CPI Jalaluddin Ansari.

13,Babloo aide’s arrest may cause political upheaval,"LUCKNOW: As the investigating agencies turn the heat on elusive Babloo gang member Jitendra Singh, the temperature in political circles has also begun to rise. If arrested, Jitendra Singhâ€™s interrogation might give chief minister Mayawati a leverage and embarrass a prominent political party.

Faced with such a scenario, a stalwart of this party is alleged to have used his clout to see Jitendra away from the long arms of the law.

A close aide of Babloo Srivastava, Jitendra Singh was instrumental in forcing a Delhi based businessman to stay in touch with the don who was in jail.

When Babloo was lodged in Lucknow district jail about a month and a half ago, this businessman was virtually held captive as he arrived at Amausi airport for a visit to the state capital. Jitendra along with four others intercepted his car and escorted him to the gates of the Lucknow district jail. Here the businessman was shocked to see Babloo strolling outside the first entrance of the jail with not even a single security guard in sight. The businessman was then taken inside the jail where he was made to make a few commitments regarding his business deals and contracts with the government.

Later, he lodged a case with the special cell of the Delhi police where he mentioned the incident in detail.

Having close proximity with Babloo, Jitendra had strong links between the don and the political stalwarts. Prior to Bablooâ€™s arrest in Singapore, Jitendra introduced him to a political heavyweight of UP, still a powerful figure in state politics.

This politician even took Babloo and Jitendra to Delhi where the don was introduced to the party cadres as the partyâ€™s â€œbefitting replyâ€� to the criminal-turned-politicians who had joined hands with different political parties in UP.

Brother of a former Member of Parliament, Jitendra is believed to have been closely associated with this high-profile politicianâ€™s family. Jitendra used to frequent his house as he was friendly with his daughter..

On the run, Jitendra could be a prized catch, both for the investigating agencies and Mayawati.

The police are on the trail of Jitendra Singh, but as slippery as an eel, this Babloo aide has so far managed to stay beyond the reach of the investigating agencies. If sources are to be believed, the arrest of Jitendra would remain a â€œmission impossibleâ€� for the police.

14,Corporate lessons for school principals,"KOLKATA: In this era of globalisation school principals need to run their schools like corporate bodies if they want to make successful managers, doctors, lawyers and scientists out of their wards.

To help them keep pace with the changing times, Newspapers in Education (NIE) of The Times of India organised a workshop titled 360 degrees performance management in schools, in collaboration with Career Launchers, at the Hyatt Regency on Saturday. Workshops have been held in nine cities, said Narendra Puppala, president, integrated education, Career Launchers.

â€œThese workshops provide an opportunity for the principals to re-orient themselves to run their schools like successful managers. We ask them to think like chief education officers, who have to be forward looking,â€� he said.

Rashi Narula of Mahadevi Birla school intends to consolidate the feedback system at her school. â€œOne needs to constantly try out new things,â€� added Narula. Principals from 40 schools, who participated in the workshop, were convinced of the need to constantly evolve new systems to help young achievers prepare themselves to face the challenges of globalisation.

15,Warhorses rule the roost in Parliament,"NEW DELHI: Politics has now become the last refuge of the gerontocracy. Or so it seems. Statistics indicate the present Lok Sabha has 73 MPs between 66-85 years of age.

And their numbers are rising. Contrast this with the first Lok Sabha where the average age of MPs was 45. Today, thereâ€™s a discernible drop in the number of MPs between 25-35 years.

Congress warhorse, K Karunakaran is 85 and still going strong. His Lok Sabha colleague, Congress MP, Atma Ram Maganbhai Patel, from Mehsana in Gujarat, is also 85. And he gives colleagues half his age a run for their money at the hustings.

The BJP too has its share of old, but not infirm, men. BJP veteran Nanaji Deshmukh, Rajya Sabha MP, is 86. Lt Col (retd) Maharja Narendra Shah, BJP Lok Sabha MP from Tehri Garhwal, will turn 82 next month. Among women parliamentarians, Krishna Bose, Trinamul Congress, takes the honours. She is the oldest at 73. In fact, the majority of high- profile MPs now are all over 70 years. Leading the pack is PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee at 79. Sprightly L K Advani and Jagmohan follow at 75. And by George, Fernandes is 72.

So why this trend? CPM veteran Somnath Chatterjee says, â€˜â€˜This is disconcerting. Young people today are critical of politicians, but my party keeps telling them that itâ€™s not enough to be an armchair critic. If they want to change the system, they must join politics.â€™â€™

Akali Dal leader Simranjit Singh Mann is also worried. â€˜â€˜Sometimes when I look at the greyheads in Parliament, I feel we have become part of the Rip Van Winkle syndrome. The world has altered dramatically and yet, here we have leaders who continue to spout the old Fabian socialistic jargon.â€™â€™

For deputy chairman of the Rajya Sabha, Najma Heptullah, a House of white-haired, sleeping MPs is cause for concern. â€˜â€˜It is obvious they are no longer concerned with what is happening inside the House. All the lobbying and deals are taking place outside the House.â€™â€™

Congressâ€™ Mani Shanker Aiyar says, â€˜â€˜Top leaders prefer to hand out tickets to those of their peer group. â€™â€™

Modern medicine, too, has kept the old fighting fit. â€˜â€˜Look at Vajpayee. He has already made it clear heâ€™s willing to lead his party into the next elections. I was recently introduced by Arjun Singh as a promising young man in the Congress when I am 62.â€™â€™

Congress MP Renuka Choudhary says she entered the Rajya Sabha at 29 years. â€˜â€˜Priya Ranjan Das Munshi was also lucky â€” he entered at 27 years. The only people who can retire us is the public. But since they have faith in us, we keep coming back.â€™â€™ Some olden era, this.

16,RBI may cut bank rate by 0.25-0.50 pc in credit policy,"MUMBAI: Reserve Bank of India is likely to cut the bank rate by 0.25-0.50 per cent and reduce the cash reserve ratio (CRR) further in its credit and monetary policy for 2003-04, to be announced on April 29, to help enhance liquidity and manage government''s borrowing programme.

The bank rate, which is already at a three decade low of 6.25 per cent, is likely to be revised downwards to give a fillip to nascent industrial recovery in the economy while CRR may see a cut as part of the apex bank''s plan to bring it down to three per cent over the medium term period, banking sources said here on Sunday.

""A one per cent CRR cut from the current 4.75 per cent would free up more funds for lending to industry as also the government''s borrowing target of Rs 1,66,000 crore for the year ending March 2004,"" they added.

On growth in India''s gross domestic product for FY-04, analysts pointed out that RBI Governor Bimal Jalan had last week expressed confidence that the economy would grow by 6.0 per cent compared to the 4.4 per cent estimated for 2002-03.

""The GDP growth of six per cent is based on the Indian Meteorological Department''s forecast of 96 per cent rainfall in the coming monsoon,"" Jalan had said.

The agriculture is also expected to rebound with 4-4.5 per cent growth with better monsoons, he had said.

On inflation, Jalan had said inflation would be around 6-6.1 per cent during the first quarter of FY-04. But the apex bank expects it to soften in the second quarter starting from July and expects inflation to end this fiscal at about 5-5.5 per cent.

Bond market analysts said the policy may also lay a roadmap to initiate the second phase of negotiated dealing system (NDS).

The second phase would enable on-screen auctions of government securities (g-secs). However, this was contingent to the passing of the Government Securities Act, which has been presented in the Parliament, they said.

On the home loans front, bankers said given the fierce competition amongst banks in interest rates, RBI may like to bring some discipline by issuing ""broad"" guidelines.

RBI had recently conveyed a meeting of bankers as it was concerned with the practice of some banks extending housing loans at rates which were below the cost.

The apex bank may also allow trading in bonds used as collateral in repo deals and rolling over of repo contracts, moves that will give investors greater flexibility in managing their portfolios, bond market analysts said.

These measures are expected to deepen the market for repos and help boost volumes in the repo segment and make it an effective tool to manage risks.

At present, RBI does not allow bonds used as collateral in a one-day repo transaction to be traded on the same day and the next, thus preventing investors from benefiting from price rise for two days.

18,Bengal govt making mockery of poll process: Naidu,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The Centre would intervene in West Bengal if the state administration and CPI-M go on ""terrorising political opponents and trample upon democracy"", BJP President M Venkaiah Naidu said on Sunday.

""If they go beyond a point, the Centre will be compelled to intervene in the matter as part of the responsibility under the Constitution and federal system,"" Naidu told reporters on his arrival at the airport here.

Naidu charged the CPI-M in West Bengal with using money, muscle and mafia power from preventing Opposition candidates filing nominations for the forthcoming panchayat polls.

""The election process has been made a mockery. Democracy has been trampled and in more than 18,000 places, CPI-M supporters have prevented Opposition candidates from filing nominations,"" he alleged.

Naidu said recent statement of West Bengal Chief Minister Buddhadev Bhattacharya asking CPI-M cadres to allow the Opposition candidates to file nomination was an ""open admission"" that CPI-M cadres were obstructing political opponents from participating in polls.

""We are only interested to see that all parties receive fare opportunity to contest the election. But, here is a situation in West Bengal where CPI-M party workers terrorise people and kidnap Opposition candidates,"" Naidu alleged.

19,Cong-ruled states adopting anti-farmer policies: Shivankar,"KOCHI: The president of the BJP''s Kisan Morcha, Mahadeva Rao Shivankar, on Sunday alleged that the Congress ruled states in the country were adopting anti-farmer policies.

Addressing a press conference here, Shivankar said over 150 farmers in Kerala had committed suicide, after failing to repay debts. The state government had not extended any concessions to help them out.

He said the Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Punjab governments were also adopting ''anti-farmer'' policies and totally neglecting the farmers.

Over 100 farmers in the cotton growing areas in Maharashtra had also committed suicide, he charged.

He praised the Union government for allotting Rs 500 crore to stabilise the prices of spices, rubber, coffee and tea and said the move had benefitted farmers.

Shivankar charged congress ruled states with not cooperating on the implementation of VAT and suggested that Centre convene a meeting of the states and arrive at a consensus.

20,HP govt has big tourism plans,"SHIMLA: The heights of mighty Rohtang and Kunzum Passes, snow clad peaks of Dhauladhar ranges and outer Himalayas, the grandeur and beauty of Dalhousie and Shimla, the tranquillity and peace of temples and monasteries, the virgin unexplored terrains of Sangla and Spiti valleys and the adventure of trekking and para-gliding. Yes, Himachal offers a complete holiday for everyone.

If the bells at famous Chintpurni, Brijeshwari, Chamunda, Jwalaji, Naina Devi, Hidamba, Laxmi Narain, Bhimakali and Baijnath temples bring peace to Hindus, the ancient Tabo and Key monasteries are where Buddhists from all over the world come to spin their prayer wheels. And for every Sikh, a visit to Himachal is incomplete without paying obeisance at Paonta Sahib gurdwara.

It is not without reason that this tiny hill state, blessed with grandeur and beauty that nature can possibly bestow, has become one of the hottest tourist destinations in the country for both Indian and foreign tourists. During last year, around 49 lakh Indian and 1.44 lakh foreign tourists arrived here to savour the different tastes this state has to offer.

Over the years, tourism has emerged as the most vital sector of the global economy, and the state government has decided to promote it in a big way. The government knows that promoting tourism would help achieve the twin objective of generating income for the state as well as creating employment opportunities for the local people.

To promote heritage tourism, the state government has planned to arrange a week-long celebration to mark the completion of 100 years of the Kalka-Shimla railway line sometime in November next. A highlight of this celebration would be to revive the aura of the British times in this erstwhile capital of the British Raj.

The tourism department is also making efforts to organise a fullfledged Paragliding World Cup during 2004, which will see the best names in the adventure sport participate at Billing in Kangra district.

It is also concentrating on developing heli-skiing in the state apart from training local youth in the finer arts of river rafting, so that there can be diversification in adventure sports from normal trekking and mountain climbing.

The geographical diversity of the state has tremendous potential for development of eco-tourism and the state government intends formulating a policy to promote it in a big way.

It has also decided to involve the private sector in a big way in the tourism sector, with the HPTDC playing the role of a facilitator. The tourism department has also identified 14 places for setting up aerial ropeways and airports at Shimla, Kullu, Mandi and Kangra.

21,Diversification track already bumpy for farmers,"CHANDIGARH: With the ongoing crop diversification drive in Punjab catching steam, inevitable problems have also started surfacing, which the state government has to tackle head on if the drive is to succeed.

Most of these pertain to those farmers who have already taken the road to diversification and who are now facing problems in adopting the right kind of agronomic practices or are unable to produce the desired quality of crop and consequently unable to sell it. In all, the problem is in the domain of extension services that are badly needed and have been moribund ever since the success of the green revolution.

Problems of this kind are being reported from all over Punjab. A farmer allegedly committed suicide recently after he had a problem selling his pea crop to PAGEREXPO, a subsidiary of Punjab Agro Industries Corporation (PAIC).

The problem came up after the severe cold resulted in a below average quality crop. The farmer wanted to sell his entire output to the company but the officials wanted to grade the crop according to fixed parameters. This is said to have depressed the farmer.

Another case in point is that of cauliflower and mustard cultivation, in which the farmers have badly burnt their fingers. In both cases, contract farming was initiated at the behest of PAIC and did not succeed or measure up to the expectations of farmers.

In case of mustard, a private company that had entered the arena with an understanding with PAIC, was to supply seed to farmers and this was to cost nearly Rs 500 per acre for the seed. The problem arose when the seed could not be made available to farmers at the right time and the farmers suffered.

In this case the yield was almost onethird of what was expected by the farmers and the result was a massive loss. The same problem confronted the farmers in case of cauliflower, too, where the yields were reported to be much lower than expected.

All this cannot but deal a blow to the confidence of the farmer in the ""new agriculture"" the state government hopes to promote.

At the face of it the problem seems two-fold: A problem of coordination between government agencies involved in the process, the farmers and the private companies involved in contract farming. The problem is likely to grow in the times to come when the acreage under diversified crops increases.

This year itself nearly two lakh acres are expected to be diversified into basmati rice, maize, vegetable and other crops. At the moment, it is PAIC alone that is looking after the diversification project.

If even with two lakh acres, which is a small area compared to the total cultivated area in the state, such coordination problems are emerging, it is anybodyâ€™s guess as to what will happen when the area under diversified crops and a contract farming regime goes up to say 25 to 30 per cent of the total cropped area.

22,Economic development on govt's agenda: Mufti,"JALANDHAR: Emphasising that healing touch policy was meant to win over the hearts of people of militancy-hit state, Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed on Sunday said that two-pronged strategy fight against militancy with full might and economic development through boosting tourism was being pursued to accelerate the normalisation process in the state.

""The situation in the state is fast approaching towards normalisation,which can be evident from the fact that in spite of All Party Hurriyat Conference (APHC) boycott call and militants'' threat, about 40,000 locals overwhelmingly attended the rally addressed by Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee in Srinagar,"" said Sayeed at a function organised here by Hind Samachar Group of newspapers to distribute Shaheed Parivar fund.

Justifying the state government''s decision of not implementing anti- terrorism law Pota, he said that the state government was committed to fight militancy with full might and ""there is no need to implement Pota as the existing laws like Public Safety Act (PSA) too had enough provisions to sternly deal with anti-national elements"".

""We have not stopped security forces to launch operation against militants, but the clear instructions were given that there should not be any violation of human rights,"" Sayeed said, adding that the state government and administration would function in a transparent way.

On Hurriyat''s decision of not talking to the Union government''s chief negotiator, NN Vohra, without naming APHC, Sayeed said it was already known that the party which did not want restoration of peace in the state would definitely reject the talks. He said that the state government was preparing a comprehensive policy to promote tourism and hotel industry in the valley since economic development was the only tested way to attract youth to join the normalisation process in the present context.

""Besides, we will soon launch a media campaign to show the true picture of Kashmir to attract domestic and foreign tourists since the state is fast turning towards peace even as isolated incidents of militancy can''t be projected as a major threat to peace,"" he added.

""Promoting tourism in the valley is the only way to extend one-to-one contact with people of other states, who are still believing that Kashmiris are living under the shadow of guns, which is no more the case,"" he said. Sayeed invited business community of the country, particularly from the neighbouring states, including Punjab to organise business conferences and events in Kashmir to help substantiate the economic development process in the state.

Former Punjab police chief KPS Gill in his address, said that strong political was must to curb any form of militancy and it was commendable to note that major political parties of the country had arrived on consensus to sternly deal with terror in the valley. On the stepping up of violence in the state recently, Gill termed it as their frustration.

""Militant groups supported by Pakistan have failed to halt the peace process in the state because the locals were not supporting them, which is why they are now feeling desperate and frustrated,"" he said.

In his address, J&K deputy chief minister Mangat Ram Sharma alleged that some opposition party leaders were misinterpreting the ""healing touch policy"" of the PDP-led government. ""Healing touch policy is the best way to win confidence of the people and even the Prime Minister in his speech at a recent rally has praised the policy,"" he added.

Prominent among others who spoke on the occasion included Panthers Party chief Bhim Singh, Punjab Congress president HS Hanspal, noted journalist Balraj Puri and chief editor of the Hind Samachar Group of newspapers Vijay Kumar Chopra.

23,Arid land turns into goldmine for farmers,"BASSA KALHANU, Pathankot: Nobody in this village could have imagined three years ago that the parched cultivable tract here, which is at the mercy of rain gods, would someday yield high-value crops.

Today, not only does each farmer have enough water to irrigate his fields for high-value crops like fenugreek and coriander, there is an abundant yearround supply of green fodder for the cattle too.

The economy of the land has undergone a transformation, the credit for which goes to the Integrated Watershed Development Project (IWDP, Hills-11) authorities, who during one of their tours observed that there was a perennial flow of seepage water in Sangar Khad, which could be tapped for irrigation.

So, to utilise the vast potential of this natural resource, which had so far gone unnoticed probably because the surface water flow is not apparent except during the monsoon season, IWDP officials planned a wall and two pipelines for harvesting the water through gravity.

IWDP project (unit II) team leader N S Randhawa said the Makkowal-type water harvesting structure was raised in Bassa with the help of water-users group, a self-help group of the village development committee (VDC), at a nominal cost of Rs 4.92 lakh.

Today, the structure is running excellently and a tariff has been fixed for its use.

Realising that the landless and poor also have an equal right over natural resources, the water-users group has decided to contribute 20 per cent of the water tariff collections towards them, said Randhawa, giving all the credit for the success of the project to the water-users group, saying the IWDP was a mere facilitator.

Encouraged by the positive results, the VDC is now strongly advocating extension of the pipeline, for which people of other villages are willing to contribute.

Some inspired villagers have also taken to vermi-compost, which would give a boost to organic farming in the area in the years to come, said Randhawa.
