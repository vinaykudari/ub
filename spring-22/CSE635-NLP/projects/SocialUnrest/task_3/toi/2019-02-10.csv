0,Cop remained silent spectator to violence,"pune: the shocking inaction of a police constable in whose presence a young ph d student was slapped by her neighbour and subsequently forced to vacate her residence at sinhagad road, has given a wider dimension to what was otherwise an ordinary quarrel between neighbours. although the police finally filed a non-cognisable offence against rajendra shinde for slapping and threatening his neighbour varsha shriram on december 13, they have not taken any action against constable mahesh gaikwad in whose presence the incidents occurred. asked to comment on the incident, officers at the haveli police station refused. the shindes told times news network that they were not at fault. in fact, vaishali shinde, wife of rajendra, said that on december 13 it is she who she was assaulted by varsha shriram and her sister veena and that she has even lodged a police complaint to this effect. she said that her husband then slapped varsha because ""he was provoked by the rude behaviour of these two girls who assaulted me and later abused my husband"". the shriram family has turned its ire on the police. they believe the policeman on duty could have prevented the abuse but simply chose not to. d r shriram is an assistant registrar of the maharashtra health science university, nashik. he has submitted a memorandum to deputy chief minister chhagan bhujbal stating that the police are refusing to provide protection to his family. consequently the family has moved from their residence in sinhagad road to the sassoon hospital quarters allotted to veena who is a lecturer at the bj medical college. the two well-educated neighbours have had a history of disagreements over matters such as playing loud music etc. in his memorandum to bhujbal, shriram said that on the day in question, vaishali shinde abused his wife and daughter veena over some petty matter. when rajendra shinde returned home from work, he called the police to his house and in the presence of constable mahesh gaikwad from abhiruchi outpost of the haveli police station, slapped varsha, misbehaved with her and threatened her. shriram in his memorandum further said that the police refused to allow varsha to lodge a complaint and also pressurised her not to mention that she was slapped in the presence of the police constable. when shriram heard what had happened, he rushed home from nashik on december 14 and complained of the incident to inspector raosaheb sardesai of the haveli police station. according to him, the inspector refused to mention the name of the constable in the complaint that was registered with the police. ""we were given a copy of our complaint on january 17 and what was serious was that the copy did not bear any outward number, seal or signature of any officer,"" shriram said. the outraged deputy registrar then took the matter to the district superintendent of police dr madhav sanap, at whose instance the haveli police, on december 19, registered a proper non-cognisable offence against rajendra shinde. however no mention was made of the presence of an officer of the law when the alleged abuse was going on. inspector raosaheb sardesai of the haveli police station told tnn that taking note of the girl being slapped by her neighbour, the police have registered a non-cognisable offence. he however refused to comment on the failure of the police to take action against the constable. the shrirams are far from satisfied with the action taken by the police and are determined to pursue the matter till they are ensured of complete justice in the case.

6,Memories of caste clashes haunt voters,"hastinapur (meerut): the bitter memories of two bloody caste clashes in january 1996 in nearby ikwara and pali villages in which 13 persons were brutally done to death continue to haunt the voters in this rural reserved assembly segment. attempts by campaigners of different party candidates, specially bahujan samaj party (bsp), to divide the voters on caste line by arousing passions are already on. several banners and posters on both sides of the meerut-kotdwar road leading to this erstwhile capital of kaurava and pandavas days indicate the party campaignersâ€™ attempts to refresh those bitter memories. â€˜â€˜have you forgotten the ikwara-pali killings?â€™â€™ these posters remind you. while the party campaigners who may be benefited by the division of dalit-gujjar votes stoutly deny any such attempts by them, the authorities concerned say these campaigners are definitely trying to foment the trouble in these villages. â€˜â€˜we have repeatedly warned the parties against any attempt to create law and order situation by arousing caste feelings,â€™â€™ said district magistrate (meerut) avneesh awasthi. â€˜â€˜and for that we are not only holdings meetings with these people but also keeping close vigil on them,â€™â€™ he added. a visit to mawana, hastinapur and its nearby villages showed that some local issues may also influence the poll. voters in this constituency seem to be angry with the local bjp sitting mla atul kumar and the mp avtar singh bhadana for their failure to get the mawana and hastinapur towns linked with the rail line. bus is the only mode of public transport to reach these towns. while the main meerut-kotdwar road which passes through the mawana town is full of potholes, mawana town even lack basic civic amenities. it does not even have a proper bus stand. the resentment against atul kumar for his failure to do anything for the constituency after he was elected as bjp mla from here in 1996 poll had forced bjp state unit to deny him the ticket this time. the bjp has fielded a woman candidate geeta prakash from here. an â€˜â€˜outsider,â€™â€™ geeta is being seen as a weak candidate.

8,Hurriyat inching towards Assembly polls,"new delhi: athough divided on the issue, the 23-party hurriyat conference is inching towards participation in the forthcoming assembly elections in jammu and kashmir later this year and was working on modalities for the same though none of the senior leaders of the amalgam was willing to come on record. two hurriyat conference leaders -- abdul gani lone and mirwaiz umer farooq -- have been camping in the capital for over a week and were meeting not only the non-government intermediaries but also high level government officials to discuss a way out for contesting the polls. though the two leaders have been maintaining that they were in the capital for ""personal reasons"", both of them have been seen running from pillar to post meeting the government officials and non-government intermediaries during the stay here. the hurriyat conference team has also been meeting some media barons to garner support and ensure a positive coverage. the hurriyat conference''s first poll balloon of forming their own election commission has failed to rouse any keen interest in international community, which have been pressurising the amalgam leadership to contest the polls and prove their popularity, informed sources said here. the election commission, proposed by hurriyat''s senior leader and jklf chief yaseen malik has been seen as a ploy by expatriate kashmiris in the united states and britain to embarass india. immediately after the announcement, new delhi rejected the proposal of forming the election commission and asked the leaders to join the poll arena and assured them of free and fair polls. the challenge thrown by the state chief minister farooq abdullah has created an uneasy calm within the conglomerate as barring lone, umer farooq and fire-brand jamaat-e-islami leader syed ali shah geelani, no other hurriyat leader is regarded as having a constituency to support him in any electoral battle. the hurriyat conference has also been toying with the idea of working out an accord along the lines of ""good friday agreement"" reached between ireland and britain. under the agreement, britain recognises the legitimacy of whatever choice is freely exercised by a majority of the people of northern ireland. however, the hurriyat camp does not seem to be over enthused over this move because it is nowhere bringing them closer to facing the ballot and coming to power.

12,"Air hostesses getting increasingly fat, says A-I study","bangalore: pretty women with perfect smiles. pearly white teeth, sweet voice. oozing hospitality. in the form of the lady who welcomes you on board an aircraft - the air hostess. but reality bites. air-india in a recent study found some shocking facts. health check-ups on 310 of its women cabin-crew members revealed that nearly 42 per cent were overweight, thanks to their lifestyle. lack of choice of food, an airborne routine that does not allow them to exercise and irregular sleeping habits have pushed the maharaja''s beauties much behind the standard bar. dr rekha rahate, assistant chief medical officer of air-india''s medical services department told the times of india that biochemical tests are also conducted for those who are overweight by more than 25 per cent of body-mass index, to rule out diabetes and thyroid problems. ""within the next six months, a-i will introduce a medical examination system for its 6,000 male and female cabin crew,"" says dr b.b. gajre, general manager-medical services, a-i. it may be recalled that the bombay high court, in its order in august 2001, had extended the flying age for air hostesses up to 58 years, on par with men. the court also suggested periodic medical tests to find out their fitness levels so as to maintain a physique presentable to passengers and help detect disease early. as part of fat-fighting measures, a-i is also providing counselling to air hostesses and developing exercise and diet regimes. the data dishes out more stunning details. nearly 8 per cent are hypertense and on medication, while 31 per cent have an obstetric history. ``many of the women marry late because they are career-minded and have late pregnancies,'''' explains rahate. after she touches 40, an air hostess also has to undergo mammography and pap smears to scan for related diseases. if there is the presence of a fibroid, the airline offers treatment and then she resumes work. ``is her ability to function in an emergency obstructed by her health condition? this is the question that decides if she stays,'''' says dr gajre. the idea of such tests is also to prevent loss of manpower because training such personnel could run into lakhs, says wg cdr (dr) j.k. shrivastava, deputy chief medical officer of the department. so while the maharaja lines up a series of tests for the hostesses, passengers can `weight and watch''!

14,Rights body for more teeth to new terror law,"patna: the national human rights commission (nhrc) and other human rights organisations of the country may not be approving the prevention of terrorism (second) ordinance (poto-second), but an organisation, the human rights association, which is active in bihar, is an exception and has demanded more stringent law to tackle terrorism. its members assembled at the gandhi sangrahalya here on sunday. they approved the poto-second. they even demanded a more â€œdeterrentâ€� law to contain terrorism.presenting his paper on poto, lawyer umashankar prasad said, â€œmuch has been talked about the human rights of criminals, terrorists, gangsters and guerrillas. â€œlet us now talk about the protection of interests of innocent people.â€� prasad said poto (second) was softer than its earlier incarnations like chandigarh disturbed areas act, army forces (punjab and chandigarh) special power act, terrorist and disruptive activities act, 1985, and terrorist affected areas (special courts) act 1985. these laws were more deterrent in comparison to poto (second), said prasad. he said that the amended poto had allowed confessional statement to be made before a police officer in the rank of sp, but it was not right. prasad said the prevailing reform theory regarding punishment had increased the number of crimes tremendously. â€œnow, the emphasis must be on the deterrent theory of punishment. the element of deterrence in criminal law has to be increased, heightened and enhanced,â€� he insisted. â€œif 90 per cent criminals are let off by courts, it is not because those persons were innocent or were wrongly booked and put to trial,â€� said prasad.
