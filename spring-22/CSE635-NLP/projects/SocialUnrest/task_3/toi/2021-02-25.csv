3,Former minister joins RJD,"PATNA: Former Union minister and president of Samajwadi Janata Dal (Democratic), a breakaway faction of JD-U, Devendra Prasad Yadav, merged his party with the Rashtriya Janata Dal here on Wednesday.

Announcing his decision at the partyâ€™s Sankalp rally, Yadav said, â€œLaloo se matbhed ho sakta hai, manbhed nahi (there may be difference of opinion with Laloo, but there canâ€™t be any dispute with him). Two senior leaders of the SJD (Democratic), former state minister Mundrika Singh Yadav (Jehanabad) and former MLA Radhakant Yadav (from Madhepura) also declared their decision to join RJD along with Devendra Yadav.

Incidentally, the three leaders were in the Janata Dal in mid-1990s. After the split of JD, Devendra Yadav joined Sharad Yadav-led JD-U. Again, after the merger of Samata Party and JD-U a couple of months back, Devendra Yadav formed Samajwadi Janata Dal (Democratic), before making another somersault to join RJD. He represents Jhanjharpur parliamentary constituency in Lok Sabha.

Devendra Yadav said that the growing influence of fascist forces in the NDA forced him to join hands with the RJD, which, he claimed, is a force to reckon with against NDA. His move is also aimed at preventing split of â€œsecular votesâ€� during the forthcoming parliamentary election. He concluded, â€œJab Laloo se dil mila hai tab dal bhi mil gaya.â€�

RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav, who was present on the occasion, reciprocated by saying that Devendra Yadav had taken the right decision at the right moment and added, â€œNadi kayi jagah se nikalkar ek hi jagah milti hai.â€� He appealed to people to gird up their loins to rout NDA in the coming poll so that communal forces could not raise their heads.

Laloo debunked the development plank being pursued by NDA and asked what vikas the country had witnessed where crores of people were unemployed and over 12 crore were living below the poverty line.

4,Bombs hurled in heart of city as parties clash,"KOLKATA: Political tension spilled on to the streets of Kolkata, on Wednesday, when CPM and Trinamul Congress activists lobbed bombs and ransacked party offices.

Two men were injured and traffic on the bustling Narkeldanga Main Road came to a halt for three hours.

The north Kolkata locality saw simmering strife since Tuesday night. On the bandh day, Trinamul supporters had allegedly removed a CPM flag and flung bricks at the party office on Narkeldanga Main Road. CPM supporters claimed that their rivals were irked at the ""successful bandh.""

Since Wednesday morning, CPM cadres worked themselves up and took to shouting slogans. They first trooped to the Phoolbagan police station and then squatted on the Narkeldanga road for an hour.

The CPM cadres claimed that when they were protesting near the Trinamul office, bombs were hurled at them, which led to a lot of panic.

As most of the men ran for cover, Shankar Das and Suranjan Banerjee were hit by splinters. ""They were treated and discharged from RG Kar Hospital. The complainants submitted a medical certificate to us,"" said Harmanpreet Singh DC (Headquarters).

Furious at the attack, CPM cadres went on the rampage, pelting stones at the Trinamul office. Some of them even ransacked their leader Dilip Singh''s home.

The Trinamul, however, did not lodge any complaint till late this evening. A large police team was rushed to the spot and a Rapid Action Force was kept on standby. Morning traffic was crippled for over three hours.

6,MCI move mars PMCH party,"PATNA: The college foundation day celebrations and Patna Medical College and Hospital alumni reunion on Wednesday were marred to some extent by the recommendations made by the Medical Council of India (MCI) to derecognise five medical colleges in Bihar.

7,Shourie reads riot act to bankers on govt offerings,"NEW DELHI: The accusation is they did so to depress the market and help some financial institutions to mop up stocks in the hope that the final sale price would be based on the scrips'' previous closing price.

Sources said the financial advisors also suggested postponing or splitting the offerings into domestic and overseas floats. Theoretically, this is possible only for oil explorer ONGC, likely to be the biggest by price and most attractive by value.

But the government isn''t taking any of the suggestions as it is running out of time to raise at least Rs 13,000 crore to bridge its selloff proceeds deficit before the fiscal closes on March 31.

Any change now would mean going back to the Cabinet Committee on Disinvestment, which again will be mired in technicalities now that the government is a caretaker one.

So, the six issues remain on schedule, Shourie told reporters at a function in the evening and added that they will mop up the target set by the finance minister.

8,TV channels cash in on political advertisements,"HYDERABAD: Leaders in the state are riding piggyback on popular soaps news-based TV programmes to flaunt their ideologies and take their â€œvote-meâ€� messages into the living rooms.

With the count of couch potatoes going up by the day, the box is now the ideal vehicle to spread the word around. As for the new channels, itâ€™s never been this good. They are raking in the moolah from jingles of all hues.

The private players have an advantage over Doordarshan for they donâ€™t have to take permissions and clearances from anyone to air political advertisements, nor is there any fixed tariff for these commercials. Charge as you like, seems to be the maxim.

Gemini TV, for instance, asks for Rs 17,000 per 10-second spot. But on Teja, you pay Rs 10,000 for the same slot. On ETV II, the going rate is Rs 10,000 for a prime-time slot and Rs 4,000 for non-peak hour telecast.

The rates are the same as general commercials, but officials of these companies insist that political parties invariably ask for concessions.

â€œThey donâ€™t pay the going rate, and are constantly looking for discounts,â€� a senior private TV channel official says.

At TV9, the charges are anywhere between Rs 3,000 and Rs 15,000 for 10-second spots. But if the customer is a political party, the tariffs can be flexible. Both ETV II and TV9 are heavy on political content.

Other than news-based programmes, they also air panel discussions and news features.

Almost all media planners in political parties pitch for prime-time telecast slots.

This is when serials are on air and families sit round the box. There are those who also gun for the afternoon spots as well. This is when the housewife often gets to spend time with the television.

However, advertising on a terrestrial channel such as Siti Cable is a much cheaper option. Here, one can buy a 10-second spot for as little as Rs 1,000. If the time span is slightly larger â€” say 30 seconds â€” the rates can come down to as low as Rs 200 for 10 seconds. And the commercial goes on air five to six times a day.

Doordarshan seems to be missing out on all this. For there are far too many permissions to be sought before DD gets to telecast a political advertisement.

First the chief election commissioner has to give permission to telecast the advertisement, then the script must be okayed by a panel. â€œThey (the political parties) can only talk of the good they have done or what they have achieved.We cannot allow a slanging match,where a party criticises another,â€� Doordarshan Kendra Hyderabad assistant station director D T K Chakravarthy says.

Similar is the case with the All-India Radio (AIR). Though they have aired commercials of political parties in previous elections, they still need a clearance to do so from AIR Delhi.

â€œAs soon as the poll dates are firmed up, we will get a signal from the headquarters on whether or not to air political ads,â€� says Shailaja Suman of AIR, Hyderabad. In the meantime, the demand for commercial spots is increasing in all channels â€” including the twohour FM channel broadcast on AIR, Japa4.

Says MD of Japa4, Arun Kumar, â€œThere is a lot of demand from political parties to air their ads and we realise itâ€™s good business. But since our programming is on AIR, we need to get a clearance. Once we get that, thereâ€™s plenty of business from these commercials.â€�

9,Bhopal rally turns dirty: Bachelor vs spinster,"BHOPAL: With Lok Sabha election around the corner, the Congress at a poorly attended rally here, on Wednesday, again raked up Prime Minister Vajpayee''s ''bachelor'' status along with Uma Bharti''s ''spinster sanyasin'' image.

12,EC: Chakma issue may hurt polls,"NEW DELHI: The Election Commission may not be able to hold elections in parts of Arunachal Pradesh till Chakma issue is resolved.

In a letter to the Prime Minister''s Office early this month, the EC had warned that the Chakma issue could ""snowball into a volatile poll issue"" and requested it to solve the problem ""amicably and expeditiously"".

But EC officials say there has been no response from the government so far. ""The ball is in government''s court...We are waiting,"" an EC official said.

Despite a Supreme Court order of 1996 that the Central and the state government should settle the Chakma issue and a Delhi High Court order of 2000 that Chakmas born in India after their settlement in the state but before July 1, 1987, are citizens of India, the Arunachal Pradesh cabinet passed a resolution on May 14, 2003, not permitting their enrolment in the voters'' list.

The EC''s letter to the PMO highlights the fact that even the electoral registration officers of four assembly constituencies â€” Doimukh, Chowkham, Bordumsa-Diyum and Miao where nearly 60,000 Chakmas live â€” ""are not abiding by the direction of the EC to include Chakmas in the electoral rolls"".

On January 2, the EC issued an order that it ""shall not be able to conduct any election in these four assembly constituencies unless the state authorities, including the electoral registration officers, comply with the commission''s direction"".

The Chakmas came from Bangladesh as refugees in 1964 and were settled by the Indian government in Arunachal Pradesh, among other areas.

Citizenship for them has been hanging fire since then. After the Delhi HC order, the EC expressed concern about their enrolment as voters.

13,Hutch plans Rs 300 cr Gujarat investment,"AHMEDABAD: Cellular services provider Hutch has drawn plans to pump in around Rs 300 crore in Gujarat circle for the year 2004 primarily for network capacity enhancement and upgradation of its call centre and billing systems.

â€œAlmost 80 per cent of the investment would go towards increasing network coverage by adding around 300 cellsites to the existing 650-odd cellsites. We also plan to put up a 300 seat call centre at our Ellisbridge headquarters,â€� Sanjoy Mukerji, chief operating officer, Fascel Ltd, told TNN.

Hutch, which ramped up its call centre from 60 seats to 130 seats in 2003, is now planning to increase this to 300 seats by December 2004.

At present, the cellular player covers 200 towns with 650 cellsites and would increase it to 250 towns with 950 cellsites by 2004 end.

Investments would also be made in upgrading billing systems, increasing the number of exclusive one-stop Hutch shops to 50 from 29, most of which would be put up in upcountry locations, and hiking teleshops (sales points) from 217 to 400 by the end of the year, Mukerji added.

â€œWith tariffs being market driven and not under our control, we have decided to focus aspects that are under our control. The thrust thus will be on customer services initiatives, network coverage and value added services to reach out to the customer,â€� he explained.

As part of this, the player intends to put up recharge zones in trains allowing customers to recharge their cellphones while on the move. At present, Hutch has put up 600 recharge zones in public places including Volvo buses plying in Gujarat.

Hutch, which has already invested around Rs. 1135 crores in Gujarat by December 2003, had invested around Rs 250 crore in 2003. It has a total subscriber base of 8.57 lakh users in Gujarat.

15,CM holds meeting with medical education minister,"PATNA: The CM Rabri Devi on Thursday held a high level meeting with the medical education minister Dr Shakeel Ahmad and top officials of the state administration to discuss the situation in the wake of recommendation of executive committee of medical council of India(MCI) for the derecognition of five out of the six medical college of Bihar.

The chief minister directed the medical education minister to remove the teaching and infrastructural deficiencies, if any, in all the six medical colleges of the state at the earliest. She also directed Ahmad to ensure that all the vacant posts of assistant professors in the colleges were filled up soon.

The chief secretary K A H Suramanian, principal secretary to the chief minister Mukund Prasad, medical education secretary S S Verma and Member(revenue), Bihar state electricity board(BSEB) and former medical education secretary Afzal Amanullah were prominent among those attending the meeting. The RJD national president Laloo Prasad Yadav also attended the meeting. The chief minister also directed the medical education department to ascertain whether the MCI executive committee had really recommended derecognition of five Bihar medical colleges.

Ahmad while stating that all the vacant posts of assistant professors would be filled up by March 15, said that the department would soon formulate a policy in this regard. In fact, he said, the department had already initiated step in that direction. Replying to a query, Ahmad said that the state government would not take up the matter with the union health minister Sushma Swaraj till it had received any communication from the MCI regarding the recommendation of its executive for the withdrawal of recognition to Patna Medical College, Darbhanga Medical College, Sri Krishna Medical College, Muzaffarpur, Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College, Bhagalpur and NMCH.

A senior official of the medical education department said that about 280 posts of assistant professors were lying vacant in the six government medical colleges of the state. The government is likely to fill up the vacant posts of assistant professors by promoting the existing Resident Medical Officers (RMOs) and Registrars of different departments of the six medical colleges to this posts.

It is not yet clear whether the government would also consider the RMO and Registrars, who had completed their tenure before the state government issued a notification regarding the framing of Medical Education Service Rules, on May 21, 1997, to create separate cadre of medical education service, for appointment to the post of assistant professors.

Meanwhile, the BJP spokesperson Kiran Ghai on Thursday said that while the NDA government had decided to establish an AIIMS in Patna the foundation stone of which had already been laid, the RJD government had failed to improve the functioning of its own medical colleges forcing the MCI executive committee to recommend the derecognition of five government medical colleges.
