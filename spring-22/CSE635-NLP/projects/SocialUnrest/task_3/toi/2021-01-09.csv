1,Names shortlisted for LS polls: CM,"MYSORE: Chief Minister S M Krishna on Friday said the Congress had shortlisted names of candidates for all the 28 Lok Sabha seats in the state, with the Chief Election Commission and the NDA government at the Centre dropping enough indications of the polls being advanced.

Speaking to reporters at the Mandakalli air strip here, Krishna declined to name the candidates. At present, the Congress holds 17 of the 28 Lok Sabha seats in the state.

Union human resource development minister Murli Manohar Joshi, who was also present to inaugurate the golden jubilee celebrations of the Ramakrishna Vidyashala, said: ""Elections will be held earlier than scheduled. Prime Minister Vajpayee, will, however, decide on the dates.""

The chief minister said his party was prepared to face the Lok Sabha elections, but ruled out early Assembly polls for the time being. ""As on today, I am in favour of completing my five-year term in accordance with the mandate given by the people, but tomorrow my mind and decision may change. Who knows what is hidden in the future?""

Krishna said the Congress was in favour of fighting elections in alliance with the parties opposed to the NDA. ""I welcome the pact reached between the Congress and the DMK,"" he said, adding the NDAâ€™s enemy is the Congressâ€™ friend.

Asked whether the Congress would align with the JD(S) in Karnataka, Krishna ducked the question, saying: ""Whoever is opposed to the NDA is our ally.""

Without naming anybody, Krishna said many leaders and parties had expressed their intention to join the Congress which would go a long way in defeating the BJP and NDA.

A majority of state ministers, at a meeting convened by Krishna on January 6, had favoured simultaneous polls.

Anticipating early elections, the chief minister will present the state budget in mid-February, ahead of the Union Budget.

2,'Indian politics is the same old mess',"MUMBAI: The courtship between India''s most famous Indo-Anglian writer Salman Rushdie, currently in Mumbai with girlfriend and muse Padma Laksmi, was a trans-Atlantic one.

In 1999, when they first met, Rushdie was one of the world''s most high-profile asylum-seekers in London, city which he later spurned for its ""provincial bitchiness"". Recalls Padma Lakshmi fondly, ""We spoke a lot on the phoneâ€”no, we didn''t SMS. I only got on to e-mail after I met him.""

Amazingly, the dewy-eyed couple has escaped the attentions of the local paparazzi during their Christmas swing through Chennai, Rajasthan and Delhi, although in glittersavvy Mumbai, every head turned at a trendy downtown resto on Thursday when they staged a late-night entry.

Asked what the city of his childhood looks like today, Rushdie is uncharacteristically guarded. ""Bombay is Bombay,"" he says somewhat limply. ""Ask me again in a few days, and I''ll tell you.""

He intends to visit his boyhood home and catch up with old friends and writers to get a sense of whether India is really shining. ""I see that slogan everywhere. It''s a bit like the love New York'' campaign. I''ve tried to keep in touch with Indian politics as best as possible, but it''s just the same old mess.""

Top of his list of people to meet is Vikram Chandra, author of Love and Longing in Mumbai. ""I was hoping to meet him because he is someone whose writings on Bombay I have always liked. Envy is a very good test... when you get annoyed that somebody is so good.""

Top of her list is film-maker Apoorva Lakhia (Bombay Se Aaya Mera Dost) who will direct the first movie based on a Rushdie work, Firebird''s Nest, a short story which appeared in The New Yorker.

Padma Lakshmi will stay on in India after Rushdie leaves in a few days to research her role for a forthcoming film in which she plays an Indian immigrant in the US.

""I''ve come home (to Chennai) to watch how my grandmother makes dosas, to listen to Indian classical music, observe the mannerisms of my aunts and cousins, read everything from A.P.J. Kalam''s autobiography to the Bhagwad Gita.""

Rushdie slips in slyly, ""She plays an old-fashioned girl. It will require acting.""

3,"Another day of murder, mute police & civic unrest","PATNA: Blockades at two of the busiest roads of Patna against crime rise hit the normal life in a major part of the city on Friday as criminals thumbed their nose at the police, executing second murder within 24 hours.

A tractor driver was shot dead and two others were injured as criminals opened fire at the Qualis vehicle of a real estate builder, Gaurav Singh alias Chandan, right in front of the Central Public Works Department (CPWD) office in the busy Punaichak area off Bailey Road on Friday afternoon. Irate tractor drivers blocked the road with their vehicles near the new Secretariat to protest the killing of their colleague, identified as Balmiki Yadav, a resident of Nalanda district.

Singh''s private bodyguard Sunil and driver Sujit were admitted to PMCH after they received bullet injuries in the firing. However, Sachivalaya DSP Arshad Zaman claimed it was a shootout during which two groups exchanged fire.

Sujit told TNN at PMCH that motorcycle-borne criminals pumped one bullet in the front tyre and then repeatedly fired at the vehicle just when it was coming out of the CPWD office. Besides him and the bodyguard, a friend of Singh was also inside the vehicle. ""Chandan was in the CPWD office,"" he said, feigning ignorance about the reason behind the incident.

Eye-witnesses said the policemen deployed at the CPWD office chose to look the other way and did not react. On hearing the news, senior police officers, already busy negotiating with the agitators blocking the Boring Road to protest another killing, rushed to the new Secretariat and got the blockade cleared.

The entire Boring Road stretch on Friday observed a complete bandh to protest the murder of trader Santosh Kumar, who had opened a shop, Kusum, only a few months back, on Thursday. The police had to lob a few teargas shells to disperse the protesting mob which had put up blockades at several points on the otherwise busy road. The agitators, mostly traders, attributed the Thursday''s murder to the failure of the trader to pay extortion amount to the criminals. The traders also sat on a dharna and raised anti-police slogans. According to them, all the businessmen of the area are being asked by criminals to regularly pay ""rangdari tax"". City SP Ganesh Kumar, who talked to a few businessmen, told TNN that the killing did not appear to be related with any extortion demand.

The police on Friday recorded the statement of Shyamdeo Mehta, a teacher in Gautam Buddha College, who was injured when the criminals fired at Santosh.

""Dairying in Europe, Australia, New Zealand and North America is dominated by cooperatives. They enjoy the same legal and regulatory environment as any other enterprise.

Though a new multi-state cooperative act had been enacted recently, not many states had adopted it, he regretted.

""I believe that a cooperative -- an enterprise of, by and for users -- is the institution that can work best. So says the Amul experience and that of advanced nations, all of which have strong agricultural cooperatives,"" Kurien said.

Strongly advocating self-reliance in village economies, he said the Union government must stop ''prescribing'' the development programmes for villages and let them work out programmes which they think could work best for them.
