1,CPM man killed in Bankura clash,"KOLKATA: A CPM supporter was killed and another seriously injured when they were attacked by alleged Trinamul Congress workers at Parashar village in Bankuraâ€™s Sonamukhi police station area on Thursday night.

Former Trinamul pradhan from the Dhuliya gram panchayat Kashinath Mondal was arrested for his masterminding the attack. A group of armed men attacked Nishakar Ghosh and Ashok Kumar Sit at around 11.30 pm on Thursday when they were returning home on bicycles.

The attackers used choppers, axes and other sharp weapons to bring down the duo. â€œGhosh died on the spot while a seriously injured Sit was removed to the Bankura Medical College Hospital. Based on his complaint, we have arrested Mondal who is still the pradhan of the Dhuliya gram panchayat.

Two of his associates have also been taken into custody. â€œMaybe, Mondal was not present during the attack but he could have masterminded it,â€� said Narayan Ghosh, DIG (Hq). Though the Dhuliya gram panchayat has been wrested by the CPM from the Trinamul in the last panchayat polls, Mondal continues to remain pradhan till the new board is formed.

3,In-laws arrested after suicide,"HOWRAH: A 25-year-old woman committed suicide on Thursday night by burning herself. After a heated argument with her husband, Luna Ghosh of 48, Kolabagan lane, in Shibpur, poured kerosene and set herself on fire.

She was rushed to the Howrah General Hospital where she succumbed to her injuries late Thursday night. Her husband and in-laws have been arrested by the Shibpur police on Friday after an FIR filed by parents of the deceased. Luna married Ashish Ghosh in 2000 against the wishes of her parents.

Soon after she eloped, her parents disowned Luna. However, the marriage soon landed in troubled waters. Ashish works as a driver. There were regular altercations between the two. Police said she was tortured by her husband and inlaws and was suffering for the past few months.

â€œIt seems the regular torture drove her to the brink of mental frustration. She finally committed suicide,â€� said an officer of the Shibpur PS. The woman however, left no suicide note. Her parents who had disowned her initially, had apparently patched up with their daughter after hearing about her sad plight. They had been visiting her regularly from the end of 2002.

4,CPM to support Congress in LS polls,"KOLKATA: The CPM will support the Congress in the next Lok Sabha polls to stop the BJP from coming to power.

But under no circumstances would the Marxists enter into any front with the Congress, CPM politburo member and West Bengal state secretary Anil Biswas said on Friday. Explaining the CPMâ€™s stand, as decided during the recently held politburo and central committee meetings of the CPM, Biswas said, â€œOur objective is to defeat the BJP.

We will support the Congress in those constituencies where there will be no Left or democratic forces. However, there will be no united front with the Congress.â€� The CPM leader, however, said the party had not yet decided whether to support the Congress in case they needed support of the Left to form government in the Centre. â€œWe have not yet discussed the issue of government formation.

It will be decided during the elections,â€� he said. Biswas, however, hastened to add that in West Bengal, Tripura and Kerala, there would be no electoral understanding with the Congress. In all these states, the CPM would consider both the BJP and the Congress as enemies.

Asked to comment on the staunch opposition of several Left Front constituents, including the RSP and the Forward Bloc, which were in favour of maintaining â€˜equidistanceâ€™ from both the BJP and the Congress, Biswas said, â€œThe CPM will take a stand in unison with other Left Front partners.â€� The Forward Bloc, meanwhile, bluntly refused to accept the CPMâ€™s pro-Congress stand saying no true Left party, engaged in class struggle, could support the Congress.

Forward Bloc state secretary Ashok Ghosh said his party was against offering any support to the Congress because the Congress had always been soft on communalism. Also, there was no difference between the BJP and the Congress regarding their economic policies, he said. â€œThe CPM is an independent party and is entitled to take an independent stand. But under no circumstances we will support the Congress,â€� Ghosh said.

In a sharp reaction from Delhi, RSP general secretary K. Pankajakshan said the CPMâ€™s unilateral stand to support the Congress would tantamount to sacrificing Left unity. â€œThe RSP is dismayed over the manner the CPM expressed its support to the Congress even before the Congress expressed its desire to seek alliance,â€� Pankajakshan said.

5,Ban on cow slaughter to be enforced strictly: minister,"LUCKNOW: Minister for animal husbandry and dairy Laxmikant Bajpayee, who was once in the eye of the storm for allegedly protecting the beef mafia in his constituency, declared at a press conference here on Friday that he would ensure that the laws were so stringently implemented that no individual had the audacity to kill cows in the state.

Months after Meerut simmered over the cow slaughter issue, Noor Ilahi, a BSP leader and owner of Yaseen Cold Storage, was arrested. Later, the name of a minister was dragged into the controversy, though Bajpayee said that the allegations were false.

With European nations being in the grip of the deadly ''mad cow disease'', the demand for beef and beef products from UP has increased drastically. The lure of quick economic benefits prompted traders to export these products abroad adversely affecting the cow population in the state.

As cow slaughter is a communally volatile issue, the UP government passed a law on September 12, 2002, banning it in the state. For the effective implementation of the UP Cow Slaughter Abolition Act and Cruelty Against Animals Abolition Act, a campaign was launched between December 2002 and March 2003 in which district officials and police were given strict instructions to arrest the people flouting the rules.

The department claimed to have sealed 54 illegal slaughter houses. Besides, six big smuggling houses were raided and closed. In Kalpi and Jalaun, 203 carcasses of slaughtered animals were found and three police officials were also arrested in this connection.

The minister ordered officials concerned to hand over two-acre land to the Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) in every district for setting up animal shelter houses and animal treatment centre. Nearly 3,000 acre of unutilised land of the animal husbandry department has been allocated for setting up cow shelters in various parts of the state.

6,Ayodhya tangle: Call for all-party meet,"LUCKNOW: Union minister of state for home Swami Chinmayanand called for an all-party meeting to find an amicable out-of-court solution to the Ayodhya dispute.

Lauding fresh initiatives by the Kanchi seer and Jayendra Saraswati and the prime minister in this regard, the Union minister said that an early solution to the century-old dispute was possible if the Congress and other opposition parties helped in creating a congenial atmosphere for talks and cooperate in the fresh initiatives.

The minister pointed that the Kanchi seerâ€™s initiative came at the right time and the prime ministerâ€™s assurance in the presence of Congress president Sonia Gandhi should be seen as a step in the right direction.

Asked about the Congress silence on the issue, the minister said that it should be seen as the opposition''s tacit support for solving the dispute through talks. He said that though the government had yet to decide how to go about on the issue but it was not averse to convening an all-party meeting on the Ayodhya issue to push forward the seer''s initiative.

There had been positive response from the Muslim organizations and those who had initially rejected the move would also join in once talks made some headway and took shape in the form of a concrete proposal or formula, he said. ""The VHP will also abide by it,"" he claimed when his attention was drawn towards the opposition by the VHP.

He suggested for initiating talks at all levels. ""Talks should be held between religious heads, leaders of the two communities and even at political level to reach a consensus,"" he said claiming that only talks could pave the way for reaching a consensus on bringing a legislation to solve the dispute.

Asked about BJP state president Vinay Katiyar raking up the temple issue, Swami Chinmayanand said that when Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had already announced to keep the issue out of politics, then all parties, including the BJP, should refrain from doing so.

Ridiculing VHP vice-president Giriraj Kishore for his controversial comments on Ram Janambhoomi Nyas chairman Mahant Ramchandra Paramhans Das suffering a stroke, the minister quipped: ""How could he make such comment when he was not even present during his meeting with Advaniji."" Kishore had stated that Mahant Das suffered a stroke after meeting Advani in Delhi recently.

Swami Chinmayanand, who is also in-charge of the north-east, said that situation in the troubled states was fast improving and he was trying to hold talks with all warring groups.

""The Centre is open for talks with any Naga group to establish peace in the region. Some headway has been made and efforts are on to bring other groups too across the table,"" he said.

7,'Yes minister' babus trip Shourie,"NEW DELHI: Disinvestment minister Arun Shourie is a man in a hurry, but now he is learning that he must watch his step to prevent being tripped by his bureaucracy.

Consider this episode that reads like a script of the BBC series, Yes, Minister. Within 10 days after he took charge as communications minister on January 30, Shourie signed a file promoting 12 junior officials in the department of information technology (DIT) and recommended to the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet (ACC) 16 more senior officials for promotion under the ''flexible complementing scheme'' for scientists.

It now turns out Shourie''s predecessor, Pramod Mahajan, had spiked these promotions because he found the employees concerned had no scientific or technical achievement to their credit. Indeed, they had little to do with science.

""This was one of the first files put up to me (after becoming the communications minister) by the DIT secretary and I did not get the impression that undeserving were being promoted,"" Shourie told Times News Network.

While the 12 junior officials were promoted through a notification on February 2, the file regarding the 16 senior officials is pending with the ACC. All that DIT additional secretary S Lakshminaraynan was willing to say when asked whether the department will withdraw its recommendation was, ""We are looking into the issue and would ensure that no one who does not deserve it will get a promotion.""

The interviews for these promotions were conducted through December 2001. All the candidates were rated ''outstanding'' by the interview committees. When the file reached Mahajan for clearance, he questioned the ratings and wanted to know the specific scientific or technical achievements made by these officials as their work did not involve any R&D activity.

When the DIT secretary, who was on the interview panels, failed to give a satisfactory answer he ordered fresh interviews.

A Department of Personnel and Training (DOPT) note of March 27, 1997, says that only scientists who have ""demonstrable achievements"" are eligible for promotion.

In this case, among those recommended for promotion as ""senior scientists"" were officials who looked after fiscal policy like customs duty, outsourcing of telemedicine, deciding grants for e-governance and co-ordinating activities of regional centres.

The DOPT note also stipulates that the minister will have the final say over the recommendations which have to be sent to the ACC within three months of the interviews. The promotions were cleared more than a year after the interviews were conducted.

8,BPCC chief criticises state govt,"PATNA: Although BPCC president Ram Jatan Sinha said here on Friday that he is neither anti-Laloo nor pro-Laloo, he could not desist himself from appealing to the party workers not to care for the RJD and concentrate on strengthening party organisation in the state.

Addressing party workers in the Sadaquat Ashram, where he was felicitated after assuming charge, he said that there is no difference between the RJD and the NDA and his endeavour would be to install the Congress in power not only in Bihar but also at the Centre. He also stated his nomination as the BPCC chief has unnerved both the RJD and NDA.

Criticising the Laloo-Rabri regime, he said that law and order situation is worst in the state and he would not hesitate to launch an agitation against the ''defects'' in the present regime on which the Congress high command has not put any restriction. Former BPCC president Rafiq Alam presided over the felicitation function.

Sinha, however, did not lag behind in accusing state party leaders and said that they should desist from making frequent visits to New Delhi. Even party headquarters, Sadaquat Ashram, would have to rise above party-politics, he stated. He also appealed to party leaders to retrospect and cooperate in strengthening party organisation in the state, ""so that we do not require the support of others"".

He said that his endeavour would be to end the present ''communication gap'' from which the state party suffers, since any communication gap increases ''dissatisfaction'' among party members. He expressed annoyance over the manner in which party activists scramble to touch his feet, saying ""discipline"" is important in Congress. ""The Congress, a mass-base party will launch ''jan sangharsha'' on public issuesâ€�.

9,Mushirul Hasan feels 'justice' pinch,"NEW DELHI: What happens when a university''s visitor nominates someone whose wife is already ""an influential member"" of the faculty? The husband is replaced so that ""justice also appears to have been done"".

President A P J Abdul Kalam, visitor of the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), has done just that by replacing noted historian Mushirul Hasan as his nominee for the selection panel of School of Social Sciences, because Hasan''s wife, Zoya Hasan, is a top faculty member of another JNU school.

Kalam has instead nominated Suhas Chakravarty, a former head of the department of history, Delhi University.

However, such instances abound â€” and they go often undetected â€” in the academic or corporate world and in judiciary, where there was a recent move that relations of a judge should not practice in the same court. Many in the academic world say if husband and wife are both holding responsible positions, neither spouse should be penalised.

""This is a colonial habit. Why should it be assumed that if two relatives are on the same panel or board, there is going to be corruption or nepotism?"" asks K Venkatasubramanian, a former vice-chancellor and currently a member of the Planning Commission.

When contacted, Mushirul Hasan said he was not aware of the changed nomination.

In the case of the Hasans, the change was decided last week. The HRD ministry apprehended that Mushirul Hasan''s appointment, when his wife, Zoya, is director of Centre for Political Studies under JNU''s School of Social Sciences, could create ""a situation that might be exploited...""

10,Colleges thumb their nose at govt,"BANGALORE: Even as the admission process to professional colleges in Karnataka was understood to have resolved with the fee structure committee finalising the package, as many as 41 â€œlike-mindedâ€™â€™ managements of unaided private medical engineering and dental colleges have come together and formed the Consortium of Medical, Engineering and Dental Colleges (COMEDK).

The consortium headed by Congress MP R.L. Jalappa with M.R. Jayaram as vice-chairman has formulated its own admission policy for professional colleges.

Former Congress MP Shamnur Shivashankarappa, who was heading COMED earlier, has quit the post after the consortium decided to challenge the governmentâ€™s guidelines on CET in the court.

In a statement here on Friday, the consortium has called for one application â€œsingle window approachâ€™â€™ on COMED member institutionsâ€” which means candidates need not make individual applications to each college.

The application format provides for naming five institutions of the candidates choice in the order of preference. The last date for applying is July 3.

The notification inviting applications is available on website www.comedk.org. Following is COMEDâ€™s admission policy:

Merit-based selection consisting of 50 per cent through COMED taking into account performance in qualifying examination and Karnataka CET and the remaining seats being filled up on the basis of performance in the qualifying examination only.

Merit list will be prepared by an independent neutral professional agency.

Provide fee concession to not more than 25 per cent of the selected students belonging to poor and weaker sections of the society. A fair and transparent approach for the remaining seats allotted by the management.

Fee structure based on cost with small surplus as ordered by the Supreme court.

An application-processing fee of Rs 250 has to be paid along with the application, by students seeking admission to the member institution of the consortium.

Member institutions of the consortium will not deviate from the guidelines of admission of the consortium and will not collect any other fee towards tuition other than tuition fee announced by them through the consortium, the release said .

The complete list of 41 colleges that have joined the COMED will be available on the website www.comedk.org from Saturday morning onwards. According to M.S. Ramaiah Group of Institution registrar Kumar, the entire list of colleges was not uploaded on Friday â€œdue to superstitionâ€™â€™.

Some of the colleges that have joined COMED: Medical Colleges â€” J N Medical College (Belgaum); JSS (Mysore); BLDE (Bijapur); MSR and KIMS (Bangalore); Devaraj Urs Medical College (Kolar); Nitte Foundation; Nijalingappa Medical College (Bagalkote); Sullya Medical College; Vaidehi Institute of Medical Sciences (Bangalore); MRMC (Gulbarga) and AIMS (Bellur).

12,"Centre biased against Bihar, says minister","PATNA: Bihar energy minister Shakeel Ahmed Khan on Thursday charged the Union government with bias against the state and dilly-dallying on the launch of energy infrastructure projects as recommended by the Planning Commission.

According to a PRD release issued here, Khan made this charge at the statesâ€™ energy ministersâ€™ confe-rence held in New Delhi on Thursday. Khan demanded that the Union energy ministry complete the Indrapuri and Kaimur hydro power projects.

He also alleged that the Centre had maintained an irresponsible approach in the project for restructuring of the Kanti thermal power station, Muzaffarpur.

He stressed on the inclusion of the long-pending Kaimur hydro power project in the list of projects for implementation in the 10th five-year plan. He added that the Union energy ministry had adopted a negative stance towards Bihar on the issue of ownership of Tenughat power project.

13,Govt calls all-party meet on Paragodu,"HYDERABAD/BANGALORE: The state government has called an all-party meeting on Saturday to discuss the Paragodu issue ahead of a visit by a team of officials from the Central Water Commission (CWC) to ascertain the facts.

The government decision comes in the wake of Prime Minister Vajpayeeâ€™s decision to depute a Central Water Commission team to visit the project site in Bagepalli taluk in Karnataka on Saturday.

The CWC team is expected to meet Andhra Pradesh officials later in Hyderabad.

The team will be led by committee member S K Das and the CWC chief engineer based in Hyderabad, Jyothi.

The team will visit Paragodu to get a first-hand account of the project being executed on the Chitravati river to provide drinking water to Bagepalli, Guddibande and 88 villages.

Karnataka law minister D B Chandre Gowda told reporters in Bangalore on Friday that Karnataka was clear about the stand it will present to the central delegation: the project will not be stopped and the Prime Minister has been so told.

â€œNo question of stopping work. No question of talksâ€�, he said. â€œThey (the CWC officials) want to observe. They can observe and go.â€™â€™ Andhra Pradesh on the other hand called the all-party meeting to present a united stance on the dispute. Senior TDP MP C Ramachandraiah justified calling for an all-party meeting two days after the chief minister refused to have one.

â€œThe meeting has been called to explore all possible avenues to resolve the crisis. We do not want to get the blame,â€� he said.

The Congress, BJP, CPM and CPI had demanded an allparty meeting so that the the stateâ€™s political formations can adopt a unified stance on the issue. The chief minister opposed such a meeting, insisting instead that Congress president Sonia Gandhiâ€™s should persuade Karnataka chief minister S M Krishna to stop the project.

14,Pope has no business commenting on our law: Jaya,"CHENNAI: Taking on the Pope for the concern he expressed about the anti-conversion law in Tamil Nadu, CM J Jayalalithaa said the pontiff had no business to comment on the subject.

He has no authority to comment about any legislation passed in any democratically elected state government in this country,"" she said. She pointed out that people in this country were free to practice any religion of their choice, more so in Tamil Nadu.

To a question if the AIADMK was closer to the BJP in ideology regarding the anti-conversion law, she said there could be similarities and dissimilarities, but it did not matter. Though the AIADMK and the DMK have similar ideologies, they do not get along, she pointed out.

Expressing confidence that there was ""every possibility of a third front"", the AIADMK chief said her party will play a ""decisive role"" in national politics.

Addressing the media on Friday afternoon at the secretariat here, she said: ""No combination will be able to form a government at the Centre if it does not have AIADMK''s support.""

15,Pvt hospitals can't perform heart surgeries under govt scheme,"PUNE: In a significant development, the directorate of health services, Pune circle, has restricted private hospitals from performing cardiac surgeries under the state-run Jeevan Dayee Arogya Yojana.

So far, two city-based private hospitals, apart from the Military hospital (Cardio-Thoracic Centre) and the Poona chest hospital, performed the surgeries under the scheme.

As per the plan now, all cardiac surgery cases under the Jeevan Dayee Arogya scheme will be referred to the newly-created cardio-thoracic unit at Sassoon general hospital and the Military hospital.

""In case of pressure on these two facilities, we might consider referring some cases to private hospitals,"" health services deputy director B.P. Gaikwad told TNN.

Launched in 1997, the scheme provides financial assistance of up to Rs 70,000 to patients below the poverty line to undergo cardiac surgery.

While Gaikwad said the decision was taken to help promote government health care centres, a senior source confirmed that an internal inquiry by the directorate had revealed financial irregularities by a private hospital.

The inquiry, according to the official, was taken up following complaints from some quarters that the hospital was taking undue advantage of the government scheme.

17,Mumbai inspector arrested in Telgi stamp paper scam,"PUNE/MUMBAI: Assistant police inspector (API) Dilip Pandurang Kamat of the Dharavi police station, Mumbai, became the 44th accused in the infamous Telgi fake stamp papers scam, when he was arrested by the Mumbai police at 10 am in Mumbai and produced before judicial magistrate first class , K.M. Jaiswal, in Pune on Friday evening.

Kamat, who has been arrested under Sections 467, 468, 470 and 471 of the Indian penal code (IPC) for forgery, and Section 4 of the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) for money laundering, was presented before Jaiswal at the latter''s residence, as he was brought into the city after the court working hours.

Public prosecutor Raja Thakare pleaded for a 30-day police remand. He said one of the diaries found during investig tions stated that Rs 50,000 had been paid to Kamat. Also, Jamir Ahmed, co-accused in the scam, had in his confessional statement told the investigating team that Kamat had been given Rs 33 lakh in a deal.

""Given these findings, we would need police custody of 30 days to interrogate the accused in detail,"" Thakare said.

Defence counsels S.K. Jain and Viraj Kakade argued that the charges against their client did not warrant month-long custody.

Based on arguments from both sides, Jaiswal announced 13-day police custody for Kamat.

Manish Mehta, an alleged aide of Telgi, was arrested from his Ghatkopar residence by the special investigation team (SIT) on Thursday and has been remanded to police custody till June 26. He is accused of financing the purchase of printing machinery used to make the fake stamp papers.

Kamat''s arrest comes close on the heels of anti-corruption crusader Anna Hazare''s public interest litigation in the Bombay high court, demanding that the state government take action against the officers indicted by deputy inspector-general S.K. Jaiswal, head of the SIT, in his report.

Kamat was booked by the Mumbai police on charges of conniving with Abdul Karim Telgi, the prime accused in the scam. He was arrested from his Chembur residence and brought to Pune, to be produced before the special court hearing the case.

The officer was under suspension since January this year when he was caught allegedly giving special treatment to Telgi.

Kamat had taken Telgi to his Cuffe Parade flat in order to search the flat in January.

However,when Jaiswal made a surprise visit to Telgi''s flat, he found that Telgi was having tea and chatting with Kamat.

19,"Gujarat govt not heeding NHRC advice, says Anand","PUNE: National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) chairman A.S. Anand on Friday expressed utter anguish at the Gujarat government''s constant refusal to heed to the NHRC''s recommendations following the Godhra carnage, but, at the same time, said the commission didn''t have the powers to force the state government to implement its recommendations.

Speaking to TNN on the sidelines of a day-long meeting with NGOs of three states here on Friday morning, the former chief justice of India said all its recommendations, one being that special courts be set up to try select cases of carnage, are lying dormant.

""Despite repeated reminders, the Narendra Modi government doesn''t seem keen to secure speedy justice for the riot victims,"" Anand said, adding that this is apparent from the government''s constant refusal to heed to any of the NHRC''s recommendations.

The NHRC''s recommendations include: handing over of some riot cases to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI); judges of the special courts be hand-picked by the chief justice of the Gujarat high court; special prosecutors be appointed, if needed; and special efforts be initiated to depute responsible officers, particularly women officers, to assist in handling cases of traumatised victims.

It had also recommended that specific time-frame be fixed for thorough and expeditious completion of investigations, besides involving NGOs to collect material.

Anand said many witnesses had turned hostile, while in many cases, there seems to be no urgency on part of the state agencies to complete the investigations.

""This is a grave matter, but, unfortunately, even the NHRC cannot go beyond a point,"" Anand said, adding that a decision to move the witnesses outside the state for deposition is pending with the supreme court.

No action has been taken on an earlier recommendation of implementing police reforms in the state, he said, adding that the suggestion was put forth in order to preserve the integrity of the investigating process and to insulate it from any extraneous influences.

Earlier, about 20 representatives from Gujarat held a detailed discussion with Anand and submitted a memorandum, stating the prevailing situation there and seeking the intervention of the NHRC.

The memorandum, while pointing out that the NHRC recommendations have not been complied with, stated that fear and insecurity still reigned supreme in the lives of a vast section of society.

Pointing out the Best bakery case, in which the witnesses have turned hostile, the delegation, led by veteran journalist Digant Oza, called upon the immediate intervention of the commission, failing which, many other cases will collapse in a similar manner.

Out of total 4,205 cases registered in connection with the riots, only half of the accused have been charge-sheeted, and out of the charge-sheeted accused, 32 have already been acquitted, the memorandum said.

21,VHP slams Antony government on Marad probe,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: A Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) leader Saturday criticised the Kerala government for its alleged failure to book the real culprits behind a communal massacre in Marad last month.

VHP state organising secretary Kummanam Rajasekharan claimed the current investigation into the May 2 killings of eight Hindus and a Muslim in the coastal hamlet in Kozhikode district was a ""farce"". He demanded a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).

""The crime branch probe currently going on is a farce. Close to 90 people have been arrested and we feel this is a drama enacted by the police because the actual culprits who have the blessings of influential political personalities are still at large,"" Rajasekharan alleged here.

He said Hindu groups were conducing a campaign to press for a CBI probe into the Marad killings.

""We have just ended the first phase of our campaign and we are to launch the second phase on June 16 when the assembly session begins. Hundreds of women belonging to several Hindu organisations would sit in front of the state secretariat demanding a CBI probe,"" said the VHP leader.

The May 2 massacre in Marad was apparently to avenge the killing of five people in January last year.

After last month''s deaths, while Chief Minister A.K. Antony appealed for calm, top Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and federal minister O. Rajagopal added a controversial twist to the matter by indirectly blaming state Industries Minister P.K. Kunjalikutty, who belongs to the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML).

Rajasekharan added fuel to the fire Saturday by indirectly making the same allegation and saying Kunjalikutty should apologise for failing to bring peace in Marad after the January 2002 violence.

Kunjalikutty was at the forefront of peace talks in Marad after the first round of communal killings.

""All those who sat to his left and right during the peace talks are today in jail for the May 2 attack. These are all circumstantial evidences that point to the involvement of Kunjalikutty,"" alleged the VHP leader.

Rajasekharan also came down heavily on the Antony government for booking Hindu leaders for distributing publicity material in the form of posters and CDs in the aftermath of the Marad killings. Close to 250 people have been booked so far.

""We have no plans to whip up Hindu passion. We just want to highlight the real truth,"" claimed the VHP leader.

""When the Babri Masjid (mosque in Ayodhya) was razed, video and poster campaigns were done here and was in fact encouraged. Today when we do that we are being booked. This is a clear case of persecuting Hindus,"" he charged.

22,Cabbies dodge seat-belt rule,"MUMBAI: In a case that drives home the absurdity of bureaucracy, the traffic authorities have made safety belts mandatory for some motorists, but not for others, while cabbies appear exempt.

As per supreme court guidelines, four-wheel light motor vehicles manufactured after 1994 need seat belts for drivers and front-seat passengers. Now, according to the latest Road Traffic Office notification, even those travelling in the rear seats of cars manufactured after October 2002 must strap up.

But Mumbai''s 55,000 taxis seem exempt from such rules.

Most cabbies claim their vehicles are of pre-1994 vintage. However, even those driving post-1994 taxis do not wear belts. In fact, many cabbies yank the belts out of their seats.

While cabbies openly flout the seat-belt rule, motorists are rigorously penalised. The traffic police collected Rs 16.33 lakhs in fines from January to April 2003 from those who weren''t using seat belts.

Cabbies go scot-free because the only way to ascertain the year their vehicles were manufactured is to check their registration books randomly, explained C.T. Golani, a senior RTO official.

Safety experts at the Western India Automobile Association (WIAA) question the logic for pre-1994 taxis not being required to have seat belts.

""Heavy motor vehicles, like buses and trucks, do not require seat belts since the chances of being ejected from such vehicles during an accident are very few,"" said WIAA president Sunil Merchant. ""But are taxis manufactured before 1994 any less prone to accidents than the rest?""

A.L. Quadros, general secretary of the Bombay Taximen''s Union, contended that cabbies driving in heavy city traffic do not need to be strapped in.

""In a city where the maximum speed-limit of a taxi rarely exceeds 60 kph, the injury caused by collisions is negligible,"" he said. ""Only on the highway is the rule necessary.""

23,"Bank employees, PSEB men face the wrath of farmers","BATHINDA: As the panchayat elections slated for June 29 are coming near, the agitation of Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) is getting more intense in the area. And it is the employees of Primary Agriculture Development Banks (PADB), cooperative banks and Punjab State Electricity Board (PSEB) who are in a fix over the recovery of loans from the farmers and over the issue of checking of power meters.

To mount pressure on the Punjab government so that it softens its stand on the recovery of loans and releases all defaulting farmers arrested for non-payment of loan, the BKU leaders and activists are laying siege to the banks. They also detained bank officials when they went to villages for the recovery of loans.

PSEB employees are also facing the ire of the farmers in rural areas when they go to the villages for the routine inspection and for electricity meter readings.

On Friday, when a PSEB team went to Sibian village, near Bathinda, for inspection of electricity meters, they were allegedly manhandled and detained by some villagers.

The team, which was led by a sub-divisional officer (SDO), was restrained from doing their job for about three hours. The police have registered a criminal case against five persons on the SDOâ€™s complaint.

On the other hand, the activists of the BKU along with some employees of the PSEB organised dharnas in front of the offices of superintending engineers and executive engineers in Bathinda, Mansa, Sangrur, Muktsar, Ferozepur, Faridkot and Moga district on Friday.

If the BKU activists were protesting against the withdrawal of free power supply, the PSEB employees were opposing the state governmentâ€™s move of privatisation of the board.

In Nathana town of Bathinda, 200 BKU members sat on an indefinite dharna in front of the PADB branch on Friday to protest against the registration of criminal cases against some union members at Lehrakhana village this week.

Raising slogans against the state government and bank officials, the BKU leaders alleged that despite an assertion by the Punjab chief minister in January that no farmer would be handcuffed or his land auctioned for recovery of loans, the farmers were being arrested and their land auctioned.
