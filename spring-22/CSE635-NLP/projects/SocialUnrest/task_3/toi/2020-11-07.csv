0,Wagal's arrest highlights rot in city police,"MUMBAI: The arrest of serving IPS officer Shridhar Wagal highlights the rot in the Mumbai police, said former police chiefs.

â€œMr Wagalâ€™s arrest is a disgrace for the Indian Police Service, particularly the Maharashtra cadre,â€™â€™ said former Mumbai police commissioner Satish Sahney.

â€œThe deterioration has not been sudden. It has been going on for the last ten years and one of the factors responsible for it is the lobbying for top posts,â€™â€™ said former Mumbai police commissioner D.S. Soman.

His predecessor Julio Ribeiro blamed the politicians for choosing the wrong persons to lead the police force.

He said citizens should now demand to know the reasons for appointing Mr Wagal as the head of Mumbaiâ€™s crime branch. A retired director-general of the stateâ€™s anti-corruption bureau said Mr Wagalâ€™s arrest was possible because there are officers of integrity in the SIT.

Sahney said that if the wrong type of people are posted at top-level posts even the best of systems can be ruined. Ribeiro said police officers should now start serving the people instead of serving themselves and their political masters.

1,Najma blamed for delay in riot funds,"NEW DELHI: Rajya Sabha membersâ€” Eduardo Faleiro of the Congress and Kuldip Nayar, since retiredâ€” have charged that Najma Heptulla refused to reply to their request to spend money from their share of the MPLADS (MPsâ€™ Local Area Development Scheme) for victims of the Gujarat violence. Heptulla chairs the Rajya Sabha committee looking after the scheme.

Prime Minister Vajpayee had approved Falerioâ€™s request to spend Rs 1 crore in Gujarat but he is still not sure whether the committee has approved it or not. Heptulla, on the other hand, says she is unaware of these developments.

Nayar and Faleiro say they approached the MPLADS committee last year, when violence was still on, for spending their money in Gujarat. Members had earlier been permitted to spend their money in states other than those they represent in times of calamities such as the Orissa cyclone and the Gujarat earthquake.

According to the MPLADS guidelines, an elected Rajya Sabha member can opt for development schemes in one or more districts of the state he represents and nominated members are allowed to select projects in one or more districts throughtout the country.

Both say that for months, they did not hear from the committee. But Heptulla said she had told the two MPs â€˜â€˜orallyâ€™â€™ that their request did not fall under the schemeâ€™s guidelines.

Nayar, however, maintained that Heptulla should have given him this information in writing. â€˜â€˜She never did and my term ended,â€™â€™ he told TNN.Heptulla said there was nothing to stop Nayar from spending money in Gujarat. As a nominated member, he was free to do so. But Nayar has a different take on this. â€˜â€˜The committeeâ€™s approval is mandatory even if I wished to spend it anywhere. My point is that the approval never came.â€™â€™

Faleiro, after waiting in vain for the committeeâ€™s nod, wrote to the PM on June 16 last year requesting him to relax the rules for â€˜â€˜the benefit of the victims of the recent Gujarat holocaustâ€™â€™. He also outlined that his money be used for â€˜â€˜compensation for damaged/burnt/destroyed houses as per the norms adopted for earthquake victimsâ€™â€™ .

In November last year, Vijay Goel, the then minister of state for statistics and programme implementation, wrote to Faleiro that his request has been accepted.

His letter was forwarded to South Goa collector for transfer of funds to the Gujarat chief secretary. But Faleiro says he is yet to â€˜â€˜hear from the committeeâ€™â€™.

Heptulla, on her part, says :â€˜â€˜Faleiro met me several times but never told me that he has approached the PM. Even Goel, who interacted with me for MPLADs, never told me about it,â€™â€™ she explains.

3,Resource mobilisation an uphill task for govt,"LUCKNOW: For a state which avoided sizable hike in taxes for the past few years, achieving the target of resource mobilisation can be an uphill task. This holds true in case of Uttar Pradesh when the spectre of elections is looming over the state.

Faced with poor record of resource mobilisation, chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav constituted a resource mobilisation committee with his trusted minister Azam Khan as its head.

This committee, said an official, was asked to solicit opinion of departmental heads for speeding up resource mobilisation drive. But in view of the state''s poor record on resource mobilisation, this decision may not bring much cheer to the government.

Let us take a look at the state''s revenue collection records. The state''s own tax revenue collection was short of target by Rs 502 crore in 2000-01. This subsequently went up to Rs 1,230.89 crore in 2001-02.

The state''s budget for 2002-03 had placed the state''s own revenue accruing from taxes at Rs 13,427.22 crore from Rs 11,502.19 crore during 2001-02.

Since major contributors to the state''s tax revenue like trade tax and excise duty did not yield as much as were expected, it seems difficult for the state to improve its economy in the near future.

The trade and excise were expected to net an increase by 18 per cent and 17 per cent in revenue, respectively, during 2002-2003 over the previous year. This did not happen owing to a number of factors.

The state had suffered a shortfall of nearly Rs 128 crore in its non-tax revenue during 2001-02. This went up to Rs 141.96 crore during 2002-03. For the year 2002-03, a target of Rs 1,947.20 crore has been set. This is more than Rs 300 crore over and above the revised estimates of 2001-02 and, by all means, a tall order for the government.

The government''s two decisions, reducing user charges for medical facilities and bringing down students'' fees, have caused a drain on its economy.

Although the reduction of user charges on medical facility will essentially hit the hospital''s infrastructure facility, the curtailment in students'' fees will, in all probability, hit the government''s coffers.

Along with these, the government will have to give a huge amount to employees as retirement benefits.

Thousands of employees will be nearing retirement in the current financial year, owing to extension given to them by the Rajah Singh government. This will again put a drain on the state''s economy.
