0,Bloc picks holes in big brother rule,"kolkata: the forward bloc is turning out to be a rather nagging partner of the cpm. on the first day of the ongoing state conference of the party at netaji indoor stadium on friday, the forward bloc grabbed the opportunity to lash out against big brother, albeit without naming them. during the 24-year-rule of the front, gram panchayats in the state had turned into centres of corruption and nepotism, leaders said. they also said that a section of political leadership were the prime patrons of corruption in the local bodies. in a document placed for discussion during the conference, the forward bloc observed that when the left front first came to power two decades ago, it had decided to turn the gram panchayats into instruments of struggle for the poor and the oppressed. instead, the panchayats were converted into the main centres of corruption in the state. as a result, the front failed to bring in class conscious leaders from the poorer sections in the left movement. without naming the cpm, the forward bloc said that capture of power by unscrupulous means had become the prime objective a section of the leaders who were encouraging nepotism and corruption. the party also criticised the state government's increasing dependence on the ngos saying that world capital was finding entry into the countryside through many of the ngos. to remedy the malady, the forward bloc suggested a six point formula which included abolition of one party rule of the cpm in the district administration, corporations, councils and all the local bodies. collective leadership of all the constituents of the front should be established, the party suggested. challenging the monopoly of the cpm in the administration, the forward bloc suggested that individual ministries and not the panchayats, should be allowed to design the plans of the respective departments. also, the local mlas and the mps should be included in the district planning committees and, if necessary, laws should be amended for the purpose, the party said. forward bloc leader jayanta roy later said that his party was publicly airing these views in order to rectify the mistakes of the left front. the people can not be allowed to suffer because of the left front's mistakes. if the cpm finds anything wrong with our observations, let them say so openly, he said.

1,Fate of civic polls hangs in balance,"pune: anxiety grips the city political circles as the fate of the civic elections scheduled on february 10 hangs in balance with the state government and the election commission giving contradictory affidavits in the bombay high court which is deciding the petition challenging the de-linking of the villages. the election commission has stated that it had asked the state government to restrain from issuing the notification to de-link the villages as the commission had kicked off the election process for the february civic polls. however, the state government went ahead with the de-linking, notwithstanding the warning by the commission that the move would adversely affect the election process. the state government on the other hand has argued that the state cabinet had taken then decision to de-link the villages much ahead of the commission's decision to hold the elections. the government has argued that it had consulted the pmc before de-linking the villages and its decision to de-link the villages was based on a report tabled by divisional commissioner mr umeshchandra sarangi. ironically, both the commission and the state government have made a reference that they had consulted the pmc before arriving at the decision.. hence, there is anxiety in the city's political circles over the pmc administration's say in the matter. according to sources, the pmc administration submitted its affidavit in the matter in the high court on thursday evening, the exact details of which will be known only after the case starts on friday.

5,Tuskerâ€™s death: Poaching ruled out,"lucknow: the elephant which was found dead under mysterious circumstances in the deep grasslands of dudhwa national park on wednesday would now be used as a specimen at a nature interpretation centre in one of the zoos in up. a decision to this effect was taken by chief wildlife warden rl singh on friday after an autopsy was conducted on the dead pachyderm by a senior vet from the indian veterinary research institute (ivri) bareilly, bn arora. to avoid any pilferage of the body parts of the animal after it was buried in the thickets, the forest department top brass decided that the head and the legs of the animal be brought to the national park headquarters where it would be preserved, later filled with husk and displayed for people, specially kids. confirming this, deputy director of dudhwa national park ashish tewari told times news network over phone that the forest staff had severed the head of the elephant from its body (alongwith the 3-feet long tusks) and had sawed the four legs and brought it along. the remaining body was buried after treating it with lime and salt (for quick decay). the bones of the animal would be dug in febrary, the official said. ruling out any foul play in the death of the elephant, tewari said during the physical examination of the spot and the post-mortem, the death was found to be a result of a scuffle between two tuskers belonging to the same herd. at the place of the discovery of the elephant corpse there were tell tale signs of presence of elephant herds, including trampled grass, he said. during the post-mortem it was found that the dead elephant had a large hole at the centre of its chest which apparently was result of a tusker's attack on it. we also concluded that elephants had looked after the ailing member of their herd and the death was not instantaneous, said rl singh who returned to the state capital after a physical verification of the scene of incident and the animal. since the nails and the tusks were intact even after fifteen days of its death, it conclusively ruled out hands of poaching gangs in the incident, tewari said. the dead animal had been fed upon by jackals, tigers and other scavengers as was evident from presence of fresh scat. the pathological tests of the scat ruled out presence of poison in the flesh.

6,Civic body polls on schedule,"pune: the pune municipal corporation general elections are likely to be held as per schedule on february 10, with the bombay high court postponing the hearing of the petition challenging the de-linking of the 20 fringe villages from the pmc limits till january 9. the court which began hearing the case on friday has not issued any directive to the state election commission or the pmc to put on hold the ongoing election process. according to political observers, the court's decision to postpone the hearing of the delinking case has ensured that the civic polls will be held as per schedule. this is so because the code of conduct would come into force from january 4 and under a supreme court ruling, once the code of conduct is enforced, the election process cannot be stalled. it may be noted here that in its affidavit before the court the state government had stated that the election commission and the pmc's election office has more then two months to re-demarcate the municipal wards in such a manner that the de-linked villages are kept out of the civic polls. the re-demarcation of wards can still be undertaken as the code of conduct is yet to be enforced, the state had asserted. however, now, by the time the case comes up for hearing the code of conduct would be in force and as such the state government will not be able to press for re-demarcation of wards. also, municipal commissioner t. c. benjamin and pmc's election officer rajendra nimbalkar have tabled an affidavit in the court stating that they will need at least 60 days for re-demarcating the wards and an additional 97 days to complete the election process. the pmc has thus made it clear that it will not be able to maintain the february 10 election date nor the outermost deadline of march 15 for holding the civic polls if it is asked to redemarcate the wards. the state government had insisted on re-demarcation of wards as the present ward formation structure includes the area of the de-linked villages. the government had argued that there was no point in holding civic elections in the de-linked villages which are now governed by the zilla parishad.

8,HC tells govt to ensure peace during Xmas,"ahmedabad: the gujarat high court has asked the state government to maintain law and order in ahwa (dangs) and to sympathetically consider the issue of preliminary examinations in schools during christmas and new year. the state government has also been asked to consider the petition as a representation and hear it and decide upon it before december 24. the order was passed by justice y b bhatt on friday, based on a petition filed by samson christian of the all india christian council against the state of gujarat. advocate p c fernandes along with r d raval appeared for the petitioner. the petitioner had sought directions from the hc against the state to ensure law and order situation and the safety of the christians, specifically in the districts of surat and ahwa (dangs) during christmas and new year. it was also sought that the state's action to conduct preliminary examinations during december 26, 2001, to january 4, 2002, should be quashed and set aside. a restriction on rallies and speeches by anti-christian elements as well as orders to protect the lives and properties of christians during christmas and new year to ensure smooth festivity by taking necessary action was also sought. secretary, home department, district collectors of dangs and surat, additional chief secretary of education department and the minister of education have been made respondents. it was also submitted by the petitioner that for the last few years there is a steady increase of anti-christian elements who disturb the communal peace and harmony, especially during christmas and new year. the petitioner alleged that some 'hardcore hindu organisations' and some anti-christian elements have started delivering aggressive speeches against the christians in ahwa (dangs) and halmudi in vyara of surat district. the petitioner also said that the situation is heating up and the preliminary exams were scheduled during christmas only to disturb the festivities.

9,Panchayat polls add to problems on X-mas eve,"surat: security during christmas in dangs, the district which witnessed attacks on churches three years back, has assumed a different dimension this year with authorities apprehensive about a fall-out of the rivalries during the panchayat elections on sunday on the festivities. a heavy police bandobast has been made in several pockets of south gujarat which have a sizeable christian presence. a senior district official said, ""we are trying to ensure that nobody uses the panchayat elections to foment trouble."" an alert has been sounded in rural surat where there is some fresh tension in the villages around halmodi, where a temple has just been built on a disputed site. the officials are, however, putting up a brave front in spite of the fact that dangs district has almost completely rejected the 'samras' scheme of the government for unanimous elections. only two out of 70 panchayats have gone for unanimous elections to be entitled to the incentives offered by the government. ""there is a sea change from the situation prevailing in 1998 and in 2001. we will ensure that christmas is celebrated not only peacefully, but with a traditional warmth,"" said a confident mukesh kumar, district collector, dangs. besides deployment of police in the entire region, the administration has made elaborate arrangements for group patrolling of the villages during christmas celebrations to ensure safety of its two lakh populace. special arrangements have been made at the 12 villages of dangs which were target of the attacks three years back, which resulted in a visit by prime minister vajpayee to assuage the hurt feelings of christians following an international outrage. the dangs superintendent of police, anupam singh gehlot, informed that four companies of state reserve police, besides 300 policemen, has been requisitioned for election duty in dangs and they would stay there till the new year. a missionary active in south gujarat said, ""though there has not been any cause for tension, we are apprehensive."" an overcautious administration also refused permission to a convention and community kitchen organised by the asharam bapu sect between december 25 and december 31. ""we convinced them not to press for their demand and the event was postponed for january next year,"" said ghelot. the 'pratista samaroh' of a ram temple in halmodi village of surat rural district on december 1 also went peacefully with the help of local religious and community leaders. the occasion had all the trappings of playing a spoilsport as it was actually scheduled for december 25, but organisers relented to prepone it. disputes over the ownership rights of the land for a prayer hall and the temple were also solved after referring to land records. the halmodi land had a christian prayer hall in place about a year back till the owner decided he was converting himself back to hinduism and offered the land for construction of a temple. the issue had incited passions in rural surat last year.

10,Guidelines on urban development soon,"ahmedabad: new urban development initiatives being worked out by the state government talk of better water and power supply, roads, drainage, sewage and of course speedy quake rehabilitation. post-quake, urban development in gujarat is all about shunning lofty multi-crore development projects. the department seems to have adopted a down-to-earth approach focusing first on providing basic amenities to gujarat and only then moving on to infrastructural ""frills"" like amusement parks, shopping malls etc. while this lacklustre approach could be attributed to the paucity of funds in the state treasury, authorities in gandhinagar insist that this shift of focus is necessary to set priorities straight. the state urban development minister, i k jadeja, told tnn, ""first things first. till date gujarat's 143 nagarpalikas and six municipal corporations had no uniformity in approach, resulting in varying development within the state. this will change soon, as we are formulating guidelines to ensure equal growth and development in all urban centres. and, our focus naturally is towards establishing and upgrading basic amenities before moving on to infrastructural luxuries."" for the 143 municipalities a structured approach has already been designed, complete with a carrot and stick policy. from now on development grant from the urban development department and the state municipal finance board will only be given after the money allocated for first phase of work on basic amenity projects is utilised up to 70 per cent by the municipalities. municipalities with the best development record will also be awarded and given special development grants. a very optimistic jadeja said, ""a little more than 50 per cent of the first phase of a rs 160-crore urban development project taken up under the vajpayee vikash yojna (vvy) has been completed till date. we hope to complete the rest of the first phase by june 30."" this despite the fact that vvy was launched over 18 months back. the department is now hoping to start the second phase of vvy in all municipalities by the first week of july. while work on drawing up uniform growth guidelines for all municipalities and municipal corporations is expected to get over in another 45 days, the state government's other priority now is completing post-quake rehabilitation by december 31. the urban development ministry has resolved to allow owners of broken homes in ahmedabad to rebuild their houses as they were. ""my department has perused 69 cases of building collapse in the city, on recommendations from ahmedabad municipal corporation (amc). we have decided to lend a humane touch to the rebuilding process by allowing the faux pas to remain,"" said jadeja. on the other hand, the state government claims to have designed a set of four rules to keep builders from ""misusing"" the leniency shown in this regard. the rules make it mandatory for the over 1,300 families to apply for rebuilding broken homes themselves, the piece of land in question must be registered in the name of the owner and the new construction should adhere to seismic-building norms. a three-member committee, consisting of the chairman of ahmedabad urban development authority (auda), commissioner of amc and town planner for ahmedabad, has been constituted to supervise the rebuilding process and ensure that builders do not take advantage of the situation. ""another builder-deterrent is there in the policy, which disallows transfer of ownership of these rebuilt houses for a period of three years,"" said jadeja. for kutch, the state government has allocated rs 500 crore for the first phase rebuilding of rapar, anjar, bhuj and bhachau. this sum is part of the rs 700 crore aid from asian development bank. the remaining rs 200 crore will be used to address post-quake needs across 10 cities of saurashtra. but how far the toned-down urban development targets will be implemented remains to be seen. for ground realities suggest that what the state minister for urban development claims is yet to trickle down to the beneficiaries.

11,Lawyers dispute date of Dutt's arrest,"mumbai: in an interesting debate before the designated tada court, actor sanjay dutt's lawyers on thursday disputed the police claim that dutt, an accused in the 1993 serial bomb blasts, was arrested on april 19, 1993. the defence lawyers argued that there was no evidence on record to show dutt's date of arrest. the lawyers said in the absence of any evidence regarding dutt's arrest, his alleged confession was wholly inadmissible. making their submissions before tada judge p.d. kode, defence lawyers rajender singh and satish maneshinde said the alleged confession, which the prosecution has relied on to build its case against the actor, was also ""not voluntary"". they said the recording of the alleged confession did not follow proper procedure as laid down by law. singh also sought to establish that the alleged confession in which the actor said he possessed an ak-56 rifle was not recorded in a free and fair environment. ""the confession was not independently recorded,"" as the police officers including the then dcp bishnoi before whom it was recorded were connected with investigations of the blast case, the lawyers reasoned. singh pointed out that as per the prosecution, dutt was supposed to have been arrested on april 19, 1993, by a police inspector lomte, but there was no evidence to prove this. however, when asked by judge kode for his views, special public prosecutor ujjwal nikam pointed out to a remand report made by lomte which recorded the actor's arrest on april 19, after his return from mauritius. nikam said the then designated tada judge j.n. patel was also informed verbally by dutt that he was arrested on april 19. the statement was recorded in the court's roznama, he added. in response to judge kode's query, nikam said such a recording in a roznama did not amount to a substantive piece of evidence but ""as a record of court it could be read as evidence"". nikam had earlier submitted that dutt after his arrest on april 19, 1993, had made a confession on april 26 and retracted after a year on november 9, 1994. he said until his retraction, dutt never disputed his confession and on the contrary was maintaining that the weapon was for his self-defence.

12,JKLF threatens govt of dire consequences,"srinagar: after having overtly dumped their guns some years ago, the jammu and kashmir liberation front has warned the government of dire consequences in case harassment of kashmiris in the valley is not stopped. coincidentally, the pakistan-based jaish-e-mohammad outfit also has threatened the centre of attacks across the country in the coming days. in a statement issued to the local newspapers here, the jklf spokesman tahir ahmad mir has expressed concern at the reports of harassment in various parts of the country of kashmiris engaged in business, studies or getting medical treatment. he said the government of india was using the attack on parliament as a pretext for harassment, which included demands of heavy ransoms over actual and threatened arrests. india should prevent its security agencies from targeting the kasmiris and must instruct them to stop their hate campaign against them, otherwise, he threatened in the statement, consequences would be devastating. meanwhile, the jammu and kashmir police have released mufti abdul rahim geelani, the brother of delhi-based college teacher a r geelani, allegedly involved in the terrorist attack on parliament. mufti, an imam of a local mosque at baramulla, was arrested by the police along with 10 others on december 18. the police also released two persons with identical names, ashiq hussian. one of them is studying computer science in bangalore while the other is a cable operator in sopore. the computer student was picked up when he had returned from bangalore to celebrate id with his parents at sopore. in the other statement, the jaish-e-mohammad outfit has said that it will carry out attacks across the country and intensify militant activities in jammu and kashmir. quoting a jaish spokesman, abu hamza, a local news agency reported that the outfit would launch shocking attacks in major cities of india so that the bjp loses power. the ""retaliatory"" attacks will create history, they have been quoted to have threatened.

13,PM meets BJP leaders on UP polls,"new delhi: with highly emotive political issues like the coffin scam bound to cast a long shadow on the bjp's fortunes in the all-important uttar pradesh assembly elections, the party has begun gearing up for the polls with a high-level meeting being held at the prime minister's residence on friday. according to spokesman and general secretary sunil shastri, the review meeting was attended by home minister advani, human resources development minister murli manohar joshi, up chief minister rajnath singh, party president jana krishnamurthy, general secretaries pyarelal khandelwal and sunil shastri. shastri said the leaders were of the opinion that the party as of now should contest around 300 seats. though this is a preliminary meeting and seat adjustments with the allies would only be decided later, shastri said the leaders discussed the situation in the state with those who have completed a tour of the districts. according to state-level functionaries, the terrorist attack on parliament has neutralised the impact of the coffin scam as a political issue and any military or diplomatic response to the terrorist attack would further alter the political agenda for up polls.

14,Pawar backs govt on terror law,"new delhi: in a carefully crafted political stance, nationalist congress party president sharad pawar on friday declined to comment on the coffin scam, refused to blame 'security lapse' for the december 13 terror strike at parliament, and debunked opposition to poto, which, he said, most states supported but with amendments. asked at a crowded press conference here whether his stand on the cag report on emergency defence purchases, parliament attack and poto indicated he was moving closer to the bjp-led nda at the centre, pawar said 'no'. and as if to prove his point, he criticised the bjp for trying to whip up sentiments in the name of fighting terrorism ""which will harm the country"". in comments that indicated he has distanced himself from the opposition camp, pawar, himself former defence minister, refused to be drawn into discussion on the controversial coffin scam, for which the opposition is demanding defence minister george fernandes' resignation. ""i have not read the cag report, and it is not fair for me to comment on the basis of newspaper reports,"" he said. the maharashtra strongman also declined to blame the government or ""security lapse"" for the december 13 terror strike at parliament. he admitted that the maharashtra government had conveyed to the centre that there was a terrorist threat to parliament, but clarified that the information ""was specific"" for the day the president, the prime minister and other vvips were assembled in the central hall. ""that did not happen,"" pawar noted and added ""security lapse"" could not be blamed as ""it is not possible to totally control security. with the red light (flasher), mp's pass and home ministry pass, how can anyone be stopped at the gate?"" he thought mps were themselves to be blamed for lax security. pawar was equally defensive of the nda government on poto. he pointed out that karnataka had passed a resolution for a similar legislation and maharashtra had one in place. ""most of the states had also supported poto, but with some amendments,"" he noted. indeed, the union law ministry had recently accepted four of the eight amendments to the poto bill suggested by the ncp, he said. in response to a question on ""hot pursuit"" of terrorists across the border suggested by some sections of the sangh parivar, he said, ""the bjp is trying to create, in the name of fighting terrorism, a temper which will harm the country."" the situation, he said, ""is such that whatever action the government takes, the country has to support it"". the government action, therefore, needed to be considered carefully. the ncp chief launched the party's election campaign for uttar pradesh, where it has not got any presence, by co-opting an independent rajya sabha member, akhtar rizvi, who was elected from up with the support of the loktantrik congress. pawar said the ncp will contest a few select seats in up and also join the fray in uttaranchal, punjab and manipur. in up, senior ncp leader p a sangma was holding poll tie-up talks with ""some local parties"". pawar said the ncp will emerge the single largest party in manipur.

""the so-called sons of the soil may wake up only after we have sustained a colossal loss. by this time, world leaders in trade and commerce will make us dependents."" he urged the hasiru sene volunteers ""to study these measures and educate our gullible leaders"". k.t. gangadhar, shayla sadasivappa, b. basavareddy, r.b. nijalingappa and siddaveerappa also addressed the gathering. four die in accident: four men in a jeep belonging to a liquor company were killed on the spot, when a lorry coming from the opposite direction rammed it near bogalera hatty, 30 km from here on nh 13. the accident occurred on thursday midnight. the deceased have been identified as mallikarjunappa, pandu, purushottama and veeranna, employees of the liquor company based here. the turuvanur police are investigating.

29,How about ministership by rotation to please all?,"bangalore: as expected, chief minister s.m. krishna played safe. he remained content with adding one and filling in two slots that were vacant, throwing cold water on the hopes and anxiety of a major reshuffle, created by some sections of the media and egged on by self-centred congressmen. plus, he elevated two ministers of state to the cabinet rank saying it fulfilled the social justice concept. krishna cannot be faulted on this. he may be popular with the masses, but within the party he is compelled to walk the tightrope and keep everyone happy. he knows that if he doesn't, dissidence is bound to raise its ugly head. he was witness to the fall of one cm after another during the last congress regime in the state, leading to a humiliating defeat for the party in the 1994 assembly elections. in the exercise, krishna has within his limitations, tried to strike a caste, community and regional balance: t john returns to the ministry after paying the price for making insensitive remarks, unbecoming of a minister, on the earthquake that brought untold miseries to the people of gujarat. the cm was under pressure from the christian community to take him back, as the community's representation in the ministry was inadequate. the high command too was keen. he is not only back, but has grabbed the plum bangalore portfolio. his detractors say krishna could have selected someone else from the community. moreover, as an outsider to bangalore, they doubt whether he will do justice to the portfolio. krishna may perhaps have to hold the reins for him. b s patil sasnur, a lingayat, takes the place of allam veerabhadrappa of the same community, who had to quit the ministry after being elected president of the state congress. lingayats and vokkaligas, two powerful communities in the state, have dominated the political arena for years. krishna belongs to the vokkaliga community. he is compelled to keep the rival community happy, lest it creates trouble for him. amareshwar naik is the only new man in. krishna chose him as he belonged not only to the unrepresented raichur district but also the scheduled tribe naik community. for m shivanna and r b thimmapur, ministers of state, their elevation to the cabinet rank has come as a bonanza. how did they qualify? the two belonged to the `left-hand sect' of scheduled castes and there was a demand to give them representation at the cabinet level. in fact, not many knew of the existence of such a sect till the promotions were made. grumbling have, however, begun -- more against the two promotions than the inductions. ministers of states such as b.k. chandrashekhar, g. parameshwara and d.b. inamdar are hurt that their performance has been overlooked. for promotion to the cabinet rank shouldn't merit be the criteria, they ask. some more sections in the party are upset that udupi, chamarajanagar, haveri and bidar districts have remained unrepresented. if krishna talks of effecting a caste and regional balance, he must justify it by his actions, they say. krishna is thus a much-harried man. heartburns are normal in the congress, he says and adds it's just not possible to give ministries, boards and corporations to all the 170 members of the assembly. does this mean, another reshuffle is in the offing? ``give me a break. let me recover from this shock,'' he says. left to krishna, he will remove deadwood, retain merited ones, bring in fresh blood and limit the ministry strength to just 25 or 30. but he has his compulsions. he is at the mercy of pressure groups not just in the state congress but also in the hig command. if krishna is bent on pursuing a please-all policy, here is a piece of advice by a well-meaning citizen: give every party legislator an 18-month term as minister. by the end of five years, all the legislators would have tasted power. when not ministers, they will head boards and corporations or do party work. no heart burning. no complaints of regional and caste imbalance. no need for a reshuffle as the ministers are replaced periodically. there will be a check on corruption, that usually creeps in when one is in office for a longer period. and the cm, free from pulls and pressures, will be able to give more time to governance of the state. isn't it a good idea, mr krishna? balram.singh@timesgroup.com or balramhs@indiatimes.com.

30,Tenant law can be misused,"new delhi: landlords who have not verified the antecedents of their tenants can now be arrested and sent directly to the jail without getting bail from the police. under a new notification, anybody who violates an order of the delhi police commissioner will have to wait until the court releases him or her on bail. the police commissioner has the power to issue a special order under section 144 of the criminal procedure code. if a person violates this order, he or she is punishable under section 188 of the indian penal code. anybody charged for this offence can be punished with simple imprisonment for a term which extends to a month or with fine of rs 200. earlier, the offence was bailable. which meant that the police had the powers to release a person arrested under this section. ''but a new notification issued by the lieutenant-governor few months ago has made it non-bailable,'' a senior police official said. senior advocates, however, say the new notification can be misused by the police. former additional solicitor general abhishek singhvi says: ''the police commissioner's order has to be within the purview of the criminal procedure code and the indian penal code.'' he warns the commissioner to not pass any order which is unconstitutional and unreasonable. such an order can be challenged in court. ''the commissioner cannot prohibit a person from carrying a lunch-box inside a cinema hall. he has to specify the kind of objects which are probably a threat to the capital's security that cannot be carried while visiting a movie hall,'' singhvi says. a commissioner can issue a notification only if there is apprehension of danger. former additional solicitor general k t s tulsi says: ''such an order can be passed only in case of an emergency where circumstances do not admit serving of a notice in due time.'' tulsi claims the commissioner cannot issue an order if a special act is in existence to deal with a problem. ''for example there is the shops and establishment act which specifies the closing time of shops. the commissioner, if he has to notify any rule, has to do it under this act and not under section 144 of crpc,'' tulsi says. legal experts agree that this was required as non-verification of tenants can be seen as dangerous.
