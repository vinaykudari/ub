4,Sonia rally aims at Bundelkhand votes,"lucknow: saturday's lalitpur rally of congress president sonia gandhi could not have come at a better time for the party. with the bjp struggling to keep its base in the bundelkhand region, the success of the congress president's rally would further ensure the saffron party's decline in popularity. considered to be the most backward area in uttar pradesh, the absence of development activities in the region speaks for itself. things have not changed much during the last 12 years of non-congress rule in the state. the party president is likely to touch on this point, as she had done in her earlier three rallies at lucknow, meerut and basti. that bundelkhand figures prominently in the congress scheme of things, stems more from the fact that it was once the bastion of the party and was adequately represented in the former congress governments with ranjit singh judeo, o p richharia and beni bai getting ministerial berths. however, after the eclipse of the congress rule, the bjp secured a firm foothold. significantly, bundelkhand was also the region from where the congress rebels, led by late jitendra prasad, had surfaced in uttar pradesh. however, the wheel has turned a full circle after that as the very congressmen, who had opposed sonia gandhi's leadership in the congress, would extend her warm welcome. party mp sujan singh bundela will be incharge of the rally. sonia, who makes no bones about the ''oust bjp programme' of the congress, is likely to raise the issues that would hit the saffron party the most. ironically, the issue of non-performance of the rajnath government is taking precedence over all others. later addressing a ''kisan maha rally in lalitpur, sonia said her party was opposed to poto as it could be used against innocent people. the country did not require poto to fight the menace of terrorism. the country needs a government with a strong willpower to deal with terrorism, she said adding the bjp-led government at the centre wanted poto as it would serve their intrest. later addressing a ''kisan maha rally in lalitpur, sonia said her party was opposed to poto as it could be used against innocent people.

""the fact that some of them stood and won elections is indeed a slap on the face of all those political parties and leaders who only talk big,"" said a doctor at the kg medical college here.

12,Hot pursuit policy against J&K militants,"srinagar: given the sharp increase in militant activities in j&k after the fall of the taliban regime in afghanistan, the security forces have adopted a hot pursuit policy to flush out militants hiding in the deep jungles of the state, particularly in the north-western region of the valley. the security forces have proposed to use gunship helicopters to target the training camps established deep in the kupwara jungles. the strikes would, moreover, deter the ingression of 5,000 taliban militants waiting to cross over to j&k from pok, a senior army official told times news network. the forces, it is learnt, have cordoned the hilly areas of sogam, lolab in the border district of kupwara in north kashmir. seven hideouts of militants were destroyed in strikes in the last few days. many more such strikes would destroy the training camps established deep in the forests of kupwara and baramulla districts, according to reports. security forces have decided to launch search operations in the higher reaches of pakherpora and charar-e-sharief in central kashmir as well. combing operations will also be undertaken in kikar and shopian in pulwama district in south kashmir, the sources said. the forces even propose to flush out militants from the higher reaches of the pir panchal mountains. the militants have caused great damage to the security forces in the last two weeks on the 300-km srinagar-jammu national highway. twenty-five soldiers and a few civilians were killed on the highway last week. meanwhile, security has further been tightened along the loc in north kashmir with the reported change of stance of pervez musharraf, the pakistan military ruler, regarding discouraging the jehadi groups from recruiting volunteers and closure of training camps in pok due to the change in the afghanistan situation. foreign militants consider the kashmir valley to be a safe heaven due to the difficult terrain and high altitude mountains and the authorities here believe that they would try to sneak into j&k. even though musharraf has expressed his support to the militants in j&k, he has also desired that no madrassa in pok be allowed to impart arms training to the talibs (students). taking the strongest exception to his orders, jehadi groups like jaish-e-mohammad and lashkar-e-taiba outfits have vowed to continue their activities here and in pok.

15,"Principal secy’s replacement baffling, feel observers","shimla: recently many senior officials of the bureaucracy, some reportedly close to the rashtriya swayamsevak sangh, had been issued transfer notices by the prem kumar dhumal-led government. these transfers have evoked mixed feelings in bureaucratic and political circles of the state. however, political observers say that this sends out a message that the government is serious about implementing its policies and programmes, especially as the assembly elections are only a year away. in the past, the popularity graph of the bjp-led government had dipped considerably.to set things right, the government had undertaken 'vikas yatras' which concluded recently. the aim was to do some introspection and identify problem areas. re-establishing a bond with the masses was the major objective of the 'yatras', the feedback from which was analysed and reports say that the transfers had been made bearing this in mind.these are being viewed as efforts to 'tone up' the government, sources added. however, what has surprised almost everyone is the transfer of the chief minister's principal secretary ajay mittal. mittal was recently relieved of his charge by managing director of himachal pradesh civil supplies corporation bhim sein. mittal is said to be close to the party functionaries, besides being a former rss associate. sein, on the other hand, has been serving on 'harmless' posts. this has taken bureaucrats by surprise also. ''true the post of principal secretary requires maturity and experience, and that mittal, who has completed three years in office, is young and immature. this, however, should have been considered at the time when he was initially handed over the charge of principal secretary,'' sources said. political observers felt that by doing so the cm was trying to tell the masses that he was doing what was good for them. the replacement of asha swaroop, former finance secretary, by sk sood has also come as a surprise. it had been expected that shamsher singh, who has experience with finance, would have been handed the charge. the shifting of shamsher singh to the post of hpseb chairman, relieving chief secretary harsh gupta of the additional duty, shows that the cm does not want one man to hold two important posts, as work suffers. earlier also chief secretary goswami had been relieved of extra duties by making asha swaroop the hpseb chairman. soon harsh gupta had been handed over the charge. meanwhile, the himachal vikas congress (hvc) is unhappy with not having been consulted prior to the reshuffle. ''it is the prerogative of the cm, he can order a reshuffle anytime,'' said hvc supremo sukh ram. observers say that the himachal vikas congress has been wanting that certain senior ias officers be placed at certain posts. however, this never happened. this is expected to have a bearing on the relations between the two parties and the matter is likely to be discussed at the himachal vikas congress meet scheduled for december 16. the congress, on the other hand, has said that the reshuffle was meaningless as the cm ''is incapable of handling the bureaucracy''. former congress spokesman and mla yogendra chandra said this shows the incompetence of the cm. chandra said, ''frequent reshuffles are indicative of the fact that the cm has no confidence in his team.work suffers as it takes time for the new officers to get acquainted with the new set up.''

16,'Anti-incumbency mood prevailing in state',"ferozepur: ""today's electorate is more aware and educated and hence his expectations from the government has increased manifold, resulting in the anti-incumbency mood which is prevailing in the state,"" said state bjp president brij lal rinwa in a press conference here on sunday. however, he said the anti-incumbency wave would not affect the prospects of sad-bjp alliance in the coming assembly elections in the state. rinwa, who was here to take part in a religious function, was accompanied by anil sareen, state general secretary of bjp. ajay bir singh sodhi, district general secretary ashwani dhingra and district bjp president davinder pal were also present. while addressing the mediapersons, rinwa said development and peace would be the two main planks on which the party proposed to go to the voters in the coming elections. he said the party proposed to spread its wings further in the state by staking claim to few more assembly seats this time. he said the party had reviewed its position in all the 23 constituencies that had been contested in the 1997 elections while 10 more constituencies had also been identified that it intended to contest in consultation and discussion with sad. referring to the speculations about the possible change of seats by some of the sitting mlas, the state bjp president said as yet there was no such move.he, however, did not discount the possibility of putting up new faces, if needed. justifying the decision to abolish octroi, rinwa said his party could at least boast of fulfilling the promise made during the 1997 elections. on being asked why the government did not take the decision earlier, rinwa said the state of finances in punjab was critical. "" to fill the gap of rs 500-crore loss due to abolition of octroi, the state government had requested the centre for a slab of additional loans till the committee of experts worked out alternative means to generate income,"" he added.

17,Sept 11 set to afflict Indian cotton farmers,"ahmedabad: domestic cotton crop is on its way to becoming another casualty in the market after the attack on the world trade centre on september 11. with cotton consumption in the us plunging by more than 50 lakh bales as an aftermath of the terrorist attack in the us and recession, american cotton growers are increasingly looking at exports to offload their produce; and india has emerged as lucrative market for them. since the cotton supplied by the us growers is priced more than 30 per cent (rs 6,000 per candy) lower than the domestic cotton and is of better quality, american cotton growers are weaning away a huge chunk of the market from the indian cotton growers. all this is deepening the crisis in the domestic cotton market, which started on a weak note this cotton season (october) when cotton prices opened at a much lower level at rs 18,000 per candy compared to last year's rs 22,000 per candy. it has been slipping consistently thereafter. presently, domestic cotton prices are hovering at around rs 14,000 per candy, and the way things stand, it is likely to go down further. even though, we have estimated a higher cotton production this year in comparison to last year, the realisation on cotton crop has been hit because of lower international cotton prices. some countries are selling at as low as 27.4 cent per pound (over rs 10,000 per candy, when converted into rupee), says gujarat state co-operative cotton federation ltd managing director n m sharma. sharma says that the matter is aggravated in a scenario where except for a 5 per cent import duty, there is no quantitative restriction on imports of cotton. the cotton advisory board (cab), which met on thursday has estimated that the cotton production this year would be around 156 lakh bales as against 140 lakh last year. even though they are expecting the closing stock as on september 2002 to be more or less the same as last year at 29 lakh bales, they fear that the domestic cotton growers will be able to offload their stocks in the market only after taking a hit on their returns. according to a cab estimates, america's annual cotton production is expected to be close to 200 lakh bales, and with a slump in the demand, it will have close to 100 lakh at its disposal for exports. uptil now arrival of cotton in the market is around 3 lakh bales while imports have been over 10 lakh bales. major imports into the country are from the us, australia, east european countries, tanzania, sudan and egypt. american farmers are presently offloading their cotton stock in the international at 36 cent per pound as they get a subsidy of around 16 cent per pound (rs 6,160 per candy). ''indian cotton growers do not get any such subsidy. this makes it difficult for them to compete against the cheap imports, says vasudevbhai patel, an ahmedabad-based cotton trader. in all this, textile mills and spinning mills would be the likely gainers as they would be able to procure cotton at a much lower price.
