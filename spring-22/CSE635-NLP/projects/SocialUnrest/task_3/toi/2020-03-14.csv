0,BoM ordered to repay client for flawed recovery,"PUNE: The local debt recovery tribunal (DRT) has directed the Bank of Maharashtra (BoM) to pay Rs 1.33 lakh with eight per cent interest as damages to the bankâ€™s client, Messrs Somji Brothers, for wrongful recovery.

According to the counsels for Somji Brothers, Umeshchandra Kulkarni and Mahesh Patil, India Marine Food Products (IMFPPL), a small-scale enterprise, turned sick in 1975. S.T. Somji of Somji Brothers and others agreed to take over the unit with all its assets and liabilities.

These included a term loan and cash credit facility given by the bank Alleging failure to repay the loan in 1984, the bank filed a suit against Somji Brothers for Rs 12.96 lakh. The case was eventually transferred to the DRT However, Somji contested the bankâ€™s suit and claimed that while restructuring IMFPPLâ€™s loan account, the bank wrongfully clubbed the personal loans of its earlier directors and charged them to the new owners.

Bankâ€™s counsel Ravi Raje argued, â€œSomjiâ€™s claim is time-barred. They should have raised this objection at the time of taking over IMFPPL from its earlier management.â€� However, the tribunal overruled Rajeâ€™s argument. It observed that the bank had failed to bring to the notice of the tribunal records proving that Somji had agreed to pay personal loans of IMFPPLâ€™s old directors.

On the contrary, DRT observed that Somjiâ€™s take-over proposal clearly showed willingness to take over IMFPPL, restricted only to its business assets and liabilities. The tribunal also discovered that, after restructuring of accounts, there was a credit balance of Rs 5.64 lakh on the term-loan account and a debit balance of Rs 4.84 lakh on the cash-credit account in the name of IMFPPL.

DRTâ€™s presiding officer Shrikant Kulkarni further ordered the bank to pay Rs 79,060 with 9.5 per cent interest to Somji Brothers, on account of the balance in credit and term-loan amounts. Raje, however, told TNN, â€œThe bank has already challenged the DRT verdict in the debt recovery appellate tribunal on the ground that the DRT does not have powers to restructure the accounts.â€�

2,"24 hours later, 7.56 pm local hides nervousness","MUMBAI: The women who boarded the first-class compartment of the 7.56 pm Karjat-bound local from CST on Friday betrayed only traces of nervousness at the knowledge that a bomb had gone off on the same train the day before.

Esha Krishnan, a student of Davar''s college of commerce, and a friend had a little discussion on the platform before they finally decided to step aboard the train.

Once they''d bitten the bullet, they began to giggle as they took their cushioned seats. But then they noticed that their usual ""train friends"" were missing.

The local was emptier than usual, but perhaps that was because of the Moharram public holiday. No, Ms Krishnan insisted. Her friends worked for private firms that didn''t have the day off. ""Looks like they didn''t want to take chances,"" she concluded.

Ajita Chandrashekhar, who works with an insurance company, recounted how she had cursed her boss on Thursday for prolonging a meeting. ""I take the 7.56 p.m. Karjat fast everyday,"" the Mulund resident said.

""But, yesterday my boss prolonged the meeting and I missed it. I cursed him for it as I was forced to take the next train. Today, I feel completely indebted to him for saving my life."" At Dadar, 21-year-old Pooja Ruparel stepped in.

The Airoli resident,who gets off at Mulund, said she had been travelling on Thursday''s ill-fated train and was standing on the footboard when the bomb went off.

""For the first time I could tell my folks that hanging out of the door is actually life-saving,"" she recounted, her shyness belying her nerve to step into the ladies compartment the very next day. She escaped with a few bruises and helped two profusely bleeding women to the hospital.

Bhavna Dhedhia boarded the train at Kurla with her hand on the chest, as if to stop her heart from thumping. Asked if she was scared to enter the train, she said, ""You have to hold your heart in your fist when you move around in Mumbai.""

6,"Colour me red, blue, yellow... naturally","NEW DELHI: With Holi round the corner, the city is gearing up for a riotous celebration of colours. But over the years, traditional colours have been replaced by harmful synthetic dyes and powders.

Much of what is available in the market are oxidised metals and industrial dyes. Health experts caution that these colours can cause allergies, temporary blindness, renal failure and even cancer. But thanks to active campaigning by various organisations and the involvement of schoolchildren, the trend is slowly shifting back to using traditional colours.

Many of the colours can be prepared at home. Here is a sampling of just some of the colours one can make with ingredients found in the house or garden.

â€¢ Greens: Mehandi can be mixed with an equal quantity of any flour to get a lovely textured green powder. One should use only pure mehandi and not the variety that comes mixed with amla as this is brown in colour. When mixed with water and made into a paste, this colour can lightly colour the skin. The dry powder can be wiped away easily. Water based colours can be made by mixing a paste of spinach, mint, coriander or hibiscus leaves in water.

â€¢ Reds: Powdered red sandalwood produces a rich earth red where as powdered hibiscus flowers produce a brighter red colour. Flour adds bulk and texture to the powder. Boiling pomegranate peels in water produce a rich red liquid that can be used in pichkaris or water guns. For an orange-red, one can mix chuna (used in the paan) with turmeric powder. This should be made in at least 10 litres of water. Hibiscus flowers can also be soaked overnight to produce a rich red colour. For the less exotic, a mixture of tomato and carrot juice can be used. Adding water can reduce the stickiness.

â€¢ Blues: The flowers of the jacquaranda tree can be dried in the shade and crushed to produce a rich blue powder. Alternatively, the fruits or leaves of the indigo plant can be boiled in water to produce a deep blue dye.

â€¢ Yellows: Two teaspoons of turmeric mixed with double the quantity of gram flour produce a rich yellow powder. Marigold flowers or turmeric soaked in water will also make a deep yellow dye.

â€¢ Magentas: Beetroot soaked in water create a lovely magenta colour. To deepen the hue, the water should be boiled. And for those who believe that black is beautiful and that Holi would be incomplete with out a splash of this classic colour, boil amla in an iron vessel and leave over overnight. Dilute the paste with water.''
