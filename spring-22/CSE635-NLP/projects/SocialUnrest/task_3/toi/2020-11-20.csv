0,India's progress lies in Delhi's development: PM,"NEW DELHI: Indiaâ€™s real progress lies in the development of Delhi, said Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee addressing two political rallies at Chirag Dilli and Raja Garden, in the city on Thursday.

Seeking support for the BJP in the assembly poll, Vajpayee said that speedy development is however possible only if â€˜â€˜there is close coordination between the Centre and states,â€™â€™ hinting that a BJP government in Delhi would do the state good.

The rallies were not heavily attended especially the one in Raja Garden. Heavy security bandobast for the PM was being blamed for the crowds staying away.

â€˜â€˜If the Centre does not get the support of the states, problems cannot be solved. States should work together with the Centre to solve problems and aid development,â€™â€™ he said addressing his first election rally in Chirag Dilli.

He blamed the Congress government for not behaving responsibly as an opposition. â€˜â€˜The Congress should stay in the opposition longer and learn to behave responsibly,â€™â€™ he said. â€˜â€˜The Congress is not a farsighted party, I have been to so many capital cities the world over and Delhi remains surrounded by problems because of the state government here,â€™â€™ he said.

â€˜â€˜The Centre wants to increase support to the states but for working together, it is important that there is understanding between them,â€™â€™ he said.

The PM told the gathering that his party is hopeful of forming a government in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. Vajpayee said he has addressed political rallies there and could see support in BJPâ€™s favour. He also said that the BJP is ready to take responsibility of Delhiâ€™s development.

He took a dig at Sheila Dikshitâ€™s claims of development works when he said that the condition of roads in city is so pathetic that even a truck would break down. The Union governmentâ€™s plan for the highway from Kanyakumari to Kashmir would link all major cities, including Delhi.

The PM said: â€˜â€˜Whenever the BJP has come to power in Delhi, it has resolved local issues.â€™â€™ Countering the charge of Congress president Sonia Gandhi on the employment front, Vajpayee said: â€˜â€˜Our government has created employment opportunities of more than one crore per year.â€™â€™

1,"Violence mars Bihar bypolls, UP peaceful","NEW DELHI: Naxalites gunned down two polling personnel as sporadic violence marred assembly bypolls in three constitu-encies in Bihar where an estimated 48 per cent of the electorate cast votes while byelections to two seats in UP passed off peacefully.

Two members of a polling party were shot dead and as many police constables went missing when the MCC naxalites, which gave a poll boycott call, attacked them soon after the bypoll for Barachatti assembly seat in Gaya district of Bihar was over.

Unconfirmed reports said three polling officers were killed and five constables were missing after the incident.

The exercise in two other constituencies of Sitamarhi and Fatuha was, however, by and large peaceful with around 50 to 55 per cent voter turnout.

In Uttar Pradesh, bypoll to Harora assembly seat, vacated by BSP supremo and former chief minister Mayawati, drew 67 per cent turnout of voters and an estimated 57 per cent of voters exercised their franchise in Mahasi where byelections were forced by the death of BSP MLA Ali Bhadur.

2,75 pc turnout in Mizoram polls,"NEW DELHI/AIZAWL: An estimated 75 per cent voters exercised their franchise in Mizoram assembly polls on Thursday, the Election Commission said.

Barring stray incidents of intimidation of voters, polling passed off peacefully, amid tight security. Former chief minister and state Congress chief Lalthanhawla and governor A R Kohli were among the early ones to cast their votes.

Long queues were seen in front of polling stations as polling began at 7 am. People waited patiently for their turn to cast votes through electronic voting machines (EVMs), being used in the state for the first time.

Women formed majority of early-morning voters.

Out of 798 polling stations spread over eight districts, 57 were declared sensitive where additional armed police were deployed, officials said.

In seven out of 12 polling stations in Suangpuilawn constituency, where countermanding of polling was demanded by three candidates set free by abductors Thursday morning, no votes were cast till 11 am. The remaining five polling stations saw only a few people turning up for voting.

3,SAD as a political party may perish: Wadala,"JALANDHAR: The very existence of the Akali Dal as a political party is threatened with the leadership having got centred around just one person and that same person is getting more and more entangled in the anti-corruption drive launched by the Amarinder Singh government.

These were the views of Kuldeep Singh, once in the top rung of the Akali leadership of the state, but who later fell out with Badal and formed his party, the Akali Dal Democratic.

Elaborating further, he said this was a fight for political survival and the Congress would fight it to the end. If CM Amarinder Singh does not take the drive against corruption to its logical conclusion then he would be finished.

Under the patronage of the Akal Takht Jathedar the various factions of the Akali Dal can once again come together, he said. The jathedar has to take the initiative for that. â€œWe do not have any trust in the unifying move made by Parkash Singh Badal or even Ravi Inder Singh. Even Simranjit Singh Mann is suspect. All of these leaders are ambitious. They are all candidates for the chief ministership.

They bargain for unity keeping that ambition and demand in mind. We are the only group that is not hungry for power. The game of dividing the Akali Dal is being masterminded by Amarinder Singh.

Otherwise, how come both Simranjit Singh Mann and Ravi Inder Singh have a word of praise for his action against the Badals,â€� said Wadala.He said by this division we are only strengthening the Congress in Punjab.

Harping on his favourite subject, the control of Sikh gurdwaras Pakistan and the indifference being shown by the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre, he said it appeared to be a conspiracy against the Sikh community.

While the Pakistan government was willing to grant an open corridor to the Kartarpur Sahib gurdwara, the Centre had not responded to our letters sent at least 10 times.

The Centre, he said, was not being fair to the community that made supreme sacrifices first against the Moghuls and then in the successive wars against China and Pakistan. In the freedom struggle, too, the community was in the forefront.

4,My govt will complete full term: Krishna,"BANGALORE: Ruling out early assembly polls in Karnataka, chief minister S.M. Krishna on Thursday said the Congress government intended to complete the five-year term.

â€œPeople of the state have given us a five-year mandate and we intend to honour it. We should set aside speculation,â€™â€™ he told reporters here.

When his attention was drawn to Andhra CM Chandrababu Naiduâ€™s decision to dissolve the Assembly, he said: â€œThere is no written rule that elections to the assembly and Parliament should be held simultaneously.â€™â€™

Naxalites: Krishna said the government did not favour any joint task force to tackle the Naxal problem. â€œWe have initiated certain measures and the government feels they are adequate.â€™â€™

SC decision: On the Supreme Court transferring two disproportionate assets cases against Tamil Nadu chief minister J. Jayalalithaa to a special court in Bangalore, Krishna said he was yet to go through the order in detail.

â€œThe government will hold discussions with the state advocate-general and law secretary in this regard. We will abide by the court order,â€™â€™ he said.

5,150 taluks drought hit; state govt to seek funds,"BANGALORE: With 150 taluks declared drought-hit, Karnataka is preparing its third memorandum on drought this year, requesting central assistance.

Information minister Allum Veerabhadrappa told reporters here after a cabinet meeting on Thursday: â€œThe North-East monsoon has failed, there has been large-scale loss of rabi crop over the last 45 days.

â€œWe will send the memorandum by month-end, by which time some more taluks will be declared drought-hit,â€™â€™ he said.

A directive will be sent to all deputy commissioners that water in tanks and lakes should not be used for agriculture purposes.

â€œIt should be used only for drinking and for animals till further notice,â€™â€™ Allum said.

On rains from cloud-seeding, for which the state has spent an estimated Rs 7 crore, Allum said: â€œWe should have started it in June, when there were clouds, but it was delayed till August.

â€œThere have been two good rains since then, but we donâ€™t know if it was because of cloud-seeding or nature.â€™â€™

APMC amendment: The cabinet has decided to amend the APMC Act to restrict the 1.5 per cent cess to one point. Presently, cess is being paid by both the farmer and the trader.

Allum Veerabhadrappa said this would mean a loss of about Rs 10 crore for the exchequer.

On the proposal to accommodate multi-national Metro and permit private players to sell 123 agro-products protected under the Act, he said: â€œThis was not discussed.â€™â€™

6,JD(S) leader hits back on ministers,"MYSORE: District Janata Dal(S) president G.T. Devegowda on Thursday hit back at the statement made by three district ministers and said, the ministers should know how secular their party is before dubbing JD(S) â€œcasteistâ€�.

Pointing to the amicable settlement of the Hubli Idga Maidan issue, Devegowda challenged the ministers to quote an incident where Congress party or its leadership had shown an exemplary mind to resolve a communal crisis. Accusing Congress and BJP of being communal, he said, while one was responsible for Godhra the other was responsible for the 1984 Sikh riots.

â€œThere is nothing wrong in Chidananda contesting the elections,â€™â€™ he added.

Asked about the allegations made by rebel JD(S) candidate and sitting MLC Y. Mahesh against party leaders, Devegowda dubbed Maheshâ€™s remarks as an â€œoutburst of a frustrated man in politicsâ€™â€™.

7,Heavy turnout in bypolls,"LUCKNOW/BAHRAICH: Harora (Saharanpur) and Mahsi (Behraich), the two assembly constituencies which went to polls on Thursday, recorded a heavy turnout.

According to a state election commission spokesman, Harora recorded 65 per cent polling while 57 per cent voters had turned in Mahsi to cast their votes during the by-polls on the two seats on Thursday.

â€œPolling was by and large peaceful and incident-free. Therefore, there would be no re-polls,â€� stated a state election commission spokesman.

Represented by the former chief minister Mayawati, Jagpal is BSPâ€™s nominee in Harora. The Mahsi assembly seat in Behraich district had fallen vacant following the death of BSP MLA Ali Bahadur. The BSP had fielded Jamial Khataun, the widow of Ali Bahadur.

The prestige of both Mayawati and chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav is sealed into ballot boxes as both the political rivals had put in all their might to ensure victories of their candidate.

The counting of votes would take place on December 2. The result in Harora, represented by Mayawati, becomes all the more important as it would be a test of BSPâ€™s popularity graph, which nosedived following her alleged involvement into the Rs 175 crore Taj Heritage Corridor scam. Reverses in by-polls may cast a shadow not only on BSP prospects in elections in other states but also would be indicative of Mayawati losing hold over BSPâ€™s cadre.

Meanehile, BJP spokersperson Hridaynaran Dixit alleged that a former MLA and district president of the SP, Ram Tej Yadav entered the polling area and intimidated the voters at the Aarohi polling station of the Mahsi constituency. Dixit said that while Yadav had intimidated voters the police and officials present at Lalpur Shivpur booths had forced BJP agents to leave the polling area.

8,Minister blames state govt for non-cooperation,"RANCHI: The state government has been accused of not cooperating with the Centre in establishing the Khadi Board in the state, even after three years of its creation.

This was alleged by Union minister of state for agriculture and gram udyog, Sanghmitra Gautam, on Thursday.

Gautam was in the state to attend a workshop of artisans at Bishunpur, in Gumla. While addressing newsmen he blamed the state government for its lackadaisical attitude.

He said that though both in the Centre and the state the government is of NDA, yet Jharkhand is lagging behind.

â€œIf one brother extends his hand, but the other does not cooperate, how is development possibleâ€�? he asked.

9,"Assam, Bihar govts asked to end violence: Swami","RANCHI: â€œThe Centre has directed both the state governments of Assam and Bihar to put an end to the continuing spate of violence in the two statesâ€�, said Union minister of state for home ID Swami on Thursday.

Describing the incidents of violence in the states on petty recruitment issues as tragic, Swami said that while Deputy Prime Minister has spoken to the chief ministers of both the states, the home secretary is in continuous touch with the chief secretaries and administrative machinery in the two states. Swami, who is here on a personal visit was addressing a press conference.

The Centre has already sent paramilitary forces to Assam. Besides, people are also being asked to be tolerant, he said adding, if the Assam government effectively uses the existing forces and state police personnel judiciously, the situation would be in control soon.

Commenting on the recent Dilip Singh Judeo incident, Swami said that BJP has once again proved that nothing can erode the credibility of the party.While the Prime Minister has ordered a CBI inquiry into the incident, Judeo has tendered his resignation.

â€œBut our stand is firm. We believe that a conspiracy has been hatched against Judeoâ€�, said Swami. Though, Swami denied that the BJP ever projected Judeo as chief ministerial candidate, he maintained that he (Judeo) would be the star campaigner in the coming polls.

Reflecting upon the controversy over simultaneous polls, Swami said that the issue is still being considered and a consensus has to be evolved before the idea could be translated into quality.

However, such a system would be of great help in cutting down expenses and saving time, he said.

10,TRS deplores govt order on sluices,"HYDERABAD: Taking exception to the government hurriedly issuing a government order for the closure of the Rajolibanda Diversion Scheme (RDS) sluices on Wednesday, the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) criticised the move as a â€˜pre-poll gimmickâ€™ aimed at deceiving the people of Telangana.

â€œThe government failed to respond to the demand for closure of the RDS sluices even after several agitations. Now with elections nearing, chief minister Chandrababu Naidu had ordered the closure of the sluices,â€� TRS president K Chandrasekhar Rao told reporters on Thursday.

The government on Wednesday issued a GO ordering fitting of shutters to the sluices. However, the TRS felt that the sluices should be closed completely and the height of the reverse sluices (for letting out flood waters) should be increased as recommended by a high-power committee recently.

The GO assumes significance as the TRS has planned to organise the â€˜Palamur Prajagarjanaâ€™ (public meeting) at Palamur on Friday deploring the diversion of water to the Kurnool-Cuddapah canal by keeping open the RDS sluices.

Similarly, the government had called for tenders to take up the Kalwakurthy Lift Irrigation Project despite the fact that it has no water and budgetary allocations. This shows that the TDP wants to once again deceive the people of Telangana by their â€˜cheap political gimmicks,â€™ the TRS president said.

Lashing out at the number of GOs issued and the ordering of transfers after the dissolution of the assembly, Chandrasekhar Rao said that they would complain to the Election Commission about the â€˜abuse and misuseâ€™ of power in the state.

Condemning Naiduâ€™s policy on naxalites issue, he said the approach of the chief minister would lead to bloodshed in the state. â€œThe chief minister is trying to regain power by risking the lives of his own partyâ€™s rank and file,â€� he said reacting to Naiduâ€™s call for TDP cadre to fight against the naxalites.

On the issue of TDPâ€™s commitment for an unified Andhra, he said that Naidu has no moral right to talk on the issue. Naidu led the â€˜Jai Andhraâ€™ movement for separate Andhra and was also jailed at the Tirupati police station, he pointed out.

11,City to get Krishna waters before polls,"HYDERABAD: With the dates for the state assembly elections yet to be decided by the Election Commission, the government is all out to push for completion of Krishna Water Supply Project much ahead of the scheduled March 31, 2004.

The government hopes to supply Krishna water much before the elections are held and turn it into votes. To ensure that the present government keeps up its promises, tourism minister T Srinivas Yadav reviewed the ongoing works of Krishna project with the Hyderabad Metro Water Supply and Sewerage Board on Thursday.

The minister asked the officials to bring to notice any problem like land acquisition or even naxalites trying to disrupt the project. The cabinet has formed a special committee to deal with the land acquisition problem that cropped up at Ibrahimpatnam where the farmers demanded more compensation to give up their land.

Later addressing reporters, Srinivas Yadav said already 60 per cent of the work on the stage-I of the phase-I of the project to transmit 45 million gallons a day Krishna water has been completed.

12,"Two die in poll violence, two cops missing","PATNA: The by-election to three assembly seats in Bihar turned violent on Thursday when a presiding officer and a polling officer were shot dead by suspected members of the Naxalite outfit MCC in the Barachatti assembly constituency.

The officials were returning from the Barki Chaki polling station after the elections when they were intercepted in the Bhalua forest under Mohanpur police station by the Naxalites and shot.

Two constables accompanying them were untraceable and the police suspect that they were taken away by the MCC men.

The elections in Fatuha and Sitamarhi constituencies were, however, by and large peaceful. The average voting in the three assembly constituencies was 53 per cent. The Fatuha constituency witnessed 56 per cent polling, Sitamarhi 52 while Barachatti 51.

Barki Chaki village situated on the border of Hazaribag (Jharkhand) is not easily accessible and not motorable.

The people reach this village on foot, said the IG (headquarters), Neelmani.The presiding officer killed has been identified as Butan Singh. He was an accountant in the Rural Engineering Organisation (REO).

The MCC had given a call for the boycott of the bypolls.

At Sitamarhi, Indian Federal Democratic Party leader and MP, Anwarul Haq, was arrested when he tried to disrupt the poll process in one of the booths in the morning. His 18 supporters were also nabbed.

In another incident two persons were arrested by the police for carrying two countrymade pistols and 18 cartridges during poll hours about 200 yards from a booth at Sonmai village of the Fatuha constituency.

13,"A foggy view for govt, airlines","NEW DELHI: It''s that time of the year again. With winter creeping in, airlines and passengers are again staring at fog-related flight delays and long waits at airports.

And the Airports Authority of India (AAI) is busy penning route diversions for airlines rather than finding a permanent solution for this annual problem.

While AAI has gone to town praising its new generation CAT-IIIa flight landing assistance system deployed at the IGI airport in Delhi, experts feel itâ€™s yet another case of precious public money wasted.

Even as the system was in place last year, the fog forced airlines to reschedule their landings in Delhi and divert flights to other centres on 36 days. â€˜â€˜On an average, five flights a day had to be rescheduled last year,â€™â€™ an AAI official said.

Experts say poor deployment of systems is to blame. â€˜â€˜IGI has four approach landings, but the CAT-IIIa system is deployed on only one of these four approaches,â€™â€™ says a pilot with one of the private domestic carriers.

No wonder only 16-odd international airlines (of the 35 plus airlines that fly into the country) were able to use the CAT-IIIa system last winter for landing in Delhi. And, Indian Airlines is the only domestic carrier to have trained and certified 12 of its over 400 pilots to use this system.

Airlines, insiders say, are skeptical as the cost involved in training and certifying pilots is far higher than accommodating passengers in a smaller centre for a night and burning a few extra litres of fuel.

The fact that Delhi is the only airport in the country with a CAT-IIIa system is also making the whole proposition cost ineffective. â€˜â€˜There are almost 20 airports in the country that are affected by the fog problem every winter. It does not make any sense to get all our pilots certified for just one landing strip in Delhi,â€™â€™ says another airline executive.

Besides, not all aircraft in the country are compatible with the system.

14,US govt okays fine for MFs,"WASHINGTON: The US House of Representatives has moved quickly to adopt legislation cracking down on mutual fund abuses and providing more information for investors.

However, lawmakers of both parties agree that substantial work is needed before a final reform measure can be enacted. Even the principal author of the House measure, Richard Baker, said further changes were needed for Congress to send President Bush â€œthe strongest possible reform Billâ€�.

The Houseâ€™s 418-2 vote on Wednesday came as industry problems spread, with more big-name companies cited for allowing special trading deals that disadvantage ordinary investors and a money stampede continuing out of tainted funds. Lawmakers approved the measure after a brief debate.

The legislation will impose penalties against fund trading abuses, make directors on company boards more independent from fund managers and require companies to disclose more information to investors about fees and fund operations.

It still needs approval in the Senate, where several different versions have been proposed. No action is expected before next year.

Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan and treasury secretary John Snow have cautioned Congress against passing mutual fund reforms that could cost investors more in fees and diminished returns.

The White House said the Bill â€œhighlights key areas of reformâ€� that the SEC chief has said will be addressed. The Bush administration pledged to work with Congress on â€œprudent steps to protectâ€� mutual fund investors.

Many of the Billâ€™s provisions direct the SEC to make changes, notably regarding disclosure of fund fees and other information.

The House acted ahead of the SEC, which plans to make changes in how fund companies govern themselves through new rules it will consider in coming months.

Among the proposed SEC changes is a requirement that board chairmen of fund companies be wholly independent from the companies managing the funds, a reversal of the agencyâ€™s previous position.

15,Sonia did not use copter for polls: Cong,"NEW DELHI: The Congress admitted on Thursday that party president Sonia Gandhi had used a Chhattisgarh government helicopter, but said it had not been used for campaigning and, therefore, it did not amount to a violation of the model code of conduct in force for assembly polls in five states.

Replying to the Election Commissionâ€™s notice on the â€˜â€˜violationâ€™â€™ of the code by Sonia Gandhi, chief minister Ajit Jogi and Madhya Pradesh speaker Sriniwas Tiwari, the party said she had used the helicopter to fly from Chennai to Sriperumbudur on October 10 to attend a â€˜â€˜solemn function in which President Abdul Kalam dedicated a memorial to the nation in honour of Rajiv Gandhiâ€™â€™.

This comes in the wake of the ECâ€™s notice to the Congress on Monday, asking why it should not be derecognised for using a Chhattisgarh government aircraft and a helicopter in violation of the model code in force in five states, and seeking an explantion within seven days.

Party spokesperson Anand Sharma said the party had asked the state government about the use by Jogi and Tiwari of the aircraft and the circumstances under which they were used. The reply would be sent within the stipulated period, he said.

Sharma said that the helicopter had been used keeping in mind Soniaâ€™s security considerations and added that her mode of travel was always determined by the SPG which provided security cover to her.

16,"Uneasy calm in Assam, no violence overnight","GUWAHATI: An uneasy calm prevailed in Assam with no major incident of violence reported overnight and curfew in worst-hit Tinsukia being relaxed for two hours.

The curfew is being relaxed from 11.30 am for two hours, official sources said, adding the fear of reprisal stalked residents of Tinsukia, Dibrugarh, Dhubri, Bongaigaon and Nalbari, causing tension to prevail.

Sporadic attempts were also made by unidentified persons to set on fire abandoned Bihari huts, besides intimidation to extort money, the sources said.

Describing improvement in situation as ""marginal"", the sources said prohibitory orders were being relaxed in Tinsukia to allow people to buy essential commodities.

The curfew in Tinsukia and Dibrugarh districts has hit train services also. The districts have thick Bihari population with many of them opting to leave the state and making a beeline for the railway station, the sources added.

17,Cabinet may review buffer stock policy,"NEW DELHI: The food ministry expects to approach the Cabinet shortly to review the countryâ€™s buffer stock policy.

Caught between the devil of shortage and the deep blue sea of plenty, it remains to be seen how the Cabinet will play it. Will it play safe in an electoral year and merely tinker with the norms for wheat and rice and open-ended procurement policy?

Or will it partly jettison what has been seen as a comforting cushion against droughts and instability in prices â€” and a support line for the farmer.

Open-ended procurement is extracting a heavy cost, with the annual subsidy bill at a staggering Rs 27,000 cr. Export subsidy in 2002-03 on wheat and rice was more than Rs 5,000 cr.

Buffer stock norms, framed every five years, are calculated on the requirements of the public distribution system (PDS) and welfare schemes and the need for stabilisation in case of contingencies. Linked to this is a logistics requirement of minimum inventory and some cushioning. But procurement beyond this requirement is usual.

Given the seasonality of agriculture, the buffer depends on the cycle and procurement but the norms are different for every quarter â€” January, April, July and October. Taken together, July would yield 243 lakh tonnes â€” 100 lakh tonnes of rice and 143 lakh tonnes of wheat.

In June last, stocks rose to a staggering, and draining, 640 lakh tonnes. Drought and exports have brought this down to manageable levels but obviously, changing equations are providing greater room for manoeuvrability. Excess stocks in the late 1990s, for instance, diversification of the food basket, export of these two crops since 2000, the decision now to allow futures trading in wheat and rice. Unstated is the cushion of comfortable foreign exchange reserves.

About a year ago, the government asked Delhi Universityâ€™s Agricultural Economics Research Centre to study the norms. This report is now in, amid debate within the ministry that huge stocks are not just a drain economically but a whipping boy politically for anyone wanting to take potshots at the government.

One view is that the government could rely entirely on domestic procurement for building the annual buffer stock for PDS and welfare schemes â€” 100 lakh tonnes of rice and 60 lakh tonnes of wheat. But buffer for stabilisation, this view holds, could be managed partly through domestic procurement and partly through purchase from the international market.

The second view is against any reliance on imports for a cushion and believes the only possible tinkering with norms could be marginal variations decided by the schedule of arrivals, past experience and production variations.

18,State projects itself as most investment-friendly,"NEW DELHI: Gujarat on Friday set an ambitious target of 15 per cent annual economic growth rate and said it offered the most investment-friendly climate in the country.

â€œThe Gujarat government has set up a Task Force on Investment under the chief secretary after the great success of the recently-held Gujarat Investment Summit where MoUs worth Rs 66,000 crore were signed,â€� Chief Minister Narendra Modi said after a closed door meeting with US India Business Council here.

â€œWe had a very frank and open discussion on opportunities in the state and I hope there would be a very good collaboration between the Gujarat government and USIBC,â€� Rajat Gupta of McKinsey and Co. said.

About the effect of incidence of violence in the state on investment climate, Gupta said, â€œThere was a frank exchange of views with the chief minister on all issues of concern.â€�

CII secretary-general Tarun Das said the target of 15 per cent annual growth rate for Gujarat was achievable and the investors have shown a very positive attitude towards investing in the state.

Modi said there was no fear among investors as evident by the response to the Gujarat Summit in which delegations from 40 countries participated.

On Wipro Chief Azim Premji deciding not to invest due to communal violence in the state and its proximity to Pakistan, Modi said though Premji hailed from Gujarat, he had made no substantial investment there after settling down in Bangalore.

19,Action Aid announces incentives for donors,"AHMEDABAD: When people do good, they should get good things in return. Guided by this philosophy, Action Aid India on Friday launched, â€˜Karma Mitra--Friends in actionâ€™, a first of its kind donor loyalty programme, where the donor and the recipient stand to benefit.

While the beneficiaries who are marginalised and impoverished benefit from the programme as their needs would be met with the help of donations, the donor would benefit by getting returns in the form of tax rebates, free music CDs, free invites to music concerts.

Super theatre, life insurance, credit cards and holiday packages. Of the total amount of the donation, 50 per cent will be used for community development activities and 50 per cent will be reinvested for the donorâ€™s benefit.

The AAI Society has signed MoUs with ICICI Bank, Om Kotak Mahindra, Heritage Hotels and Reliance Infocom to provide benefits to the donors. Karma Mitra is also being encouraged by Times Foundation.

â€œOur work is driven by the principle of â€˜philanthropy for social justiceâ€™ wherein we go beyond just giving money to actually involving ourselves with issues that are fundamental for ensuring the rights of the poor and marginalised towards social justice and equality,â€� said AAI country director Harsh Mander.

In a 20-minute audio-visual presentation, the AAI showed how the organisation helped various socially unempowered strata of the society, including the urban homeless, manual scavengers, tribals, sex workers, Dalits, riot victims, street children and HIV positive persons.

While elucidating the various challenges posed to the diverse fabric of our nation, he said: â€œWhat happened in Gujarat in 2002 has been the most serious challenge to the notion of equality guaranteed by the Constitution. It was a planned subversion and injustice perpetrated against the minorities.â€™ He said the Supreme Courtâ€™s recent order to stay further hearing on the 10 major cases identified by the NHRC is a severe indictment of the constitutional machinery in Gujarat.

â€œOur partner in Gujarat, Aman Samuday, is providing legal aid to the victims of the post-Godhra riots. Incidentally, of the 240 Pota arrests made, 239 persons are Muslims. More than 2,000 cases of victims have been closed without giving them a trial,â€� he added.

20,States going to polls swamped with Modi posters,"AHMEDABAD: Narendra Modi is not the only export of the ruling BJP in Gujarat to the four states going to polls shortly.

Posters and banners, most of them carrying the image of the chief minister, left over from last Decemberâ€™s Assembly polls in the state have been sent to MP, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Delhi.

The ruling BJP has provided a huge stock of election material portraying star campaigner Narendra Modi, who is currently on a whistle-stop visit to the four states.

â€œThe party has not given any funds to these states, as funds have to be generated by each state,â€� asserted a senior party functionary.

Reliable sources in the BJP said some of the material and literature are available here at reasonable rates, and therefore the party has accepted this responsibility and has been transporting the literature and other things to the respective party units for the last few days.

â€œThe state unit has sent several packages, containing election material, to at least 600 assembly constituencies in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. The total cost of printed literature and saffron flags must be around Rs 50 lakh.â€�

When contacted, state BJP treasurer Surendra Patel admitted that the literature has been published and sent to these four states, but he stoutly denied that any funds were given for Assembly elections in the four states.

Pleading ignorance over election funds, senior BJP leaders Jayantilal Barot and Sunil Singhi â€” who have been assigned the election duty in Mewar and Marwad areas of Rajasthan â€” quipped, â€œMore than 2,000 state party workers, who have gone to Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh for canvassing, have carried the election material with them.â€�

State BJP president Rajendrasinh Rana also denied any funds being collected from the state for the four states. Rana, too, has been allotted some of the constituencies, including Udaipur, for campaigning.

â€œIn fact, the BJP is passing through a bad phase with regard to finances ever since Modi has taken over as chief minister, and has to pull on with whatever the party had in the last December elections,â€� a party source said.

21,Curfew in Parbhani as mobs clash,"MUMBAI: At least 34 people were injured, three of them critically, after two motorcycle-borne youths hurled crude bombs outside a place of worship in Parbhani city in the Marathwada region of the state on Friday afternoon.

Curfew was imposed at about 6 p.m. and police rushed in additional forces. Deputy CM Chhagan Bhujbal directed state police chief S M Shangari to rush to the spot and take measures to contain the situation.

Minister of state for home Kripashanker Singh said the situation was under control. The blast occurred at about 1.50 p.m. when a group of worshippers was dispersing after Friday prayers in north Parbhani, close to Dhar Road.

Immediately after the blast, riots erupted in the Gandhi Park and Shivaji Chowk areas, with armed mobs burning shops and torching vehicles, eyewitnesses told TNN.

Stonepelting was also reported in nearby towns, including Pathri, Manvat and Selu. Two State Reserve Police Force companies were deployed in these towns.

Although a few people were detained by the local police, senior officers declined to provide details about the detentions.

No arrests had been made until Friday night and the motive for the attack was also not clear, an officer said.

Bhujbal said the riots in Parbhani were primarily because of â€œwild rumoursâ€™â€™ that many people had died in the blast.

Meanwhile, Mumbai joint police commissioner (law and order) Javed Ahmed said he had asked officers at 83 police stations in the metropolis to be on alert and ensure that there was no flare-up in the wake of the Parbhani incident.

The officers will interact with members of the local mohalla committees.

22,Govt learns a competition rule the hard way,"NEW DELHI: The Centre on Friday bowed to the Supreme Court''s mandate to delete a controversial provision in the Competition Commission Act, which makes the high courts the executing authority of the commission headed by a retired bureaucrat.

The governmentâ€™s assurance came after a Bench of Chief Justice V N Khare and Justice S B Sinha indicted the Centre for the provision which makes the HCs subordinate to the commission.

The court, which had on October 31 said the commissionâ€™s constitution was aimed at bypassing the judiciary, asked attorney-general Soli J Sorabjee to â€˜â€˜scrapâ€™â€™ section 39 of the Act.

â€˜â€˜We expected that it will be scrapped before we took up further hearing of the petition challenging the appointment of a bureaucrat to head the commission.â€™â€™

Sorabjee gave an undertaking that the objectionable provision would be deleted. The hearing of the petition â€” filed by lawyer Brahm Dutt â€” challenging the appointment of a bureaucrat as head of the commission has been fixed for December 16.

Duttâ€™s counsel R K Jain said the government was saying something in the affidavit and telling something else to the court.

At the outset, the Bench said that every Act has to be seen in the light of the Constitution.
