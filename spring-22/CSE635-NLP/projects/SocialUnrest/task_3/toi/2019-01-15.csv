0,Congress focuses on LS polls,"new delhi: even as the congress central election committee is finalising candidates for the uttar pradesh assembly polls, the general message being sent out to the cadres is ''this opportunity be used to position the congress as a ruling party for the next lok sabha poll''. the party's strategy is to highlight the fact that the congress is the ruling party in as many as 11 states, and contrast their chief ministers' track record with those of the opposition-ruled states. the effort is to project the congress as the only party capable of running an effective administration and focus on the failures of the rajnath singh ministry. the congress leadership is well aware that the party is not in the race of the top slot in the electorally-crucial up in next month's assembly poll, but it feels that the party should work towards improving on past performance so that it emerges as a key player in the next lok sabha elections. party leaders said the effort is not just to win more seats but also to improve its vote share, which had dipped to a dismal 8 per cent in the last assembly election. congress leaders have, therefore, asked their workers to lead from the front, speak confidently and reach out to all sections of society. with the congress having lost its traditional vote base of the scheduled castes to the bahujan samaj party (bsp), minorities to the samajwadi party (sp) and the upper castes to the bjp, the workers have been told to work hard and woo all sections. ''no section of society is really a stranger to the congress ...we should try to win them over, including those who have not supported us in the past,'' is the message for the up elections. the fact that the congress has 11 state governments is to be used as the party's usp, particularly in up polls. this will form the thrust of the congress election campaign.

""since the proposal failed to materialise, the msrtc officials are now putting pressure on the government to drive the private operators out of the fray,"" he alleged. in a memorandum submitted to the rto and the rta, shinde pointed out that private transporters were depositing a regular tax of rs 1.65 lakh per bus. ""the state government earns a revenue of rs 150 crore from private bus owners,"" he added. significantly, shinde also reminded the authorities of their unfulfilled assurance of constructing a central depot and four pickup points for private bus operators. despite the series of allegations and protests, the rto has clearly said that the drive against private operators would continue in accordance with the high court ruling.

4,"Cong will win civic polls, claims Kalmadi","pune: the rebellion in the congress city unit over the selection of the party candidates for the forthcoming civic polls has been nipped in the bud, rajya sabha member suresh kalmadi claimed here at a press conference on monday. he said that barring a few exceptions, a majority of the rebel congressmen have already withdrawn their nominations. according to the pmc's election office, as many as 397 candidates of the total 1,290 withdrew from the fray on monday, the last day for withdrawals. the final list of the 893 candidates will be published on january 16. some of the congress rebel candidates who have withdrawn their nominations include b.d. bhujbal, suresh dharmavat, pradeep gupta, rajendra bhutada, ravi chaudhari, raja pasalkar, aziz sayyed and yashwant mahindrakar. kalmadi said he was hopeful that the party will be able to win a two-thirds majority in the 146-member house and thus retain the hold over the pmc for the third consecutive term. meanwhile, three muslim candidates from the congress have been disqualified owing to flaws in their nomination papers. there is a growing unrest among the muslims that the congress has meted out injustice to them by nominating just six members from the community. the pune city young muslim committee had, in fact, issued a press statement warning that the committee would appeal to the community members to voice their protest against the congress. speaking on this development, kalmadi said he has appointed p.a. inamdar, a trustee of several minority community educational institutes, as the congress election campaign chief in pune. refuting the possibility of a divide in the traditional congress vote bank following the ascendancy of the nationalist congress party (ncp), kalmadi said the ncp was a spent force in pune.

5,"Sugar exporters cheating govt, alleges Sena MLC","pune: claiming it to be a rs 60-crore plus scam, shiv sena mlc kanhaiyalal gidwani has alleged that sugar exporters in the state have been inflicting heavy losses on the government and the sugar mills by clandestinely selling sugar in the domestic market. addressing a press conference here on monday, gidwani said sugar exporters in maharashtra have been evading excise duty and selling cheap sugar meant for exports in the domestic market. ""the rates of export sugar is set at rs 1,050 per quintal while the one for domestic market is rs 1,250, excluding excise duty. the exporters are diverting sugar to the domestic market because of the price difference,"" he alleged. gidwani said the exporters not only save rs 200 per quintal in the basic price under the export quota but also avoid payment of excise duty of rs 85 applicable to the domestic market. thus, the exporters make a killing of rs 285 per quintal by diverting sugar meant for exports to the domestic market, he added. elaborating on the modus operandi, gidwani said the exporters get their sugar deliberately rejected by the inspection agents at the ports. the inspection agent, hand-in-glove with the exporters, rejects the sugar for dispatch to a foreign destination on the grounds that it does not match specifications. once the sugar is rejected for exports, it is then diverted to the open market within india for freesale, he alleged. the sena legislator, who met the sugar commissioner and the central excise commissioner in pune on monday, has demanded that an inquiry be conducted to stop the loot of the exchequer and losses to sugar mills. he said the sugar commissioner has assured him that all sugar mills in the state would be asked to submit detailed records of the goods sold by them.

6,MPCB enforces bio-medical waste rules,"pune: with a view to ensure complete disposal of hospital waste, the maharashtra pollution control board (mpcb) has made it mandatory for all the 141 hospitals in the pimpri-chinchwad municipal corporation (pcmc) limits to adhere to the bio-medical waste (bmw) rules of 1998 from this year. under the new guidelines issued by the mpcb, the hospitals will have to register with the board via pcmc by paying an additional amount of rs 2,500. for the last five years, the hospitals have been paying rs 1,000 each per year to the pcmc under the bombay nursing homes registration (bnhr) act of 1949. the pcmc, in turn, provides them with an incinerator facility for disposal of waste. pcmc's chief medical officer k. nagkumar and medical director r.r. iyer said the incinerator at the yashwantrao chavan memorial hospital in pimpri had a capacity of destroying around 75 kg of hospital waste per hour.

7,PMC mulls holding polls in all panels,"pune: the pune municipal corporation (pmc) is contemplating elections in all the 48 panels according to schedule on february 10, provided the bombay high court does not insist on the redemarcation of the 10 panels in which elections have been stayed. the high court on january 10 directed the pmc not to hold elections in the 10 panels which comprise the area of the 20 villages that have been partly or fully de-linked from the pmc. the court had ruled that the pmc should first delete the area of the de-linked villages from these 10 panels and then conduct the civic polls, on or before march 14, for the areas that remain in its jurisdiction. according to highly placed sources, the pmc has already prepared maps of these 10 panels and can identify the area that remains in the pmc's jurisdiction after deleting the areas of the villages. elaborating, a senior civic officer pointed out that if the de-linked villages like mhalunge and sus were deleted from panel number 1 (mhalunge-aundh) the boundaries of the areas that remain with the pmc can be easily worked out with the help of the maps. the only problem will be that the aundh panel will have less number of voters as compared with the other 38 panels in the city. ""if the high court does not insist on maintaining a minimum population in each panel then the pmc can hold the elections in aundh and the remaining nine panels on february 10 itself. there will be no need to wait till march."" if the proposal works out then the election process conducted so far in these 10 panels will be considered valid and the pmc will not even need to call for fresh nominations. it may be noted here that the high court order to stay the election process in these 10 panels had come on the last day of filing nominations. interestingly, as the copy of the high court order has not yet reached the pmc, the civic election office on monday accepted the withdrawals from the candidates from these 10 panels. the state election commission on monday issued a letter to the pmc asking it to stop the process of allotting symbols to candidates from these 10 panels. when this was pointed out, the officer said the work of allotting symbols can be finished in a day after the hc clears the proposal. according to the rules, every candidate contesting the civic polls must be a resident of the pmc. asked about the fate of candidates hailing from the de-linked villages, the officer said, ""in that case we will cancel their nominations and conduct the elections between those who are pmc residents.""

9,Contractors fret over fate after MCH polls,"hyderabad: even as campaigning reaches its peak and citizens look forward to a mayor who would be fair and help improve the civic conditions of the city, the 1000-odd contractors at the municipal corporation of hyderabad (mch) are said to be worried about their fate after the elected body takes charge. the mch contractors claim that after the mayor and the corporators are elected, the contractors who on an average get one contract a year, would not be able to get even that. the argument of the contractors is that a corporator would spend anywhere between rs 3 to 4 lakh to get elected as a councillor. the elected representative would make all efforts to get back the money spent during the election campaign mainly by giving contracts to men of their choice. though corruption is prevalent in the mch, it would become rampant after elections, they claim. however, an mch official denied the contractors would be affected at all. the elections would make them more accountable and ensure they carry out quality work, he said. most of the contractors are not carrying out quality work now and are greasing palms of quality control cell officers and getting quality control certificates from them to get their bills passed,'' the official said. after elections, the corporator of that particular locality where work is executed would be able to question the contractor and the officer concerned if the quality of work is not up to the mark, the official said. however, the contractors have their fears. at present, we give a percentage of our profits to mps, mlas and mch officers,but when the councillors are elected, then we will have to provide a share to them too,'' one of the contractors said. on an average, the corporation contracts works worth more than rs 100 crore every year. contracted fears contractors fear they will not get work after municipal elections say corporators will favour men of their own choice there will be more accountability, say officials

10,Govt urged to formulate disaster management policy,"mumbai: the indian people's tribunal on environment and human rights (ipt) has urged the government to formulate a policy that caters to the special needs of marginal groups in gujarat's quake-affected areas. ""the poor as well as minority communities with less voice in public affairs find the rehabilitation and compensation distribution process outright discriminatory,"" says the report of the 11-member ipt panel, which held hearings in the quake-hit areas. the panel was headed by justice k. sukumaran, a retired judge of the kerala and bombay high courts. the panel found that people without property entitlement or tenure records had been denied compensation for habitat loss. banks also refused such people loans to rebuild their houses. dalits, shepherds, fishermen and the like were the hardest hit. the panel also discovered that the lack of information and organisational back-up denied the marginalised classes access to the rehabilitation programmes. noting that there was discrimination on the basis of caste and community, the tribunal recommends a special policy to counter this. since the tribunal found that the authorities had made no efforts to make information available to the affected people, it recommends that the government appoint information officers trained to give up-to-date information about the rehabilitation process. it also suggests that the government web-enable and publish periodically all relevant information about rehabilitation norms, targets and achievements. the panel has also proposed a single-window system for relief measures because the members found that several victims were unable to comprehend the complex rules relating to the rehabilitation package. over 3,000 quake-affected villagers, people's representatives, humanitarian workers as well as a few government officials and media personnel testified before the ipt panel at hearings held at satpar near anjar, samakhyali near bachao and maliya and during the ipt members' visits to several villages. according to the ipt report, rehabilitation measures and compensation disbursement remain grossly inadequate, leaving huge backlogs. even getting compensation for lives lost is cumbersome because of the lack of medico-legal documentation. the report also says that the psychosocial needs of the survivors and the special needs of the physically disabled survivors are not adequately addressed in the rehabilitation process. the panel came to the conclusion that the government was not very clear about its disaster management programme. it had not put in place a planning, coordination and implementation mechanism that focuses on people, their livelihoods, survival strategies and shelter.

12,Minister rules out paying higher prices for cotton,"mumbai: state finance minister jayantrao patil said that the government would buy cotton from growers only at the market price from the next season instead of the earlier practice of procuring cotton at a higher price. he was addressing a conference organised by the indian merchants' chamber here recently. mr patil said procuring cotton at a higher price had placed a heavy burden on the state economy. he admitted that most state governments were in bad financial shape. the old political style of making populist promises to the electorate was no longer sustainable. a new type of political leadership, young, dynamic and willing to take tough measures in the larger national interest, was coming to the fore, he said. most of the states in india were committed to introduce valueadded tax (vat) from april 2002. more tax reforms would be introduced in the next two to three years.

14,Ram temple not an election issue: Rajnath,"lucknow: people's mandate would be sought on the issue of development in the state and the ram temple will not be bjp's electoral plank in the coming assembly elections, up chief minister rajnath singh has said. ""ram temple was never a political issue. it is a cultural issue"", he told pti. he said it was the opposition which made it a political issue to inculcate a sense of fear among the minorities for cornering their votes. ""the coming elections would be a contest between the government's achievements and the hollow promises of the opposition,"" he said. asked about vishwa hindu parishad's (vhp) decision to start the construction of the temple after march 12, he said prime minister atal bihari vajpayee had indicated recently that he was hopeful of finding a solution to the problem by that time. about misuse of mosques and madarsas in the state, the chief minister evaded a direct reply and said the question should be asked to those who opposed poto and the ban on the students islamic movement of india (simi). singh termed as ""irresponsible"" the allegation of the opposition that the bjp wanted to win the elections ""by creating a war hysteria"". the bjp puts national issues above party politics, he said adding such allegations are borne out of frustration. expressing confidence that the bjp would come back to power, the chief minister said his government had ""honestly"" tried to resolve the problems facing the state. asked about the opposition's charge that there were several ministers in his cabinet with criminal background, he said all the ministers were mlas and the election commission had found nothing wrong with their candidature. the opposition's charge in this regard was in fact a criticism of the ec and the constitution, which allowed these mlas to contest elections, he said. singh also pointed out that such allegations were being levelled against some of those ministers, who had won the elections on congress and the bahujan samaj party (bsp) tickets and had later joined the bjp-led coalition government. he claimed that the law and order situation in the state had improved after he has taken reins of the state in his hands.

21,Auditors to examine UTI's investments in 18 firms,"mumbai: uti has appointed nine auditors to scrutinise its investments in 18 companies since january 1992. these companies, which include zee telefilms, satyam computers, dsq software and reliance industries, featured in the tarapore committee report which went into the past investment decisions of uti. the appointed auditors will handle two companies each and a comprehensive audit report will be tabled before the uti board and also submitted before the joint parliamentary committee. the jpc, which is probing the recent stock scam, has also asked for the audit report. ""the terms of reference given to these auditors are quite clear. they will scrutinise every transaction that uti has undertaken with these 18 companies. the audit teams started work on monday said uti spokesperson madhav kumar. the tarapore committee has recommended that uti investments in reliance industries be referred to a pre-investigative body without an audit, though the trust has not decided on the same. meanwhile, uti has sought clearance from sebi to launch a scheme that will invest in equities based on the movement of the bse sensex. this first-of-its-kind scheme, called the uti variable investment scheme, will take a contrarian view on equities. the open-ended equity scheme will, for instance, take 80 per cent or above exposure to equities if the benchmark index touches 3,200. likewise, if the sensex crosses the 4,200-mark, the equity exposure of the scheme will come down to 51 per cent. accordingly, the debt exposure is pegged at a maximum of 15 per cent and government securities up to 40 per cent. as the sensex goes up, the scheme cuts down its equity exposure to book profits and accordingly increases the debt portion which offers relatively risk-free returns. meanwhile, uti officials said that corporate and institutions have resorted to large-scale buying of us-64 units at current low levels to bring down the average cost of their existing portfolio. since january 1, investors have bought rs 44 crore worth of us-64 units. they added that only less than 2 per cent investors availed of the arbitrage facilities by offloading existing units and buying the same portfolio at a lower nav.
