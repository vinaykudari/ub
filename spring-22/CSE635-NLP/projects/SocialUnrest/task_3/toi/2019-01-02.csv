4,Consumers urge govt to discipline cable operators,"pune: with cable operators choosing to live by the law of the jungle, cable tv subscribers in the city, under the banner of grahak hitavardhini, have urged the state government to take urgent steps to regulate and control cable tv business. representatives of the organisation submitted a memorandum in this regard to state minister for food, civil supplies and consumer protection laxman dhoble on tuesday. the memorandum, drafted by gh president sudhakar velankar, observes that since there is little regulation or law-enforcement in the cable business, anti-social elements have entered it and are using muscle power to further their business.the fight for cable territories among cable operators could flare up in gang wars, it warns. the emerging monopolistic nature of the business suited major channels and they are encouraging such elements, the memorandum alleges. listing discrepancies and problems plaguing the cable industry, velankar said there was no co-relation between monthly subscription fees charged by the operators, the number of channels shown and the quality of transmission. the charges extorted by operators while giving new connections have no uniformity and no receipt is issued to subscribers. the gh memorandum points out that although the cable business is bound by the consumer protection act (1986), monopolies and restrictive trade practices act (1969) and cable television regulation act (1995), these legislations have no mention of subscribers' rights. moreover, they do not give the state government any punitive powers. however, the state government could use other existing legal provisions to regulate and control the cable tv business. velankar has welcomed measures taken by additional commissioner of pune police s m mushrif in the city to reign in cable operators. the memorandum suggests that in order to regulate the monetary side of the business, the state revenue department could provide operators with special stamped receipt books for the purpose of issuing receipts to subscribers. the licences of operators failing to issue such receipts could be cancelled as a disciplinary action. the subscribers' co-operative also calls for a mandatory agreement between the cable operators and respective subscribers, listing details of the services to be provided. the draft of such an agreement could be ratified by the government, it adds. the memorandum has also underlined the need for regulating television channels. although it was impossible to regulate the actual broadcasting organisations, as many of them beamed their programmes from abroad, the government could enforce existing laws on representatives and distributors of these channels. velankar felt that this should be done immediately in the interest of subscribers, especially when private companies were set to enter this field, under the convergence act.
