0,"Advani's influence growing in party, govt","NEW DELHI: The Prime Ministerâ€™s gradual withdrawing from the public eye â€” tactical or not â€” has highlighted the growing clout of his deputy.

In little over a month since his status as the unchallenged number two was given an official stamp, L K Advani has been juggling government with party dexterously. Thursday nightâ€™s meeting, where he brokered peace between Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi and former CM Keshubhai Patel â€” in the absence of the PM â€” was just the latest instance of his increasing clout in party matters. And the official endorsement that Modi would be the partyâ€™s chief ministerial candidate meant that the PMâ€™s unhappiness with this was set aside.

So whether it was the decision to replace K Jana Krishnamurthy with M Venkaiah Naidu as party president mid-course, or addressing the weekly meeting of BJP MPs when Parliament is open â€” earlier done by both the PM and Advani â€” or interacting with groups of party MPs statewise, meeting the RSS top brass to sort out the differences over J&K, not to mention the weekly visits to the BJP headquarters, it is Advani all the way.

On Saturday, Advani will kick off a series of interactions between BJP ministers and sympathisers among the opinion makers when he addresses a meeting of BJP intellectuals. Meetings on state matters, such as the one on Gujarat, or on who would be given which post in the party, which were earlier being held at the PMâ€™s residence, are now being held at Naiduâ€™s residence. None of this has gone unnoticed and some senior BJP leaders, other than the PM, who have been marginalised in the process are sore about the changed power equations in the party.

On the governmental front, too, Advaniâ€™s say has increased.

It was he who negotiated with the Trinamul Congress MPs on the railway bifurcation issue before the matter came to the cabinet.

On the issue of the petrol pump scam, the PMâ€™s view was that the party should abandon the issue after cancelling the allotments. But clearly, now, it is Advaniâ€™s line that is prevailing â€” the aggressive way in which the party is confronting the Congresss. He also has a greater say in Kashmir affairs. The appointment of Arun Jaitley as a negotiator on the devolution issue is being cited as a a case in point. All files relating to senior official appointments are also routed through Advani.

What does this all add up to? While many in the BJP see this as the beginning of the transition to an Advani-led government, some party veterans say Vajpayee will remain number one as long as he wishes to.

1,Divide in Rajkot city Cong comes to fore during rally,"RAJKOT: The divide in the city unit of the Congress came to the fore on Friday when the ''BJP hatao Gujarat bachao'' rally was taken out.

While city unit president Ashok Dangar had called for the rally to be taken out from Trikon Baugh, former city unit president Mahonersinh Jadeja, who is yet to come to terms with the appointment of Dangar, took out his personal ''BJP hatao'' rally from the palace.

Both the rallies were talk of the town that sent cheers in the BJP circles as it exposed the sharp division in the city unit of the Congress. While more party workers participated in the Dangar-led rally, the one led by Jadeja comprised mostly his personal followers.

When contacted, the city unit president of the party told TNN that the issue would be taken up with the state and central leaderships and Jadeja would be asked not to make a public mockery of the divide in the party. The party memorandum stated that the BJP has failed on all fronts, including the issue of price rise, providing security to people especially the lives of Amarnath ''yatris'' and the security of the country as a whole. It also said that the BJP government failed even to protect the Parliament.

Similar rallies were taken out all over Saurashtra.

2,Akalis accuse govt of witch-hunting,"FEROZEPUR: Even in Ferozepur district Akali leaders and workers turned up in large numbers at the districtlevel protest rally organised by the district Shiromani Akali Dal to protest the antiemployee, anti-farmer, anti-Dalit and anti-trader policies and decisions of the Amarinder Singh government here on Friday.

Former Punjab irrigation minister Janmeja Singh Shekhon presided over the rally.

Others present on the occasion included MP Jora Singh Mann, Hari Singh Zira and Sukhpal Singh Nannu (both MLAs), Paramjit Singh and Sher Singh (both ex-MLAs), district BJP president Ajaybir Singh Sodhi and BJP general secretary Ashwini Dhingra.

MP from Ferozepur Jora Singh Mann charged the Congress with the murder of democracy in the state and embarking on a vendetta against the Akali-BJP workers and leaders.

He added that his party president had given the Congress a fair amount of time (six months) to start fulfilling the promises made to the people of the state during assembly elections in February.

The promises include a bonus of Rs 30 per quintal to paddy growers, implementation of 9-4-14 promotion scheme for state and PSU employees, among others. â€˜â€˜The Congress has forgotten all the promises.

Instead it has started to punish the people by imposing wage cuts, stopping the facility of DA and LTC, imposing massive power cuts and freezing government jobs. All this in the name of â€˜empty coffersâ€™ which have been inherited from the SAD-BJP alliance,â€™â€™ he added.

Janmeja Singh Shekhon criticised the Congress for not having a clear agenda to run the government with.

He said that the Congress had instead resorted to implicating Akali workers and leaders in false cases with the sole motive of diverting the attention of the people from the unfulfilled promises made during the elections.

â€˜â€˜Why is the CMâ€™s secretariat oversized? Why have wage cuts not been imposed on ministers and political appointees?â€™â€™ he asked.

He added that the SAD-BJP government had continued to spend on development works in both rural and urban areas till the time the election code was announced.

3,Police fail to arrest former Osamanabad Bank chief,"PUNE: Former chairman of the Osmanabad District Central Co-operative Bank, Pawanraje Nimbalkar, was not formally arrested by the crime investigation department (CID) on Friday, a day after he was traced and a security ring thrown around him.

Nimbalkar, who is a suspect in the multi-crore-rupee government securities scam and evading arrest for almost three months now, was traced by the police at the Inlaks Budhrani hospital here on Thursday. CID chief A.K. Agarwal said, â€œSince he is still in hospital, we have not formally arrested him.

There is no point in arresting him at this stage as we will not be able to interrogate him. But we are keeping a strict watch.â€� Hospital director Rear Admiral (retd.) I. Karnani said Nimbalkar was suffering from mild chest pain and he has been kept under observation. However, it was reliably learnt that CID officials are contemplating shifting Nimbalkar to the government-run Sassoon Hospital. The police have snapped all his communication links with the outside world, except with the hospitalâ€™s doctors.

4,SAD holds state-wide dharna against govt policies,"CHANDIGARH: The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) kicked off its agitational politics on Friday when it organised state-wide dharnas to protest against the alleged anti-employees and anti-farmer policies of the Amarinder Singh government.

Former chief minister Prakash Singh Badal, in a statement here on Friday, claimed that state-wide dharnas evoked overwhelming response from people and party workers which indicated widespread resentment prevailing against the state government.

He said the dharnas highlighted the state government policies which had proved detrimental to the interests of farmers and government employees alike.

When the SAD-BJP returns to power it will be just as vindictive as the Congress has been with the Opposition, said former deputy speaker Sat Pal Gosain at a dharna on Friday.

Over thousand Akali supporters, from all the 12 constituencies of the district, gathered at the deputy commissionerâ€™s office here to lodge their protest against the functioning of the Congress government.

People continued to pour in till Friday afternoon in all kinds of vehicles.

The rush also caused a traffic jam on the Ferozepur road.

The dharna was lead by both present and former MPs and MLAs, including Sat Pal Gosain, Jagdish Singh Garcha, Ranjit Singh Talwandi, Inder Iqbal Singh Atwal, Bhag Singh Mallah, Darshan Singh Shivalik and others.

The Akali and BJP leaders severely criticised chief minister Amarinder Singh and his governmentâ€™s policies.

They said that Amarinderâ€™s style of working was similar to that of an Army man and a dictator, not a chief minister in a democracy.

The leaders here urged former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal to be strong if he wanted to return to power. Speakers at the dharna said that development work under the Congress had come to a standstill.

A woman speaker said that the Damoria, Dhuri Line and Gaspura bridge had been constructed during Badalâ€™s regime.

The speaker added that no development activities could be witnessed under the Congress regime.

The leaders also criticised Amarinder Singh for putting a stop to schemes like Shagun, Old Age Pension, among others.

5,Vigilance bureau arrests ex-minister Ajit Kohar,"CHANDIGARH: The Vigilance Bureau picked up yet another former SAD minister Ajit Singh Kohar, for allegedly amassing properties disproportionate to his sources of income.

Kohar was arrested by VB sleuths while he was taking part in the party dharna in Jalandhar in front of the deputy commissionerâ€™s office.

According to VB spokesman, Kohar purchased 90 acres of land in Faridkot district through 24 sale deed out of which Kohar acquired five acres for himself while the rest for his family members.

In all the registries there are same witnesses and price of Rs 1 lakh per acre was quoted for the entire land.

Kohar got out-of-turn electricity connections for five tubewells and is said to have share in a petrol pump.

The former minister purchased a new car and two jeeps after joining the SADBJP ministry in which he was minister for jails.

The spokesman said that without conducting any sale of potatoes, Kohar got forged receipts for selling potatoes worth Rs 30-40 lakh.

A case under Section 420 and 120-B, IPC, has been registered against him.

6,State govt plans to market condoms more effectively,"KOLKATA: Alarmed at the relatively poor use of condoms in the state (11 per cent of the people in the reproductive age-group still have no access to condoms while 20 per cent of the supplies last year remained undistributed), the state government is toying with the idea of changing its marketing strategy.

Condoms are currently distributed through primary health centres in the villages.

But partly because of the cumbersome timings when they generally remain open (doctors come in the afternoon or the health centres shut down too early) and partly due to the indifferent attitude of the staff manning them, distribution of condoms in the state remained unsatisfactory, explain health officials.

A â€˜novelâ€™ plan, therefore, has been worked out to identify a â€˜popularâ€™ person in every village to act as the supplier of condoms on commission. This would be a much better mechanism, felt D.K. Ghorai, state family welfare officer. Villagers, he argued, could approach this person at any hour of the day or night and â€˜familiarityâ€™ could actually be an advantage in overcoming inhibition.

The department would like to launch the scheme and see if familiarity would actually work as a deterrent. Selection of the person has already started in most of the blocks of the state.

The person in charge of distribution will get 10 paise per condom from the government. â€œThe ideal person will have to be popular and approachable â€” a quack, a teacher or a social worker â€” as people will have to go to him and ask for a condom overcoming their reservationsâ€� he said.

â€œPeople in the villages do not buy condoms in bulk, as they do not have that much ready cash.

â€œSo condoms will have to be made available to them when they need it,â€� he said. The government, for effective implementation of the plan, will train quacks in different villages.

â€œOne has to accept the ground realities. â€œThe quacks are still the most accessible and trusted people,â€� argued Ghorai.â€� The block primary health centres currently supply oral pills, condoms, Copper T, quincacrine and other contraceptives.

â€œBut use of contracpetives other than condoms require some training and the distributors have to be trained.

â€œThis involves expenditure which we are in no position to spend,â€� Ghorai said. In West Bengal, only about five per cent people use condoms as a means of contraception while 87 per cent people use other forms of contraception.

7,"STF cracks Hathras abduction case, arrests 3","LUCKNOW: In a major operation in the state capital, the Special Task Force (STF) on Friday arrested three persons and rescued a three-year-old boy.

Son of Hathras-based Public Relation Officer of a former minister, the boy, Magan, had been kidnapped for ransom on July 30.

The arrests were made when the accused came to collect the money at Sitapur Road. Raids were being conducted at various places in Lucknow to trace the other members of the gang.

Inspector General (IG) STF SN Singh told reporters that Hari Om Prashar was the personal assistant and PRO of the former cabinet minister Shyam Sunder Sharma of Loktantrik Congress Party (LCP). At his native Sadabad residence in Haathras, Parashar had a domestic help, Arun, of Sitapur. Last year, Arun had asked for Rs 10,000 from Hari Omâ€™s wife Rani Parashar on the pretext that he had been involved in a police case and wanted the money to settle the issue.

When Parashar refused, Arun left the job. On July 30, around 4:30 pm, Arun visited Parashars and took away Magan on the pretext of buying him some chaat. Both of them did not return till late evening. Around 8:00 pm the same day, someone identifying himself as Abhay called up Parashars, saying that Arun had brought Magan to Agra and the two would reach back Hathras within an hour. However, Magan did not return.

A series of phone calls later, Abhay confirmed that Magan had actually been kidnapped and demanded Rs 25 lakh as ransom. The negotiations continued and the deal was finally struck at Rs 8 lakh.

Senior Superintendent of police (SP) STF Rajiv Ranjan Verma said that the Haathras police and the STF got on the job a day after the kidnapping. Finally, Friday was fixed for delivery of ransom to be paid near Sewa Hospital and Braj Ki Rasoi restaurant on Sitapur Road.

Maganâ€™s father reached the site with the money in a suitcase and met Arun at a paan shop. Arun revealed that Magan was in a white Maruti van within 5-kilometre radius of the site and would be produced after he counted the ransom amount. The STF team, following Parashar, then nabbed Arun and started searching for the vehicle as specified by him. But, soon they discovered that Arun had misled them.

SP STF Anant Deo said later Arun disclosed that the actual vehicle was a grey-colour van from which Magan was later rescued.

The arrested accused revealed that the rest of the gang members moving in a red Qualis had managed to escape. Jagdamba also revealed that among the absconding accused was Ankush, his neighbour from Basti, who was studying at a dental college in the state capital near Chinhat.

8,Lawyers’ protest at Sadar Tehsil turns violent,"LUCKNOW: Lawyers on Friday once again took to the roads and pelted stones on a passing bus and other vehicles at Nari Shiksha Niketan crossing, damaged furniture at Sadar Tehsil and the district Collectorate forcing closure of offices as per their announcement on Thursday to protest against the murder of former Bar Association president ID Singh.

Later, a condolence meeting was held after the body of ID Singh was brought to the site before his final journey began.

The trouble began when a group of nearly 300 lawyers reached the Sadar Tehsil office and found the employees engaged in routine work.

Agitated over it, the lawyers forced the employees to stall all work and even entered into a scuffle with some of the employees who resisted their diktats. After the office was completely closed, the mob reached the civil court.

Here the employees had already complied with the bandh call. The lawyers then reached the multi-storeyed building and locked the gates.

The lawyers found officials and employee engaged in routine work in the district collectorate. Infuriated over it, the lawyers went berserk and damaged a PCO and some furniture. They also forced the paan shop owners to shut their kiosks around the collectorate.

The lawyers later pelted stones on a passing bus and some private vehicles. When a posse of PAC jawans and circle officer Kaiserbagh tried to intervene, the mob virtually forced them back into a corner and some even misbehaved with the policemen.

9,MSR drought protest a drama: TDP,"HYDERABAD: The Telugu Desam Party (TDP) on Friday ridiculed the Andhra Pradesh Congress Committee president M Satyanarayana Raoâ€™s one-day protest against the alleged failure of the government to draft a comprehensive plan to tackle the prevailing drought conditions in the state.

In a press release, TDP leaders N Siva Prasad, R Prakash Reddy and A M Radhakrishna termed the protest as a ""publicity drama"" and accused the Congress leaders of organising protests to ""show their existence"".

The TDP leaders said that revenue and agriculture ministers had already met Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee and sought Rs 810 crore central aid and 15 lakh tonnes of rice under the Food-for-Work programme to tide over the drought.

Sivaprasad alleged that the Congress leaders lacked sincerity in seeking drought relief from the Centre.

He said the non-participation of the Congress MPs from the state in the delegation of the Congress-ruled states chief ministers which the prime minister under the leadership of AICC president Sonia Gandhi clearly showed their insincerity towards the stateâ€™s problems. The delegation sought Centreâ€™s assistance to drought-affected states under the natural calamity fund.

Pointing out that the drought conditions in the state was not even mentioned by Sonia Gandhi, the TDP leader said that this clearly indicated the ""clout"" the opposition leader Y S Rajasekhara Reddy enjoys with the party leadership. He further alleged that the state was given the â€˜step motherly treatmentâ€™ by the Congress when it was in power at the Centre.

Sivaprasad criticised the Congress for â€˜politicisingâ€™ the Food-for-Work (FFW) programme. ""Rajasekhara Reddy criticises the FFW scheme on one hand but had laid a road to his farm under the programme on the other,"" he alleged.

He condemned the Congress leader V Hanumantha Raoâ€™s dharna in New Delhi opposing the Centreâ€™s move to sanction par boiled rice to the state under the FFW scheme.

11,JW Marriott Chennai to be ready by 2005,"NEW DELHI: Global hotel major Marriott International will break ground for its Chennai property later this year and hopes to see it up by 2004-05.

13,Advani holds parleys with party elite,"NEW DELHI: In yet another step towards closer interaction with the party, Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani on Saturday had a brain-storming session with an elite section of the BJP cadre in which he dwelt at length on the current political situation and controversies.

The hour-long interaction with city-based members of the party''s intellectual, professional and trade cells covered a number of subjects, including the need for sustaining coalition and alliance politics and to project BJP as a ""party and government with a difference.""

Issues such as the petrol pumps scam, the shifting of Yashwant Sinha from the finance ministry, the Gujarat Assembly elections, the uniform civil code and rampant corruption in administration were also raised by the members at the closed door meeting presided over by party general secretary and spokesman Arun Jaitley at the BJP headquarters here, party sources said.

Taking off from the Delhi Pledge adopted at the party''s national council meeting here last Saturday and Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee''s address there, Advani said that though the party would like to get a majority of its own in the next Lok Sabha elections, it would like to take along its NDA allies.

In this regard, he cited the ''West Bengal model'', where despite the CPM having its own majority, other left parties such as CPI, RSP and Forward Block were part of the government, they said.

15,Forum warns of more suicides,"JALANDHAR: Social Sciences and Health Forum has cautioned that Punjab is again on the verge of a spate of suicides, this time due to failure of the unviable paddy crop grown unnaturally in Punjab.

A tragedy similar to that of the cotton growing area in â€˜98-â€™99 is looming large. There is a risk of famine-like situation due to shortage of fodder for animals, as the fodder crop has been allowed to wilt by farmers desperate to save their paddy fields.

The forum, an NGO born out of the present crisis, emphasises that the wheat- paddy monoculture is unnatural for the weather and soil conditions of Punjab. The areas under paddy need to be diversified to traditional crops natural to the weather and geological conditions of the region.

The Forum reiterated that the present drought in north Indian states including Punjab is not a â€˜naturalâ€™ disaster. â€˜â€˜It is the result of excess withdrawal of scarce ground water in arid regions to grow thirsty cash crops for the market instead of water-prudent food crops for local needs. The government should immediately step in to guarantee support for diversification by ensuring minimum support price, procurement and processing of pulses, oil seeds, maize, kinoos, grapes etc, which the farmers should opt for by abandoning the paddy-wheat cycle.â€™â€™

The diversification should be protected against dumping in the Indian market by developed countries. The forest cover has been reduced to less than three per cent. Further, damage to environment has been done by eucalyptus, which has been recklessly planted even in areas having scarce water resources, the forum says. Timetested trees like kikar, tali, neem, mango, jamun etc are dwindling rapidly.

Thandi Khuhi, near the 140 years old Mohindra College in Patiala, was a source of water to more than four generations of students of the Malwa region. It has now become defunct. The wells and hand pumps in the villages and towns of Punjab have dried up. After Green Revolution, farmers in Punjab abandoned their traditional cropping practice in favour of western wheatrice cropping method, aggressively marketed by the agro-industrial complex.

As a result, shallow wells, traditionally used for irrigation, have run dry. While affluent farmers started using deep tube wells and have been increasing the depth of wells by an average of half-a-metre every year. They are even installing submersible pumps at a depth beyond 300 feet. One such submersible pump costs from Rs 60,000 to over one lakh rupees.

However, the not so well off small and marginal farmers have to borrow heavily to do the same at an interest ranging from 24 to 36 per cent. This new expenditure due to constant fall in water table has crippled the farm economy.

16,Early polls seem unlikely in Gujarat,"AHMEDABAD/VADODARA: Going by the utterances and body language of Chief Election Commissioner J M Lyngdoh - both in public and closed-door meetings - over the past couple of days, early elections seem unlikely in Gujarat.

Top civil and police officials got a severe tongue-lashing from Lyngdoh at a closed-door meeting on Friday, and on Saturday, the CEC reprimanded Vadodara''s district collector and police commissioner in full public view.

The state''s top officials were in trouble the moment chief secretary G Subba Rao opined that the ""situtation in the state is normal"". ""You call this normal; you have the temerity to say so,"" lambasted Lyngdoh. ""Have you been to the relief camps? I suggest you go to the relief camps and stay there for two days.""

Later, during the course of an hour-long meeting, Lyngdoh''s temper flashed again when additional director general of police in charge of intelligence R B Sreekumar said: ""If we have to hold elections in the state,we require more forces."" Lyngdoh looked at the chief secretary and sharply riposted: ""Reconcile this for me. You say the situation is normal, but yet you require more forces for polls?""

Additional chief secretary (home) Ashok Narain interjected at this point to say: ""Sir, what he means is that..."" Lyngdoh cut him off mid-sentence: ""Does he require help from you for interpetation or translation...""

A top civil official present at the meeting told The Times of India: ""We will have to wait for the EC to come out with a clear view on the timing of elections, but going by the places visited by them and the way the meetings have been conducted, I have serious doubts that they will give the green signal for elections immediately.""

On Saturday morning, Lyngdoh gave Vadodara district collector Bhagyesh Jha a piece of his mind, blaming him for ""not having complete information"" regarding the Best Bakery tragedy.

A furious Lyngdoh, accompanied by TS Krishnamurthy and BB Tandon, lashed out at Jha as the latter fumbled to answer a question put to him at Hanuman Tekri, where mobs had burnt alive 14 people inside the bakery on March 2.

""You don''t have complete information. You talk about sporadic incidents. Where are the details? Are you not ashamed of yourself?...Are you a joker?"" he shouted at Jha as Amin Sayeed of the Maulana Azad Foundation briefed Lyngdoh on the happenings of that night and told him that no Muslim had returned to Hanuman Tekri yet.

It was at this point, gauging the fury of the CEC, that city police commissioner DD Tuteja did a vanishing act and left the team to itself. But Tuteja had to face the music at the Circuit House later in the afternoon when Lyngdoh asked him to ""cut short his rhetoric on police action and provide precise information about deaths in the city during the riots"".

""You have explained to me stages of riots, now tell me about the concentration of deaths in these stages. Have you arrested any MLA, MP or taken action against politicians who have been alleged to have played a role in the riots?"" asked Lyngdoh. ""...no, you don''t seem to have the data on this,"" he told a stunned Tuteja.

BJP minority cell chairman Gani Qureshi too came in for severe flak when he tried to defend the government action while a victim was narrating his woes at the Raja Rani Talav area. ""Are you a police agent?"" Lyngdoh asked Qureshi.

Vaghela made the best of this opportunity to announce that the Congress would provide all the basic infrastructure needed for the growth of industries in the state. He said the BJP had failed to deliver goods in all spheres and it was time there was a change in governance. He exhorted party workers to gear up to oust the BJP from the state.

He announced that the Congress, if brought to power, would give dole of Rs 2,000 to each unemployed youth in the state, and also said that the problems related to power tariff for powerloom industry too would be sorted out.

He also took a dig at the recent controversy in the state BJP over the resignation of Haren Pandya and said the BJP was a divided party. Congress, he said, today stood as an undivided party.

Leader of Opposition Amarsinh Chaudhary, sensing the mood among the crowd comprising mostly from the textile industry, said Union textile minister Kashiram though an MP from the city had failed to protect the textile industry. He assured that the Congress was committed to the development of the economy.

AICC general secretary and Gujarat in-charge Kamal Nath urged the gathering to save the country by ousting the BJP not only from Gujarat but elsewhere too.

Here some 20,000 people who had come from different parts of South Gujarat joined the rally.

People from Bharuch, Narmada, Navsari, Valsad, Ahwa-Dangs came to the attend the rally in scores of trucks, jeeps and mini-buses. Traffic on the busy Raj Marg remained disrupted due to movement of the rallyists.
