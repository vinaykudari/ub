0,Citizens rally for peace and harmony in Mumbai,"MUMBAI: Is the Maharashtra government doing enough to curb hate speech and writing at a time of growing communal tension?

Communal harmony groups and concerned citizens who believe that enforcing anti-hate speech laws will help promote peace say the state government is reluctant to crack down on rabble rousers. In a meeting with chief minister Sushilkumar Shinde on Wednesday, several prominent citizens pressed for vigorous enforcement of laws like Section 153-A and 295 of the Indian Penal Code, which provide for punishment against inflammatory speeches and writings.

""The real aim of a terrorist is to polarise society,"" lyricist Javed Akthar reasoned. ""Such writings also polarise society, and aid terrorists."" Akhtarâ€™s views were echoed by Mumbai University vice-chancellor B L Mungekar, who said: ""Since 1993, the political process in the city has been based on hatred because of communal propaganda and poison spread through various publications. We need to stop it.""

Additional chief secretary (home) U Mukhopadhyay said the state government would consider the citizensâ€™ demands. ""But will wielding a big stick stop communal hatred? In the name of pursuing action, we should not create more conflict,"" he said.

While it is the recent bomb blasts that have spurred citizensâ€™ groups to lobby for greater enforcement of Section 153-A, momentum on this demand has been building since the Gujarat communal riots last year.

3,FII investments touch all-time high,"AHMEDABAD: Foreign institutional investors'' (FIIs) net investments in equities and debt have touched an annual all-time high of Rs 14,279.5 crore since January 2003, with 72 per cent going into equities and only 28 per cent making it to debt markets.

The previous highest figure was Rs 13,293 crore reported in the whole of 2001, according to Securities and Exchange Board of India figures. In dollar terms too, net FII investments from January to August 2003 have touched an all-time high of $ 3 billion as against the previous high of $ 2.84 billion achieved during the calendar year 2001.

FIIs'' gross purchases in 2003 were lower at Rs 51,574 crore as against Rs 56,799 crore in 2001. But, gross sales in 2001 were higher at Rs 43,506 as against Rs 37,294 crore in 2003.

Also, while the figures for 2001 are for 12 months, those of 2003 are for eight months only.

Interestingly, out of the total net investments of Rs 14,279.5 crore, FIIs have invested Rs 10,349 crore in equities, that is 72 per cent, while only 28 per cent has gone into debt instruments. The last four months, May to August, accounted for the bulk of FII inflows into equity of Rs 8,240 crore. These figures indicate the bullishness amongst FIIs for the Indian equity markets.

But, a small warning signal is noticeable. After a high of Rs 2,582 crore in June, FIIs'' net investments in equities have declined to Rs 2,346 crore in July and further to Rs 2,091 crore in August. Most market players expect the stock markets boom to last for another 6 to 12 months and are optimistic about FII flows being strong for some more time.

Executive director of Kotak Mahindra Bank, Dipak Gupta, said that during a recent investors'' meet at Singapore he saw tremendous interest amongst foreign investors wanting to invest in Indian equities. He said that the large forex reserves and strong rupee along with good economic growth would lead to more FII flows coming to India.

SK Mitra, director-financial services of the Aditya Birla group, said that even after the over 1000-points spurt in the BSE Sensex, the Indian equity markets were still attractive vis-a-vis other Asian markets.

A Morgan Stanley report has estimated that FIIs own about 12 per cent of the Indian market and around 35 per cent of the free float available (free float implied by the MSCI India Index). ""What is more significant is that FIIs have raised their stake in the top 38 companies by 300 bps to 21.5 per cent (well over 50 per cent of free float) over the past two years.

Despite the recent increase in investments outside the top-38 companies, FII investments remain highly concentrated. The top-15 holdings are currently valued at US $13.8 billion, and account for 83% of the investments in the top 38 companies, up from 80% 12 months ago, by our estimates,"" the report added.

5,"Temple, polls: UP CM on tenterhooks","LUCKNOW: There was little comfort for Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav on Sunday, with Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) state chief Vinay Katiyar hinting that assembly elections would be held ahead of the forthcoming Lok Sabha polls.

Urging party workers to take to the streets against the Mulayam government, Katiyar said: â€˜â€˜Another elections in the state are possible. It will be held either before Lok Sabha or along with it.â€™â€™

Speaking at the partyâ€™s Kisan Morcha, Katiyar fired the first salvo against Mulayam on the Ayodhya issue. â€˜â€˜Mulayam will adorn a Muslim cap and Hindus wonâ€™t hesitate in wearing the saafa to recreate the 1991 situation in which the Congress-supported Mulayam government had sprayed bullets on Ram Bhakts,â€™â€™ said Katiyar, announcing that the party would raise a similar storm to demand temple construction.

Katiyar said the fall of the Mayawati government has landed the BJP in a 1991-like situation. â€˜â€˜Communal tension will increase and ISI activities touch a new height. Our hands were tied under Mayawatiâ€™s regime, but we wonâ€™t hesitate in taking on Mulayam,â€™â€™ he said.

Elated at the ASI report, Katiyar advised Mulayam to hold talks with Muslim leaders for surrendering the disputed land or face the consequences. That the BJP plans to bring the temple back in focus is evident from the fact that Katiyar announced that the party would take up VHPâ€™s Ram Raksha programme from September 25 â€” the birth anniversary of Dr Shyama Prasad Mukherji.
