1,GM keen on driving trucks into Indian mart,"new delhi: the world's largest automotive firm general motors corp is contemplating driving into the commercial vehicle market in india. ''we feel that with the resurgence of medium and heavy trucks in india, commercial vehicles is a market worth having a presence in. it's a potential market and we are looking forward to developing this segment in india with our models,'' senior company sources told the times of india. the fresh thinking seems to stem from the growth in medium and heavy (m&h) trucks sales over the past few months. according to data compiled by the society of indian automobile manufacturers (siam), m&h truck sales have witnessed a 5.4 per cent growth in the first eight months of the current fiscal to 43,264 units. telco, the country's largest truck maker itself recorded an around 10 per cent surge in sales during the period. general motors india president aditya vij, when contacted, said: ''we do not rule out anything. but i can't talk more.'' meanwhile, the sources pointed out that gm is likely to look at the fully built unit import route for initially introducing the commercial vehicles in india.''at the current level, the indian truck market has great scope for development.'' the truck market in india is today ruled by the tata group flagship telco, followed by the hinduja group firm ashok leyland. according to gm's internal projections, total commercial vehicle sales are likely to arrest the decline witnessed in the previous years and maintain its steady pace through 2002. the firm is also actively working towards introducing a series of models through the cbu (completely built unit) route in india. these include saab, cadillac and the new-generation vectra. while the new vectra will take on the might of honda accord in the rs 15-16 lakh segment, the saab 9-3 and 9-5 models will be positioned against the mercedes c-class and e-class. the cadillac will be gm's super-luxury offering in india, pitted against the rs 60 lakh mercedes s-class. in addition, it is also actively studying the feasibility of rolling out an array of sports utility vehicles, including the chevrolet blazer and isuzu panther. it is also preparing to launch the indian edition of its online arm —gmbuypower —this year. riding on these efforts, the firm says it will drive out of the red in the 2002 calendar year.

2,Former Naxalites say terror law will fail,"patna: those affiliated with either extreme left or extreme rightist groups appear to be unanimous that the prevention of terrorism ordinance (poto) will fail to check extremists' activities. among the extreme left groups are the maoist communist centre (mcc) and the people's war group, while the rightist group is a private army ranvir sena. both the mcc and pwg do not accept the constitution, parliament and the laws of the land. what difference will it make to their illegal activities, said umadhar prasad singh, the cpi-ml(new democracy) mla from darbhanga district. singh led the underground naxalite activities in the 1960s and 1970s and was charged with murder. at present, he is an independent mla supporting the rabri government. he said the union government wants to inflict more atrocities on people. no law can make any difference to an underground structure. carrying arms and shooting people, in any case, is illegal even in the existing set of laws, said dr vinayan, another ex-naxalite leader who led the majdoor kisan sangram samiti (mkss), which was among the first outfits banned by the state government.vinayan stressed that extremist outfits like the mcc and the pwg existed due to their support among people. even decades after independence, officials do not know what the minimum wages of agricultural labourers are, let alone implementing them. land reforms are virtually non-existent, he added. while press notes issued by the mcc and pwg have virtually ridiculed the ban on them through the poto and have also threatened to intensify their armed struggle, even their arch rival and extreme rightist group ranvir sena has described the ban on poto as insufficient. though for different reasons, fugitive sena chief brahmeshwar singh said the real terrorists sit inside the state assembly, parliament and in government offices he almost taunted the centre saying it should ban his organisation under the poto. at least, people will realise that the ranvir sena does not depend on foreign elements for arms and funds, he said.

3,Deceased cotton farmer's kin to get compensation,"nagpur: the proceedings in both houses of the state legislature on tuesday will give cotton growers of vidarbha something to smile about. agriculture minister rohiddas patil announced in the legislative council that the centre had cleared imports of genetically modified (gm) cotton seeds from january. in the assembly, marketing minister ganpatrao deshmukh agreed to pay compensation to a family from nanded district four of whose members were killed when a heap of unsold cotton fell on them. the issue was raised in the assembly by bjp group leader gopinath munde and others, who contended that the government's failure to open cotton procurement centres in time was the main cause for the deaths in apparaopeth village.

4,"Abide by rules or face the stick, police tell cablewallahs","pune: with a growing number of complaints coming in from subscribers as well as the revenue department against cable operators, the city police for the first time held a formal meeting with major cable operators in the city and ordered them to follow all the rules or face punitive action. the meeting with cable operators who have more than 300 connections, was chaired by additional commissioner of police s.m. mushrif.the senior police officer minced no words while warning the cable operators to follow the rules under the central cable regulatory act 1995, cinematography act 1952 and the copyright act. ""nobody should operate without taking a proper licence from the posts and telegraph department. besides, operators should restrict themselves to the area mentioned in the certificate provided by the p&t office,"" he told them. mr mushrif also criticised the cable operators for not following the advertisement code. he said the law was clear that the operators should only show full screen ads in between the programmes. ""the current trend of blocking the upper and lower half of the screen with strips of ads should stop,"" he warned. he said operators should ensure that none of the programmes broadcast by them were communally sensitive or disturb the integrity of the nation. significantly, mr mushrif said he would take action against operators who failed to show at least two channels of doordarshan on the prime band.""it is mandatory under the central act,"" he said. several operators were found to be using sub-standard equipment, robbing viewers of picture quality, he observed.""the control-room owners must ensure that all their input-holders use isi marked equipment,"" he said. mr mushrif also asked the operators to issue receipts providing full details about their registration number,name, number of channels shown and the total fees charged, along with a break-up. what seemed to have upset cable operators the most, though, was mr mushrif insisting that an operator could not enter a subscriber's premises to cut of a connection if the subscriber had not paid his subscription charges. mr mushrif said his department would treat such an entry into a subscribers' home as an act of trespassing, which was a cognisable offence under the indian penal code (ipc). speaking on behalf of the cable operators, president of the pune associated cables (pac) vasant patwardhan said it was not possible to list of 60 channels along with the monthly bill. he, however agreed to the advertising code of carrying only full screen ads and issuing proper receipts.

5,Govt to pay damages to deceased cotton farmer's kin,"nagpur: the proceedings in both houses of the state legislature on tuesday will give cotton growers of vidarbha something to smile about.agriculture minister rohiddas patil announced in the legislative council that the centre had cleared imports of genetically modified (gm) cotton seeds from january.in the assembly, marketing minister ganpatrao deshmukh agreed to pay compensation to a family from nanded district, four of whose members were killed when a heap of unsold cotton fell on them.the issue was raised in the assembly by bjp group leader gopinath munde and others, who contended that the government's failure to open cotton procurement centres in time was the main cause for the death of the farmer, his wife and two children in apparaopeth village in kinwat taluka. the opposition was offended when the minister said the government had not considered paying any compensation since it was an accident. opposition members rushed to the well of the house, alleging that the government was shirking its responsibility.the accident would never have occurred had the government opened procurement centres on the promised date, they insisted. the opposition demanded that a compensation of rs 2 lakhs per victim be paid to the next of kin. amidst din and sloganeering by the opposition, speaker arun gujarathi adjourned the house for ten minutes. when the proceedings resumed, the minister announced that in view of the sentiments expressed by the members, the government would pay a lumpsum compensation.in the council, the government was pulled up for its failure to publish a government resolution to give effect to the new package for cotton growers announced by the chief minister in both houses last week. the issue was raised by bjp's diwakar pande and others, who said that even five days after the package was announced the government had not bothered to complete the formality. under the package, the first cash instalment to be paid to a farmer at the time of sale would be 90 per cent of the procurement price instead of the earlier 80 per cent.minister of state for marketing rajendra shingne's reply that a cabinet approval was required before a government resolution could be issued was rejected by the opposition as well as by congress's ranjit deshmukh. they maintained that since the chief minister himself had been involved in the agreement with cotton growers, relevant orders for payment according to the new terms could be issued immediately and the cabinet's endorsement taken post facto. under pressure from the opposition, the minister assured the house that the government resolution would be issued by the end of the day.when the house's attention was drawn to the large-scale devastation of cotton crop in yavatmal and some other districts by the bollworm infestation, agriculture minister rohidas patil announced that gm cotton seeds which were found to be resistant to bollworm could now be used as the government had cleared its import. however, he cautioned the farmers that gm seeds were not totally resistant to the infestation.

6,"Despite laws, water pollution is uncontrolled: CAG","new delhi: in any other country, this would be considered a scandal. despite laws and schemes, rivers in the country are getting dirtier, polluting industries are functioning without much check, sewage is still finding its way into water bodies and the drinking water supplied to towns does not meet set parameters, posing a health risk to residents.the shortcomings are detailed in the latest performance appraisal by the comptroller and auditor-general of india. its report, tabled in parliament on tuesday, looks, in essence, at the implementation of the water (prevention and control of pollution) act, 1974.it found very little implementation of the law. in haryana, 611 of 2,867 polluting units identified were functioning without the mandatory permission. in himachal pradesh, only one of 58 municipal committees/notified area committees had similar permission from the state pollution control board. none of 122 government hospitals or public health centres had even bothered to apply for permission. two industrial units in kangra district had been operating for 10 and 16 years without permission.this was true of just about every state. in karnataka, 6,891 industries needed consent; 2,169 were functioning without it. in maharashtra, 10 of 15 municipal corporations had not even applied for permission. in orissa, none of 102 urban local bodies had consent from the state board. in rajasthan, 1,317 of 1,670 highly polluting units were operating without permission. in gujarat, 30 textile mills and dye-manufacturing units had been operating without consent for periods ranging from six months to 16 years.faced with this barrage, the central pollution control board responsible for implementing the act had little alternative but to direct its boards and committees in july this year to do their job.the dismaying story continues. cag says several states hadn't even managed to identify polluting units and state boards failed to act effectively against industries which didn't install pollution control devices, or use these.states which hadn't even identified all the polluting units were andhra pradesh, gujarat, himachal pradesh, jammu and kashmir, kerala, madhya pradesh, punjab and rajasthan. in tripura, the information collected was ``at wide variance'' with the information in the records of the director of industries and commerce, reportedly because the survey wasn't complete.cag also found fault with state board inspections, describing them as far from satisfactory and saying there were ``significant shortfalls'' in actual inspections of units, as opposed to targets fixed.the nationwide position on sewerage is not much better. ``antiquated and inadequate'' systems and plants cannot cope, so untreated domestic waste is finding its way into water bodies. municipal corporations just don't have the resources for treatment.result: drinking water supplied to towns fails the test. in hyderabad and secunderabad, samples indicated the water was hard and had high fluoride content; the underground pipes were old, had developed fissures and drain water had been entering water supply pipes.in bihar, more than half of patna's urban population was being supplied bacteriologically polluted water through the water supply system since 1998. in ludhiana, jalandhar, amritsar, ropar and nangal in punjab, people were forced to drink contaminated groundwater for want of alternatives. these are just samples: the situation in other states wasn't much different.

7,Terror law: Govt doesn't name banned groups,"new delhi: one week after the vajpayee government invoked its new anti-terrorism law, poto, to ban the peoples war group, maoist communist centre and ""all their affiliated formations and front organisations'', the union home ministry is refusing to specify exactly which groups and organisations have now been banned.asked whether student organisations sympathetic to the pwg's or mcc's ideology would be considered `front organisations' and banned under poto, union minister of state for home affairs i d swami told the times of india, ``only if the police has evidence that the student organisation was supporting the pwg or the mcc in its terrorist activities.'' but he said the home ministry would not give out the names of organisations it considers to be fronts for the pwg and mcc. legal experts say that contrary to swami's assurances, members of these `front organisations' - which could include a students' federation, trade union or cultural troupe - can be jailed for 10 years under poto even if they are not themselves involved in any violent activity. under poto's circular definition, `terrorist activity' includes membership in an organisation the government believes to be terrorist even though it does not formally name the organisation concerned.banning organisations without naming them is patently unconstitutional and provides a lot of scope for the police to misuse the law, say lawyers critical of poto. ``a roving inquiry into all associates is an absurdity. banning affiliated organisations without naming them is peremptory, and wholly arbitrary. it's nothing but a fishing expedition'', says lawyer rajeev dhawan. he asks: ``how can you ban something without giving reasons, without explaining the urgency, without giving details, even a name.''the centre's order last week gave reasons for the ban but did not mention the names of the ``formations and front organisations'' affiliated to the two groups. about pwg, the order said it was formed in 1980 as a conglomerate of seven left-extremist outfits in andhra pradesh and has now emerged as a potent threat to national security with absolute commitment to overthrow the state through violent armed revolution. however, the order makes no mention of the front organisations.swami said one of the reasons the names of the front organisations could not be given out was because ``often front organisations of terrorists change their names to avoid being booked under law''. in the us, the justice department gets around the problem of name-changing by frequently updating its list of terrorist organisations. swami feels, however, that the strategy of not making any names public gives a ``wider opportunity to the security forces to nab such terrorist organisations''.dhawan finds the reasoning absurd. ``how can you ban an organisation without giving it a reason to explain? poto's procedure is illegal. the correct procedure is in the prevention of unlawful activities act 1967, which gives an opportunity to be heard. why can't the government use this act, which was successfully used for the past 34 years, instead of using poto?''

8,Competition to govt stalls at Visakha Utsav,"visakhapatnam: even as the district administration has intensified its efforts to ensure success of the forthcoming visakha utsav, an annual festival to showcase tourism and investment potential of the district to attract more investments, a person is giving a tough time to the authorities. district administration's efforts for letting out stalls being erected on the beach road for the forthcoming visakha utsav appear to be affected by a person who is offering a competitive price if stalls are set up in his premises. it may be recalled that administration has decided to erect 100 stalls to house various trade activities during the four-day visakha utsav-2001 beginning on december 22. income generated by sale of these stalls would be spent for utsav expenditure. however, owner of a private marriage hall on the beach road is coming out with 100 stalls on a war footing in his premises. while utsav organisers put the price of each stall at rs 15,000, a private stall at the marriage hall premises in the same location is priced at rs 5,000 with all infrastructure facilities like power, water etc. interestingly, while the administration with a great difficulty managed to lure 25 people to set up their stalls during the festival more than 50 stalls being installed by the marriage hall owner had already been booked and many others are in the pipeline. though it is mandatory for marriage hall owner to obtain a permission from the civic authorities he did not even applied for one so far, an official of the municipal corporation said. ""why should we opt government stall priced at rs 15,000 while the private party is offering the same stall at cheaper price?"" questioned a trader opening cloth shop in the forthcoming visakha utsav at visakhapatnam.

11,'Thumb rule will check rigging',"hyderabad: the age-old technique of 'finger printing' to firmly establish the identity of a person, may be the solution to prevent impersonation by voters in the elections to the municipal corporation of hyderabad which are in the offing. ""if introduced, this system would bring down rigging by almost one hundred per cent in any election,"" state election commission secretary d r garg said. garg told the times of india, though a decision is yet to be taken for the introduction of using 'thumb impression' identification system in the coming mch elections, its implementation would set a precedence for electoral reforms. no two persons have the same fingerprints, so it would be difficult for the voter to dodge the election commission by voting more than once. the thumb impression would be taken on a sheet of paper and then it would be scanned into the computer.the fingerprint, along with the residential address and other details of the person, would then be stored into the computer. when the same fingerprint is detected again for the second time, the computer will immediately issue an alert. the votes polled by the culprit would then be cancelled and a criminal complaint would be filed against the person in question. garg said earlier on a experimental basis the finger printing technique was introduced at 30 gram panchayats in every district in the state. at one village of guntur district finger prints of the voters were scanned and fed into the computer. this led to the detection of at least 40 people who illegally voted for more than once. the criminal cases were initiated against those 40 people while cancelling their votes, the secretary said. meanwhile, the state election commission has also requested the superintendent of police of every district to carry out the scanning of finger-print impressions from the rest of the gram panchayats also and to initiate action against those found guilty of voting more than once. ""this would instil fear among the illegal voters,"" garg said.

12,Bedlam at all-party meet on MCH polls,"hyderabad: an all-party meeting convened by the municipal corporation of hyderabad (mch) on tuesday to discuss various issues related to elections to the corporation turned into a freefor-all event. the leaders of various political parties shouted and jostled with each other to draw the attention of mch commissioner p k mohanty. however, despite this, there was unity among all the parties in opposing the criteria adopted for enumeration of bcs and finalisation of reservations. congress and telangana rasthra samithi (trs) accused the mch officials of colluding with the ruling telugu desam party (tdp) and walked out of the meeting. senior congress leader p sudhir kumar and pitla krishna said the decisions regarding the reservations were taken unilaterally by the officials. ""the entire process was carried out under the pressure from tdp.the all-party meeting is only an eye wash,"" one of the agitated members said before walking out from the conference hall. trs city-unit president m sudarshan rao accused the officials of favouring the ruling party and joined the congress leaders in the walk out. majlis-e-ittehadul muslimeen (mim) representative and former mla virasat rasool khan on the other hand wanted reservation for minorities.advocating communal reservation, khan asked why 30 of the 35 wards in the four assembly constituencies held by mim were reserved for women, scs and sts, when 80 per cent of the population belonged to the minority community. he said as mim had won in the 1986 mch polls, this time the tdp was conspiring against his party. ""the process is being subverted to harm the interests of the minorities. how can the mallepally division be reserved for a sc candidate where 80 per cent of people are muslims,"" he asked. the majlis bachao tahreeek (mbt) too echoed similar views. when mohanty asked the leaders to approach the state election commission to represent their case, bjp city-unit president chintala ramachandra reddy yelled, ""don't misguide us. when we went to the sec commissioner, he said he had no role to play in finalising reservations.you are the authority and you have to rectify the anomalies."" cpi leader aziz pasha wanted the commissioner to correct the mistakes and enable the election commission to conduct elections at the earliest. bjp mlas prem singh rathore and k laxman and senior tdp leader ravula chandrasekhar reddy were present.

13,Pesticides behind farmers' death: Study,"hyderabad: a study by the centre for resource education (cre), toxiclinks of new delhi and sarvodaya youth organisation, has determined that the cause for deaths of cotton farmers in warangal district in september this year was due to exposure to pesticides. according to cre executive director and international foundation for organic agricultural movement asia board member d narasimha reddy, interviews with family members and doctors' reports show that the farmers died due to exposure to pesticides.the study was carried out in damera, akkampeta and mogilicherla villages. the death of six farmers was reported in september and 10 farmers were admitted to the mahatma gandhi hospital in warangal. in the case of pidugu samaih of atmakur mandal, who died within 12 hours after exposure, the symptoms were uneasiness, giddiness and vomiting - for which the local doctor administered glucose. the farmer was spraying 'curacron' 50 ml diluted in 16 litres of water. samaih, whose wife was questioned, said he had no previous health problems and had been spraying pesticides for past 15 years. in the case of penta kumariah, who died within 24 hours of exposure, the symptoms were uneasiness, giddiness, vomiting and irritation in the eyes. penta kumariah was spraying the pesticide 'profenophous'. in other cases, the symptoms were similar, but pesticides used were quinnalphos, cypermethrin, methyl parathion (metacid) and asataph. farmers are not aware of the ingredients of the pesticides, they do not use gloves or masks. and they spray the pesticides into the wind, narasimha reddy said. pesticide companies increase the potency of the pesticide to make them more effective, he said. he said pesticides used by farmers in the district were wide ranging, hence the possibility of one defective batch in production is ruled out. it is also not possible to find out from where these pesticides are bought as farmers usually do not collect bills. another problem is that often farmers choose a pesticide based on advice from fellow farmers. reddy said there is an urgent need to educate farmers on how to handle pesticides as deaths are reported from other districts every year. deaths can also be due to an accumulation effect over the years. according to ministry of agriculture's directorate of plant protection, the annual consumption of pesticides in andhra is 9,910 tonne, which is the highest in the country.

15,Thackeray assails Pawar's 'compromising' politics,"mumbai: shiv sena supremo bal thackeray has sharply criticised ncp president sharad pawar, who is celebrating his 61st birthday on wednesday, accusing him of adopting double standards and claiming that he had failed to make his mark in national politics despite having calibre. thackeray's observations about pawar appeared in wednesday's editorial of his party mouthpiece saamna even as political leaders of every hue from across the nation are expected to converge at the sprawling mahalaxmi turf club here this evening to greet the maratha strongman. ""pawar's past clearly establishes his double standards and, he, despite having calibre and capacity, has failed to make a mark in national politics,"" the editorial said. as an opposition leader pawar had excellent rapport with him, thackeray recalled in the editoral and said he had shared the dais with the latter. the sena chief also recounted the day when pawar had attended the first public meeting held to announce the formation of shiv sena. pawar, while floating his ncp two years ago, had vowed to remain equidistant from bjp and congress, the editorial reminded. however, it said, the maratha leader was sharing power with congress in maharashtra and was hobnobbing with the bjp. the saamna editorial recounts pawar's on and off relationship with congress, his showering praise on sonia gandhi in the initial days and later criticising her foreign origin. the editorial took a dig at pawar, saying that ""birthday celebrations of national-level leaders assume country-wide significance if they are celebrated in national capital of new delhi."" ""those who aspire to be national leaders should think of future and march ahead. but pawar wants to be the prime minister and chief minister of maharashtra at the same time,"" thackeray remarked in the editorial.

21,New rent rules from <br>December 31,"bangalore: landlords, wathc out. the new rent rules are ready. they will come into effect from december 31. this is courtesy the state government's spanking new karnataka rent rules 2001, through power exercised under the karnataka rent act 1999. it will come into effect from december 31 when the old rules expire. the rules were framed in the light of the amended karnataka rent control getting the president's assent last week. the most important of these is that all tenants and landlords will have to file their tenancy agreements, or returns, within a period of 90 days, in a prescribed form. extension of the 90-day deadline will be under the discretion of the rent controller and penal provisions will be invoked in case of non-compliance. as for curbing the practice of dodging income tax by fixing very low rent on the structure and hiking rent on fixtures, the rules specify that amount paid on these items should not exceed 15 per cent of the rent, while maintenance costs should not exceed 10 per cent of the rent. things included in the list for which a landlord can charge rent under the specified 15 per cent are air-conditioner, heater, water cooler, geyser, refrigerator, cooking range, furniture, exclusive garden, exclusive playground and any other facilities provided. in order to bring in uniformity for fixation of standard rent, revision, enhancement and deemed rent, the rules provide for approval and registration of valuers. accordingly, any civil or architectural engineer with five years of experience as a valuer is eligible to register as a valuer. a landlord or tenant will have to apply in triplicate in the prescribed form for change in rent after which it will be referred to a valuer who will inspect and verify the application request on payment of valuation charges. to facilitate accountability, middlemen, brokers and estate agents will have to register themselves with the rent controller concerned through payment of rs 200 who has the right to remove names if he has just cause for doing so. ``our rules are much better than the delhi rent control act which has resulted in heated debates. they are intended to strike a balance between the tenant and landlord,'' law department sources said. ``however, as rents are high in the city they will not be affected. but in interior parts of the state, where rents are very low, we expect some rationalisation to take place with the implementation of these rules,'' they added.

22,Congress leaders stay away from DCC president’s rally,"pathankot: despite a good turnout of party workers, the congress rally organised here as a show of strength by dcc president raghunath sahai puri proved to be a lacklustre affair as none of the party stalwarts from the centre or chandigarh could join it. puri, who is understood to have been assured of attendance by ambika soni, motilal vora and ppcc president amarinder singh had to be content with the presence of lesser leaders like ppcc vice president dr kewal krishan, half a dozen ex-mlas and dcc office bearers to charge the crowd. even former mp and senior congress leader sukhbans kaur bhinder and her husband ps bhinder could not make it to the rally. while aicc president sonia gandhi's iftar party was cited as the reason for the absence of central leaders, puri and other party workers were left nursing a hurt as the rally was aimed at promoting him as a prospective candidate from sujanpur against the bjp candidate, it minister satya pal saini. according to political observers, whatever the reasons for senior central and state leaders' staying away, their absence had sent a wrong signal to partymen and certainly was a setback to the party campaign in the state. insiders say it could be a deliberate attempt by senior leaders not to associate with the function as this would have conveyed the idea that puri was the final choice of the party for sujanpur constituency, while there were eight other candidates in the fray and the party was yet to begin the screening process. meanwhile, a large number of followers of aicc intellectual cell chairman ashwini kumar, led by advocate rajbir singh, another serious contender for the congress ticket from sujanpur constituency, left for delhi to meet sonia gandhi on wednesday.
