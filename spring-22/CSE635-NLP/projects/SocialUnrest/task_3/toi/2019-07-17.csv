0,LPG blasts baffle riot investigators,"AHMEDABAD: Whether the recent riots in Gujarat were pre-planned or spontaneous is a debate which will go on for a long time, but investigators probing the riot-related cases are struck by the widespread use of cooking gas cylinders in blowing up places of worship, factories, houses and other business establishments throughout the state.

What is surprising is that never before has gas cylinders been put to such deadly use. How did mobs in Ahmedabad, Vadodara, Himmatnagar, Halol and Mehsana think almost simultaneously along similar lines, ask many investigators.

The question has been dogging many independent police officials who are trying to establish a pattern behind the riots. A senior police official now connected with the investigations said, â€œMobs across the state could not have been communicating to each other advising the rioters on the effective use of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) cylinders. There was also no precedent in Gujarat to set an example to follow.â€™â€™

Besides, say investigators, using an LPG cylinder for destruction is something that does not come so easily to everybody. This means that there is a possibility that some persons have been trained in the job beforehand. Not only were these cylinders used to set on fire several premises, they were also used to break open huge gates and doors to enable the mobs to make an entry into shops and godowns.

The innocuous cylinders turned into a deadly explosive with the turn of the regulator and a strike of a match. The explosion was unmatched as the flames burst through thick sheets of metal which turned into deadly splinters.

The worst example was seen at the Gulbarg Society in Meghaninagar. Here this improvised bomb was used to set 39 people and their homes aflame on February 28. Dhanasuthar ni Pol in Kalupur, Naroda Gam, Noorani Masjid and Naroda-Patia also fell prey to LPG-fuelled fires.

The owner of a city-based LPG gas agency said, â€œI have outlets in many sensitive areas and am still struggling to account for many cylinders that went missing during the recent riots.â€™â€™

But, even if one presumes that mobs in Naroda and around were acting in cohesion, investigators find it difficult to explain how LPG bottles were rocking Mehsana, Vadodara and Panchmahals at the same time. At Mehsana, on March 1, a cylinder was used to blow up a place of worship in Unava.

Police sources say that a similar modus operandi was used in Visnagar to burn and kill 11 persons and damage a place of worship. Former Vadodara deputy commissioner of police Piyush Patel said cylinders were used to trigger off blasts and fires at Khatri Mohalla in Panigate, Makarpura, Tarsali and Salatwada. In Halol town of Panchmahals, at least two hotels on the bypass were burnt using LPG cylinders.

Officials in the Vadodara city police said that the use of LPG was unprecedented. â€œIn the earlier riots, such use of LPG cylinders was not witnessed. This time rioters took advantage of their easy availability and massive destructive power.â€™â€™

1,Ministers oppose school fee based on income,"MUMBAI: After parents and MLAs, itâ€™s the turn of ministers in the Democratic Front government to oppose the stateâ€™s decision to hike fees in aided- English medium schools.

At a meeting called by school minister Ramakrishna More on Tuesday to discuss the fee hike, at least three ministers are learnt to have opposed the new income-based fee structure. According to school education secretary Jairaj Phatak, the ministers and MLAs said that the hike was â€œexorbitantâ€™â€™ and suggested new methods by which fees could be collected.

These suggestions would be placed before chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh for a decision by the cabinet, a senior official in the school education department said. â€œIt may not come up at Wednesdayâ€™s cabinet meeting, but it will be placed before the cabinet this month,â€™â€™ he added.

The ministers who attended the meet include minister of state for home Kripashankar Singh, minister of state for housing Nawab Malik, minister of state for health Eknath Gaikwad and minister of state for food and civil supplies Naseem Khan, while MLAs Baba Siddique and Suresh Shetty were also present.

A minister who attended the meeting said that ever since the income-based fee structure was introduced, there had been many complaints. Only last week, parents and students organised a massive demonstration near Azad Maidan, blocking traffic for several hours.

The minister, who requested anonymity, said that â€œeveryone opposed the scheme at the meetingâ€™â€™. Under the present scheme, students whose parents earn more than Rs 50,000 per annum will be charged fees, beginning at Rs 100 per month.

â€œThis fee structure will create discrimination among students and make them conscious of being rich or poor. Therefore, we suggested that uniform fees should be recovered from everyone,â€™â€™ another minister who attended the meeting said.

It is learnt that the ministers suggested a fee hike starting at a monthly common charge of Rs 5 for Std I students, Rs 10 for Std II, Rs 15 for Std III and so on. â€œThis is a tentative proposal,â€™â€™ said a minister, adding that he had also suggested that those earning below Rs 50,000 per annum should be kept out of the purview of the fee hike.

Earlier, Congress MP Sunil Dutt, along with a delegation of MLAs, had met Mr Deshmukh demanding that the fee hike be reversed.

2,PWP will not join govt again: Patil,"PUNE: Warning the Vilasrao Deshmukh government not to take the Peasants and Workers Party (PWP) party for granted, senior leader N.D. Patil on Sunday said the party would not join the Democratic Front (DF) or the state cabinet again.

Addressing a press conference at the end of a two-day party conclave here, Mr Patil said the PWP had decided to maintain a distance from the ruling Democratic Front and the BJP- Shiv Sena combine.

Mr Patil said the five MLAs belonging to the PWP will not shy away from voting against the government in case any issue demands such an action. â€œThe party legislators will vote according to the merit of the issue without bothering about the consequences,â€™â€™ he said.

Mr Patil said the PWP could not be blamed for the political crisis in the state last month as the DF government had a majority even after the party had withdrawn its support.

â€œThe leaders the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) had gone on record stating that the exit of the PWP from the DF combine was a set- back, but would not affect the stability of the government,â€™â€™ he said.

Justifying the withdrawal of the partyâ€™s support to the government, Mr Patil said the Congress and the NCP had become complacent about several important issues relating to farmers and development matters.

He said the two major partners in the ruling Front never bothered to take his party into confidence while taking important policy decisions. â€œWe came to know about the increase in water surcharge, labour law amendments and the hike in rates of ration for the below poverty line people through newspapers or independent sources outside the government,â€™â€™ he said.

The party decided to withdraw its support after it found out the unofficial alliance stuck by the NCP with the Shiv Sena in the Raigadh zilla parishad (ZP) polls to defeat the candidates of the PWP, said Mr Patil.

In reply to a query, he said the PWPâ€™s decision to stay out of the government did not revolve round the inclusion or exclusion of NCPâ€™s Sunil Tatkare from the cabinet. â€œHad that been the case, the PWP would have joined the DF government since Tatkare is out of the cabinet now,â€™â€™ he said.

The PWP holds Mr Tatkare responsible for conspiring to defeat its candidate in the Raigad ZP presidentâ€™s election. Even the Congress had formed an alliance with the communal parties at various ZPs in the state, he said.

â€œMaharashtra pradesh Congress committee (MPCC) president Govindrao Adik told us quite unabashedly that his party had a policy to stay away from the communal parties only at the state level,â€™â€™ said Mr Patil. The PWP leader said he had a letter from Mr Adik contending that the Congress workers at the taluka level had been given a free hand to tie up with any locally strong party.

Mr Patil, who had led the crusade against the energy giant, Enron, for selling power to the Maharashtra state electricity board (MSEB) at an exorbitant cost, said the government should not increase its offer for buying power from the defunct Dabhol Power Company (DPC).

The PWP leader, a former chairman of the governmentâ€™s co-ordination committee, said he had given a suggestion to Mr Deshmukh to sign a new power purchase agreement (PPA) with a company that buys DPC from its creditors.

â€œIn such a case, the Maharashtra government totally gets over with the DPC as the deal will be inked with a new company,â€™â€™ he said.

4,AP govt extends ban on PWG,"HYDERABAD: The Andhra Pradesh government has extended the ban on the People''s War Group (PWG) by another year, a decision that is likely to cast a shadow on the ongoing dialogue process.

The decision to extend the ban, with retrospective effect from June 22 when the ban lapsed, was taken at a cabinet meeting chaired by Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Hyderabad on Monday.

The move comes in the backdrop of growing mutual distrust between the PWG and state government in the wake of recent police encounters in Karimnagar and Warangal districts in which five extremist leaders were killed.

""Though we are ready to carry forward peace talks, we cannot remain silent spectators to the continued violence by Naxalites,"" official sources said.

Naidu, who had taken the initiative to start a dialogue with the outlawed outfit, had recently gone on record saying peace and armed struggle could not go together and had reiterated his appeal to the extremist group to lay down their arms to facilitate a conducive atmosphere for talks.

5,Bihar to have new industrial policy,"PATNA: The state government would announce new industrial policy during next three months, said minister for industries, Vishwamohan Sharma, while replying to a discussion on the topic â€˜Industry in successor Bihar: problems and solutionsâ€™ in the state legislative council here on Tuesday.

He also said that all the recommendations of Irani Commission would be included in the new industrial policy.

While replying to a short notice question of BJP member, Giriraj Singh minister for small scale industries, Ravindra Charan Yadav informed the house that 30,413 small industries and 28 big and medium-scale industries of the state have fallen sick.

Yadav said that the union government undertaking Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI) has not financed even a single sick industrial unit during the financial year 1997-98, 1998-99 and 1999-2000. However; he said that the state government has been trying its best for revival of the sick industrial units of the state.

Sharma also said the state government has ambitious plan for industrial development which also includes revival of sick units and setting up of agro-based industries across the state. He said that two sick jute mills of Katihar have already been started and government has started working on setting up five industrial growth centres across the state. Both the small-scale industries minister and the minister for industries demanded special package for the state which was proposed after creation of Jharkhand.

However, BJP member, Saryu Rai making specific allegation of state government being engaged in demagogy on industrial development of the state. He said the state government has allocated only 7 percent fund on industries in its budget which exposes government''s claim.

6,TDP leaders fault govt on power front,"HYDERABAD: Leaders of the Telugu Desam Party and the state unit of the BJP feel that the government was adopting a bureaucratic style of reaction rather than face the Opposition onslaught on power politically.

Talking to The Times of India, some leaders, who have been listed to speak on the issue of power shortage in the state in the Assembly on Wednesday, expressed the feeling that instead of trying to put up a posture of being offensive but giving defensive replies, the government, the party, and the MLAs should have gone to the people and told them, â€œYes,we do have a power problem. The following are the reasons, but it was because of prudent management that the situation in the state is still much better as compared to other states.â€�

It should have also announced scheduled power cuts and adhered to it. This would have made people understand the situation better.

But unfortunately, the party and the government had been harping on one slogan. â€œWe are in a better situation than other states.â€� This does not gel well with the common man or the farmer.

The local MLA and the minister should have gone to the people and put the cards clear on the table and should have sought the cooperation of the people, they say.

Instead of communicating with the common man, the onus of making statements on power had been left to chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu. On top of it, the government, in its enthusiasm, announced that it would supply uninterrupted power supply from August 15.

This, according to a leader from the coastal belt, may not be possible in view of the failure of rainfall.

7,Gulzar pained by increasing communal violence,"MUMBAI: Like the post-Godhra mayhem in Gujarat, all communal riots have similar tales of tragedy but everytime there is a new dimension to the violence, noted lyricist and film-maker Gulzar said here on Tuesday.

""Not only Gujarat, during all communal riots there is a new dimension,"" Gulzar told reporters on the occasion of special staging of Kharashen (the scars from riots, a collage of Gulzar''s famous literary creations based on the theme of communal amity.

The noted Bollywood personality said the 1947 riots still haunted him and ""the scars have really never healed.""

""For 25 years since 1947 riots, I used to be haunted by nightmarish dreams... they still haunt me,"" he said.

""Even today the slogans of Jai Bajrang and Allah ho Akbar haunt me, ""Said the ace writer, who had once described his fleeing from Pakistan with famous oneliner "" woh (Pakistan) watan tha yeh (India) desh hai "".

It is for the first time, a group of theatre personalities under director Salim Arif has come out with the idea of staging 75-minute show Kharashen .

"" Kharashen will include staging of three plays penned by Gulzar Hilsa , Khauf and Khuda Hafij ,"" Salim Arif said.

8,S Africa tries saving development summit,"NEW DELHI: In a last-ditch effort to rescue the upcoming World Summit on Sustainable Development from almost certain failure, the host, South Africa has invited 25 countries - alongwith India - to help resolve differences ahead of the August-end meeting in Johannesburg.

The first meeting of the â€˜Friends of the Chair'', to be held in New York on Wednesday, will try and find an approach or mechanism to facilitate negotiations in Johannesburg.

A failed, final preparatory meeting held in Bali a month ago, saw the officials in Delhi viewing the Johannesburg Summit as ""a damage control exercise"" rather than one which would see countries working together for a better, common future.

The meeting failed to resolve the major issues of timebound commitments, concrete means of implementation and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities - the latter an acknowledgement of unequal situations and relations between countries.

The divide between the developed and developing countries was clearly on resources, funds and capacity building.

9,Pak wants to sabotage J&K polls: Farooq,"SRINAGAR: Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Dr Farooq Abdullah on Wednesday accused Pakistan of trying to sabotage the ensuing assembly elections in the state by engineering killings of elected representatives including Panches and Sarpanches.

Intervening during zero-hour in the assembly, Abdullah said several areas in border districts are infested by militants and they have instructions from Islamabad not to allow the election process to succeed.

Some opposition members had voiced concern over the killings of Panches and Sarpanches by militants in the border areas and demanded adequate security for them.

Unidentified militants had killed a Sarpanch in Doda district on Monday night.

Asking MLAs and other elected representatives to take extra care and stick to the security norms, the Chief Minister said militants may strike against them to create a fear psychosis with a view to disrupt the elections, dates for which are coming nearer.

Abdullah asserted the government has taken several measures to foil the militants'' evil designs and disclosed that more Village Defence Committees would be formed and the security pickets in militancy-infested areas would be further strengthened to keep the ultras at bay.

""We do not want to see people get killed and aspire for help from God Almighty"", he said, adding people should learn to take care of themselves.

However, he said, once the elections are over, militant activities will also recede.

10,Shekhawat prefers unanimous election,"NEW DELHI: Former Rajasthan Chief Minister Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, who is the NDA''s nominee for Vice Presidentship, on Wednesday said it would be preferable if the nominees for the two Constitutional posts - President and Vice President - were elected unanimously by political parties.

""It will send a good signal if the President and Vice President are apolitical and elected unanimously"", Shekhawat told reporters at Rajasthan House.

A steady stream of visitors and well wishers was there to greet the veteran Rajasthan politician, hours before his name was to be officially announced by the NDA leadership for the Vice President''s post.

Asked to comment on opposition parties wanting to field a candidate against him though he had the support of NDA, Shekhawat, a three time Chief Minister, said a good message would go if he was elected unanimously.

To a question whether other names had been floated for the post, he said he was hopeful that only his name would be announced.

To another question whether BJP was wanting to utilise his service in the Rajya Sabha where the ruling party was in a minority, Shekhawat said it was not correct to say that he could cobble up a majority for the ruling party in the Upper House.

He said he would strive to achieve the goal of Upper House taking up discussions which would be ultimately beneficial to the people.

15,"Desperate farmers turn to generators, diesel engines","LUDHIANA: Farmers of the bet area of Ludhiana district, where the problem of waterlogging had existed about four years ago, are now facing the problem of a fast receding ground water level, courtesy the delay in the arrival of monsoon. Gripped with the fear of a likely crop failure in case the rains are further delayed, the farmers, desperate to save their crop, have reportedly turned to generators and diesel engines to meet their irrigation requirements, thereby jacking up the cost of cultivation.The bet area comprises about 30 villages where paddy is the main crop. Farmers of this area feel that the present eight-hour power supply is insufficient. The cost of per acre diesel consumption has reportedly reached an alarming level. As the water level has gone down, farmers have even started deepening the bores as a long-term plan to meet such a situation in the future.Not to speak of small farmers, the worsening situation has affected big farmers too, who are feeling the pinch of high costs. Shamsher Singh Gill of Garah village who has 10 tubewells said that the problem of insufficient power supply warranted the use of diesel engines to operate tubewells. ''Besides, I need two generators to irrigate the paddy crop spread in acres of land. The water level has drastically gone down from about 15 feet to 22 feet now. order to meet the irrigation needs, I have been spending about Rs 3,500 per acre on diesel operating engines and generators, he said, adding that given the high labour cost, which about Rs 700 per acre, the total cost is bound be much higher.Throwing light on another problem, Anil who runs a shop selling fertilisers and pesticides in Nurpur Bet, said that due to the prevailing conditions, farmers are forced to more pesticides as the crop has been infested with stem borer and leaf folder diseases. About the extent of the problem, Vij said that although it was at an initial stage and controllable, the cost of cultivation might go up if rains are further delayed. Jagdeep Singh Grewal of Bhattian village, who sowed 35 acres land, said that the panic among farmers could be gauged from the fact that many of them his area had already gone for deep boring.

17,Drought increases demand for foodgrains,"CHANDIGARH: This time around if there is no rain or little of it, the long-term interest of the Punjab farmer may be furthered by an unintended effect: drought elsewhere will increase the demand for foodgrains produced in the state where the granaries are overflowing and the farmerâ€™s bumper produce represents a problem for the state government that has to run around to get the money to buy it.

â€œWe expect the movement of grain stocks from Punjab to other parts of India to increase significantly if the situation persists and in any case by October one we will have 20 lakh metric tonnes (LMT) of storage space available for storing fresh stocks of paddy to be procured in the state,â€� the senior regional manager of the Punjab region of Food Corporation of India (FCI), VK Singh, told Times News Network. In June, FCI moved around 7.9 LMT of rice from Punjab, the lowest amount the balance paddy from last two years lying with various state procurement agencies of Punjab stands at roughly three LMT.

At another level, the non-existent monsoon has vindicated that the agriculture driven growth model being followed in the state may be expensive in terms of the costs imposed on the entire country but it is also vital for national food security: This year the monsoon may be deficient only, but the prospect of a bad crop is already giving jitters to the Union government. Will the Union agriculture ministry talk of crop diversification in these days? The state government had emphasised this point before the central highlevel committee on long-term foodgrain policy and in its response to the Centreâ€™s proposal on agricultural support programme for farm income protection. The problem, as understood in official circles here, is that other states of the country, which mainly consume rice, have become self-sufficient in paddy crop. They, however, add that these states grow enough grain only on a year-to-year basis and do not have any buffer stocks to meet emergent situations like the one being experienced now.

â€œIn Madhya Pradesh, the soybean crop has been wiped out and in Uttar Pradesh, the fate of the paddy crop in 58 districts is uncertain. The country has stocks from Punjab to fall back upon. Just one bad monsoon and the Centre will stop asking Punjab to diversify to other crops,â€� a principal secretary to the state government. At the moment Punjab has approximately 150 lakh metric tonnes of wheat stored in its granaries. This figure is for the wheat stocks with the state government and excludes the stock lying with the FCI.

18,Revenue officials bring Punjab govt to knees,"BATHINDA: It was meant to be a grand exercise to eradicate corruption in Punjab. Starting from Punjab Public Service Commission (PPSC), the new chief minister seemed to be more than eager to stem out the big banyan tree of corruption.

But once the all-powerful vigilance department started taking action against the revenue department of the state this month, the widespread agitation by the revenue officials against the move brought the government to its knees. The revenue department is one of the government departments in the state which are notorious for corruption.

On Tuesday, chief minister Amarinder Singh assured the protesting revenue officials that their offices would be raided only after taking the deputy commissioner into confidence. The chief minister reportedly regretted the inconvenience caused to the officials following the vigilance raid.

With the revenue officials on a statewide strike for the last one week to protest against the vigilance move, the already the state has further deteriorated. The other worrisome fallout is that the revenue officials have decided to come in direct confrontation with the vigilance department by exposing the ill-gotten wealth and property of the vigilance officials.

The state government is perturbed and wants to defuse the tension between the two departments. On Monday, the state chief secretary called a delegation of Punjab Revenue Officers Association and arranged a meeting between them and the chief minister on Tuesday.

According to the vigilance department sources, during the last five years, the maximum cases of corruption were registered against revenue officials in the state. During 1997, 1998, 1999 and 2000, the number of revenue officials caught red handed accepting bribes was 38, 42, 31 and 18 respectively. Out of a total of 707 cases registered under the Prevention of Corruption Act during these four years, 129 cases were against the revenue officials only.
