1,PM was given incomplete line to inaugurate,"danapur: even after a week of inauguration of the newly electrified mainline section between patna and mughalsarai by prime minister atal bihari vajpayee, the railways are not able to streamline the supply of traction power on this section of the eastern railwayâ€™s danapur division. frequent breakdowns in the supply of traction power are a common feature these days as a result of which the only memu train running between patna and mughalsarai has been getting delayed for hours every day. sources said that though this section has been declared open for memu, various works relating to electrification are still going on. for instance, sectioning work, which is more important for normal operation of electric trains on this route, is yet to be completed. unless it is given priority, more and more electric trains cannot be run on the patna-mughalsarai section, the sources maintained. on condition of anonymity, a railway official at danapur said that everything was done in haste as the pm was to inaugurate the newly electrified section. thus, several important works were left unfinished at the time of its inauguration, he observed, adding that commissioner of railway safety (crs) mahesh chand did not permit movement of any electric train on this route beyond the speed of 50 kmph for safety reasons. according to the sources, the crs has asked the railways to complete the pending electrification works at the earliest so that normal operation of electric trains could be maintained on this route. looplines of the particular section between ara and buxar are yet to be electrified. electric passenger trains cannot run smoothly unless the looplines are fully electrified, the sources said. when contacted, senior divisional electrical engineer (traction) a k shukla admitted that the memu is running with full caution due to various incomplete electrification works between the ara and mughalsarai stations of the division. he, however, expressed the hope that functioning of the electrified section will become normal and fully operational by the end of the current month. he said there is no paucity of staff, including trained electric train drivers, for running and maintaining electric passenger trains in the division. meanwhile, the general manager of the central organisation for railway electrification, allahabad, a k chopra, expressed satisfaction over the completion of the work between patna and mughalsarai in record time. from august 2001 to january 2002. he said normal functioning of the traction on this route will be possible soon. according to chopra, the railways proposed electrification of 2,300 route km under the ninth plan out of which 2,165 route km has been electrified so far in the country.

2,Badaun prefers caste to development,"badaun: ramadin shakya, a resident of usehat swears that he has not received right prices for his agricultural produce. he rues that the roads are bad, electricity plays truant and health services are in a shambles. for him, the government has failed to do its job. but, still he has decided to vote for bhagwan singh shakya, a lok janshakti candidate and, a minister in the rajnath singh cabinet only because â€˜mantrijiâ€™ belongs to his caste. â€˜can i go against my jaatiâ€™, he asked. others around him, at a tea stall in the market place, agree in unison. the caste (jaati) and not development would play a decisive role in this backward and crime-prone constituency. badaun district is the largest district in the rohilkhand area touching boundaries with nine other districts. the area is a haven for kidnappers as the villages in kachali region, connecting badaun and etah, are used for hiding the kidnapped persons till the payment of ransom. badaun comprises eight constituencies, where the samajwadi party holds sway. this is evident from the fact that mulayam singh yadav had won his last assembly elections from sahaswan in 1996 by a margin of over 53,000 votes. the neighbouring constituency of bilsi had been bahujan samaj party vice-president mayawatiâ€™s â€˜karma sthaliâ€™. she too had won the last elections by a margin of over 5,000 votes. big names like sharad yadav, salim sherwani and even swami chinmayanand have represented the parliamentary constituency of badaun. sharad yadav was the textile minister when this region voted him to power, said mukesh singh and added that he did nothing for the region. parmanand tiwari, a teacher in a primary school in badaun, said people were not craving for development. â€œpeople want to support a leader having a clout in the police so that they can come handy during crisisâ€�, he said. badaun, though a criminal belt, is regarded as the granary of up. the two weekly markets â€”one in myau and other in ujhwaniâ€” are quite famous. even the traders from the western up visit the market in search of merchandise. the belt has the potential of becoming the cabbage bowl of the state and badaunâ€™s gobhi can be found even in kathmanduâ€™s vegetable market, said babloo gupta, a trader who deals in granary. â€œthe only thing badaun needs is a bit of planning, political will and broad gauge line. if we get these three things, then badaun will changeâ€�, said gupta. but, common voters are least interested in them. they are more concerned about their naak and jaati instead of roads and power. â€œwe are not happy with basic amenities. but, we cannot earn the wrath of mantrjiâ€�, said shakya. so, the bottom line is that in badaun, people would sacrifice development for the sake of caste.

3,‘Back SP for development’,"lucknow: samajwadi party president mulayam singh yadav addressed three meetings on monday in support of the party candidates. the meetings held late in the evening were in support of sharda pratap shukla who is contesting from cantonment, ram kishore yadav who is contesting from sarojini nagar and banwari lal kanchal who is the party candidate from lucknow central. the content of yadavâ€™s speech at all the three places was on similar lines and in conformity with the party manifesto. addressing the meets at maikulal inter college in telibagh, bada chauhara in sadar and e block rajajipuram, the sp chief appealed to all sections of the society to vote for the sp, if they desired the development of the state, their city and their locality. addressing the people who had gathered to hear him, yadav said his party was committed to the welfare of the traders, the youth, unemployed, the minorities and the farmers. he said if the trading community went through the partyâ€™s manifesto then there would be scarcely any member who would not vote for the sp. he reiterated his partyâ€™s commitment to put an end to the â€˜mafia rajâ€™ and the â€˜goonda taxâ€™ being taken from the traders. appealing to the youth, yadav said if voted to power, his government would ensure employment to all failing which it would give employment allowance to the unemployed. he said a question frequently asked was from where his government would get the resources to give the allowance. the sp chief said he intended keeping his ministry small, unlike the present dispensation which had over 90 ministers and around 200 people heading nigams and other similar organisations. the money thus saved would be diverted towards the unemployment allowance. speaking about the anti-farmer policies of the bjp government, yadav said if the farming community was not strong, the urban segment would automatically become weak. hence it was imperative that the uplift of the farmers be kept in mind and his party was committed towards the same. the sp leader also spoke about terrorism and poto and said no dialogue should be held with pakistan till such time as it puts an end to the cross border terrorism. yadav would be addressing meetings at maulviganj, akbarigate and aminabad crossing on wednesday.

4,‘Nothing is impossible in politics’,"kumhrawan: the mp chief minister digvijay singh does not believe in mincing words. â€œnothing is impossible in politics,â€� he said in response to a query whether congress would go in for a post-election alliance with the samajwadi party. talking to times news network on tuesday, singh said he would not rule out anything. â€œbut it is a little premature to make such announcements... let the poll results be out and then the working committee will decide,â€� he added. predicting revival of the party, singh sounded highly optimistic of its bright chances at the hustings. â€œthings have definitely improved a lot as compared to the last general elections,â€� he said claiming that the congressâ€™ seat tally in the state would definitely touch the three-digit mark this time. â€œthe masses today are disillusioned with the casteist and communal politics. they have tried various combinations and the experience has made them bitter and wiser. it is time for them to come back to the pavilion and vote for stability which only congress can offer,â€� he elaborated. reacting to the charges of a lacklustre congress campaign due to absence of priyanka, singh said: â€œpriyanka is not a fulltime politician. she is a housewife. how can she be forced to do something. the party will always welcome her if she wants to but at the same time the decision will be entirely hers.â€�

""either the revenue officials have gone mad or they are not aware of the law,"" he alleged. rao said that every person belonging to backward class was sentimentally attached to jaladrusyam as it was the centre of bc movement. ""is it because of bapuji''s backward class origin or his association with telangana reasons for his family''s eviction from the premises?"" he questioned. stating that the ntr studio, the anr timber depot and the ntr trust bhavan were constructed on government lands and later handed over to the concerned persons, he said the government should allow bapuji to take possession of the site on the same lines.

13,ESMA fails to deter striking Kerala govt staff,"thiruvananthapuram: the kerala government began executing the essential services maintenance act (esma) on tuesday, even as violence broke out in many places between the protagonists and the antagonists of the ongoing indefinite strike by government employees against chief minister a.k. antony''s austerity measures. for the first time, the police arrested six officials, four in thrissur, one in eranakulam, and one in thiruvananthapuram district, under esma. elsewhere, the police arrested 18 persons for violating various laws. a random survey of 10 departments conducted by the police intelligence wing showed that the threat of esma had not worked. the presence of employees was barely 19.19 per cent on tuesday in spite of the cm''s warning on monday that officials from under secretary upwards would be held under the act if they did not report on duty. those who reported consisted mainly secretaries, heads of departments and casual hands. meanwhile, clashes were reported from several places in the state. a parent teacher association (pta) chief of a kannur school was beaten up by the strike sympathisers. private school buses came under attack in chengannur, kozhikode and thiruvananthapuram. in thiruvananthapuram, a gang, said to be backing the strike, entered the st.mary''s school and the government girls school and indulged in violence, breaking furniture and equipment. in yet another incident, the husband of a teacher of the thiruvananthapuram deaf and dumb school was beaten up by the strikers gathered near the school when he reached there on a scooter to drop his wife.

14,Cheap Chinese yarn a bigger worry than polls in Varanasi,"varanasi: in colonial times, the figure of the â€˜â€˜bigoted julahaâ€™â€™, the weaver of the east, was the object of much administrative anxiety and fear. today, more than half a century later, the prejudices of the raj live on but in benaras, the condition of the estimated three-lakh-strong momin or ansari community is no different in other respects too. in the bari of varanasi (north), the sense of claustrophobia is physical â€” rows upon rows of ill-lit rooms, opening on to lanes that are sometimes three feet wide. but the siege is psychological too. despite the presence of two familiar local community faces, none of the boys at the loom is happy interacting with a stranger from delhi. in contrast is the rest of varanasi, where even a casual polite exchange can escalate into a free-wheeling discourse â€” whether the subject is politics, philosophy or religion. hindu benaras is hardly a picture of prosperity, but it possesses a great wealth of opinion and the license to express it. the forced speech of the young men and boys in bari bazar is a striking counterpoint. as in other traditional occupations in the north, the muslims of benaras occupy the lowest rung in the saree business. most weavers are dependent for raw material and credit on the gaddidar, who is usually not one of his own. this absence of autonomy has been made worse by the current market slump where the introduction of sarees made of cheaper synthetic alternatives to silk, has made the famed benarasi silk saree an indulgence for all but a handful. twenty-two-year-old rehman (name changed) and his mates blame the powerloom and the influx of cheap imported chinese yarn for the communityâ€™s economic woes: from falling wages to shrinking work hours. the free availability of the cheaper yarn under ogl, they argue, has made the indian silk industry more competitive, at home and abroad. the real culprit is the craze for cheap counterfeits that sell at one-fifth the price of genuine, hand-woven silk. at 11 a.m., the one prominently functioning school in the jaitpura area of bari bazar is a madrasa, where education means little more than endless religious perorations. advocate tanvir ahmed siddiqui, who practices criminal law nearby, sounds almost despondent: â€˜â€˜what hope is there for young muslim boys when they have nowhere to go: no modern education, no job opportunities. they need modern community schools within easy access because they are too fearful to go to schools in hindu areas. politically, the weavers are prisoners of their faith; disempowered subjects of cynical minority politics. this time around, among the main political parties, the congress alone has put up an ansari candidate in benaras. but given the state of the party, the weavers of varanasi (north) will vote for the qureish (butcher) candidate from samajwadi party, in the unlikely hope that he might still beat the bjp. either way, they will not get the schools or the jobs.

15,Ansari’s arrest fails to stir UP police,"lucknow: while the kolkata, patna and ahmedabad police are smug about the arrest of aftab ansari alias farhan malik, the uttar pradesh police have not given a fig at all despite the fact that the don belongs to varanasi. ironically, even his confessions to the cbi about his modules in agra, varanasi, gorakhpur and the state capital were not enough to wake them from their slumber. dgp r k pandit confirmed that a team was yet to be sent from up to seek remand of aftab or serve a warrant to bring him to the state. the special task force dittoes that. the lucknow and varanasi police, which have kidnapping cases against aftab, have not moved either. aftab and his mentor dinesh thakur are wanted by the lucknow police in connection with the kidnapping of rajendra, son of a prominent businessman of aminabad, from wazirganj in 1992. the varanasi police want aftab for abducting anand agarwal, who was kept in a house in lucknow before being released on payment of ransom. aftab, it is understood, has told the cbi that his brother anwar has invested in real estate in lucknow. he is learnt to have given information about his modules and contacts in varanasi, agra, gorakhpur and lucknow. he has also revealed that his gang had hidden arms and ammunition in the hostels of bhu. but all this information, which could have been used to arrest aftabâ€™s associates active in the state, is lying stagnant with the cbi. reports confirmed that teams from rajkot in rajasthan, bihar, west bengal and gujarat have already reached delhi to put forward their cases involving malik. while the gujarat police are pursuing malikâ€™s remand in connection with the kidnapping of diamond merchant bhasker parekh, the kolkota police have already got a seven-day transit remand in connection with the shooting incident at the american center in the city and the kidnapping of shoe baron p r burman. the rajasthan police are seeking remand of aftab in connection with a gun running racket in which one of aftabâ€™s associates, asif, was arrested. the bihar police are also seeking his remand in connection with a fake passport case.

18,Majority eludes parties in Pimpri-Chinchwad,"pune: with no political party reaching anywhere near the magic figure of 53 seats to gain majority in the pimpri-chinchwad municipal corporation (pcmc), an alliance between rival parties has become necessary. the front-runners -- nationalist congress party (ncp) and congress -- have held their cards close to their chest and are reluctant to speak on the issue. although the ncp, which has bagged 36 seats in the house of 105, has emerged as the single largest party, it still needs 17 more seats to retain its hold on the pcmc, the only municipal corporation in the state where it was in power. of the 12 independents who have won, five are ncp rebels and they are expected to join the party again. but, even if all the independents join the ncp, it will still need to have a tie-up with some major political party to gain power. the congress has bagged 32 seats, bjp 13, sena 11 and the janata dal has won one seat. in an interview to a private television channel on tuesday evening, state minister and congress leader from the pcmc belt ramkrishna more stressed that the ""communal forces"" need to be kept out of power. he also claimed that some independents had approached the congress. like the ncp, the congress too will not be able to gain power with the help of independents. hence, the congress-ncp workers are sure that their parties will join hands. however, some ncp leaders, on condition of anonymity, said their party may enter into an agreement with the bjp-sena combine for sharing of key posts in the pcmc, thus keeping the congress away. except ncp, all other parties have bagged more seats than they had in the present house of 79. the ncp had 42 corporators in the house. except mayor laxman gaikwad, all senior ncp leaders have lost the elections. they include stalwarts like ncp''s city unit chief vasant londhe, former mayor and the leader of the house azam pansare, former standing committee chairperson shamim pathan, ncp youth front leader vijay lande, deputy mayor murlidhar dhage and former leader of the house dnyaneshwar landge. the congress, which had 20 members in the civic body, has won 32 seats this time. the bjp, which had 12 members, has been able to win one more seat this time while the sena has increased its tally from nine to 11. however, considering that the strength of the house had increased from 79 to 105, the saffron alliance has not gained much. the election results indicate that the anti-incumbency factor was dominant. of the 58 sitting corporators who had had contested the polls, only 23 were elected.

19,British govt wants equal treatment for Bleach,"kolkata: britain has asked india to ensure ""equal treatment"" to peter bleach, a main accused in the purulia armsdrop case, according to a communique received by a city-based legal activist from uk''s foreign office. replying to a letter by legal activist dipak prahladka to british foreign secretary jack straw, an officer of the foreign and commonwealth division john culley said on january 18 the issue had been raised with the centre by straw himself and several of his ministerial colleagues, besides the british high commission in india. ""we believe that (bleach) should receive equal treatment with those who had been convicted with him ... you may be aware that the prime minister (blair) raised bleach''s case with union home minister l.k. advani during his recent visit to india. in particular, he raised the question of equ-al treatment. advani said he would look into the issue,"" the letter said, adding the british government would continue to do all that it ''properly'' could to help bleach. following the release of five latvian co-accused on july 22, the first british move for bleach''s release was initiated by straw on july 23 when he telephoned the union home minister expressing concerns about bleach''s continued detention. in a letter to bleach in september last year, baroness valerie amos, minister for consular matters in the british foreign and commonwealth office, referred to the straw-advani conversation and said her government was ""disappointed"" with advani''s response that bleach''s release would undermine the case against kim peter davy, the prime accused. ""(advani) argued that your case differed from that of the russians because you had contact with davy, the russians had not. jack straw asked if you could do anything to mitigate the situation and advani said he would look into this,"" baroness amos informed bleach in the letter. bleach is now languishing in the city''s presidency correctional home.

22,Pepsi seeks investment-friendly excise duty,"new delhi: ahead of the union budget, pepsi on wednesday said it can replicate the amul model by spreading contract farming in the country if excise duty, highest in the emerging world, is made investment-friendly to make the half-a-billion dollar food and beverages company in india cost-competitive. it was not the fdi policy that is shooing away foreign investment, but the ""domestic tax structure and redtapism,"" president and chief financial officer of pepsico, indra nooyi, told reporters, reeling out comparative statistics of india and china. ""we have now more or less the same level of investment in india and china. but we plan to grow more than four times in the next three to five years, but in india it is likely to be just about 60 per cent,"" nooyi said. a major dampener, she said, is the tax structure and the multinational company is willing to invest much more in this employment generating agro-based industry if the multi-point taxes of states and centre, put together at 39 per cent in india, is drascically reduced. the company, which is, however, ""optimistic"" of stepping up investment in the coming years as it saw india, russia and china as major growing markets, felt launch of central vat in april this year would help, pepsico india chairman p m sinha said regretting the step-motherly treatment meted out to soft drinks as compared to tea and biscuits when it came to excise. as far as consumption go, ""we are the third largest next only to tea and biscuits"", sinha said, adding, yet while tea attracted 4 per cent excise and biscuits 8-16 per cent, soft drinks attracted 32 per cent including 16 per cent special duty. that apart, there were multipoint taxes in states and pepsi attracted 24 per cent tax in states like maharashtra and karnatka, sinha said, pointing out it was just 10 per cent vat in thailand and 15 per cent even in pakistan. indicating that the company may come out with major expansion plans in april, pepsico beverages international president peter m thompson said the company would be going rural to tap the huge potential. apart from the international brands, it will also be introducing beverages to suit domestic taste, thompson said elaborating on the contract farming, sinha said it will soon set up one in rameshwaram, perhaps for corn cultivation. the details will be announced in april, he added. besides chillies,tomatoes and peanuts, pepsico has plans to expand job-creating contract farming in the entire country, particularly for fruits and vegetables on the lines of amul model, sinha said. when land holdings are small as in india, contract farming provided the answer for agricultural and rural development which the government wanted to give a new thrust to push up agricultural growth.

23,Women's bodies upset with finance minister,"new delhi: women''s organisations are upset that finance minister yashwant sinha has not consulted them while preparing the budget to be presented at the end of the month. in a long memorandum to sinha, the all-india democratic women''s association, associated with the communist party of india (marxist) and headed by well-known activist brinda karat, has expressed regret that he has not thought it necessary to consult women''s organisations on issues ""which will so deeply impact women''s status."" ""we had wished to meet you, as part of your pre-budget discussions with ''interest groups'', to present a more comprehensive picture of the minimum needs of women and children and how the budget could address them,"" the association has said. the letter quotes the ncw act to point out: ""we learn that even the national commission for women has not been consulted although as you are no doubt aware, it is mandatory for the government to consult the ncw on all policy matters concerning women."" the association has made several suggestions like refraining from levying any taxes on essential commodities and through other forms of indirect taxation as ""the consequent price hikes play havoc with the family budgets of millions of working people and the poor, the main burden of which is born by women."" it has expressed concern that ""gender concerns have been trivialised in budget allocations and reduced to tokenism. we are particularly concerned because available estimates of budgetary allocations for women-specific schemes in the last three years show a steady decline -- from 1.02 per cent in 1998-99, to 0.94 per cent in 1999-2000 to 0.87 per cent in both 2000-2001 and 2001-2002. in the year of women''s empowerment, the association has said, ""a measly rs 19.89 crores was allocated through the integrated women''s empowerment programme, a large part of which was for the celebrations of the year."" it has also pointed out anomalies like ""over rs 26 crores were allocated to the institute of fashion technology as part of women''s programmes under the ministry of textiles."" other matters of concern raised in the memorandum are the declining allocation for short-stay homes for women victims of domestic violence, downward revision of expenditure on elementary education and literacy and environment and forests and even rural development. the association has asked the government to make a firm commitment by making a very specific allocation in the budget for girl children."" seeking social security for groups like single women, including widows, poor, dalit, adivasi and muslim women, it has also asked for an increase in allocation of funds for developmental schemes and within those, at least forty per cent women-specific. it has quoted sobering figures from the mid-term appraisal of the ninth plan, pointing out that in spheres like employment, work, income, land, food security, nutrition, health and medical services and education, the lot of women is dismal and urgent government intervention is called for. the previous economic survey, says the association, had taken the first step of recognising the value of women''s unpaid work. ""if the government would put a value on it, it will find that women''s contribution to the economy is one of the highest subsidies being enjoyed by it.""

25,Manipur set to go for polls tomorrow,"imphal: manipur, after having been put under president''s rule, is set to go for polls on thursday for 40 of the 60 constituencies. what will be the final outcome is anyone''s guess as most parties are claiming to get ""at the most 15 to 20 seats with militants backing one party or the other."" dig bsf p k mishra while talking to the media on wednesday informed that the scene has so far been peaceful with no major incidence of violence but he also admitted that large number of candidates have either bought peace with the militants or are being backed by some faction or the other. while refusing to give the names of the candidates or the parties who paid the undergrounds, the dig said they have the intelligence information on this and they have also passed the same to the state authorities. ""now it is for them to do what they wish to do,"" said mishra. mishra said some of the areas where the candidates are reported to have paid are oinam, moirang bishanupur, thanga, nambol to name a few and this was after series of threats by organizations like kyklo. manipur ceo d s poonia while talking to this correspondent informed that they have deployed nearly 25,000 troops for the smooth polling in the state of which nearly 13,000 are from the state resources while bsf and crpf have brought in additional 6 battalions besides undisclosed number of army units. manipur dig (operations) h s sindhu informed that of the 1152 polling stations going to polls on thursday 253 are hyper sensitive, 564 sensitive and only 335 are normal in the four valley districts. he informed the most disturbed areas are in thoubal district. meanwhile the participation of undergrounds this time might have made the run up to the polling a smooth one but it will definitely influence the outcome of the polls. the former manipur chief minister rishang keishing said that ""militant organisations and other organisations on behalf of the militants threaten and extort money from only few candidates belonging to a particular party which indicates involvement of the militants in the elections process of the country."" rishang said, ""the involvement of militants organisations like nscn (im), kyklo and unlf etc are against congress candidates as they have closed our offices, pulled down flags and posters and warned our party workers to stop campaigning."" he said though the top leadership of nscn (im) has issued statement that they are in no way involved in the election process, ""but the ground realities are different and there cadres on ground are actively campaigning against congress (i) candidates. meanwhile additional army units have been rushed to the state seeing the tense situation in the hills and they will mostly be engaged in dominating the areas to prevent any activity of the militants that might disrupt the electoral process in the state.

27,"Oh, if only the polls go on and on!","kanakapura: voters in most rural pockets of kanakapura lok sabha by-election have only one demand in their wish list. that the electoral process should never end. reason: since february 1 they have been getting uninterrupted power for eight hours, which they fear will be suspended once their votes get locked in the electronic voting machines. never before has a ruling party in karnataka had to slug it out in a by-election as is being witnessed now for the february 21 by-poll. the congress struggle to retain the kanakapura seat is important as the outcome will have a bearing, perhaps, not on krishna''s administration, but the political gamble he has indulged in. his candidate-cum-protege co-operation minister d.k. shivakumar is bearing the cross for him. the outcome will also chart out former prime minister h.d. deve gowda''s political resurgence after his debacle in hassan in 1999. in this one-to-one contest, bjp nominee k.s. eshwarappa claims to spoil the duo''s chances in two assembly segments which his party represents. yet again, in a departure from the past, the congress poll plank is not the sympathy votes of sitting party mp m.v. chandrashekar murthy, whose death necessitated the by-poll. it is krishna''s image. and krishna himself is also their ``star campaigner.'''' but gowda''s forte has been ``sympathy'''' of a former pm languishing in political wilderness. with shivakumar and he being vokkaligas, which has nearly eight lakh of the total 24.98 lakh votes here, gowda is also whipping up the community''s sentiments of ``how a vokkaliga was destabilised from the pm''s post''''. although the congress holds four (including one represented by an associate member) of the total eight assembly segments, ramanagaram and channapatna are causing concern. the party is being restrengthened in ramanagaram and as a sop the local mla c.m. lingappa and another leader syed ziaullah have been made chairpersons of two statutory bodies. in channapatna, former congress legislator sadat ali khan is upset as he holds the party responsible for his defeat in 1999. he has been mollified to some extent, but khan has managed to send the message across to the local muslims the reason for his sulking. coupled with this some party leaders are not happy with shivakumar as the candidate. the disgruntlement stems from the apprehension of his upstaging senior vokkaligas and emerging as the community''s leader in the event of his victory. but everything does not seem to be smooth sailing for gowda. if his getting a lead in kanakapura is a certainty because of jdu leader p.g.r. sindhia, sathanur is considered shivakumar''s bastion, while in malavalli the jdu mla b. somashekar is not working. in ramanagaram and channapatna, the dal and congress will have to share the vokkaligas and muslims votes. the crucial lingayat votes have kept the congress and the dal on tenterhooks. gowda''s visits to lingayat maths have not gone unnoticed. the only vote bank which the congress feels is intact is that of scheduled castes and the slum-dwellers who together account for nearly 8.50 lakh. the bjp aware of its limitations has an axe to grind. by fielding eshwarappa, a kuruba, the party wants to cut into these votes which jd(s) president siddaramaiah would have fetched for gowda. but the clinching factor for the candidate''s victory is the 12.39 lakh voters in uttarahalli. the constituency is represented by the bjp. in the 1999 lok sabha election, the congress'' failure to secure a lead in uttarahalli was made up in other segments. it won by a narrow margin of 34,017 votes. for this very reason, the congress has divided uttarahalli into segments and deputed ministers. the dal is making equal efforts while the bjp is confident of retaining its hold.
