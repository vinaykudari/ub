0,Recruitment policy for teachers flayed,"AHMEDABAD: Flaying the state secondary and higher secondary education boardâ€™s new recruitment policy for teachers, Charutar Vidya Mandal honorary secretary R C Desai said the new system puts meritorious applicants to a disadvantage.

After the board quashed the old system of apportioning three marks for personal interview, selectors had to depend entirely on academic documents, Desai said.

â€œThis is harmful as degrees of all the universities are not comparable. Certain institutions are far too generous.â€�

Moreover, the new system will only aggravate the rush for more marks, which is at the root of all evils, he added.

Desai suggested that the government should instead introduce a state-level test for secondary school teachers, to ensure the selection of competent candidates.

1,"Sec 144 in Ropar dist, Akalis arrested","CHANDIGARH: Hundreds of Akali Dal workers and leaders were rounded up in a statewide crackdown on Saturday to foil any attempt to hold a rally in Ropar on December 1 when Parkash Singh Badal, his wife Surinder and son Sukhbir appear before a special court in the town. Senior Akali leaders said the arrests totalled over 2,000, but the state government or the police refused to say anything about it.

Prohibitory orders under Section 144 CrPC were clamped on Ropar district and all district police chiefs were directed to stay in station for the next two days. The police started erecting barricades in different parts of the state to stop party workers from proceeding towards Ropar. An official press release said the government had decided to take â€˜â€˜firm actionâ€™â€™ against any attempt to â€˜â€˜put pressureâ€™â€™ on the court when Badal presents himself before it.

The release says that more than 1,000 security personnel, specially trained in crowd anti-sabotage skills, had been mobilised for deployment in Ropar district and the Ludhiana police range.

Duty magistrates have been deployed and additional premises designated as temporary jails to deal with the situation.

A report from Kharar said the police raided the residences of junior vice-president of SAD Rajbir Singh Padiala and SGPC member Sadhu Singh Todarmajra but failed to take them into custody. However, veteran Akali leader Jagmal Singh Todarmajra and the former sarpanch of Rurki Niranjan were rounded up. The residence of the Kharar circle president of SAD Prem Singh was also raided but he was not at home.

Padiala said that prominent Akali leaders, including Badal, were expected to attend a function to mark the death anniversary of his father and former Kharar MLA Bachittar Singh. He said the Akalis would â€˜â€˜never give in to muscle power unleashed by Amarinder Singhâ€™â€™.

There were unconfirmed reports that some other Akali leaders, including Mahinder Singh, Baljeet Singh, Niranjan Singh and Tilak Raj Chaddha of the BJP, had also been picked up.

Some Akali leaders were rounded up in Patiala, Fatehgarh Sahib and Sangrur districts. The Ropar district administration has requested for two magistrates each from Fatehgarh Sahib and Patiala to be posted in Ropar on Monday when Badal appears in a court there.

Parkash Singh Badal said the action against leaders and workers of his party was â€˜â€˜typical of the panic-ridden government led by Amarinder that has failed to find any evidence against me or members of my family for alleged wrongdoing.â€™â€™

2,BJP raps govt for ban on Taslima's book,"KOLKATA: The BJP and Trinamul Congress on Saturday criticised the decision of the West Bengal government to ban Taslima Nasrin's book Dwikhondito. In an open letter to CM Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, BJP state president Tathagata Roy said Bhattacharjee's move was aimed at capturing the minority vote bank. It is ironic that he was vocal against Saraswati Bandana, but he decided to ban the book of an author who has taken up her pen against the persecution of the Bangla-deshi minority community, he said. In his letter, Roy demanded that a book called Hindutva and Islam be banned as it contained derogatory remarks on Hinduism. In a Press conference, Roy read out passages from the book. Questioning who were the intellectuals who had read Taslima's book and advised the government to ban it, he asked if they were the same who had taken out a procession in support of the drawing of Saraswati in the nude. Trinamul leader Pankaj Banerjee, too, criticised the decision to ban the book, stating it should have been left to the readers to decide if it was offensive.
