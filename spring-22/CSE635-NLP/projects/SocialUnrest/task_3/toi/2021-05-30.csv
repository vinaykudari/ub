0,Centre defers SGPC polls by 3 months,"CHANDIGARH:The Union home ministry has decided to defer the SGPC elections, which was scheduled to take place on July 11, by three months, reliable sources said on Saturday.

The Centre''s decision comes a day after Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh called on Union home minister Shivraj Patil in New Delhi to make a strong case for the postponement of the elections on various grounds.

The SGPC polls have been pending since 2001. The Centre''s decision is expected to be conveyed to the Gurdwara Election Commission by Monday.

Chairman of the commission Justice (retd) JS Sekhon, however, said he had not heard from the Centre on the matter as yet, adding that the election process had been already initiated with a direction to Punjab, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh to issue gazette notification on June 1.

Sekhon said the election date (July 11) was decided after a consensus was reached at an all-party meeting following which the Centre gave an undertaking in the Punjab and Haryana high court to conduct the election on the said date.

The high court had asked the Centre to expedite the election process since the elections had been due since 2001. The postponement comes after the commission had announced the schedule for the elections and allotted symbols to the contesting parties. While the grounds on which the Centre based its decision to put off the elections were not known, the chief minister, in his meeting with Patil, had reportedly pointed out that the issue of the sehajdharis'' participation in the election was still pending in the court.

Amarinder Singh had also expressed reservations over the elections being conducted by the present chairman of the commission, who, he said, was related to Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) chief Parkash Singh Badal. PPCC president HS Hanspal said on Saturday that he too favoured the postponement of the elections. â€œIt''s a brazen attempt to meddle in the SGPC affairs. The Congress is buying time to tamper with the electoral rolls.â€�

1,RJD planning to rig Chhapra polls: BJP,"PATNA: State unit if the BJP on Saturday charged the RJD with making moves to usurp people''s mandate in Chhapra on May 31 with the help of local police and district administration.

Chief whip of BJP legislature party in state assembly Navin Kishore Prasad Sinha and party spokesperson Kiran Ghai, in a joint statement issued here, said although polls are being held for only Chhapra Lok Sabha seat on May 31, yet the administration had failed to appoint Central government employees as presiding officers for all the polling stations of the constituency. They said that till Saturday, only 652 presiding officers were imparted training in conducting the polls, though the constituency has 1,157 polling stations.

The two BJP leaders also alleged that the office of the chief electoral officer (CEO), Bihar, had not yet sent its report to Election Commission (EC) regarding deployment of para-military police, changes made in the local administration and training of presiding officers in the constituency. The EC could have taken corrective measures had it received any report from the office of CEO regarding any deficiency in the arrangements being made by the Saran district administration to conduct the polls, they added.

Sinha and Ghai requested the EC to keep a close watch on the activities of local civil and police officials, particularly the officials indicted by the it, for alleged poll irregularities on April 26.

2,"Stop cribbing, Pawar tells farm lobby","MUMBAI: Union agriculture minister and NCP leader Sharad Pawar did some plain speaking on Saturday which may not be music to the ears of those who are propping up the UPA government.

Talking to newspersons soon after a rousing welcome for him and his cabinet colleague Praful Patel at Santa Cruz airport, Pawar said it was time Indian farmers stopped cribbing. Instead they should think global and compete with farmers of the world.

He advised Indian farmers to stop complaining about the import of fruits, vegetables and cereals. He said the WTO regime was inevitable and no government can ignore developments in global markets.

He said the UPA''s efforts would be to help Indian farmers, specially the medium and small ones to become more competitive. He said the erstwhile NDA had ignored farmers and had failed to carry out reforms in the farm sector.

Pawar, who was accompanied by Patel and NCP''s youth wing president Narendra Verma, said he had a vision to make the rural economy vibrant and make a global farmer out of Indian kisans.

4,Mulayam fears Cong may topple UP govt,"NEW DELHI: UP chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav is apprehensive that Congress will try to fell the Samajwadi Party-led government in the state and hold assembly polls much before the government completes its tenure, two years from now.

Samajwadi Party leadership feels that the twin temptations of divesting Mulayam Singh Yadav of power in Uttar Pradesh and pleasing his arch rival, BSP, might lead the Congress to pull down its government in Uttar Pradesh.

The Congress already has a commitment from Mayawati on BSP support to the Congress-led UPA government at the Centre. That support can be formalised any time that suits the Congress.

The consideration of a tie-up with BSP in UP is believed to be one of the reasons for which Congress has been avoiding a tie-up with SP even when the latter offered unconditional support.

With Mayawati on its side, the Congress is now trying to woo Ajit Singh into crossing over to the Congress camp and snapping his ties with SP.

If Congress and Ajit Singh''s Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) get together in UP and withdraw support, the Mulayam Singh government will topple for lack of numbers. The RLD has 14 MLAs in the state, seven of whom are ministers.

A ministership for Ajit Singh at the Centre is an obvious that will follow in the deal. Mayawati may also join the UPA government in such a situation.

5,Anti tobacco activist demands ban on tobacco farming,"PUNE: Anti tobacco activist Kalyan Gangwal has demanded status of narcotics to tobacco and ban on tobacco farming in a phased manner in a bid to curb tobacco addiction among Indian people.

Gangwal made this demand while speaking to TNN on Sunday on the eve of world no tobacco day observed on May 31. He has also submitted a memorandum to state and union government listing these demands.

Giving tobacco related statistics pertaining to India, Gangwal said that as per estimates over 142 million men and 37 million women above 15 years of age regularly used tobacco. Approximately 4 million children under the age of 15 consumed tobacco products in our country, he stated.

Gangwal, also a medical practitioner, revealed that tobacco was re-ported to cause around 6.35 lakh deaths annually and as many as 25 per cent of all persons above the age of 40 in urban India who smoked reportedly suffered from chronic bronchitis. ""The number of avoidable cases of chronic heart disease and chronic obstructive lung disease has been estimated at 12 million per year"", he added.

Gangwal said that the incidence of oral cancer caused by tobacco chewing in India was one of the worldâ€™s highest - about one third of all cancer cases, with 90 per cent of the patients being tobacco chewers. Throwing light on tobaccoâ€™s impact on environment, Gangwal stated that the tobacco industry was depleting forest re-sources as much of the tobacco produced in developing countries required upto 25 kg of wood for curing each kg of tobacco. It has been reported that the pesticides and fertilisers used by tobacco farmers degraded the soil and polluted water sources.

Gangwal told TNN that on the occasion of world no tobacco day, he has sent a memorandum to state and union governments suggesting ways to curb tobacco addiction. ""Tobacco contained nicotine so it should be given the status of narcotics so as to enable government to enforce narcotics related laws to prevent tobacco addition"", he observed. He felt that the government should make it mandatory to write a health warning stating that ""tobacco caused heart disease, cancer and impotence"" on all tobacco products.

The anti tobacco activist also suggested that tobacco farming be banned in a phased manner on lines with ganja and brown sugar farming.
