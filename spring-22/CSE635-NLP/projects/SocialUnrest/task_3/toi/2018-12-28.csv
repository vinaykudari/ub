1,Differences brew in govt over coffee homes,"new delhi: making losses of over rs 1.5 lakh a month, the state-run coffee homes are no longer the government's cup of tea. while the bureaucrats are in favour of handing over the four state-run coffee homes to multinational food chains like mcdonalds or barista, tourism minister ajay maken is opposing the move claiming it's the government's social responsibility to run these cafes. maken says with a little face-lift and a huge subsidy, these cafes can be pulled out from the present financial mess. maken is planning to subsidise services offered at these cafes. the price of food-items will be made reasonable, the menu will be extended and association of senior citizens or freedom fighters will be roped in for running these coffee houses. maken said: ''while providing a quick bite to ordinary people who cannot afford to go to expensive restaurants, the coffee home is also a place where the elderly can meet and relax. we want to maintain this culture.'' the officials, however, are skeptical about his plans. while maken asserts the coffee homes should be revived on government initiative, the officials have been advocating private partnership for this venture. said a senior official at delhi tourism and transport corporation limited: ''multinationals have opened cafes all over the city. they are tough competition for coffee homes which are already in a dismal state. the government can tie up with some prominent food chains to revive business.'' maken differs. ''if the private companies must revive state-run coffee homes, why should the government retain ownership of these cafes?'' he asked. he said: ''the idea is not to make profit, but to keep the coffee home culture alive. these cafes cater to lower and middle income groups and we will ensure that the food items here are reasonably priced.'' among the five dttdc-run coffee homes in the city, four are in business. the coffee home at connaught place, which is the oldest in the chain, is also the only one making profits of rs 20,000-rs 30,000 a month. the coffee homes at r k puram, ito and laxmi nagar make losses worth rs 40,000-rs 50,000 a month. dttdc officials said the coffee home at bahadur shah zafar marg is doing the worst. the coffee house at indira gandhi airport had to be shut down by the dttdc a year-and-a-half ago after it incurred huge losses. a new one which was set up at ajmal khan park in karol bagh has yet not become operational. maken said the project had got delayed as the government could not find a suitable caterer to run the coffee home at karol bagh.

2,SC rules against defaulting tenants,"new delhi: a tenant who has defaulted in paying rent on time is liable to eviction even if he chooses to deposit the arrears with the court. the supreme court said that in order to avoid eviction, a defaulting tenant, must first try to pay the money to the landlord through money order or cheque before depositing it with the court. upholding the eviction of a tenant who had deposited the rent arrears with a rajasthan rent tribunal without resorting to the other two methods, a bench comprising justice r c lahoti and justice brijesh kumar said: ''...the tenant's right to deposit the rent in the court arises if such a deposit is preceded by the tenant having adopted one of the two methods contemplated by clauses (a) and (b) of sub-section (3) of section 19(a) of the act''. section 19(a) of the rajasthan premises (control of rent and eviction) act, 1950, takes care of recalcitrant tenants who either do not pay the rent when due or raise false pleas of payment to harass the landlord and indulge in litigation, the court explained. sub-section (1) obliges a tenant to pay the rent in accordance with the contract and in the absence of a contract by the fifteenth day of the month for which the rent is payable. a landlord is obliged under (sub-section(2)) to issue a receipt or acknowledgement for any payment towards rent. sub- section (3) takes care of a situation where there may be a controversy as to whether the tenant fulfilled his obligation to pay rent. apart from the personal payment of rent by the tenant, the amount can be paid by money order and it would suffice if the money order bears an address which is the ''ordinary'' address of the landlord. the other alternative is that the tenant may by notice require the landlord to specify, within 10 days, the name of a bank and bank account number wherein the tenant may deposit the rent due. the landlord is obliged to convey the details of his bank account. the deposit of rent in the bank discharges the tenant of his obligation to tender the monthly amount. however, if the landlord refuses to inform the tenant about his bank account nor accepts the money order sent to him, the tenant can deposit the amount with the court, the bench explained in a significant judgment which now settles for good the controversy over legitimate method of paying rent.

4,Has govt done what it promised?,"chandigarh:though ideally you should never blow your own trumpet, punjab ministers have been issuing statement after statement about the work done by their government. however, at times, their assertions are half-truths divorced from reality or promises which are not likely to be kept. a few instances show that the ministers' claims were only averments of their intentions. claim: minister for rural development and panchayats nirmal singh kahlon had issued a statement, on december 7, stating that the government had decided to transfer powers to the panchayati raj institutions (pris), under the 73rd amendment to the constitution. he had stated that pris, particularly panchayats, would be given administrative control of 29 departments, as listed in the 11th schedule of the constitution. he had also said that that the transfer of the functionaries of the 29 departments and the proposition of required budgetary support to pris would be put before the cabinet sub-committee by a panel constituted for the purpose. facts: the government has made no efforts to delegate powers to the pris or local bodies.the shiromani akali dal-led government, which had advocated devolution of powers to the states, should have transferred subjects and the budgetary allocation mentioned in schedule 11 and 12 to pris and local bodies.as recommended by the state finance commission, revenue generated by certain taxes was also to be given to the local bodies. claim: minister of local government balramji dass tandon had said in a statement issued november 12 that the government has formulated a plan for improving the condition of slum dwellers. for which, rs 10.92 crore has already been spent during the last four years. rs 9.95 crore had also been earmarked for this purpose, during the year 2001-2002. facts: the union government had released rs 34 crore, during 1997-2000, under its 'national slum development programme'. however, the state government released only rs 13 crore to the state urban development authority. the remaining funds were diverted.the union government has stopped releasing slum development funds to punjab.the state had failed to furnish the utilisation certificate. claim: throughout the year, the government has droned on about its commitment to the scheduled castes/scheduled tribes of the state. it had said that 8,000 dwelling units, costing rs 45 crore, have been made for the scs/sts. facts: at least 11 per cent of the government budget was being earmarked for the special component plan for the sc population. only this year, the allocation was hiked to 14.06 per cent. however, there is a gap between the allocation and the amount released.the government has admitted that all is not well. the finance department had failed to release rs 33.51 crore of the special central assistance towards the plan. needless to say, the funds were diverted. the 8,000 dwelling units were built during the the government's first year. the scheme was later abandoned. no funds have been sanctioned for building housing units since the last three years. it is a separate matter that the government had promised to build 12,000 units, each year.

6,"Chautala indifferent to farmers’ plight, says Hooda","chandigarh: the congress, on thursday, asked the state government to try and resolve issues of recovery of power arrears from farmers through dialogue before disconnecting the power supply. lashing out at the state government for resorting to firing and lathi-charge on farmers at kandela village, recently, when they were agitating against the government's decision to disconnect power supply to their village as they had not cleared their power bills, haryana congress president bhupinder singh hooda said, at a press conference here, that chief minister om prakash chautala should not forget how he, as an opposition leader, used to urge the farming community not to clear power bills in protest against high rates. what was more shocking, he said, was that the chief minister was completely indifferent towards the plight of farmers in his own state ""while in up he demands creation of a separate kisan pradesh"". he also demanded a compensation of rs 2 lakh each for those injured in police action and strict disciplinary action against officials responsible for the alleged highhandedness. the state congress president further stated that the government was taking action against maxi-cab owners for various reasons, as a result of which the people living in villages situated on link roads were facing a lot of hardships.the government should first provide adequate transport facilities to these villagers before taking action against maxi-cab owners. asked if his party had chosen its candidate for the yamunanagar assembly by-election, hooda said the candidate would be selected in due course and the congress was confident of winning the by election as all sections of haryana society were disillusioned with the ruling indian national lok dal bjp combine. he, however, alleged that bogus voters were being enrolled in the yamunanagar constituency. state congress workers and senior leaders would go for canvassing to punjab, up and other states where the polls were scheduled in february, said hooda. in reply to another question, hooda said the changes made in the house tax policy by the state government were ''merely an eyewash"". reiterating his party's demand to scrap the new policy in toto, hooda said that house tax in faridabad was nine times more than that in other parts of the state. he asked the bjp to desist from taking any electoral advantage from the prevailing standoff with pakistan, as was allegedly done in the wake of the kargil conflict.

''the resignation letter came through a close confidant of sanjay,'' a source said. interestingly, even as state congress chief and medical education minister shakeel ahmad and aicc general secretary mahabir prasad said they would hand over sanjay's resignation letter to the cm in the evening, rabri had already accepted it. sanjay, who is the main accused in the carnage, and his father rajo singh (mp), named as a conspirator, were livid over the development. ''rjd chief laloo prasad yadav knows the conspirators behind the carnage,'' sanjay told reporters, displaying his resignation letter. he said he had tried to meet laloo, but the rjd supremo refused to meet him. he said he had resigned because the cm had lost confidence in him, adding that the dominance of his father over the political affairs of sheikhpura would continue and nobody could challenge it. in fact, intense politicking was witnessed on friday as the rjd tried to playdown the carnage, but hit out against rajo singh.
