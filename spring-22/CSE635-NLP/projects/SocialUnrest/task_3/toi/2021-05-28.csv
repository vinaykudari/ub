0,Media's role in violence against women discussed,"KANPUR: Mahila Manch and Sakhi Kendra organised a workshop on the role of media in context of gender and violence against women here on Thursday.

During the interactive session, speakers said that media played a pivotal role in stopping injustices to women.

Organisation''a head Neelam Chaturvedi said, ""Despite efforts to an environment which does not differentiates on gender basis, the fact is that gender-based violence is on the rise thereby neutralising all efforts.""

She said steps should be taken to ensure gender equality at the grass root level and to the rural populace. She further said that this would help in checking violence against women in the society as a whole.

She said that every month they receive nearly 45 to 50 cases of which more than 45 per cent were of domestic violence and dowry harassment.

""We should sit together and discuss serious issues inhibiting woman''s ability to enjoy right to freedom and right to equality,"" opines Neelam.

During the media advocacy workshop on gender and violence against women, members of the organisations said that media should highlight injustices meted out to women by the male dominated society.

Addressing a meet of party workers in south Kolkata, she said factionalism is present within the party in a few of the wards. ""This will not be tolerated. I will break all the groups,"" Banerjee said.

3,Army updates new govt on terror camps,"NEW DELHI: Pakistan continues to let the jehadi infrastructure, targeted against Jammu and Kashmir, operate from its soil. This, in short, is the message the Army conveyed to the country''s new leadership.

Sources said the Army top brass, in a series of meetings which included one with defence minister Pranab Mukherjee on Thursday, has briefed the new government on the internal and external security and strategic scenario.

As per the Army assessment, there are still 85 to 100 terrorist training and support camps operating in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, with around 3,500 to 4,000 well-trained jehadis ""sitting across"".

""We have managed to eliminate a large number of terrorists inside Kashmir, especially area commanders of different tanzims. Over 370 militants have been killed since January, with around 120 security forces personnel dying in these encounters,"" said an officer.

""There were around 3,500 terrorists inside the state about a year ago. Now, our assessment is that their number has gone down to 1,800-2,000. Infiltration is down but the real test will come towards June-end when snow fully melts north of Pir Panjal,"" he added.

The Army feels that Pakistan still has its hand firmly on the terror tap and a proper assessment of the situation can only be made after June.

4,Shinde budgets for polls,"MUMBAI: It is tempting to play Santa Claus when elections are round the corner.

With the assembly polls scheduled for September, this is what Maharashtra''s finance minister Jayant Patil did on Thursday by presenting a Rs 7,303-crore deficit budget which is aimed at pleasing most sections of society through a sop opera never mind the Rs 83,000-crore debt burden.

Farmers, government employees, traders, pensioners, the middle class and students are sought to be put in the feel-good mood by Patil in the fifth budget presented by him.

In a bid to boost commercial activity, stamp duty rates on transactions on commercial properties and sale of lands was reduced to 5 per cent.

""The upper limit for all commercial transactions will not exceed five per cent stamp duty. The move will help increase the transactions in this sector and the volume of business will increase,"" a senior official said.

He said the stamp duty rates for transactions concerning commercial properties was 10 per cent in Mumbai, Pune and Thane and in other corporation areas it was eight per cent to 6 per cent.

The underlining message was clear. The Congress-Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) combine, which could bag only 23 of the 48 Lok Sabha seats, was on a wooing spree to recapture power in the assembly polls.

For example, special development packages were announced for Vidarbha and Marathwada where the secular alliance''s performance in the LS polls was pathetic.

Government and semi-government employees, who form a sizable chunk of the electorate across the state, have been given a six per cent increase in dearness allowance over and above the prevailing rate of 55 per cent.

Also, 50 per cent of the DA has beenmerged with the basic pay. A slew of concessions has been announced for kunbis, scheduled castes, tribes and Muslims.

6,UPA government will be stable: Pranab,"KOLKATA: The UPA government is going to be a stable one, though the Left parties have not signed its Common Minimum Programme, Union Defence Minister Pranab Mukherjee said in Kolkata on Friday.

â€œThere is nothing to be worried about, as the CMP is an agenda on how the government will be run. And, the Left parties are not a part of the government,â€� Mukherjee said.

â€œTo keep the BJP out, it is necessary. If the Congress does not form the government, there would not be a vacuum. For, no one wants another election now. The Left parties have taken the right decision,â€� he said.

At a press conference, Mukherjee was defensive about the appointment of ministers against whom cases were pending. â€œUnless someone is convicted, he should be allowed to continue as minister,â€� he said, when the name of railway minister Laloo Prasad Yadav was mentioned.

â€œIn this, we are offering the same excuse which the previous NDA government had offered,â€� he said. â€œEven against senior ministers like HRD minister Murali Manohar Joshi criminal cases are pending.â€�

""The six main principles on which the UPA government would run are increasing economic growth, generating employment, promoting social harmony, ensuring equality before law, empowering women and improving the condition of the weaker sections,"" he said.

In West Bengal, the Congress would continue to oppose the atrocities of the CPM, Mukherjee emphasized. The fact that the UPA was dependent on Left support would not change this situation. â€œEveryone knows the condition in the three Left - ruled states of West Bengal, Kerala and Tripura.â€�

""On previous occasions, the Congress was dependent on Left support for forming a government at the Centre, but its policy of confronting the CPM in West Bengal continued,"" Mukherjee said.

â€œThose who had left the Congress in the state are welcome to return,â€� he said, referring to the formation of the Trinamul Congress. Mukherjee said a new president for the West Bengal Pradesh Congress Committee will have to be found to replace him, as he would now be busy at the Centre in his new role. The final decision would be taken by Congress president Sonia Gandhi.

8,Hartals: govt should request for paramilitary forces,"KOCHI: In a significant ruling, a full bench of the Kerala High Court on Friday held that the state government should request the centre for army or military forces if it is unable to provide protection to citizens during hartals and said political parties and organisations calling for hartals will have to compensate for any injuries caused to people and damage to their property during the strike.

The bench, while turning down the plea of six petitioners to prohibit hartals and strikes, said if the state government felt that it would be unable to give adequate protection to citizens in the event of hartals, it should request the centre for deputing army or paramilitary forces so that there should not be any constitutional breakdown and violation of fundamental rights of citizens.

The judgment was delivered by the bench, comprising chief justice N K Sodhi, justices J B Koshy and A K Basheer, while disposing of six public interest litigations against the calling of hartals.

The bench held that the government should adequately compensate for the injuries caused to the people and any damage to their property as they had failed to fulfill their constitutional obligation to protect life and property of the citizen. The same should be recovered from those who caused the damage, including from the political parties or organisers who have called for such hartals or general strikes.

Effective action should be taken under the prevention of damages to public property act 84 and circulars in this regard should be implemented strictly, it said.
