0,Left isolated after rift over presidential polls,"NEW DELHI: The most obvious outcome of the fierce feud over the selection of Presidential candidate is the near-total isolation of the Left grouping.

The Left which formed the Peopleâ€™s Front by wooing Mulayam Singh Yadavâ€™s Samajwadi Party last year and built bridges with the Congress, suddenly finds itself trekking a lonely track.

The differences with Mulayam became so irreconcilable over supporting Kalam that the year-old Front had to be dissolved. â€˜â€˜We threw them out, they did not get a chance to walk out,â€™â€™ CPM general secretary Surjeet said at a press conference.

Even after the rift with Mulayam, the Left still hoped of enlisting the Congress support behind a candidate acceptable to both. By then, however, Kalam had emerged as a national icon symbolising the aspirations of the people. Being a mainstream party the Congress found it difficult to reject him and risk a middleclass backlash.

By the time the Congress made clear its preference for Kalam, a war was raging â€” not between the BJP and the rest but between the Left and others. The end-result: alienation of the Left and breakdown of the Opposition unity that had crystallized over the Gujarat issue. Perhaps the compulsions of realpolitik will bring them together again once the storm over the Presidential poll subsides. â€˜â€˜We have not closed the door on them, we can do business together again,â€™â€™ the SP spokesman said. But as of now the opposition groups remain badly scarred from sniping at one another.

Meanwhile, the Left has cited the scientistâ€™s silence on the recent Gujarat violence as one of reasons for opposing him. â€˜â€˜Some people approached him for his views on the communal riots in Gujarat, but there was no response,â€™â€™ H S Surjeet told TNN. It has also been objecting to Kalam since he was primarily the NDA choice.

â€˜â€˜A nuclear scientist is not an ideal candidate for the Presidentâ€™s office we need a man aware of the constitutional implications of various (government) actions,â€™â€™ CPI leader A B Bardhan said.

1,Rebellion spares no party,"PUNE: While the demand for the expulsion of Congress city unit chief Mohan Joshi has shaken the Congers party, all is not well in the opposition camp either.

Be it Anil Shirole of the BJP, Ravindra Malwadkar of NCP or Rambhau Parikh of the Shiv Sena, city unit chiefs of all parties are facing an unrest.

City MP Pradeep Rawat and a group of BJP corporators have accused Shirole of favouritism while distributing the tickets for the municipal school board polls. Although they have not made an official demand for Shiroleâ€™s ouster, Rawat minced no words in criticising Shirole at a party meeting last week.

During the meeting, Rawat had even alleged that MLC Prakash Jawdekar had asked the partymen to boycott a rally organised by him (Rawat) to express solidarity with the Indian soldiers.

NCPâ€™s Ravindra Malwadkar is also not so fortunate. The rival camp, led by corporator Nitin Jagtap, has been issuing press statements regularly, accusing him of being â€œcasteistâ€�, and demanding his expulsion.

A group of Sena men belonging to the faction of MLA Deepak Paigude is highly disappointed as their leader was not consulted while choosing the nominees for the civic and school board polls.

2,Ministers’ meet to discuss housing laws,"HYDERABAD: A conference of urban development ministers of all states will be held in New Delhi on June 27 to discuss about stamp duty, the Urban Ceiling Act and reframing of rental laws, according to Union urban development minister Bandaru Dattatreya.

Speaking to reporters here on Sunday, he said the government had allocated Rs 500 crore in the budget for housing schemes. One-third of the amount would be given to all states and a memorandum of understanding would be signed in this regard, he said.

Commenting on discrepancies in housing schemes in various states, he said the government would draft common policy to expedite the process of housing schemes and ensure that the funds allocated were spent properly.

Expressing reservations over the accounting system being followed in municipalities, he said that the government would favour foolproof double accounting system.

The stamp duty in the state was high when compared to other states and suggested that it should be around five per cent.

Dattatreya reiterated that the government was committed to provide housing for every one by 2010. In pursuance of this programme, the government had already built 27.48 lakh houses in the last four years as against the target of 28 lakh houses. The shortage of houses in urban areas was 75.76 lakh and 1.36 crore in rural areas, he added.

BJP official spokesperson G Kishan Reddy was also present at the press conference.

3,Consensus on VP ruled out,"HYDERABAD: Union Bandaru Dattatreya ruled out the Congress partyâ€™s proposal for a consensus candidate for the post of vice-president.

Speaking to reporters on Sunday, Dattatreya said that the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) could win the vicepresident election without the help of the Congress. Knowing the NDAâ€™s arithmetic advantage, the Congress was talking about consensus for the vice-presidential election, he said.

Dattatreya felt that the Congress was supporting Abdul Kalamâ€™s candidature, as it had left with no other option. â€œFearing that it would lose the minority vote bank, the Congress is supporting Kalam,â€� he said.

4,Census dispels TRS claim on govt employees,"HYDERABAD: An employee census conducted by the government with regard to the implementation of a GO Ms. No. 610, â€” which governs the proportion of â€˜localâ€™ and â€˜non-localâ€™ persons employed by the government â€” has taken the wind out of the sails of the Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS), which is fighting for a separate Telangana on the grounds that people of the region are being discriminated against in terms of jobs.

The census of government employees was conducted by the planning department upon the instructions of the government and an Assembly committee was constituted to look into the controversial issue. About 6.74 lakh employees at all levels of the hierarchy were covered by the census.

The study categorised staffers as â€˜localâ€™ if they had spent four uninterrupted years as a student in a region up to the matriculation stage.

As per GO 610 norms, a minimum of 80 per cent should be locals and 20 per cent non-locals in employment. The census found that 92.29 per cent of the government employees were locals in the state working in 23 districts and a mere 7.71 per cent non-local.

The Telangana region has more than 90 per cent of the locals working in the districts. The Hyderabad district has 81.94 per cent locals and 18.06 per cent non-locals. Medak, the native district of TRS chief K Chandrashekhar Rao, has 94.01 per cent locals among the regular government employees and 5.99 per cent non-locals. The Ranga Reddy district has 88.37 locals and 11.63 non-locals.

About 93.99 per cent of the locals were working in rural local bodies against 6.01 per cent of non-locals. The situation is more or less same with regard to urban local bodies.

The officials had taken self declarations from the employees working in the government about their nativity with relevant certificates in some cases. The employees were warned of serious action in case false information was furnished.

The details of the survey were presented to the house committee and the members of the Congress and Bharatiya Janata Parties were convinced about the census. But Chandrashekhar Rao has raised objections about the numbers.

However, the officials who gave a floppy containing all the details to Rao have requested him to cross check the information along with place of working, date since which the employees were working, all of which are available on the Net.

5,"Get rid of brokers, CM tells ministers","RANCHI: Jharkhand Chief Minister Babulal Marandi on Saturday asked his ministers to eliminate both brokers and delay while finalising tenders and awarding work order.

He has written to his ministers that the process of finalising tenders and contracts should be simplified and expedited so that development works do not suffer because of red tapism, middlemen and corruption.

He has asked that agreement between a works division and the contractor should be completed in the shortest possible time so that â€˜middlemenâ€™ do not get time to operate and spread corruption. He has suggested that the ministers should ask their secretaries that work order and agreement should be completed within two days at the maximum, once the tender panel has decided on the name of the contractor.

And those officials who still try to delay the process of agreement and issue of work order, should be identified so that disciplinary action could be initiated. Marandiâ€™s letter has been addressed to urban development minister Bachcha Singh, energy minister Lal Chand Mahto, water resources minister Ram Chander Kesri, (REO) Madhu Koda, road minister Sudesh Mahto and building minister.

11,Lyngdoh: World can watch J&K polls,"SRINAGAR: Legal action will be taken against security forces if they force people to vote in the coming J&K assembly elections, said Chief Election Commissioner J M Lyngdoh here on Monday. He also made it clear that he was not averse to foreign observers, but they cannot be a part of the official team.

Lyngdohâ€™s comments came in response to reports of widespread rigging in the last assembly elections by the ruling National Conference. There were complaints from the Opposition that the party was assisted by the security forces. This had also led to the recurring demand that the poll process be overseen by foreign observers, especially among the separatist groups.

â€˜â€˜Anybody from anywhere in the world would be given access to polling stations,â€™â€™ said Lyngdoh, â€˜â€˜but they cannot be part of our official observer team and we would not invite them.â€™â€™

The official observer team, which would be in charge of ensuring a free and fair polls, would be a batch of handpicked people, who â€˜â€˜would not be afraid of anybodyâ€™â€™, he said. But media, said Lyngdoh, is the best observer and both international and national media would have free access to the polling stations and the voters. â€˜â€˜We are doing this deliberately... as they are the best observers,â€™â€™ he said.

Regarding the security forces, Lyngdoh issued a clear and unequivocal warning: â€˜â€˜Uniformed forces are not there to rig elections or increase the poll percentage... no Indian can be compelled to vote. Anybody indulging in such activity will commit an electoral offence and be prosecuted under the law.â€™â€™

Outlining the role of the forces, he said their job is to â€˜â€˜sanitise the area, assist and reassure voters.â€™â€™ This, however, does not mean that the security forces would be in charge of providing transportation to the voters. they would have to go on their own to vote.

Lyngdoh also said he would carefully examine complaints voiced by the Opposition that the National Conference might rig the elections by using counter-insurgents and special task force.

If the railway minister persisted with the move, an all- party delegation of MLAs from West Bengal should visit Delhi and take up the matter with Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and the Railway Minister, he said.

21,No new rules on trawler ban: Minister,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Fisheries minister K.V. Thomas on Monday said that the UDF government had not incorporated any new guidelines and regulations while enforcing the 45-day ban on monsoon trawling by mechanised fishing boats, from June 15.

Replying to an adjournment motion in the assembly, moved by the opposition, on the `tense'' situation in coastal areas due to trawling ban, Thomas said the government had not banned fishing by country boats fitted with out-board engines and of ""kattmarans"" used by traditional fishermen.

Reports contrary to the same were wrong, he said and asked opposition members not to `politicise'' the issue.

He said about 400 to 500 traditional fishing country boats with more powerful engines and bigger than mechanised fishing boats had been kept ready to venture into the sea.

These actually belonged to mechanised fishing boat operators. The government had given instructions to prevent these boats from going to sea, Thomas said, adding that there was no need to adjourn the house and discuss the matter.

Moving the motion, Thomas Issac said tension prevailed in many areas in the coastal region, since traditional fishermen, plying country boats fitted with outboard engines, were also not allowed to put out to sea.

Ban violated: Over 30 traditional fishing boats, fitted with outboard engines, put out to sea from nearby Fort Kochi in the morning, violating the trawling ban and prohibitory orders.

The Ernakulam district collector, Gynanesh Kumar, has clamped prohibitory orders under Section 144 in the Fort Kochi area to prevent any untoward incidents. He has also ordered the police to take into custody, those who violate the ban and prohibitory orders.

22,Cong wins mayoral polls in Mangalore,"MANGALORE: Despite bitter opposition among the two factions of the Congress and hectic parleying all night on Sunday, the decision of the party high command finally prevailed, paving way for Shashidhar Hegde to be elected as the Mayor of Mangalore City Corporation for the first term of the newly-elected council.

The party showed a sense of unity despite internal rift to garner the post without any difficulty, leaving no room for the BJP to play their role in the process. The elections for the plum post was held at the special council meeting on Monday.

Shalini Salian was elected the Deputy Mayor, with token opposition from the Bharatiya Janata Party for the two posts.

Following hectic lobbying and several rounds of discussions between the various groups of party leaders and the observers, Nilakantappa and Prem Kumar, the corporators could not reach a concensus regarding finalising the candidate for the Mayoral post till late in Sunday night.

Following heated debates and advocacy to field their men, supporters of both factions (Poojary-Moily) refused to compromise, thus creating a stand-off.

The observers finally authorised the District Congress Committee to announce the official party candidates for the two posts. On Monday morning, despite stiff opposition, the party announced the name of Shashidhar Hegde, though no whip was given.

Dissatisfied with the decision, the group showing allegiance to Poojary remained firm on their stand to field Lancelot Pinto for the post despite an official party candidate.

The stand-off continued and both Hegde and Pinto filed their nominations on Monday morning. Meanwhile, BJP fielded Premanand Shetty as its candidate.

The next venue of action was the circuit house, where the group led by Lancelot met former Union minister B. Janardhan Poojary to get his final opinion on the matter. Sources close to Poojary informed that the group was furious and shouted slogans against Moily, district minister B. Ramanath Rai and others urged the former to allow them to contest, citing that they had clear cut majority to defeat Hegde.

However, Poojary pacified the party workers and asked them to obey the high command''s order.

After the council met again at 1 p.m., Lancelot Pinto withdrew his nomination paving way for his victory over his BJP rival. Hedge won by a margin of 49 to 16 votes during the elections.

In the elections for the post of Deputy Mayor, Shalini Salian representing the 16-Bengre Kulur ward defeated her rival from BJP, Rajni Dugganna by a similar margin. The candidature of Sesamma (Cong), who had also filed her nomination for the post was rejected following the scrutiny.

Divisional Commissioner of Mysore division, Basavaraju conducted the elections.
