1,Chauhan to launch party in Nov,"jalandhar:invoking the golden period in sikh history, jagjit singh chauhan, protagonist of a ""new khalistan"" through democratic means, declared on friday that a new party, khalsa raj party, would be formally launched on november 17 at jalandhar. ""if banda bahadur could raise an army of over 40,000 in just two and a half year's time to establish the khalsa raj in 1710 after the martyrdom of guru gobind singh, why can't we have the courage to dream and re-establish the same kingdom now. our dream is to have a punjab free of corruption, of communalism, poverty and joblessness. if, according to estimates,punjabis are sending back remittances worth 2000 million pounds why can't this potential be tapped to lay the foundation of a khalsa raj."" chauhan said the ""present constitution, as it is, has failed us. it is full of lofty words but hollow as far as effectiveness is concerned.the uk has an unwritten constitution and the american is a 10-page document that allows for greater freedom to member states. ours was altered and hijacked by jawaharlal nehru after the real constitution makers had formed it.we want a changed constitution.we also want to re-organise the state of punjab. we want included in it all those areas in haryana, rajasthan and himachal that were originally part of punjab.'' he went on to say that ""punjabis were given to believe that a loose federal structure would take shape and punjab would be free to rule in the north. but nothing of the sort happened. instead territory was snatched from us even though it was all punjabi-speaking.we want to re-organise the power structure. we shall accept nothing short of a sovereign state."" asked what means would be adopted by his party to achieve this new state, chauhan said: ""democratic means would be adopted.'' asked if his new party would participate in the coming elections, he said: ""we would certainly support a candidate if we feel he is deserving and honest.we have no intentions to participate actively.we have nothing in common with the panthic morcha of gurcharan singh tohra and simranjit singh mann. though mann is an honourable man, the panthic morcha too, like all other parties, wants to grab power.they are not going to change the system."" talking about parkash singh badal, chauhan said "" he has disappointed us.what use are these long flowing beards and turbans if amritdharis, which akalis claim to be, are indulging in corruption. even a chaprasi's post is sold for rs 3 lakh.

2,Cabinet finalises transparency law,"new delhi: as the city government enforces its much-touted right to information act this week, any official document or record that concerns the life of an ordinary delhiite will be made public. for instance, a resident fed up with the broken, sunken roads in his locality can go to the agency concerned and check the expenses incurred on maintaining the road. the information will be made public within a month by the department concerned on payment of rs 50. for business-related information like tender notices a fee of rs 500 will be levied by the department concerned. on friday, the cabinet finalised the rules for enforcement of the new law. officials said in another 10 days, when lt governor vijai kapoor's consent is sought, the law would be fully enforced. however, for official records, the act has already come into effect from october 2. the right to information act puts all city government records under public scrutiny. while the civic bodies are under the purview of the act, the delhi development authority and the delhi police, which are governed by the centre, remain outside its purview. the new act will give a citizen the right to seek any information that does not amount to unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, is not a trade or commercial secret, is not protected by law or constitutes a breach of privilege of parliament or the delhi vidhan sabha. also, cabinet papers, minutes of official meetings taken by the lt governor will not be made public. categorically stating that the right to information includes inspection of works, documents, records, taking notes and extracts and obtaining certified copies of documents or records, or taking samples of material, the act makes it mandatory for government departments to voluntarily part with all information. officials claim that it will give citizens the right to question all aspects of governance and policy decisions. for instance, if a contractor is not awarded a tender, he can ask the department concerned for an explanation. similarly, if a resident of delhi is denied a ration card or the promotion of an official is overdue, he will be within his rights to ask for justification. a delay in providing information will be liable to a fine of rs 50 for each day beyond the one-month deadline provided for in the act. the agency concerned would have to pay the fine to the applicant. if the information given by the government agency is found to be incorrect, it will be liable to a penalty of rs 1,000 per application. also, a citizen has the right to appeal to the public grievance commission. the government also plans to put an electronic system in place for imparting information on the internet.

3,Rabri govt’s stability hinges on Laloo’s presence at hand,"patna: the bravado shown by rjd chief laloo prasad yadav notwithstanding, the decision of the apex court has come as a major blow to him in terms of wider political ramifications, specially for the reason that nda leaders, till recently, had been working overtime to topple the rabri devi government. the supreme court's decision means that 36 cases will be heard in jharkhand. laloo prasad yadav will not enjoy the same facilities as he enjoys here. however, i do not favour politicisation of the cases. the judiciary must ensure speedy, but, at the same time, fair trial, said senior lawyer shyama prasad mukherjee. in bihar, the state government has failed to set up more cbi courts for speedy trial of the fodder scam cases. in jharkhand, the state government has already set up seven courts for speedy trial, including one in dumka. while the report regarding apex court order spread like wild fire, the question being asked was: when will laloo go to jail? although the apex court has not delivered its verdict on this, everybody knows it is just a matter of time, remarked an rjd minister. ever since the cbi moved to seek clearance from the governor in the fodder case number rc-47 a, laloo has been crying foul. they are threatening to lock me up in a jharkhand jail and keep me without a mobile phone. this government (rabri government) will survive without a mobile phone, he stressed before mediapersons, while senior rjd mp raghuvansh prasad singh alleged a conspiracy to eliminate laloo in jharkhand. the fear of rjd leaders hinges on the fact that running the rabri government may become difficult if laloo is deprived of the phone facility. during laloo's last four stays in a patna jail, ministers and seior bureaucrats would rush to him. lalooji is the chief of the party and we are justified in going to jail to seek his advice, said his close confidant and parliamentary affairs minister ram chandra purbey. during his previous tenure in jail, laloo had actually intervened to end autorickshaw-pullers' strike in patna, insiders say. now, laloo in a jharkhand jail means that day-to-day monitoring of the rabri government by the rjd chief would become impossible. for, rabri devi, despite being in power for over four years, remains essentially a housewife and has shown no inclination towards governance. she, recently, told a tv channel that she wished to quit and look after her children. the rjd rank and file appeared worried that laloo will have to spend more time in jharkhand. the court may exempt him from personal appearance since he is a prominent politician and has to give his appearance in so many cases, said a hopeful rjd minister. accordingly, laloo's absence is likely to effect politics more than the administration of the government because his trusted official mukund prasad is state's chief secretary. now, laloo will have to spend more than half his time in jharkhand, appearing before various courts in different cases, said an rjd mla. however, it would be very difficult for the state government to justify the use of the state-owned plane and chopper for laloo to make his appearance in jharkhand courts. with laloo more engaged in legal wrangles his grip over the party is likely to weaken, remarked an rjd mla. in may, his friend-turned-foe ranjan yadav had openly threatened to engineer defection of 39 mlas from the rjd if laloo went to jail. a supreme court order staying the non-bailable warrant issued by the ranchi cbi court foiled the game. even in the present situation, chances of ranjan being able to carry out the threat are remote, but the anxiety in the rjd has returned. once again, the nda will raise questions about the stability of the rabri devi government in the absence of laloo.

5,Poll panel asks govt to transfer officers,"patna: prior to receiving any instruction from the state government to hold municipal corporation, municipality and notified area committee elections, the state election commission (sec) has directed the government to transfer two divisional commissioners, eight dms, three sdos and about a dozen administrative officers with immediate effect. the officers whose transfer has been sought by the sec include the commissioners of munger and bhagalpur divisions, m a ibrahim and u k nanda respectively, the dms of bhojpur, east champaran, gopalganj, nalanda, nawada, purnia, rohtas and sheikhpura, sudhir kumar, hira lal, s m raju, chanchal kumar, sheonandan ram, arun kumar singh, m w anjum and parmanand rai respectively, the sdos of biraul, udakishunganj and simri bakhtiarpur and the sdpo of simri bakhtiarpur and benipur. in a letter sent recently to chief secretary mukund prasad, sec secretary suman kumar said these officers were found to be partial or biased, inactive and indulging in or promoting illegal acts during the panchayat elections and hence the sec is of the view that free and fair municipal elections are not possible till they are not kept away from election-related work. they should be transferred to such posts which have nothing to do with the municipal elections even if they are kept in the same districts, the letter added. according to the tentative programme announced by state election commissioner m l majumdar at a press conference here on september 21, the sec is to hold elections to municipal corporations, municipalities and notified area committees on march 19 and complete the election process by march 25. he had made it clear that in view of their conducts during the recent panchayat polls, transfer of some dms was essential in order to ensure free and fair municipal elections and that unless his request for transfer of these dms was conceded before filing of nomination papers, he would not hold municipal elections in the districts concerned. he had threatened to keep municipal elections in these districts pending till their dms were removed from the election-related work. when contacted, majumdar admitted on friday that he has sent such a letter to the state government. he told times news network that he still holds the same view with regard to transfer of the divisional commissioners, dms and other officers as he had stated at his september 21 press conference.

6,Making a sound investment in TVs,"bangalore: after a decent run with matrix, the premium flat colour television (ctv) range, bpl ltd is turning its attention to its flagship sub-brand for the conventional colour picture tube market, studio line. starting with the india-south africa one-day international cricket telecast on espn on october 5, the company is launching a rs 7-crore, 8-week tv advertising campaign for studio line, a range that was launched in july this year. anand narasimha, bpl's head of corporate brand management, told the times of india that the company intended to give some high intensity support to the range. ``the initial response to studio line from the market has been overwhelming. this festival season, we'll have an ad blitz focussed on it,'' he said. studio line is a range of tvs that delivers 1,000 watts pmpo, a level of sound which bpl says has not been given on any tv anywhere in the world. it also comes with the company's proprietary quadra point focus picture technology. the range comes in 21'', 25'', 29'' and 34'' and is priced between rs 18,000 and rs 45,000. while the print ads so far had focussed on the tvs' sound capacity (the next highest is onida ky thunder with 650 watts), the tv campaign will emphasise more generally the quality of sound and picture. ``1000 watts is a good tactical ploy, but it cannot be an enduring proposition for a tv because somebody else may some day come out with a higher sound level tv,'' narasimha said. the fresh thrust from bpl comes at a time when ctv sales have taken a knock and advertising spends have dropped markedly. after a dull 2000 and an equally dull beginning this year, sales had seen a pickup in july and august. but september is once again believed to have witnessed a sharp slowdown. ``in this dull and highly competitive market, protecting marketshare is itself an important objective. we are already selling 10,000 units of studio line a month and we want to take that to 15,000 units a month,'' narasimha said.

8,Marandi govt for consensus on amending tenancy laws,"jamshedpur: the bubulal marandi regime appears treading cautiously on amending the chotanagpur and the santhal pargana tenancy act and the government is keen on building a consensus on the contentious issue. state industry minister p n singh recently hosted an all-party meeting on the issue that can snowball into a major controversy. both the acts were framed during the colonial rule to ensure adivasis' rights on the land. many political and voluntary groups have voiced their opposition to any bid to dilute the two tenancy laws. legal protection for tribal land, they say, was imperative as the survival of the adivasi population still depends on their land. but, the industry minister argues, the stringent provisions of the tenancy rules may have to be amended to boost industrial growth in the state. we ought to build roads and railway network, if we want industrial development. there has to be land for constructing all this. the political parties agree that land must be available for industrial purpose, singh claims. at the dumka meeting, almost all leaders were of the view that industrial development was essential, he added.the government, however, would first frame a rehabilitation policy before amending the tenancy laws. we are conscious about the fact that industrialisation has contributed to land alienation among the adivasi. the rehabilitation will be worked out for the benefit of the displaced people. but, first there has to be consensus on amending the tenancy laws. the minister said steps have been initiated to set up land banks for industrial purpose in all the districts. the deputy commissioners have to be directed to submit the details of government lands in their districts. the land banks would be registered under the society act. the government also has relaxed the procedure for land clearance for the mining lease. the industry department would now recommend for lease for captive mines. asked about the renewal of tata steel's land lease in jamshedpur, singh said a three-member committee headed by industry director a k singh has been set up to ascertain the actual land requirement of the company.

15,Gods preempt govt’s prayers,"visakhapatnam: man proposes, god disposes. driven to despair at the unrelenting drought affecting the state this year, the government decided to invite divine intervention: accordingly, the endowments department directed the executive officers of all temples in its jurisdiction to perform special abhishekams (rites) on oct. 7 to invoke the blessings of the rain god to save the farming community from the drought. it also granted rs 5,000 per temple for this purpose. according to officials of the endowments department, the decision was taken in view of the drought conditions prevailing across much of the state. but as providence would have it, by the time the executive officers of all siva temples in the state received the circular, the state has been experiencing torrential rains. we will still continue our prayers, said an official. endowments officials have made arrangements for the rituals at six siva temples in vizag. all priests were asked to get ready with the required inputs'' for the abhishekams scheduled for on sunday. however, temple executive officers as well as priests say that the paltry grant of rs 5,000 would not be sufficient for such rituals.

17,The prince grows up,"gwalior: it took just a week for the fun-loving yuvraj to grow up. all the regulars at the rani mahal in the jai vilas palace agreed on this as they saw jyotiraditya go about his business after the sudden death of his father 'maharaj' madhavrao scindia. seeing the slender, compactly-built 31-year-old prince supervise the funeral arrangements was a lesson in fortitude. he did not betray any trace of the emotional trauma he had undergone. ''there is a steely side to him which may have just begun to show,'' said state minister mahendra singh kalukhera, among the most trusted lieutenants of madhavrao. jyotiraditya was in mumbai when the tragic news reached him. most people would have panicked. instead, the prince sought more details and immediately went about planning what to do next. it was he who later broke the news to his mother. murli deora, president, maharashtra regional congress committee, who accompanied him to mumbai airport soon after he heard the news says, ''throughout the ride he was composed.'' the prince has grown up well, says raja digvijay singh, who knows the family only too well. missing from jyotiraditya's life so far have been the usual elements associated with sons of the rich and privileged. says deora, ''we've known him for a long time. in fact, just last week he had dinner with us. he is a young man who shows great promise, is both intelligent and dynamic. he is informed about, and has views on a whole range of subjects from enron to flyovers to industrialisation. he can discuss politics, the economy and george bush.'' a schoolmate from doon school however admits that jyotiraditya's ''impatience'' with the older generation may have earned him some disrepute, ''but he means well, and he is devoid of malice, much like his dad. and he was never a playboy.'' jyotiraditya got into both harvard and stanford on his own steam. he was later apprenticed with morgan stanley, and also had stints with the un and world bank. married into the gaekwad family, jyotiraditya has a five-year-old son and is involved in managing the holding company for all scindia-owned properties. while in school, jyotiraditya was captain of the archery team, and a strong swimmer, remembers the friend. somewhere along the line, he also became a wildlife freak and the corbett national park became his favourite haunt. interestingly, madhavrao's son also has a passion for ghalib's verse, with a fair understanding of the poet's more abstruse persian usages. though the yuvraj will turn maharaj after a formal pugdi-tying ceremony later this month, kalukhera says jyotiraditya has refused to be designated maharaj as has been the custom. the prince appears to have his head squarely on his shoulders.

18,No water at hostel since 6 days,"vadodara: resident medical students of the new rmo hostel of the baroda medical college here were a harried lot. since the past six days now, the hostelites were contending with a complete lack of water supply thanks to the apathy of the pwd and vmc officials. students of the hostel complained that there was no water in toilets, and the hostel mess has to make do with the 3,000 litres of water supplied through a vmc tanker both for drinking purposes and for cooking. the vmc has cut the water supply of the hostel following a breach in the water pipeline belonging to the public works department pwd and have issued a notice to the pwd to repair the line so that the water supply can be resumed.

19,Intelligence alarm as Bihar govt soft on SIMI,"patna: intelligence agencies are worried over the indifferent attitude adopted by the state government towards the activities of the students islamic movement of india, banned by the union government recently. the state government's response has been so slow that the first arrests of simi acivists in bihar were made only on saturday, eight days after the centre banned the outfit. curiously, the three arrested simi activists claimed that they had courted arrest. the slow response can trigger an inflow of dubious characters preaching fundamentalism and sub-nationalism among youths, said a highly-placed intelligence source, adding that the government's inaction has sent a clear message that bihar remains a safe haven for such characters. these elements can also get a safe passage to nepal, he added. these concerns have been conveyed to the union home ministry in a recent report, the source said. bihar, where recruits of hizbul mujahideen, persons linked to the world's most wanted terrorist osama bin laden and accused of the coimbatore blast case have been nabbed, is already a safe hideout for such characters, the source said. according to intelligence reports, siwan was the first place in the country where a procession in favour of bin laden was taken out with the consent of an rjd leader. concerns over the influx of suspicious characters have been raised also due to the increase in the number of madarsas along the 750-km bihar-nepal border. not all of them are suspected of harbouring terrorists and anti-nationals. quite a few of them are genuinely engaged in philanthropic causes, remarked an intelligence official. however, the number of madarsas suspected of being engaged in dubious activities is alarming. on the indian side, the tauheed educational trust based at kishanganj has been alleged to spread fundamentalism, help bangladeshi nationals in illegal settlement and adopting a sectarian attitude. though its fcra facility has been suspended by the union home ministry, it is suspected of receiving foreign funds through hawala transaction from gulf countries, intelligence sources say. according to the sources, another suspected centre, based at chandanbara in east champaran and called madarsa jamia ibn taimiya, is alleged to receive funds from saudi arabia and has been accused of spreading fundamentalism. yet another suspected centre, madarsa tazweedul quran in east champaran, is also reported to be receiving huge funds through hawala transactions from saudi arabia. the scene on the nepal side is even more alarming. intelligence sources refer to the existence of madarsa hanifa jamia, in bara district, which is visited by suspicious characters. madarsa hussainia islamia in the same district is suspected of sheltering trans-border criminals and smugglers. yet another madarsa in the same district, bishambharpur madarsa, is also suspected of sheltering criminals and smugglers and having links with pakistan's embassy in kathmandu. in routahat district of nepal, intelligence sources hint towards madarsa thingarwa, which is suspected of recruiting muslim youths for arms training and providing shelter to kashmiri militants. in mahottary district, there exists madarsa hussaina simardahi which is suspected of having links with the pakistan embassy.
