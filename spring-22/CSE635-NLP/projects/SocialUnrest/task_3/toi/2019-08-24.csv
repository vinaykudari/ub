0,Punjab govt yet to define ADG Sidiqqui’s work,"CHANDIGARH:Even after a fortnight of his joining, the state government is yet to define what precisely would be the brief of additional director general A. Sidiqqui, who is designated as OSD (Law and Order). Sidiqquiâ€™s services were requisitioned by the Amarinder government from the Centre where he was on deputation for the past two and a half years.

Though he has been brought back on a specially-created post, the government, however, has not yet deciphered his role as an OSD (law and Order).

In fact, unlike UP and Bihar where there are regular posts for law and order, Punjab never had officers on this post on a regular basis.

The first officer to occupy this office was PS Bhinder, who was appointed IG (law and order) way back in 1983. As an IG he exercised almost all powers of the DGP. He had all zonal IGs, DIGs and district police chiefs reporting to him directly. After he moved to the Centre, the post stood dissolved.

Later, KPS Gill was appointed as additional director general (law and order) with J Riberio as his chief. He did not wield as much powers as Bhinder did, but he played a significant role in supervising the crime scene which had assumed serious dimensions due to rise of militancy.

After Gill, Sidiqqui is the next police officer who has been entrusted with the undefined task of looking after law and order. Though he has found an office in the state police headquarters, it has not yet been decided whether he would report to the home secretary or the state DGP. Though he functioned as DG, Manipur, during his period of deputation to the Centre, the chief minister has already clarified that his status in the state would remain that of an ADGP. With ADGP (Crime), ADGP (Operations) and ADGP (Security) already functioning, Sidiqquiâ€™s job would surely be overlap with theirs unless the government clearly outlines their role.

According to sources, the delay in assigning task to Sidiqqui is a fall-out of the state governmentâ€™s indecision on whether he should continue to hold the post or be handed over the Vigilance Bureau task. There has been speculation that Sidiqqui might be shifted to the VB. But given the fact that the present incumbent AP Pandey has already been given a pat by chief minister Amarinder Singh for spearheading the anti-corruption campaign diligently, the change-over might not take place.

1,Women's bodies let down riot-rape victims,"AHMEDABAD: When the rape cases first came to light in the initial days of the communal violence in Gujarat, many thought the state''s acclaimed women''s organisations would not let the issue die down.

The impression was that these NGOs, many of them having national and international repute, would unite for the cause.

Unfortunately, just the opposite happened. Some organisations have started bickering among themselves. Tension was apparently sparked off by an e-mail circulated internally among friends by an organisation.

It expressed concern over a reported survey carried out by the reputed Self Employed Women''s Association (SEWA) claiming that there were no rape cases during the riots.

The e-mail says, ""This committee on atrocities on women is submitting its report on Gujarat saying; there were no rapes - based on a survey by SEWA, which claims to have taken interviews of 1,000 women. Most of us know that we have records of witnesses and that many women rape victims have retracted. There are hardly any FIRs, but based on the testimonies and affidavits, available with many of us, we should object to this kind of irresponsible and callous report by official committees. It is unfortunate that, as women''s groups and human rights groups, we are not in position to register our protests in a way that makes impact on these state stooges.""

SEWA general secretary Reema Nanavati denied the very existence of the report. ""We never conducted such a survey,"" she said. Such rumours are being deliberately spread by organisations who want to malign our clean image.""

In such a scenario, the National Commission for Women (NCW) could have played a pivotal role in enabling the women to seek justice. But it has already hit a dead-end.

Besides making recommendations to the state government, it has done precious little. NCW also failed to make its much-promised second visit to the riot-affected state in July.

""We have not heard a word from the government about follow-up action on individual cases,"" conceded Reva Nayyar, member secretary of the NCW.

""Of course, the government has been sending us information on cash doles being disbursed, on the number of relief camps closed and those still functioning, and other general reports, but there is no accurate information on the follow-ups.""

Despite the National Human Rights Commission''s ''in-your-face'' approach in taking on the state government, the NCW remained tangled in bureaucratic hassles. ""Law and order is a state subject after all. Ultimately, we will have to depend on the state government to take action,"" says Nayyar.

Sheba George, who has been co-ordinating the efforts of the NGOs in Ahmedabad, blames both the NCW and the home ministry''s special women''s cell, which has remained silent after hearing numerous eye-witness accounts.

George had herself led a delegation of the cell to New Delhi. ""What is the point if they are not proactive and do something based on the information they gathered?"" she asks.

Ila Pathak of Ahmedabad Women''s Action Group (AWAG) concedes that they tried to chip in, but were stonewalled. ""Victims were not forthcoming. The reluctance was especially felt when we offered legal assistance,"" says Pathak.

2,Civic discipline spills over to party politics,"KOLKATA: The scene at the Kolkata Municipal Corporation headquarters on Friday was reminiscent of the worst days of unionism.

The latest spat between two Trinamul heavyweights - mayor Subrata Mukherjee and party chief whip Sobhandeb Chatterjee - snowballed into a minor crisis when the latterâ€™s supporters stormed the civic headquarters.

The KMC gates were hastily closed and policemen took position in riot gear to prevent unruly Trinamul men from entering the building.

The mob was protesting against the mayorâ€™s decision to issue a show-cause notice to Chatterjee for allegedly roughing up KMC commissioner Debashis Som and the suspension of five members of the KMC Employees and Workersâ€™ Union for participating in processions during office hours.

The irony of the situation was unmistakable as the mayor was well within his rights. Chatterjee is a KMC employee and works as deputy security officer and the mayor, as his â€˜bossâ€™, was only taking disciplinary action by issuing the formal show-cause notice.

Both the leaders have complained to party supremo Mamata Banerjee. Harassed as she is over the rail bifurcation issue, Mamata has declined to comment on â€˜trade union mattersâ€™.

An infuriated Sobhandeb minced no words in calling the mayor a â€˜puppet of the CPM and a populist self-seekerâ€™.

â€œHe did not bother to discuss the issue within the party and refused to consider my legislative position. He is more interested in making the CPM happy at the cost of Trinamul,â€� he charged.

The mayor, however, remained firm. â€œMy decision is purely administrative. As KMC security officer, Sobhandeb cannot rough up his superior. Trinamul supporters might have felt happy if I had not taken action. But I am accountable to 10 million citizens of Kolkata,â€� The commissioner had complained to the mayor in writing and sought leave.

â€œI cannot allow processions during office hours. There are 61 trade unions in the KMC. Those days of slogan-shouting during working hours are over,â€™â€™ he maintained.

Sobhandeb was quick to remind Subrata about his â€˜rabble-rousing daysâ€™. â€œHe tore down the telephone lines, vandalised the Grand Hotel, beat up policemen when he was a labour leader. He should not teach us discipline,â€™â€™ he said.

But pat came the mayorâ€™s reply, â€œI was never a security officer in any organisation.â€�

3,Kalam's intervention fails to help riot victim,"AHMEDABAD: Mohammad Yasin (15) had thought his nightmare would come to an end when a visibly moved President APJ Abdul Kalam instructed Chief Minister Narendra Modi to immediately follow-up his case during a visit to Haj House on August 11.

One of the handful of people who got an opportunity to personally narrate his woes to Kalam during his Ahmedabad visit, Yasin told the President how he, despite sustaining severe burn injuries on the face, hands and legs in the LPG-cylinder blast triggered by the mob on March 1, was forced to go without adequate medical treatment for the past five months. ""Please do something, Sir. I need medical care,"" Yasin pleaded before him.

Kalam''s word led to instant action. The district collector was asked to follow-up the case and he had the entire health machinery digging for Yasin''s medical records. Yasin was even personally escorted to the VS Hospital by a doctor!

But that was just about it. Less than two weeks after Kalam''s visit, the dream sequence has ended abruptly and reality is biting into Yasin''s wounds again as he lies still on a small bed in a dingy room in his grandfather''s house in Darji ni Chali in Saraspur.

""No one is really helping us. The hospital authorities are not even giving us the correct disability certificate... they are adamant on giving a disability certificate for just 28 per cent burns while it is clearly mentioned in his medical reports that he had sustained 53 per cent burns,"" says Yasin''s uncle Anis Ahmad, a tailor by profession.

Ahmad accused the authorities of shunting them from one doctor to another for three hours but refused to give them the ''right'' certificate.

Hospital authorities, however, said, ""According to the guidelines given to us, his percentage of disability comes to 28 per cent only. We have no intention of discriminating against the patient,"" insisted resident medical officer Dinesh Chandana.

Meanwhile, Yasin and family are nursing a grudge against the doctors and allege they were not given proper treatment.

""After I was admitted in the hospital, for the first three days I was given no treatment. No one was bothered as other burns'' victims in my room succumbed to their injuries,"" says Yasin.

He added, ""The circumstances were such that we could trust no one. We remained there for ten days but decided to leave after two patients died on being given blood transfusion. Yasin is doing without adequate treatment ever since,"" says Ahmad, citing the family''s inability to admit him in a private hospital due to financial constraints.

Yasin is the eldest of the four children of a small-time factory worker, Naimuddin Ansari.

Doctors, however, have refused to take the blame. ""His reports show that he chose to leave the hospital against medical advice. He had also given a written statement saying he was satisfied with the treatment but was leaving due to the atmosphere prevailing in the city,"" claims a senior doctor.

Charges and counter-charges, however, will make little difference to Yasin. Lack of proper medical treatment has left him with burn scars that could have been avoided.

""Yasin is lucky that his wounds have healed... if the 57 per cent burns had not been properly attended to, it could have proved fatal,"" says a doctor. Little solace for a 15-year old doomed to live a scarred life.

4,Arrested youth’s father dies of cardiac arrest,"HYDERABAD: A 53-year-old person, Samuel David, suffered heart attack and died at Somajiguda late on Thursday after the Central Crime Station personnel allegedly kept his son facing charges in a cheating case under illegal detention.

According Samuelâ€™s family, the white collar offence wing of the CCS picked up Praveen David for questioning in a cheating case on August 21. Samuel went to the CCS on August 22 morning, and stayed there till evening, pleading with the officials to release his son.

The family said an exasperated Samuel returned home late in the evening, and sustained a severe heart attack in the evening. The family members alleged that Samuel died because of the police harassment.

Police sources said Praveen David was arrested by the Panjagutta police two months ago in connection with a cheating case. Praveen started a software firm and reportedly duped several people.

Based on complaints, the Panjagutta police remanded him to judicial custody. Recently, Praveen secured bail and was released from the prison.

The sources said a fresh case was registered against Praveen in the CCS on August 13, and he was detained in connection with the same case.

When contacted, additional police commissioner (crimes) M Alagar said he was not aware of the death of Samuel. He, however, promised to enquire the circumstances leading to death of Samuel.

6,Ex-health minister granted bail,"PATNA: A single bench of the Patna High Court, presided by Justice Narayan Roy, on Friday granted bail to another former health minister Dilkeshwar Ram, who was an accused in a case related to illegal appointments made in the leprosy eradication department for pecuniary gains. Earlier, in an identical case, former health minister Mahabir Prasad has already been granted bail by the high court.

It was alleged that the petitioner, in the capacity of the health minister, connived with the other accused persons and officials of the health department and appointed several persons on the non-medical posts without advertising the same. While these appointments were made for pecuniary benefits, Ram was the health minister in 1988 for seven months, the prosecution maintained. For the last three months, he has been in the jail under judicial custody.

Earlier, moving the bail petition, defence counsel P N Pandey submitted before the bench that the petitioner in no way was instrumental in the illegal appointments to different posts. On the contrary, in the capacity of the health minister, he had issued certain directions, which should not be deemed as an act in furtherance of the criminal conspiracy. Opposing the bail petition, CBI counsel Rakesh Kumar said prima facie, the materials collected in course of the investigation showed involvement of the petitioner, too, in the illegal appointments made in the health department.

Life term for three: Fast track court judge Chandra Shekhar Sharma on Friday sentenced three accused â€” Baleshwar Yadav, Ramashish Yadav and Sudershan Yadav of Akhtiyarpur village â€” to life imprisonment in connection with a murder case. The accused were charged with making a murderous attack on their co-villagers, Chotan Ram and his wife Kaushalya. While Kaushalya died on the spot, Chotan survived despite receiving bullet injuries.

First class judicial magistrate B B Singh on Friday sentenced former cashier, Bihar legislative council, Premnarayan to three-year imprisonment and also slapped a fine of Rs 5,000 on him in the case of embezzlement of cash. He was sentenced under sections 467, 468, 461 and 409 of the IPC.

The cashier was found guilty of embezzlement of fund by an audit team and on the basis of it the deputy secretary of council, Lalan Prasad, had lodged an FIR against the accused. Prosecution was represented by special public prosecutor Suryadeo Yadav and the APP, Sudhir K Sinha.

7,Shourie briefs BJP think-tank on disinvestment,"NEW DELHI: In a concerted bid to remove apprehensions within the BJP on government''s on-going privatisation process, Disinvestment Minister Arun Shourie on Saturday briefed the party''s think-tank on its merits and claimed there was a ""consensus in practice"" on the issue.

Addressing members of the party''s intellectual cell here, the journalist-turned-politician said the implementation of the government''s disinvestment policy has shown the benefits of privatisation to tax payers, economy, stock market and employees.

While a sick unit like Modern Foods had doubled its sales in the first quarter of the year itself after disinvestment, there has been a wage revision up to Rs 2090 per worker per month in units such as Paradip Phosphates after the Birlas took over, he said, according to party sources.

""Of the 31 (disinvestment) transactions in the past 18 months, two-thirds were of loss making units,"" he said, responding to a question from a participant that the public perception was that profit-making public sector units were being privatised.

According to sources, Shourie said the big industrial houses have created very powerful lobbies in the government over the years. ""Their tentacles reach right into our heart,"" he reportedly said.

Sangh Parivar outfits, including the Swadeshi Jagran Manch and Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh have been highly critical of the g''s disinvestment policy. Even several party MPs in the past had raised apprehensions about disinvestment of PSUs such as Balco.

8,"NDA govt scam-tainted, communal, says Sonia","NEW DELHI: Congress President Sonia Gandhi on Saturday said the ""scam-ridden and communal"" NDA government was ""neckdeep"" in corruption, which despite being headed by ""two leaders"" had failed to hold any minister accountable for the series of scandals.

Addressing a rally as part of the Congress'' public awareness campaign on ""misdeeds"" of government, she said the BJP, which came to power posing as ""patriots"" has exposed itself as ""power hungry"" unwilling to take action against those guilty of corruption.

""Ek Sarkar me do do sardar, phir bhi koi nahi jimmedar"", (one government with two leaders, but no one is being held responsible), Gandhi quipped in Hindi to a responsive audience while hitting out at Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani.

Sonia, who is also the leader of Opposition, held the BJP squarely responsible for spreading ""communal poison"" in Gujarat after ""misgovernance"" of four and half years. She said that the ruling party had done this as its very existence was threatened.

Referring to the attack on Chief Election Commissioner J M Lyngdoh by Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi and a number of BJP leaders, Sonia said they were raising fingers against constitutional bodies.

9,EC declares Baramulla sensitive for polls,"BARAMULLA: With the threat of militants seeking to disrupt the Assembly polls in Jammu and Kashmir looming large, authorities in this north Kashmir border district have declared all the ten constituencies sensitive and hypersensitive.

""We are taking no chances in view of the militants'' threat to disrupt polls in the state. We have declared all the constituencies as sensitive or hypersensitive,"" Naveen Choudhry, District Election Officer for Baramulla, told visiting reporters on Saturday.

Asked how elections could be held if the security situation was so bad, he replied, ""A normal constituency classification would mean deployment of no security forces for election duty and we cannot take that chance.""

Detailing on poll preparations in the district, the elections official said 752 polling stations have been set up for a total electorate of 5,51,753.

""Eight additional polling stations have been put up in the district besides declubbing of polling stations for the convenience of voters. The polling stations are now situated at 701 places against 393 in 1999 parliamentary elections,"" he said.

Polling stations had been clubbed in the 1996 Assembly elections in view of security situation at that time.

According to the district election officer, the size of the electorate in the district has swelled by 14,000 as against 57,000 applications received for inclusion in the voters list.

He said voter slips after finalising the electoral rolls would be distributed to every household with the aim of educating the people about the status of eligible voters in the family.

The election officials have also been imparted training in the use of electronic voting machines (EVMS), which will be used in the state for the first time, he said.

""From today, we have started a campaign in which we would take the EVMs to villages and far-flung areas to familiarise the public with them"", he added.

Choudhry admitted that issuance of Electoral photo-identity cards had been temporarily stopped due to paucity of paper.

""For the last few days we have not been able to issue any cards as the paper which was to be acquired from Nasik, has exhausted. But from Sunday we will start issuing the cards again"", he added.

10,Export zones for farm produce demanded,"KOTTAYAM: Kerala Congress (J) leader and MLA P C George on Saturday asked the state government to obtain the Centre''s approval for setting up at least half-a-dozen export processing zones for farm produce in the state.

Speaking to newsmen here, he said he was shocked to see the reported statement of Union Minister Rajiv Pratap Rudy recently that the Kerala government had not done anything tangible to get allotment of export processing zones while neighbouring states like Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh got a few of them established in their areas.

George said the Kerala government should also announce a three-year moratorium on bank loans taken by farmers, reduce interest rates for agricultural loans upto Rs.3 lakh, and provide free power for farm work and processing zones.

12,21 hurt in Bagalkot riot,"HUBLI: At least 15 villagers and six police personnel, including Bagalkot deputy superintendent of police, were injured in a communal clash that broke out in a village of Bagalkot district on Saturday morning.

Reports reaching here said the police fired in the air and lobbed tear-gas shells to disperse the mob indulging in violence in Kamatagi village of Bagalkot.

In the melee late on Friday evening that spilled over into the early hours of Saturday, two places of worship in the village were damaged and more than a score of villagers and police personnel suffered injuries.

Bagalkot Superintendent of Police N.R. Nadumani said situation in riot-hit areas had been brought under control and patrolling intensified.

Twenty-five persons have been taken into custody and prohibitory orders under Section 144 of the CrPC have been clamped on the village.

Police said clashes broke out over differences on removing steps leading to a place of worship in the road-widening work. Taking advantage of the altercation, some miscreants wrought damage to two places of worship in the village and set a tea stall on fire, the police said.

The road-widening work, taken up under the Nirmala Grama Yojana, has eaten into the front steps of many houses in the village.

13,IGP Sharma’s friend takes out rally in his defence,"KURUKSHETRA: Relatives, friends and hundreds of residents of Shahbad Markanda, the native town of suspended IGP Haryana RK Sharma, prime accused in the murder of journalist Shivani Bhatnagar, took out a procession on Saturday here to protest against â€˜â€˜the high-handedness of the Delhi policeâ€™â€™.

The residents alleged that RK Sharma was being falsely implicated in the murder case under a political conspiracy.

This, they claimed, was clear from the fact that Sharma was declared a most wanted criminal and an award of Rs 50,000 was announced on information of his whereabouts within three days by the Delhi police. Sharmaâ€™s old parental house Sewa Sadan still exists in Anand Gali of the town where his aunt Susheela Sharma lives alone. A Delhi Police team visited the house some time back and made inquiries from the tenants living in this house. Ravi Kant still owns ancestral agricultural land in the adjoining village Deag.

Locals here seem to be in awe of the Sharma family, and never tire of praising good deeds done by his grandfather, Raghunandan Lal Sharma, who was a government officer under the British rule and his father JD Sharma, an IAS officer who later on became the vicechancellor of Jammu University. This family reputation has been destroyed in three daysâ€™ time, they bemoaned.

As a proof of his goodness which seems to run in the family, Sharmaâ€™s neighbour Sanjiv Aggarwal asked how someone from a family who looks after around 250 orphans (Bal Niketan, an orphanage at Sector 2, Panchkula, which is being looked after by Madhu Sharma) can be involved in such a crime. The protesters demanded a CBI inquiry into the murder case and damned Delhi police with slogans like â€˜â€˜Dilli police hai hai.â€™â€™ They demanded Union parliamentary affairs minister Pramod Mahajanâ€™s resignation.

14,Riot victims the govt couldn't trace,"AHMEDABAD: When Chief Election Commissioner J M Lyngdoh toured the riot-hit areas of the city, there was a section of victims whom he could not meet even after visiting their homes.

They were the occupants of the Delite, Elite, Tarana and Kazmi apartment blocks in Paldi area.

These residential quarters, which today wear a haunted and devastated look, were looted, vandalised and burnt down by riotous mobs on and after February 28.

Lyngdoh was told by the state authorities on August 9 that the occupants of these multi-storeyed buildings were untraceable. But TNN tracked down some of these riot victims now staying in different corners of Ahmedabad, living like refugees in their hometown.

""I would like to go back to my home, but I would need some company there and of course security. I and my wife cannot live in an empty flat in a hostile neighbourhood,"" said Iqbalbhai Valiullah, who owns a flat in Tarana Apartments.

Valiullah now lives in Sarkhej. His love for Ahmedabad prevents him from migrating to the US and live a contented, retired life with his two sons, who are already there.

Aftab Kadri, an advocate, can never forget the last few hours he spent at his dream home in Kazmi Apartment. Today Kazmi wears a haunted look. Walls blackened by soot, homes charred and ransacked beyond recognition stand testimony of the riots.

""I now stay with my relatives in the Gaekwad Haveli area. My house was among the first ones to be burnt. All the 12 flat owners left Kazmi Apartment on February 28 afternoon. Now I feel insecure and frightened whenever I visit my destroyed home,"" said Kadri.

In the same locality is Delight Apartment, which sports an outward appearance of normalcy. But on a closer look one can find the burn marks, broken window panes and an eerie silence enveloping the deserted apartment.

A solitary watchman sitting near its locked metal door says, ""One family is readying to come back. They are getting the burnt electricity lines repaired.""

Yunus Bhavnagri, a flat owner of Delite Apartment, who now stays in Kochrab area, said, ""I have been threatened by the VHP. I will never return to Delite.""

His son was injured in a private firing at Paldi on February 28. Bhavnagri himself is accused of firing at the mob, which killed two persons. He says that he fired in self-defence and to save the lives of those staying in the apartment.

And at a stone''s throw from Delite are the twin blocks of Elite Apartment. Elite is the only apartment to which four families have returned. However, occupant Naz B Ujjaini says, ""We came back on August 15. But, we do not feel safe here anymore. As soon as we get a good price for our flat, we would sell it and move to a safer location.""

15,"J&K polls risky business, say envoys","NEW DELHI: While independent observers are an absolute no-no, the government has made a small concession in allowing envoys from various embassies to visit Jammu and Kashmir and assess the ground situation in the state before the the elections.

At least four teams of diplomats â€” the European Troika headed by Danish First Secretary Signe Ropke, French, British and Canadian â€” travelled to the Valley in recent weeks. So, are conditions conducive for elections?

â€˜â€˜It is not for us to decide. Itâ€™s for the Election Commission. We areâ€” I wonâ€™t use the word â€˜observersâ€™ since the Indian government doesnâ€™t like it â€”allowed only to watch. On the basis of my limited interaction with journalists, officials and representatives of political parties all I can say is that the situation is very difficult. Those participating in the elections are very brave people. They are taking a big risk,â€™â€™ says James Carrick, Canadian First Secretary.

And is the Hurriyat being obdurate in not participating? â€˜â€˜They have certain policies and goals. The elections are within that framework. Itâ€™s their choice, what can we say, â€˜â€™ he brushes aside the question.

First Secretary Political, British High Commission, David Quarrey, is even more cautious: â€˜â€˜We hope for maximum possible participation and welcome the measures being put in place by the Election Commission.â€™â€™

â€˜â€˜Weâ€™ll speak our mind in our report but it will be strictly confidential. Our aim is to help bring peace in the region. We do not want to do say anything at this stage that will complicate matters or embarrass our government, â€˜â€™ said one diplomat.

But some visiting diplomats are willing to speak off the record. Their views:

â€¢ These elections donâ€™t mean much because most of the separatist parties are unwilling to participate. They canâ€™t because they lack organisation, their cadres are in prison and they need time to convince their constituency that election is not a bad word.

â€¢ J&K elections are not the same as in other states. Its history is different as are the peopleâ€™s aspirations. The process of setting things right should have started with dialogue.

â€¢ Voter ID cards, electronic voting machines and requisitioning officers from other states are fine. But fairness is not dependent only on electoral roles alone. Separatists like the Hurriyat are not allowed to hold meetings. How can elections be fair in these circumstances?

â€¢ The limited interaction with common Kashmiris shows they are fed up with violence. If elections promise change they would be all for it. But they are not convinced.

â€¢ Militant groups want to disrupt the elections. So those participating are taking a big risk.

â€¢ Thereâ€™s enough justification for an average Kashmiri to be disillusioned.

â€¢ The government must propose an economic, political and legal package. Start confidence -building measures â€” release political prisoners, send security forces to the barracks.

â€¢ Election is important. But only if people believe in it.

16,Pranab flays govt policies,"KOLKATA: Calling the Planning Commissionâ€™s 8 per cent GDP growth projection for the Tenth Plan a bluff, former Union finance minister Pranab Mukherjee said it would hover around the 5.5 per cent instead.

Addressing the Merchants Chamber of Commerce, he said, â€œCommon sense shows that with a 4 per cent incremental capital output ratio, 32 per cent of the GDP has to be invested to achieve an 8 per cent growth. Who are they bluffing when through the entire Ninth Plan, the money pumped into the economy stood at only 24 per cent of the GDP.â€�

With a domestic savings rate of 23 per cent of the GDP, the government would have to borrow heavily to meet the 9 per cent deficit required to bridge the investment target, added Mukherjee.
