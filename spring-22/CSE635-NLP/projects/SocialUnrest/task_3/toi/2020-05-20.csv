0,"Pay, break the law, build more","NEW DELHI: In yet another election sop for Delhiites, the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) has decided to regularise illegal constructions in flats at a one-time payment of Rs 450 per square metre. The regularisation rate was finalised by a panel experts, set up by the Union urban development ministry, soon after it announced the amnesty scheme for flat owners in January. Flat-owners will need to get their illegal constructions certified for structural safety from registered architects. The architects will also be authorised to calculate the flat-owners' regularisation fee and process their applications. The BJP-led government at the Centre hopes to convert the amnesty scheme into electoral gains in the forthcoming assembly polls in Delhi. ''The scheme will benefit lakhs of flat-owners who are forced to add rooms in existing flats due to growing families. It will save residents from perennial harassment by civic agencies which often threaten to demolish unauthorised extensions. The beneficiaries of this scheme will vote for us,'' said a Union cabinet minister. DDA vice-chairman, Anil Baijal said,The amnesty scheme has been prepared so that people do not face any harassment at the hands of engineers in the building department. The scheme will be people-friendly and transparent.'' The scheme will be thrown open to the public next month, said Baijal. The scheme is aimed at regularising rooms illegally built by flat-owners in courtyards and on the roof. Those who have not carried out such additions yet will now get an opportunity to pay a price and do so. Illegal constructions above the limit of 15 per cent of floor area ratio will not come under the amnesty scheme's ambit. Owners of most of the 3.25 lakh DDA flats have already carried out illegal constructions. The scheme will allow them to regularise the constructions. The scheme has raised a storm with experts decrying it as being against the principles of planned development. However, DDA officials said the relaxed norms will not lead to any increase in the number of dwelling units and, therefore, there will be no additional load on existing civic services. ''The proposals of the committee were once struck down by the ministry as it was seen to be sending out a wrong message to those involved in illegal construction. A second committee retabled the report and the ministry gave its consent,'' said a DDA official.

1,"Police brace for power, water riots","NEW DELHI: The fuse is getting shorter. As Delhiites lose their patience over worsening water and power supply, the city police have identified over 25 ''potential trouble spots''. The flash-points which could erupt in rioting over these essential utilities include such upmarket enclaves as Vasant Kunj, Mehrauli, Defence Colony and Kailash Colony, as well as the middle-class areas of Gobindpuri, Okhla, Jamia and Ashram in south Delhi, Najafgarh, New Rajinder Nagar, Ranjit Nagar, Palam, Mukherjee Park, Nangloi, Inder Puri in west Delhi, Patparganj, Mayur Vihar, Acharaya Niketan and Kanti Nagar Extension. Expectedly lower income localities such as Seelampur, Karawal Nagar and Nand Nagri in the east also figure on the 'danger zone' map. Most of these places were without water for three full days, from May 15, and four-hour-plus power cuts are routine. The police fear that residents may reach a breaking point, and resort to violence. DCP (south), Vivek Gogia, said: ''In south Delhi, the power situation may get worse in areas like Sangam Vihar, Ambedkar Nagar, Madangir, Abul Fazal Enclave and Batla House in Jamia, Okhla, Ashram, Kailash Colony and Sunlight Colony.'' To defuse any potential eruption, the district police control room has been directed to be on the alert against any road blockages. The local police has been asked to step up liaising with resident welfare associations in these troubled areas. Gogia said beat patrolling has been intensified and residents have been provided with the telephone numbers of the district police and PCR to call at the first sign of brewing tension. DCP (southwest), Tejinder Luthra, said: ''We function as a link between the affected residents and the power distributing companies and Delhi Jal Board regularly to avert any crisis. Fortunately, both sides listen to us.'' Another senior officer said: ''Preventive steps have been planned also because assembly elections are round the corner. Political leaders may try to exploit the crisis, and instigate residents to resort to violence and earn political mileage.''

2,Experts lash out at state over BT policy,"PUNE: As against rapid strides made by Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, the Maharashtra biotech policy 2001 is suffering from poor implementation, resulting in considerable disillusionment in the scientific community. According to experts, some of who were on the Maharashtra government's task force that drafted the biotech policy 2001, the state has not only been lethargic in promoting biotech, but is also suffering from an absence of strategic planning and lack of political will to promote BT. Consequently, the state's pharma biotech park, adjoining the Pune IT Park at Hinjewadi, is yet to take full form even as it has evoked very little interest from biotech firms so far. A number of policy recommendations, such as setting up of an incubation centre for biotech entrepreneurs, business facilitation centres and a specialised infrastructure for the biotech industry, are still on paper. Only two firms — Pune-based Emcure Pharmaceuticals and Mumbai-based Shraya Biotech — have booked space in the Pune biotech park, while the prominent seed manufacturer, Mahyco, recently signed an MoU with the government for a facility at the Jalna biotech park. Asked about the slow pace of the biotech policy implementation in Maharashtra, state principal secretary (Industries) V.S. Dhumal said, We have been slow in creating the hype that is visible in Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. However, it is not correct to say that we have not done anything at all. Dhumal said that while Maharashtra's Biotech Commission, headed by eminent scientist R.A. Mashelkar, was scheduled to take a review next month, biotech parks were being established in Pune and Jalna, where firms like Emcure and Mahyco were planning major operations. A number of experts,were, however, unimpressed and said policy implementation is extremely weak as this task has been given to the Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC), an agency responsible for providing basic infrastructure such as roads, water and power at the industrial parks in the state. Bhushan Patwardhan, a member of the government's task force on biotechnology, said that since biotech was a highly technical subject, it was necessary for the government to work with industry leaders and scientists for the planning and promotion of the pharma biotech park project at Hinjewadi. Exogen Biosystems managing director Rajiv Datar, who also served on the task force, said that while the biotech park project at Hinjewadi seemed to be progressing satisfactorily, he was wary about the pace at which it was progressing. Anand Khandekar, former chairman of the biotech sub-committee of the Mahratta Chamber of Commerce Industries and Agriculture (MCCIA) said that while the MIDC was doing well in its core area, it is not the right agency to market Maharashtra as a biotech destination. He said what was missing in the biotech initiative was an organisation like the STPI (Software Technology Parks of India) at the state level, which could aggressively market the biotech park and speedily process formalities. Science and Technology Park director Rajendra Jagdale said that while the BT policy was excellent, the government had failed to implement it. There is a lot of disillusionment as we have failed to showcase Maharashtra's advantages for the biotech industry, he regretted.

3,Saffron emerges victorious in municipal by-elections,"PUNE: Baba Misal of the BJP and Vatsala Malekar of the Shiv Sena were declared elected in the by-elections held in two municipal panels on Sunday. Misal polled 5,642 votes, defeating his nearest rival, Chandrakant Ghanekar of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), who secured 1,768 votes. Congress rebel Deepak Randhir secured just 111 votes, while independent candidate Subhash Thorwe polled 30. The BJP has thus retained its hold on the Maharana Pratapsingh Udyan panel. The by-election in the ward was held as Baba Misal's elder brother and sitting corporator, Satish Misal, was murdered three months ago. Similarly, the Shiv Sena has once again retained its hold on the Rasta Peth power house panel. The by-election in the ward was held following the accidental death of the Sena's sitting corporator, Chhaya Malekar. The Sena had nominated Chhaya's mother, Vatsala Malekar, as the party's official candidate. Vatsala polled 3,432 votes to defeat independent candidate Shamim Sundke by a margin of 55 votes. Shamim Sundke, mother of former standing committee chairman and Congressman Anis Sundke, polled 3,381 votes. The ruling Congress party received a setback as its official candidate, Kaku Gavhane, was pushed to the third place owing to the rebellion by Sundke. Gavhane secured 2,204 votes. A rebellion by BJP worker Sangeeta Tiwari did not affected Malekar as Tiwari could secure only 118 votes. NCP wins Pimpri Mandai ward: Ramadhar Dharia of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) was elected from ward no. 30 C (Pimpri Mandai ward), defeating his nearest rival, Mahesh Mewani, by 456 votes in the Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) by-election. Dharia bagged 2,224, while Mewani secured 1,768. The poll had to be held again as Mohan Goswami of the NCP was disqualified, as the caste certificate submitted by him was found to be fake. Goswami was elected from the ward defeating Dharia, who had contested on a Congress ticket then. Dharia later joined the NCP.

4,Daewoo workers continue protest,"NEW DELHI: The standoff between workers and prime lenders of the now-defunct Daewoo Motor India continued for the second day on Tuesday as over 500 unionised employees sat on a dharna outside its Surajpur plant demanding re-employment and settlement of dues. Meanwhile, the Greater Noida police began investigation into Monday's clash between the workers and the bankers. ''We have lodged the FIR and are now investigating the matter. The people responsible for instigating the workers and starting the fight would be arrested soon,'' district police chief Rajiv Krishna said. Over 1,000 Daewoo workers, along with local political leaders, had on Monday attacked the court-appointed representatives of Daewoo's prime lenders, preventing them from taking physical possession of the plant's assets. Six policemen and as many employees were injured in the clash. Around 600 employees had then forcibly entered the premises and refused to come out. ''We had given them an ultimatum to walk out on their own or we would use force to evict them. They have all come out of the premises and are protesting outside the plant. The plant's possession has also been restored with the court receiver,'' Krishna added. But the Greater Noida authorities have deployed around 200 policemen at the unit to prevent the workers from sabotaging the plant. The 18 lenders to Daewoo Motor India are planning to appoint an independent agency to carry out the exercise of finding suitable buyers for the Surajpur unit.

5,Madhumita murder: Police find clinching evidence,"LUCKNOW: The police now claim to have found a 'clinching evidence' in the Madhumita murder case. Sources reveal that the assailants had dropped a hand-written chit near Madhumita's body in a hurry to flee after the murder. This piece of evidence was collected by the police and duly handed over to the CBCID officials after a mention in the inventory of seizures made from the scene of crime. It was during sustained quizzing that Deshraj — the domestic help of Madhumita, who is the only eye-witness to the killing—revealed about a chit of paper which the visitors had given to him to pass on to Madhumita when they came to visit her on May 9. Deshraj revealed that the visitor who had identified himself as Satya Prakash, wrote something on the chit. When the boy handed the piece of paper to Madhumita, she directed him to escort the visitors inside. On Deshraj's information, the police searched the room in which Madhumita was shot and finally traced the chit. It was found that the assailant who had identified himself as Satya Prakash, had mentioned the name of Madhumita on the piece of paper along with her c e l l p h o n e number. On the other hand, Madhumita's cellphone printouts suggest that calls continued to pour in till an hour and a half past midnight on the day of her murder. Three calls were received from Lakhimpur between 4 pm and 5 pm spreading over a total of 200 seconds. A call from the residential line of Amarmani Tripathi at his Maharajganj residence as mentioned in the diary of the information department was made on her cell at 18:17:31 spreading over 9 seconds. Another call from Maharajganj was made immediately thereafter from another landline.

7,Notorious gangster arrested,"PATNA: Notorious gangster Pintu Singh -- wanted in at least two dozen cases of murder, dacoity and extortion -- was arrested from Shivkunj Apartment located on Exhibition Road on Tuesday. Pintu, aslo a mukhiya, was currently engaged in a war of attrition with rival gangster Sheo Gope, currently lodged in Beur jail. He was also wanted in connection with the murder of a police officer. Police have recovered the revolver belonging to the slain officer from him. Acting on a tip-off, police raided a flat in Shivkunj Apartment and arrested Pintu.

Talking to mediapersons on the premises of Kotwali police station, Senior SP Sunil Kumar said that police had launched a special drive to nab criminals since the kidnapping of Dr Ramesh Chandra. ""We arrested Pintu during one such drive,"" he said. Pintu was residing in the apartment on a fake identity. For neighbours he was Sunil.

8,Modi blames govt for politician-criminal link,"PATNA: Leader of opposition in the state assembly Sushil Kumar Modi on Tuesday criticised the state government for its failure in taking action against ministers and MLAs allegedly providing shelter to criminals in their residences. Kidnapped persons are now kept in the residences of ministers and MLAs. If the government is really interested in checking the 'kidnapping industry' in Bihar, it must end the nexus between criminals and politicians, Modi said at a press conference organised on the premises of the BJP office here. The kidnappers of Dr Bharat Singh were arrested from the residence of RJD MLA Jakir Mian in Patna. But the police deliberately changed the place of their arrest in the police record, Modi said and added that one Indrajit Singh, allegedly involved in a number of kidnapping cases, was recently arrested from the house of RJD MLC Vishnu Deo Roy. Moreover, the government failed to take any action against LJP MLA Rama Singh whose name recently figured in the kidnapping case of Dr Umesh Singh of Hazaribag. At least on three occasions, police arrested criminals from the residence of Ezazul Haque, the minister of state for social welfare. Even notorious criminal Sultan had confessed to his relations with the minister as that of a master and a servant following his arrest. Yet the government did not bother to seek any explanation from Haque over the issue, Modi said. Modi claimed that the names of several ministers and MLAs had figured in the confessional statements made by criminals arrested by the police in the recent past. The confessional statement made by notorious criminal Sadik Sandani is a case in point. He was arrested by the police in Kishanganj. He has disclosed about his relations with building construction minister Taslimuddin and his private secretary Polo Jha in his statement made before the police, Modi said. He also accused Sarfaraj, son of the minister, of patronising criminals. To a query, Modi said: The BJP wants action against all politicians who are patronising criminals. Who has stopped the government from taking action against controversial MLAs or MPs belonging to the BJP or the Samata.

10,UN envoy calls for halt to Mideast violence,"UNITED NATIONS: UN Special Coordinator for Middle East Peace Process Terje Roed-Larsen said continuous terror on the ground is ""totally unproductive"" to Palestinian interests and called for parallel steps from both Israel and Palestine to take the road-map to peace in the region. Palestinian Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas would need to take steps to stop terrorist attacks against Israel if his cabinet is to survive for long. ""If the issue is not resolved, his (Abbas) cabinet might not be long-lived one. The heart of matter now is to start the (peace) process,"" Roed Larsen said. He, however, said even Tel Aviv has to move forward with confidence-building measures, including pulling back of troops, allowing workers into Israel and releasing prisoners, in order to bolster the legitimacy and popular support of Abbas' government for his anti-terror programme. ""These steps are painful, but, unfortunately, there is no other way. The two parties are glued together, they are mutually dependent, and they have to take mutual steps in reciprocity and in parallel,"" he told reporters. He is mildly optimistic about the roadmap, presented to both sides by the international quartet comprising the UN, US, European Union and Russia, as it ""differed fundamentally"" from the Oslo Accords and the Mitchell and Tenet plans. Those plans were solely based on security. The Road Map focuses on security, politics and economics. It is more radical than the Oslo Accords, as it defined the end-station, encompassed the Lebanese and Syrian tracks, and included an international monitoring mechanism for tracking implementation by both parties, he said.

11,Son's arrest politically motivated: Karuna,"CHENNAI: DMK president M Karunanidhi on Wednesday described as ""politically motivated"" the arrest of his son M K Azhagiri in connection with the murder of senior party leader and former minister T Kiruttinan and demanded action against the real culprits. ""I will be happy if the real culprits of the heinous crime are arrested instead of indulging in political vendetta,"" he told reporters here reacting to Azhagiri's arrest early on Wednesday in Madurai where Kiruttinan was murdered on Tuesday. Those who did not like his sons M K Stalin and Azhagiri coming together were behind the murder, Karunanidhi charged. Condemning the arrest, he said that police had attempted to ""strike two mangoes with a single stone"" by using the murder of Kiruttinan to arrest Azhagiri. Asked whether his party would demand a CBI probe into Kiruttinan's murder, he said it had not yet considered it. DMK general secretary K Anbahzagan, who was also present, said both Stalin and Azhagiri were like two eyes of the party. DMK would face the arrest of Azhagiri in court, he said. He added that the organisational polls, which had been postponed in some districts due to Kiruttinan's murder and also because of inter-party feud, would be completed before June 1.

12,Azhagiri's arrest leads to sibling rivalry in DMK,"CHENNAI: Former Tamil Nadu chief minister M Karunanidhi's son M K Azhagiri was arrested in the early hours of Wednesday on suspicion of links with the murder of a senior leader close to his brother and political rival M K Stalin. The arrest brought the sibling rivalry in the DMK party into the open with tension mounting in Madurai -- where Azhagiri was arrested -- and adjoining districts as supporters of Karunanidhi's two sons gathered in large numbers for a face-off, each blaming the other for the murder of former minister Pasumpon T Krittinan on Tuesday. Azhagiri, who has a political base in the southern districts including Madurai, was produced before a magistrate, remanded in 15 days' judicial custody and taken to the Tiruchirapally Central Jail. Reacting to the arrest, Karunanidhi admitted to reporters at his home here that his party was plagued by infighting. ""It makes me sad that Stalin and Azhagiri, my two sons, are involved in these quarrels,"" said the DMK president, who many claim is keen to see Stalin take over the party leadership from him. ""But factional feuds have plagued this party since the times of (C) Annadurai (the first DMK chief minister of Tamil Nadu),"" Karunanidhi pointed out. Giving his son a clean chit, Karunanidhi said: ""I do not believe Azhagiri is in any way involved in the killing of Krittinan"". He said this even as he was huddled with senior DMK leaders, trying to determine what to do next in resolving the party's internal crisis. After coming out of the magistrate's house in the morning, Azhagiri declared that his arrest ""was political opportunism and a case of revenge politics"". The assassinated former minister's brother had openly alleged that it was members of the Azhagiri faction in the DMK who had killed Krittinan. ""I hope you are happy now,"" he told some Azhagiri supporters. Stalin supporters also openly blamed Krittinan's death on the Azhagiri faction. Some DMK supporters are worried that the ruling AIADMK, their party's main rival, could now try to take advantage of the crisis and deepen the rift between the Stalin and Azhagiri factions. Stalin has for long been considered Karunanidhi's chosen political heir while Azhagiri was thought to be estranged. In the past two years, however, Karunanidhi's wife Dayalu Ammal has managed to bring about a reconciliation between him and Azhagiri. Krittinan, a 66-year-old former minister of highways and ports, was stabbed near his house in Madurai on Tuesday morning. The night before his death, he had been busy finalising candidates for a forthcoming in-party election in Madurai district. Krittinan had gone for a walk near his home when two unidentified knife-wielding assailants attacked him. People in his own house and his neighbours heard his cries. He was found bleeding profusely on the street and died as he was being put into a vehicle to be taken to hospital. His death has shaken the DMK to the core at a time the party is struggling to mount some sort of a challenge to the AIADMK, which won a brute majority in the assembly in the 2001 polls. The DMK is also living in fear of losing its foothold in national politics with Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which heads the ruling coalition, appearing keen to revive its ties with the AIADMK.

14,55 pc turnout in assembly by-polls,"NEW DELHI: Amid tight security, an estimated 55 per cent voters on Wednesday exercised their franchise for by-polls to four assembly constituencies spread over as many states sealing the fate of Maharashtra Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde among others. Barring a stray incident of stone-pelting in Fatehabad constituency of Haryana, which witnessed a turnout of 75 per cent, polling was peaceful for three other seats. Solapur (South) in Maharashtra, where Shinde is trying his luck to make way into the state assembly, recorded a 50 per cent turnout, Babubarhi in Bihar 55 per cent and Songadh (ST) in Gujarat 40 per cent. Shinde, who took over reins of government on January 18, is not a member of either house of the state legislature.. Dairy Development Minister Anandrao Deokate vacated the seat for Shinde to enable him to get elected to the lower house within a period of six months as per constitutional requirement. Shinde is facing Bahujan Samaj Party's advocate Sanjiv Sadaphule, Prabuddh Republican Party nominee Sunil Waghmare and independent Vishnu Kumbhar in a multi-cornered contest.

15,Rotation rules at GM crops panel,"NEW DELHI: Four chiefs in five months. If that sounds like a precarious job, it's also one that hits the limelight of controversy with each meeting. It's the job of chairperson of the genetic engineering approval committee (GEAC), a panel which is coordinated by the Union environment ministry and which clears genetically-modified (GM) crops, among other things, for commercialisation. Its new chief is ministry special secretary V K Duggal. Till the game of passing-the-parcel began, A M Gokhale chaired this committee. Due for a promotion, he moved out of the ministry in January. A new additional secretary, Meena Gupta, held fort briefly before the charge was given to a person who was, comparatively, a ministry veteran -- additional secretary Sushma Choudhary. Now, it's Duggal's turn, amid rumours that he too may soon move out on a promotion. Where does this leave GEAC's workload on deciding the fate of GM crops and creating a monitoring mechanism that is credible? Not unnaturally, perhaps, the uncertainty is slowing it down a bit.
