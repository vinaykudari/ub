5,CM increases State Govt doctors' allowance,"LUCKNOW: The Mayawati government on Friday revised the non-practising allowance (NPA) to the government doctors and teachers in medical colleges.A decision to this effect was taken at a cabinet meeting on Friday.

Under the new order, the government has decided to increase the NPA, based on salary slabs, by two-and-a-half times.

Now the current rate of Rs 600 per month has been revised to Rs 1,500 per month, Rs 800 to Rs 2,000 per month and Rs 900 to Rs 2,250 per month. Besides, the government has decided to revise existing salary slabs also. Now the Rs 3,000 salary slab has been revised to Rs 10,000 and Rs 3,700 by Rs 12,000.

The revised NPA will lead to an additional burden of Rs 45.13 crore on the state exchequer annually. After raising the NPA, the government made it clear to government doctors to discontinue private practice or face action. Health minister Raja Aridaman Singh has already announced vigilance surveillance on government doctors continuing with private practice.

Ayurvedic, Unani and homoeopathic doctors have, however, been excluded from payment of NPA as the government has decided to stick to the current policy of allowing them to do private practice. Similarly, veterinary doctors of the animal husbandry department have also been allowed to continue with their private practice.

A few BJP ministers protested over hike in court fees during the Cabinet meeting on Thursday. Objections were also raised over increasing the fees without taking the ruling partners into the confidence. However, the matter was resolved following intervention by senior ministers and the chief minister assured to look into the matter.

Meanwhile, the government decision to hike the NPA was widely hailed by the medical fraternity.

Reacting to the decision, general secretary of the UP Provincial Medical Services (UPPMS) Dr DP Mishra said that the association was thankful to the government for taking care of their long-standing demand.He told Times News Network on Friday Mishra said the demand put up by the association was for 29 per cent of the basic salary as non-practising allowance and the rate decided by the cabinet fell much short of the target as it only amounted to 16 to 17 per cent of the total salary structure. However, the decision still was welcome as the association was well aware of financial constraints of the state government, said Mishra.

The revised pay scale will benefit, apart from the medical college faculty members, 9,000 government doctors also. The latter had been demanding parity with the central pay committees recommendation as applicable in Delhi for the last six years. The committee ordered 25 per cent of the basic salary to government doctors in Delhi in 1996.

Later, during the tenure of Kalyan Singh, Bajaj committee was constituted to look into the demands of the cadre and this committee had also dittoed 25 per cent of the basic salary formula. The recommendation has been pending since November 1999.

7,VKS varsity issues incorrect marksheets,"ARA: Ever heard of a university proclaiming that it has no separate proforma to issue the marksheet of Part III examination, mentioning the marks obtained by an examinee of chemistry honours in Part I and Part II also.

Even the Bhojpur district consumer forum had found it ridiculous. The forum had ordered the Veer Kuer Singh University (VKSU) administration to pay Rs 2,000 as compensation to the complainant within two months, apart from issuing a fresh and correct marksheet of Part III, showing the marks obtained by the student in Part I and Part II examinations also.

Interestingly, the stipulated period given to the university by the consumer court has elapsed, but the VKSU administration is yet to issue correct marksheet to its alumni, leaving apart payment of compensation.

Hundreds of students, who have passed the honours examination in chemistry from various colleges under the VKSU since 1996, continue to suffer for no fault of theirs. In fact, they had to face the consequences of the mistakes committed by the VKSU administration as the marksheet of the Part III (chemistry honours) were being declared as ""fake"" and ""forged"" by other universities in and outside Bihar.

The VKSU''s marksheet of part III (chemistry honours) does not tally with the marksheets of part I and II examinations issued earlier.

Apurava Suryadeo and Anand Mohan, who had passed their B.Sc. (chemistry honours) examination from the VKSU in 2000 had applied for admission to the management courses in an institution outside Bihar. But they had to face agonising moments when the officials of the institution held them responsible for ""forging"" their marksheets which they had enclosed with their application forms.

Later, they urged the VKSU administration time and again to issue corrected marksheets. But in vain. Finally, Apurava Suryadeo lodged a case in the consumer forum here. The consumer court observed that the marks obtained by the complainant in Part I and Part II examinations were not mentioned in the Part III marksheet. Instead, wrong marks were mentioned in separate papers.

According to the VKSU syllabus of chemistry honours (three-year degree course), in the Part I, Paper I, the theory paper is divided into three parts IA, IB and IC -- each of 50 marks. Paper II is a practical paper of 50 marks. Similarly, in Part II, Paper III is theory paper divided into three parts IIIA, IIIB and IIIC -- each carrying 50 marks and paper IV is practical of 50 marks.

In Part III, Paper V, VI and VII are theory papers, each carrying 100 marks and paper VIII is practical of 100 marks. The marksheets of Part I and Part II have separate columns to show marks of paper IA, IB, IC and paper IIIA, IIIB, IIIC but it has no column of mentioning paper II and Paper IV. The marksheet of Part III (chemistry honours) has three separate columns to show the marks of Part I, Part II and Part III.

But, in the column of Part I, the marks obtained in papers IA, IB, and IC have been divided into two papers -- Ist and IInd -- each of 75 marks. Similarly, in the column of Part II, the same mistake has been repeated and paper IIIA, IIIB, IIIC of 50 marks each are shown as paper III and IV of 75 marks each.

Senior university teachers wonder: ""How the magical figures of theory marks of three separate sub-groups have been shown in two papers.""

When contacted, controller of examinations S P Srivastav said the university has adopted a new format of marksheet and those who are appearing in the current examination will get the marksheet as per the syllabus. He said that the university had not yet received any order from the consumer court.

9,Sabotage ruled out in Kamrup Express derailment,"GUWAHATI: The railways on Saturday ruled out possibility of sabotage and said intense cold condition that caused cracks on the rail track might have caused the derailment of Kamrup Express on Friday night between Tihu and Pathsala in lower Assam.

""The intense cold condition may have caused crack on the rail track which led to the derailment of 12 bogies and the engine of the Howrah-Dibrugarh express train,"" a North East Frontier railway spokesperson said here.

Ruling out any possibility of sabotage, the spokesperson, however, said the exact cause of the derailment could be ascertained only after the ongoing probe by the safety division was over.

She said the area where the mishap occurred was not accustomed to the current spell of cold and that may have led to the cracks.

This was the initial impression of the top railway officials who visited the site early today after talking to eye witnesses and examining the track, she said.

Passengers of the packed train had a miraculous escape when 12 bogies as well as the engine of the express derailed without injuring anyone.

""The fog was also a saving factor as the train was at a very slow speed when the derailment took place,"" she said.

There would have been heavy casualties had the express train was at its highest speed, she said.

The track is being cleared and traffic on the section is expected to be through by Saturday night, she said.
