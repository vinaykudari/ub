0,"BJP knocked out, Cong gains in state polls","new delhi: a day after the results of the elections in the four states came, all eyes are on mayawati whose 99 seats will be instrumental in government formation in uttar pradesh. though the bsp leader, who arrived in delhi on sunday, said she would ''think twice'' before going with the sp, she has not ruled out that option. neither has she provided any hint as to her attitude towards the bjp. samajwadi party chief mulayam singh yadav has set the ball rolling by calling for anti-bjp forces to come together. the indirect congress response was provided by sonia gandhi, who has said that she would have to consult her colleagues on the party's moves. on the other hand, the temptation for the bjp to form a government in up is strong, considering that it will not be doing so in punjab and uttaranchal. on sunday, when the verdict came out, it was a big setback for the bjp. the ruling party at the centre had suffered a humiliating defeat in the state assembly elections of uttar pradesh and uttaranchal, and its poor showing in punjab had clearly contributed to the defeat of the akali dal. the congress was the winner in two of four state assemblies that went to polls, but in the politically critical state of uttar pradesh, it remained a poor fourth. in manipur, however, the electorate might yet return a congress government. the hung verdict in up, where the sp was heading for some 150 seats, the bjp 111, bsp 99 and the congress 23, was a harbinger of turmoil and horse-trading in the days to come. the outcome of the by-elections to state assemblies and the lok sabha across the country was clearcut. aiadmk chief jayalalithaa got a 54th birthday present: a victory in the andipatti assembly by-election. in gujarat, narendra modi won the rajkot ii assembly seat, but the loss of two other seats to the congress signal difficult times ahead for the bjp in the state whose assembly goes to the poll next year. in karnataka, former prime minister h d deve gowda bested the congress in the kanakpura lok sabha bypoll. an indication of things to come was available early this month when the timespoll conducted by the drs, predicted the hung up outcome and the congress victories in punjab and uttaranchal. predictably, the bjp leaders are emphasising that the elections cannot be seen as a verdict on their government at the centre. but only the naive will believe that the outcome will not impact the national polity in the run-up to the next general elections. one reason for this is the scale of the bjp defeat. while anti-incumbency can be blamed for the loss in punjab and uttaranchal, only poor governance and political mismanagement can explain the up debacle. the pace of events now in punjab and uttaranchal is likely to be measured and uneventful. but in uttar pradesh, hectic activity began almost as soon as the trends started coming in on sunday morning. officially, all parties remain non-committal, but sp chief mulayam singh yadav has set the ball rolling by calling for anti-bjp forces to come together. the indirect congress response was provided by sonia gandhi, who has said that she would have to consult her colleagues on the party's moves. bsp leader mayawati, who reached delhi on sunday evening, has said she would ''think twice'' before going with the sp, but has not actually ruled it out categorically. neither has she provided any hint as to her attitude towards the bjp. the temptation for the bjp to form a government in up is strong, considering that it will not be doing so in punjab and uttaranchal. the arithmetic looks daunting, but up governor vishnu kant shastri, a long-time rss activist, is the joker in the pack. his declaration, even before all the results were officially declared, that rajnath singh can continue as cm till march 26, the legal life of the assembly, and that the need for 'stability' within the state, would be a major element in helping shape his decision, speaks for itself. related stories:

1,US fund prohibits investments in India,"silicon valley: americaâ€™s largest pension fund grouping has advised foreign investors in india to take into account social and human rights factors while making equity investments in the country. a new policy adopted by the california public employees retirement system (calpers) has suggested the investors to look beyond the broad financial factors such as market liquidity and volatility, and consider social and human rights criteria as well. the fund, which manages assets totalling more than $ 151 billion, does not currently invest in india. calpers spokesman brad pacheco said that on a scale of 1-3, with three being the best, india scored one in terms of settlement proficiency and capital market openness. india has fared equally low in terms of labour practices, once again scoring merely one. besides india, other emerging markets unacceptable under new calpers criteria are pakistan, china, colombia, egypt, indonesia, jordan, malaysia, morocco, the philippines, russia, sri lanka, thailand and venezuela. out of these, calpers has investments in thailand, the philippines, malaysia and indonesia. following the review, calpers announced that it will be pulling out of investments in these countries. market liquidity and volatility, market regulation and investor protections, capital market openness, settlement proficiency, and transaction costs accounted for 50 per cent of the review. political stability, financial transparency and labour standards accounted for the remaining 50 per cent, the fund said. calpersâ€™ review of the emerging markets is believed to be the first of its kind ever done by a public pension fund and the fear is that others may follow its lead in investment strategy. the markets that calpers will allow its managers to invest in are argentina, brazil, chile, czech republic, hungary, israel, mexico, peru, poland, south africa, south korea, taiwan and turkey.

3,No retirement benefits for ex-principal,"kishanganj: though he was awarded for being the â€œbest principalâ€� of the b n mandal university (bnmu), madhepura, he is yet to get all his retirement benefits two years after his retirement. he is thus facing great financial difficulties. aditya nath saha, retired principal of marwari college, kishanganj, was adjudged the best principal in bnmu and was also awarded by the then vice-chancellor r k chowdhury. but, though he has been running from pillar to post, the university bigwigs are yet to settle all his retirement benefits. and, as if to rub salt into his wounds, many teachers and principals who retired after he relinquished the office, have already been paid their retirement benefits. says saha, ""if there were any charges against me, it could perhaps be understood. however, it seems i am being penalised for being declared the best principal of my times."" the retired teachers, as well as principals, are rather sick of the dilatory and apathetic attitude of the university officials. ""after retirement, whereas we should have been allowed to sit peacefully and be smug, we have to run helter-skelter for obtaining the benefits to which we are legally entitled,"" says a retired university professor of hindi, umesh nandan sinha.

4,Industry unhappy with govt,"kolkata: the flurry of behind-the-scenes activity and work at the clc notwithstanding, industry and commerce minister nirupam sen is unfazed. â€œwe can do precious little at this stage. moving the tanneries is impossible. our lawyers will argue the case but letâ€™s see what happens,â€� sen told tnn on sunday morning before leaving for the cpm state conference. the ministerâ€™s remarks drew sharp criticism from the leather industry. â€œif either sen or chief minister buddhadeb bhattacharjee says he is helpless, he should quit. this government has not been able to create employment for 15 years. how dare they rob jobs of five lakh people dependent on the leather industry in the city,â€� a section challenged. while they concede that the industry is not a holy cow and has its share of faults, they feel that in this particular case, it is they who are being penalised for no fault of theirs. â€œthere is failure on the part of the bot party and the governmentâ€™s monitoring mechanism. yet, it is the industry which has to suffer despite paying the entire amount for land which is not yet ready,â€� they argued.

5,Is Central rule an option?,"lucknow: has the samajwadi partyâ€™s inability to notch up a majority support in the house of 403 coupled with the ruling bjpâ€™s failure to retain its hold on the masses, pushed uttar pradesh towards presidentâ€™s rule? the single largest group in the vidhan sabha, the samajwadi party has fallen short of getting majority. this obviously has brightened the prospect of the bahujan samaj party forming the next government with the support of the bjp. if the bjp shies away from offering unconditional support to the dalit outfit, its sworn enemy, the samajwadi party will get an upper hand in the government formation, a prospect not many in the bjp relish. a senior union minister from bihar told this correspondent that presidentâ€™s rule was the only option left before the nda government at the centre. but this possibilty is also beset with problems, says a senior bjp leader. after imposition of central rule, it would be obligatory on the part of the centre to get it okayed by both houses of parliament. the nda would require the help of the congress for getting it passed in the rajya sabha because the bjp does to not have enough support in the upper house to see it through. and in keeping with the past records of the congress to keep itself away from the bjp, the centre cannot hope to rush through the decision to impose presidentâ€™s rule.

6,Opposition raps govt for kowtowing to WB,"hyderabad: the opposition leaders on sunday criticised chief minister n chandrababu naiduâ€™s government for falling into what they called the vicious circle of world bank loans by accepting all conditionalities imposed by the bank. the leaders, participating at a workshop organised by the cpm state committee on â€˜world bank agreements: boon or baneâ€™ expressed concern that the state would head for a economic disaster if the government continued taking loans indiscriminately from world bank without ensuring their proper utilisation. opposition leader y s rajasekhara reddy, mim floor leader in the assembly asaduddin owaisi, cpm legislator n narasimhaiah, trs representative n narasimha reddy, besides cpm state secretary bv raghavulu, called for a united struggle by the political parties to pressurise the government to stop adopting â€œworld bank-dictated policiesâ€� in the state. speaking on the occasion, rajasekhara reddy lambasted the government for taking structural adjustment loans from the world bank and falling into the vicious circle of taking fresh loans for servicing debt incurred on the old loans. â€œthe congress is not against taking loans from external monetary agencies. but they should be obtained without conditionalities and efforts should be made to ensure that they are utilised effectively to create assets. no such measure was seen in the state in the last seven years of the tdp rule and the government is spending the amounts obtained from the world bank on productive purposes and publicity campaign, which alone runs to rs 300 crore,â€� he said. the opposition leader said that the government hiked taxes more than thrice in one year on the pretext of earning revenues to cater to its promises like power subsidy to farmers, rs 2 a kg rice and total prohibition of liquor. however, within six months of hiking taxes and collecting revenues to the tune of rs 3,000 crore, the ban on liquor was lifted while the price of power to farm sector and rice were increased. â€œthe government is only trying to live in hype while the achievements on the ground are not seen as corruption and nepotism are ruling the roost in the state. crucial issues like farmers suicides and others are being ignored by the government,â€� he added. asaduddin alleged that the world bank was deciding on the priorities of the state, while the chief minister was trying to enhance his image by misusing the loans obtained from external agencies. â€œonly one section of people is being benefited by the world bank loans and that is the tdp cadre and the contractors,â€� he said. owaisi asked the political parties to evolve a consensus on the world bank loans and the agreements signed by the government to deal with the situation. narasimha reddy said the government was only concentrating on publicity and no concrete measures were taken to utilise loans and create assets in the interests of the people. â€œchandrababu naidu will not change. it is left for us to unite cutting across political lines and change his government,â€� he said. cpm state secretary bv raghavulu, who presided over the meeting, criticised the government for blindly following the policies dictated by the world bank, which was giving scope for widespread corruption at all levels.

7,"Speed up projects, railway minister told","gandhinagar: the gujarat government wants sufficient budgetary provisions be made in the upcoming railway budget for 2002-03 to convert four railway tracks into broad gauge and construct four new railway tracks. an official memorandum submitted to the central government says that of the 14,500 km that were supposed to be converted during the eighth and ninth five year plans, only 7,744 km were taken care of. bigger provisions are, therefore, necessary for the better functioning of the state''s ports and attracting investment. the four gauge conversion projects that the state wants the ministry of railways to take up immediately are - samkhyali-palanpur, extension of the rajkot-veraval track up to somnath and kodinar, connecting gandhinagar with the ahmedabad-delhi broad gauge route, and the mehsana-viramgam track. the samkhyali-palanpur project, the note says, will help transport of goods from the ports of kandla and mundra through a much shorter route to delhi than the existing delhi-ahmedabad-kandla route. the project has been accepted in principle by the railways. a draft memorandum of understanding has been prepared by the gujarat infrastructure development board, with the ministry of railways providing 33 per cent funds, the state government 16.5 per cent, kandla port trust 30 per cent, gujarat adani port (mundra) 15 per cent and iffco 5.5 per cent. only, funds allocation by the railways is a crucial prerequisite. though the gauge conversion of the ahmedabad-gandhinagar track is ""pending since long"", the insufficient budgetary allocation of rs 4 crore in 2001-02 did not take the project beyond the centre''s proposal for land acquisition. and finally, the mehsana-viramgam track conversion, which would save time and distance for the port-generated cargo from the saurashtra region, has been pending due to lack of funds. so far, only earthwork and bridges have been taken up. the main section on the route that needs ""urgent attention"" is vadodara-surat. this apart, the four new railway tracks that needs to be constructed - dhrangadhra-kuda track, with the state ready to share the cost; connecting porbander railway station with the all-weather port jetty (8 km), necessary to take care of the cargo there; the jamnagar-bedi port to rosipier (19 km), for developing necessary infrastructure for the bedi port; and the godhra-dahod-indora and devas-maksi track, for which the fund allocation of rs 15 crore is proving to be quite insufficient.

9,Closure of AC making unit gets govt nod,"mumbai: the maharashtra government has permitted leading aircondition manufacturer voltas ltd to close down its unit at thane.the closure of the unit, which employs 161 workers, has met with opposition from the workers'' union. the government has accepted the company''s plea that its operations had become unviable due to rising input costs, losses and increased competition. the unit will now be operated from dadra nagar haveli, which offers tax benefits and cheap labour. the company has three other units manufacturing air-conditioning equipment for buildings, fork lifts and pumps. these would not be affected as of now, company sources said. the workers'' union says the move would affect 118 workers who have not accepted the voluntary retirement scheme. the government decision is in tune with the union cabinet decision on friday to relax provisions relating to closure of industrial units. management sources said the average wage in the thane establishment was rs 12,000 a month which was uneconomical for the company in the present environment. the management also had to contend with a fall in the prices of room air-conditioners from nearly rs 27,000 to rs 16,000.

11,Love-struck actress commits suicide,"hyderabad: budding film actress pratyusha died at care hospital on sunday morning. the actress and her boyfriend, sidhartha reddy, consumed poison on saturday night allegedly after their parents objected to their love affair. sidhartha is said to be in a critical condition. according to the panjagutta police, 20-year-old pratyusha and sidhartha reddy, with whom she was in love for the past three years, walked into the reception of the care hospital in banjara hills at about 8 pm on saturday and told the staff they had consumed poison and wanted treatment. the couple, who had come to the hospital in sidhartha's car, were rushed to the intensive care unit. while undergoing treatment, pratyusha suffered cardiac arrest and succumbed on sunday morning, while sidharth is battling for life. the couple had allegedly consumed poison while driving around banjara hills road 12. the police said they suspect that once the poison started taking its effect, the couple panicked and rushed to the hospital. pratyusha was last seen by her mother when she went out saying she was called by director teja to discuss a movie role, sources said. police suspect that pratyusha, who was a resident of premsagar apartments in tarnaka, met sidhartha somewhere and attempted to end life in the car. pratyusha, who has acted in five telugu and 12 tamil films apart from a number of tv serials, was a final year hotel management student. she had been seeing sidhartha reddy, 22, a fourth year student of vasavi engineering college, for the past three years. the couple had resorted to ending their lives after their parents asked them to stop meeting. pratyusha's body was shifted to the osmania general hospital on sunday for post-mortem. the panjagutta police have registered a case of death under suspicious circumstances, police said. pratyusha's first film was kaddal pookal (1990) directed by bharathi raja. noted film and tv artistes such as avs, kiran kumar and shivaji came to the hospital to console the bereaved family.

12,NRIs want simpler investment procedures,"ahmedabad: indians abroad are eagerly awaiting yashwant sinha''s february-28 budget speech, which may help to solve their dilemma of whether to invest in home country or not. the nris, one of the most powerful channels of bringing in foreign investment, expect incentives from the budget and also a solution to the maze of formalities that they have to go through to invest in their homeland. with, a demand to simplify and shorten the business agreement procedures, they expect the government to redefine the nri status and introduce measures that would enable them to easily invest back home. ""taking prior approval from the foreign investment promotion board and the reserve bank of india, takes more than two months for foreign companies to invest in india,"" vishnu varshney, president of indo-american chamber of commerce says. and with this long bureaucratic procedures, there are slow reforms dissuading potential nri investors. the investment procedure needs to be streamlined. according to varshney, there should be an automatic route to quicken the secondary market operations. ""more than 50 per cent of the foreign direct investment gets diverted to other southeast asian countries due to long bureaucratic procedures here,"" he adds. ""it does not take more than a week for a foreign company to invest in developing southeast asian countries like malaysia or korea,"" agrees anant ghosalia, director of a french manufacturing company. to compete with these developing countries, india needs to rework on its tax and custom duties structure. ""there are impediments like tax on technology transfer and marketing tools like material of promotion, which the government needs to abolish,"" he says. ""opening up the small scale industry sector (ssi) for nri investment, if not foreign investment, would work as a major incentive for small indian investors abroad,"" says babu ramlingam, a consultant from singapore. in china, 40 per cent of the foreign direct investment (fdi) falls into ssi, and more than 80 per cent of the chinese staying in foreign countries invest back in china, he explains. ""if the nris can invest only in manufacturing, than it would fail to attract the volume of investment needed in service sector which includes investing in hotels or any service firms,"" he adds. ""it is high time to focus on reforms in fdi,"" says krishnakant vakharia, president of vishwa gujarati samaj. the first generation nris invest in india due to their emotional ties and not because it has secure and attractive investment options and policies. markets in europe and us are steady and offer safe investment options. and with this, today only two per cent of the young indians abroad and the second generation nris invest back in india. ""and if, the government fails to consider the nri demands, it will be like neglecting a major source of foreign investment,"" says vakharia. ""many nris also want to invest in social improvement in india,"" says meenal pandya, a boston-based financial services consultant. ""however, due to lack of transparency and legal assurance for implementation of plans, a majority of them step back."" the budget may not include popular tariff cuts and duty exemptions, however, what is mainly expected by nris is, that it should maintain consistency in tax and custom duties structure al least for five years. a budget changing the tax structure ever year affects all business and investment equations making it unviable for the nris to invest in an option, which will maintain their dollars'' value steadily.

13,More farmers make it to Tobacco Board,"guntur: farmers in the tobacco board finally succeeded in sidelining tradersâ€™ lobby in the elections to the sub-committees. apart from capturing the prestigious vice-chairman post, farmersâ€™ representatives prevented the entry of â€˜hard nutsâ€™ into important committees. the members of the reconstituted board met in guntur recently to approve the budget for the next financial year besides electing vice-chairman and sub-committees. sources in the tobacco board told the times of india that five sub-committees were formed to look into the functions of the board at the meeting. while board chairman dr dayachari would chair the executive, production and marketing committees, director k j b v subramanyam will chair the other two sub-committees which were formed to take care of registration of growers and traders. an important outcome of the committees election was that no trader was elected as member to the most important production committee. this committee would play a key role while fixing the crop size. trade representatives have tried their best to enter the committee by supporting mp y v rao, who is also a trader. but, members of the farmers opted another mp karanam balaram to prevent the entry of y v rao. it may be recalled that cherukuri ramanaiah naidu, farmersâ€™ representative from nellore district, was elected to the prestigious vice-chairman post against the wishes of trade representatives in the board. the members of the committees are: executive committee: dayachari (chairman), ramanaiah naidu, k j b v subramanyam, y v rao, chowdaiah, m bangarubabu, d purnachandra rao, bellam kotaiah. production committee: dayachari (chairman), ramanaiah, subramanyam, karanam balaram, k r kishore (secretary, agriculture, ap government), chunduri ranga rao, y t mahesh. marketing committee: dayachari (chairman), subramanyam, ramanaiah, balaram, bellam kotaiah, maddi venkateswar rao, m k manda, v v rao. registration committee (growers): subramanyam (chairman), v v rao, bangaru babu, chowdaiah, d purnachandra rao. registration committee (traders) is headed by subramanyam.

14,Minister rules out field trials of dreaded Bt cotton variety,"vijayawada: agriculture minister vadde sobhanadreeswara rao has asserted that there was no question of allowing field trials of the dreaded terminator seeds in the state as also that of the bt cotton variety. addressing the pencounter programme organised by the bezawada press club in vijayawada on sunday, minister said the agreement signed with the us monsanto company was restricted to research in bio-technology and genetic engineering at the proposed bio-technology park of the icici. â€œwe are committed to protect the interests of the farmers by all means. we cannot allow the use of bt cotton seed unless the central government permits it,â€� minister said. the bt cotton seed was still in an experimental stage and no commercial use of the seed would be permitted, he added. replying to a question, agriculture minister said the state government had approached nabard for a rs 30 crore financial assistance to take up the tarakarama lift irrigation scheme in his mylavaram constituency since the government did not had requisite funds. a response from nabard in this regard was awaited. referring to the pulichintala project, minister said the government was considering the objections being raised by farmers of nalgonda district. only after their views were heard, the government would go ahead with the project, he added. on the central governmentâ€™s decision to close down food corporation of india, minister said chief minister n chandrababu naidu has already communicated his demand to the centre that it should be continued in the interest of farmers. the agriculture minister attributed farmersâ€™ suicides in various parts of the state to not only to crop losses but also due to other factors like family problems, debt-burden. since farmers were unable to get adequate finance from banks and other institutions they were forced to borrow from private persons.

15,"Modi wins, but party loses in Gujarat","ahmedabad: chief minister narendra modi triumphed by a respectable margin of 14,728 votes in the high-profile rajkot-2 constituency, but it was the congress which shared the honours by scoring convincing wins in the other two seats - mahua and sayajigunj - which it wrested from the bjp. the icing on the cake was of course taken away by the bjp which won the crucial rajkot constituency, albeit with half the margin of what was secured by former finance minister vajubhai vala who vacated the seat to pave the entry of modi into the assembly. while the congress had nurtured hopes of a close finish in rajkot after a bitter campaign, the vote in rajkot clearly went for the chief minister. celebrations broke out in the bjp camp in rajkot and ahmedabad as a victory procession was taken out for modi even as the congress made a major dent in south and central gujarat. modi polled 45,297 votes (57.32 per cent), while ashwin mehta of the congress got 30,569 votes (38.68 per cent). though the victory margin was not very flattering, it is significant considering the small size of the electorate and the fact that modi polled nearly 15 per cent more votes than his nearest congress rival. the results left many congress leaders, who were hoping to pull off the biggest political upset in recent times, and many blamed the vicious pamphleteering against modi towards the end of the campaign which alienated many upper-caste and middle-class voters who felt the personalised attack was in bad taste. there were others in the congress who believed that but for the late blitzkrieg against the chief minister, the congress stood no chance against a candidate who had the might of the administration and the weight of his position behind him. but the bjp''s preoccupation with rajkot seems to have cost it dearly as it lost both the other constituencies. in vadodara, jaspal singh''s calculations, when he quit the bjp and forced a by-election in sayajigunj, seem to have gone awfully wrong as he had to suffer the humiliation of losing his deposit with just 6980 votes (4.59 per cent). the victory went to dalsukh prajapati of the congress and that too with a resounding margin of 22,554 votes. what should be more worrying for the bjp is the gap of almost 15 per cent between the votes that prajapati and its candidate, jitu sukhadia, got. this, despite the fact that candidates of the samajwadi party (jaspal) and nationalist congress party (jatin modi) nibbled away a sizeable chunk from the congress vote bank. some bjp leaders are surprisingly taking satisfaction in the fact that jaspal lost his deposit and that was good enough for them. and while the bjp had given up on sayajiganj midway through the campaign, there was more good news for the congress from the south where it won the mahua seat by a comfortable margin of 12,695 votes. both the sayajiganj and the mahua victories are being interpreted as signs of the continuing upsurge in the fortunes of the congress which had also won the by-elections to the sabarmati and sabarkantha seats late last year forcing the bjp to dump keshubhai patel and opt for a younger leader in modi.

17,Parties draw strategies following UP polls,"new delhi: rival parties swung into strategy sessions to forge possible poll alignments for government formation in uttar pradesh which again threw up a hung assembly after samajwadi party emerged as the single largest party with all but one of the 403 results declared in the state. with none of the parties having a clear majority to cross the magic mark of 202, the samajwadi party, bjp, bsp and the congress were keeping their cards close to their chest as political activities following a fractured verdict in the crucial state shifted to the capital here. of the 402 seats declared so far, samajwadi got 146, a gain of 34 seats while bjp came second losing 52 seats to notch a tally of 108. the bsp was in third position putting up an impressive show to bag 99 seats, gaining 33 seats in the process. congress bagged 26 seats. independents and others who could hold the key to the formation of a new government secured 23 seats. counting has been stopped in one seat in hoonda from where sports minister raghuraj pratap singh alias raju bhayya,who has a criminal background, is one of the contestants. the bjp leadership has convened a meeting on monday to review the poll results while the national democratic alliance (nda) will also hold deliberations to take stock of the situation. the focus was also on up governor vishnu kant shastri on his line of action in formation of the next government. he has said that he would be guided by the ability of any party to provide a stable government more than calling the single largest party to have a go in government formation. chief minister rajnath singh, who resigned following the drubbing the bjp received at the hustings, made it clear today that his party is not going to stake any claim to form the government since the people had given their mandate for the bjp to sit in the opposition singh and other leaders like kalraj mishra said it was early to suggest if bjp and bsp could come together to form the next government amid apparent differences within the bjp on extending support to bsp supremo mayawati. congress''s strategy appears to be to keep the bjp out of office with spokesman s jaipal reddy saying after the congress working committee (cwc) meeting last night that the congress ""will not allow any communal forces or any party which is pro-bjp to come to office"".

27,GU again delays law results,"ahmedabad: thousands of law students are biting their nails with the gujarat university delaying ballb results by more than a couple of weeks yet again. university''s controller of exams satish bhatt said they would declare the results soon but refused to give the exact date. the students say they are all set to give their final exams on april 23 and having the results of their previous exam in hand would have helped. ""the exam was held in november,"" one of the students said. ""it''s been nearly four months since these exams were conducted. surely, there must be a way of ensuring that the authorities announce the results by this time,"" the student said. bhatt, however, says there are many technical hazards that lead to the delays. ""for starters, there are three separate syllabuses - the two old ones and one new one,"" he says. ""we have to co-ordinate for all three of them and at times it takes time. add to this the fact that we don''t always find assessors. the checking has to be done by lawyers and not all of them have the time and the inclination to work for the exam process,"" he adds. the authorities have to invariably send many of the answer sheets to other universities to complete the process taking even more time. in the past, there have also been instances of authorities losing answer sheets while transporting them from one centre to another. college authorities say the delays make a mockery of the semester system that the bar council of india has insisted on in all law colleges. if the results are not declared on time, then the entire schedule of the college falls out of gear. they don''t know what to do with the students who are likely to fail in the previous exam and still be allowed to sit for the next semester. also students not happy with their marks will demand that their papers be rechecked. all these processes will be delayed, they say.
