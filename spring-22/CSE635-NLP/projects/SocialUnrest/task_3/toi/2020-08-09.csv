0,Strike will turn govt employees into 'bonded labourers',"KOCHI: Eminent trade union leader and General Secretary of the Hind Mazdur Sabha (HMS), U M Purohit, on Saturday said that taking away the right of the government employees to strike work would virtually make them ''bonded labourers''.

The Supreme Court judgement, banning strikes by government employees, would force the employees to become ''bonded labourers'', which is prohibited in India, Purohit told a meet-the-press programme here.

This judgement is ''shocking'' and all trade unions should take ''serious'' note of the same, he said.

There are 34 lakh employees in the central government,which include 16 lakh from Railways, six lakh in defence and three lakh in the telecom sector.

All these employees have been classified as Industrial Workers and are governed by the Industrial Disputes (ID) Act.

Stating that the ID Act had laid down the procedure for strike calls, he demanded to know why procedures had been laid down in law if there was no right for employees to strike.

Purohit said ''collective bargaining'' was accepted the world over. The International Labour Organiastion also recognises freedom of association and collective bargaining, he said.

The issue will be taken up at the next Indian Labour conference scheduled from August 25 to September 15.

All the central trade unions planned to file a petition, seeking review of the Apex Court judgement, he said.

1,UP gives boost to contract farming,"LUCKNOW: Contract farming is now an in thing in UP where the government has already clinched a success in roping in some corporate houses, including multinationals, for this purpose.

Being introduced first time in the state, the scheme only fits in the BJP''s plan to widen its support base among farmers, for whom the Centre has already announced many sops, including easy agriculture loans.

Borrowed from Punjab, Haryana and Andhra Pradesh, the idea is now put in action here.

The area earmarked for contract farming this year is around 4.5 lakh hectare for cultivation of Pusha-1 variety of Basmati and another two lakh hectare for wheat.

These commodities are in great demand and have tremendous export potential. The whole emphasis is on quality. And how to achieve this? Agriculture minister Hukum Singh explains: ""The necessary input, including seed, fertiliser and technical know-how will be provided to farmers for this purpose by the party signing contract with them.""

While western UP, stretching from Saharanpur to Meerut, is found ideal for Basmati cultivation, part of central UP spreading over Shahjehanpur to Unnao, Kanpur, Auraiya and Etawah is found suitable for wheat cultivation.

The agreement for contract farming with farmers in these areas have already been made for this year by different companies, including an American one.

Incidentally, these are the areas associated with different lobbies of farmers being assiduously cultivated by different political parties. And, going by political influence, Mulayam Singh Yadav of the Samajwadi Party is to central UP what Ajit Singh of the Rashtriya Lok Dal is to western UP. And, with this new scheme, the BJP hopes to get its pound of flesh, admits Hukum Singh, a senior BJP minister.

The minister explains: ""The contract farming is an answer to the failure of the cooperative system in UP."" The twin objective of the scheme is to boost agriculture export and improve farmers'' welfare by providing them assured marketing support.

To begin with, the minister said, only paddy and wheat had been selected for contract farming and, gradually, its scope would be widened by bringing sugarcane and horticulture also in its ambit. A roadmap, he said, was already being prepared for this purpose and the government would act on it only on the basis of the success of its first phase experiment.

Under the scheme, farmers will sell their produce directly to their ''contractors''. The purchase centres set up by them will be deemed as mandis and, as such, they will be exempted from the necessary condition of buying farmers'' produce through regular mandis. The government, according to the minister, will have no role, except that of a facilitator.

The price will be determined normally by market forces without any government interference. But, in case there was a distress sale due to any unforeseen reason, the minister said, the government would resort to market intervention measure in order to safeguard farmers'' interest.

2,An evil design to defame govt: CM,"PATNA: Chief minister Rabri Devi has termed the increase in crime as an â€˜evil designâ€™ to defame her government.

Speaking to journalists at her residence on Saturday, the chief minister said that her government will deal firmly with such vicious and motivated criminal activities. â€œThere is a deliberate attempt to tarnish the image of the government and Bihar. The government will not tolerate these destructive elements engaged in sullying the image of state,â€� she said.

The chief minister claimed that most of the kidnappings occurred due to internal family feud and under a conspiracy. â€œEfforts are made to cause law and order problems in the pretext of these kidnappings,â€� she stressed. She expressed unhappiness over kidnappings being projected as a law and order problem in the state and thanked the police for the quick recovery of Shwetangi.

She claimed that her government has taken â€˜foolproof measuresâ€™ to check cases of abduction and killings. She alleged that Shwetangiâ€™s relatives, including her stepmother were involved in the kidnapping and 12 persons have been taken to custody.

3,Para incident triggers trouble in SMC,"LUCKNOW: The State Minorities Commission (SMC) appears to be all set for a tug-of-war over the issue of inquiry related to violence at Para Road.

Charges and counter charges between SMC chairman Ashish Massey and member Renuka Deen over the inquiry instituted into the violence is threatening to snowball into a major controversy as each side has taken to mud-slinging, with the latter even fearing a physical assault at the behest of the former.

On Saturday, Ashish Massey told a few journalists that Renuka Deen was responsible for making public the Para inquiry report. The series of allegations levelled by him also included her failure to attend to office chores and being lax on inquiry into a case reported from Dehradun.

Reacting sharply to the reported comments of the chairman, Renuka Deen challenged Massey to prove that the inquiry was said to be confidential.

""All such inquiries are conducted in the presence of both the parties involved in the dispute along with the district administration officials and the police ... there is no question of the inquiry to be confidential,"" she clarified while talking to TNN.

Regarding the reported comment of Massey on her incompetence towards office work, Deen accused the chairman of harassment and said that Massey had even got her telephone line disconnected. ""When a person like me does not even mind using my personal mobile phone for commission work and ensure that the work does not suffer in any manner, I don''t know how anyone can call me incompetent,"" Deen retorted.

Regarding the issue related to YMCA and Assembly of Gods Church at Dehradun, on which Massey alleged that Deen had been entrusted with the inquiry but was yet to file the report, Deen revealed that she had already got the dispute resolved and both the parties had given a written undertaking on their official letter heads that they were happy with the amicable solution suggested by her.

""Even Uttranchal chief minister ND Tewari gave me a bouquet and thanked me for taking the pains of travelling all the way to Dehradun to resolve the issue which, in fact, I was more than happy to do,"" she said.

Emphatically countering the statement of Massey that the Para incident was not a minority community issue, Deen said ""as a matter of principle the commission first verifies the caste certificate of an individual before going ahead with an inquiry"".

She added that the SMC chairman had entrusted her with the inquiry and, hence, it was his duty to first verify if it was a minority issue or not.

5,Naidu scents Lok Sabha elections in February,"HYDERABAD: The Lok Sabha elections are likely to be held next February, chief minister and TDP president Chandrababu Naidu told senior party colleagues on Saturday.

The chief minister informed the TDP state executive and politburo during a closed-door meeting at NTR Trust Bhavan that he had credible information from sources within the BJP about Parliament elections being advanced by at least six months. Naidu said TDP would sail along with the BJP to victory in the elections.

Referring to the position of the party vis-a-vis the Assembly elections, the chief minister said the party is in a position to win at least 100 seats comfortably. For this, the party may have to change candidates in about 100 constituencies in order to ensure a thumping victory, sources added.

The TDP president asked party leaders to set their â€˜house in orderâ€™ and to quell dissidence at all levels. He expressed satisfaction over the successful conduct of the Godavari Pushkarams. The government received very few complaints from pilgrims about arrangements made at various Pushkaram venues in different districts, he said.

The chief minister said that he would address the party cadre over Teja TV on August 11. He said that all the members in the 5,700 villages where there was no reception of the programme should come to the mandal headquarters. He wanted their leaders to ensure that they watch the programme.

Later, at a meeting with party secretaries, the chief minister emphasised the role of secretaries and said that they hold a more important role in party growth than the district in-charges.

6,Tamilian challenges US Patriot Act,"SILICON VALLEY: A Tamil-American physician and Center for Constitutional Rights have filed a lawsuit against the US Patriot Act, the anti-terrorism law that was enacted just weeks after the September 11 terrorist attacks.

The lawsuit, filed in a Los Angeles Court on August 5, challenges a section of the law that criminalises the provision of ""expert advice and assistance"" to proscribed organisations. The Patriot Act is being widely criticised for infringing on civil liberties.

""In its rush to pass the Patriot Act just six weeks after the September 11 attacks, Congress overlooked one of our most fundamental rights {the right to express our political beliefs), especially those that are controversial,"" says CCR senior attorney Nancy Chang. ""Now it is up to the judiciary to correct Congress'' excesses.""

CCR''s motion was filed in a pending lawsuit, Humanitarian Law Project. It challenges a Patriot Act amendment to the Anti-terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, a law that makes it a crime to provide material support to any group designated by the Secretary of State as a foreign terrorist organisation.

The law, rarely enforced before September 11, has become the lynchpin of the Justice Department''s domestic criminal war on terrorism - virtually every anti-terrorism prosecution filed since September 11 has included a charge under this statute.

The Patriot Act amends the definition of material support to include ""expert advice and assistance,"" and makes it a crime to provide such advice or assistance no matter what its intent and purpose, and even where it has nothing whatsoever to do with furthering terrorism.

In March 2000, a US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit Court barred enforcement of criminal bans on providing ""personnel"" and ""training"" to proscribed groups, finding that these prohibitions are unconstitutionally vague and could criminalise a wide range of First Amendment-protected speech, from writing an op-ed to lobbying or teaching human rights advocacy. In October 2001, the district court made that injunction permanent.

In its filing earlier this week, CCR argued that the ban on ""expert advice and assistance"" added by the Patriot Act covered essentially the same activities as, and was as unconstitutionally vague as, the ban on ""training"" and ""personnel,"" and should also be struck down.

It said that plaintiff, Dr Jeyalangim, was a Ail-American physician who was deeply concerned for the welfare of the Tamils in Sri Lanka as members of his family were forced to flee that country as refugees.

He would like to alleviate the shortage of trained physicians in the Ail Eelam region of northeast Sri Lanka by providing his medical services.

However, because some of the hospitals in the region are run by the LTTE, Jeyalangim is afraid to do so because he fears prosecution for providing material support.

9,Debt-ridden trader commits suicide,"LUCKNOW: Following the closure of an oil mill, a trader, unable to clear his debt, jumped from the seventh floor of a building.

48-year-old Dhanadya Tulasyan, a resident of the Prem Vatika Nagar in Swarup Nagar area, had established an agro oil mill in the Chaudagra Fatehpur two years back. Though initially business was good, the mill started to register losses. Unable to bear it, Tulasyan took a Rs 54.6 lakh loan from the Bank of India and invested the amount in his mill, but because of losses, was unable to pay back even the interest of the loan.

Meanwhile, the trader also borrowed money from his relatives, but after continuing losses, he had to close down the mill. While his son Ashish took up a job in a readymade garments factory owned by a relative, the condition of Tulasyan deteriorated.

On August 6, Tulasyan was served a notice stating that if was unable to pay back the loan within a week, all his property including his house and the mill would be attached.

On Saturday, while his son had gone out and the other family members were sleeping, Tulasyan jumped out of the apartment situated on the seventh floor and died on the spot.

The body of the trader was sent for post mortem.

11,Govt in tight corner over incomplete SSA project,"KOLKATA: The Centrally funded education project, Sarva Siksha Abhiyan (SSA), is limping in West Bengal, because of lack of will. Contrary to government propaganda, funds have never been a problem.

The state education department is in a tight spot, for while a large corpus lies un-utilized, the government finds it difficult to complete the job of enrolling 3.1 million children out of schools by December 2003.

Started in 2000, the programme outlined that all the children in school going age will have to be enrolled by 2003 and they will be provided education upto class 8.

In desperate move, the education department has decided to keep open admissions in state run schools throughout the year. For, after the close of the normal academic admissions, the official shortfall was found to be about 3.1 million.

Now, a child can be admitted to a government-run school anytime of the year. ""By September, we hope to see a surge in the admissions due to this decisions,"" says school education minister Kanti Biswas.

The West Bengal Board of Secondary Education, too, has decided to make their rules flexible about admissions.

""The board had a lot of restrictions about admissions after the academic session. Now, that restrictions have been made flexible and the schools can inform the board later with all the admissions"" says a departmental official.

Still, the authorities are not hopeful. ""It is not possible to achieve this target through normal schools. New formal schools cannot be opened up in a hurry. We can only hope that non-formal schools and other alternatives like Rabindra Mukta Vidyalaya will be able to complete the job,"" Principal Secretary, Primary Education, T K Bose, says.

""Already, Rs 154 crore under the District Primary Education Programme (DPEP) is lying unutilised,"" he said, adding, ""we do not want funds under SSA to remain unutilised like this.""

SSA was a continuation of DPEP and the Centre had asked the state government to transfer unspent funds under DPEP to SSA.

Officials claimed that stress will have to be on alternative schooling. ""We are really upset why we were not considered a part of the project as we could have developed different models and helped the state to schieve the target,"" said RMV president, Ranjugopal Mukhopadhyay.
