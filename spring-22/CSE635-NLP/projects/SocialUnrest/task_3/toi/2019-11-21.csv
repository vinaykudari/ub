1,UP Board rules go to waste as affiliations rise,"LUCKNOW: Despite the strict rules of the UP Board to scan the credentials of the schools before granting them affiliation, there has been an increase in the number of high-school and intermediate colleges in Lucknow district, which have procured affiliation without fulfilling the minimum prerequisites.

While in 2001-2002, the number of schools/colleges â€”students of which have appeared in the board examinations â€” were 370, in the 2002-2003 session, the number increased to 466.

There has also been a rise in the number of students in the district, who areappearing for the high school and intermediate UP Board examinations. Last year, the number of such students was 77,000 while this year, around 83,519 students are enrolled to appear in these examinations. Out of this, there are 47,310 boys and 36,209 girls. The number of examination centres last year was 119 and this year they are 127. Clearly, while the number of examinees has increased by 6,519, the number of examination centres has increased by only eight.

Significantly, as per the rules, every college should have enough space and facilities to accommodate examinees. However, with the given the ratio, it is most unlikely that the said conditions would be fulfilled. When asked about the large number of affiliations, secondary education officials said that these were schools/colleges which were granted affiliation last academic year, as this year, after imposing the strict rules, only a few schools were affiliated. They said that if anybody has any objection against these schools, which have been made examination centres for this session, he/she may lodge it by November 25.

A Total of nine schools, which were made examination centres last year, do not figure in the list of centres declared by the UP Board as centres on Wednesday. While one school has voluntarily opted itself out, six colleges have not been included in the final list because as per the new rules, they failed to enrol their students for the board examination for the last three consecutive years. One inter-college was debarred due to complaints.

2,Mumbai varsity to reconsider govt demand for land,"MUMBAI: Under pressure from the state government, Mumbai university has decided to reconsider the stateâ€™s demand to give up 700 acres of land in its Kalina campus for constructing a road that will mainly benefit a high-profile hotel chain.

In April this year, the universityâ€™s management council rejected the governmentâ€™s request to hand over the land. The state government has, however, been flooding the university with letters and requests, asking it to review its decision. The university will now look at the demand at its next management council on November 25, vice-chancellor B.L. Mungekar said.

The university move has angered council members, who are upset that they are being asked to â€œreviewâ€™â€™ their unanimous decision taken in April. The management council had then categorically stated that university land should be used only for educational purposes. The council did not find any educational purpose in handing over the land for constructing a road, the main beneficiary of which would be Grand Hyatt hotel.

The governmentâ€™s industry and revenue departments have been shooting off missives to the university on the hotelâ€™s behalf, pointing out that Hyatt is a huge foreign direct investor in the state. The hotel project itself will bring in around Rs 620-crore investment, the departments have said time and again. University officials said Hyatt has been asking them to give up the land for over the last two years. Soon after, industries secretary V.S Dhumal and the revenue department pleaded Hyattâ€™s case with the university. In August, revenue minister Ashok Chavan called a meeting of university and hotel officials in a bid to convince the university to hand over its land.

Government officials are now saying that the land will benefit other industries that are coming up in the area and not just Hyatt.Mr Chavan also told university officials that the road had in any case been proposed in the municipal corporationâ€™s Development Plan. The university seems to have buckled under all the pressure, management council members said. â€œI am surprised that we are being asked to review our decision,â€™â€™ a management council member who requested anonymity said. Added another member, â€œWe had carefully considered the matter earlier and then said no to it.â€™â€™

The revenue ministry is said to have brought up â€œsix new pointsâ€™â€™ to the notice of university officials, which the management council has to consider now. One of these is that the university had earlier given up land for public purposes such as setting up an electric sub-station.

The revenue ministry has also taken pains to point out that university land worth lakhs of rupees has in any case been encroached upon. In a letter the ministry sent on September 2, it has said that the university neglected to check the illegal structures that have cropped up in its campus. Incidentally, one reason why university officials rejected the government demand earlier was because the road would have bifurcated the campus, creating a possibility of more encroachments.

Management council members, meanwhile, said the revenue ministerâ€™s points had already been discussed at its earlier meetings.

3,Dy CM rules out any role in Navi Mumbai mayoral poll,"MUMBAI: Deputy chief minister Chhagan Bhujbal has denied allegations that he helped Congress candidate Anil Kaushik for the mayorship of Navi Mumbai. He also denied that he was pulled up by Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) president Sharad Pawar.

Interestingly, NCP candidate Sanjay Naik, son of former minister Ganesh Naik, won the election as some Congress corportors had indulged in cross-voting. Mr Bhujbal termed the reports appearing in a section of the press as â€œkite flyingâ€™â€™ and ruled out any involvement in Navi Mumbai corporation election. â€œI was called by Sharad Pawar in Delhi on Monday. I met him to discuss arrangements for the Gujarat elections as the NCP will be fielding a few candidates. There was no reason for us to refer to Navi Mumbai election where our candidate won the battle,â€™â€™ he said. Mr Bhujbal said he was out of the country for ten days and was not in the city when the elections took place.

Meanwhile, MPCC president Govindrao Adik has ordered a probe at the organisational level to find out who were indulged in cross-voting. The Congress had 37 votes, five surplus than the required 32 votes to win the mayoral election. However, the partyâ€™s candidate got only 21 votes mainly due to cross-voting allegedly induced by money. Insiders claim that more than Rs 2 crore changed hands during the election. Mr Bhujbal has become target of disgruntled elements within the NCP since Mr Kaushik was close to him despite his affiliation to the Congress. Insiders claim that despite intervention of Mr Ganesh Naik, Mr Kaushik used to have an upper hand in local appointments of government officials in Navi Mumbai. NCP workers from Navi Mumbai had complained to Mr Pawar about the domination of Congress workers in Navi Mumbai and warned him that the party would suffer in the mayoral election if the Congress was not checked in time.

The mayoral election in Navi Mumbai was a matter of prestige and survival for Mr Ganesh Naik who had lost the last assembly election.He allegedly engineered defections to ensure victory for his son. Incidentally, relations between Mr Ganesh Naik and Mr Bhujbal, both former Shiv Sainiks, have been strained. Mr Ganesh Naik felt that he did not receive adequate support for his sonâ€™s election to the mayorâ€™s post.

4,Hoardings turn dartboard of political anger,"MUMBAI: The young man in the giant HDFC mutual fund hoarding stood overlooking the sluggish afternoon Pedder Road traffic, sublime financial freedom advertised on his face.He looked untouched by worries a few hundred feet below, until the first polythene bag of black paint exploded on his white T-shirt.

A volley of paint-bags followed, and soon a handful of people who had climbed the scaffolding were ripping the canvass with scissors and knives and smashing tubes of the back-lit hoarding with a childâ€™s enthusiasm.

On Wednesday, Samajwadi Party activists decided to advertise their anger and concern for the damage caused to the cityâ€™s environment by billboards and hoardings, marking out a couple of allegedly offending ones at Marine Drive and Pedder Road and leaving them torn, smashed and blackened.

The action started around 1 p.m. About 60 to 70 activists, led by president of the partyâ€™s youth wing Nassir Jamal, stormed the place under a huge Ericsson mobile hoarding shouting â€˜halla bolâ€™ and carrying banners that said, â€˜Hoarding hathao, parivahan bachaoâ€™ (remove hoardings, save the environment). Mr Jamal cited press reports that four trees had been chopped to allow for a better view of the billboard. He blamed the BMC for not taking action against erring hoarding owners. Among those who braved the heights and went up the scaffolding were Asif Iqbal Siddiqui, Trombay taluka president of Samajwadi Yuvjan Sabha, and Sheikh Mohammed Sadley, the taluka secretary. Both admitted they did not have training to climb tall places, but were doing it â€œjust for the partyâ€™â€™. The contingent then moved to Kemps Corner, swooped on the HDFC hoarding and shredded it.

They had the approval of some citizens. â€œI am against cutting trees and putting up hoardings in their place,â€™â€™ said Deepika Joshi, a Pedder Road resident.

Local units of the party will now follow up the anti-hoarding campaign at places like Kurla and Mankhurd. This is the first time the Samajwadi Party has embarked on a high-visibility campaign over a citycentric issue. State party chief Abu Aseem Azmi said the party felt responsible about protestingagainst the felling and the cutting of trees to accommodate business interests. Party insiders say that with the party growing in the state, it is looking at broad-basing its appeal and win over educated citizens, who are usually more responsive about such issues. However, hoarding owners are not impressed. On Wednesday, the owner of the HDFC hoarding filed a complaint at the Charni Road police station.

â€œWe would not blame a particular political party for it. But this fight against hoardings is part of a bigger game,â€™â€™ says a bitter A.V. Gopalakrishnan, director of the Mumbai Hoarding Owners Association. â€œSome people want to prosper at the cost of the hoarding media, and are lobbying hard to get their way.â€™â€™ He says hoardings are an essential feature of every big city in the world and vinyl signs are beautiful. â€œThe municipal corporation is planting trees in front of hoardings that have existed for 20-25 years and then crying foul. And why single out hoarding owners? Trees are being felled by the BEST, builders and in some cases the BMC itself,â€™â€™ he claimed.

He says Mumbai without hoardings is an elitist dream. â€œIf billboards are ugly, let us start cleaning from the ugliest and get rid of slums, beggars, filth,â€™â€™ he says. â€œInstead, a section is targeting a legitimate industry which employs lakhs of people.â€™â€™

5,Hubli tense after communal clash,"HUBLI: Fourteen people were arrested as trouble erupted in Hubli on Wednesday when mobs of two different communities clashed over a trivial issue. The situation is under control now.

The police had to resort to lathi charge, open six rounds of fire in the air and lob tear gas shells to quell the violent mob. Two persons were injured and were admitted to the hospital.

Trouble broke out at around 6 am on Wednesday at Dhajibanpet in Hubli when members of a particular community objected to the use of loud speakers by the other community at a place of worship. The two groups entered into a pitched battle and pelted stones, bottles and other missiles. The street resembled a war zone following the violence.

Hubli-Dharwad Police Commissioner K.V. Gagandeep said that no fresh incidents had been reported since and the situation was under control.

As a precautionary measure, prohibitory orders have been clamped in Kamaripet and Town Police Station limits of Hubli till 10 am on Thursday, the Police Commissioner said.

Schools and educational institutions in Dhajibanpet and Kamaripet declared a holiday. However, they would be open on Thursday. Armed police have been deployed in sensitive areas and patrolling has been intensified in Hubli.

6,CM rules out Kolathur Mani's release,"BANGALORE: Ruling out Veerappanâ€™s demand of jailed Tamil activist Kolathur Mani as negotiator for hostage H. Nagappaâ€™s release, Chief Minister S.M. Krishna on Wednesday held out the olive branch of a ""free and fair trial"" if the brigand surrenders.

Responding to a resolution â€” passed by an unprecedented all-caste pontiffs meet â€” demanding Mani as Karnatakaâ€™s emissary, Krishna said: ""If all it required was an order to release Mani from jail, I would have done it long ago. But not only is it not possible, but itâ€™s also not justifiable.""

Hinting that Tamil Nadu had indicated it would not withdraw its four cases against Mani, Krishna contended: ""Some legal issues are beyond us. We seek your guidance to overcome them.""

On the pontiffsâ€™ offer to make Veerappan surrender, Krishna â€” echoing his stand during the Rajkumar kidnap two years ago â€” said: ""If he surrenders, we are prepared to provide Veerappan everything the rule of law guarantees, legal assistance and other help.""

The CM urged the seers to convey this message to Veerappan. Main organiser Suttur pontiff Shivaratri Deshikendra said: ""A message in Tamil will be broadcast via All India Radio (AIR).""

Krishna said the government had many cards up its sleeve and denied there has been a ""deliberate"" delay in securing Nagappaâ€™s release. ""Who needs controversy? Who will benefit from it? Who will be happy? But, circumstances are vastly different from the time of Rajkumarâ€™s release. We need to maintain calm and pursue things actively,"" he stated.

Earlier, in a show of solidarity, a â€˜Sathvika Ottaya Samaaveshhaâ€™ (meet to exert spiritual pressure) was held marking the 88th day after Nagappaâ€™s abduction. Leading Lingayat, Vokkaliga, Jain, Brahmin, Kuruba and Backward Class pontiffs jointly demanded an early end to the crisis.

In a whoâ€™s who of Karnatakaâ€™s religious map, Siddaganga pontiff Shivakumara Swami (Lingayat), Adichunchunagiri pontiff Balagangadharanath Swami (Vokkaliga), Pejawar pontiff Vishwesha Theertha Swami (Brahmin), Kumbalgod pontiff representing Charukeerthi Bhattaraka Swami of Shravanabelagola (Jain), Tarakananda Swami of Kaginele (Kuruba) and Veerabhadra Channamalla Swami of Nedumamidi math were present.

Given that Nagappa is a Lingayat, all major Lingayat seers including Chitradurgaâ€™s Shivamurthy Murugarajendra, Gadagâ€™s Thontadarya Swami, Belimathâ€™s Shivarudra Swami, Nidasosiâ€™s Siddaganga Swami and Shivagangaâ€™s Maleya Shantashivacharya Swami participated. Hubliâ€™s Moorusaavira math seer sent a message.

Shivakumara Swami, who presided, said: ""Veerappan should have been crushed years ago. What have all successive governments been doing?""

Balagangadharanath Swami said: ""The government was preoccupied with Cauvery. Now, attention should be on getting Nagappa back.""

The Pejawar seer suggested an appeal from all pontiffs via a cassette to Veerappan. ""We are bound to find human compassion in his heart also,"" he said.

Shivaratri Deshikendra said: ""Math leaders have buried differences and come to this common platform. The CM should forget party differences and get Nagappa back.""

Though all parties were present, only Lingayat leaders â€” KPCC president Allum Veerabhadrappa and BJP former state president B.S. Yediyurappa â€” represented their parties. JD(U) leaders and Nagappaâ€™s family attended.

7,Impose President's rule in state: Bhatia,"MUMBAI: An IAS officer has demanded that Maharashtra be brought under Presidentâ€™s rule because the state is witnessing a â€œbreakdown of constitutional machineryâ€™â€™.

Arun Bhatia, a long time crusader against corruption, has pegged his demand to the Democratic Front governmentâ€™s alleged inaction even in the face of alleged proof of corruption and irregularities.

In a letter written to President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam on November 17, Mr Bhatia, who heads the Tribal Research & Training Institute in Pune, concedes that the demand is unusual because the President has restricted himself to acting only upon governorâ€™s reports. However, he adds, Article 356 can be invoked in a situation where â€œthe government of the state cannot be carried on in accordance with the provisions of the Constitutionâ€™â€™. Citing a â€œbreakdown of constitutional machineryâ€™â€™, he lists the alleged causes: â€œgalloping corruption, misuse of public funds, cheating of citizens, unequal treatment before the law, protection of crime, exploitation of the poor, failure to implement essential schemes for the poor in spite of fund availability, absence of transparency and continuing violation of the rule of lawâ€™â€™.

Urging the President to take note, the letter says, â€œThe Article empowers you to act on receiving information from any source.â€™â€™ Anticipating the governmentâ€™s defence, Mr Bhatia says it will argue that the demand is absurd â€œbecause corruption is an international phenomenon, that it can never be totally removed, that numerous offenders have been punished, that Article 356 deals only with failure to form a government or command a majority in the legislature, that if Article 356 is burdened with such a wide interpretation no government will survive, etcâ€™â€™.

This stand, Mr Bhatia contends, will be a â€œnarrow and unjustified interpretation on Article 356â€™â€™ and that, in fact, â€œthe makers of the Constitution wished to arm the President to remedy abuse of power by the executiveâ€™â€™. Moreover, he reasons, â€œWe are referring not to complaints from the public but to cases reported to the government after a preliminary investigation in which the government has not acted.â€™â€™ A collapse of governance has to be inferred when the government is indifferent even in the face of preliminary investigations and audit reports, which establish a prima facie case for action. Mr Bhatia then lists cases detected by the tribal research institute itself to prove his point: malnutrition-related deaths of children, no employment opportunities in needy areas under the employment guarantee scheme, corruption in the subsidy scheme for pregnant tribal women, corruption cases against officials (talathis and circle officers at the village and circle levels) in Pune division, corruption in the Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad local bodies, shielding â€˜corruptâ€™ senior officers, etc.

Contending that â€œthe state government has failed to fulfil its mandate of constitutional governanceâ€™â€™, Mr Bhatia also complains of government attempts to crush his dissenting views. â€œThere is also nothing in the conduct rules of public servants which prohibits honest research,â€™â€™ he stresses. On the contrary, it was his duty as the TRTI commissioner to do this research.

â€œIf a research institute can detect corruption so easily what prevents the government from detecting and stopping corruption?â€™â€™ he asks.

9,'Quran contains scientific principles',"HYDERABAD: The Holy Quran, which was bestowed on man during the month of R a m z a n about 1,400 years ago, has a scientific outlook and if studied carefully would reveal numerous scientific facts and principles. These can unravel the mysteries of not just the universe but the functioning of nature and humans too.

At a discourse, ''Commemoration of Quran: Quran and Scientific Facts'' organised by the Muslim Girls Association at Nafees Manzil on Wednesday, convener of the programme Munnawar Sultana said there are numerous Aayaths (verses) in the Quran which speak of what are now called ''scientific discoveries and facts''.

For instance, one of the Aayaths, says ''He has created you in the mother''s womb in three kinds of darkness. Passing from one genesis to the next...''. ""Science now tells us that the foetus is enveloped in three different tissues,â€� she pointed out.

10,Phase II of MUL disinvestment to start in Dec,"NEW DELHI: The government would commence next month the second stage of disinvestment of car-major Maruti Udyog through a public offering for 25 per cent equity, a senior Disinvestment Ministry official said.

The disinvestment would be through a book-building route and this is likely to start by middle of next month, Disinvestment secretary Pradeep Baijal said here.

Suzuki Motor Corporation of Japan, which is the other stakeholder in the car-major, would underwrite the public offer at Rs 2300 per share as per its agreement with the Government.

This follows the refusal by market regulator Sebi for allowing hard underwriting proposed by Disinvestment Ministry on the ground that the existing underwriting norms could not be diluted.

Under the soft underwriting option, Suzuki of Japan which earlier this year acquired majority stake in the auto major through a rights issue, would underwrite the public offering of 25 per cent government equity of 36 lakh shares.

The second phase of disinvestment of Maruti may perhaps mark the revival of the overall disinvestment process, which has at present come to a virtual standstill following opposition from various sections.

The government had in May this year ceded controlling stake in the company by renouncing its share in Rs 400 crore rights issue to Suzuki Motors for a control premium of Rs 1000 crore.

It had also agreed to divest its remaining equity of around of 45 per cent in two phases first by paring its equity holding down to 20 per cent by 2003 and selling of the remaining by 2004.

Government also put an option on the remaining equity at a discount of 15 per cent or 10 per cent of market price till April 2004 at the book value of Rs 2000 or value prevailing at time of option, whichever is higher.

Prior to first round of disinvestment, Suzuki held 50 per cent stake while the government held 49.74 per cent and the remaining was held by employees.

Japanese auto major had agreed to make MUL the source for some of its models and assist it in acessing new export markets.

15,"Ask Modi to include Pandya, Advani tells Naidu","NEW DELHI: Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani told BJP president Venkaiah Naidu on Thursday that he should ""immediately"" and, with a firm hand, sort out the dissidence in the party's Gujarat unit. This includes ""persuading"" chief minister Narendra Modi to agree to alloting the Ellisbridge assembly seat in Ahmedabad to chief BJP dissident Haren Pandya.At an hour-long meeting of top party functionaries here, when the third list of candidates for next month's Gujarat polls was finalised taking the list of declared names to 167 the consensus was that Pandya should be allowed to contest from Ellisbridge. Advani reportedly said it was not a question of one seat or one Haren Pandya; rather, the unnecassary controversy created by the refusal to give the seat to Pandya could have a ""ripple effect"". He stressed that the BJP could not afford to take any risks in Gujarat as the results would mark a ""turning point"" for the party, nationally, for better or worse. Sources added Pandya still had a 50-50 chance of being given the seat.Modi's line, the sources said, is that if the party did not take a serious view of the indiscipline in the party, things would go out of hand. Advani's approach is that it was more important to look at the bigger picture. A party functionary, when asked why the top leadership could not get Modi to agree, replied ruefully: ""Modi is Modi.""The Godhra assembly seat is also proving to be a headache for the BJP. Party sources said initially, the choice had ended with Gopalsinh Solanki, an ex-Rajya Sabha member, who had played a key role in Congress state chief Shankersinh Vaghela's defeat in 1998 in the Godhra Lok Sabha constituency. In the post-Godhra period, Solanki had kept Modi posted about developments in the entire Panchmahals district. But now Modi is pushing for Haresh Bhatta, a VHP functionary who joined the BJP recently.Apart from the rebellion in the state unit, Thursday's meeting attended by the Advani, Naidu, former party president Kushabhau Thakre, and general secretaries Rajnath Singh and Mukthar Abbas Naqvi, also decided on campaign and manifesto details. The day the BJP launches its campaign formally ^ November 30 or December 1 ^ 20 big rallies will be addressed by top leaders, including Advani, Naidu, Murli Manohar Joshi, Pramod Mahajan, Sushma Swaraj, Jaswant Singh and Shatrughan Sinha, across the state. The PM, who will go later in two phases, will not be among them.The manifesto will focus on the developmental achievements of the BJP-led government at the Centre and the state, as well as attack the Congress for the ""negative"" image it has created for Gujarat post-Godhra. Speakers have been asked to focus on developmental issues, but if the Congress continues to bring up Godhra and the communal issue, the party should not be defensive; rather, it should go on the offensive.

16,Bar contestants woo district lawyers,"CHANDIGARH: On the penultimate day of elections to the Bar Council of Punjab and Haryana, contestants marshalled their powers of persuasion to garner support of local lawyers at the district courts in Sector 17.The court premises witnessed hectic election activity on Thursday as lawyers went on eleventh-hour campaigning sprees.It was palpable that wannabe council members had thronged the courts to breathe life into old connections as well as forge productive last-minute alliances. Embarking on the task of making their election prospects brighter, contestants flanked by a retinue of supporters showed up at the courts rather early.Former Punjab and Haryana High Court Bar Association president Daya Chaudhary says she was out of bed at 4.30 am to systematise the day's schedule.She says, ""Some voters were insistent they be contacted a day prior to the election. I headed straight for the district courts in the morning to brush up old links and request support of women lawyers, a constituency I am primarily relying on.""An electorate of over 29,000 advocates in Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh will decide the fate of 116 candidates in the fray for the bar council elections. The city accounts for roughly 5,600 voters, including 600 women.Whereas campaigning in the flesh certainly puts telephonic canvassing in the shadow, the latter isn't passe yet as contestants did phone up lawyers for their support.Navkiran Singh, eyeing a bar council seat for the first time, made at least 100 phone calls before setting out on his itinerary that included visits to high court, district courts, income-tax bar association and estate office.He says, ""My main concern is to meet as many lawyers as possible."" An entourage of more than 50 human rights lawyers was accompanying Navkiran.GK Chatrath, former Punjab advocate general and a contestant, also opened his final campaign with a visit to the district courts. He says, ""I am here to tell voters that I represent the ideology they stand for."" Chatrath had also organised lunch for women lawyers at the high court and dinner for others at his residence. Local lawyers will cast their votes on Friday, the rest are scheduled to take part in the election on November 23. The first round of counting will begin on November 26.

17,'Gujarat’s Amitabh' faces protests within BJP,"VADODARA: The political career of Gujarat''s Amitabh Bachchan, the famous Gujarati film hero Naresh Kanodia, isnâ€™t taking off the way he wanted.

Though Kanodia is an immensely popular and prolific Gujarati actor, the news of his candidature from Karjan has led to loud protests from the BJP supporters there.

On the eve of Kanodia''s visit to Karjan here on Thursday, BJP party workers supporting Amit Jethwa burnt an effigy of Kanodia and even displayed placards saying â€˜Naresh hataao Bhajap bachaoâ€™.

However, sources say party higher-ups soon put a stop to the protests by threatening workers that they would be expelled from the party for indiscipline. As a result, when Kanodia reached Karjan, he was welcomed with flowers by some BJP party workers.

Speaking to TNN, Kanodia, who was on way to Karjan, said, ""I know there are protests there, but I am merely following the orders of the higher-ups. I have been asked to render my ''seva'' for the people of Karjan, and I will do my best to ensure that I do everything to help Karjan.""

""I can understand that some party workers have felt unhappy over ticket-distribution, but I hope to convince them that I have the best interest of the people in my heart,"" he said.

About his political future going the Big B way, he said with a hearty laugh, ""I hope not. Especially since I have the guidance of my elder brother Mahesh Kanodia who is an established BJP leader.""

However, Amit Jethwa a city-based builder and businessman who has land in Karjan and is a senior BJP party leader since the past decade said, ""I had the support of the entire unit of party workers of Karjan. They support me because they know that I am always in touch with them,"" he said.

""My supporters also oppose Kanodia as they feel that like actress Deepika Chikhalia,who was given the party ticket to contest from Vadodara in previous elections, Kandoia too would go away once he is elected.""

Kanodia, however, says he is determined to work in the interest of people. I have succeeded in the Gujarati film industry due to the love of people. We have risen from abject poverty and know the people''s problems. I will be at the service of the people,"" he said.

Kanodia has a career spanning 30 years in the Gujarati films and has worked in more than 100 films.He will file his nomination on Friday at 1.30 pm.

18,Protest over police entry incorrect: Kirtani Jatha,"JALANDHAR: The Prabandhki Panchain of Akhand Kirtani Jatha (International) has expressed its concern on the turn of events at the time of the annual SGPC office-bearers'' election with the action of the police in evicting the guests of Guru Ram Das from serais situated in the Darbar Sahib complex.

Equally reprehensible is the failure of the SGPC in not being able to keep the Darbar Sahib complex, free from police presence, a press release of the jatha says.

""Uniformed policemen were every where and all the office bearers, SGPC members of all shades of Akalis and even the Takht Jathedars waded through the sea of police to reach the meeting venue without even mute protest or objection. As such the present hue and cry over the alleged police entry is nothing but misleading. All those who attended the meeting thus cannot escape the moral responsibility for this sacrilege,"" said Prof Gurmukh Singh, member Prabandhki Panchain.

The press release further states that the daily prayer of the Sikhs as given in the Sikh Rahit Maryada (The Sikh Code of Conduct) clearly mentions the ''Bungas'' (hostels) as: ""May hym-singing missionary parties, the flags, the hostels, abide from age to age. May righteousness reign supreme.""

The simple meaning of complex is the combination of different buildings. A single building is not a complex. As such the space between different buildings of the Darbar Sahib is part and parcel of the Complex, it adds.

The press release adds: ""It is further distressing to note that the pathway leading to the Darbar Sahib is being made disputable. It is a fact of history that the holy city of Amritsar was built by Guru Ram Das ji after purchasing the land and was known as Chak Ram Das. The whole city of Amritsar belongs to Guru Ram Das ji but now even the path situated inside the Golden Temple complex is being termed as disputed. No one except the panthic leaders and the panthic governments are responsible for this.""

Prof Gurmukh Singh discloses that ""the most distressing fact is that even a part of the parikarma has been leased out to a commercial bank well within the knowledge of then Jathedar Akal Takht Manjit Singh.

This is bartering the sanctity of the Darbar Sahib by the SGPC authorities. The Gurdwara Reforms Movement was started in protest against the commercialisation of the Harimandir Sahib complex. Is the clock being set back again?

19,Order on eviction of tribals may affect polls,"SURAT: Representation to the Supreme Court by five tribal chiefs from Dangs earlier this month, demanding cancellation of the eviction order of tribals from the forest lands, is likely to have political ramifications in the ensuing assembly elections.

This when, only 1,273 hectares â€” just over one per cent of the total reserved forest area â€” in South Gujarat has been officially recorded as new areas under encroachment this year.

Sources told TNN that around 612 hectares were vacated by mid-September, resulting in an uprising among several pockets of tribal areas in Ahwa-Dangs and in interiors of Surat. The reason being, majority of the tribals eke out a living on forest produce through shifting cultivation.

Several local level organisations, like Dang Rajvi Adhikar Parishad (DARP), have planned village-level meetings to create awareness among the tribals on this issue. A meeting was held on Wednesday at Kausimida village in the Dangs, to commemorate the death anniversary of Taraben, who was killed in 1992 in police firing, according to Avinash Gangurte of DARP. A statue of Taraben was also unveiled on the occasion, he told TNN.

The whole exercise gains significance as activists from this regionwould like to draw maximum mileage in the days to come, according to office-bearers of Adivasi Vikas Sangthan (AVS). In fact, AVS has been active in motivating the tribals and has been opposing the Supreme Courtâ€™s order to â€˜summarily evictâ€™ encroachers.

In other parts of South Gujarat, a number of meetings were also held by another organisation, the Adivasi Ekta Parishad, in the last three months in protest against the apex courtâ€™s decision.

Owing to rampant illiteracy and absence of means of livelihood, tribals depend on seasonal cultivation and evicting them from the local base would raise questions on their survival and the recent uprising would definitely have political connotations, according to sociologist Satyakam Joshi.

20,Punjab signs MoU with South African province,"CHANDIGARH: The Punjab government has signed three Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) with the South African province of Limpopo for bilateral cooperation and exchanges in the fields of agriculture, trade, commerce, education, youth development, sports as well as science and technology.

The first two MoUs were singed by Limpopo''s premier Adv N Ramatlhodi and Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh, while the third one was signed by Limpopo''s member agriculture executive council Aron Motsoaledi and Punjab agriculture minister Rajinder Kaur Bhattal.

A spokesman of the Punjab government said here on Thursday, that the first MoU was about exchange and cooperation in education, youth development and sports and technology. The second MoU aims at establishing an inter-provincial relationship in the field of economy, trade, science and technology, agriculture, tourism, applied research and education.

The third MoU is related to exchange and co-operation in the field of agriculture.

The Limpopo premier, while talking to Amarinder Singh, said that there was tremendous scope for development of agriculture in his province whose resources were yet to be exploited.

He said his government would send a delegation of progressive farmers to Punjab Agriculture University (PAU), Ludhiana, to interact with leading farmers here.

21,Four ministers in BJP's list of 12 nominees,"AHMEDABAD: After prolonged discussions, the Bharatiya Janata Party on Thursday cleared the candidature of state urban development minister I K Jadeja and finance minister Nitin Patel, alongwith 10 other candidates including two junior ministers and five sitting members, a majority of them hailing from North Gujarat region.

The BJP has dropped Arvind Patel, a senior party leader and sitting MLA from Chansma, who was water supply minister in the BJP ministry of 1995. He was denied ministership in the Keshubhai Patel ministry in 1998 following anti-party activities.

Dr T I Patel, vicepresident of Mehsana district BJP committee, has been nominated in his place.

Former president of Ahmedabad district panchayat, Ramilaben Desai, has been renominated from Kheralu. She had lost to the Congress with a narrow margin in the last elections.

Besides Jadeja and Patel, the BJP has renominated two other junior ministers â€” Ishverbhai Makwana and Sundersinh Chauhan â€” from Jotana and Mehmedabad respectively. The party has retained Prahladbhai Patel, a close aide of finance minister from Visnagar constituency.

The election committee has renominated Karsanbhai Odedara from Kutiyana constituency in Porbander district.

In a surprising move, the BJP has named Dr Jitubhai Patel, a leading orthopaedic surgeon for the prestigious Sabarmati assembly constituency from where the Congress has already fielded former deputy chief minister Narhari Amin. Patel was elected as vice-president of the state chapter of Indian Medical Association.

It seems Modi has played an important role in the selection of candidates in North Gujarat constituencies.

22,Depositors to raise issue of collapsing banks during polls,"AHMEDABAD: With 18 lakh depositors in Gujarat losing over Rs 1,500 crore since January 2002, not including the Madhavpura Mercantile Cooperative Bank, the All Gujarat Co-op Banks Depositors, Account Holders Association has decided to make this a major issue in the elections.

Out of about 350 urban co-operative banks (UCBs) in the state, around 20 UCBs have closed since January 2002 and another 50 to 60 are listed as weak banks which may close in future.

""The association will fight against Narendra Modi in the Maninagar constituency and we will do our level best to ensure his defeat. As the chief minister he represented the state government, but he failed to do anything for the depositors even after repeated promises for the past several months,"" said Prakash Gujar, president of the association.

""We will also fight against the Congress, which has also done nothing for depositors. In fact, majority of the co-operatives banks in the state are controlled by Congressmen. The association is also going to fight against Narhari Amin of Congress who is contesting from the Sabarmati constituency,"" he added.

""Politicians from both the parties have been actively involved in some of the major co-op bank scams. The entire co-op banking sector has become politicised and neither recoveries nor any other action can be taken against most of the scamsters. Neither party is willing to take action against powerful politicians who have been involved in the scams,"" said Gujar.

Rajesh Patel, secretary of the association said that around 125 cooperative bank branches have closed in Gujarat, with about 50 of them being in Ahmedabad.

""Around 63 assembly seats have cases of closed banks and nearly 18 lakh depositors have lost money. Neither the BJP nor the Congress have done anything to help depositors to recover their money,"" said Patel.

Gujar said that they are meeting the governor on November 22 to request him to work out a relief package.

They also plan to go to Delhi and try to raise their case in the ongoing Parliament session there. He said that in spite of so many depositors having lost their money in the state, neither the BJP nor the Congress MPs have raised this issue in Parliament.

""We have also written to the Chief Election Commissioner and the state-level EC official to ask both the BJP and Congress to announce a relief package which will be implemented irrespective of which party comes to power. It is only before elections that we can pressurise the political parties to do something. Because once they come to power, they will do nothing for the lakhs of depositors who have lost their money,"" said Patel.

Gujar wants the Central government to extend a relief package of Rs 1,000 to Rs 1,500 crore to the co-op banks in Gujarat. He says the entire co-op banking sector is facing a crisis, and if no relief package is provided then most of the remaining UCBs would also close in future.

The collapse of the Madhavpura Bank (MMCB) in March 2001 started the crisis for UCBs in the state. In January 2002, General Co-op Bank in Ahmedabad and Charotar Bank at Anand closed. Genco had deposits of Rs 115 crore and advances of Rs 130 crore while Charotar had Rs 350 crore and Rs 434 crore respectively.

Another big bank, Visnagar headquartered at Visnagar closed in August â€” bank had deposits of Rs 448 crore and advances of Rs 561.5 crore.

23,"File at 12.39 pm, get off to a winning start","AHMEDABAD/RAJKOT: 12.39 pm IST. This is precisely when senior Congress candidate Narhari Amin will file his nomination papers for the assembly elections. Not a minute earlier, or later!

Health minister and senior BJP candidate Ashok Bhatt will reach the collectorate at noon to file his nomination, but he too will ensure that his papers are accepted at 12.39 pm sharp! At the same time, BJP candidate Amit Shah will file his nomination for the Sarkhej constituency.

If youâ€™re wondering what the big deal about 12.39 pm is, itâ€™s all about an aucpicious begining to the election campaign, at what is known as Vijay Muhuratâ€™ in Gujarat.

And like any another battle, timing is of essence, especially for ""star-truck"" politicians. ""To make a confession, I am superstitious about filing my papers at 12.39 only. I believe in it and try to keep to it every time while filing nominations.

It has proved lucky for me in the past and am sure it will bring me luck this time too,"" Amin told TNN.He conceded that he will leave for filing nominations at 10 in the morning so as to have ample time to reach the nomination office.

Tradition has it that any task undertaken at this precise hour ensures victory. ""It is known as the â€˜madhyahna kaalâ€™ and is considered the most auspicious time of the day to proceed with or formalise any important task.

This hour holds special signifiance for the people of Gujarat, many of whom adhere to it in daily life too,"" says astrologer Bhikhabhai Patel.

""Iâ€™m not the religious type to go to temples and pray. But Vijay Muhurat is an inseparable part of our culture and societal beliefs, and one feels compelled to honour it. Then of course, there is this confidence of starting at the best time... it helps,"" quips Mayor Himmatsinh Patel, who is all set to file his nomination amidst fanfare.

Whatâ€™s interesting is that the compulsion to stick to the astrological deadline cuts across party lines. So, Congress candidate from Rajkot-3 Shanta Chavda and her BJP opponent, Vajubhai Vala, will both reaching the collectorâ€™s office together and cooperate to keep their date with the muhurat!

""We are to jointly go and fill up the form at 12.39 pm and will ensure that the muhurat time is kept by both,"" says Vala.

Election officials at the collectorate acknowledge the fetish of politicians for the Vijay Muhurat. ""In case politicians from rival camps insist on submission of papers at 12.39 pm, we divide the duty between the returning officer and the assistant returning officer,"" says deputy district election officer in Ahmedabad, DH Parmar.

And what happens if more than two candidates turn up, insisting on filing nominations on Vijay Muhurat?

""Then we cater to them on a first-come-first-served basis,"" says Parmar.

24,Sardul Singh rules out ST exemption for dhaba owners,"LUDHIANA: Punjab excise minister Sardul Singh, on Thursday, ruled out complete exemption of sales tax (ST) imposed on dhabha owners in the state.

However, the government was not averse to the idea of giving them a concession.

A assurance to this effect was given by the minister to delegation of Punjab state Dhabha Association, during an informal meeting at the residence of prominent Congress leader, Amarjit Singh Tikka, at Harnam Nagar here.

Sardul Singh told TNN that after the meeting, of which he was a part, between chief minister Amarinder Singh, finance minister Lal Singh and union leaders, at Chandigarh, a sub-committee had been formed to deliberate on the matter. A meeting of the committee would be convened during the next week to find out how to provide maximum relief to the dhabha owners, he said.

The minister also responded positively to the suggestions made by Punjab Pradesh Beopar Mandal president and prominent party leader, Jagmohan Sharma, who pleaded the union''s case with the minister.

Sharma suggested that instead of taxing the dhabha owners regularly at the rate of 8.8 per cent sales tax on food items, the government could charge a reasonable amount once year. Since dhabha business was not big enough to warrant tax, affordable tax amount could ensure more revenue to the government coffers, Sharma said.

After meeting the minister, Sardari Lal and Inderjit Singh Gill, chairman and president of the union, reiterated that taxing them would affect the common man because they would have to raise their rates.

But doing so was likely to affect business adversely, as the union leaders fear that the customers could lose business to restaurants.

At present, about 99 per cent dhabha operators are illiterate, so maintaining records with regard to issue bills and income tax returns, would be a difficult proposition, they said.

25,Citizens tribunal indicts Modi for riots,"AHMEDABAD: In the worst indictment of the BJP government in Gujarat since the communal riots broke out in February, the Concerned Citizens tribunal headed by a retired judge of the Supreme Court, Justice Krishna Iyer, released on Thursday a comprehensive report on the â€˜genocideâ€™ in which over 1,000 people were killed.

Talking of the stateâ€™s complicity in the violence, the report said: ""The post-Godhra carnage in Gujarat was an organised crime perpetrated by the stateâ€™s chief minister and his government.""

It also named the stateâ€™s chief secretary, home secretary and DGP as ""accused"" in the eyes of the victims. The report is expected to be submitted to President A P J Abdul Kalam in Delhi on Friday.

But while the report has not spared anybody, including the media, the secular outfits and the central government, there is special mention of Chief Minister Modi in the chapter on â€˜State Complicityâ€™ where the report described him as ""the chief author and architect of all that happened in Gujarat after February 27"". Apart from indicting him for the violence, the report accuses him of refusing relief and rehabilitation to the victims.

The report, titled â€˜Crime Against Humanityâ€™, runs into two huge volumes, and is by far the most comprehensive report on the riots having based itself on 2,094 statements. Senior advocate, K G Kannabiran, a member of the tribunal, told mediapersons, ""The report is comprehensive enough for any central agency to file charge-sheets against everybody from Narendra Modi downwards.""

Justice (retd) H Suresh and Justice (retd) P B Sawant, two other members of the tribunal, also spoke on the occasion.

The tribunal observed that there was still an element of mystery about how the Sabarmati Express compartment had caught fire at Godhra. ""It is clear that the fire was set from the inside, but who did it is still not clear,"" said Justice Suresh.

The report alleged that cadres of the VHP and Bajrang Dal were trained to target Muslims ""and the Godhra incident provided an opportunity"".

It said, ""The uniform pattern of violence in Gujarat the day after the Godhra incident showed that the killings were pre-planned.""

Kannabiran was clear that these were not just communal riots. ""This was a clear case of genocide and there was military planning and precision behind the attacks,"" he said.

The report mentioned the shifting of bodies of Godhra victims to Ahmedabad the same night, Modiâ€™s conclusion the same day that the attack on the train was pre-planned by the ISI and the bandh call given by the VHP and supported by the BJP the next day as ""evidence of a well thought out scheme to extract maximum political capital out of Godhra"".

It said that nearly 1,150 hotels owned by Muslims were burnt down or looted in acts of arson. Similarly, 270 mosques and dargahs were burnt down. The total loss suffered by the minority community in the riots was put at Rs 1,800 crore by the tribunal, which has classified the damage to shrines as ""cultural genocide"".

The report talks about a meeting between two ministers held late in the evening on February 27 at Lunawada in which ""a diabolical plan was drawn and disseminated to the top 50 leaders of the BJP, RSS, Bajrang Dal and VHP on the method and the manner in which the 72-hour-long carnage that followed was to be carried out.""

It also attacked the police and the administration for toeing the political line and said, ""There is no way such levels of violence could have taken place had the police and the district administration stood by their constitutional obligation.""

26,Prince of Wales Museum opened to public,"MUMBAI: Sunlight bounces off the steel and glass in new gallery of the Prince of Wales Museum that opened to the public on Thursday.

The first of its kind in Mumbai, this spacious gallery with its state-of-the-art facilities of climate control, lighting and infra-red security will fill a crucial void in the cityâ€™s cultural infrastructure. Mumbai can finally host exhibitions from around the world. Named the Premchand Roychand Gallery, it has been funded by the Roychand family to mark the 150th anniversary of the founding of the business group. Premchand Roychand, the philanthropic but controversial stock broker of the 19th century, was the man who contributed two lakh rupees to build the Gothic University clock tower for his mother Rajabai,who could not read the time because of failing eyesight and thus depended on the clock chimes to tell the hour.

â€œThere are two reasons for sponsoring the gallery,â€™â€™ says his great-grandson Sushil Premchand. â€œFirst, we wanted to recalibrate our focus on Premchand Roychand and secondly, we wanted to give back to the city in a tangible way.â€™â€™ And what better form of payback than to bolster the Prince of Wales, a venerable old institution financially on its knees? Hopefully, the global gallery will draw back both audiences and money. Mr Premchand hopes that companies that wish to make an impact in a quiet way will sponsor shows. Apart from the Premchand Roychand gallery, there are five other galleries, including one dedicated to the Karl Khandalawala collection. â€œItâ€™s like a dream coming true before my eyes,â€™â€™ says museum director Kalpana Desai.

The family declines to specify the amount it donated. â€œHow much we give is of interest to everybody but relevance to nobody,â€™â€™ says Mr Premchand. He adds that the one of the main reasons for choosing the Prince of Wales Museum was that it had autonomous status.Both Ms Desai and the board threw their weight behind the project and the gallery was ready a good three years before schedule. The gallery could become a reality because the Prince of Wales had the most priceless asset to offer in a city thirsting for itâ€”space. Only, the 25,000 square feet of space in its East Wing had been reduced to a godown, a repository of cartons and damp.

The godown-to-gallery journey was chalked out by conservation architect Rahul Mehrotra and his team.Over a period of three years, the East Wing, which was structurally no more than a massive block with one door, was reconfigured into a sky-lit, insulated, ducted gallery with smoke-detectors and infra-red beams. The opening exhibit consists of masterpieces drawn from the museumâ€™s collection â€”including a sheer swathe of Dhaka muslin. But in the future, it will host international exhibitions. Hopefully, Mumbai will no longer play second-fiddle to Delhi, which was treated to the splendour of the Padshahnamah from England because it had a gallery that met international standards.

Another advantage is the establishment of a modern conservation studio. â€œFor a museum, having its own restoration facility is like having light and water,â€™â€™ says Mr Premchandâ€™s wife Neeta. The Premchand bounty comes with one string attachedâ€”the contract with the museum has a clause which states that if the name is changed, funding will be withdrawn. So one thingâ€™s for sureâ€”the Chhatrapati Shivaji Museum formerly known as the Prince of Wales Museum wonâ€™t have a Chhatrapati Shivaji gallery within.
