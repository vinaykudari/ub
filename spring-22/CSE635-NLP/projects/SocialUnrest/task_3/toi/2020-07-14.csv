0,'Practising' govt doctors 'privately' scared,"LUCKNOW: Fresh government directions for strict implementation of ban orders on private practice has made no impact on practising faculty members of Chhatrapati Shahuji Maharaj Medical University (CSMMU).

However, apprehension has gripped some of them after the formation of a vigilance committee by the state government to crack down on practising faculty members as the committee is supposed to act on the recommendations of the head of the institution and the present vicechancellor of CSMMU is a non-practising man.

Questions are being raised as to who was responsible for slipping in the name of CSMMU in government order along with other state medical colleges. â€œA similar move three months back was scuttled,â€� disclosed a faculty member. Many are remembering the good old days when they were under Lucknow University.

The reason: a similar GO in 1998 was put in abeyance by the LU executive council. But now the equations in the CSMMU executive council do not favour practising teachers as there are no elected members in the council, who can reflect their â€˜sentimentsâ€™. A GO is binding only after it is adopted by the university executive council. However, ban orders also exist in the CSMMU Act and there are also Supreme Court and High Court directions recommending ban on private practice.

Private practice is deep rooted in CSMMU. On an average, a faculty member earns between Rs 40,000 and Rs 1 lakh per month. Not only senior professors, but associated professors, lecturers and even residents are into private practice.

Interestingly, ward boys, nurses and other para-medical staff too are actively engaged in the business and serve in private clinics and nursing homes after working hours. Touts hired by private nursing homes and hospitals, owned by these members could, also be seen lingering on the campus catching patients and directing them to private clinics.

But justifying private practice, many faculty members demanded: â€œFirst the government should make our take-home salary scale between Rs 30,000 and Rs 50,000, with free residential accommodation, extra allowance for academic activities and research and not to mention better working conditions and then it should talk about implementing the ban orders. We look up to the vicechancellor to first get us a respectable pay scale and then implement the ban,â€� they added.

After 15-17 years of study, a person becomes eligible for lectureship in medical colleges. But basic pay of a lecturer in CSMMU is around Rs 8000, which is less than the salary of a senior government clerk. Similarly, a professor gets Rs 18,500 basic salary, which is equal to what a reader in degree colleges gets. In sharp contrast, in SGPGIMS, the salary is between Rs 26,000 - Rs 35,000.

On the charge that faculty members used university infrastructure to keep themselves update and enhance their skills, but encash them through private practice, another senior professor retorted: â€œWhen politicians can take commissions and become rich overnight, bureaucrats are neck-deep in corruption and count money while sitting in their cool and cozy offices, then what is wrong in private practice. At least, we provide relief to people.â€� â€œThe government should focus on removing â€˜malpracticeâ€™ and not â€˜private practiceâ€™,â€� he said pointing towards rampant corruption in government hospitals, where doctors were charging money from hospital patients for performing operations.

2,"Tension prevails in Akota as youths clash, 14 arrested","VADODARA: Tension prevailed in the Akota area here after a clash between youngsters of different communities in the wee hours of Monday. The clash was an outcome of a quarrel that occurred at a multiplex in the city some time back.

According to police sources, a major clash occurred between youngsters who had quarrelled earlier and wanted to settle scores, near the Akota Garden around 1 am on Monday.

The youngsters had gathered there for a compromise between some boys over a petty quarrel during a dance party at a multiplex in the city.

But with an argument during the meeting worsening, the groups involved pulled out weapons and attacked each other. Fourteen persons, from the Fatehpura area, were arrested in connection with the incident.

An FIR filed in this regard with the J P Road police station by one Vipul Nare alleges that a friend''s hand had mistakenly hit one Guddu at the Inox Multiplex during a dance party there.

The incident had led to a brawl on the same day. On Sunday night, Nare and others had gone to meet Guddu and his friends to make a compromise.

However, the FIR states, Guddu and others beat them up and damaged a motorcycle using sticks and a sword. Two motorcycles were also charred on the spot.

A cross-complaint filed by one Shabbir Patel has alleged that Nare, Vikas Rana and about eight other persons had come to attack them in connection with the incident during the dance party.

They allegedly attacked Patel and his friends at the Akota Garden.

A posse of policemen rushed to spot in wake of the incident. Members of both the groups, however, fled from the spot before they could be nabbed. However, it came to light that members of one of the groups were from the Fatehpura area of the city while those from the other group were residents of Akota.

Police sources said, ""It was essentially a clash between youngsters who had a quarrel earlier and wanted to settle scores.""

5,Delayed monsoon weeds out farming,"CHIKMAGALUR: With monsoon playing hide and seek with the district, sowing operations, especially that of horticultural crop, has still remained grounded. Only 4 per cent of the operations have been completed as yet.

Zilla panchayat president A.N. Mahesh told The Times of India that crops such as onion, chilli, tomato and sweet potato, which should have made a beginning in the normal course of monsoon, are the worst hit. Only small tracts of land in the peripheries of Kadur, Tarikere and parts of Chikmagalur taluks are pockmarked with signs of sprouts.

Chikmagalur taluk, whose 2,797-hectare land is heir to horticultural crops such as potato, chilli, beans, brinjal, beetroot and cabbage, is yet to witness operations. Rain that lashed the taluk in the beginning of June did pave the way for sowing potato crop and other vegetables on a large scale but the failure of rain altogether after a week has caused concern among farmers.

If rain plays truant for another fortnight or so, potato crop will suffer and selling stunted potato will be another nightmare to live through. The taluk has so far received 174 mm rainfall for January-June period, 99 mm less than the normal. As far as agricultural crops to be sown on 2,047-hectare land in the taluk, only 631 hectares have sprung to life with crops such as groundnut and sunflower, thanks to the dry spell.

The picture is not very different in Kadur taluk, where normally onion is sown in 950 hectares, chilli in 600 hectares and tomato in 1,200 hectares. Drought-like situation has deferred the sowing activity in the taluk for an indefinite, and also equally uncertain, period. The taluk received 106 mm rainfall during January-June period against the normal of 167 mm. Agricultural crops such as ragi, local jowar, sesame, sunflower and other crops are suffering from the dry spell. Of the 10,700 hectares of land readied, only 2,068 hectares are active. The sowing operations in the worst-hit taluk of Tarikere have virtually come to a standstill, with a rainfall of 55 mm rain during January-June period against the normal of 211 mm.

Farmers have sharpened agricultural implements, including yoke, for fruitful foray, but they have remained in the backyard. Of the 37,500-hectare sowing area in the taluk, only sowing hybrid cotton in 50 hectares, groundnut in 35 hectares and hybrid jowar in 160 hectares has been taken up, that, too, subject to the vagaries of monsoon. There is no word yet on the horticulture crops such as onion, grown in 2,200 hectares in Kasaba, Shivani and Ajjampura hoblis of the taluk. In Malnad, preparatory work such as nursery bed has been completed in anticipation of a good monsoon which has turned out to be a chimera. Hence, transplantation has been hit.

Mudigere taluk received 429 mm rain from January to June, a shortfall of 53 mm. Koppa was better placed with 456 mm rainfall, 92 mm less. Sringeri, said to be the wettest in the district, has received 896 mm rain, a deficit of 205 mm. It rained 235 mm in Narasimharajapura, 100 mm below normal.

6,SUCI to call bandh in August,"KOLKATA: The SUCI has decided to call a Bangla bandh in the third week of August to demand, among others, reduction in power tariff and withdrawal of bus fare increase and the state government''s decision to introduce capitation fee in medical education.

This will be the fourth Bangla bandh in the state this year. The party has also urged all the electricity consumers in Kolkata to switch off lights for half an hour on July 19 to force the government and the power utility to lower power tariff.

The state committee of the SUCI, which received several demands from members that the bandh be called for two consecutive days instead of for a single day, authorised the state secretariat to decide on the issue during its meeting to be held on Tuesday. The party had earlier threatened 48-hour bandh if its demands were not met.

The students'' wing of the SUCI â€” the AIDSO â€” has already called a state-wide students'' strike on July 29 to demand a withdrawal of the West Bengal government''s decision to introduce capitation fees in medical colleges of the state.

The AIDSO has also demanded reduction of tuition fees and is protesting against what it describes as the BJP-led central government''s plans to replace secular education with a Hindutva-based education system.

The party has also planned a large demonstration of workers in Kolkata on July 25 to protest against retrenchment and forced retirement of workers in the state as well as against the Centre and the state government''s anti-worker policies.

The SUCI''s decision to go for a Bangla bandh comes in the wake of chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee''s ever hardening resolve against any form of militancy in agitation.

Bhattacharjee had repeatedly urged political parties and trade unions in recent times not to resort to frequent strikes and wildcat agitations, arguing that this would have an adverse impact on the investment climate in the state.

7,94 silk farms to be privatised,"BANGALORE: It is Karnatakaâ€™s innovative way of identifying an independent â€˜silk routeâ€™ to the global market. With liberalisation being the mantra of the era, the state government has decided to privatise 94 of its 118 sericulture farms to increase output of quality silk and related products.

â€œWe are offloading our burden as the farms lack maintenance, staff and infrastructure. If they are handed over to a private agency, the silk output may increase,â€™â€™ sericulture secretary Ashok M. Dalwai told â€˜The Times of Indiaâ€™. Annual silk production in the nation is 15,000 metric tonnes (MT), of which Karnataka accounts for 70 per cent (10,500 MT).

But a staff crunch â€” of the required 15,000 staff, only 5,000 are presently working â€” has hit the state sericulture farms, where silkworm and cocoon rearing, seed production, mulberry plant breeding and distribution of saplings are undertaken. Infrastructure is in a sad state, with inadequate water supply and near-nonexistent fencing. By privatising the farms, the government expects to increase the output by 600 MT every year. The government has drawn up an action plan for privatisation of farms, whose total combined area is 2,000 hectares.

Two sectors of the industry â€” silk rearing and silk reeling â€” which are presently separate, will come under one roof. Consequently, big players are expected to to take over the farms. â€œWe can expect additional revenue. However, if a group of unemployed youths come forward with sufficient financial backing, they can also take possession of the farms,â€™â€™ Dalwai said. The government can commence privatisation of farms only after the Karnataka Silkworm Seed Cocoon and Silk Yarn (Regulation of Production, Supply, Distribution and Sale) Act, 1959, is amended.

This Act, which was enacted to protect the interests of sericulture farmers, growers and reelers of the state, prevents private sericulture-related activities. â€œWe have already proposed an amendment. It is pending with the law department,â€™â€™ Dalwai said. A large part of the land to be privatised is owned by the revenue department, whose consent is being sought.

The government will retain only 24 farms and convert them into â€˜modelâ€™ ones. â€œAt present, all our farms are meant for demonstration of sericulture practices to farmers. The status quo will be maintained. But the facilities will be improved,â€™â€™ Dalwai added.

9,Senior citizens' policy launched,"PATNA: Union information and broadcasting minister Ravishankar Prasad here on Monday distributed policy bonds to the people investing in the Varishtha Pension Bima Yojana, a scheme launched simultaneously at six places in the country, inclu-ding Patna, after its inauguration by Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee in Delhi.

The Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) of India is operating this scheme which is subsidised by the Union government as a measure of social security for senior citizens. The scheme is open to the people aged 55 years or more. Under the scheme, savings in the form of single premium is to be invested by a policy holder for a monthly pension varying from Rs 250 to Rs 2,000 according to the quantum of investment.

On the demise of the policy holder, the entire premium would be returned to their family members. The LIC is collaborating with the General Insurance Public Sector Association in this scheme. The launching of the scheme was done through video-conferencing from Delhi where the Prime Minister inaugurated it with Union finance minister Jaswant Singh and Union health minister Sushma Swaraj describing the benefits of the scheme.

The video-conferencing of the inaugural function was done simultaneously in Delhi, Bangalore, Gandhinagar, Mumbai, Hyderabad and Patna. Speaking on the occasion, Prasad said Doordarshan and All India Radio have a special role to play in popularising the Varishtha Pension Bima Yojana in the state, particularly among the rural people. Another scheme for old people announced by the PM through video-conferencing is the Universal Health Scheme which is to be launched in near future.

This scheme envisages geriatric clinics where senior citizens would be treated free for all health problems after their having come under its health insurance cover. The Union government is offering subsidy for these welfare insurance schemes, he added. Prasad said the two insurance schemes taken together would give a new direction to the social security system in the country.

10,B Tech colleges flout placement rule,"HYDERABAD: With nearly 225 engineering colleges in state from which more than 45,000 engineers graduate every year, one problem that these colleges face is job placements for its students. Most of these colleges, therefore, flout the rule of setting up a job placement cells in their campuses.

Even if some colleges have placement cells, very few actually conduct campus interviews for its students, according to a senior official in the technical education department.

As per All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE), every institute should have a training and placement cell headed by an officer of the cadre of professor, who should be responsible for developing links between the colleges and corporate bodies.

The officer should evaluate the job potential of the students passing from different branches of engineering and arrange for in-campus interviews and in-plant training. If the colleges cannot find a full time professor, the norm suggests that the management appoint one of the heads of the departments as placement officer.

The state has been producing a minimum of 45,000 engineering graduates every year in the last few years, and job opportunities for them has been on the decline, K Srinivasa Rao, an engineering student, said. The state has already reached its plan target of 50 engineering graduates per one lakh students, he said. Further, more than 90 per cent of these colleges have no standard libraries, according to sources.

Also, when the state council of higher education decided to take up academic audit and grading of engineering colleges to help students select a college of their choice to pursue their studies based on the grading, not even 15 per cent of the 225 engineering colleges in the state opted for grading, the sources said.

The government should make mandatory that all the engineering colleges be graded based on the infrastructure, faculty, campus interviews, libraries, teaching methodology and other parameters to enhance the standard of education, the student observed.

11,Man arrested for making obscene calls,"NEW DELHI: A man was arrested by the police on Saturday for making obsence calls to none other than the women personnel on duty in the Police Control Room (PCR). According to the police the accused, Rakesh (40) made atleast seven calls at the PCR number within a span of three days last week.

The accused, reportedly a trader of Khari Baoli, was nabbed while he was trying to make yet another call from a local phone booth at the Old Delhi railway station. A senior officer said: â€˜â€˜He appears to be a frustrated man. He abandoned his business two months back, though his brothers still trade in grocery items in Khari Baoli.â€™â€™

12,Noida's peacock poacher arrested,"NOIDA: The man behind the recent large-scale peacock deaths was arrested by the police on Sunday morning from the Bisrakh village area. According to the police, the accused Suresh Kumar (26) is a â€˜â€˜peacock meat addict.â€™â€™ About 20 peacocks and peahens were found dead within a span of just six days, earlier this month.

14,Third party mediation not needed: Fazlur Rehman,"WAGAH: Leader of Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, Maulana Fazlur Rehman, said on Tuesday that India and Pakistan should resolve their problems through bilateral talks and there was no need for third party intervention.

``We firmly believe that both India and Pakistan would solve their problems through bilateral talks and there was no need for the intervention of any third party, including the US,'''' said Rehman, adding that war was no option to a permanent peace in the region.

Rehman is leading a four-member parliamentarian delegation of Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam to India. They have arrived here on Tuesday through the Wagah border.

The delegation is on an unofficial diplomatic mission to further the cause of friendship with a hope that the ""improving relations between the two countries continues to improve"".

Speaking to media persons, Rehman said that the delegates are keen to meet the MPs, journalists and heads of religious and social organisations.

Rehman said that they have laid the foundation of the ``Ulema diplomacy,'''' claiming that MMA was the representative of people of Pakistan.

Rehman, however, chose to be quiet on the Kashmir issue. ``We should avoid disputed issues for now and should concentrate to work for peace and ensure that the peace process between two countries was not sabotaged by anyone,'''' said he.

Meanwhile, Madni told that there was no doubt that all of them (Pakistani parliamentarians) were politicians but at the same time they were religious heads in their personal capacity. He said that the delegation would be visiting the Golden Temple and would be meeting Jathedar of Akal Takht, Giani Joginder Singh Vedanti.

Commenting on the visit of Pak parliamentarians some time back, Madani alleged that they didn''t have the ``mass base'''' and couldn''t bring about ``people-to-people'''' contact between the two countries as was desired. ``Contentious issues should be cast aside on the path of peace,'''' Madni declared.

Besides Fazlur Rehman, the MAM delegation included Hafiz Hussain Ahmad, Senator Gul Naseeb Khan and Qazi Hamedullah. They have come to India on an invitation of Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam, Hind chapter, and were received by its general secretary Maulana Mehmood Madni at the Wagah border. The delegates are likely to return to Pakistan by July 20.

15,Piqued chief minister offers to step down,"MUMBAI: Chief Minister Sushilkumar Shinde has set the cat among the pigeons by threatening to quit from office. With Congress MLAs breathing down his neck at the meeting of the Democratic Front (DF) constituents on Tuesday, complaining about the â€œgovernment''s inaction'''' on several issues, Shinde said he had no great fancy for the CM''s office and offered to step down.

Shinde said he had accepted the responsibility on the instructions of Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that he was willing to put in his papers if party MLAs were dissatisfied with his performance.

Tempers ran high at the meeting of the DF constituents at Vidhan Bhavan when Congress MLA Amar Kale lamented that the state administration was doing precious little to resolve a litany of issues in his constituency.

Kale is the son of former minister and Congress loyalist Sharad Kale and represents Arvi assembly segment in Wardha district. Significantly, he is the nephew of MPCC president Ranjit Deshmukh.

Kale stirred the hornets nest when he sat on a one-day dharna at the Vidhan Bhavan steps on Monday. This was seen as a first unabashedly major public display of the party''s ire against the chief minister.

``Shinde has been away from Maharashtra for 12 years. He is still to come to terms with the situations that the MLAs have to face in their constituencies. If the MLA fails to deliver, it is his job which is at stake,'''' a Congress activist observed.

A Congress MLC Hussein Dalwai accused the government of failing to check atrocities on Dalits and Muslims. He was supported by Congress MLA Umaji Sanmadikar and RPI legislator Jogendra Kavade.

The legislators are worried about the political fallout of attacks on dalits and minorities.

Shinde wondered if the increasing attacks is the result of his elevation to the CM''s post.

Shinde is the first Dalit CM of Maharashtra. All the same, he made it clear that if partymen continued with their attacks on his ministerial team he would prefer to call it a day.

17,HC admits plea over development backlog in state,"NAGPUR: A high court bench here has admitted a petition seeking enforcement of the state governorâ€™s directive regarding equitable distribution of funds for the removal of development backlog, while fixing July 30 for final hearing.

A division bench, consisting of Justice Rajan Kochar and Justice S.T. Kharche, while admitting the petition on Monday, issued notices to the respondents.

The court was informed that the advocate general would appear before the bench on behalf of the state government. During a brief hearing, the bench sought to know what the petitioners were doing for the region when they were in power. The counsel for petitioner replied that the governorâ€™s directives were issued on December 15, 2000 and March 12, 2003, when the peitioners were not in power.

Petitioners B.T. Deshmukh (MLC), opposition leader in state legislative council Nitin Gadkari, Shiv Sena leader Diwakar Raote, Dnyaneshwar Dhane Patil and Davendra Phadanvis, (both MLAs), have accused the state government of ""brazen violation of legally binding directives of the governor issued on these dates.""

The petitioners also questioned the legality of proceedings of the house during a special session of the Maharshtra assembly in May and urged the high court to declare it constitutionally bad and illegal.

The petitioners also demanded convening of another session to reconsider recommendations of the upper house on the appropriation bill.

18,'Mill land policy loaded in favour of owners',"MUMBAI: Government officials admit that the 2001 mill policy, which lays down rules on commercial redevelopment of mill lands in the city, is ""loaded in favour of the mill owners.""

But they claim it is the ""best possible compromise,"" given conflicting demands from unpaid mill workers, city architects and owners. Like the earlier policy, the 2001 guidelines stipulates that when surplus land is sold, it must be divided by threeâ€”one- third for owners and the rest for the city for low-income housing and open spaces.

However, civic observers and architects only recently learnt about ''loopholes'' in the new policy which allow the owners to retain most of the land, when they scrutinised a National Textile Corporation proposal for redeveloping 261 acres. The proposals took advantage of clauses which say the tripartite division of land is only applicable to open lands, and not those areas which are already covered with buildings. In many mills, vacant lands is only a fraction of the total area.

While experts say this provision is letting the mill owners benefit at the expense of the city, state government officials argue that unless owners get the bulk of the profit they would never give up their land. They say that while mill owners were first offered the option of selling or developing their surplus land as far back as 1991, the one-third rule ensured that they simply sat tight through the 90s, refusing to either sell their plots or revive their sick mills.

""From 1999 to 2001, the mills were not revived and neither was there alternate commercial development. At least now, the mill areas of Parel are becoming more vibrant,"" says a senior bureaucrat, referring to the burgeoning of shops, restaurants, offices and clubs in the mill premises in the area. He reasons that although the city will get much less in terms of public spaces, the workers get much more.

""There are nine new provisions which take care of mill workers,"" he says, adding, ""There has to be a trade-off when so many interests are colliding. We have to keep everyone happy."" Proceeds from the sales are supposed to go into an escrow account to pay off the workers'' dues and debts.

""The less land the owners have to sell, the less the workers will get,"" says Ramanand Tiwari, principal secretary, state urban development department. The policy provides for owners to receive tranfer development rights in compensation for the land they are giving away but Mr Tiwari says that given the low market value of these rights, owners would rather keep the land.

However, critics say that giving owners a free hand does not guarantee that workers will get their money. In Matulya mills, for example, Rs 20 crore is due to workers, and Rs 88 crore was raised from commercial development but only a small portion has been deposited in the fund.

Similarly, the Standard and New China Mill spread over 12.35 acres, has developed office complexes in its land in Prabhadevi, but crores of rupees are still owed to its 3,600 workers. In fact, delay in paying workers'' dues was one of the main reasons that the state government last November announced that it would take over sick mills.

At that time, the then chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh had said that over Rs 500 crore was owed to over 22,000 workers, and that no more development would be allowed till the issue was settled.

19,Smoke incident in Borivli local to be probed,"MUMBAI: Commissioner of railway safety Prashant Kumar will probe Monday''s incident in which five women jumped out of a Borivli-bound local train at Goregaon station after seeing smoke emanating from a plastic bag in their coach.

Mr Kumar will record statements of railway officials and passengers on Thursday. He has inspected the second-class coach at the railway yard in Borivli.

The coach has, however, not been damaged. The police said the plastic bag contained three steel cylinders. While one of them contained ''gulab jamuns'', the rest were empty.

However, the inside portion of one of the cylinder had turned black, fuelling suspicion that the containers may have contained more than just ''gulab jamuns''.

Railway sources said that container may have contained an inflammable material though the police dismiss this theory. The police have also taken samples from the cylinders for forensic tests.

20,"Maya's rally a failure, say four Punjab ministers","CHANDIGARH: Four senior Punjab ministers have described Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mayawati''s rally here on Tuesday as a ""complete and utter failure.

In a joint statement issued here four ministers Chaudhary Jagjit Singh, Santokh Singh, Sardool Singh and Mohinder Singh Kay Pee said that the failure of the state Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) leadership to mobilise the promised crowd of one lakh people from Punjab has exposed that the party has no mass base.

Interestingly, the Congress has selected four Dalit ministers to challenge Mayawati suggesting that the Congress had given prominent slots to the Dalit legislators and they were the natural leaders of the Dalits of Punjab and not BSP or Mayawati.

To substantiate that the rally was a failure, these ministers said that Mayawati''s arrival at the rally had to be delayed for more than three hours to ensure there were sufficient number of people gathered there. They alleged that the BSP leaders were thus forced to pay people from the cityâ€™s labour colonies to make up numbers at the rally.

The ministers said the refusal of Punjab''s self-respecting Dalits to respond to leaders like Mayawati has been a major snub to the BSP and its immoral design of trying to ignite caste differences in Punjab. They pointed out that Mayawati and her colleagues had earlier also tried to instigate caste violence but this had been successfully pre-empted by the Punjab Government, which they claimed was sincerely committed to maintaining the peace at all costs.

Lambasting Mayawati for her unwarranted interference in Punjab politics, they said that it would eventually mark the end of the BSP''s already waning influence in Uttar Pradesh and other states. They said earlier the people of Punjab had rejected the BSP president Kanshi Ram and Mayawati too would meet the same fate.

These ministers warned Mayawati to keep her hands off Punjab if she wished to continue in any sort of active politics. They warned that her rejection from her mentor Kanshi Ram''s home state would have a cascading effect on the BSP which was fast losing its support base in Dalit communities all over the country.
