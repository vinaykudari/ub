Illyas'' counsel R K Jain argued before an SC Bench that the CBI had been framing him in different cases though the allegations and evidence were the same for all the FIRs.

As the period of 90 days, during which the chargesheet must be filed failing which an accused is entitled to bail, ended, the CBI would register a fresh case against him, counsel added.Despite the apex court''s order that Illiyas'' plea for bail be considered by the high court if he was apprehended in different cases based on the same evidence and material, the Patna High Court had rejected his plea for bail without looking into the SC''s order, Jain added.

On this, a Bench of Justices M B Shah and Arun Kumar fixed March 31 to hear the CBI''s arguments.

2,Lake silt will be given to farmers,"BANGALORE: The BCC will distribute the silt removed from Ulsoor lake among farmers. Studies conducted by IISc and University of Agricultural Sciences have shown that the silt scrapped out of the 200-year-old Ulsoor lake bed is estimated to be three times richer than any organic manure.

Also, the silt has a very high content of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium and is free from pathogens and toxins.

3,Hospitals junk hi-tech equipment,"BANGALORE: Laser treatment equipment worth Rs 35 lakh purchased two years ago by the urology department of Victoria Hospital lies unused. â€œIt has not been used for work worth even Rs 35. No one knows how to operate it,â€™â€™ say doctors at the hospital.

The same hospital purchased half a dozen â€˜state-of-the-artâ€™ ventilators, worth around Rs 4 lakh each, a couple of years ago. Doctors labelled them â€˜death trapsâ€™ and refused to use them. They now gather dust.

At Bowring Hospital, all equipment needed for a blood bank to begin operations has been in place for several months now, but for want of technicians, the blood bank is yet to take off.

While Health Minister Kagodu Thimmappa has lamented the wastage of medical equipment at primary health centres, the story is the same in other government hospitals.

An average of around Rs 18 crore â€” from state, central and foreign funds â€” is spent on medical equipment and machinery in Karnataka every year, but a large portion ends up junked and unused. Reason: corruption, slow procurement methods and plain indifference.

â€œThose involved in the procurement process â€” from the hospital staff to those in the ministry â€” are not bothered about quality. They only want their cut from the supplier. Finally, all kinds of equipment arrive at highly inflated costs,â€™â€™ says a senior doctor at Victoria Hospital.

A supplier of surgical equipment confirms he is often forced to sell equipment at twice the market price or push inferior quality to make up for bribes he pays along the way.

The time lag between the request for equipment and final supply also results in wastage. The gap â€” sometimes lasting three years â€” leads to the equipment becoming obsolete.

The state spends almost as much as some hi-tech hospitals but the equipment is seldom used, says a government doctor.

According to Dr L. Chandramma, Medical Superintendent at Bowring Hospital, the modern blood bank planned at the hospital has failed to take off for want of technicians.

Victoria Hospital superintendent N. Rajanna denies there is any wastage at his hospital. â€œIt was all in the past,â€™â€™ he says.

Minister Thimmappa, however, acknowledges that the government is bleeding from all sides. â€œA 10-man team has been sent to check out unused equipment at primary health centres.â€�

Whether something comes out of it or it will be an empty exercise remains to be seen.

4,MIM irked by minister's attitude,"HYDERABAD: The MIM has registered its protest in the Assembly against the attitude of school education minister M Venkateshwara Rao in not giving proper assurance with regard to reservation to minorities in appointment of teacher posts and special allocations under primary education for Muslims.

Making a statement regarding low literacy and education level among the minorities Venkateswara said that the government had increased Urdu medium schools from 1,311 to 2,364 and as many as 2,356 posts in Urdu medium schools had been filled up in the last two years. Currently, 1,654 posts are being filled up in addition to the 912 Urdu medium Vidya Volunteers engaged.

Rao asserted that the government had no intention to interfere in the administrative affairs of minority institutions. The minister made a statement in response to a notice given by MIM members Asaduddin Owaisi, Akbaruddin Owaisi, Congress members N Raghuveera Reddy, Younis Sultan and others under Rule 304 on the issue.

Earlier, Asaduddin Owaisi and Akbaruddin Owaisi criticised the government for allocating only Rs 1.5 crore for minority welfare and Rs 90 lakh for scholarships. They came down on the government for not filling up as many as 900 Urdu teacher posts.

Congress member Younis Sultan and CPM leader Nomula Narasimhaiah alleged that the government was ignoring the Muslim minorities and the minority community schools without undertaking any repairs though they were in a dilapidated condition.

5,Goodwill home never sought govt licence,"HYDERABAD: The Goodwill Childrenâ€™s Village Home which hit the headlines after the alleged sexual abuse of a minor girl at the hands of the Home founder, Rajasekhar Babu, had never applied for recognition from the directorate of women and child welfare.

Sources said that in April, 2001, the government issued an order stating that all voluntary organisations which work for the betterment of women or children must register with the directorate.

â€œWe never received any application from Goodwill Childrenâ€™s Village Home,â€� an officer said. The directorate has already sent a note to the government stating that it had not recognised the Home, the officer said. The order was issued following allegations of irregularities in the functioning of many such organisations. The directorate had issued advertisements in newspapers warning NGOs that those of them that do not apply for recognition would have to close down. â€œIf such organisations donâ€™t respond now, we will soon start taking action,â€� the officer said. Recognition is granted to NGOs only after it submits registration papers apart from a clearance from the local police station. Most organisations which have a dubious record thrive on private funds and do not register. â€œThey decide to forego government grants as they do not want to figure in any of our records,â€� the officer said.

â€œThese organisations are funded by miscellaneous trusts, many of which are based abroad.We are supposed to coordinate only with institutions which use government grants and not empowered to deal with private funds. So, these organisations raise funds from whomever they choose to, after presenting fabricated documents about their projects to the sponsors,â€� he said.

Illiyas had surrendered before the court which had issued nob-bailable warrants against him in Rs 25-crore scam cases during 1994-96.

The CBI alleged that he had ordered huge quantity of bitumen without having assessed the requirement needed for the construction of roads.

7,SC notice to MP govt on eunuch's petition,"NEW DELHI: The fate of the country''s first eunuch mayor of Katni, Kamala Jaan, who was disqualified by the Madhya Pradesh High Court for contesting from a seat reserved for women, would be decided by the Supreme Court.

A Bench of Justices Brijesh Kumar and S B Sinha on Monday issued notices to the Madhya Pradesh government and the state election commission after hearing arguments by Jaan''s counsel Prashanto Sen and P Shandilya.

Counsel said that she had registered herself as a woman in the voters'' list and hence was entitled to contest from a seat reserved for women candidates.

The High Court had on February 3 upheld an election tribunal order setting aside Jaan''s election from a seat reserved for women. The tribunal had invalidated her election on August 29, 2002.

Upholding the tribunal''s order, the high court had held that the eunuch mayor was a ""male"" and, therefore, not entitled to contest a seat reserved for women. Jaan had won the election for the mayor''s post defeating BJP''s Alka Jain and others.

In her petition, Jaan said that the state election commission had directed that eunuchs could register themselves as either male or female voters during the preparation of the voters'' list.

Jaan said that since she had registered herself as a female voter, she was entitled to contest the election to a seat reserved for women.

8,Declare India Hindu nation: VHP tells govt,"NEW DELHI: Declaring that it was on the path of confrontation with the Vajpayee government over the Ram Temple issue, VHP has said it was not concerned about the government''s stability and demanded amendment in the Constitution for declaring India as a Hindu nation.

Firebrand VHP general secretary Praveen Togadia has said that the only legal solution to the Ramjanambhoomi dispute was a central legislation declaring it as a birth place of Sri Ram and hand it over to sants.

Dismissing as non-serious Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Digvijay Singh''s support for cow slaughter, Togadia suggested that if Singh really wanted the ban, he should ask party president Sonia Gandhi to support the move in Parliament.

""I think we stand for Hindutva and not for government... If Hindutva and the government are complimentary, then it is fine... We have decided to go for Ram rather than Raj,"" he said in an interview to the latest edition of RSS mouthpiece Organiser.

""Of course we are confronting, without mobilising public opinion and democratic agitations how is it possible that any government would accept our agenda,"" he asked.

Togadia asserted that the fight was not confined to government alone. ""Of course, this is a fight against government administratively, secularists academically and jehadi forces locally and globally,"" he said.

Referring to the government''s ""compulsion"", he asked ""are we here for the stability of the government or are we here to fulfil the aspirations of Hindu society?""

""If we are working for Ram temple, Hindu Rashtra and fulfilment of aspirations of the Hindu society, we should create awareness no matter if it creates any hurdles for government, including the NDA government,"" Togadia said.

Maintaining that India was a ''Hindu Rashtra'' since millenniums, the VHP leader said ""we are now demanding the restoration of the glory"" of that.

""It is a question of acknowledgement. We say, India is a Hindu Rashtra, but not everyone realises this. There is need to acknowledge it,"" he said, adding ""we have asked for the ''pranpratishtha'' (consecration) of Hindu Rashtra.""

Stating that ""something"" has to be done by the government also, Togadia said ""there is a need to amend the Constitution for this purpose.""

Pointing out that Rajiv Gandhi had allowed laying of foundation stone for the Ram temple in Ayodhya, Narasimha Rao allowed reconstruction of small makeshift temple at the ""birthplace"" after demolition of the ""disputed"" structure, he questioned ""then why this government cannot consider our demands?

""If Rajiv Gandhi and Narasimha Rao can concede to the demands of saints, why cannot Atal Bihari Vajpayee respect the sentiments of Hindus?""

Referring to the recently-held Dharam Sansad in Delhi, the VHP leader said the ""first achievement"" of the conclave was that ""we have repeated the 1990s as far as active mobilisation of sadhus and saints is concerned.""

9,Naik to push for incentives to LNG,"NEW DELHI: With Budget '03-04 failing to live up to the expectations of oil sector, Petroleum Minister Ram Naik will separately plead for fiscal incentives including duty cut and infrastructure status for Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) imports. ""We will continue to hold dialogue (with Finance Ministry) for fiscal incentives for LNG to make it competitive with domestically produced natural gas,"" Naik told reporters here. The Budget had only half-heartedly reduced customs duty on capital goods for LNG plants from 25 per cent to 5 per cent and larger demands like zero duty on LNG and infrastructure status for LNG projects did not find mention in the Budget. ""It is more important that customs duty on LNG be brought to nil (from current 5 per cent) so as to make it cheaper,"" he said. The duty relief provided in the Budget would only reduce the delivered cost of LNG by just 10 cents per million BTU (British Thermal Unit) and customs duty cut was needed to bring it down to around 3 dollars per million BTU. Petroleum Ministry had earlier moved a Cabinet note on Integrated LNG Policy but a decision was deferred as the Budget was expected to contain most of the fiscal incentives. ""We would also seek declared goods status for LNG so as to attract only 4 per cent sales tax as against present scenario of highs of 24 per cent,"" Naik said. LNG is costlier as the gas is first liquefied then transported through ships and has to be again re-gassified at the import country.

11,India's satellite broadcast equipment market to soar: PWC,"BANGALORE: The market for satellite broadcast equipment in India is expected to grow almost five times to about 110,000 units in the next five years, a recent report by PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PWC) said.

The growth will be driven by new applications such as distance education, internet, rural connectivity, banking and finance and gaming industry, the report on the VSAT industry by PWC, conducted for the fiscal 2001-02, said.

""Over the last year, the industry had benefited greatly from increased adoption of IT by non-IT companies, favourable regulations and overall macro-economic business confidence.

12,UP by-election result worries Congress,"NEW DELHI: The Congress might have more to worry about than just having lost another Assembly seat in Uttar Pradesh. It is a round lost to the UP heavyweight in the ongoing Mayawati versus Priyanka Vadra bout, on the Gandhi familyâ€™s home turf.

The party lost its Gauriganj seat to the BSP last week - a by-election victory that UP chief minister Mayawati will savour with personal satisfaction. The result was dismissed lightly by the Congress in the aftermath of the spectacular Himachal Pradesh win. But Gauriganj is one of the assembly segments in Amethi, Congress president Sonia Gandhiâ€™s Lok Sabha seat.

It was in Amethi that Priyanka recently took on Mayawati, challenging her where it hurt most â€“ the Dalit constituency. Priyanka suddenly descended upon Amethi late last year, visiting peopleâ€™s homes and adopting the cause of a Dalit, Shambhu Nath, who alleged he had been rendered homeless by an upper caste person.

That amid much hype and cheer for the UP Congressman who looks upon Priyanka as the last saviour of a state party unit sinking rapidly in a quagmire of wrong political moves.

It was reckoned that a political answer had finally been found in the winsome Priyanka to the resolute Bahujan Samaj Party steamroller that flattens anything in her way, allies included. In a typical knee-jerk reaction, a slighted Mayawati stirred a counter controversy by declaring Amethi a separate district and renaming it Shahuji Maharaj Nagar.

About 31 per cent of Amethiâ€™s voters are Dalits, a fact that Mayawati seemed to have in mind when she launched a blistering attack on the Congress, Sonia and Priyanka accusing them of misleading Dalits. ""Priyanka Gandhi came to camp here last month only as part of a Congress conspiracy to enact a drama to defame me,"" she said at a savdhaan (caution) rally, called in December specifically to undo the damage wrought by Priyanka.

Priyanka Gandhi had refused to comment on her sudden interest in Amethi â€“ her last visit had been during the election campaign for her mother in the Lok Sabha elections. But Mayawati took the battle further. She insisted on fighting the Gauriganj bye-election, refusing to yield the seat in a tie-up to the BJP.

Mayawati suggested that the BJP let her fight Gauriganj, now a prestige issue, and take her help in winning Haidergarh. The BJP did not agree.

Ultimately, the two coalition allies, the BSP and BJP, contested both the bye-elections in UP separately, with the BJP losing its stronghold Haidergarh to the Samajwadi Party.

But Mayawati got her revenge in Gauriganj, with her candidate Jung Bahadur winning by a 7,000-vote margin over Fateh Bahadur of the Congress. The victory is sweeter for the UP chief minister because she has wrested yet another Congress seat in the bargain. The bye-election in Gauriganj was necessitated by the death of the sitting Congress MLA.

Congressmen take umbrage at doubts being raised about Priyankaâ€™s popularity. Priyanka, they point out, did not campaign in Gauriganj, while Mayawati visited the region repeatedly and had a posse of 30 ministers campaigning. But in a place where Amethi ka danka, bitiya Priyanka (Amethiâ€™s clarion call is for daughter Priyanka) is the most oft heard election slogan, was the Gandhi scionâ€™s high-profile four-day visit just a few months ago not good enough to leave a lasting impression?

13,Withdraw support to NDA govt: SHSAD,"CHANDIGARH: The Sarb Hind Shi-romani Akali Dal has asked former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal to withdraw his party's support to the BJP-led NDA government in view of un-precedented burden put on farm-ers in the budget proposals. General secretary of the party Prem Singh Chandumajra said Badal's silence on the matter indi-cates that he was no more sympa-thetic to the cause of farmers. He criticised the Centre for cutting subsidies on fertilizers, pesticides and enhancing cost of diesel which, he alleged, would add to farmers' woes. Earlier, the party leaders pre-sented a memorandum to Punjab Governor Lt gen (retd) JFR Jacob, listing various demands includ-ing exemption for Sikh women from wearing helmet and holding early election to the general house of the SGPC. The delegation also demanded amnesty for DPS Bhullar convicted in the case of attack on former All India Youth Congress president Maninderjit Singh Bitta. Commenting on the perform-ance of the Amarinder govern-ment, Chandumajra said the SHSAD was disappointed with it. The government, he said, had failed to fulfil the expectations of the people as it had gone back on many of its promises made dur-ing the election including that of Rs 30 per quintal bonus for paddy growers and continuation of free power supply to farmers. Asked how would he compare the Congress government's per-formance to that of the SAD-BJP government, Chandumajra said both had failed to deliver goods. If Badal's government was ""khaan-walian di sarkar"", Amarinder was running ""peenwalian di sarkar"".

14,BJP to shun Hindutva in next polls: Mahajan,"PUNE: The construction of Ram temple at the disputed site in Ayodhya, introduction of a uniform civil code and an all-out embracement of Hindutva will not be on the Bharatiya Janata Partyâ€™s agenda for the 2004 Lok Sabha elections.

Speaking to reporters on Monday, BJP senior leader Pramod Mahajan, who was in the city to participate in a public rally organised as part of the Sangharsha Yatra, clarified that although the BJP firmly believed in all these issues, they will not form part of the electoral plank.

Mahajan said, â€œSince the BJP is committed to contesting the next LS elections under the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) coalition, we will have to contest the polls on a common agenda, and hence these issues might not figure in it.â€�

Elaborating, Mahajan said the party had decided to enter into a pre-poll pact with the NDA alliance partners.

â€œI am confident that the BJP will get a majority in the House. But, even then, we will request our alliance partners to share power,â€� he said.

He, however, said that the BJP was ready to pass a â€˜lawâ€™ through which the disputed site in Ayodhya could be handed over for temple construction, provided the main opposition Congress party supports the proposal.

â€œUnless the Congress supports this proposal or the court gives a ruling that the disputed site be given for temple construction, the government cannot do anything in this regard,â€� Mahajan said, referring to the Vishwa Hindu Parishadâ€™s criticism of the Vajpayee government.

Pointing out that quashing Article 370 would require a two-third majority in both the Houses of Parliament, Mahajan said that the chances of any single party getting two-third majority in the Rajya Sabha were bleak for the next 25 years. Stating that Hindutva was never a poll plank for the BJP, Mahajan said, â€œOur victory in Gujarat does not signify the victory of Hindutva, nor does our loss in Himachal Pradesh mean that Hindutva has been defeated. It is an ideology and it is not a poll plank for usâ€�.

Stating that the BJP had won the same number of votes in Himachal as it had in earlier elections, Mahajan felt that the partyâ€™s defeat in Himachal does not mean the people are against the partyâ€™s policies.

Stating that â€œModi patternâ€� was a term coined by the media, Mahajan said not a single â€œresponsible BJP leaderâ€� had ever said that the party will execute the â€œModi patternâ€� in the country. Mahajan refuted reports that he had favoured the Reliance company during his tenure as the Union telecom minister.

â€œIf anybody proves that I had favoured the company or for that matter any other company I will quit politics. The only favour I had done for Reliance was to release a postal stamp in memory of late Dhirubhai Ambani,â€� Mahajan said.

The police will wait for Mr Singh to return to his Mulund home, a police officer said, adding, â€œIf he does not do so, we will send a team to arrest him.â€™â€™

The move is a bid by MSEB to try and regularise illegal connections, which have been a major drain on the electricity boardâ€™s resources.
