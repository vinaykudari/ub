1,BJP has problems in all 4 states going to polls,"NEW DELHI: The BJP wants to stay on the ""right side"" of the VHP and its leaders like Praveen Togadia, currently in jail for launching a trishul deeksha ceremony in Rajasthan in violation of a state government notification, but it is not placing its faith in Hindutva to win the state. Senior party sources said on Thursday that the caste factor in virtually every constituency in the state would override any attempt to ""unite"" Hindus on a common platform through distribution of trishuls or otherwise. Though the BJP considers Rajasthan as the simplest state to win, it is taking no chances. It is trying to consolidate its base among the state's Rajputs, Jats and Brahmins and stoke the anti-incumbency factor against Ashok Gehlot whom it believes is the weakest of the four Congress chief ministers it is hoping to oust from power in the Assembly elections later this year. The BJP's CM candidate, Vasundhara Raje, was chosen for her relative youth and lack of any baggage in the hope that these qualities would go down well with the electorate. The problem is it hasn't gone down so well with the state unit. So far, she had confined herself to her parliamentary constituency of Jhalawar and now she has been asked to tour every Assembly constituency in a rath. The second easiest state, the BJP feels, is Madhya Pradesh, which CM candidate Uma Bharati is also touring in a rath. Poor roads, lack of power and water haunts the 10-year-old Digvijay Singh government, but the BJP state unit remains deeply divided. Recently, the group opposed to Uma, headed by state chief Kailash Joshi, met at Union minister Vikram Verma's residence in Delhi. The party leadership's creation of an anomaly in retaining Joshi as state chief while projecting Uma as its CM candidate has led to a rift. This is also the case in Chhattisgarh, the second most difficult state, admits a senior BJP leader. The party made Union minister Raman Singh quit to become state chief, but realised later that party MP Dilip Singh Judeo, known for his zeal for ""re-conversion"", provided the Hindu muscularity needed to counter CM Ajit Jogi. The BJP also hopes to tie up with the NCP in the state, recently strengthened by the entry of veteran Congressman V C Shukla. In Delhi, regarded as the toughest state by the BJP, the leadership is currently engaged in assuaging state unit chief Madanlal Khurana's feelings. He was upset to read reports that he was being replaced by Union Law Minister Arun Jaitley. ""Khuranaji is still in neutral gear,"" said a senior BJP leader. ""We need to get his car on the road first."" The other major problem is that though the Capital's demographic picture has changed with the influx from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Uttaranchal, the BJP is seen primarily as a Punjabi party, still living in a post-partition warp. The BJP hopes to correct this through campaigners from these states.

2,BJP think-tank unhappy with govt stance on Iraq,"NEW DELHI: The BJP's intellectual cell felt the Vajpayee government should not have permitted the all-party resolution on Iraq which had ""deplored"" the unilateral action by US and British forces against Iraq, sources said. In an interaction with Foreign Minister Yashwant Sinha on Wednesday at the party headquarters, many members of the cell questioned both the timing - which came virtually towards the end of the war - as well as the wording of the resolution, which actually named the US. Sources said that cell members pointed out that pragmatism dictated that India remained on the right side of the US, particularly so that it could get a share of the post-conflict Iraq reconstruction pie. Sinha, on his part, drew the attention of the cell members to India's compulsions in taking the middle of the road stand. Chief among them, he claimed, was the fact that 12 per cent of India's population was Muslim. Sinha reportedly said that it was fortunate that there had been no uprising thus far, but this was something that had to be factored into any stand the government took on Iraq. Opinion polls have shown that the overwhelming majority of Indians, and not just Muslims, oppose the US war on Iraq. Questions on whether the Iraq conflict would impact on India's approach to Pakistan were raised. Sinha reportedly said that India should not be deterred by the threats being made and that it was high time India called the Pakistani bluff on the nuclear issue. It was, however, not clear what precisely the minister was hinting at, or whether it was simply rhetoric to keep the intellectual cell in good humour.

3,Colleges & govt stick to their seats,"BANGALORE: There is no word of cheer for CET candidates with both the state government and college managements sticking to their guns in the final round of talks held today to resolve the professional colleges admissions issue. The talks collapsed, riddling the studentsâ€™ future with difficult posers.

The government stuck to its demand of 50 per cent of medical and dental seats, while private college managements refused to part with more than 25 per cent seats. The managements said they will challenge any GO contrary to their offer while the cabinet subcommittee headed by D.B. Chandre Gowda decided to refer the issue back to the cabinet on April 22. Karnataka State Private Medical and Dental Collegesâ€™ Association president Shamanur Shivashankrappa said the impasse continued as the government''s proposal was not acceptable.

Congress MP R.L. Jalappa, who runs the Devaraj Urs Medical College in Kolar, ruled out another round of talks as the managements could not give more than 25 per cent seats. ""The talks weren''t successful but the doors for discussion aren''t closed (either). These developments would be placed before the cabinet and its decision will be the government''s"".

Gowda said contrary to the perception that the engineering admission issue has been resolved, latest developments have proved otherwise. The Centreâ€™s extraordinary gazette notification about AICTE stipulating 85:15 seat-sharing between the managements and the government and the proposed fee structure is also not acceptable to the managements, he added. ""We want to protect the interest of socially backward and oppressed classes, which we sought 50 per cent of seats. On this count, the talks failed"", he said. On the managements'' threat to challenge the governmentâ€™s decision in the court, Gowda said any individual was free to approach the court.

However, the government could take action under the Prevention of the Capitation Fee Act and the Karnataka Education Act. ""The Supreme Court order does not supersede these laws which are still alive"". Water resources minister H.K. Patil said the government wanted the managements to maintain the aspect of social responsibility in admissions. ""We asked the managements to continue to give the government 50 per cent seats prevalent so far. But they refused"", higher education minister G. Parameshwara said. Congress MLC Prabhakar Kore, who runs the KLE Society, Belgaum, said: ""The government can take away our seats but pay us the recurring expenditure of 2.72 lakh for each seat. Anyway, we are providing a capital expenditure of Rs 60 crore for students, which is our social commitment"".

On Thursday, several RJD workers were seen monitoring the preparation of the construction of a concrete stage on the northern part of the Gandhi Maidan. Several construction workers were busy preparing the stage at the Gandhi, Maidan, the venue of the rally.

Earlier in the day, hundreds of RJD workers organised a special â€œLathi Tel Pilawanâ€� programme at the party headquarters here. The city is dotted with RJD hoarding located in different parts of the city. In some of the hoarding, RJD enthusiasts termed chief minister Rabri Devi as â€œRajmataâ€�.

While inaugurating a road construction at Daudbigha, Kumhrar, RJD supremo Laloo Prasad Yadav said that communalism is the greatest danger before the nation. Yadav called upon the people to attend the rally on April 30 to defeat the fascist forces in the country.

Making a scathing attack on the BJP, Yadav said that these leaders have no moral right to remain in power.

5,HC upholds govt order on teachers' payscales,"PATNA: The single bench of the Patna High Court, presided over by Justice Chandramauli Kumar Prasad on Thursday, while upholding the state government order that untrained teachers, irrespective of their qualifications, are not entitled to payscales of trained teachers, dismissed all the writ petitions (numbering over 165) filed by untrained teachers against this order of the government.

According to the prosecution, the government had taken a decision that all the appointment of school teachers will be made by the BPSC and as a result of which a large number of trained and untrained candidates qualified in both the written and oral tests and appointed in different schools.

Thereafter, the state government issued another circular making the highly qualified teachers entitled to the payscales of matric-trained teachers.

A third circular was issued by the state government to the effect that only trained teachers are entitled to the payscales of trained teachers and ordered for the recovery of excess payment made to untrained teachers in trained teachersâ€™ scale. A number of writ applications were filed by aggrieved teachers against this order of the government.

When the matter was brought before Justice Aftab Alam of the HC he allowed the writ applications, setting aside the state government order of recovery of excess payment made to untrained teachers. He also stated that only graduate teachers are entitled to the payscales of matric-trained teachers.

The state government and some undergraduate teachers too filed a letter patent appeals (LPAs) against the single bench judgement of Justice Alam.

A division bench presided over by Justice Nagendra Rai set aside the single bench judgement and remitted the case to another single bench presided over by Justice Chandramauli Kumar Prasad. Advocate Bipin Bihari Singh appeared for the petitioners.

6,Allahabad HC stays Amar Singh's arrest,"LUCKNOW: The Allahabad High Court on Thursday restrained till May 16 the police from arresting Samajwadi Party leader Amar Singh in connection with the case registered by the BSP on charges of forging CDs to put chief minister Mayawati in a bad light. The court gave the order on a petition filed for quashing the FIRs registered against him, SP supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav and other party leaders. The petition also sought a stay on the arrest of the persons named in the FIRs.

The FIR against Singh was registered at the Hazratganj police station in Lucknow by BSP state president KK Sachan in which he along with Yadav, and leader of opposition in the Vidhan Sabha Azam Khan and five others were charged with forcibly entering the BSP office and preparing forged electronic documents (CDs) and doctoring them.

A division Bench comprising Justice Vishnu Sahai and Justice Abdul Mateen, while staying the arrest of Singh, directed UP chief minister Mayawati, principal secretary (home) Pradeep Kumar, state government and the state BSP president Sachan to file their replies within four weeks and posted the matter for further hearing on May 16 next. Singh also apprehended that the persons named in the FIRs could be arrested anytime under pressure from Mayawati.

Stateâ€™s principal secretary (home) Pradeep Kumar, SHO Hazratganj and BSP state president Sachan have been made respondents in the petition. As many as 136 FIRs were registered against SP supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav and others pertaining to the misuse of discretionary funds during Yadavâ€™s stint as UP chief minister.

7,State govt yet to appoint doctors,"PATNA: The recommendations made by Bihar Public Service Commission (BPSC) more than two years back notwithstanding, the appointment of over 800 doctors hangs fire as the Bihar government is yet to take a final decision about it.

The health department had on February 24 this year constituted a three-member committee headed by additional health secretary C K Anil to identify vacant sanctioned posts of doctors in the state.

The director-in-chief, health services, Dr Anil Kumar, and deputy secretary, health, K K Agrawal, were the other two members of the committee. The committee is yet to submit its report though it had been asked to do so within 10 days. The committee had been told to take the matter seriously as the Patna High Court was seized of the matter.

The health department had on February 24 asked all civil surgeons to identify the number of vacant sanctioned posts of doctors under their respective jurisdiction and send their reports to the department latest by February 28. The department is, however, yet to receive reports from a majority of civil surgeons.

The civil surgeons had earlier reacted very slowly to the directives of chief secretary S N Biswas and health commissioner Ashok Kumar Chaudhary asking them to dismiss by February-end all those class III and class IV employees who had been allegedly appointed in an irregular manner since 1980, failing which the government had warned them of disciplinary action.

Despite repeated directives and warnings, the civil surgeons have so far dismissed only 843 employees though more than 2,000 persons were suspected to have been appointed in an unauthorised manner.

A senior health department official said that with the Jharkhand government refusing to appoint 271 doctors (one-third of the total recommendations) on the basis of the BPSC panel, the state government would now have to absorb all the 800 odd doctors.

The official, however, hastened to add that the chief minister had already directed the department to adjust 122 doctors earlier associated with post-partum (post-delivery care) programme. Sources in the health department said that there was no way the government could appoint more than 425 doctors.

Top sources on Wednesday said that the department was toying with the idea of appointing all the 800 odd doctors on contract provided the government approved of the proposal.

The department is yet to send a proposal to this effect to the government.

Health commissioner Chaudhary 16 refused to comment on the issue. But a top official obliquely confirmed such a move when he said, â€œI shall neither confirm nor deny it.â€�

8,Trucker's agitation spoils mango party,"BANGALORE: The bumper produce of mangoes has left a sour taste for traders and farmers this year. Unable to reach the king of fruits to the rest of the world, Asiaâ€™s biggest Mango mandi at Palace Grounds is suffering untold losses, thanks to the indefinite truckersâ€™ strike.

There are over 55 export companies at the mandi but business has come to a standstill. Even wooing local consumers with lesser price hasnâ€™t helped.

Traders,who expected over 10,000 tonnes of mangoes this year, have asked farmers not to carry out the initial harvest. â€œWe will wait and watch till Saturday. If the situation remains the same, traders will move stocks by train,â€� Tanveer Hussain, spokesperson of the mandi, said.

The existing stock at the mandi is only about 100 tonnes of mangoes. Says Toufiq Ahmed, a trader, â€˜Parts of Pune, Mumbai, Gujarat and many north Indian states, and West Asian countries are awaiting their daily consignment.

The trade which would have fetched Rs 20 crore will be hit by a couple of crores this year.â€� Thanks to the strike, a daily loss of Rs 15 lakh is being estimated just on Alphonso, a much sought-after variety across the world. â€œThe produce was expected to reach Mumbai where it would have been repacked for exports.

But, all this has been held back now,â€� they add. Alphonso and Badami prices have dropped from Rs 18 to Rs 15 per kilo locally. The cost of Raspuri has dipped from Rs 12 to Rs 8 per kilo and Lalbagh variety is being sold at Rs 6 instead of Rs 9.50 per kilo.

Farmers from Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh are suffering a weekâ€™s delay due to non-harvesting of the perishable fruit. Some farmers have already incurred losses up to Rs 2 lakh so far. â€œThe situation could be a nightmare if the weather plays spoilsport as the fruits might drop due to heavy rain and winds,â€� a farmer from Kolar lamented.

9,Warrant issued against state minister,"MUZAFFARPUR: The additional district and session judge I has issued a warrant against state secondary and higher education minister Ram Lakhan Ram Raman for not appearing in the court in a criminal case.

The minister represents Khajauli assembly seat in Madhubani district. According to official sources, Raman is one of the witnesses of a dacoity case in which the minister was himself relieved of properties worth lakh of rupees.

The minister was on way to his home district by bus along with his armed security guard on June 9, 1997, from Patna. Forty-eight other passengers had boarded the bus from the Hardinge Park in Patna.

When the bus arrived near Kebtasa under the Gayaghat police station, the armed road robbers stopped the bus at gunpoint and looted almost all passengers, including the minister.

The robbers had also snatched the service revolver of minister''s security guard Rajeshwar Singh. On March 2, 2002, the minister and his security guard were asked to appear in court.

But the minister could not turn up despite frequent reminders by the additional public prosecutor, said police sources.

Taking strong note of the minister''s failure in appearing at the court as a witness, the concerned court has issued warrant of against him and his security guard. The next date has been fixed by the court on April 28.

10,Court rejects Surendra plea to stay arrest,"GAYA: District and sessions judge Jawahar Lal Chaudhary on Thursday turned down the prayer of former minister Surendra Prasad Yadav to grant stay on his arrest in the sensational custodial kidnapping case.

The former minister is absconding since April 7. A non-bailable warrant of arrest has already been issued against him.

The prayer for staying his arrest was made by Yadav through his lawyer S D N Singh on Thursday morning.

Prior to that, S D N Singh prayed for the grant of anticipatory bail to Yadav. The district and sessions judge called for the case diary.

After that, the former ministerâ€™s lawyer made an oral submission for the grant of stay on the arrest of his high-profile client. The district judge instantly rejected the prayer.

According to court sources, in the anticipatory bail petition, the former minister has taken the stand that the FIR did not show his direct involvement in the offence in which Atul Prakash, a Patna case accused being brought from Gujarat and three police personnel were allegedly kidnapped, tortured and kept into wrongful confinement at his Gaya residence.

Another plea made by Surindra in the anticipatory bail petition is that the FIR itself has become of questionable credibility, as the SI Ramakant Ram, the complainant of the case, has himself been made an accused of the same case and subsequently sent to jail.

As such, the statement of one accused against another lacks legal credibility, says the petition.

Meanwhile, in its attempt to make a foolproof case against Surendra Yadav, the Gaya police have gathered evidence to prove the presence of Yadav in Gaya between April 4 and 6 when the alleged offence was committed.

Surendra Yadavâ€™s anticipatory bail petition will again come up for hearing on April 24, 2003.

11,Organisations reach out to aid students' development,"MUMBAI: In a powerful collaboration aimed at improving the quality of education, the Times Foundation, Women''s Movement for Peace and Prosperity and Manthan plan to reach out to state education officers and more than 400 principals from a cross-section of schools in south Mumbai in the coming week.

The collaboration hopes to enrich principals and education officers by sharing teaching modules that will empower students emotionally and spiritually.

The first session was held on Thursday. About 60 principals from schools situated in the ''A'' and ''B'' wards listened attentively to the talks on ''Skills for Adolescence'' and improving the emotional and spiritual quotient of students.

Similar sessions for school principals from eight other wards will be held between noon and 4 p.m. on April 21, 22, 23 and 24 at The Times of India office on D.N. Road.

Manthan has more than 500 principals of secondary and higher secondary schools working in tandem with state education officers to help improve education standards in the city.

Explaining the basis for collaborating with the Times Foundation, education inspector Basanti Roy, who founded Manthan, said, ""Our vision has a lot in common with that of Times Foundation. Instead of working in isolation, we chose to pool in our efforts to make a greater impact in revamping the education scenario.""

Times Foundation promotes equitable and sustainable social development and aims to raise collective consciousness by providing a forum for the government, NGOs, industry and citizens in which to interact.

This tripartite collaboration will have institutions like Sophia College and Nirmala Niketan sharing teaching modules on empowering students, especially the girl child.

Spiritual organisations will impart knowledge on value education and organisations like Lions Club International will talk about their awareness programmes to help parents and teachers tackle emotional problems and inculcate social values among adolescent children. The schools are free to adopt any of the modules in their curriculum.

According to Diana Marfatia, principal of BJPC Institute at Charni Road, such collaborative efforts will help liberate education from the confines of a structured curriculum.

""Value-added education is necessary for the all-round development of students,"" she said after attending the session on Thursday.

12,BDA survey not to blame for farmer's death: Cops,"BANGALORE: The death of a farmer in the Kempapura-Dasarahalli area, which witnessed violence on Tuesday, has taken a new turn. Acquisition of his land by the BDA was not the reason for suicide.

The post-mortem report indicates that Ashok Kumar, the farmer, killed himself on Monday night and not on Tuesday, as it was said earlier. ""Vested interests have given a new twist to Ashokâ€™s death by blaming BDA surveyors"", the police said.

On Tuesday, villagers of Dasarahalli told the police that Ashok killed himself after two BDA surveyors went to him for acquiring his land. His death had triggered violence in the area. ""But the post-mortem clearly indicates Ashokâ€™s death took place on Monday night. A leader of a Kannada organisation, who had organised a protest in front of BDA office a month ago against acquisition of land for forming Arkavathy Layout, is behind the entire drama"", the police said.

The leader is trying to protect the interest of land sharks and he used Ashok''s death to his advantage and malign the BDA, they added. ""We are on the lookout for him. The same person had masterminded the attack on AIADMK MLA Bhaktavatsalam in the city during recent Cauvery agitation"", said a senior police officer.

14,BJP welcomes govt's decision on Paragodu reservoir,"HYDERABAD: The BJP has welcomed the governmentâ€™s decision to approach Supreme Court on the Karnataka governmentâ€™s move to construct a reservoir across the Chitravathi river at Paragodu village in Bagepalli taluk of Kolar district.

Addressing a press conference on Thursday, party state vice-president S V Seshagiri said that the construction of the reservoir would dry up more than 60 irrigation tanks Anantapur district. Moreover, it violated Madras presidency agreement, he added.

BJP state general secretary K Laxman asked the government to convene an all-party meeting on the fee structure for engineering courses. The government should ask the SC to review recent verdict on unaided colleges, he said.

Laxman said that the government should rational while finalising the fee structure should keep in mind the poor students in state who will not be able to pay huge Moreover, it had to dispel suspicions among student community on admissions into unaided minority colleges in the backdrop of the recent SC verdict.

He asked the government to put a check the alleged money-making by minority professional colleges. The government should take unilateral decisions and should consult parties on issues relating to professional colleges, he added.

15,Boat mishap survivors blame Goa govt for tragedy,"HYDERABAD: â€œI held on to a piece of thermacol and do not remember for how long was I in the water. I saw my brother at some distance struggling to stay afloat. I couldnâ€™t help him and he drowned,â€™â€™ V Srinivas Rao, one of the survivors of the tourist boat capsize in Goa, said as he recalled the incident on his return to the city on Thursday.

The bodies of the nine people who drowned in the tragedy off the Anjuna and Baga beaches in Goa were brought to the city in an IC 915 Goa-Bangalore-Hyderabad Indian Airlines flight.

As many as 210 people had been on a six-day visit to Goa organised by the Insecticides Corporation India Limited as part of a company tour. They had reached Goa on Monday and went to Baga beach after a conference on Tuesday evening. â€œAbout 150 of us went to Baga beach and from there moved to Anjuna beach. Almost all of those who came to the beach took the boat trip. Our group of 25 was the last to take the trip,â€™â€™ another survivor, R Manchi Srinivas Rao, said.

The boat was going extremely fast and it overturned, he said. â€œThe capacity of the boat was eight or nine people. We were 25 and didnâ€™t know that the boat had no licence, no life jackets or ropes. As soon as the boat capsized, I held on to a piece of wood and kept myself afloat,â€™â€™ Srinivas Rao said. â€œWe shouted for help and after about an hour or so, some fishermen came to help us. They pulled out 16 of us,â€™â€™ another survivor S Keshav Rao said.

Those who could not get a help were in the water till late in the night and were fished out only after the Goa government sent helicopters, he added. â€œItâ€™s not the fault of the company. Itâ€™s the fault of the Goa government which doesnâ€™t take care to ensure that the boats are licensed,â€™â€™ Srinivas Rao said.

16,Naidu raps PR minister,"HYDERABAD: Chief minister Chandrababu Naidu on Thursday rapped panchayat raj minister N Janardhan Reddy and finance department officials for poor co-ordination in taking up drought-relief measures in the state.

Reviewing drought-relief measures and a host of other issues with district collectors during a videoconference at Secretariat here, Naidu expressed his displeasure over poor â€˜qualitativeâ€™ review by gram panchayats on employment generation.

The chief minister questioned the panchayat raj minister for the delay in filling up superintendent engineer posts in his department. â€œYou are supposed to identify problems and coordinate with the finance department in implementing relief measures. If you cannot solve the problems, I will solve it,â€� Naidu told the embarrassed minister.

He asked the collectors to give feedback on the Jalachaitanyam programme and the Rs 1120-cr drip irrigation project for generating an action plan.

Naidu also reviewed drinking water shortage, employment generation, release of drought pensions, accountability in water management and the impact of transportersâ€™ strike on essential goods. Reiterating the importance of water harvesting structures, the chief minister directed the municipal administration principal secretary to work out incentives for promoting the concept.

He said people should get incentives in property tax if they construct water harvesting pits and those who do not respond must be fined. He said permission would be given to new buildings only if they have a provision for a water harvesting pit in the plan.

Naidu said the panchayat raj department would soon issue guidelines to spend general funds of mandal and gram panchayats for relief measures, if necessary. He asked the ministers and collectors to tour their respective districts at least thrice a week to mitigate the woes of the affected people. He asked supervisory officers to review records at sarpanchlevel and at fair price shops for synchronising relief works.

The collectors were also directed not to release rice to mandals where works were below 50 per cent of the set target. He said that of the 80,740 works that have been grounded across the state , 25,478 have been completed. Reviewing the upcoming â€˜Clean and Greenâ€™ programme, he asked all the collectors to ensure that there was substantial improvement in the levels of hygiene. A control room under the purview of the chief secretary, in co-ordination with the RTA commissioner, was set up to monitor transportation of essential goods with the help of RTC buses, he added.

17,Suspect had brush with politics too,"HYDERABAD: Mohammed Abdul Rauf, one of the four accused arrested in connection with the murder of former Gujarat home minister Haren Pandya, had contested the municipal elections on an MIM ticket from Akberbagh last year.

The eldest son of Abdul Quadir and a resident of Asman Gadh in New Saidabad Colony, 28-year-old Rauf is a real-estate businessman. His father is an attendent with the veterinary department.

When contacted, MIM floor leader Asaduddin Owaisi said Rauf was initially a TDP man. However, when he was not given a party ticket by the TDP he joined the MIM and contested the civic polls. â€œI donâ€™t know on what charges Rauf was arrested,â€� Owaisi said adding that he was informed of Raufâ€™s arrest by his family members.

According to the sources, Rauf had been arrested in connection with the sensational Devender murder case a few years ago. However, he was reportedly acquitted in that case.

According to police, explosives had been recovered from his possession and two others in 2000 and a case was registered in Saidabad police station. The CID too registered a conspiracy case relating to the theatre bomb blasts in Hyderabad, Metpally and Nanded in Maharashtra. Similarly, he was involved in the Kakatiya Hotel blast case in Moghalpura along with Asghar Ali and others.

According to Raufâ€™s mother Rukhiya Bee, Rauf was taken into custody by plainclothesmen on Wednesday morning. The police apparently bundled Rauf into his own van and sped off. Raufâ€™s parents have sent telegrams to the governor, CM and other authorities pleading his innocence.

18,Surjeet backs Rajasthan govt's action against Togadia,"NEW DELHI: CPM general secretary H K S Surjeet on Thursday strongly endorsed VHP leader Praveen Togadia''s arrest in Rajasthan for violating laws by distributing tridents to his supporters.

""The Rajasthan government has taken the correct position,"" Surjeet told reporters while briefing them on the deliberations of the party politburo over the past three days.

The party opposed the recent legislation to pave the way for the election of Rajya Sabha members through the open ballot system. It also criticised the other provision of the Bill doing away with the requirement for the candidate to belong to the state he was contesting from.

""It goes against the basic premise that the Rajya Sabha is a council of states as provided in the Constitution,"" the politburo said.

The party favoured the earlier system by stating that ""the secret ballot system cannot be given up because of some parties'' inability to exercise minimum discipline over their MLAs"".

While denouncing the police action against Opposition activists in Kerala, the party took note of the growing dissidence in the ruling Congress. Replying to questions, however, Surjeet did not make clear whether his party, the main opposition in the state, would side with the Congress dissidents in any move to topple the UDF government there.

Taking note of the recent Supreme Court order rejecting the Vajpayee government''s plea to allow activities on the acquired land in Ayodhya, the party said that the Centre now had no choice but to firmly uphold the law restraining the VHP.

Surjeet said that he did not have much expectation from the Prime Minister''s visit to Kashmir. He added that a permanent solution to the Kashmir problem required a fresh effort to evaluate the erosion that had taken place in the ambit of Article 370.

He expressed confidence that the CPM would sweep the three-tier panchayat elections in West Bengal.

19,SC dismisses plea seeking uniform dress code for lawyers,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court has dismissed a petition seeking a directive to apply a uniform dress code for both senior advocates and other advocates.

A Bench of Justices S Rajendra Babu and G P Mathur dismissed the appeal filed by the Lawyers Reformist Forum after hearing arguments from its counsel N N Keshwani.

He said that the rule of Advocates Act did not distinguish between ""seniors"" and other advocates as far as dress was concerned.

The senior advocates wear twin coats with gowns which is slightly different from those worn by other advocates.

He said that the traditional use of such coats and gowns by the senior advocates was illegal as no tradition could override a law unless specifically provided for by law enacted by Parliament.
