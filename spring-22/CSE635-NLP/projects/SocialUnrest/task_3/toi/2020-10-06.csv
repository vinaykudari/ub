1,Modi govt high on rhetoric: Navnirman Front chief,"AHMEDABAD: Lashing out at the Modi government in a rally and public meeting organised here on Sunday, MahaGujarat Navnirman Front leader K S Shastri said that the present government is ""high on rhetoric but fails in action on all counts"".

A large number of protesters took part in the rally which started at the Town Hall and later passed through the city to culminate in a public meeting at J P Chowk. Shastri said that the Modi government scores a zero on progressive thoughts and administration. ""It is high on rhetoric but fails to deliver on all counts, be it industry, trade, education, agriculture or any other aspect.

Its one-point agenda is to divide the society and uses force in its attempt to do so,"" he said. He said that the government does not allow a democratic form of protest through rallies and public seminars. The rally was attended by a range of protesters, including teachers, workers, students, Dalits, farmers, doctors, lawyers, businessmen, traders and members of voluntary organisations.

2,Debt-ridden Modi govt looks to Centre for bailout,"GANDHINAGAR: The alarm bells are ringing in the Sachivalaya over the jump in the public debt of the Gujarat government â€” up from Rs 44,064 crore last year to Rs 52,292 crore this year.

These figures may not mean much to the man on the street, except that the state government, which does not have the money to undertake development works after paying off the huge interest burden, may have to pass on some of the load through increased taxation in the coming budgets.

But the desire to resist this unpopular move is evident â€” from the Gujarat government''s desperate request to the Centre for a one-time debt relief of 20 per cent on total outstandings and a five-year moratorium on the payment of both the principal and the interest amount. These unusual requests are included in a just-drafted memorandum, to be handed over to the Union finance ministry shortly. It also seeks rescheduling of the state''s debts and slashing of interest rates on them to six per cent.

The document, currently in the form of a preliminary draft, gives six reasons for the massive rise in the state''s borrowings â€” poor devolution of Union taxes to the state; rising establishment expenses on employees'' salaries; rising expectations for developing the social sector; successive onslaught of natural disasters like cyclones, droughts and the earthquake; stagnation of tax revenues due to slowdown of the industrial sector; and high interest rates charged by the Centre on the loans granted to the state.

Calling these ""unavoidable borrowings"", the document says they were thrust upon the state, destabilising the state finances and putting them under stress. The memorandum states that ""the rate of growth of debt should not be more than the average rate of growth of the gross state domestic product (GSDP), or else the debt will not be sustainable"". During 1998-2003, the GSDP has grown at an average rate of 7.5 per cent per annum, whereas the public debt has grown at the rate of 24 per cent, certainly not a sustainable rate.

As a result of these factors, the document says, the ratio of the public debt to the GSDP climbed up from a comfortable level of 14-15 per cent of the early 1990s to an alarming level of 38 per cent in 2003. This has also led to a dramatic increase in the interest outgo, despite a lower interest rate. The interest as percentage of revenue expenditure, which hovered at a comfortable level of 14-15 per cent in the early 1990s, has now climbed to more than 23 per cent in 2003. The document says the situation has worsened due to ""abnormally high interest rates"" charged by the Centre on its loans and old small savings loans.

The average rate of interest charged by the Centre is 12.9 per cent, whereas the present market rate is less than six per cent. The current requirements suggest that the state would have to borrow at least Rs 4,000-5,000 crore per annum to balance the revenue deficit and another Rs 3,000 crore per annum to finance the developmental capital outlays. It would mean, the net incremental borrowing would reach around Rs 7,000-8,000 crore per annum. ""Such heavy borrowing, even in today''s subdued interest environment, will lead to a net incremental outgo of Rs 600-800 crore towards interest and severely destabilise the revenue account,"" says the memorandum.

3,Murali's statement harming congress: KPCC leader,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee President K Muraleedharan''s recent statement on matters relating to the functioning of UDF government was harming the Party, KPCC General Secretary Thalekunnil Basheer said on Monday.

Addressing a press meet here, he said Muraleedharan''s statements were ""unbecoming"" to the post he was holding. Both Muraleedharan and CPI-M have a ""common agenda of removing Chief Minister A K Antony from the post and destroy the congress,"" he said.

""They are holding hands together on this common agenda and senior congress leader K Karunakaran was behind this,"" Basheer, an ""A"" faction leader and loyal to Antony, said.

Their agenda was clear from the statements of Muraleedharan and CPI-M leaders against the amicable settlement reached on the Marad issue,Basheer pointed out.

The attempt to remove Antony from the post of Chief Minister was in violation of all democratic and political norms. It was surprising that some in the party were demanding a leadership change when Antony enjoyed majority support both in Congress Legislature Party and UDF legislature party, he said.

Congressmen in the state would not allow anybody ""to tie Congress in the CPI-M stable,"" he added.

4,Buddha walks rally tightrope,"KOLKATA: The high court ruling on rallies and the Left Front''s defiance have made things worse for Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.

As chief minister, he can''t ignore the ruling and allow his police to be snubbed by the court again. But, he can''t let down his party, too.

This is not all. Close on the heels of the CPM youth wing DYFI rally on October 13, the Forward Bloc has called one on October 20 culminating in a gathering at Shyambazar. ""We organise a rally on this day every year to commemorate the Azad Hind government. We will pay tribute to the Azad Hind martyrs and march to the Netaji statute at Shyambazar. We will seek police permission, but if it is denied will break law,"" said Forward Bloc state secretary Ashoke Ghosh.

Bhattacharjee was busy on Monday discussing with party officials at Alimuddin Street and law minister Nisith Adhikari working on a way out of the catch-22 situation.

The chief minister doesn''t feel comfortable with the plea that the police can overlook the DYFI rally as they are yet to get a certified copy of the court order. Legal experts don''t see much merit in it because the contemnor, DC (traffic) M.K. Singh, was present in court and heard the ruling.

City police headquarters sources said they are yet to receive an application from the DYFI.

""We can''t grant permission for such a rally. In that case, the rallyists would naturally be prosecuted,"" said an officer.

The penalty may be fines or imprisonment. None of the officers wanted to be quoted on the issue, showing how sensitive it was.

DC (headquarters) Kuldeep Singh refused to comment.

The special branch recommended major security arrangements throughout the route of the rally from College Street to Rani Rashmani Avenue. The police are likely to remain passive to avoid confrontation with the organisers.

Police sources said they would arrange enough buses to facilitate arrest of the rallyists, if the situation demanded.

5,Euro-III laws: Can we breathe easy?,"NEW DELHI: Residents in the national Capital and 10 other cities may breathe slightly cleaner air two years from now. On Monday, the government announced that new vehicles in 11 cities will have to conform to Euro-III emission norms from April 1, 2005.

The 10 other cities are: Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Ahmedabad, Pune, Surat, Kanpur and Agra. Vehicles here, at present, conform to Euro-II norms. They will graduate to Euro-IV norms from April 1, 2010. The rest of the country will have Euro-III norms by 2010.

This will help, say experts, but it will just not be enough. For one, the government is silent on its policy towards grossly polluting vehicles already on the road. Unless these are tackled or phased out and unless the roads match the norms, emission norms alone will not filter the dirty air.

In Delhiâ€™s case, polluting trucks and inter-state buses get four years more to meet even the basic Euro-I standard. The situation in smaller cities, say experts, is so bad that more drastic measures are called for. In fact, energy expert R K Pachauri said it would have made economic and environmental sense to jump straight from Euro-II to Euro-IV norms, enforcing these for the 11 cities by 2007 and for all cities by 2010.

â€˜â€˜It will also be a question of enforcement,â€™â€™ he said. Meanwhile, the Centre for Science and Environment has termed the policy as an eyewash, saying it will only play into the hands of polluters. The government said for two and three-wheelers, Euro-II norms will be applicable from April 1, 2005.

Euro-III norms would come into force preferably by April 1, 2008, but not later than April 1, 2010, oil minister Ram Naik said, while announcing the policy. After April 1, 2007, inter-state buses/trucks would not be allowed to originate/terminate in Delhi unless they meet minimum of Euro-I emission norms. The cut-off point for meeting Euro-II norms will be April 1, 2011.

6,Delhi elections on December 1,"NEW DELHI: With the announcement of elections to the Delhi assembly on December 1, Congress president Sonia Gandhi has put her weight firmly behind chief minister Sheila Dikshit. At a high-level party meeting, Sonia gave â€˜â€˜sweeping powersâ€™â€™ to Dikshit and said she was free to deny tickets to all non-performing MLAs.

â€˜â€˜We are going to drop at least 25 to 30 sitting MLAs out of 52 and bring in new, popular faces. The CM has always advocated that she prefers performers to yes men in her team,â€™â€™ said a Congress leader. Sonia has also made it clear that she will not allow any other Congress leader in the city to project himself as an alternative to Dikshit. â€˜â€˜Among the new faces, we may find heavyweights like Jagdish Tytler and Sajjan Kumar contesting assembly elections.

But neither should even dream of becoming the next CM. Sonia has made it clear that the people of Delhi will choose their CM and controlling MLAs from outside will be a useless exercise,â€™â€™ said a Congress minister. Dikshit has had to contend with detractors throughout her career. In fact, the party election committee, which decides on ticket distribution, has got major representation from the anti-Dikshit camp.

â€˜â€˜The Congress high command has thrown itâ€™s weight behind the CM at the right time. She is the most popular Congress leader in the city and the party wants this election to be a straight fight between Dikshit and BJP chief Madan Lal Khurana.â€™â€™ The high-commandâ€™s support for Dikshit is being seen as a reaction to secret surveys indicating that Khurana is slowly gaining ground in Delhi.

Party sources said Khurana seemed to have benefited from the support of young political advisors, an unprecedented united leadership and an extremely helpful Central government. The decision to make Dikshit more powerful in the party also stems from the fact that she is quite popular with the middle-class and the younger generation. Even surveys carried out by the Congress clearly show that there is no anti-incumbency factor against her.

9,Kushinagar firing takes a political hue,"LUCKNOW: The Kushinagar police firing incident which claimed the lives of four protestors on Saturday seems to be taking a political hue with state BJP president Vinay Katiyar, party general secertary Ramapati Ram Tripathi and former minister Surya Pratap Sahi on Monday staging a dharna at the site of the firing.

Meanwhile, a case of murder has been lodged against former district magistrate Ashish Goel, superintendent of police RA Gautum and incharge of Ram Kola police station, Ram Avtar Yadav who were placed under suspension following the incident.

Tension prevails in Kushinagar where four youths fell prey to the police bullets.

Hundreds of residents of Deoraj Pipra village in Haata Kotwali of Kushinagar have been on a protest dharna for almost fortnight demanding construction of Deoraj Pipraghat bridge.

Reports said the proposal for bridge construction had been okayed by the state government and necessary action recommended, but some local elements were opposing the project, thus leaving the locals to take up the issue.

Family members of the four shot dead in the firing, Yogendra Chauhan, Ram Milan, Chote Lal and Nandu, claimed the protest was peaceful and there was no indication of any aggressive posture till Goel arrived on the scene and entered into a verbal duel.

Thereafter, he ordered the firing and the situation took an ungly turn.

Newly appointed DM Jagannath Singh and SP DB Misra have assumed charge and were monitoring the situation which was now described as well under control by the home department officials.

10,Laloo blames RSS for Ara violence,"PATNA: The communal violence in Bhojpur district has triggered off charges and counter-charges between rival political parties.

The Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief Laloo Prasad Yadav rushed to the spot on Monday to take stock of the situation.

Speaking to journalists before going to Ara, the RJD chief said the state government has ordered a high-level probe into the violence and the subsequent police firing. He blamed the Rashtriya Svayamsevak Sangh (RSS) for fomenting violence and alleged that the communal incident was a sinister design to malign the state. ""Nobody found guilty for the violence will be spared,"" he stressed.

The state unit of CPI(ML) has charged the BJP and Bajrang Dal activists with engineering communal violence by spreading rumours.

The party has criticised the burning of over one dozen shops belonging to the minority community.

It has appealed to the people of Sheesh Mahal Chowk locality to maintain communal harmony and defeat the designs of communal forces.

The party also alleged that members of the Sangh Parivar had recently taken out a procession displaying swords and spears at Ara and poisoned the atmosphere of the town. The CPI-ML held a peace march in the town.

However, the state Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) has described the Ara violence as a result of the policy of ""minority appeasement"" followed by the state government.

It also criticised the killing of two persons in police firing. It said that if Bihar becomes another Gujarat, the state government''s policy will be responsible for it.

The Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) has also issued an identical statement on the incident.

12,US questions credibility of Chechnya polls,"WASHINGTON: Within ten days of President George W Bush''s public endorsement of the Russian position on Chechnya as part of the war against global terrorism, the US State Department has questioned the ""credibility and legitimacy"" of the elections just held there by the central government.

Going back to the old anti-Russian line sympathetic to the insurgents supported by Islamic fundamentalists, the State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said on Monday, ""Unfortunately, the Presidential election that took place on Sunday and the political process that led up to it, fell short of the potential for producing a positive democratic outcome.""

Boucher said the US had believed that the constitutional referendum in March and the autumn Chechnya elections could be useful steps towards a political settlement; but that did not happen. ""The exit of all viable challengers to Akhmed Kadyrov''s candidacy and the overt control of Chechen media by pro-Kadyrov forces prior to election day lead us to conclude that the election did not meet international standards for fair and free elections. We are disappointed by this missed opportunity,"" Boucher said. He asserted that Bush raised his concern about the Chechnya elections in his Camp David meetings with President Putin about ten days ago.

Nevertheless, he said, the US continued to hope that the people of Chechnya and their leaders, working with Russian officials, ""will find ways to end terrorism and human rights abuses, resolve the conflict and establish a more normal life based on democratic principles"".

13,Rs 132-bn investments for 40 mn tons cement demand,"AHMEDABAD: The demand growth of the cement industry over the next five years will be robust enough to absorb 40 million tonnes of greenfield capacity according to Crisil Research & Information Services Ltd (CRIS INFAC) new report on the long-term outlook of this sector.

This capacity addition will translate into an investment of nearly Rs 132 billion and will lead the upturn in capital investments in India.

In the long term, CRIS INFAC sees prices being driven upwards by the effect of the withdrawal of sales tax incentives and the limited scope to increase blending. However, if the expected capacity additions are bunched into a short time period, prices will move down-wards, putting pressure on margins. In the short term, a robust moderate recovery in prices is expected, leading to an improvement in the credit profile of the industry.

Most of this capacity will be implemented by large players due to their strong financial position, leading to further increase in consolidation. The report remains wary of the pace of the capacity additions and says that staggered capacity additions will be essential to protect the credit profile of the industry.

Cement consumption will cross 165 million tones in 2007-08, up from 107 million tones in 2002-03. This growth in demand will support capacity additions of up to 50 million tonnes, while maintaining aggregate capacity utilizsation at nearly 85% per cent in the year 2007-08. Of the 50 million tonnes of fresh capacity, about 10 million will be by way of debottlenecking and blended cement, necessitating greenfield capacity additions of nearly 40 million tonnes.

CRIS INFAC estimates that about 23 million tonnes, around 16% per cent of existing capacity could change hands over the medium term. The estimate is based on the assumption that capacities that do not form the core business of a group and those that have been incurring losses due to process inefficiencies or high financial costs would be up for sale.

The top two Indian cement groups, Grasim-Cemco (L&Tâ€™s cement division) and Gujarat Ambuja-ACC have a 40 per cent share. These two groups, along with large regional players, will play a major role in capacity additions and acquisitions, leading to an increasinge in consolidation further.

CRIS INFAC believes that the presence of foreign players will be limited in the Indian market in the absence of significant avenues for the acquisition of a large capacity.

16,CII concerned over increase in states' fiscal deficit,"KOLKATA: The Confederation of Indian Industry is apprehensive that appreciation of the Indian rupee and the dismal condition of the state governments'' finances may ""cloud the significantly positive outlook for the economic growth"" of the country.

In view of the good rainfall, CII revised the country''s GDP growth forecast to anything between 6.5 per cent and 6.8 per cent compared to the previous GDP target of six per cent to 6.4 per cent. The CII has revised the GDP estimates on the basis that agricultural output would increase between four per cent and 5.5 per cent.

Expressing concern over the appreciating rupee, a CII document said during the past year, the rupee appreciated by 4.7 per cent against the greenback and the ""appreciation has been particularly sharp over the last quarter"".

CII feels that the differential in domestic and foreign interest rates was creating â€œartitrage driven inflowsâ€�. This sustained currency appreciation, said CII, would be â€œa new challenge to the competitiveness of Indian manufacturers as they have to evaluate whether their products cost less than imports in rupee termsâ€�.

Expressing concern over the â€œalarming increaseâ€� in fiscal deficit of states, CII noted that since 1994-95, state governments have been financing their deficits by bond-financed special purpose vehicle (SPVs), backed by government (state) guarantees. But, â€œmost of them are worse than junk bonds, backed by the promises of fiscally bankrupt statesâ€�, it felt.

CII felt that if the issue was not â€œtackled immediatelyâ€�, it might explode as â€œpayment defaultsâ€� which in turn would affect respective bondholders like state cooperative banks and ultimately their deposit holders.

In his prescription on tackling rupee appreciation, CII chief economist Omkar Goswami advocated that it could be contained either by issuing infrastructure bonds or by adjusting the repo rate. Goswami, however, was of the view that since floating of infrastructure bonds would invite a structural change, â€œperhaps an adjustment of the repo rate would be a better course of actionâ€�.

Referring to inflation rate, CII felt that in the current fiscal the average inflation would hover around five per cent while inflation in the manufactured products is likely to be lower at around 4.5 per cent.

17,"Plot to kill minister foiled, 8 held","AHMEDABAD: The Detection of Crime Branch (DCB) on Tuesday claimed to have busted yet another international conspiracy to terrorise Gujarat.

DCB has arrested eight persons, including four from Mumbai, and have charged them with conspiring to kill the state law minister Ash Bhatt.

This conspiracy dates back to June, 2003, just before the Rath Yatra celebrations. On June 23 around 2.30 am DCB officials gunned down Ganesh Khute (25) and Mahendra Jadav (29) near Kapadbazar in Panchkuva area of the walled city.

DCB authorities then had alleged that the two were professional killers from Mumbai''s underworld who were in the city to spread terror and spark communal passions.

The gunmen were supposed to have targetted Bhatt and former state minister and BJP MLA Bharat Barot.

The ''hit'' which was slated to take place during the Rath Yatra festivities was foiled when DCB officials caught up with the gunmen who were surveying the Rath Yatra procession route and shot them down.

Three months later the DCB claimed that investigations into this case has revealed that the conspiracy was masterminded by ISI and Lashkar-e-Taeba. And, that unlike the Akshardham attack (that DCB claims was rooted in Saudi Arabia) this conspiracy had been supervised from Dhaka by Vikram Parmar, a member of Mumbai underworld with links in Ahmedabad.

Those arrested by DCB from Mumra locality of Thane district in Mumbai are Parmar''s wife Fatima, her sons Amir and Alam and Amiruddin Sayyed alias Mamu. The accused picked up from Ahmedabad are Parmar''s brothers Omprakash and Manoj and his sister Lakshmi Prasad.

Lakshmi''s son Rajesh Hanuman Prasad alias Nasir also has been arrested by the DCB. Sources told TNN that like in the other conspiracy cases these accused also are likely to be booked under Pota.

18,Attack on scribe sparks protest against Rajkumar,"MYSORE: The alleged assault on a scribe by film actor Punneth Rajkumar sparked off protests in Mysore on Tuesday.

While the members of the Dr Rajkumar fans association staged a dharna against journalists for allegedly charging the actor of beating up a local television channel report, the volunteers of Jayaprakash Narayan Andolan samiti, Kannade Vedike Sarvajanika samiti and workers of Janata Parivar staged a dharna at the deputy commissioner''s office condemning the attack.

At one point of time, the protest by Rajkumar fans'' association appeared to be taking on an ugly turn when they tried to chase away the people who were protesting against the actor''s misbehaviour with the journalists.

Police officials intervened to prevent any untoward incident and also prevented the actor''s supporters from taking out a procession as they had not taken permission to do so.

DCP Poonacha who arrived on the spot warned of severe action if the actor''s supporters failed to wind up their protest.

The police have booked a non-cognizable case against the actor based on a complaint filed by the reporter of the television channel.

Police have also provided security to the channel office and the alleged victim.

19,Our family will never enter politics: Parvathamma Rajkumar,"BANGALORE: Parvathamma Rajkumar said on Tuesday that neither she nor her family members would ever enter politics.

Speaking to reporters here, Parvathamma said: ""The earlier Congress and Janata Dal governments had offered me an MLC post. Several times the industry members asked me to be film chamber or producers association president or office-bearer. I have always declined, for when Rajkumar himself does not want such things, why should any member of his family take it up?""

Turning emotional, Parvathamma said she was being painted as a villain who is out to grab everything. ""They say I will even sell my son to Telugu filmproducers to get more money. Why should I? I have never indulged in politicking even within the film industry. When people asked me for support to fight a cause, I have gone, but never led anything.""

Both Parvathamma and her son Raghavendra stated that there was no truth in allegations of their pressure on theatres to take out movies which run successfully and replace them with their own.""We had got letters from theatres confirming that our film Chigurida Kanasu will be screened there, so we went ahead with the publicity. We had no intention of removing a successfully running movie and once we discussed the issue with that producer, we delayed release of our film in some theatres,"" Raghavendra pointed out.

Raghavendra said the only way to solve the problem of shortage of theatres was for all producers to sit with distributors and exhibitors and discuss it. ""We are always willing to do this,"" he added.

The bench observed that accident statistics had nearly doubled because the state government had not implemented the helmet rule. The rule had been relaxed in the mid 90''s.

The bench directed the state to implement Sections 128 and 129 of the Motor Vehicles Act. While Section 128 deals with safety measures for drivers and pillion riders, the other section deals with wearing of protective headgear - helmet.

The bench was hearing an accident claims case dealing with the rider and pillion rider of a two-wheeler.

Quoting statistics on the increased number of accidents in the state, the bench observed that several thousand accidents occur among motorists in the age group of 18 to 28 years.

The bench also made a mention of the inadequate medical facilities available in the state in connection to accident relief. Neurosurgeons in NIMHANS have to spend anywhere between six to 10 hours initially to deal with head injury victims.

The court observed that in every one of the cases (accidents), there is a heavy liability irrespective of age, death or injury in relation to compensation.

After recommending the implementation of the helmet rule, the bench directed the state government to report to the court within four weeks.

22,DCB cracks another plot to avenge riots,"AHMEDABAD: The Detection of Crime Branch (DCB) of Ahmedabad police on Tuesday claimed to have busted yet another international conspiracy to avenge the communal riots of 2002 through terrorist attacks in Gujarat.

DCB arrested eight persons, including four from Mumbai, and have charged them with conspiring to kill the state law minister Ashok Bhatt. One Chinese pistol, one revolver and 20 cartridges have been seized from those arrested from Ahmedabad. This conspiracy dates back to June 2003, just before the Rath Yatra celebrations. On June 23, at around 2.30 am, DCB officials gunned down Ganesh Khute (25) and Mahendra Jadav (29) near Kapadbazar in Panchkuva area.

The DCB had alleged that the two were professional killers from Mumbaiâ€™s underworld who were here to spread terror. Besides Bhatt, BJP MLA Bharat Barot, was also said to be a target. The â€˜hitâ€™ which was slated to take place during the Rath Yatra festivities was foiled when DCB officials caught up with the gunmen who were surveying the procession route and shot them down.

Three months later, the DCB claimed that investigations have revealed that the conspiracy was masterminded by ISI and Lashkar-e-Toiba. And that this conspiracy had been supervised from Dhaka by Vikram Parmar, a member of Mumbai underworld, with links in Ahmedabad. Those arrested by DCB from Mumra locality of Thane are Parmarâ€™s wife Fatima, her sons Amir and Alam and Amiruddin Sayyed alias Mamu. The accused picked up from Ahmedabad are Parmarâ€™s brothers Omprakash and Manoj and his sister Laxmi. Laxmiâ€™s son Rajesh Hanuman Prasad alias Nasir has also been arrested by the DCB.

These accused are likely to be booked under Pota. DCP (crime) D G Vanzara said, â€œThe two shooters died in an encounter when they were headed towards Panchkuva to meet Rajesh who we then knew as Nasir. All the eight arrested are related to the prime accused Vikram who was the resource person for Dawood Ibrahim and Chhota Shakeel. The underworld dons are in turn working in tandem with ISI and LeT.â€� Police officials say the ISI and LeT link to this conspiracy has been established by the central intelligence agencies. Rajesh was the first person to be nabbed by the DCB.

His arrest, said Vanzara, led to unravelling of the conspiracy and its roots in Dhaka. Rajesh often used to go to Mumbai to meet Parmar. Vanzara said that Parmar hails from Ujjain and had been arrested in 2001 by the city police for another such plot to kill â€œHindu leadersâ€�. Parmar became the perfect choice as he stayed with his wife and children in Thane while his sister and brothers stay in Naroda, Ahmedabad. â€œThe poverty-stricken families in Thane and Ahmedabad were used by the ISI and LeT as local support for their terror plans,â€� he said. The accused were remanded to 10-day police custody by metropolitan magistrate R I Rawal.
