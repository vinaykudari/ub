0,RSS spares govt on temple issue,"NAGPUR: If a message emerged from the three-day RSS pratinidhi sabha here, it was that the various Sangh organisations (22 of the 37 were represented) would do nothing to destabilise the Vajpayee government.

While RSS leaders were loath to state this baldly, one of them said on Sunday: ""The emphasis was on working together, projecting a united front and not talking at cross-purposes. This was the message driven home by the elders.""

There was also an effort to give the RSS a younger look, with sarkaryavah (general secretary) Mohan Bhagwat, who was re-elected to the position for another term, naming a younger team to assist him. So, while Madan Das Devi continues as joint general secretary, Suresh Soni and Suresh Joshi, both aged 50, have also been appointed to the same post, while the ageing H V Seshadri has been moved out to a less taxing position. Similarly Hosabale Datatreya, ABVP all-India organising secretary, becomes sahaboudhik pramukh.

Ram Madhav, till now junior spokesperson, replaces M G Vaidya as the sole spokesperson.But Vaidya''s exit is being seen as more than an effort to give the RSS a more youthful appeal. His son, and recently, his daughter-in-law, have been embroiled in the petrol pump and bank scams, respectively, and the Sangh was finding it an embarrassment. There was an oblique reference in Bhagwat''s speech to the pratinidhi sabha, when he stressed the need to set ""new examples of high standards in character in their respective fields"".

The RSS'' effort to ""protect"" the Vajpayee government was evident from the tone of the press briefings as well as from the subject of the four resolutions that were adopted. The first three, on Shri Ma, Veer Savarkar, and demanding the repeal of the Illegal Migrants Determination by Tribunal Act in Assam, were targeted at the opposition, specifically the Congress and the Left parties.

But subjects such as the Ram temple, the demand for legislation to ban cow slaughter and disinvestment, which could embarrass the BJP-led government by highlighting the differences within the NDA, were left out of the resolutions altogether.

The fourth resolution on agriculture had a swadeshi undertone in its attack on GM foods and stress on indigenous research, but it in no way clashed with the government''s economic policy. The demand for a better price for agricultural produce was clearly reflective of the RSS'' desire to voice farmers'' aspirations.

When RSS functionary Srikant Joshi was asked whether the RSS, too, wished to see a rollback on the hike in fertiliser prices, he dodged a direct reply, saying: ""We believe in organic, not chemical fertilisers.""

Bhagwat, in his opening address, may have said ""the time is fast approaching for us to once again become active in the Ram Mandir movement"", and the RSS has exhorted its affiliates to support the VHP campaign, but it was made equally clear that there were to be no verbal clashes in public. Clearly, while full use is to be made of the Ayodhya issue as a vehicle to carry the Hindutva message in the run-up to the polls, it should not destabilise the government.

1,Dues on ex-minister: Govt in grip of amnesia,"LUCKNOW: Even after a terse message from Raj Bhawan, the Mayawati government seems not serious about initiating action against former minister Markandey Chand for recovery of stamp duty evasion to the tune of Rs 2.87 crore.

Taking advantage of the laxity on the part of the state government, the former minister has obtained an order from the Allahabad High Court staying the operation of the recovery notices till March 25.

The Mayawati government had issued a GO (1498/9-A-4-2002) dated January 4, 2003, for realising Rs 2,87,67,021 from the former minister for evading stamp duty on registration of a prime plot (number 103) at Golghar in Gorakhpur. Subsequently, the DM and the tehsildar of Gorakhpur had served recovery notices on January 27, 2003 for realising the dues.

A

lthough the state administration claimed to have served the recovery notice but the former minister challenged the GO. In a writ petition (6034/2003), filed at the Allahabad High Court, Chandâ€™s counsel argued that ""no notice/information of any kind at any stage whatsoever was given to the petitioner before passing the impugned order proposing to recover stamp duty dues. The impugned order also does not indicate that any opportunity of hearing was given to the petitioner at any stage.""

Listing the case for March 25, a bench of the Allahabad High Court admitted the petition on February 10, 2002, directing the state government to file counter affidavit on objections raised by the petitioner.

Till the next date of hearing, the court has directed the state government to stay the recovery proceedings against Chand.

Chand is the third former minister of the Rajnath cabinet indicted by the Lokayukta. Even though Lokayukta Justice SC Varma had sent his report with a recommendation for realising the dues from Chand in February 2002, the state government chose to sit over the report.

In November last year the Lokayukta had shot off a letter to governor Vishnukant Shastri requesting him to seek action taken report from the government. The governorâ€™s terse message finally woke the government from its slumber and it issued the GO for recovery of dues from the former minister.

But a little ignorance, deliberate or inadvertent, on the part of the government led the case land into legal wranglings again. ""We are hopeful to get the stay vacated by the court,"" stated a law department official claiming at the recovery process would begin again once the petition was quashed.

3,Extensive plan to increase sugar yield,"LUCKNOW: Cane growers will be richer by Rs 4000 crore annually in UP, if the sugar cane yield (per hectare) is increased to an achievable 80 metric tonnes from that of 51.51 metric tonnes at present, which is one of the lowest in the country.

This sums up the government''s study being conducted to chalk out a project called Vision 2010 to increase the sugar cane productivity in the state, which is the largest producer of sugar after Maharashtra.

""It is only an irony that in spite of being the first in sugar cultivation in the country, having a total 20.69 lakh hectares under it and over 35 lakh cane growers depending on it for their sustenance, UP is now lagging behind in average yield as compared to states like Punjab, Haryana and Tamil Nadu, which have learnt cane growing from it,"" the study says.

In a way, it casts aspersions on successive governments in the past, which rather ignored the issue and refused to recognise the state''s main priority sector, still nursing 100 sugar mills despite the closer of several in the recent past.

Asked to comment on this, cane secretary Mohinder Singh admitted that the state had a potential to increase its annual yield of sugar cane worth Rs 10,000 crore.

The road map prepared for this purpose, he said, was based on micro as well as macro level planning. While training to farmers would be an integral part of it, the emphasis would be on new agro-practices based on scientific methods, popularisation of high-yielding seedlings of sugar cane and bridge the gap between lab and land, Singh said.

The strategy, he said, was two-pronged. While the sugar cane yield will be increased, the recovery of juice from it will be increased from existing 9.71 per cent to around 10.48 per cent.

The additional recovery, he said, would fetch over Rs 500 crore. As for recovery, he said it depended on so many factors and, for this, farmers needed to be trained in methods of better harvesting, timely transporting, mill operation, besides scientific planning at micro level.

The project which, he said, was being prepared at present, would need a financial input of Rs 1,000 crore. The government, he said, would try to rope in the support of the World Bank or some other international financial institution to fund the project.

Essentially, sugar cane was produced in 40 out of total 70 districts of UP and they are divided into three zones, namely East, West and Centre. Climatically, the western part is better suited for sugar cultivation and, because of this reason, politics in the area is governed by sugar lobby, which is wealthier as compared to that of the eastern region.

4,"'Bijli adalats' in state soon, says minister","GAYA: â€˜Bijli adalatsâ€™ for on the spot redressal of consumer grievances and brokering peace between the Bihar Electricity Board and its consumers wouldsoon be constituted in the state and efforts are on to find suitable persons to head the adalats.

This was revealed by the energy minister Shakeel Ahmed Khan in Gaya on Saturday evening after a review of the performance of the Magadh Area Board comprising the districts of Gaya, Aurangabad, Jehanabad, Nawada, Arwal, Rohtas and Bhabhua.

â€œIntegrity and a positive public image would be the only criterion in the nomination to the adalats and politics will not be allowed to creep in during the processâ€�, claimed the minister. During the review of the functioning of the Magadh Area Board, a wide gap was found between the demand and supply of power in the region. As against the requirement of 175 MW of power, the region is getting only 67 MW, which was even below 50 per cent of the requirement. Khan claimed that the efficiency of the power board has increased during the last two years.

However, he expressed dissatisfaction over the revenue collection, which, at Rs 4.5 crore per month was well below the establishment cost of the Magadh Area Board. â€œThe Magadh Area Boardâ€™s establishment cost alone was Rs 6 crore per monthâ€�, said Khan. He also said that the board officials have been directed to deliver results and improve revenue collection by not less than Rs one crore a month. It was also revealed that in the commercial consumer category, there was a large gap between the number of registered consumers and effective consumers, who actually paid the bill.

In Gaya town alone, the number of registered consumers of the commercial category was 9,200, while the number of effective consumers was only 4,500. Whereas, on paper the non-effective consumers were shown disconnected, they continued to consume electricity in a clandestine manner. He did not rule out the possibility of some board employees being hand in glove with the wrong doers. Such elements would be identified and punished.

â€œOnce the amended Electricity Act gets Presidential assent, it would be much easier to punish and even prosecute the moles within the power boardâ€�, Khan maintained. He also directed to slap power bills on government officials and realise the arrears from the date of joining and officials enjoying government accommodation. According to the general manager of the Magadh Area Board, Nagendra Singh, the Gaya power consumers alone owe Rs 200 crore to the board. The list of defaulters is headed by the Water Board, which has not paid bills to the tune of Rs 36 crore.

5,Lure of $25 mn may have led to Khalid's arrest,"NEW YORK: Lure of $25 million may have made a radical Egyptian to turn over Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, described as the ""brain"" behind al-Qaeda''s operations.

An Egyptian, who was arrested in a raid of an al-Qaeda safe-house in Pakistan''s border town of Quetta, made a deal with the US to reveal Khalid''s whereabouts in exchange for money, a Middle Eastern intelligence official is quoted as saying in a report in the upcoming issue of American news magazine, Newsweek.

The Egyptian, who was not identified, offered to dime out Mohammed, but demanded an additional 2 million dollars to relocate to Britain with his family.

A law-enforcement official told Newsweek that the US agreed to pay the reward to an unidentified informant, but wouldn''t discuss details.

Mohammed''s capture was the result of months of intelligence surveillance by US and Pakistani intelligence.

Five weeks ago, agents were tipped off to the safehouse in Quetta but Mohammed had already escaped when they got there, the report said.

However, they did capture a lower-ranked al-Qaeda soldier Muhammad Abdel-Rahman, a son of Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman, the blind Egyptian cleric convicted of plotting to blow up the United Nations and other New York landmarks.

6,30 pc increase in cases of HR violation: NHRC,"KOLHAPUR: The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has said that there has been a 30 per cent increase in cases of human rights violation as compared to last year.

However, there is general ignorance about the scope of human rights on part of government officers, particularly police personnel, district representative of the New Delhi-based NHRC and noted social worker from the region Dr Sunil Kumar Lavate said on Monday.

When the incidents of increased police atrocities, including the beating of college students by Panhala police, were brought to his notice, Lavate, who has been re-appointed to the post for second three-year term by state Home Ministry, assured to take cognisance of the cases.

""The innocent people below poverty line are becoming victims and in some cases, it has been found that the officers deliberately violate the human rights"", Lavate added.

7,"SP, BSP clash in LS","NEW DELHI: Samajwadi and BSP members in the Lok Sabha virtually came to blows on Monday as Mulayam Singh Yadav''s son took strong exception to certain remarks made by a BSP member against his father, forcing Speaker Manohar Joshi to abruptly adjourn the House for lunch recess ahead of schedule.

Angry over BSP member Ashok Chandel raising slogans against his father, Akhilesh Yadav pulled up his sleeves and menacingly moved towards him along with other SP colleagues.

Former Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar, Congress Chief Whip P R Dasmunsi, Shiv Sena leader Chandrakant Khaire and some others quickly intervened to prevent an ugly scene.

It all started when SP member Akhilesh Singh accused BSP leader Mayawati of having encouraged corruption by asking her party MPs of giving a cut from their development fund and demanded a CBI probe into it.

Singh, whose notice for an adjournment motion on the issue was disallowed by the Speaker, raised slogans against the UP chief minister.

This was countered by BSP members with Chandel making allegations against the SP chief.

As the atmosphere got surcharged, Joshi, who appealed to members not to raise slogans, adjourned the House.

Even after the adjournment, SP and BSP members were seen indulging in heated exchanges but were separated by Chandra Shekhar and other senior members.

8,US guiding NDA govt: Cong,"NEW DELHI: Agitated Congress members on Monday had heated exchanges in Lok Sabha with those from ruling BJP on the Iraq crisis after they alleged that the NDA government was being ""guided"" by the United States and asked Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee to make the government''s stand clear on various aspects of the issue.

Stating that the government was concerned about the evolving situation in Iraq, BJP chief whip Vijay Kumar Malhotra said the Prime Minister had convened an all-party meeting and accused the opposition of trying to gain ""political mileage"" by raising the matter before the meeting. They could raise the issue later after the meeting was over, he suggested.

When Congress chief whip Priyaranjan Dasmunsi and some of his colleagues charged that the NDA government was being ""guided"" by the United States, Malhotra retorted ""I say you and your party are being guided by the US.""

Malhotra wanted to know from the Leader of Opposition Sonia Gandhi ,as to why has she not made a statement on the Iraq issue clarifying her Congress party''s stand.

""You do not read newspapers,"" Dasmunsi reacted angrily saying the Congress and the Left parties were first to issue statements that the UN Security Council resolution must be adhered to in finding a solution to the crisis.

There is tension in the world, Malhotra said, adding both Houses had discussed the matter before the Prime Minister went to attend the NAM summit last month amid noisy interruptions from opposition benches.

Vajpayee has also made the government''s stand clear that whatever action was needed must be undertaken by UN Security Council, he said.

9,Balakrishnan Pillai sworn in as transport minister,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Kerala Congress (B) leader R Balakrishna Pillai was on Monday sworn in as minister in the A K Antony government replacing his son and Transport Minister K B Ganesh Kumar.

Governor Sikhander Bakht administered oath of office and secrecy at a function held at Rajabhavan attended by Speaker, Vakkom Purushothaman, State Chief Minister A K Antony and his Cabinet colleagues.

Ganesh Kumar resigned to pave the way for the induction of Pillai into the Cabinet after the latter was cleared by the Supreme Court in a corruption case last month.

The case related to the sale of electricity to a Karnataka-based firm when Pillai was Power Minister in mid 1980''s.

As Pillai''s appeal was pending in the apex court when UDF came to power in May 2001, his actor-turned-politician son was made the party''s nominee in the Cabinet.

10,HC nails truant law students,"NEW DELHI: The high court has struck down the promotion of all those law students to the next class who did not have the required attendance or failed to clear the minimum number of papers.

A public interest litigation (PIL) on the issue was filed by Delhi University''s Law Centre-II professor S N Singh. He challenged the promotion of students despite their not meeting basic norms like attendance.

A division Bench comprising Justice Usha Mehra and Justice Pradeep Nandrajog observed that such ""legal greenhorns"" should not be allowed to practice at the bar. ""We are now confronted with a situation where the university granted promotion to those second and third year students who were not entitled to be promoted,"" the Bench observed.

""We cannot permit a total violation of norms. Promotion of all students who cleared only four or 14 papers to the third and fifth term, respectively, are thus quashed,"" the Bench ruled.

The Bench ordered that the university would have to ensure there was no relaxation in the norms requiring a student to clear a minimum of five or 15 papers for promotion to the third or fifth term, respectively.

As per university rules, a term (also called semester) is of six months'' duration. A student has to read five papers in one term and 10 in a year. The LLB degree is a three-year course comprising six terms.

At the end of the first year, a student is required to clear a minimum of five papers for promotion to second year. At the end of second year, a minimum of 15 papers are to be cleared for promotion to third year.

The court rejected the students'' plea that they have already appeared for their second and third year examinations. On October 30, 2002, the court had already stayed their promotion to the next class. But it later allowed them to appear in the examination on the condition that their promotion to next class would be subject to the decision on the PIL.

11,Opp gears up for DGHC polls,"DARJEELING: Opposition parties in the hills are gearing up for the next Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council election scheduled for 2004.

The Bharatiya Gorkha Janashakti (BGJS) party, lying low so far, was revived at its fifth annual meeting on Sunday under the leadership of C.R. Rai.

Established in 1998, it welcomed the inclusion of the Tamangs and the Limbus in the Scheduled Tribe and also adopted a resolution that all the other Indian Gorkhas be included in this category to facilitate the inclusion of DGHC in the Sixth Schedule.

The BGJS also demanded the re-organisation of the DGHC geographical area visa-vis the proposal mooted by CPM leader Ananda Pathak. Pathak had placed a Bill in Parliament in 1985 for the regional autonomy of Darjeeling area wherein it proposed to include the entire Darjeeling hills and the Nepali speaking regions of the Dooars and Siliguri division.

In 1998, eight political parties of the hills came under a single umbrella and formed the Sanjukta Morcha. However, in 2000, due to internal feud, the party split.

This led to the formation of the United Democratic Front led by Rai himself and the Gorkhaland Sanjukta Morcha was led by CPRM general secretary R.B. Rai. â€œOnce again, we will try to bring all the Opposition parties in the hills together,â€� promised Rai.

12,BSF jawan arrested for murdering businessman,"NEW DELHI: The police have arrested a Border Security Force constable, Aman Deep, for the murder of a businessman. The latter was reportedly harassing his girlfriend.

Deepak Kapoorâ€™s body was discovered in the parking area of Talkatora Garden on Sunday night. Deep is a national-level cyclist. He even represented India in an international cycling event in Malaysia in 1999.

Investigations have revealed that Deep murdered Kapoor because he was blackmailing his girlfriend, Gurdeep Kaur, said the police. ""The two planned Kapoorâ€™s murder on Saturday after Kaur confided in Deep,"" deputy commissioner of police (New Delhi) Manoj Lall said.

According to him, the police got a clue after they discovered Kapoorâ€™s two-wheeler from the parking area. The victim had borrowed the vehicle from his friend to visit Paharganj on Sunday. The police found the victim also owned a Santro car.

On investigation the police came to know about Gurdeep Kaur who is national champion in kabaddi. On being interrogated, Kaur admitted to having conspired to kill Kapoor, the police said. She also allegedly disclosed Deepâ€™s role.

Deep also admitted his involvement, said the police. His confession to the police, however, will not be admissible as evidence in court. He confessed that Kaur was his girlfriend and on Saturday he had left his mobilephone with her.

In the evening when he tried to call her, Deep felt somebody was trying to disconnect the phone. He once again called Kaur and asked her to meet him at Talkatora Gardens. When she arrived there, Deep saw that she got off a Santro car.

Kaur told Deep her problems. The two decided to kill Kapoor, said the police. ""As planned, Kaur called Kapoor to Talkatora Gardens on Sunday evening. He was strangulated with an iron wire"" said a police official.

13,Illicit liquor seized at DDCA party,"NEW DELHI: The Delhi state excise department seized smuggled liquor from a high-profile private party, hosted by Delhi District Cricket Association (DDCA), on Sunday night. The party was being held at a farmhouse in Vasant Kunj.

The excise department seized bottles of smuggled foreign and Defence liquor from Rishineera farmhouse in Kakori. Farmhouse owner Sunil Kumar Bhagat was arrested and the DDCA authorities were booked for not procuring L-49 licence â€” mandatory for serving liquor at private parties. Officials said many former cricketers and city socialites were present in the party.

""Joint secretary of the DDCA Anil Jain had booked the farmhouse for a party. He did so without taking a licence from the excise department. Foreign liquor like Teachers Whisky and French wines, Cuvee Special and Beeje London, were being served at the party. We also seized bottles of Bacardi rum, Smirnoff and Kremlin vodka. They had been bought from the Defence canteen,"" said an official.

State excise department suffers huge losses on account of smuggled liquor. Officials said since liquor duty is low in neighbouring states, people often smuggle it into Delhi. Liquor sold at Defence canteen is also served illegally at parties.

""The excise duty on canteen liquor is ten times lower in Defence canteens than that sold in the government vends. The rebate is, however, only for Defence personnel. If civilians buy liquor from these canteens, it is illegal,"" said an official.

14,BJP blasts govt for rising crime rate in Surat,"GANDHINAGAR: Members of the Bharatiya Janata Party from Surat on Monday came down heavily on the government in the state assembly for deteriorating law and order situation in the diamond city and demanded stiff measures, including setting up of more police stations.

For the first time in the current session, the BJP members chose to raise voice over the matter. Surprisingly, the Congress members kept away from blasting the government for reasons best known to them. Barring a question from Dr Tushar Chaudhary, who represents Vyara in Surat district, none of the Congress members tried to corner the BJP government. Members were debating the issue on a calling-attention motion tabled by Dhirubhai Gajera about a dacoity committed in a textile unit within the GIDC industrial estate in Sachin, near Surat.

The BJP members alleged that crime graph in parts of Surat had gone up and the government had failed to take any effective steps to improve the situation. Gajera and two other members, Dhansukhbhai Patel and Bhavnaben Chapatwala, alleged that crime situation in Surat had worsened because of large number of labourers migrating from other states. Some mechanism should be worked out to keep a close watch on anti-social elements ruling the roost in industrial areas of the city, they said. Chapatwala demanded that government should set up more police stations in industrial areas of Surat to tackle the situation. Denying the charges of the BJP members, minister of state for home Amit Shah said more police stations would be set up if need be.

Referring to the dacoity incident, he said armed desperadoes had decamped with spare parts worth Rs 19,200 as per police records. Despite ministerâ€™s statement, Gajera said ground realities were totally different as thefts and other crimes had been reported in almost all police stations.

â€œItâ€™s a matter of serious concern for people of Surat which earns foreign exchange to the tune of Rs 35,000 crore per annum,â€� he said. Shah listed precautionary measures taken by the Surat police. Patrolling had been intensified in all parts of the city and anti-dacoity cell had become operational after Sachin incident. In all, 402 incidents of burglary, robbery and dacoity had been reported in Surat in the past two months, said the minister.
