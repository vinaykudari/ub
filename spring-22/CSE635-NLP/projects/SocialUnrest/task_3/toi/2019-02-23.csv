3,Absenteeism of govt doctors worries Speaker,"ranchi: the jharkhand speaker, inder singh namdhari, on friday took the problem of doctors being absent from health centres located in far-flung areas very seriously. this problem was brought up by the congress legislator, theodore kiro, about a lady doctor posted in bolwa in simdega, who went on leave soon after joining. kiro said she had been absent since september 2001, and that she was the only lady doctor posted there. hence, her prolonged absence was creating problems for rural women patients. the health minister, dr d k sarangi, replied that she was on medical leave since october 13, 2001. on this, the speaker remarked that doctors do not want to live in rural hospitals and with the help of civil surgeons, they also manage to get their salary regularly. this is a very serious matter and it ought to be checked, the speaker remarked. after this he asked the health minister to summon both the civil surgeon and the doctor concerned and find out if that lady doctor''s going on leave on medical grounds was justified. if not justified, she should be asked to go back to bolwa. the legislators'' concern for health and family welfare is also reflected in the 37 questions listed as starred questions. besides absenteeism, the legislators also brought up the problems of poor condition of buildings, lack of equipment, and other infrastructural support. sarangi, who has toured the state extensively and conducted many surprise checks, and even initiated punitive action against erring doctors, fielded the questions with well informed answers. he informed that allotments had already been made, and orders given for renovation of many referral hospitals and health centres. he also asked the legislators to contribute some funds from their annual development quota of funds for renovation of health centres in their respective areas.

4,Madhubani bandh total,"madhubani: a shocked madhubani observed a near-total bandh on friday to protest â€˜criminal administrative failureâ€™ in preventing a self-immolation bid by a shiv sena activist, kashi nath jha, on thursday despite prior information. surprisingly, the incident had taken place in the presence of a magistrate, police and a medical team ready with an ambulance. all shops remained closed and all modes of transport stayed off the road. only a few private vehicles, besides some rickshaws and cycles, were seen plying here and there. teaching in educational institutions was also affected. despite promulgation of section 144 in the town and deployment of forces at sensitive points, the police had to open two rounds of fire in the air to disperse a stone-pelting mob near shankar chowk here. later, towards noon, a group of agitators set the cables of telephone department on fire at shankar chowk. fire brigade was rushed to the spot to control the fire. situation in the town is tense. jha, reportedly a shiv sena activist, of bhatsimar village under the rajnagar police station, received about 90 per cent burn injuries while trying to immolate himself in the local municipal office compound on thursday to protest hike in holding tax. he, along with four others, was on a fast-unto-death since february 19 in front of the municipal office under the banner of nagar vikas parishad in protest against hike in the holding tax. meanwhile, district magistrate b rajendra, while briefing the press on friday, claimed that the victim is not kashi nath jha but one radha kant mishra, son of late tara kant mishra of bhatsimar village under the rajnagar police station, and was convicted in an idol theft case. he further said that radha kant mishra is a leprosy patient and also an accused in the killing his father. the dm, however, could not give any concrete evidence regarding his claim. the dm alleged that radha kant mishra alias kashi nath jha was set ablaze by some miscreants. he said that he had no information about this agitation for withdrawal of hike in the holding tax. when he came to know of it on thursday, he invited a delegation for discussion, which, however, did not turn up. doubts about the identity of the victim and of his background notwithstanding, the fact remains that kashi nath jha or radha kant mishra received 90 per cent burn injuries in presence of the police and magistrate and is presently struggling for life in the dmch. refuting the administrationâ€™s claim that the victim was set ablaze by some miscreants, eyewitness accounts say that petrol was poured over him by one of his accomplishes while he himself lighted the matchstick and set himself ablaze. and all this in presence of the magistrate on duty, id mandal, sdp (headquarters), officer-in-charge of the town police station and a doctor.

17,"Conmen use rajmah to trap victims, arrested","new delhi: can one make loads of money from fifty beans? no one can be blamed for thinking that it was not possible. but five tricksters managed to cheat hundreds of businessmen of crores of rupees using only the beans. according to the police, the cheats would first identify likely victims, usually reasonably well to do businessmen. a â€˜chanceâ€™ meeting would be arranged with one of the cheats who during casual conversation would make a lucrative offer to the victim. over the next few meetings the victim would be told that a wealthy businessman was willing to make large investments in his business. a meeting between the victim and the businessman would then be arranged. during this meeting the businessman would talk big. â€˜â€˜usually the cheat pretending to be the businessman would during the meeting make and receive payments worth several crores over the phone,â€™â€™ explained a policeman. â€œhe would then ask his assistant to arrange for the money. the assistant would then bring forth wads of notes and place them in a bag. the money was then supposedly sent to various business associates,â€™â€™ he added. what the victim would not realise is that the wads of notes were actually just wads of plain paper with a single currency note placed on the top and bottom. once sufficiently convinced about the businessmanâ€™s monetary status, the victim would be invited to a peculiar game. the businessmanâ€™s associates would place fifty beans in front of him in piles of forty, four, three, two and one. the victim would be asked to pick some beans up from the pile of forty. the businessman would then bet an outrageous amount on guessing whether there were odd or even number of beans left. predictably, the businessman would lose a huge sum. â€˜â€˜once hooked after the initial win the victim would come back to play with more money, thinking it was a win win situation. however, the next time they played, the victim would find himself lighter by several lakh rupees. despite having lost, the victimâ€™s would never approach the police. after all they had lost it in gambling which is illegal,â€™â€™ said a policeman. the ploy was so successful that the cheats kept at it for over five years, making crores of rupees. their luck, however, ran out on thursday, when the police, working on a tip off, raided their den. the five accused were later identified as gulzar, bache singh, bhuwan chand, madan singh and vikas bisht. police officials said they recovered the wads of paper which the cheats used to lure their victims.

19,A war cry against the political class,"bangalore: besides a working woman, my domestic help is a middle-aged mother, wife, daughter and daughter-in-law. in the two years of my association with her, i watch with growing admiration how she packs in the roles, all of them onerous, day after day. she dare not think of shirking her responsibilities because of the deleterious effect it can have on her home so gingerly placed between calm and turmoil, or the many mouths she must feed. she is frail, her eyes anaemic and pools of grief, i wonder where she musters the nerve to keep ticking non-stop. at the end of the day, a smile lingers on her weary face. but i know this is a facade, just a valiant effort to hide her sorrows. it was as if her life was designed to stay on the dark side always. the worst was when her firstborn, a daughter, succumbed to blood cancer at age 13, some years ago. treatment was unaffordable, and the mother just stood by watching her daughter suffer and die. that incident has taken a toll on her, but she was not allowed the time or space to even grieve for her daughter... she had to pick herself up and go on for the sake of the rest of her family. now her 10-year-old son suffers from a mysterious kidney disease. and it is endless visits to the government hospital, where she is up against red tape, bribes, impatient and rude doctors --all of which she is not savvy enough to handle. there is a sense of deja vu. that iron will to take life by the jugular in the most excruciating circumstances, is fast evaporating. what shocks me is her resignation. she is not complaining. she will not speak up against the injustice heaped on her by an apathetic system that only takes, never gives. never mind, if the hungry power-seekers are preying on her. she simply complies. that is her nemesis. then there is my outside help. the same story of compliance and resignation to his fate. old, his wobbly legs are barely able to carry him. but he can scarce entertain the thought of retirement. his earnings are essential to keep the large family running. a widowed daughter with three children, a sick wife, the rent for their crammed room, the money for scant daily rations... the duo are not cases in isolation. they are a sample of india''s majority. the electorate. incredibly trusting, expecting with each passing election, nothing except a better quality of life and government largesse that should legitimately be theirs. elections come and go. they give selflessly, but nothing changes. while self-serving leaders who come soliciting votes fatten themselves on the poor. they promise them the moon and more. only till votes are cast. then the self-appointed caretakers of the masses up and out, just as suddenly as they landed from nowhere laden with enticements. the poor feel cheated, cast aside. yet they are resigned to their lot, disturbingly so. people power can move mountains, unseat governments, bring undeserving leaders on their knees. it can change the face of a nation, to the utopian face of dreams. it''s still not late to raise a war cry against a depraved political class.
