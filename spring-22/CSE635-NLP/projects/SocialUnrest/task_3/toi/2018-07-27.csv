0,"No talks till terrorism stops, RSS tells govt","new delhi: after having welcomed the agra summit at national executive and later defending the government over the summit's failure, the rss now has made it official that the vajpayee government should not engage in talks with pakistan till it stops cross-border terrorism. indeed, the rss has gone a step further beyond its stated position on vajpayee's return visit to pakistan. ``if the present situation prevails in pakistan, vajpayee should not make the visit. but we do not know whether the present dispensation will continue,'' rss spokesman m g vaidya had said earlier. now, there is no ambiguity. in a press statement, rss sarkaryavah (general secretary) mohan bhagwat hit out at the government, ``it pains us to see the government is unable to protect the life of its citizens from murderous attacks of a handful of terrorists.'' expressing concern at the killings of amarnath pilgrims, the rss has stated these terrorist activites are only aimed at the ``completion of an unfinished agenda of partition.'' the rss in its statement categorically said it does not want the government to continue its peace initiative. it demandded that both the central and state governments ``out down the insurgent terrorism with a heavy hand'', and that so long as pakistan ``does not withdraw its support to nefarious secessionist activities in our country'', the vajpayee government need not engage itself in any dialogue ``with that rogue country''. no concession, no goodwill gesture would satisfy ``pakistan's appetite for grabbing kashmir'', it said. the rss apparently has come in for attack from within for bending over backwards to accomodate the government's position on kashmir and the summit. some rss leaders were of the view that the government should have called off the summit once president musharraf changed his tone before the summit and announced his decision to invite hurriyat leaders. even after the summit's failure, the rss did not attack the government for inviting the general. now, a groundswell of anger among the rss rank and file at a red carpet welcome to the author of kargil war appears to have prompted the sangh leadership to somehow dissociate itself from the government's attempts at peace-making.

""this clause would help landlords to evict tenants on issuing a 15 days notice according to section 106 of the act of 1982,"" said trivedi. members of the joint committee of west bengal trade bodies have decided to go on a 24 hour strike on august 1 if no action is taken by the government. according to mahesh kumar singhania, chairman federation of west bengal trade associations a fifteen page memorandum has been submitted to review certain clauses in the new act.

2,Time limit for appeals not hard and fast rule: SC,"new delhi: courts should adopt a liberal a course of action while dealing with appeals which are filed a few days after the time limit prescribed under the limitation act, the supreme court has ruled. restoring an appeal dismissed by a maharashtra court for a delay of a mere seven days, a bench of justice s s m quadri and justice s n phukan said ""in exercise of discretion under section 5 of the limitation act, the courts should adopt a pragmatic approach."" ""a distinction must be made between a case where the delay was inordinate and a case where the delay was of a few days,"" it said in a recent judgement. ""whereas in the former case, the consideration of prejudice to the other side will be a relevant factor so the case calls for a more cautious approach but in the latter case (where the appeal is delayed by a few days) no such consideration may arise and such a case deserves a liberal approach,"" the court said. the bench said the court has to exercise the discretion on the facts of each case keeping in mind that in construing the expression ""sufficient cause"", the principle of advancing substantial justice was of prime importance. referring to the bombay high court order upholding the dismissal of the case, the bench said ""the high court in exercising its jurisdiction under section 115 failed to correct the jurisdictional error of the appellate court.""

3,SC notice to govt on polygamy among Muslims,"new delhi: the supreme court on friday issued notice to solicitor general of india on a petition filed by a divorced musim woman seeking ban on polygamy prevalent in the community and divorce by way of triple talaq. terming the issue raised by the petition as of ""great importance"", a bench comprising justice k t thomas and justice s n variava directed petitioner's counsel lily thomas to serve the notice on solicitor general harish salve. the court had earlier issued notices to the union government and husband of the petitioner, julekhabi, who has also sought quashing of her talaqnama. the petitioner had contended that the hindu community constituting the majority was governed by the hindu marriage act, 1955, which prohibits polygamy and extra-judicial divorce. ""therefore the custom and usage of polygamy and extra-judicial divorce allowed to be practised by muslims is a denial of equality, personal liberty and human rights guaranteed to all citizens by articles 14, 15 and 21 of the constitution,"" the petitioner, who had married one fazal in 1989 at the age of 20, said. describing herself as a direct casualty of polygamy, julekhabi submitted that she refused to stay with her husband when he married another woman in 1991. the petitioner said once the talaqnama was granted, fazal moved for cancellation of grant of maintenance of rs 400 per month being given to her from 1993. the madhya pradesh high court allowed the husband's application. as petition seeking a court order for restoration of maintenance was pending before the apex court since 1999, julekha contended that she was, at present, living in a state of penury. drawing the court's attention to the new development of telegraphic talaq as published in a newspaper, the petitioner said it would put lives of several muslim women in jeopardy. among other things the petitioner has sought issuance of a writ under article 32 of the constitution ""declaring that polygamy practised by muslim community is illegal, unconstitutional and void to be simultaneously substituted by monogamy."" seeking equality with muslim men, the petitioner requested the court to declare that ""dissolution of marriage under muslim marriage act, 1939, can be invoked equally by either spouse."" it also requested the court to strike down provisions relating to ""talaq, ila, zihar, lian and khula.

4,Retain DEPB export incentive scheme: Exporters,"new delhi: expressing concern over the government's proposal to phase out duty entitlement pass book scheme (depb), exporters on friday demanded that it be retained for accelerating exports, while the government said that it would be replaced by a flexible drawback scheme (fds). ""considering the benefit accruing to exporters from the depb scheme we will like it to be retained with it being made clear that availing benefit under it could invite countervailing duty by the importing countries,"" they said. speaking in a seminar on ""export incentives in india and the wto agreement,"" they said it should be made known to the business community that the scheme was countervailable under wto provisions. once that happens the option would be before them to avail benefit under the scheme or forgo it, they added. ajay sahai, joint director general of foreign trade, said that under article 25.2 of the wto agreement on subsidies and countervailing measures (scm), the scheme would have to be notified as permissible because if wto decides ""it is prohibited, the scheme goes then and there."" he said that the government wanted to phase it out by march 2002 ""subject to certain conditions"" and these included putting in place a fds and accounting for the sales tax regime which at present was not uniform in all states. a paper in this regard had already been prepared by the concerned committee and a final decision was awaited. indian council for research on international economic relations' (icrier) anwarul hoda said that wto provisions might not be the sole reason for the proposed withdrawal of the scheme. hoda said that one reason could be the fiscal difficulties faced by the centre. sahai said that in the past, too, schemes had been done away with as central board of direct taxes wanted to expand its revenue base. depb had been by far the most popular scheme with the exporters and more than rs 5,000 crore had been exempted as duty under it. though under the advance licence scheme the figure was rs 15,000 crore, depb was covering around one-third of the total exports. icrier's rajeev ahuja said that the scheme had been countervailed by some of india's trading partners more for its form than its spirit. the scheme gave credit for the duties or taxes paid on the inputs used in exports, which was not considered a subsidy under the scm agreement. however, european union and the us had countervailed depb scheme for the manner in which it operated. in their calculation of cvds they had not just taken ""excess"" benefit given on exports but considered the entire benefit under depb. they disregarded the fact that some of the benefit was in principle allowed under the scm agreement. it was countervailable if not all inputs on which refund was claimed were imported and some were indigenous. the scheme could be made non-countervailable by affecting necessary changes in its form, he added. under depb an exporter can avail credit for import of raw materials, intermediates, components, parts and packaging material at a rate which is a certain percentage of free on board (fob) value of exports.

8,CMC swoop leads to skull exporter's arrest,"kolkata: a house off cit road, found stacked with human body parts including skeletons, skulls and bones on thursday, led to the arrest of 50-year-old vinesh aron, who is said to be from chandigarh. surprisingly, aron has been carrying on the illegal trade for at least a decade-and-a-half, rode a chauffeur-driven maruti esteem and flaunted a panasonic cell phone, but was never reported. challans recovered from the single-storeyed house revealed that he was not only engaged in shipping the body parts to places as diverse as karachi and new york. even more surprisingly, aron was running the business openly enough. he had employed dozens of people including three women who looked after 'billing and accounts'. the kitchen in the house was used to cook lunch for all of them and the vat used regularly to boil the bones and skulls. several workers were engaged in polishing the bones on thursday when a team from the calcutta municipal corporation, led by mmic (health) javed khan, swooped down on the nondescript house following a complaint of foul smell emanating from the building. a large number of skulls were being dried on the roof, visible from at least two adjoining buildings. residents of a neighbouring flat on the third floor claimed that they had seen the activities and the skulls ever since they moved in two years ago. but somehow nobody in the neighbourhood thought of reporting this. the small office had three computers and a fax machine. skeletons of all sizes and shapes, wrapped in transparent plastic, hung from hooks on the walls. two almirahs stocked smaller bones and even the loft was full of bones, all packed in plastic. aron tried to bluster his way out after being contacted over his cell phone. he offered to reach within the next 20 minutes, arrived an hour later and declared that he was carrying out a legitimate business. the 5'9'' tall aron, dressed casually and nursing a paunch, fished out a trade license, which was found to have lapsed in march. police said that the trade in human bodies was banned in the mid-1980. in any case, cmc officials pointed out, the license allowed him to trade in ""models of human anatomy"" and not parts of the human body.

9,Rajkumar's farmhouse is hauntingly deserted,"gajanur: the palatial farmhouse at gajanur is deserted now. twelve months ago, the house was virtually besieged by gun-toting security personnel, curious onlookers and shocked villagers who had seen brigand veerappan in action after a three-year hiatus. now manned by a police officer ofthe assistant sub-inspector's rank with help from a guard of the tamil nadu constabulary, the farmhouse is hauntingly peopled by vacuum. people in the village are waiting for the turn of kannada superstar rajkumar. but the ghost of the july 30 abduction seems to have kept the matinee idol off from the village. shraavanamaasa, an auspiciousmonth in the hindu calendar, sees the rajkumar family pitching camp in itsancestral village and offering prayers at temples. it had been an annual ritual till last year. and this year, the gajanur villagers are greatly disappointed that rajkumar has so far not chosen to keep date with the village deities. sources in the rajkumar family claimed that the actor had sought some changes in the house in tune with vaastu. rajkumar has not beenable to visit the village as the repair work is still on, they said. rajkumar had spent a gruelling 108 days in the jungle before being set free in november. three others were also kidnapped along with the actor. nagaraj, cousin of rajkumar, is more positive. ``annavru had instructed us to shift household articles from the farmhouse (from where he was kidnapped) to the newly built house. we'll complete this during theshraavanamaasa.'' the new house is bang opposite the farmhouse.``rajkumar will soon come here and supervise the shifting of the house.'' the change in calendar does not hold out any promise for the villagers who very well know that veerappan holds, and continues to hold, both the karnataka and tamil nadu governments to ransom and remains elusive. madaiah, a villager, said: ``veerappan still calls the shots from the forest.'' those who had hoped that the special task force will close in on veerappan soon after the release of rajkumar have been let down. the priest of the hanuman temple in the village, who had pledged to perform a special puja on the day rajkumar was set free from the brigand's clutches, is disillusioned. ``i never thought veerappan's arrest will be delayed for so many months. it may never come through now.'' any talk of rajkumar landing in gajanur sends the villagers' excitement soaring. and the policemen,who were almost lynched by angry mobs soon after the kidnap, get jittery before flashing a benign smile. but the nightmare of the eponymous farmhouse refuses to fade away.

11,Govt says it can make rules to validate Sondhi's sacking,"new delhi: the government defended its stand on the sacking of indian council for social science research chairman m l sondhi in the high court. it said that even if there was no rule under which the sondhi was sacked, it could always create a new one to validate the dismissal. sondhi's petition challenging the dismissal had come up for hearing before justice vikramjit sen on friday. sondhi was removed from his post on july 18. the deposed icssr chairman contended that there was no rule in the memorandum of constitution of the council under which he was removed. arguing on behalf of sondhi, former union law minister and senior advocate shanti bhushan contended the former icssr chairman was ``unceremoniously removed as he was opposed to hindutva agenda'' which was being pushed by the ruling bjp-government into the seminars and research activity undertaken by the council. declining to stay the government's order, the judge asked the government to maintain status quo on the council and reply to sondhi's allegation by august 9. appearing on behalf of the government, additional solicitor general mukul rohtagi told the court that the icssr was not covered by any act or provision of constitution, but was a totally government-created and funded society under the societies registration act, 1860. the asg said the petitioner was unnecessarily harping on the fact that there was no rule under which his chairmanship, supposed to be lasting for a fixed term of three years, was withdrawn. ``so what we forgot to put that clause, that it (the chairmanship) can not be withdrawn. nothing stops us from putting it now,'' rohtagi argued. ``he cannot claim the post back, just because we forgot to put that clause. in this case i (the government) is the master, i can make new rules if they did not exist. especially when i am not governed (in this matter) by any statute,'' rohtagi argued. when it comes to appointments, rohtagi said the status of icssr is not at par with, say, delhi university where the government has power to appoint a vice-chancellor, but cannot withdraw him, because his post is protected under the statutes of the delhi university act. ``if the government has the power to nominate, it has the power to withdraw also, because it is a non-statutory organisation and there is no supervening statute to restrain the government from doing so,'' the asg said. ``the council's bye-laws are made by us (the government), where is the fetter? it is our laws and we can change them,'' the asg said. in his petition filed before the court, sondhi has contended that when he ``strongly resisted the government's attempt to make icssr as an institution subservient to its political agenda'' and the government started looking for ways of replacing him with ``some other pliable chairman who is appreciative of its partisan agenda.'' under the rules a chairman can only be removed in case of death, resignation, becoming unsound in mind or insolvent, conviction in an offence involving moral turpitude or failure to attend three consecutive meetings of the council without proper leave. sondhi said the allegation levelled in government's letter of march 13 were not only false and baseless but also did not involve any charge of moral turpitude. ``the order of the government is bad in law as it was passed without jurisdiction as it had no powers to withdraw the nomination before a period of three years,'' sondhi claimed. sondhi said there was no provision to appoint a ``temporary chairman'' under the council rules. the sitting chairman could continue till new one takes charge.

12,JD(S) slams Krishna govt on drought,"raichur: janata dal (secular) leader and former deputy chief minister siddaramaiah on thursday criticised the state government for its ""abject failure"" in sending a report on the drought situation to the union government. he told reporters: ``emaciated cattle have been left to fend for themselves, labourers are fleeing the barren land to eke out a living and farmers are resorting to suicide unable to face the harsh reality. but the government is yet to wake up to the tragedy unfolding in the state.'' he recalled that the janata dal government had in 1995-96 kicked off many development works for farmers and interest on crop loans was written off to ease their burden. ``the farmers, who are already reeling under the onslaught of general agreement on trade and tariffs and the world trade organisation rules, have now been subjected to drought and the government is not offering any help.'' siddaramaiah castigated four union ministers from karnataka -- including dhananjaya kumar and ananth kumar -- and wondered whether they were doing anything in real terms to mitigate the sufferings of farmers. ``instead of bailing out the farmers, the state government has increased power tariff. the hike should be kept in abeyance. the janata dal (secular) will launch an agitation if the government fails to convert short-term loans into long-term ones and write off interest on crop loan.'' earlier, a team of janata dal (secular) functionaries studied drought situation at jambaladinni village in raichur taluk. party leaders b.g. patil, mahadevappa, muniyappa muddappa, gangadhar nayak and shaik rizwan accompanied siddaramaiah.

15,Doctors strike on; govt yet to respond,"bangalore: members of the karnataka state junior doctors' association (ksjda) continued their strike for the fifth day. yet, the association hasn't managed to evoke any response from the government. medical services in hubli, davangere, mysore, bellary, gulbarga and bangalore continued to be affected on friday, but the unrelenting doctors intensified their stand and representatives from various districts have come to bangalore to participate in the strike. the protesting doctors organised a rally and submitted a memorandum to the hospital superintendent, urging him to apprise the higher authorities of the problems. doctors assembled at victoria hospital and formed a human chain. ksjda president dr vijay kumar said an effigy will be burnt on saturday as part of the stepped-up agitation. ``we request the rajiv gandhi university of health sciences (rguhs) v-c and minister for medical education nafees fazal to resolve the medical college issue and the examination pattern amicably.'' meanwhile, in a point-by-point reply to the doctors' demand, a copy of which was circulated, rguhs registrar dr k.m. srinivasa gowda said the university is taking added efforts to remove all possibilities of bias, prejudice and malpractice in examinations. the ksjda, however, feels the rguhs's reply is arbitrary and inconclusive. ``we urge the authorities to hold a thorough discussion with ksjda. let them advance the academic council meet scheduled on august 1 to an earlier date. we do not wish to further inconvenience millions of patients in the state as we are already on a strike agenda,'' the members said. furthermore, they urged the director of medical education and the rguhs to announce the cet seat matrix for post-graduation entrance counselling, as followed in other states. ksjda also plans to hold a medical bandh soon.

19,All-party panel makes cosmetic changes to information bill,"new delhi: there is an all-party consensus on limiting citizens' right to information as much as possible. this is evident from the parliamentary standing committee's clearance of the ironically named `freedom of information bill, 2000.' the proposed legislation is extremely protective of state secrecy and the all-party panel cleared it with just mild recommendations to liberalise the provisions. sections of the bill that have been cleared without any reservations include section eight which forbids any disclosure of any information that might affect india's sovereignty, integrity, security, scientific or economic interest, conduct of international relations, union-state relations, internal file notings of ministers or officials and suchlike. section nine empowers a disclosure officer to reject any request if the information sought involves a ``disproportionate diversion of the resources of a public authority''. the committee just replaced the word ``disproportionate'' with ``unreasonable'' and cleared this section. there are other such minor changes to the bill suggested by the all-party panel. effectively, it has cleared a bill which empowers the state keeping anything it wants under wraps in, ironically, the name of freedom of information. votories of citizens' rights from the left and the left-of-centre parties and persons such as lm singhvi and kuldip nayar were on the panel. other signatories to the report include panel chairman pranab mukherjee, sanghpriya gautam, c.m.ibrahim, joyasree mahanta, hansraj bharadwaj, n.janardhana reddy, beni prasad verma and raghuvansh prasad singh. the bill was referred to the 45-member panel (30 from the lok sabha and 15 from the rajya sabha) last september (it was tabled in the lok sabha two months before that) for scrutiny. their let-it-pass report has been now tabled in both houses. a number of influential figures had officially lobbied with the panel to considerably liberalise the bill ^ madhav godbole, a.g.noorani and manubhai shah from the commonwealth human rights initiative, as also ex-cabinet secretary b.g.deshmukh, press council of india chief p.b.sawant and heads of rajasthan's mazdoor kisan shakti sangathan, who've waged a relentless grassroots campaign on the issue there. this has had some effect; the committee report says it feels ``many of the important suggestions of the (above) experts/organisations have not been covered in the bill..(we), therefore, recommend that the government consider these views..and incorporate them in the bill to make it comprehensive.""

20,Health minister caught up in transfers,"bangalore: health and family welfare minister a.b. maalaka raddy on friday expressed his helplessness in carrying out the day-to-day administration of the state government due to frequent interference by the legislators. making a statement on the issue raised by a.h. shivayogi swamy (bjp) of a gynaeocologist in chikkaballapur government hospital who refused to conduct a delivery when the woman refused to pay a bribe of rs 4,000, raddy said all his time and energy was being spent in postings, transfers and taking disciplinary action. raddy said out of 25 files he receives per day, 15 files pertain to transfers. about five files are about disciplinary action. ``you can imagine how i am functioning. i am pulverised from doing anything good and concrete. i do not know how to move ahead. i am unable to do anything meaningful to cleanse and tone up the administrative machinery,'' he added. narrating the case, swamy said the woman was an advanced stage of her pregnancy and was brought to chikkaballapur government hospital on wednesday. at this stage the gynaecologist sent word through a nurse to the family members to pay rs 4,000 to take up the case. the woman had no option but to go to mission hospital,'' swamy explained and sought action against the erring gynaecologist. complimenting swamy for raising the issue, raddy said: ``this morning two legislators came to speak to me on behalf of an official who was caught by lok ayukta for accepting bribe,'' he added. m.c.nanaiah (jd) demanded action against the two legislators favouring the corrupt officials on the ground that they are abettors of the crime. ``in the background of your helplessness, do you propose to resign so as to make it an eye-opener and send a strong message to the chief minister?'' nanaiah asked. raddy, however, parried the question and said: ``nanaiah may be technically right. but i will not run away.'' he assured swamy of initiating stringent action against the gynaecologist and the nurse.

21,Plan to revive film development corporation,"bangalore: information minister b.k. chandrashekar told the legislative council on friday that the state government was finding out ways and means to retain the kanteerava studio and karnataka film industries development corporation (kfidc) and make it financially viable. in his reply to a question by mukhya mantri chandru (bjp), chandrashekar said the government has received a report from padmanabha committee which has recommended the closure of kfidc. ``but it is not mandatory on the part of the government to accept all the recommendations in toto,'' he added. explaining the difficulty in running the two institutions, the government will incur an expenditure to the tune of rs 30 lakh to rs 40 lakh if it offers the golden hand-shake to the employees. ``the suggestion given by the members to direct all the government department to shoot documentaries only through kfidc and kanteerava will be positively considered,'' he added. chandru urged the government to divert five per cent entertainment tax towards these two institutions as in andhra pradesh.

22,Rajya Sabha approves President's rule in Manipur,"new delhi: rajya sabha approved the imposition of president's rule in manipur on friday setting the stage for dissolution of the state assembly and a spell of president's rule. saying the government would not like to order fresh elections in the current politically volatile situation union home minister l k advani referred to the situation that had developed in the state after the extension of the ceasefire. the debate in the house saw former negotiator for the naga talks swaraj kaushal making an impassioned plea for the government to reconsider its decision to review the ceasefire extension saying there was no cause for alarm in manipur. while the resolution in support of the president's rule was passed with near unanimity amongst the political parties, the nda was severely criticised for being the originator of the political instability with several parties laying the blame on the samata-bjp tussle for power. in his reply to the debate, union home minister l k advani switched his ministerial hat for that of party leader to defend the role and committment of his party. the bjp did not form the government though it could have at any time and the party was committed to the territorial integrity of manipur he said. while the discussion was supposed to be limited to the vote on the motion, this small technical detail did not prevent political parties from raising what was of particular interest to them. therefore while rjd mp ram deo bhandari took the opportunity to criticise the attempt to use article 356 in bihar, it provided an excellent platform for the main rivals of tamil nadu to ventilate their feelings. dmk mp viduthalai virumbi demanded the dismissal of the jayalalitha government for violation of human rights, federal polity, press freedom and manipulation of the electronic media. while virumbi was able to relate the issue to the matter under discussion in some manner, newly elected aiadmk mp, p g narayana launched into a frontal attack against the dmk, causing some indulgent laughter and forcing the chairperson to curtail his speech. interestingly some parties including the rjd and cpi also demanded an amendment of the anti-defection to prevent such large scale defections that destabilised polity. the cpm, whose mp sarla maheshwari launched the sharpest attack, opposed the use of article 356, though its members sparred with the union home minister on whether it was at all possible to dissolve the house without imposition of president's rule.
