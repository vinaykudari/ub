0,Goads farmers to think global,"pune: calling upon farmers to unite against 'draconian recommendations of the world trade organisation (wto),' nationalist congress party (ncp) president sharad pawar on wednesday appealed to the central government to give protection to domestic agriculture for a few years to provide farmers with a level playing field with global competitors. addressing a gathering of farmers at a convention organised by the venkateshwara hatcheries group, mr pawar said the central government, along with the states, should immediately take steps to prevent the dumping of agricultural products from foreign countries. ""just because india is a member of the wto agreement, it does not mean the government must allow all imports without any duty,"" he thundered. the government should levy a heavy duty on horticultural import to prevent dumping, he added. ""today the milk and milk-processing industry of india are protected because of the high premium on the import of such items. the local farmer would die in the face of heavy dumping of agricultural products from foreign countries,"" he said. cheaper chicken the price of chicken will fall drastically by november. venkateshwara hatcheries (vh) will set up retail outlets in mumbai, pune, nasik and hyderabad, where chicken will be sold directly to consumers, eliminating the middlemen. ""we will add a margin of rs 5 per kg for the wholesale and rs 9 per kg for the retail business, on the farmer's cost of production of rs 32 per kg,"" said anuradha desai, chairperson, vh group, adding, ""this way, the consumer will pay between rs 34- 40 per kg, instead of rs 60-70 per kg he pays today.""

1,Chief minister stops shoppers' sops,"hyderabad: intervention by chief minister chandrababu naidu and strong resistance by sales tax officials against tax concessions proposed by the tourism department have saved the state exchequer over rs 160 crore. the tourism department had announced that companies which participate in the great shopping mall, commencing from october 13, would get complete sales tax exemption on the goods they sell during the month-long extravaganza. the tourism officials had reportedly made this announcement without taking any formal approval from the government or consulting the sales tax department. however, sensing the potential for revenue loss that such a grand gesture would entail, officials of the sales tax department took the matter to naidu and the ministers concerned. sources say that some shrewd businessmen, including a few automobile dealers, had whispered suggestions to their customers to postpone purchasing two-wheelers now and buy them instead during the shopping festival to take advantage of the juicy tax break. in response to the complaint from the sales tax department, naidu called a meeting with the ministers and officials concerned to thrash out the issue. it is learnt that chandrababu naidu had expressed his displeasure, particularly with the tourism secretary, about the announcement made by the tourism department, without obtaining prior concurrence from the government. the promise of tourism officials would contradict the uniform floor rates regime introduced by the union government and go against the spirit of the taxation system, he is reported to have said. however, after a series of meetings, the government agreed to give concessions on about a dozen items, including electronics, garments and household appliances, but excluded automobiles and liquor from the purview of tax exemption, which would be a drain on the government exchequer.

2,Cong may engineer defections for polls,"kolkata: elections to five rajya sabha seats from west bengal in 2002 may provide an opportunity for the pradesh congress to engineer defections in trinamul congress. and the trinamul achilles' heel once again could be kolkata mayor subrata mukherjee. the pradesh congress, however, strongly denies having made contact with mukherjee or for that matter with any other trinamul leader on this issue, as reported in a section of the media. there is no basis for these reports. we have formally denied making any contact with trinamul leaders on this issue, pcc president pranab mukherjee told tnn. the man in the hot seat, kolkata mayor subrata mukherjee, also denied having opened any discussion with the congress on his rajya sabha nomination. i have had no discussion with the congress on this, subrata mukherjee said. the mayor went on to add that warring groups in pradesh congress were trying to vitiate the political atmosphere. the trinamul camp seems not so worried about the prospect of a large scale defection over rajya sabha nominations. one can safely rule out trinamul congress mlas deserting mamata banerjee. yes there are a few congressmen who would not mind crossing over. but they are not sufficient to make the numbers, said trinamul crisis manager partha chatterjee. at stake are five rajya sabha seats that are up for grabs in 2002. while the trinamul has 60 mla in the house, the congress strength stands at 26. four independent mlas are with the congress. if congress and trinamul revive the now defunct alliance, with 90 votes in their favour, two rajya sabha seats can be won as each seat calls for at least 43 first preferential votes. if there is no alliance between the two parties, the trinamul, with its 60 seats is always assured of a rajya sabha berth. it is here that the congress can play the defection game. if it can make 13 trinamul mlas vote for the party, a congress candidate can win a rajya sabha seat. if the congress can break the trinamul legislature party, it will emerge as a second largest party in the house and claim the office of leader of opposition, now held by pankaj banerjee. the post of opposition chief whip will also be up for grabs. the stakes are indeed high for the congress. privately, pradesh leaders will not be averse to engineer such a scenario and are pretty confident that the trinamul will eventually break. in short term, our aim is to break the trinamul and emerge as the second largest party, taking on the cpm, said a pradesh congress leader. we cannot be seen as a party out to weaken the trinamul as that will provide our opponents with a weapon to brand us as cpm's b-team, goes the current strategic thinking in pcc.

3,Keshubhai's exit spoils Cong party,"ahmedabad: ""narendra modi...uhh...um... i wish him well,""... and former chief minister dilip parikh breaks into a mischievous laughter. but if there is anyone who almost condoled the exit of keshubhai patel, it is gujarat pradesh congress committee chief amarsinh chaudhary. he reacts to the changing political scenario with a long sigh and says: ""we have lost a good worker."" no, chaudhary is not talking about the irreplaceable loss of madhavrao scindia, but of keshubhai patel. he makes no bones about the fact that he met keshubhai at gujarat bhavan in delhi on tuesday and ""shared his grief"", so to speak. ""he was helping us indirectly,"" chaudhary admits. and he is not alone in this testimony. many in the congress toe a similar line, like ahmedabad standing committee chairman badruddin shaikh, who unabashedly said in a grave note: ""hamara ek worker shaheed ho gaya (the congress has lost a good worker)."" that modi is here to cook their goose is slowly sinking in with the congress. they are already seeing the cm's chair, which had appeared to have inched toward them, rudely move away. like the bureaucracy, the congress is on guard. ""till now, it was a case of less work and good results, but now things will be different,"" says senior congressman j.v. momin. also watching the nail-biting finish to the patel-modi match was the shankersinh vaghela group, which had sought deliverance from modi in the rashtriya janata party and will now face him as cm. newly-elected congress mp madhusudan mistry encapsulates the bjp's most 'organised' organiser: ""he has been issued a mandate to win the forthcoming elections and he will achieve this by hook or crook."" mistry fears ""extra-constitutional licences"" being given to the rss' outfits, increasing violence and receding development in the days to come. ""he can go to any extent to achieve his target, and will blatantly use the whole government machinery in this direction till the polls,"" mistry alleges, adding that the only way out for the congress is to defeat him in the byelection meant to keep him in the cm's chair.

9,Oppn interested political mileage: Laloo,"patna: faced with severe criticism on the growing number of kidnappings in bihar, the state government has ordered the police to launch a drive to identify gangs engaged in kidnapping. while a largescale kidnapping cases, including those of doctors, businessmen and children, are being reported, the government and police faced popular anger at muzaffarpur following the recovery of the body of an abducted four-year-old son of a bank employee that led to police firing claiming seven lives and injury to several others. rjd chief laloo prasad yadav said the government would like a sitting judge of the patna high court to head the judicial commission to probe the muzaffarpur episode. the commission will also look into lapses of the state government, he added. otherwise, rjd chief laloo prasad yadav said the police has been asked to identify the gangs, their operational areas and carry out continuous raids on the hideouts of the identified kidnapping gangs. a special task force is being constituted for this purpose, he said on friday. according to him, quite a few new kidnapping gangs consisting of youngsters had come up. the police will monitor assets being made and money being collected by the kidnapping gang, asserted laloo, insisting that there would be an all-out war against kidnapping gangs. on the kidnapping of a child in bhagalpur close on the heels of the muzaffarpur incident, he suspected a conspiracy behind the incident to defame the government. kidnappings take place in every state. in bihar, the number of kidnappings actually is much less than other states. here the police has reacted in such crimes and also recovered kidnapped persons. in purnia, it recovered two kidnapped busnessmen. even in muzaffarpur, the district police acted and were close to nabbing the kidnappers, he claimed. laloo, however, added that there was a need to improve policing in the state. there has been and still is the need to improve the police system, he maintaind, adding that the government was open to suggestions from the opposition members on curbing kidnapping incidents. but the opposition is more interested in trying to gain political mileage over the brutal murder of golu at muzaffarpur and consequential violence, he insisted.

10,HC raps govt on panchayat jamboree,"patna: in a significant verdict, the patna high court on friday quashed the government order requisitioning private school buildings for the october 2 convention of newly elected panchayat members in patna. it held categorically that the state government's move to organise the state-level convention of the members of the three tiers of panchayati raj in patna is bad in law and unconstitutional. a division bench comprising the chief justice r s dhavan and justice s k singh observed that calling the panchayats to the state capital is a bad way of doing the things. it shows that decentralisation of power has not happened and the state has beckoned the panchayats to its fold. this is baiting of panchayats and calling its representatives to a glorified state party at the expense of public money, the bench added. the bench held that education cannot come to a halt for political rallies and political conventions. the act is not only arbitrary but crude and lacking sensibility. the court maintained that let no one in power take so much credit by advertising the newly formed local-self government. the judgment was delivered on a writ petition of the association of independent schools challenging the government order for requisitioning the private school buildings from september 29 to october 3. the state's plea was that about two lakh panchayat members had to be accommodated during the convention and it had no alternative but to requisition the private school buildings as well. the court quashed the requisition order of patna district magistrate and the secretary, secondary education. the bench held that the requisition was illegal and unconstitutional affecting some fundamental rights of the students, the teachers and the owners of the schools. the court held valid the plea of the petitioners that the order was tantamount to criminal trespass and lurking house trespass. this verdict will have far reaching consequences as the bench held in clear terms that the action to requisition schools for accommodation and closure of educational institutions as a consequence has no sanction of law. the court noted with serious concern that even the university examinations for different faculties had been postponed due to the convention. the bench held that the panchayat as an institution was not subordinate to state government. any orientation to panchayats need be taken within the districts where they operate. in the present case the state has beckoned the panchayats to its fold. with this the very essence of the local self government in rural areas is affected.

18,Hectic political activity on eve of mayoral election,"vadodara: yet another phase of political manipulations is being witnessed in the vadodara municipal corporation (vmc) here on the eve of the elections to the post of deputy mayor. while the bjp-samata party alliance has remained intact this time, selection of the right candidate for the post has become a major bone of contention. according to sources, the formula worked out at that stage paved way for electing a samata candidate as the deputy mayor. the present incumbent shailesh mehta alias sotta, also the city samata party president, is learnt to have made his intentions of holding on to the seat clear. at the other end, a section of bjp councillors and a minister from the city are dead against his sticking to the post. senior bjp functionaries said, on conditions of anonymity, that the opposition to sotta's name was not limited to the councillors. ""several senior leaders have also strongly opposed his name. the reason being the anti-bjp tirade conducted by the leader till very recently,"" the functionary said. political observers believe that another reason for the opposition is the ensuing assembly posts. mehta may throw in his hat from the shaher-wadi constituency as a samata candidate. if he continues to hold the deputy mayor's post, it might work to his advantage against the running bjp mla and minister of state of labour, bhupendra lakhawala. sources added that samata party was being convinced to look for another candidate for the post. this, they said, would work out in the interest of both the coalition partners. bjp functionaries and councillors opposing mehta are working overtime here to create an impression that there is opposition to mehta's candidature from within the party. the reason being cited is that the party has only one of the three key posts in the vmc. if mehta holds on to it, others might continue to be deprived of a plum post. mehta, nonetheless, expressed confidence that his party members were with him for the polls.

20,`Banks must do their bit to rescue farmers',"dharwad: the banking sector has a major challenge with the heralding of globalisation and liberalisation. an expert committee on rural credit, constituted by nabard under the chairmanship of prof. v.s. vyas of the institute of development studies, jaipur, has submitted its report, and its contents are being discussed with state governments and banks, among others, according to nabard general manager g.s. menon. he was speaking at the silver jubilee celebration of malaprabha grameena bank here on wednesday. karnataka development commissioner n. vishwanath asked rural and commercial banks to expedite the process of distributing kisan credit cards to farmers to enable them take up kharif work. regretting that nationalised commercial banks were not doing their bit in helping the farmers, he urged the banks to rescue drought-hit farmers. he explained the measures taken by the karnataka government to computerise farmers' land records. menon in his address said the vyas committee, whose main task is to study the role of cooperative banks, commercial banks and regional rural banks (rrbs) in increasing the flow of credit to the rural areas, has recommended de-layering of the cooperative structure -- removal of state-, district-and village-level tiers to make credit available to the rural people at lowest interest rate. it has also recommended bringing co-operative banks under the control of nabard and reserve bank of india as against the present system of dual control involving state governments; merger of weak rrbs; and conversion of strong rrbs into local area banks to allow equity participation by private sector. menon said the working group headed by nabard managing director m.v.s. chalapati rao has started work on suggesting comprehensive amendments to the rrb act 1976. ``the objective is to make rrbs an effective instrument for the growth and development of rural economy.'' inaugurating the celebration, syndicate bank executive director m.s. kapur called upon malaprabha grameena bank officials to focus on primary health facilities for the rural people. syndicate bank former chairman n.k. tingalaya and reserve bank of india deputy general manager l.s. prabhu also spoke. musician puttaraj gawai, baburao kulkarni, suvarna suryavanshi, bank's former chairmen padmanabh hande, p.b.r. hegde, udupa, anantakrishna and k.j. ganiga were felicitated on the occasion. bank chairman r.s. kamat welcomed the gathering.

21,Hectic political activity on eve of dy mayoral election,"vadodara: yet another phase of political manipulations is being witnessed in the vadodara municipal corporation (vmc) here on the eve of the elections to the post of deputy mayor. while the bjp-samata party alliance has remained intact this time, selection of the right candidate for the post has become a major bone of contention. according to sources, the formula worked out at that stage paved way for electing a samata candidate as the deputy mayor. the present incumbent shailesh mehta alias sotta, also the city samata party president, is learnt to have made his intentions of holding on to the seat clear. at the other end, a section of bjp councillors and a minister from the city are dead against his sticking to the post. senior bjp functionaries said, on conditions of anonymity, that the opposition to sotta's name was not limited to the councillors. ""several senior leaders have also strongly opposed his name. the reason being the anti-bjp tirade conducted by the leader till very recently,"" the functionary said. political observers believe that another reason for the opposition is the ensuing assembly posts. mehta may throw in his hat from the shaher-wadi constituency as a samata candidate. if he continues to hold the deputy mayor's post, it might work to his advantage against the running bjp mla and minister of state of labour, bhupendra lakhawala. sources added that samata party was being convinced to look for another candidate for the post. this, they said, would work out in the interest of both the coalition partners. bjp functionaries and councillors opposing mehta are working overtime here to create an impression that there is opposition to mehta's candidature from within the party. the reason being cited is that the party has only one of the three key posts in the vmc. if mehta holds on to it, others might continue to be deprived of a plum post. mehta, nonetheless, expressed confidence that his party members were with him for the polls. ""all the six corporators of my party are with me and we will stick together. there are no differences,"" he said. when asked to comment regarding the opposition to his candidature in bjp, mehta said, ""i can comment on the state of affairs in my party. i cannot comment on what is happening in others.""
