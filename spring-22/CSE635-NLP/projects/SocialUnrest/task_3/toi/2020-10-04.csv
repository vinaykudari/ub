0,"Holidays, demonstrations take a toll on studies","KANPUR: The Dussehra holidays have added to the woes of students who apprehend that courses may not be completed on time.

In fact, they even doubt the universityâ€™s assertion of holding 183 classes in an academic year. This is not unfounded for studentâ€™s union polls winners are planning mass celebrations. This will hit studies in October which will witness several holidays. Clashes among supporters of studentâ€™s union leaders last week at DAV, DBC, DC Law and VSSD colleges marred studies. Low turnout of students was reported in classes in September.

Students contacted by TNN expressed unhappiness over the four-day holidays. A DAV student, Bhanu Mishra, said, â€œa confused university has compounded our problems. Holidays and demonstrations have hit studies.â€�

Many students feel that conducting classes in October would be an uphill task for college administrations.

Another student, Janardan Yadav, said, â€œGandhi Jayanti and Dussehra and Diwali will result in holidays while demonstrations will dominate proceedings in October.â€�

This has led to bickering among students and union leaders. The students are accusing the university administration of neglecting studies. Student unions are blaming the university for the mess, and claim to be struggling for the rights of students. â€œThe struggle will continue till demands are met,â€� they claim.

During a recent meeting of student unions, DAV president Gyanesh Singh said that the movement was necessary to safeguard the future of students even though it was hampering studies.

The leaders claimed that the movement enjoyed studentsâ€™ support as it would have failed without them. President of Christ Church College Vishal Jaiswal said â€œthe universityâ€™s declaration of holding 183 classes has boomeranged.â€�

1,Oppn to bitterly oppose govt's privatisation plans,"NEW DELHI: The Opposition on Saturday gave notice to the government that it would oppose any move to privatise the Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), or any of its operations, direct or through subsidiaries, without Parliamentary approval.

Contending that the oil sector giant IOC was â€˜â€˜in the same genreâ€™â€™ as HPCL and BPCL, and that collectively, they fell in the category of â€˜â€˜strategic sectorâ€™â€™, Congress spokesman S Jaipal Reddy said there was â€˜â€˜total oppositionâ€™â€™ to any move to by-pass Parliament. There could be differences in opiion on the issue of privatisation and these could be debated but there could be no compromise on the role of Parliament, he told reporters.

The CPM said privatising IOC would amount to â€˜â€˜unbridled loot.â€™â€™ â€˜â€˜The decision of the cabinet committee on disinvestment (CCD) to privatise IOC is shocking. The destruction of such a valuable public asset is nothing but unbridled loot,â€™â€™ CPM said in a press statement here.

2,Engineering students move court against increase in annual fees,"MUMBAI: Students at the SIES graduate school of technology, Nerul, Navi Mumbai, are protesting against the decision to increase the annual fees for the second-year engineering course.

The management recently decided to increase fees by 200 per cent. Some 90-odd affected students have joined hands and moved the Bombay high court against the â€œillegal fee hikeâ€™â€™ after having failed to persuade the management to rethink its revised fee structure. The fees have gone up to Rs 49,600 from Rs 14,600.

The case is likely to come up for hearing on Monday. The students have prayed for an injunction from the court, arguing that fees cannot be revised for the second-year course as per the guidelines of the Directorate of Technical Education (DTE),which monitors the functioning of engineering colleges across the state.

College authorities, however, have demanded that all fees be paid at one go and have said that students who fail to pay the full fees by October 5 will be restrained from attending classes. Attempts to contact college principal P.V. Parameswaran were unsuccesful.

â€œThe SIES management, however, has illegally and unilaterally hiked fees, despite the directions of the DET. No doubt the facilities provided by the college and teaching faculty are the best one can get, but that certainly does not justify the sudden hike,â€™â€™ complained a student, who insisted on anonymity.

The DTE has, in fact, circulated a note to all engineering, architecture and hotel management colleges, restraining them from increasing the fees for senior students who have spent one academic year in the college. The DTE directive, issued on September 19, clearly states that the fees for all students in the second, third or fourth year should remain what they had paid at the beginning of their course in that college.

The students claim that SIES is the only engineering college which has hiked its fees. â€œIf the hike is not challenged now, then all other colleges will resort to such a hike,â€™â€™ a student said. He said the college had initially offered to accept the fees in three to four instalments. However, with the students refusing to pay the revised fees, the college has demanded that full fees be paid.

3,Slow detonator rule long delayed,"HYDERABAD: Detonators are literally the key to a successful explosion, irrespective of its motive, be it mining or assassination.

For curbing the use of explosives for the latter purpose, the state police has for long been calling for regulations to dampen the spark that sets off deadly bombs similar to the ones used in the attempt on Chandrababu Naidu''s life.

Wednesday''s attack on the chief minister has once again put the spotlight on a demand of the state police to the Centre that a delaying mechanism be used in the making of detonators. The state government had years ago written to the Union home ministry asking it to order detonator manufacturers to place a mechanism which will trigger the explosive only in a random time frame ranging from 15 seconds to one minute.

Currently, detonators available in the market can trigger an explosion in less than a second. This helps subversive and militant groups able to procure these detonators carry out bombing operations with precision timing.

All that a person handling the bombing operation has to do is calculate the average speed of a vehicle and press the button, or a camera flash or a remote device as the case may be, to send a pulse to the detonator.

The detonator will, in a fraction of second, set off the bomb. Once a delayed mechanism is introduced, argues a senior police official, the effectiveness of terror attacks can be limited to a great extent.

As no one knows the exact time a detonator takes -- from quarter of a minute to a minute -- to explode, there is a lesser possibility of the bombs hitting their targets.

5,"Jeweller, wife commit suicide","NEW DELHI: A 42-year-old jeweller and his wife committed suicide on Saturday night allegedly after failing to repay a loan. Tarak Pal and his wife Anjana (38) were found hanging from a windowâ€™s iron rod at their residence at Dayalpur Extension in northeast Delhi.

The bodies were discovered by Palâ€™s brother on Sunday morning. A suicide note, written by Pal, was discovered. According to the letter, Pal had taken a loan of Rs 2.75 lakh from two of his acquaintances, Ashok Tantrik Shukla and Bhumiram Patti, in April for constructing his house. Shukla allegedly made Pal sign on blank papers.

â€˜â€˜Pal got his house constructed by July. His jewellery shop was also inaugurated. A few days ago, he received a notice from Patti stating that the property was in Pattiâ€™s name and that Pal should immediately vacate it,â€™â€™ said deputy commissioner of police (northeast) Praveer Ranjan.

Pal reportedly stated in the letter that Patti had managed to get the house registered in his name by using the blank paper which he had been forced to sign and that Patti and Shukla should be held responsible for the suicide. â€˜â€˜We have registered a case against the two and are investigating the matter,â€™â€™ added Ranjan.

The coupleâ€™s children were reportedly not at home when the incident occurred. According to the police Palâ€™s mother, Maya (60), who paid a visit on Saturday and took Palâ€™s children, Nandita (10) and Chayan (7), for puja celebrations. â€˜â€˜When they returned, Pal and his wife did not answer the door bell,â€™â€™ said a police officer. They spent the night at Palâ€™s brother Deveshâ€™s house.

When no one answered the door even on Sunday morning, Devesh broke open into the house and found them hanging. The bodies have been sent to Guru Tegh Bahadur Hospital for post mortem.
