1,"As tourists, rallyists won't go wild in reserve","ahmedabad: in a compromise formula arrived at to skirt controversy over permission granted to a car rally through the wild ass sanctuary in the little rann of kutch, the state government has asked the rallyists to enter the protected area as 'tourists'. the rally route through the little rann was altered on thursday, following an outcry from wildlife enthusiasts which forced a meeting between the gujarat motorsports association and environment and forests secretary p k ghosh in vadodara. it has now been agreed that the government will not accord any special permission to the rallyists and they, in turn, will pay the required fees of rs 5 per person and rs 50 per vehicle to enter the sanctuary, home to some 3,000 wild ass. other than wild ass, the sanctuary also boasts of chinkaras, blue bulls, wild boars, fox, hyena, hares, wolves and jackals. earlier, the rally had been granted clearance by invoking powers given to the chief wilidlife warden under section 29 of the wildlife protection act. the rally, scheduled to begin in vadodara on february 9, will be mostly on the fringes of the rann. on wednesday, congress mla urvashidevi baria had shot off a letter to chief minister narendra modi and threatened to stage a dharna if the rally was given the go-ahead.""when 70 cars run at speeds of more than 80 kmph, there is bound to be a large-scale disturbance to wildlife,"" she said. as per the modifications, the 1200-km rally will make a night halt at zainabad. though the rallyists will be visiting the sanctuary with their cars on february 10, it will be a leisurely safari rather than as part of the rally. ""we will get into the sanctuary as tourists so that we can give the rallyists, who will be coming from all over the country, a feel of the terrain, especially the mirages and the vast stretches of salt,"" said motorsports association president wing commander vijay karnik. the association had invited urvashi devi, who objected to the route of the rally, to visit zainabad on february 10 and talk to the rallyists about the need to protect the area, he added. organisers cited examples of international car rallies through forests teeming with wildlife by way of justification for the event. in this connection, karnik made mention of the kenyan rally, the san diego rally and the dakar rally, among others. he said the cars would drive at speeds less than 55 kmph and cover the sanctuary in two hours. environmentalists, however, contend that the time for holding the rally is wrong. ""many of the female wild ass are pregnant at this time as they deliver sometime in the monsoon. movements of vehicles make them run which ultimately leads to fatigue and even death,"" said one opponent of the rally. ""there is a chance of the wild ass being hit by cars passing through,"" says snehal bhatt of the gujarat society for prevention of cruelty to animals. a kharaghoda-based industrialist concerned about the rann says, ""unfortunately, the route passes through the fringes of the rann where the wildlife is concentrated."" however, environment and forests secretary pk ghosh has a different viewpoint. ""i don't think that there should be a problem. many trucks and vehicles ply there. besides, the rally will be passing through the rann for only two hours.""

3,Keshubhai plays party pooper on Modi's D-day,"rajkot: former chief minister keshubhai patel put a spanner in the ruling bjp's efforts to put up a united front before the electorate in rajkot when he refused to inaugurate the main election office of his successor, narendra modi, who filed his nomination papers for the by-elections to the rajkot-2 constituency on thursday. if it was the bjp's idea to send the right signals to the electorate, the former chief minister certainly had other ideas. though keshubhai came and met modi, it was clear to the party cadres that he still hasn't recovered from the humiliation meted out to him by the party leadership which sent him packing about four months ago. the bjp's rajkot unit had declared that keshubhai would inaugurate the main election office of modi at yagnik road on thursday evening at 7 pm. however, the former chief minister refused to comply and told the party bosses that he had to return to gandhinagar, where he had ""some engagements"". his action has sent a confusing message to the bjp rank and file because modi's election from rajkot was heavily dependent on keshubhai's support. shocked bjp leaders were tight-lipped on the open rebuff just when things were going smoothly for the chief minister. one explanation came from programme implementation committee chairman vijay rupani .he said: ""keshubhai's health didn't permit him to stay here as he has to take treatment in the morning. the bjp leaders who fixed the programme had thought that he would stay at rajkot overnight and hence would inaugurate the party's office. but keshubhai was present during the filing of the nomination papers."" earlier on thursday, although announcements were made over the public address system that keshubhai was to attend the bjp meeting before the filing of nominations, the former chief minister turned up late by almost an hour. even the speech that keshubhai delivered had no mention about the election of modi from rajkot. instead, he spoke on the tense situation on the state's border with pakistan.

10,Mulayam is a political terrorist: Salman Khurshid,"lucknow: launching a scathing attack on the samajwadi party, congress leader and former president of the upcc, salman khurshid, ruled out any possibility of a post-electoral alliance with those who had in the past strengthened the hands of the bjp. labelling mulayam singh yadav 'a political terrorist', khurshid accused the sp supremo of terrorising the minorities in the state and misguiding them to serve his own ends. ""to expose his pro-minority bluff, all that is required is a simple question: will he ever allow a muslim to become a chief minister?"" he challenged. blaming mulayam for letting down the congress in 1999, khurshid accused him of indulging in saude ki rajneeti (political wheeling-dealing). moreover, the duplicity of the sp can be gauged from the fact that in lucknow alone the party has filed candidates who were charge-sheeted for the babri masjid demolition, he said. accusing mulayam of being 'an out and out hypocrite', khurshid said his show of concern for phoolan devi at the time of her murder was a big hoax. the same man who claimed to be a part of her family denied ticket to her sister munni devi, as he had derived whatever political mileage he could out of the slain phoolan, he alleged. mocking samajwadi party's total reliance on the amitabh bachchan factor, khurshid said it only showed the desperation in the sp camp. up politics, he said, was serious business. ""politics in up meant dealing with hunger, poverty, unemployment, tears and communalism and was much more vital to be left to singers and dancers, he declared. talking to mediapersons later, khurshid said even the congress was not averse to using actors for election campaigns, but then 'we don't believe in letting them lead our leaders'. moreover, congress only went for actors with substance like dilip kumar and sunil dutt, he said. dismissing the post-iftar euphoria between sonia and mulayam, he called the meetings nothing but courtesy calls. up, he said, was veering towards a hung assembly and added he was aware that not all congress candidates would win. but the election would enthuse vigour in the cadre and the results would be there for all to see within the next twenty days here and later during the lok sabha elections, he declared.

14,"This <I>Lagaan</i> is not cricket, say farmers","bettiah: reel byte from champaner, gujarat, circa 1892. reality byte from champaran, bihar, circa 2002. meeting of the twain? the stick of babus. the already broken backs of farmers. the latter facing the horror of lagaan. champaner farmers, on celluloid, found emancipation on the cricket field. here, in champaran, harassed farmers are at their wits' end with the imposition and collection of high taxes and punitive fines on their tractor trolleys. this lagaan is not cricket, says arindam shahi, the public school educated mukhiya of mahui panchayat in ramnagar. recurrent drought impoverished the gujarati farmers of champaner. champaran's farmers face penury from recurrent floods, non-payment of sugarcane price arrears for several years and rock bottom prices of agricultural produce accompanied by ever-rising cost of agricultural inputs. the canals are full of silt and dry, yet we are made to pay irrigation tax, says vikas singh, a farmer from lauriya. it is, however, not the government drive to collect maalguzari (land rent) and panvat (water tax) which has made local farmers cry foul. howzaat?, they ask to the levying of tax on commercial rates and the exorbitant fines being imposed on tractors and trailers. this is cold blooded murder of farmers, alleges birendra kuer, mukhiya of bhaisahi-pokharia in chanpatia. strong reaction, this. but babus brush aside such criticisms as a 'silly point'. government needs revenue to pay salaries, an official justifies the drive against farmers. higher taxes and fines are natural fallouts of bihar's bifurcation, explains another officer. transport department officials, meanwhile, tow the we have targets to meet, duty-bound line. says ajay singh, farmer, tractors and trailers used exclusively for agriculture should be exempted from taxes. adds om prakash, another farmer, farmers use their trolleys only for five to six months during the cane crushing season. he asks, is it fair to levy commercial rates on year-round use? it is not merely the high, commercial rate of taxation at rs 2,400 per annum per trailer which has irked champaran's farming community. they are bitter at the fines being imposed at 200 pe rcent. there should be a one-time tax on trailers and tractors, demands jagdish pandey of chanpatia. alleges kamran sheikh, former district congress chief, sugar mills are required to pay cane price arrears with interest which is never done, adding if at all fines are levied, they should be taken as interest at bank rates. clearly, champaran's farmers draw a parallel with the film lagaan. the extremities in lagaan demand made champaner's farmers accept british challenge on the cricket field. they mastered the alien game to ground the babus in defeat. here, farmers face defeat at the hands of a government elected on the promise of social justice. ironically, the de facto raja of bihar is also the de jure head of state cricket. the white man's game is now popular even in remote villages. but, farmers are unable to read this government googly. the story of lagaan comes from gujarat. so did a man called gandhi.

""due to free flow of spurious liquor, the revenue from beverages corporation was in the realm of rs 750 crore so far as against rs 2,000 crore expected revenue. ""those in government are favouring the liquor mafia. it cannot blame the cpm"", vijayan said.

22,Defence lawyers blame audience for aggravating tragedy,"new delhi: defence lawyers cross-examining witnesses in the uphaar case on friday tried to prove that the disaster was aggravated by spectators trying to escape without caring about others. ""it is incorrect to suggest that after smoke was noticed in the hall, there was commotion and the circumstances became abnormal. (but) it is correct to suggest that everybody was trying to escape without caring for others,'' said prosecution witness karan kumar during his cross-examination in the court of additional district and sessions judge mamta sehgal. he told the court that he along with his father and sister and an elderly couple had formed a human chain as the smoke-filled hall was plunged into darkness. but the human chain broke and his search for his father and sister ended up with finding both their bodies in the row of dead at the hospital. in his testimony last year, kumar had told the court that there was no light, no announcement and no help for the people trapped inside. he could rescue only an elderly lady. her husband and his (kumar's) father and sister were trapped and succumbed to the smoke and fire. according to him, 10 to 15 minutes after the interval smoke started pouring in from various points, including the ac duct. ""there was no exit, no alarm, nobody from the management. people started running helter-skelter trying to find a way out. soon, the movie too went off,'' he had told the court. on thursday, a person who had saved several lives during the fire told the court that there was no alarm inside the hall to warn that a fire had broken out. gopi chand babuta also said there was no one to guide the audience out of the hall. babuta said he was 500 metres away from the hall when the fire broke out. ''there was no light inside the balcony and there was nobody to help them. i do not remember how many doors we had to unlock after going inside,'' babuta said. babuta, who was injured while saving lives, did not give his statement to the police. ''they took me to uphaar cinema after one week. i narrated to them how i had rescued the people. the cbi recorded my statement two and a half months later,'' babuta said. he denied having given a false statement at the cbi's instance. fifty-nine persons were killed and 104 injured when a fire broke out in the basement transformer of uphaar cinema during a matinee show of the hindi movie border on june 13, 1997.
