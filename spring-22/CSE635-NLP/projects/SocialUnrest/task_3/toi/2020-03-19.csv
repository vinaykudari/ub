0,Punjab traders to hold bandh over VAT soon,"LUDHIANA: Punjab Pradesh Beopar Mandal president Tulsi Das Jaitwani on Tuesday held the government responsible for creating a wedge between the industrialists and the traders over the issue of implementing VAT system from April 1.

Though the big manufacturers have expressed satisfaction, the trading community is not ready to accept it at all, he said in a statement.

Jaitwani maintained that the country has witnessed intense opposition with regard to reforms in sales tax, the government instead of resolving this, created another â€˜provocationâ€™ in the form of VAT forcing traders to take to streets. Jaitwani also expressed strong reservations about the outcome of the proposed plan of joint representation to the Prime Minister by industry and traders on the issue.

There was no way out except launching a sustained stir, he added. Giving details, he said that Punjab traders would organise a protest rally from Abohar to Rajpura as part of nationwide trade bandh on March 31 and April 1. The different aspects of VAT will be discussed during the rally, he said.

1,Pardaphaash rally: BSP cadre upbeat,"KANPUR: After initiating inquiries against the Samajwadi Party leaders the Bahujan Samaj Party is all set to create more problems for them in its proposed â€˜Pardaphaash rallyâ€™ scheduled for April 14 in the state capital.

All this is being done to avenge the release of a video tape by the SP to claim that chief minister Mayawati was corrupt.

The BSP leaders in the city have been asked to ensure a huge gathering from the proposed rally. Party sources disclosed that facts and documents highlighting the corrupt practices of SP supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav and national general secretary Amar Singh were being collected by the party to expose them during the Pardaphaash rally.

Not only BSP leaders even senior bureaucrats of the state are busy collecting facts against SP big-wigs as the chief minister wants to avenge the video tape expose in a big way. BSP leaders in the city and Dehat have already launched an awareness campaign among party workers to protect Mayawati in public during rival partyâ€™s onslaught.

2,Lesson from Iraq: India needs to increase surveillance tools,"NEW DELHI: One immediate lesson which the Indian armed forces can draw from the US attack on Iraq is the need to bolster their rather small inventory of intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) platforms.

Military experts say UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles), AWACS (airborne warning and control systems), strategic reconnaissance aircraft and military satellites have become absolutely crucial in modern-day warfare to enable the use of precision-guided munitions.

``With electronic and signal intelligence, one can now know where exactly to deliver the crippling blows on the enemy''s command and control structure. Long-range weapons are not of much use if strategic enemy targets cannot be pinpointed due to lack of ISR platforms,'''' said an expert.

Tactical UAVs, in particular, have emerged as potent force-multipliers. UAVs or spy drones, which resemble small gliders, transmit high resolution real-time video or data about strategic locations or troop deployments while flying over enemy territory back to their base stations.

The US, which is also inducting armed drones, is extensively deploying ``Global Hawk'''' and ``Predator'''' UAVs during the ongoing Iraqi operation after their successful use in Afghanistan.

India, however, has been a late starter in this field. It was only after the 1999 Kargil conflict that the armed forces pushed for induction of advanced UAVs.

Consequently, India has procured several ``Searcher-II'''' and ``Heron'''' UAVs from Israel, at an estimated cost of $

300 million, over the last two years. India is also negotiating joint production of the ``Heron'''' UAVs, which can undertake an autonomous 1,000-km flight and operate over 30,000-feet altitude, with Israel.

While the Army and the IAF already have a few UAVs, the Navy has also now swung into action by establishing a unit at Kochi with four ``Herons''''. Similar naval UAV bases are planned for Port Blair and Lakshwadeep Islands.

The Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) is also going ahead with limited series production of the indigenous UAV or remotely piloted vehicle ``Nishant''''. ``A large order from the Army is expected very soon,'''' said a source.

Incidentally, both India and Pakistan had deployed UAVs during the 10-month military confrontation last year. There were at least seven recorded Indian airspace violations by Pakistani UAVs during that time. The surveillance game still goes on, with India shooting down a Pakistani UAV in the Mendhar area of J&K on February 5 this year.

4,"11 hurt in 'communal' clashes in Rajkot, A'bad","AHMEDABAD: Cricket played spoilsport once again in the sensitive Gomtipur area of Ahmedabad, sparking off violence and arson on Wednesday night. Rajkot, too, witnessed violence involving members of rival communities, where a trivial issue led to an armed assault that left six persons injured.

In Ahmedabad, around five people, including two policemen, were injured and two shops burnt in separate incidents of violence in Gomtipur and Shahpur areas. Eleven persons, belonging to two communities, were arrested at Gomtipur. The police had to lob 46 teargas shells to control the rioting mob.

A game of cricket, being played in the area, sparked off trouble near Mahavir flats in Gomtipur at 10.30 pm and snowballed into a major skirmish. â€œBy 11 pm, hundreds of people had taken to the streets and had started pelting stones at one another,â€� said a police official.

Two shops and two kiosks were set on fire. Violence engulfed the whole area, from Kamdar Maidan to Shamsherbaug, leaving four people injured. Though by and large peaceful, the Tol Naka road that divides the two communities was tense even on Thursday afternoon. Both the communities blamed each other for Wednesdayâ€™s violence.

â€œWe were watching some boys from the majority community play cricket, when a friend of ours was hit by a ball, leading to exchange of abuses. Finally things went out of control and people from both the sides started pelting stones at one another,â€� said a student living in the locality.

However, a member of the majority community gave a different version and said that things were peaceful till a member of the minority community started hurling abuses at the boys who were playing cricket. In the incident at Shahpur, policemen were attacked while forcing roadside â€˜laarisâ€™ to shut shop at 11 pm near Wahab no Addo.

â€œAs soon as we asked them to close down, a few stall owners started abusing us. They also pelted stones and hurled crude bombs at us,â€� said a police official. The violence continued for about half-an-hour, leaving one constable injured and a police van damaged.

In the past few months, numerous small skirmishes have taken communal colour, but the police vehemently denies they were communal in nature. In yet another incident at Rajkot, members of the Devipujak community clashed with members of the minority community, in the Nava Thorala area, over a trivial issue.

The violence left six people, including three women, injured. Police commissioner V V Rabari said on Thursday that a close watch is being maintained in the area. Onlookers gather around shops gutted during Wednesdayâ€™s violence at Gomtipur in Ahmedabad.

5,SAD-BJP members protest Speaker's conduct,"CHANDIGARH: Disgusted with the alleged partial behaviour of Punjab Vidhan Sabha speaker Kewal Krishan, the SAD-BJP members staged a walk-out during the debate on the Governor''s address on Thursday.

Senior SAD legislator Balwinder Singh Bhunder, participating in the debate, was addressing the House on the matter, when the Speaker asked Congress MLA Sadhu Singh to start his speech. Bhunder kept pleading that he be allowed to conclude his address at least, but the Speaker did not budge.

Peeved at the Speaker''s attitude which was termed as â€œanti-Oppositionâ€�, the entire SAD-BJP combine walked out of the House.

Earlier, Bhunder condemned the state government for following â€œantifarmerâ€� policies. He said the crop diversification programme undertaken by the state was meant to support the private sector and would in no way help farmers'' cause.

He ridiculed the idea of allotting 28,000 acres of the total 40 lakh hectares of land for diversification exercise, which, he said, would be carried out by the private sector. Instead of going in for this, Bhunder suggested the government to bring about improvement in the quality of seeds and fertilisers provided to farmers.

He regretted that the state had not allocated adequate funds for research in agriculture and research centres like the Punjab Agriculture University were being starved of financial support.

Farmers in the state, he said, should also be provided support for proper dairy development. Bhunder also opposed privatisation of the Punjab State Electricity Board, which, he alleged, would result in heavy burden on consumers.

Bhunder said the SAD was ready for consensus on the state policy to deal with the SYL crisis, but wondered how could his party carry it out in the face of baseless criticism launched by the ruling party against the Akalis. He pointed out that at all stages it was the Congress which worked against the interests of the state and now the Congress had suddenly become champion of the cause.

BJP MLA Avinash Rai Khanna was critical of the state government for ignoring the interests of the trading community and teachers. Sadhu Singh (Cong) fired the SAD-BJP for failing to serve the cause of the state during their government''s tenure. He said corruption was rampant during its period even as administrative inefficiency touched an all-time low.

7,"Woman, paramour commit suicide","NEW DELHI: A woman and her alleged paramour committed suicide in southwest Delhi. The police recovered their bodies on Thursday morning from a barren piece of land in Bijwasan.

The woman, Sita, was in her late twenties and had three children. Her eldest son is 12 years old. The police recovered a suicide note from her paramour, Bhim Singh.

â€˜â€˜The letter does not blame anyone for the suicide. It states that the two have

committed suicide because they loved each other but could not get married,â€™â€™ said deputy commissioner of police (southwest) Tajinder Luthra.

The DCP said Sita and her husband Chander Bahadur, who works in a farmhouse, were tenants at Bhim Singhâ€™s house in Brijwasan. Singh worked as a security guard in Palam Vihar.

â€˜â€˜Four years back when Bahadur learnt about his wifeâ€™s relationship with Bhim Singh, he decided to leave the house,â€™â€™ Luthra said.

The two, however, continued to see each other. And when Sita was stopped from meeting Bhim Singh, the two decided to commit suicide. â€˜â€˜While Singh was found hanging from a tree, Sita had consumed poison,â€™â€™ Luthra said.

8,Karunakaran for govt initiative to settle LDF stir,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Senior Congress leader K Karunakaran on Thursday asked the A K Antony government to take initiative to end the stand off with the Opposition LDF over its demand for a judicial probe into the police action on tribals at Muthanga.

""The Chief Minister''s stand that the opposition leaders can come and talk to him is not correct. It is the government which has to take the initiative to end the stalemate,"" Karunakaran told reporters here.

The LDF agitation in the last few days had caused grave inconvenience to the people. The government should ensure the people do not suffer, he said. Karunakaran said he favoured a judicial probe from the very beginning.

The senior leader said the government should order an inquiry to bring the truth to light, whichever form of probe it might be.

Asked about Antony''s decision to observe a day''s fast on March 24, he said he did not agree with such an attitude.

9,Kerala ministerial team to meet PM,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: A three-member ministerial team from Kerala will leave for Delhi on Friday to meet Prime Minister A B Vajpayee to discuss measures for safe passage of Indians in Kuwait and other Gulf states in the event of US-led war on Iraq spilling on to the Gulf region.

The team, comprising Non-resident Keralite Affairs Minister M M Hassan, Tourism Minister K V Thomas and Public Works Minister M K Muneer, would also meet Foreign Minister Yashwant Sinha and Civil Aviation Minister Syed Shahnawaz Hussain, the ministers told a joint press meet here on Thursday.

""We will apprise the PM and his colleagues of the anxiety in the minds of lakhs of families in Kerala about their kith and kin in the Gulf and request the PM to put in place all arrangments for their evacuation if a need arises,"" Hassan said.

Information from the Centre as well as the Indian embassies in the Gulf was that there was no need for panic as the situation was not as bad as it was during 1991 Kuwait war. Also, the Centre had made plans in advance to help the Indian community in the Gulf if a contingency arose, they said.

Air India had promised to operate special flights to bring Indians before the closure of airports in the affected countries, Hassan said.

The Non-resident Keralite Affairs (NRK) department had opened control rooms here and in New Delhi to gather and pass information to the affected families, Hassan said.

The Ernakulam District Collector had been asked to offer all help to returnees landing there via Mumbai. Air India would be operating flights from the Gulf to Mumbai and then to Kochi, he said.

The Centre would be requested to make special arrangements for Indian students scheduled to take CBSE examinations in the Gulf centres in case the war disrupted the conduct of examinations there.

The Ministry of External Affairs would be requested to instruct Indian embassies in the Gulf to pass relevant information to the control rooms opened by the NRK department.

Hassan said some of the Gulf Malayali organisations had informed him that they were imparting lessons to the members of the community on how to respond to emergency situations. They had formed special squads for the purpose.

Kuwait alone is estimated to have four lakh NRIs, half of whom are Malayalis, Hassan said.

Telephone numbers of NRK cells: Thiruvananthapuram: 0471-2518129, 2518182, New Delhi (Kerala House): 011-23011010, 23011500, 23012500.

10,"With eye on 2004 polls, Patil presents soft budget","MUMBAI: With an eye on the next assembly elections scheduled for 2004, the state government on Thursday presented a soft budget and floated social welfare schemes in the names of reformers Chhatrapati Shahu, Mahatma Phule and Babasaheb Ambedkar.

Presenting his fourth state budget, finance minister Jayant Patil announced a Rs 2,000-crore scheme to enhance infrastructure in Mumbaiâ€™s suburbs. This will supplement the Rs 4,500-crore Mumbai Urban Transport Project, which is partly aided by the World Bank. The scheme, specially launched to strengthen the suburban road transport system, will be implemented by the Mumbai Metropolitan Regional Development Authority.

The authority will use Rs 1,000 crore of its own resources and raise the remaining Rs 1,000 crore from the market and from other sources. The plan envisages developing road links to connect the eastern and western suburbs and strengthening the existing north-south suburban road links.

The project will include constructing flyovers, roadover bridges, replacing level crossings, building footpaths and improving the traffic flow near suburban railway stations.

The government will get Rs 2,600 crores of the Rs 4,500-crore MUTP from the World Bank.

The finance minister said the government will soon introduce a social responsibility bill to ensure that the weaker sections of society are protected and get minimum support.

Listing various social measures undertaken during the medium-term fiscal reforms programme, Mr Patil said, â€œOur government will initiate budgeting for human development and design, and implement a scheme to be known as Project Unite.â€™â€™

He pointed out that the state government had published a human development report with the help of the United Nations Development Programme.

He said Project Unite would consider schemes for weaker sections not as charity or social security but as an investment with the highest potential for socio-economic returns.

Mr Patil said in keeping with the views of economist Amartya Sen, the Democratic Front government would institute a mechanism to integrate social justice with development planning. He said the government would observe July 26, birthday of Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj, as Social Justice Day and publish a social justice report every year. The government will set up a social justice cell in the planning department to monitor the state governmentâ€™s social welfare schemes. The government has made a provision of Rs 25 lakhs to prepare the social justice report and a social justice index. Scholarships will be extended to three lakh girls from standard VIII to X. The scheme will cost Rs 30 crores. Students who stand first in

the general list in the state SSC and HSC examinations will be paid Rs 2.5 lakhs each while those standing first in each board will be paid Rs 1 lakh each. Students who qualify for the general merit list will be paid Rs 50,000 each.

Students who stand first in each district will be paid Rs 25,000. One hundred students belonging to backward classes will be selected through competitive examination and the top ten students will be paid Rs 2.5 lakh per year. The government has earmarked Rs 10 crore to provide better hostel facilities for students.

It has also proposed the Indira Gandhi woman protection scheme to help destitute women, women in distress, widows, deserted women, orphan girls and victims of sexual exploitation.

Women covered by the scheme will be paid Rs 250 each per month. The government has also made a provision of Rs 26 crore to provide free textbooks under the Sarva Shikshan Mohim (Campaign for total literacy). A provision of Rs 109 crore has been made for mid-day meals in schools.

The government has chalked out a programme for cleaning rivers in the state under the national river action plan. This year, the government has made a provision of Rs 20 crore; the total project cost is Rs 55 crore.

The government has also increased provisions for the below-poverty-line food programme. Workers who have lost jobs because of industrial closures and with an income income of under Rs 15,000 per year will be entitled to a below-poverty-line ration card.

The budget has also made a provision to fund memorials for freedom fighter Nana Patil, poet B.S. Mardhekar, to erect a statue of Chatrapati Shivaji on Raigad fort, and to make a television serial on Chatrapati Shivaji that will be telecast on Doordarshan.

It also has made provisions of Rs 40 crore to acquire land for a multi-modal cargo hub at Nagpur; Rs 184 crore to modernise the police force; Rs 101 crore to develop coastal tourism; Rs 360 crore to conserve the Ajanta-Ellora caves; Rs 12 crore to develop Ashtavinayak road links; and Rs 5 crore for the Chaitya Bhoomi at Dadar.
