0,Muffled voices reach ministers,"HYDERABAD: The sound of students pulling at an iron door on the top floor of the Government School for the Deaf at Malakpet greeted two ministers as they visited the institution on Tuesday to inquire into the alleged atrocities happening there.

The ministers and accompanying reporters found that about 100 hearing-impaired children had been locked up by the authorities behind a grill that separates the second floor from the rest of the school. Commercial taxes minister K Vijayarama Rao pushed past the crowd and, seeing the children craning their necks through the spaces in the iron grill, demanded to know who had locked up the students. None of the school authorities or bureaucrats of the disabled welfare department present ventured an answer. Once the grill was opened, the children mobbed Vijayarama Rao and minister for tribal welfare Manikumari.

With the help of an interpreter, the children said though they had time and again informed the authorities about goondaism and sexual harassment in the school, the officials always tried to cover up for the antisocial elements. â€œThe school authorities and the officials of the disabled welfare are hand-in-glove with the mafia elements who are harassing us. All of them have been bribed by the criminals,â€� a girl student said using sign language. After hearing the students for a while, the minister asked the teachers to take the protesting students back to the classrooms on the promise that he would take the complaints of each class in succession.

The main demand of the students was that they be protected from Chandrasekhar Reddy, a former student of the institute who allegedly ran a mafia ring within the institution. The children described in detail the various incidents of violence perpetrated by Chandrasekhar Reddy, including an alleged murder in Sept. 2001 in which he figures as an accused. The children also complained that almost all their teachers illtreated them. They wanted friendlier staff. They also demanded security for the hostel in order to prevent outsiders from harassing the girl students. When told that there was a plan to shift the boys into a separate hostel, both the boys and the girls showed the thumbs-up signal indicating that they were happy with the decision. When the girl students were asked whether they faced harassment from their classmates, apart from the former students, the girls vigorously shook their heads.

They said the boys of the school were their friends and that it was only former students and outsiders who created problems for them. Vijayarama Rao later said he was disappointed about the condition of the school and that â€œa few heads would roll.â€� He also lambasted the teachers of the school. Later, commissioner of disabled welfare Sundarvadan said the chief minister has ordered the suspension of an assistant director of the department, Narsimhlu, and hostel warden Vijaya Kumar.

1,Hectic political lobbying for mayor’s post,"NEW DELHI: The new mayor would be elected in the Delhi Municipal Corporation (MCD) on April 7. The announcement of the date of the mayoral elections has fuelled hectic lobbying among Congress councillors in the MCD. The number of contenders has swelled due to the fact that the mayorâ€™s post is open to councillors selected from general seats. Next year, the post would be occupied by a reserved candidate.

Several councillors are reported to have approached AICC general secretary, incharge of Delhi Congress, Kamal Nath and Pradesh Congress Committee, Subhash Chopra for getting the official nomination for the post.

Chief of the Congress in MCD and leader of the House, Ram Babu Sharma, refused to disclose much about the front-runners. He said the selection of the mayoral candidate would be made by the party high command.

â€˜â€˜The decision of the party seniors would be final,â€™â€™ he said.

Some probables contacted on Tuesday refused to publicly confirm their willingness to take up the post. â€˜â€˜Circulation of my name at this pre-mature stage may harm our interest,â€™â€™ said one of them, on condition of anonymity.

The names doing the rounds include that of mayor Jaishree Panwar who is reported to have made a claim for a second term. â€˜â€˜I have done good work during the last one year and my chances of getting another opportunity to serve the city are bright,â€™â€™ she said.

Several councillors elected to the corporation for the second time are reportedly eying the post. Names of deputy mayor Pannalal Khairwal, Satbir Singh, Ashok Jain, Jaikishan Sharma and Memwati Barwala figure prominently in the list of probables. A mayor is more of a figurehead of the MCD with limited powers.

2,"Explain yourself minister, says oppn","BANGALORE: Ahead of an all-party meeting to discuss the CET wrangle, the opposition put higher education minister G. Parameshwara in the dock on Tuesday over his â€œdualâ€™â€™ role as minister and management representative. In the Assembly, opposition leader Jagadish Shettar said the governmentâ€™s â€œmishandlingâ€™â€™ of the issue has evoked suspicion.

â€œBy showing helplessness, you have opened yourself to doubt. There was scope for filing a review petition or taking it up with the Centre, but you have not shown any initiative, so one wonders on whose side you are.â€™â€™ B. Somashekar (JD-U) added: â€œA senior Congressman who heads a medical college in Davanagere, has put out an ads in the papers announcing the fee structure for courses in his college.

Can you take any action against this?â€™â€™ Jayaprakash Hegde (JD) said Parameshwara could prove his â€œcleanâ€™â€™ credentials by announcing that government seat matrix would apply to the Siddartha group of institutions in Tumkur, which he heads. Parameshwara will reply to the debate after Wednesdayâ€™s meeting. Govt explains: The government hasnâ€™t gone for a review of the SCâ€™s CET order as it was not â€œlegally faulty.â€™â€™

Law and parliamentary affairs minister D.B. Chandre Gowda said this during the discussion on CET. â€œWe have to explain what is the extraordinary situation under which we want a 11-judge constitutional bench order to be reviewed, and we cannot do this. We had given a written affidavit on the reasons behind the CET and why it should be continued. What new argument can we furnish now,â€™â€™ he asked.

3,House committee indicts govt dept,"PATNA: The estimate committee of the assembly has indicted the rural development department (RDD) of the state for not monitoring the expenses made in poverty removal schemes and suggested that the secretary of the department carry out a random survey to find out if benefits of Rs 4000 crore spent on 15 poverty eradication programmes between the financial years 1998-99 to 2000-01 had reached the grassroots.

The report of the committee led by Umashankar Singh was tabled in the assembly on Tuesday. It pointed towards the failure of the RDD to implement a 1996 order of the Union ministry of rural employment and poverty alleviation to constitute state, district and block-level vigilance committees which would oversee and supervise central schemes. â€œItâ€™s a matter of shame that the Central programmes were being implemented without the constitution of vigilance committees,â€� the report states.

The report pointed out that the department issued orders to regional commissioners and DMs for the constitution of committees in December 1998. Even after the order no step was taken to constitute a state-level vigilance committee. The committee observed that there were no documents with the department to suggest that district and block-level committees had been formed and were functional.

The then RDD secretary of RDD, K A H Subramanyam, wrote a letter to all commissioners and DMs expressing â€œhope that the committees had been constituted and were functionalâ€�. â€œItâ€™s a pity that the nodal agency for implementing Central welfare schemes for the poor has shown no interest in proper utilisation of funds,â€� the committee remarked.

The committee alleged that the RDD did not make available statistics on expenses and the number of beneficiaries and there was a lack of transparency in the functioning of the department.

4,"Let down, farmer sets himself ablaze","MYSORE: Official apathy in releasing compensation for land lost under a government housing scheme coupled with mounting debts due to failure of crops, resulted in a farmer ending his life by immolating himself.

On Sunday night, Sangappa of Linganpura village in Chamarajnagar taluk, set fire to waste hay and firewood dumped in an abandoned well in front of his house and jumped into it. Next morning when his son Shivananjappa saw flames leaping out of the dry well and discovered materials for pooja, he suspected the worst.

Though the fire brigade from Chamarajnagar rushed to the spot they could only recover the farmerâ€™s burnt body after clearing the waste. It was revealed, the government acquired land belonging to Sangappa in 1983 to build 40 houses for shelterless people from the village. When he tried to get compensation for the land, it was futile. In fact, Sangappa was sent to jail on the charge of preventing officers from discharging their duty.

5,1 killed in Gundlupet clash over drainage,"GUNDLUPET: One person was killed and two others sustained serious injuries when people of two castes clashed at Bammalapur village in the taluk on Monday night. The police said the clash followed a dispute over the laying of drainage pipes. The government had recently sanctioned a drainage scheme for the village under Nirmala Grama Yojane and work was in progress.

One community objected to the spot where drainage water was to be finally let out, saying it was a religious place. On Monday night, some youths, who were protesting, were challenged by people of another caste resulting in a wordy duel which later turned into a fight with daggers, lathis and rods.

Stones were pelted at houses. Three persons sustained injuries and one of them died on way to hospital. The police rushed to the spot and chased away the mob. Prohibitory orders are in force. Officials led by Chamarajnagar S.P. Pandurang Rane are camping at the village.

6,Absentee ministers to get notices,"BANGALORE: Ministers, who have been irregular to the Legislative Assembly since the session commenced on February 27, will be issued notices by the government chief whip A.S. Nada Gouda shortly.

As regards the 155 Congress MLAs including associate members, a tab will be kept on their attendance. Some members who used to just sign in the muster rolls and disappear will also have some explaining to do, henceforth. Speaking to The Times of India here on Tuesday, Gouda said he had taken the absence of ministers in the ongoing session seriously. â€œI want the ministers to whom notices will be sent to explain their absence. I am getting details of the number of hours and days allotted for the ministers to sit in the Assembly and why some of them did not adhere to it,â€™â€™ he stated.

Gouda said the ministers have been instructed not to convene meetings during the session hours and also not to accept invitations for functions in their constituencies. â€œIn the previous session, I wrote letters to them. But this is the first time notices will be issued,â€� he added.

The appraisal reports which the Congress high command is seeking from its MLAs have one column where the members have to reply on the number of days the session met and the number of days they attended. Gouda said one reason for the poor attendance in the post-lunch session was: â€œThe MLAs who either go home or to their rooms for lunch have visitors waiting for them.

They get busy in meeting the visitors.â€� A move to do away with the lunch hour was vetoed in the Business Advisory Committee meeting on Tuesday. According to Gouda, there was no provision in the conduct of the business rules on tackling absenteeism by members. â€œThe members should not expect a whip to be issued frequently to ensure their presence in the House,â€™â€™ he added.

7,"Centre to blame for weavers’ plight, says minister","PATNA: Minister for small-scale industries Ravindra Charan Yadav on Tuesday held the Central government responsible for problems being faced by 1.32 lakh weavers of the state. He was replying to questions during a special debate on problems of weavers in the state legislative council.

He informed the House that 34,367 weavers were from the co-operative sector and the rest 97,927 from the non-cooperative sector. The minister warned that the demand of handloom products would further come down this year because the WTO agreement had become fully operative in the country.

The minister charged the Centre with releasing a sum of only Rs 2.69 crore under a Central government-sponsored weaversâ€™ welfare scheme â€” Workshop-cum Housing Scheme â€” for which the state government had demanded Rs 4.49 crore.

The Central government was also accused of releasing a sum of just Rs. 61.27 lakh against the state governmentâ€™s demand for Rs 1.68 crore under a cent percent centrally-sponsored health package scheme.

The minister also talked of some stalemate in the release of amount for the welfare of weavers under the Deen Dayal Handloom Promotion Scheme. He also cited the case of the Union government turning down the schemes for special package, handloom park and for yarn supply at mill gate price.

B N Lal (CPI), Ramkripal Yadav (RJD), Basudeo Singh (CPM), Arun Kumar (Cong), Uday Narayan Rai (RJD), Birkeshwar Singh (BJP) were prominent among those who participated in the debate.

8,City divided into 20 development zones,"LUCKNOW: The city seems to be heading for a better and efficient system of planning, with the area being divided into about 20 zones and then further into sectors to streamline developmental work. The developmental area of Lucknow has also been increased by another 390 sq km.

The board meeting of the Lucknow Development Authority on Tuesday passed the draft of the Master Plan 2021 which would be available at the collectorate and also at the Pradhikaran Bhavan, Gomtinagar from April 5, at a nominal cost, so that people peruse through the document and raise objections within 30 days.

The objections and suggestions will be heard by a committee and thereafter sent to the board for final drafting. Once the final draft is passed, it will be sent to the government for approval. The budget allocations will be decided at the next board meeting on March 21.

The development area of Lucknow has been increased from the present 850 sq km to 1240 sq km. Approximately, 165 villages will be added to the present 174 villages. The areas will be till the Sai river on Kanpur Road, till Indira Canal on Faizabad Road, till Mohanlalganj on Rae Bareli Road and a few kilometres beyond Amar Shaheed Path on Sultanpur Road.

Moreover, the Uttaretia, Alamnagar and Dilkusha railway stations will also be expanded to reduce the burden on the Charbagh railway station. For solving the water problem, those areas (2700 hectares) where recharging of groundwater is not proper, are being marked as ''Paryavaran Parks''. While there seems to be no solution for the Vikalp Khand problem at present, the LDA has decided to allot land marked as institutional area to those who had been allotted plots in Viraj Khand, Gomtinagar.

The final costing for the buildings in Vastu and Vinamra Khands will be done as per the condition of the buildings. There was also a decision to issue recovery certificates against four of the 11 bulk sale cases in which the builders had not cleared the dues. Four cases were under arbitration at the High Court and the rest were under the One Time Settlement scheme.

Wood cutting machines, godowns of transport agencies and wholesale markets will be shifted to the outskirts, while there was also a proposal for making a plan for regulating the traffic. Moreover, six new bus and truck stations each have also been proposed on the main roads, beside three new auto markets and an area of 90 hectares for exhibitions and fetes.

Besides marking three heritage zones of historical, cultural and archaeological value to be protected, construction of buildings under security zones like the chief minister''s residence, Governor House and Vidhan Sabha will not be allowed in future.

Buildings in densely populated areas will henceforth be limited to a particular height. Another cattle colony has also been proposed by the LDA on Kursi Road. An Urban Art Commission has been formed to incorporate the principles of Vastu Shastra in development.

Following directives from housing secretary JS Misra to complete the Master Plan, zonal plans and sectoral plans within 18 months, the board has already divided the area into 20 zones for wider planning, according to area- wise specifications. Genuine problems regarding registration of properties will be solved within 30 days of depositing the money and on March 31, it is expected that registrations will be done throughout the night.

10,Two US envoys resign protesting Bush's Iraq plans,"WASHINGTON: In the first signs of brewing discontent in the Bush administration over its Iraq policy, two top US diplomats have so far resigned saying they cannot support the president''s war plans.

John Brady Kiesling, political consular at the US embassy in Athens, resigned in February protesting the administration''s Iraq policy.

Joining him, a veteran US diplomat John Brown sent in his papers saying he could not support Washington''s Iraq policy as it was fomenting a massive rise in anti-US sentiment around the world.

Brown, who joined the State Department in 1981, said in his resignation letter to Secretary of State Colin Powell that he agreed with Kiesling''s viewpoint.

""I am joining my colleague John Brady Kiesling in submitting my resignation from the foreign service - effective immediately -- because I cannot in good conscience support President Bush''s war plans against Iraq,"" he said.

""Throughout the globe, the United States is becoming associated with the unjustified use of force,"" Brown said in the letter.

""The president''s disregard for views in other nations, borne out by his neglect of public diplomacy, is giving birth to an anti-American century,"" he said.

11,India protests US state's resolution on Kashmir,"WASHINGTON: In an unusual move, a US State legislature has passed a resolution on Kashmir which India feels could have been done under the influence of anti-India and pro-Pak elements.

The resolution passed by New Hampshire legislature recently called for ""increased diplomacy to achieve a just, peaceful and rapid resolution of the conflict between India and Pakistan, relative to the state of Jammu and Kashmir.""

Voicing concern over the development, India''s Ambassador to the US Lalit Mansingh, in a letter to the leaders of the legislature, said that Jammu and Kashmir continued to face cross-border infiltration of terrorists from Pakistan which is the world''s ""most notorious breeding ground for terrorism"".

Despite foreign policy being the prerogative of the US President, the concurrent resolution 16 was passed by active influence of anti-India and pro-Pak elements with accompanying speeches reflecting Pakistani propaganda.

Mansingh said cross-border terrorism is continuing in Kashmir despite Islamabad''s pledges to US to stop it.

""Pakistan''s territorial claims on India are both irredentist and illegitimate.... Over the last 55 years, it has sought to expand those territorial ambitions through the use of force,"" Mansingh said.

""Having initiated and lost three wars with India, Pakistan, now relies on the use of terrorism to achieve its political objectives,"" he said.

Mansingh said Pakistan''s ""nurturing of the al-Qaeda and the Taliban ...and acts of terrorism against India are products of the same jehadi culture that the Pakistan military has assiduously fostered over the years.""

13,Kerala govt approves Liquor Policy for 2003-04,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The Kerala Cabinet on Wednesday approved the liquor policy for 2003-04, which allows Kerala Tourism Development Corporation (KTDC) to start wine and beer parlours.

State Finance and Excise Minister K Sankaranarayanan told reporters here that the cabinet also decided to sanction 4356 toddy shops that would yield license fees of about Rs 20-24 crore.

System of individual licensing of toddy shops would be continued in all districts expect in Thrissur and Ernakulam where an old method of group license was in practice, he said.

Sankaranarayanan said beer and wine parlours of KTDC would be sanctioned after examining their proposals and in the case of opening beer parlours in Special Tourism Zone, individual restraunts also would be considered in places where KTDC did not have any outlets.

14,Malaysian minister regrets harassment of Indians,"NEW DELHI: Visiting Malaysian minister for Entrepreneurial Development Dato Seri Mohamed Nazri Abdul Aziz on Wednesday regretted Sunday''s incident, involving the harassment of 270 Indians, mostly IT professionals, in Kuala Lumpur.

This came even as the external affairs ministry stepped up pressure on that country asking for â€œquick answersâ€� to the concerns it has expressed about the incident and said that the issue was â€œcasting a shadow on bilateral tiesâ€�.

Aziz told HRD Minister Murli Manohar Joshi that the Malaysian authorities did not condone such incidents and they were being inquired into. He said he would convey to his government India''s â€œunpleasantness and concernâ€� over the incident, an official release said.

Joshi told Aziz that Indian settlers had contributed significantly to the well-being of Malaysia and any harassment to them was â€œnot in the best interests of the bilateral relations''''.

The government, he said, had allowed Indian professionals and students to go abroad only after adequate verification. Earlier, the external affairs ministry spokesperson disputed the statement of the visiting Malaysian minister that this was part of a drive against illegal immigrants. He said if it was such a drive, â€œIt seems to have been pretty misguided in its implementation since almost all those arrested had been released on the basis of perfectly valid documents.â€�

It was important to note, he said, that the Malaysian illegal immigration drive is basically aimed at unskilled workers pouring in from other countries and not highly qualified IT professionals who had been issued smart cards by the Malaysian authorities. To equate this category of people with potential illegal immigrants is wrong, the spokesperson said.

15,"Mamata inching closer to BJP, NDA","NEW DELHI: Trinamul Congress leader Mamata Banerjee, who has been waiting impatiently for a cabinet berth, is trying hard to inveigle herself into the BJP camp. After staying away from Delhi for a long time, she is presently making her presence felt both inside and outside Parliament. On Wednesday, Mamata announced her arrival in the Lok Sabha after a long gap when she raised a noisy protest over the deteriorating law and order situation in West Bengal. In the afternoon, she played host to several BJP and NDA leaders at the inauguration of her new party premises at Mahadev Road.

BJP President Venkaiah Naidu did the honours by cutting the ribbon to the Trinamul''s new home while NDA convener George Fernandes hoisted the party flag. Trinamul members, who were present in full strength, rose to the occasion, raising slogans of â€œBJP-Trinamul Congress zindabadâ€�.

The sub-text of the whole exercise appeared to be an attempt by Mamata to underline her proximity to the BJP leadership and to reiterate her political relevance. Mamata''s relationship with the BJP has gone through many ups and downs as she has gone from being a loyal NDA alliance partner to a bitter critic and back as a member of the ruling combine. Having returned to the NDA fold, after a brief dalliance with the Congress, Mamata is now waiting to be re-inducted into the cabinet. The invitation to Fernandes was a clear olive branch as Mamata had fallen out with him when she quit the NDA to press his resignation from the cabinet on the Tehelka issue.

Talking informally to reporters at the tea party, the BJP president went out of his way to underline the close relationship between his party and the Trinamul. Naidu admitted that the two had a brief misunderstanding when Mamata had left the NDA but they have now joined forces to fight the misrule of the Left Front in Bengal. As for her re-induction into the cabinet, Naidu was more circumspect, coming up with the stock reply: â€œThat is the PM''s prerogative.â€� Naidu supported Mamata''s demand for a CBI probe into the recent incident of gang rape in Bengal as he joined hands with Mamata to denounce the Left for adopting double standards.

16,'Cow slaughter banned in most Cong-ruled states',"NEW DELHI: The Congress on Wednesday pointed out that most of the states governed by the party have legislations in place against cow slaughter and that the BJP should bring in such a law in Nagaland, where it is a partner in the new government.

Party spokesman Jaipal Reddy explained that the Congress was only opposing the statutory resolution on cow slaughter on procedural grounds in the Lok Sabha on Tuesday because cow slaughter is not a Central subject.

Reddy refused to announce his party''s stand on the issue saying that the BJP should first get the proposed Central legislation approved by the NDA partners and then approach the opposition, and not through the media, as it is doing now.

On the controversy over the voters'' list in Madhya Pradesh, Reddy said that the list was not even final and that if there was any dereliction of duty on the part of the district collectors, as pointed out by the Election Commission, then the issue should be settled between the EC and the state government. â€œThe chief minister has said that all the facts would be made available to the EC,â€� said Reddy.

17,"This is not an election, it is a selection","NEW DELHI: Policymakers may not take the Standing Committee on Public Enterprises (SCOPE) too seriously when the government is trying to get out of business. But for some of the contestants vying to head the lobby of state-run units, itâ€™s a business serious enough to hit the road for canvassing support with fellow PSU heads.

This year, the main tie is between Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) chief and incumbent SCOPE head Subir Raha and National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) chief C P Jain. Giving them company is Kribhco chief V N Roy. The convention so far has been that the contestants canvass support by writing to the heads of 240 member-PSUs, big or small.

Being heavyweights in their respective industries, both Raha and Jain have added their touch to the campaign this time round. While Raha is calling up his counterparts, Jain has met personally some of his electorate. Both Raha and Jain declined to comment. Jain confirmed meeting â€˜â€˜someâ€™â€™ constituents personally, without going into details.

This has apparently upset some of the constituents, who say this is against the tradition. â€˜â€˜Normally, one does not meet the constituents personally as that would entail travelling on the taxpayerâ€™s money for something that is not part of official duty. Besides, it is not a political tamasha. But, there is nothing wrong if one is in town for official work and meets up with a chief of another state-owned unit,â€™â€™ said a former SCOPE chief who declined to be named.

With the ballots set to close on March 17, even directors are getting active. Two PSU heads said some directors working with one of the contestants called on him to canvass support for their bosses.

18,BJP plans to divide Congress.. and rule,"NEW DELHI: The BJPâ€™s gameplan in the run-up to the assembly elections and the Lok Sabha polls scheduled for next year, is to divide the Congress on ideological lines, to sharpen the divide between the Nehruvian secularists and the soft Hindutva lobby in that party.

If the first blow was struck with the unveiling of the portrait of Veer Savarkar in Parliament, which exposed the split within the Congress on the issue, the second was struck on Tuesday on the issue of a ban on cow slaughter. The BJP knows that even though most Congress-ruled states have a law banning cow slaughter, the Congress will find it difficult to support a central law as it might send a â€˜â€˜wrong messageâ€™â€™ to its support base among Muslims, Christians and Dalits.

On Tuesday, the Congress may have successfully averted a vote on a BJP-sponsored private memberâ€™s resolution in the Lok Sabha, asking the government to bring in a central law on the subject. But it was only a temporary relief.

The BJP knows it does not have the required two-thirds majority to get a constitutional amendment through to enable it to pass a law on a state subject, but by bringing the issue to the forefront, it will force the Congress to take a stand nationally on the matter, and provide the BJP with electoral ammunition against it.

19,No national policy against terrorism in India: Gill,"HOSHIARPUR: Lashing out at the â€˜intellectual eliteâ€™ who had no understanding of what terrorism was all about, former director general of police K P S Gill said that they were impediments in governmentâ€™s decision to handle terrorism strongly enough.

Gill while speaking to TNN said that that the recent example of lobbying for pardon for the Delhi 1994 bomb blast accused Devenderpal Singh Bhullar was nothing short of making indulgence in terrorism look so easy.

â€˜â€˜First you kill so many people and then have a human rights movement in your favour. Isnâ€™t that making terrorism look simple,â€™â€™ questioned Gill?

The former director general of police, who is planning to meet the Prime Minister on this issue, was of the view that it was very difficult to get convictions in Indian courts against criminals and when a terrorist does get convicted, there should be no pardon. Gill said the whole purpose of setting special courts was defeated if a convicted terrorist was pardoned.

Terming Indiaâ€™s policy on terrorism as a confused one, Gill claimed that there was no national policy against terrorism in India. â€˜â€˜We have a mixed policy with a combination of the state and the Centre and in my opinion there is not even a single state that has a tough policy on terrorism,â€™â€™ he said.

Gill, who has been credited with wiping out terrorism from Punjab, stated that the security forces were able to root out terrorism in Punjab only after the Beant Singh government gave a clear direction to eradicate terrorism.

According to him, a stop and go policy cannot withstand terrorism. He said that since presidents rule in Punjab was a six month affair and there would always be some element of change in the governmentâ€™s stance on handling terrorism it was only after Punjab got a government for five years in 1992 that terrorism was able to be rooted out.

Claiming that a similar policy with a clear direction is required for the entire country, Gill said the rest should be left to the security forces.

On being asked that would a strategy similar to that used in Punjab would control terrorism in Kashmir, Gill said security forces were capable of controlling terrorism if only the government took a tough stand.

Bhullar case

K P S Gill says that why such a hue and cry over Devenderpal Singh Bhullarâ€™s death sentence when certain religious and political outfits and the human right organisations have always maintained that they will respect the verdicts given by courts in similar cases.

20,Nine arrested for labourer's death,"HYDERABAD: Nine persons including the sarpanch and upa sarpanch of Chandanagar village were detained by the Cyberabad police on Wednesday on charges of forcing a labourer to commit suicide.

Antaiah, a native of Tangedupalli village, had come to Chandanagar a month ago in search of work. A week ago, he broke a coconut in front of K Shankaraiahâ€™s house which made the villagers suspect him to be a sorcerer.

A group of villagers led by sarpanch Venkataiah, upa sarpanch Venkateswarlu, former sarpanch Prabhulingam and six others beat up the 50-year-old man and locked him up in the gram panchayat office for the last one week, police said.

They planned to free Antaiah only after bringing another sorcerer to counter the sorcery of the former. The villagers also collected funds for this purpose. But in the meantime, Antaiah allegedly hanged himself with a towel at the gram panchayat office on Tuesday evening.

Some villagers noticed Antaiah hanging from the ceiling and informed the sarpanch. Subsequently, the Moinabad police were informed about the incident. Police detained the nine persons responsible for the incident and are investigating.
