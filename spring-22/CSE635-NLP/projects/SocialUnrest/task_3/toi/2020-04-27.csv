0,CPM fields young faces for polls,"KOLKATA: Sensing the public resentment against domination of older rural neo-elites, mainly school teachers-turned party bosses, the CPM now wants young people, both men and women, to lead the panchayats. This would also help the party to avoid the anti-incumbency factor and fallout of popular anger against corruption and nepotism of many a pancahayat leaders in the forthcoming panchayat polls. Party state secretary Anil Biswas said on Sunday that 23,594 candidates, 48 percent of the total partymen in the fray,would be young people below 40. Similarly,the party has pitted 20,239 women, 41 per cent of the total party candidates. We had declared earlier that teachers would get the least nominations this time. So we have fielded only 2,978 persons with professional background like teachers, six per cent of total candidates in comparison to more than ten per cent last time,'' said Biswas. Realising that the partisan use of panchayats and lack of popular participation in decision-making processes have been making room for the Opposition, the Marxists now want to accommodate dissenters within its fold as much as possible. We want more democratisation in rural self governance — more power not only to panchayats but to the people.We want changes in laws to protect and extend the rights of not only the elected representatives but also of the electorate. We will seek the opinion of all political parties,'' said Biswas, releasing a booklet promoting villagers' involvement in planning, resource management and implementation of development projects. Another booklet tried to explain the effects of central economic policies. Admitting that instances of financial mismanagement and corruption are not few, the party also wants the government to be make laws 'stringent' against corrupt panchayat members and officials. As Left Front partners are also vociferous against 'bullying tactics of the CPM leaders at ground level', Biswas wanted to make sure that the allies do not turn towards the Opposition. He assured to check his overzealous partymen, We have instructed our district committees to honour the bipartite agreements with the partners regarding seatsharing and told them to withdraw any dummy or independent candidates pitted against allies. We have received four specific allegations on that and district committees have been asked to take punitive actions who have filed nominations against allies, said Biswas. To prove that the party is sincere, he informed that 1,256 CPM candidates have withdrawn their papers reducing the total number of the CPM candidates to 49,342 from 50,598.

1,'Doctors should abide by sex selection Act norms',"PUNE: Taking serious cognisance of the declining male-female ratio, which is currently 1,000: 922, in Maharashtra, additional director of health, Prakash Bhatlawande, on Sunday urged the medical fraternity to strictly abide by the norms laid down in the pre-conception and prenatal diagnostic techniques (prohibition of sex selection) Act, 2003.

Lamenting the plummeting sex ratio in the 0 to 6 age group, he said it had come down to an alarming 1,000:917.

â€œAccording to the amended prohibition of sex selection Act, â€œregistrationâ€� of ultrasonography machines is mandatory for all doctors. Moreover, doctors should maintain records of patients undergoing sonography,â€� Bhatlawande said at a seminar organised by the Indian Medical Association (IMA) on Sunday.

On January 17, 2003, the President of India gave his assent to amendments to the â€œineffectiveâ€� pre-natal diagnostic techniques (regulation and prevention of misuse) (PNDT) Act, 1994, now called preconception and pre-natal diagnostic techniques (prohibition of sex selection) Act.

Bhatlawande said manufacturers of ultrasound equipment were now required to sell their products only to registered clinics, which would have to maintain records of tests conducted by them.

â€œI would also like to make it clear that no doctor (detector) would tell patients the sex of the child via signs, words or any other medium. Such an act will call for strict action,â€� Bhatlawande said.

2,Appropriation Bill will not affect government: Patil,"PUNE: Finance minister Jayant Patil on Sunday allayed fears that the Rs 2,700-crore appropriation Bill would create any political or financial crisis for the Democratic Front government, saying the allocation was already a part of the Rs 12,000-crore state annual plan.

The Bill was unanimously passed by the legislative council recently. Speaking to reporters after presenting the late Varunraj Bhide awards for journalism, Patil explained that the demand for Rs 2,700 crore to correct the irrigation imbalance in backward areas was already a part of the state annual plan.

â€œWe have made a provision for the amount in the Rs 5,300-crore offbudget borrowing. The money will be actually allocated after discussions with the planning board in June this year,â€� he revealed. Patil remarked that as the provision had been already made, there was no question of accepting or rejecting it.

â€œOpposition parties should stop making political capital of the Bill and should not claim that they have secured the money to correct the irrigation imbalance in backward areas,â€� he said.

Patil rejected claims by opposition leaders that they had demanded that the Rs 2,700 crore be allocated from the state budget.

â€œThe legislative councilâ€™s records show that the demand for allocation of Rs 2,700 crore was in the state plan,â€� he stated. Reiterating that the Bill will not lead to any political or financial crisis.

Patil observed, â€œPersonally, I feel that nothing can be achieved by calling a special assembly session as the lower House does not have the power to amend the Bill once it is passed by the legislative council.â€� To a question, Patil said the Rs 500-crore special purpose vehicle bonds floated by the government had received a lukewarm response.

â€œAs compared to the bonds for the Maharashtra Krishna Valley Development Corporation, response to the bonds for other corporations was slightly better,â€� he said. Patil was of the view that half-completed irrigation projects be completed on priority.

On the current imbroglio regarding the value-added tax (VAT) system, the finance minister said 16 states, which contributed almost 75 per cent of the countryâ€™s trade, were ready to implement VAT.

He said there would be no problems in implementation of VAT if the Union government was willing to compensate states for the initial revenue loss.

â€œHowever, the Union government should clarify its stand on the issue,â€� he said. On the issue of excluding essential commodities from VAT, Patil said he had made the suggestion in a meeting of state finance ministers.

â€œThe matter would be further discussed in the next meeting on April 29,â€� he said, adding that these commodities could be brought under the purview of VAT once the system stabilised. Pointing out that the 147 countries which follow VAT system also faced problems in the initial stages, Patil said, â€œProblems can be identified only after VAT comes into force and nothing can stop us from making amendments to the Act.â€�

He rejected claims that VAT would lead to harassment of traders on the issue of assessment. â€œAlmost 95 per cent of assessment would take place automatically. Moreover, the state government is willing to listen to the committee of traders regarding the necessary amendments.â€�

3,Forest officials indifferent towards ex-minister,"LUCKNOW: That Ram Lakhan Verma was a forest minister in the Mayawati cabinet in 1995 and, as an ardent lover of wildlife, took pride in keeping elephants which also happened to be his party symbol, may be a thing of the past. That Verma had of late switched loyalty from the Bahujan Samaj Party to team up with the Samajwadi Party remained evident by the manner in which the forest department, of which he had been a minister earlier, handled the situation. Or mishandled it?.

Had it not been for the alleged indifference shown by the forest department officials, the life of the elephant would have been saved. And any timely effort would have saved the life of Ram Lakhan Verma as well. But none seemed bothered. Sample this:

To begin with, frantic efforts to trace the district forest officer (DFO) proved futile for the district authorities who continued to send SOS to the forest department as they had neither the expertise to tame a rampaging male elephant nor the strategy and equipment required. While the DFO remained untraceable all day long, the forest ranger surfaced at Pahapur village but not before 2 pm even as the first SOS by the district authorities was sent around 7:30 am.

When the local forest ranger did make an appearance, all he was there with was his experience in dealing with such a crisis, which was no match for the requirement. He neither had the equipment nor tranquilliser guns to knock the furious beast unconscious. This added to the panic of the local residents and the police. None could dare to even venture closer to the agitated elephant Lal Bahadur. The maximum that anyone could dare was not more than 100 metres from the elephant.

Having failed to generate any effective response from the forest officials, the district authorities in Ambedkar Nagar got down to contact the officials at Lucknow Zoo. Seeking a back-up of experts who could temporarily immobilise the elephant and take it into custody, the district authorities saw the telephones ringing at the Lucknow Zoo virtually all day long.

Meanwhile, firing at the agitated elephant was the only option with the district authorities as a ferocious Lal Bahadur trod towards the main township wielding threat to the lives of hundreds of residents and shoppers thronging the local market. Over 200 rounds of bullets were sprayed from private licensed guns and the barrels of the police and the PAC jawans at Lal Bahadur. He suffered over a dozen deep wounds all over his body. And he hit the ground three times, only to spring back to feet shortly thereafter and continue to storm towards the township.

Leaving the authorities with not much option, the elephant had to be finally shot dead as a measure to eliminate possibilities of him storming into the township and thus multiplying the tragedy. But even as Lal Bahadur lay dead to innumerable bullets, top officials of the forest department remained elusive. Or ignorant.

The principal secretary, forests, was not available while one of the special secretaries was fast asleep when contacted by TNN at his residence after 4:30 pm on Sunday for details of the incident.

Another special secretary was not even aware of the incident till Sunday evening. For him, this correspondent was the first person to have informed him about the tragedy which took place more than 7 hours before the phone call was made. Surely, Ram Lakhan Verma was no longer with the BSP nor was he the forest minister. And the forest department made this more than obvious by their shocking indifference to the entire incident.

4,CPI hits out at Rabri govt,"PATNA: The Bihar governmentâ€™s style of functioning is typically similar to that of the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre, said CPI national secretariat member Atul Kumar Anjan while addressing a meeting at the Janshakti ground in Adalatganj here on Sunday.

Instead of procuring wheat from the farmers of the state in the current harvesting season, the state government is busy with its â€œlathi ghumawanâ€� rally, Anjan said. He said that both the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre and the Rabri government in Bihar have adopted anti-farmer policies.

Anjan said that the maize crop cultivated on about 1.40 lakh hectare of land in Bihar has been ruined because of the inferior quality seeds provided by Monsanto, a US-based firm. He also expressed his surprise over the state governmentâ€™s mysterious silence on the rape of a woman at Bettiah.

5,Pesu at work for RJD rally as people suffer,"PATNA: Patna Electric Supply Undertaking (Pesu) is busy giving final touches to â€œextra electric fittingsâ€� at several posh residential houses of RJD ministers and legislators in view of the RJD rally in Patna on April 30. Meanwhile, power situation in the state, including Patna, remained grim on Sunday.

Dozens of posh residential premises of RJD ministers and legislators have been illuminated with halozen and vapour lights to accommodate hundreds of party workers. The â€œgood workâ€� of Pesu workers was noticeable in different parts of the city. â€œThe Pesu staff never acted with such a sense of purpose in other emergency work,â€� said a Pesu official.

At least half a dozen transformers are kept in readiness to meet any emergency. Some â€œtrained technical staff of Pesuâ€� have also been kept as stand-by. The decorated pandals put up at ministersâ€™ houses will have proper arrangements for stage lighting, table and ceiling fans and air-coolers, sources said.

The demand for power is likely to go up in the city by 50 to 100 MW during the rally days. â€œIt would be sleepless nights for senior BSEB and Pesu officials as they are â€˜expectedâ€™ to provide uninterrupted additional power supply to Patna for at least two days,â€� said an official.

â€œThe hue and cry over illegal power connections has once again been exposed,â€� said a junior Pesu staff.

However, Bihar State Electricity Board (BSEB) spokesman Arjun Singh denied that Pesu staff are being engaged in the job of giving illegal power connections to ministers and MLAs during the period of the rally. However, sources emphasised that arrangements have been made to ensure uninterrupted power supply to the city from April 28 night to April 30.

Bihar, on Sunday drew 508 MW of power from the central sector. Biharâ€™s own power plants at Barauni and Muzaffarpur could generate only 100 MW.

Bihar, in total, has been getting 608 MW of power, of which Pesu has been allotted 195 MW as against its normal demand of 300 MW. Pesu resorted to loadshedding for nearly two hours in each locality on Sunday.

6,Norms issued to deal with rally,"PATNA: The state police headquarters have issued broad guidelines with regard to effective crowd management so that a large gathering during the RJDâ€™s â€œBJP Bhagao Desh Bachaoâ€™ rally slated for April 30 here may not turn into a serious law and order problem.

The guidelines are basically aimed at improving the regulatory mechanism. Police officials down the line have been instructed to give utmost importance to free flow of road traffic besides providing security to rail passengers.

The police headquarters have already issued instructions to all zonal IGs, range DIGs, SPs and Government Railway Police. DGP D P Ojha has directed all the SPs to create a separate control room in their respective districts to monitor flow of vehicles carrying rallyists to the state capital.

The control room must start functioning by April 29, the DGP is reported to have told police officials.

IG (headquarters) Neelmani said that effective deployment of police force would be made at strategic points so that reaction time of police could be minimised to a great extent in the event of any law and order problem. He said that the force would be well-equipped and stationed at strategic places in full protective gear.

Stress would be laid on security arrangements on roads as well as in trains so that common people do not suffer on account of the rally. Adequate escort parties would be provided to long-distance trains passing through the state capital so that bonafide passengers do not face difficulty.

Neelmani said that special care has been taken to prevent any stampede at the Patna railway junction.

As far as traffic regulation in Patna is concerned, the police would adequately publicise the route by which vehicles would be allowed to ply. Cranes would be stationed at Mahatma Gandhi Setu and Koelwar bridge so that vehicles devel-oping snag on these bri-dges do not create any traffic jam.

7,Dubious selection process,"LUCKNOW: The violence during the counselling process of UP Post-Graduate Medical Examination (UPPGMEE) 2003 revealed the alarming situation where candidates with dubious distinctions are gaining access to super-speciality medical courses.

What strengthened the doubts being created over the selection process are the reports that top 60 merit-holders include two close relatives of senior Congress leaders, wards of over half a dozen bureaucrats, over two dozen such candidates who graduated from private medical colleges of UP having mediocre reputation and those graduating from state medical colleges with poor academic record.

AP Singh, a candidate graduate from Allahabad medical college, said that it could not be a coincident that top merit-holders were in one way or other related to senior politicians and bureaucrats. â€œReports of anomalies in selection appear to be true as there cannot be any smoke without fire,â€� quipped Radhey Shyam Agarwal, a retired government official, who had come with his daughter.

Candidates said: â€œThe violence appears to have been perpetrated in a pre-planned manner by the candidates graduating from private colleges from outside UP, who have been denied admissions after a court order.â€� They also said that one could easily assume about the â€˜qualityâ€™ of these candidates, who apparently had taken admissions to MBBS courses by paying hefty donations.â€� They were surprised how such candidates made it to the final selection list and demanded that there should be a CBI inquiry into the examination process.

However, officials of the Chhatrapati Shahuji Maharaj Medical University (CSMMU), which conducted the examination this year, ruled out any possibility of anomalies in the selection process and said that they were ready to put in their papers if any evidence proving anomaly in the examination was brought before them.

8,Ex-minister crushed to death by pet elephant,"LUCKNOW:Ram Lakhan Verma, forest minister in Mayawatiâ€™s cabinet in 1995, was popular more for the elephant he owned than probably his services as a minister.

The elephant, a live symbol of Bahujan Samaj Party, was used extensively for the partyâ€™s campaigning then. The same elephant, Lal Bahadur, turned a killer. And the prey was none other than the ex-minister himself.

On Sunday morning in Ambedkar Nagar district, Verma was trampled by the tusker which turned wild. The residents of the area and district authorities struggled for about two hours to rein in the elephant before was shot dead as he neared a densly populated hamlet threatening the lives of many locals.

Superintendent of Police (SP) Rajkumar K N Kureel, talking to Times News Network (TNN) from Ambedkar Nagar said that the tusker was showing signs of restlessness since Saturday.

Even the mahout Teeja had had a tough time controlling the pet. However, by night he s

obered down but was under constant watch.

Ram Lakhan Verma who was in Lucknow was informed about the behaviour of the elephant. He immediately rushed to his native village of Pahapur in Jalalpur police circle of Ambedkar Nagar. By the time he reached the village, the tusker was back to his restless ways.

Verma managed to take him to a mud-mound near Bharbharpur on the village outskirts. This was the place where the former minister had earlier brought Lal Bahadur whenever he turned wild.

After struggling for an hour, Verma managed to tame the tusker and was about to take him back to the village when the elephant again turned restless.

This time Verma climbed the mound and tried to hit Lal Bahadur on the forehead with a barchi (small pointed iron rod with a curved tip). The barchi, eye-witnesses said, got stuck on the ear of Lal Bahadur who then moved back one step. While doing so, Verma who held the other end of the barchi, lost control and fell from the mound. The elephant immediately crushed Verma to death and then stormed towards the hamlet.

â€œPanic stricken villagers then opened fire at the animal from a distance. Most of the bullets grazed Lal Bahadur infuriating him further,â€� confirmed sub divisional magistrate (SDM) Mahesh Prasad.

After initial attempts by the villagers and local police, PAC was summoned to tame the tusker even as locals continued to fire at the elephant.

â€œMore than 200 rounds were fired by the locals and the police during the operation that lasted nearly two hours before Lal Bahadur hit the ground,â€� said a local resident and an eye-witness Vivek Singh to the TNN on phone.

Lal Bahabur ran out of breath trying to flee from the bullets being sprayed at him.

He eventually fell down and was chained. However, the district forest officer (DFO) and local forest ranger remained elusive even as frantic calls were made by the district officials to the Lucknow Zoo seeking help to overpower the elephant by using sedatives.

At around 2 pm the forest ranger reached the village without any equipment to silence the rampaging beast.

Lal Bahadur, meanwhile, was up once again and began heading towards the township which was barely a 100 metres away. At this point the district authorities decided to gun down the elephant around 7 p.m, IG Police Lucknow Zone AK Jain said.

The mortal remains of the former minister would be consigned to flames at his native village at 8 am on Monday while the forest officials were struggling to shift the body of the elephant from the village.

9,Helmet rule extended for pillion riders,"HYDERABAD: As the May 1 deadline for the helmet rule draws closer, the city police have decided to give pillion riders one more week to comply with the new rule.

""For the first one week, we will concentrate on drivers not wearing a helmet. We will not insist on pillion riders wearing a helmet, but just for a week, unless they are extremely rash drivers,"" deputy commissioner of police (traffic) K Sreenivas Reddy told The Times of India on Sunday. But after May 7, no one will be spared, he added.

Helmets are a must in almost all big cities of the country except in Hyderabad due to a government order issued in 1989. ""But they are necessary for the safety of people, especially with the burgeoning traffic of Hyderabad,"" he said. The city has over eight lakh two-wheeler riders.

Narrating a recent accident, involving a two-wheeler when a motorcyclist braked to save a dog,

Sreenivas Reddy said the rider fell, hitting the footpath, and died on the spot. ""If the man had worn a helmet, he could have been saved,"" he added.

Reddy said other than saving life, helmets also keep away dust, sun and exhaust. ""They protect people from the sun during the summer, rain and cold in winter,"" he added.

RTA joint commissioner (transport) C L N Gandhi said 500 RTA personnel and 1,500 policemen will check two-wheeler riders for helmets.

""The fine will range between Rs 100 and Rs 300 depending on the type of vehicle,"" he added.

10,CPI asks govt not to permit discotheques,"HYDERABAD: The CPI has demanded that the government immediately withdraw its decision to permit discotheques in tourism-related resorts and clubs.

Addressing a press conference after the party''s threeday state committee meeting which concluded here on Sunday, CPI state secretary Suravaram Sudhakar Reddy said the permission for discotheques would increase crime rate in the city.

Sudhakar Reddy disputed AP Electricity Regulatory Commission (Aperc) chairman G P Rao''s claim that only 11 paise per unit of power charges would be increased after 2004. He said the electricity tariff would increase by 70 paise per unit as against 11 paise, imposing additional burden on the common people.

He said the meeting, in a resolution, also condemned forcible eviction of families from the Tirumala hills.

The CPI also demanded that the government order a judicial inquiry into the death of nine persons due to non-availability of oxygen in the Kurnool government hospital recently.

The nine left-wing parties would organise a state-level convention on Monday at 10.30 am at the Basheerbagh Press Club. The convention would decide the future course of action to be adopted against the government''s failure in mitigating the sufferings of the drought-hit.

11,"Dust storm spoils rally preparations, power supply hit","PATNA: A dust storm lashed the city late on Sunday night uprooting a number of trees and hoardings related to the RJD-sponsored April 30 rally at different places. Various localities plunged into darkness following power cut in the wake of the storm.

According to weather department, the stormâ€™s speed was about 70-km per hour. â€œAn upper cyclonic storm has developed over Bihar, Jharkhand and the Gangetic West Bengal due to westerly depression over Rajasthan,â€� said a weather department official here.

Movement of traffic was hit in Dakbungalow, Fraser Road, Exhibition Road and Gandhi Maidan area due to collapsed hoardings. Particularly at the Dakbungalow roundabout, the collapsed hoardings were lying abandoned. A large number of vehicles, including trucks, were â€œstrandedâ€� at different points in the area.

Workers busy at Gandhi Maidan for making arrangements for the proposed RJD rally faced difficulties in the wake of duststorm. â€œPower cuts have hampered our efforts to complete work in time,â€� said Tileshwar Prasad, who was engaged on Gandhi Maidan premises for installing public address systems for the proposed rally. Many tubelights fixed on trees in Gandhi Maidan either fell down on the earth or stopped working following the storm. â€œWe are shocked to witness the extent of damage caused to arrangements made for power supply at the rally venue,â€� said Sheo Kumar, who is associated with Pesu.

The BMP jawans deployed at Gandhi Maidan were the worst-hit. â€œOur tents have been uprooted. Our beds have got wet due to rains,â€� said a BMP jawan.

At several points, labourers were seen struggling hard to restore the collapsed hoardings with the help of bamboos after the duststorm.

Ironically enough, though Sadhu Yadav and Subhash Yadav, the two brothers of chief minister Rabri Devi, do not see eye to eye, two hoardings carrying their names were hanging in the air while touching each other at the entrance gate of Gandhi Maidan in front of the Reserve Bank of Indiaâ€™s office.

14,Residents protest over boy’s 'death' in police custody,"GHAZIABAD: Nearly 2,000 local people blocked traffic on the Delhi-Ghaziabad road for several hours. They were protesting against the alleged â€˜custody deathâ€™ of a 14-year-old boy in Sahibabad police station.

The crowd dispersed only when they were assured by the police that the boy had escaped from the custody and was not dead.

Police circle officer (city) Kamal Kishore told the angry crowd that the boy had only escaped from the custody of Shalimar Garden police post after four days of custody and that they would find him.

Shalimar Garden police post chief Mahendra Singh Bhadoria said the police had brought the boy for questioning, in connection with the theft of a motorcycle. But he admitted that the boyâ€™s interrogation and his alleged disappearance had not been placed on the police records.

No action has been taken against any police officer for the boyâ€™s disappearance from the custody.

According to residents of Pasonda locality, the boy had been taken to Shalimar Garden police post at about 8.45 am on Thursday. He was later taken to the Sahibabad police station and brutally beaten.

A resident, who claimed to have seen the boy in custody, said: â€˜â€˜He had been beaten up so badly that he could hardly stand, leave alone run away from the custody.â€™â€™

The residents produced receipts of telegrams sent to top Ghaziabad police officers and the National Human Rights Commission, about the boy on Friday. But the police said the boy had â€˜â€˜only been brought in for questioning at about midnight on Sunday. He ran away, from the Karan Gate police post, at about 1.30 am on Monday. â€™â€™

15,"Mumbai first, politics later, Sena told","MUMBAI: While backing the Shiv Senaâ€™s Mumbai First mission, prominent non-Marathi-speaking Mumbaikars on Sunday cautioned the party against stopping the population influx into the metropolis.

However, most speakers agreed with Sena working president Uddhav Thackeray that other states should undertake the responsibility of creating greater employment opportunities in a bid to stop their residents from making a beeline for Mumbai.

There was a general consensus on setting up citizensâ€™ vigilance panels at the local level to guard the cityâ€™s skyline. The nitty-gritty of panel formation would be worked out soon, Sena MP Sanjay Nirupam, who organised the seminar, told mediapersons.

However, the vehemence with which many speakers turned down the Senaâ€™s crusade against the population influx surely made Mr Thackeray feel a trifle uneasy under the collar. â€œA Marathi-speaking person canâ€™t dream of going to Lucknow, winning an election there and becoming a minister in Uttar Pradesh. But this happens in Maharashtra,â€™â€™

he retorted when one of the speakers spoke about the cosmopolitan character of Mumbai. â€œMumbai is like a mobile phone which has a free incoming service. But Maharashtra should not be made to pay the price for being a better-administered state with greater employment opportunities,â€™â€™ he told another speaker.

Noted lyricist Javed Akhtar set the tone of the meeting by stating that shutting the door on people from other states was â€œundemocratic and un-Indianâ€™â€™.

â€œYou cannot stand at railway stations with a â€˜dandaâ€™ and stop people from stepping onto the soil of Mumbai. You cannot stop the hungry and the underfed from coming here. Create jobs elsewhere and people wonâ€™t leave their hometowns,â€™â€™ said Mr Akhtar. â€œStarting a crusade against the population influx could be a violation of the right to freedom of movement guaranteed by the constitution,â€™â€™ warned actor-producer Sanjay Khan.

â€œThere arenâ€™t any good parks or amphitheatres or plazas in this city. There is not a single landmark which can showcase the cityâ€™s spirit. Mumbai is bleeding,â€™â€™ he said.

HDFC chairman Deepak Parekh said the problem of the ever-mushrooming slums could be effectively resolved by constructing affordable tenements for the urban poor.
