0,Maharashtra government in crisis,"MUMBAI: The 30-month-old Democratic Front (DF) government was plunged into a crisis on Sunday after nine of the MLAs supporting it announced that they would no longer back the Vilasrao Deshmukh ministry.

The MLAs of the Peasants and Workers Party (PWP), the Janata Dal and the Communist Party announced at a news conference that they would inform Governor P.C. Alexander on Monday that they would no longer support the government. Maharashtra Janata Dal president Shripati Shinde would arrive here on Monday morning and a letter withdrawing support would be sent to the governor in the afternoon.

But chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh exuded confidence that his government did not face any imminent threat. The DF was still supported by 150 MLAs in the assembly which has a strength of 288, he claimed.

The Congress has 74 MLAs, while the NCP has 61 (including Suesh Jain who was re-elected from Jalgoan on Sunday).Nine of the 12 independents also support the DF.The BJP has 56 MLAs, while the Shiv Sena has 69.

The crisis within the DF was precipitated three days ago because of the re-induction of the Nationalist Congress Party''s Sunil Tatkare, who was asked to resign 62 days ago because of a political crisis in Raigad district. This was objected to by the PWP, five of whose ministers sent in their resignation letters to Deshmukh.

2,JEE for law colleges mooted,"LUCKNOW: Suggesting ways to improve the quality of advocacy in the state, Chairman Bar Council of UP, DP Singh, on Sunday said that amendments should be made in Advocate Act and Bar Council Act wherein a law student should undergo a mandatory one-year of apprenticeship before being enrolled for practising in the law courts.

While speaking at the inaugural session of the Prof ML Chandani Memorial Lecture Series, organised at the second campus of Lucknow University, he advocated holding of a joint entrance examination for all the law colleges of the state on the lines of the Combined Pre-Medical Entrance Test.

He also expressed concern over the deterioration in the quality of advocacy with time and appreciated the efforts of the LU law faculty for starting community service programmes.

Chief guest on the occasion, Justice Vishnu Sahai, said that practising law was both challenging and fascinating. Describing three stages of work, he told the students that in the first stage they would have to work hard with less remuneration. However, in the next two stages once they establish themselves as advocates, they will get more money against the work done.

A workshop on â€˜Know Yourself: Positive mental healthâ€™ was organised on the occasion, which was attended by over 70 students of the law faculty. Prof Pallavi Bhatnagar, faculty in LU psychology department, who conducted the workshop, said that though people in India were disease conscious, they did not care much about their health, particularly the mental factor.

â€œWe listen more what others have to say about us and do what they want, while neglecting our inner voice, which results in various mental problems,â€� she said.

The workshop provided a platform to share the experiences of the students and asked them to be more forthright for positive mental health. Prominent among others present on the occasion were LU vice-chancellor Prof SB Singh, deputy judge advocate general, JAG, HQ CC, Brig Anil Srivastava, family members of late Prof ML Chandani, faculty members of law and LU teachers.

3,UP’s liquor policy turning into a scam,"LUCKNOW: The liquor policy formulated by Rajnath Singh government is now snowballing into a major scam in Uttar Pradesh.

Besides politicians, distilleries and liquor barons are believed to be major beneficiaries in what appears to be some Rs 1500 crore scam.

Aimed at breaking the liquor cartel, the new policy has, ironically, created another one â€” that of distilleries. Under the new arrangement, distilleries have been given free hand not only to jack up liquor prices but also garner more profits by way of â€˜non-existenceâ€™ components.

Highly-placed sources claimed that liquor majors had joined hands to get the new policy cleared in 2001 and implemented from April 2001.

Ironically, Uttar Pradesh is perhaps the only state incurring heavy losses through its liquor policy. While distilleries were making profits of over Rs 1000 crore, the state was losing revenue tot the tune of Rs 500 crore annually.

While prices of liquor, particularly that of country-made liqour (CML), were doubled in comparison to that in the neighbouring states, manufacturers were allowed to have all the profit without sharing it with the government. While the MRP of a 750 ml country-made liquor bottle is proposed at Rs 96 this year in UP, the same is available at Rs 40-60 in Delhi, Haryana, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. This price discrepancy actually paved the way for large-scale inter-state smuggling of liquor.

As the manufacturers are handling wholesale trade also, the profit from smuggling is going into their kitty too.

Moreover, while excise duty remained constant at Rs 61.50 on a 750 ml CML bottle, now priced at Rs 96, the government has offered the cartel â€˜hiddenâ€™ profits by lifting controls. These benefits are extended to distilleries in the form of bottling and labelling charges (Rs 5.00), packing charges (0.70), Hologram fixation (0.13), freight (0.75), godown expenses (0.75) and profit at the rate of 2.5 per cent of wholesale cost price (1.84).

Ironically, while the state government realises Rs 4.50 on each 750 ml bottle, it pays Rs 5.52 to distilleries through non-existence components. As about 18.50 crore litres of CML is consumed every year in the state, the distilleries are pocketing about Rs 92 crore every month or Rs 1004 crore annually.

Significantly, under the earlier arrangement, all these components were under the government control and the manufacturers had to pay for them. What has raised eyebrows is that while government godowns are lying vacant, it is paying the distilleries for their godowns. Even packing, bottling, labelling and freight charges, which are part and parcel of any manufacturer, are being paid by the government to distilleries.

The liquor policy has resulted in a loss of Rs 496 crore in 2000-2001 on excise duty, which is second largest contributor to the state revenue after trade tax. If added with the â€˜unsharedâ€™ profit going to the distilleries, the revenue losses would be between Rs 1200-1500 crores.

Significantly, despite a noting by a senior excise official that â€œlet a popular government be formed to review the policyâ€�, the policy was hurrieldy extended for another year during the Presidentâ€™s rule allegedly under pressure from liquor barons, calling the shots from Delhi.

Heavy profits have attracted many liquor barons to the state and Uttar Pradesh has suddenly become a haven for liquor giants. Three new units have been set-up recently while few more are opening shortly. Even a former minister from eastern UP has moved papers to jump into the profitable liquor trade in the state.

4,Bypolls fortify BSP’s position,"LUCKNOW: In a major reversal for the Samajwadi Party, the Bahujan Samaj Party wrested the Baheri assembly seat from it. In addition the party also bagged the Jehangirganj assembly and the Akbarpur parliamentary seat.

The Debai assembly seat went to Rashtriya Kranti Party while in the Assembly segment of Kunda, where elections had been countermanded in February, independant candidate Raghuraj Pratap Singh alias Raja Bhaiyya emerged the winner.

Tribhuwan Dutt of the BSP bagged the Akbarpur parliamentary seat, vacated by chief minister Mayawati when she took the reins of governance in Uttar Pradesh.Of the total 1276944 votes in the constituency Dutt bagged 250405 (50.53%) defeating his nearest rival Munnulal Majhi of the Samajwadi Party who polled 218802 (44.15%) votes. Raj Bahadur of the Congress stood a poor third with 16111 (3.25%) votes.

In the Baheri assembly segment considered to be the stronghold of the Samajwadi Party, the BSP candidate Ata-ul-Rehman won the seat by polling 51650 (38.05 %)votes. Mumtaz Jehan of the Samajwadi Party got 43865 (32.31%) votes while Nand Lal Saran, an independant stood third. He got 18177 (13.39%) votes.

The BSPâ€™s winning spree was also evident in the Jehangirganj assembly segment from where Mayawati had contested in the February elections.

She had subsequently quit Jehangirganj in favour of Harora. Jai Ram Vimal of the BSP established a comfortable lead over his rival Bhim Prasad Sonkar of the Samajwadi Party. While Vimal polled 53533(48.77%) of the total 252517 votes, Sonkar got 44942 (40.93%) votes. The Congress candidate Arun got 8267 votes.

The Dibai assembly seat won by the RKP president Kalyan Singh and subsequently vacated by him was bagged by his son Rajvir Singh.

A debutant in politics Singh bagged 48017 (23.02)votes and thereby established a convincing victory over his nearest rival Ram Singh of the Bhartiya Janata Party. The BJP candidate polled 34485 (16.53%) votes.

For Raguhuraj Pratap Singh alias Raja Bhaiyya, the Kunda victory was a vidication of sorts. Elections to this constituency had been countermanded. Singh left his rivals Mohammad Sami of the Samajwadi Party and Yogendra Nath Mishra â€˜Maulaâ€™of the BSP way behind. While Raja Bhaiyya polled 88446 (82.13%) votes, Sami got 6768 (6.28%) votes and â€˜Maulaâ€™ 3583 (3.33%) votes.

5,City police arrest wanted robber,"PUNE: In a significant breakthrough, the Deccan police on Saturday arrested Lalit Mistry, 42, who was wanted in at least half a dozen cases theft and robbery committed in different localities of the city.

At a press conference, joint commissioner of police Mahesh Gauri said the Deccan police nabbed Mistry from the Ashoka hotel.

Gauri said Mistry, a suave, soft-spoken diploma engineer, took to crime after failing in his fatherâ€™s construction business.

His modus operandi was to carefully select flats occupied by old women, ensure that there was no male member around and then enter the house under some pretext and snatch jewellery.

Likewise, he used to take vehicles from sellers for a test ride and would never come back.

Though he was caught in 1998, he was back to his old habits again.

Mistry admitted to all his crimes at the press conference and even said he had kept record of all his misadventures on the Web! Deputy commissioner of police (Zone-1) Vinod Lokhande and senior PI of Deccan police station P.U. Kohinkar were also present.

They were able to nab Mistry by monitoring his Ashoka hotel room.

6,'Hijacked’ Cong bandh called off,"KOLKATA: The Pradesh Congress on Sunday announced the withdrawal of the proposed bandh on June 14.

Since the Trinamul Congress had â€œhijackedâ€� its issues, it had decided to call off the strike, argued state Congress president Pranab Mukherjee.

â€œA bandh is always a weapon of last resort. When a particular political party calls a bandh, other parties decide to support or oppose it on the basis of the issues involved.

This is political decency,â€� Mukherjee told the media after the PCC meeting.

The decision was taken in view of the hardships the common people had to face in view of bandhs in successive weeks, he said.

â€œThe issues being the same, the bandh called by the Trinamul is an unprecedented political gimmick,â€� retorted Mukherjee.

The call was given to demand the state governmentâ€™s intervention as the farmers were being deprived of the minimum support price for paddy, hike in agricultural taxes, delay in teachersâ€™ salaries, rise in electricity bills and the delay in preparing the list of people below the poverty line.

â€œThe issues still remain relevant.

The Congress will organise demonstrations at the district magistratesâ€™ offices on June 14, highlighting the issues,â€� said Mukherjee.

A rally in Kolkata will be held on June 24 to decide on the next phase of agitations, he declared.

7,Bukhari to launch political party,"HYDERABAD: The Shahi Imam of Delhiâ€™s Jama Masjid, Syed Ahmed Bukhari is all set to launch a political party to represent the Muslim community.

â€œAb waqt aa gaya hai ke Musalmanon ki ek siyasi jamaat honi chahiye (the time has come for Muslims to have their own political party,â€� Bukhari told The Times of India on Saturday. â€œInstead of supporting the so-called secular parties, Muslims should strengthen themselves to take their share in power,â€� he said.

â€œWhen Hindus, Sikhs, Dalits and other communities can have their own political parties,why canâ€™t Muslims form a party of their own,â€� he asked. Bukhari has already begun touring the country to generate public opinion in favour of a Muslim political party. So far, he has visited West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, and plans to visit other parts of the country soon.

The proposed party will neither be a federation of existing political or religious groups, nor an extension of regional parties representing the Muslim community. It will be a national party which will work in coordination with the existing regional parties and groups,â€� Bukhari clarified. But the Shahi Imam does not plan to hold any post in the proposed party, and his role will be confined to that of adviser. â€œWe would have named the party by now.

But it got delayed for the reason that I do not want to hold any post in the party,â€� he said. Bukhari also wants the youth to replace the existing Muslim leaders. Unhe (old leaders) ab sirf dua karni chahiye (they should now be confined to prayers), he said. â€œIt is after more than 50 years that we thought of launching a Muslim political party. Now it will take some more time for its formation,â€� he said, adding that he has already spoken to several Muslim leaders on the issue.

He said the leadership should come from the grassroot level from all parts of the country. Main apna mazhabi farz pura kar raha hoon (I am fulfilling my religious duty),â€� said the Shahi Imam, clarifying his motive for launching a party. The Shahi Imam refused to accept the All India Muslim Personal Law Board as an authority to represent the Muslim community.

â€œIt was formed to deal with matters related to personal law, and it should be confined to that.â€� He criticised the board for involving the Muslim community in the issue of â€˜shila pujaâ€™ at Ayodhya, saying that the dispute was originally between the VHP and the Central government over the undisputed land. But the board leaders unnecessarily involved the community by holding talks with Shankaracharya Jayendra Saraswati.

9,Akalis fear election violence,"BATHINDA: After eating humble pie in corporation elections, the Akali rank and file is apprehensive of aggression in zila parishad and block samiti elections.

Former Punjab chief minister Parkash Singh Badal on Sunday termed the panchayat election process a complete farce as the party candidates are allegedly being threatened by the police to withdraw from the contest.

About 20 SAD candidates of Gidderbaha block, who are contesting block samiti elections, organised a press conference in Bathinda on Sunday under the aegis of Manpreet Badal, the media in charge of SAD(B) and MLA from Gidderbaha.

The contenders for the election alleged that the area police raided their houses on Saturday morning, the last day for withdrawal of the nomination papers, and threatened them to withdraw from the contest or surrender their claim in favour of Congress candidates.

Failing which the police warned the SAD candidates entangling in fake cases of smuggling of poppy husk and distilling illicit liquor, alleged Manpreet Badal.

Many Akali candidates including Jagdev Kaur, Paramjeet Kaur, Bakhshish Singh, Naseeb Kaur, Chhinder Kaur and Surjit Singh alleged during the press conference here that they were threatened by Avtar Singh, the additional station house officer and Surjit Singh, an ASI at Kot Bhai police station to withdraw from the election.

Terming the election process a complete subversion of democratic set-up, Manpreet alleged that the returning officers from Malout and Gidderbaha had rejected the papers of Akali candidates on flimsy ground on Saturday.

The papers of Gurraj Singh, a candidate from Alamwala under Malout block were rejected by the returning officer by attaching a withdrawal himself after faking the signature of the candidate, alleged Manpreet.

Meanwhile, talking over telephone with media persons during the press conference from an unknown place, Parkash Singh Badal alleged that the nomination papers of SC/ST candidates of Akalis were rejected in Moga and Gurdaspur for being deficient in necessary documents.

But the necessary documents like the caste certificates were removed by the returning officers themselves after the candidates submitted complete nomination papers, alleged Badal.

Manpreet said though the Akalis were passing through a harrowing time after the Congress unleashed political repression, the party would contest the panchayat body elections with full zeal and maintain its hold on rural elected bodies.

When contacted at his residence, Muktsar district police chief was not available for comment.

10,Writ against PU selections dismissed,"CHANDIGARH: The Punjab and Haryana High Court has dismissed the writ petition preferred against the selection of some lecturers and readers by Panjab University (PU) Chandigarh in its department of political science as also in the directorate of correspondence studies in 1999.

The selection and appointment had been challenged in the nature of quo warranto by Veena Kumari of the Lawyersâ€™ Initiative, alleging that the selections were not free from arbitrariness.

While seeking directions to quash the appointments, the petitioner who filed a public interest litigation (PIL) under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, alleging that in some cases appointment of lecturers and readers were made without advertising the posts while in others these were made in violation of mandatory provisions of university regulations.

Thus as such the persons were usurpers of public offices.

Besides the registrar of the university, the respondents included Emanuel Nahar, Swaranjit Kaur and Shukla from the directorate of correspondence studies and Pompa Mukherji, Anupama Roy, Deepak Kumar Singh, Navjot Kaur and Ashutosh Kumar from the department of political science.

11,Talks with panel only if farmers released: Nain,"CHANDIGARH: Even as an uneasy calm prevailed on Sunday in violence-hit Jind district, which has been witnessing frequent clashes between the police and agitating farmers for the last two weeks, Bhartiya Kisan Unionâ€™s Haryana unit president Ghasi Ram Nain clarified that the BKU would hold talks with the four-member committee constituted by chief minister Om Prakash Chautala on Saturday only if arrested farmers were released.

He is reported to have told mediapersons in Kandela that Prem Singh Dahiya and Prithvi Singh Gorakhpuria, with whom the committee is scheduled to hold talks on Tuesday, were not representatives of the BKU, which is spearheading the ongoing farmersâ€™ agitation in the state.

In fact, the BKU is yet to receive an invitation for talks from the four-member committee, headed by finance minister Sampat Singh.

The CM, on Saturday, said that in Gurgaon he had received messages from Bhartiya Kisan leader Prem Singh Dahiya and Prithvi Singh Gorkhpuria of the CPM for talks to resolve farmersâ€™ problems.

By holding talks with organisations other than the BKU, the chief minister was trying to hoodwink the farming community, said Nain, adding that it also proved that he was not serious about resolving their problems.

The Haryana Vikas Party (HVP), led by former chief minister Bansi Lal, has opposed the constitution of the four-member committee.

The party, in a statement, observed that it would have been more appropriate had the chief minister held talks directly with the farmersâ€™ leaders.

The party also clarified that it was not in favour of the farmersâ€™ demand for free power and water, but at the same time it condemned police firing on agitating farmers.

Meanwhile, vehicular traffic on roads leading to Jind remained paralysed with agitating farmers refusing to lift their blockades.

They have, however, decided not to block national highway no 1 in view of military movement on it.

As many as seven farmers have so far lost their lives in police firing and other clashes in their agitation in support of their demands for release of their arrested leaders and waiver of power arrears.

The agitation took an ugly turn when the state government refused to release arrested BKU activists following the release of seven persons, including two DSPs, taken hostage by the farmers at Kandela.

While the BKU alleges that the government has gone back on its promise made under the deal to release hostages, the government denies it.

12,Hand Gujarat riot cases to CBI: NHRC,"AHMEDABAD: Will a majority of the rioters go scot free if the investigations into the recent communal riots remain in the hands of the agencies of the Gujarat government?

This is a vital underlying question running through the voluminous final report of the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) released on Friday.

The nature of investigations into the recent communal riots in Gujarat have come under the close scrutiny of various agencies, most recently the NHRC, which has called for a CBI inquiry into major carnage cases to ensure impartiality.

""The Commission would like to underline that it is a central principle in the administration of criminal justice that those against whom allegations are made should not themselves be entrusted with the investigation of those allegations. It has universally been the practice to act on this principle, including in this country,"" the NHRC observed in its final report.

In view of the widespread allegations that FIRs had been poorly or wrongly recorded and that investigations had been ''influenced'' by extraneous considerations or players, the Commission had stated that the integrity of the process had to be restored.

It had, therefore, recommended that certain critical cases, including five that it had specifically mentioned, be entrusted to the CBI.

However, the Narendra Modi government seems to be in no mood to let go off the investigations. The State Government responded on April 12 to the NHRC saying ""An investigation conducted by the state police cannot be discredited, cannot be put into disrepute and its fairness questioned merely on the basis of hostile propaganda.""

It added that transference of these cases to the CBI would ""indefinitely delay the investigation"" and help the accused persons to get bail. It also stated that the CBI is already understaffed and over-burdened.

The NHRC has, however, observed that in respect of the cases listed by the Commission for CBI investigations, the allegations of inaction, or complicity by the elements of the state apparatus were grave and severely damaging to its credibility and integrity.

""It would thus be a travesty of the principles of criminal justice if such cases were not transferred to the CBI. Worse still, the inability to do so could severely compromise the fundamental rights to life, liberty, equality and dignity guaranteed by the Constitution to all of the people of India on a non-discriminatory basis.""

The Centre, in its response to the NHRC''s request for a CBI probe, has stated that under existing rules, the CBI can take up the investigation of cases only if the state government addresses and appropriately requests the CBI to do so.

The NHRC, however, responded that it was emphatically of the view that the role of the Central government in respect of the investigation of the cases identified by the Commission should go beyond a mere invocation of the ''existing rules'' in respect of when the CBI can take up a case for investigation.

13,Danapur bypolls a mockery: BJP,"PATNA: The BJP has dubbed the Danapur by-elections as a political sham.

State spokesperson of the party Kiran Ghai alleged that RJD ministers, MLAs and the administration made a mockery of the electoral process. The malpractices practised there were done in an organised manner. BJP workers staged a dharna demading the cancellation of elections. The leader of the Opposition in the assembly, Sushil Kumar Modi, alleged that the government machinery was misused for rigging the by-election. He alleged that RJD supporters distributed 50,000 fake â€˜residential certificatesâ€™ on the polling day and ensured bogus voting.

The BJP candidate from Danapur, Satyanarayn Singh, alleged that the by-elections were completely rigged by the government machinery and criminals. He pointed out that till BJP leaders contested the police version that the slain trader was killed at a liquor shop and demanded the arrest of the culprits allegedly believed to be Billu Paswan and Arvind, both RJD supporters.

They also alleged that the police had opened fire at peaceful demonstrators which led to the killing of Rajesh Kumar. They demanded adequate security for the family of the bereaved and compensation to the next of kin. NCP leader Nawal Kishore Shahi charged RJD and NDA with indulging in malpractices to defeat party candidate in Chhatapur.

14,No arrest made in State Bank case,"PATNA: The police are yet to arrest the five accused named in the FIR lodged by the Raj Bhavan branch of the State Bank of India (SBI) with the Secretariat police station on March 23 in connection with the fraudulent withdrawal of about Rs 27 lakh from the bank in February last.

The accused include the then branch manager of the SBIâ€™s Raj Bhavan branch, Bipin Bihari Pathak, and an assistant, Prem Prakash. The other three accused are Kaushlesh Ranjan, Prabha Sinha and Pankaj Prasun. The officer in charge of the Secretariat PS said on Sunday that while four of the accused, including Prem, are absconding, Pathak is now posted outside Patna. The police investigation is going on, he added.

Though the SBIâ€™s vigilance wing has urged the CBI to take necessary action, it is unlikely to take up the investigation of the case as the bank has already lodged the FIR with the police. Normally, the banks first inform the CBI about such matters.

Prem, according to the FIR, presented a cheque of Rs 21 lakh drawn by Pankaj, an account holder in the UCO Bankâ€™s Mukherjeenagar (Delhi) branch, in favour of Prabha on February 21, which was allowed by Pathak to be credited to the joint account of Prem and Prabha without clearance. Prabha is said to be the mother of Prem. The same day almost the entire amount was withdrawn by Prem with the help of Prabha.

The SBI authorities were taken aback when the Rs 21-lakh cheque presented by Prem was returned unpaid from the drawee branch in Delhi. On February 26, according to the FIR, Pathak allowed a cheque of Rs 4.5 lakh signed by Prem and drawn on the Canara Bankâ€™s Pataliputra Colony branch to be credited to Kaushleshâ€™s account. Kaushlesh drew Rs 4.5 lakh from the branch. Again, the cheque of Rs 4.5 lakh was returned unpaid from clearance.

To cover up the unauthorised withdrawals of about Rs 25 lakh, Prem brought a letter purported to be signed by Mahavir Prasad requesting the Raj Bhavan branch to credit the proceeds of his five special term deposit receipts (STDRs) to the account of Prabha. Pathak allowed premature payment of the STDRs and these were credited to the account of Prem and Prabha. Then Prem withdrew Rs 1.5 lakh from the bank.

In a communication to the bank on March 9, Prasad, a senior Jharkhand government officer, and his wife, Shikha Prasad, while describing the letter as fake, alleged that the premature payment of their STDRs was made without their knowledge and consent.

15,RJD wins bypolls in state,"PATNA: The ruling RJD has reasons to celebrate as its candidate in the Danapur assembly by-polls, Ramanand Yadav, crushed his nearest BJP rival, Satya Narayan Singh, by a huge margin of over 58,000 votes while the party managed to retain the Chhatapur reserved seat with its candidate Gauri Shankar Sardar defeating his nearest JD(U) rival Vishwamohan Bharatiya by a wafer-thin margin of 237 votes.

The by-poll results were announced on Sunday. The Danapur assembly seat had fallen vacant due to the resignation of RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav on his election to the Rajya Sabha.

The Chhatapur reserved assembly seat had fallen vacant due to the death of sitting RJD MLA Geeta Sardar.

The huge margin of victory of the RJD candidate in Danapur has come as a pleasant surprise for the party. In the last assembly elections, Laloo could win the seat by a margin of a little over 18,000 votes. Ramanand Yadav, who switched his loyalty from the BJP to the RJD at the last moment, has finally been able to return to the assembly after a gap of more than seven years.

In between, he got defeated thrice â€” two times as an RJD candidate and once as a BJP candidate. Though the RJD victory was anticipated in the political circles of Bihar, the margin of victory in Danapur has surprised even its opponents. They say the BJP has never faced such a humiliating defeat in the recent past. The BJP had fielded a controversial candidate â€” Satya Narayan Singh faces several criminal charges including that of murder â€” apparently in the hope that he would be able to take on the â€œmuscle powerâ€� of the RJD candidate.

However, the ploy seems to have boomeranged with even the traditional BJP voters showing little enthusiasm for its candidate. On the polling day, the street battle was largely confined to RJD men and the followers of Satya Narayan Singh. There was a low turnout of voters in the urban areas of Danapur constituency, which were considered to be the BJP stronghold.

The BJP now accuses the RJD-led government of resorting to electoral malpractice like issuing of â€œfake residential certificatesâ€� and â€œterror tacticsâ€� to frighten its voters.

16,Gujarat violence planned: PUDR,"NEW DELHI: People''s Union for Democratic Rights (Pudr), a leading human rights organisation, on Saturday alleged that the Gujarat riots were not an outcome of the Godhra incident as the ""planning"" had begun much earlier and charged the state government with complicity in the violence.

Demanding a CBI probe into major incidents of communal violence and dismissal of the Narendra Modi government, the Pudr expressed doubts over Modi government''s intentions with regard to taking action against the perpetrators of riots. It also termed as ""miserable"" the government''s rehabilitation policy.

""Given the systematic way the Modi government has sabotaged the registration of criminal cases arising from the communal violence, there is little chance of the guilty being brought to book,"" PUDR secretary Shashi Saxena said.

He also released a report compiled after a Pudr team''s visit to the state from April 5 to 14. He demanded proper registration of crimes and arrest of the guilty, handing over of the probe to the CBI, making mandatory for the state to provide material support to the relief camps, allowing displaced people to stay in camps till they are adequately settled and ensuring security, livelihood and humane living conditions for all the displaced people.

""Planning for attacks against the minority community had begun much before February 27 (when Godhra incident occurred),"" the Pudr said. ""There had been a steady build-up of meetings, distribution of leaflets etc over the last two years, all propagating hatred and myths about the minority community,"" it added.

""After the Godhra incident, meetings were held in villages on February 27 and 28 to plan the details of the attacks. The use of similar methods across districts, such as swords of the same brand and gas cylinders, and the fact that the same mob went from place to place over a couple of days with impunity is further evidence of planning,"" it said.

It said burning ""seems to have been the preferred method (of rioters), so as not to leave evidence."" ""The fact that the Gujarat government supported the bandh of February 28 and March one despite its experience of large-scale violence against the minority community after a similar bandh in 2000, is evidence of its complicity in the violence right from the start,"" the Pudr alleged.

It also alleged ""deliberate failure"" on part of the police to contain violence.

18,Govt can veto VSNL's TTL investment,"KOLKATA: The Union government can block the special resolution needed to be passed for shareholders'' approval for the VSNL board''s decision to invest Rs 1200 crore in Tata Teleservices.

Company analysts said the Tatas would have to pass a special resolution for shareholders'' approval as required under Section 372 (A) of the Companies Act.

The special resolution would have to obtain 75 per cent votes of VSNL shareholders in order to be valid, which according to analysts, was unlikely as government was holding 34 per cent equity in the telecom major.

As the Union Communications Minister, Pramod Mahajan, had already expressed dissatisfaction over the Tatas'' decision to utilise VSNL''s reserves for TTL, the government was most likely to veto the decision at the general meeting of the shareholders, which would have to be convened by the VSNL board, now under the management control of the Tatas, they said.

The other option left before the government was that it can approach the Company Law Board under Section 397 and 398 of the Companies Act, citing ""oppression of minority and mismanagement"" by the Tatas.

In either case, the relationship between the Tatas and the government would definitely turn sour, and is likely to send affect the future disinvestment efforts of the Centre.

Analysts said if the Tatas were allowed to use VSNL''s reserves within of getting management control, then other private companies which were actively participating in the disinvestment process would feel encouraged to adopt similar moves.

In such a case, the reserves of PSUs, which had been built up over the years with public money, would be at the mercy of the private players, they opined.

However, in VSNL''s case, such fears mighr not be true as the Tata group was known for its good business practices, analysts said.

22,"India rules out tripartite talks with Russia, Pak","ALMATY: India ruled out tripartite talks with Russia and Pakistan Monday, but said it was willing to take ""appropriate steps"" to avoid a conflict in South Asia if promises made by Islamabad were verifiably carried out.

""I don''t want to indulge in wishful thinking,"" said Brajesh Mishra, India''s national security advisor and Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee''s principal secretary, in response to a question on whether India would participate in any tripartite talks with Russia and Pakistan.

Russian President Vladmir Putin has offered to mediate between the two sides at a regional summit in Kazakhstan and will meet both leaders separately on Tuesday in an attempt to initiate contact.

Asked about Putin''s reported proposal for peace talks, Mishra said: ""We have a very clear understanding about what Putin said. He was not talking about a tripartite meeting.""

The senior official also ruled out any lower level talks. ""The world wants to avoid a conflict between India and Pakistan. So do we,"" Mishra said.A million soldiers have been deployed along the border since December last year when armed militants attacked the Indian parliament. Fourteen people, including the militants, died in the attack.

Tensions have recently flared up again with the May 14 attack by three armed militants on a passenger bus and an army camp in Jammu, Kashmir''s winter capital. Thirty-five mostly women and children, were killed in the attack.

Mishra said that Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf had made certain promises which had been conveyed to India through Britain and the United States but these needed to be verified before New Delhi would withdraw its troops from the border.

""General Musharraf has made some promises. These promises have also been conveyed to us by other countries like the United States and United Kingdom. If these promises are implemented on the ground and implementation could be verified, then we are willing to take appropriate steps,"" Mishra said.

The official stressed that the emphasis was on implementation. ""Because as we all know that on January 12, General Musharraf made several promises. One of these were that no terrorist organisation would be allowed to use Pakistani soil for terrorism in Kashmir.""

After the December attack, facing renewed international pressure, Musharraf announced a radical shift in Pakistan''s Kashmir policy, promising its territory would not be used for any ""terrorist activities.""

""In February there was a downturn in militant activity but in March, April and May there were 300 incidents each month, and 300 people were killed in each month. So, something that could be controlled in February was allowed to increase March-May. This gives us cause to look at the new promises very carefully,"" Mishra said.

Earlier in the day, Indian Deputy Foreign Minister Omar Abdullah also ruled out direct talks with Pakistan. ""Our position is very clear -- we are ready to meet Pakistan halfway but violence in Kashmir must come down, infiltration must come down,"" Abdullah said ahead of the CICA (Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia) which opens in Almaty on Tuesday.

""If on the ground the situation improves, we can consider talking,"" Abdullah said. ""Three thousand terrorists are waiting at the LOC (line of control). We have to see whether they come or not,"" he said.

Both Vajpayee and Musharraf are due to address the CICA summit Tuesday which will provide the next platform for the warring neighbours to express their grievances.

24,LS panel asks Punjab to note farmers' plight,"CHANDIGARH: The standing committee on finance of the Lok Sabha, on Monday, called upon Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh to assess the ground realities regarding the problems faced by the farming community in the state.

While taking part in the deliberations, the chief minister said that a major chunk of the farming community, roughly 52 per cent, was that of small and marginal farmers having landholdings between 2 to 2.5 acres and meagre resources. He said diversification was the only answer to switch over from the traditional farming of sowing wheat and paddy to high value-added cash crops such as oilseeds, vegetables and fruits. He urged the central government not to dismantle the existing Minimum Support Price (MSP) system in the larger interest of the farming community. Amarinder Singh said that if the Government of India wanted to do away with the existing system of MSP then they should first of all give five to seven years for the plan for diversification to take effect.

Responding to the suggestions put forth by the state government, Janardhana Reddy, chairman of the committee, asked the Punjab government to submit a detailed report before the committee.

25,"As govt turns blind eye, BU can't enforce quality","BANGALORE: ``The committee could not trace the college at the given address. Hence, it has no comments to offer.''''

``Since we did not find anybody at the college, we returned. Surprisingly, nobody contacted us for a revisit.''''

These are excerpts from the local inquiry committees'' (LIC) reports on affiliated colleges of Bangalore University which were accepted by the university academic council and forwarded to the state government last week.

A cursory glance of the reports reflect the poor quality of many affiliated colleges. Shockingly, they continue to function.

An angry member remarked at the meeting: ``These colleges are cheating the people and the university in the guise of providing education. Forget about providing education, they have no business to exist in the first place. The government and the university should ruthlessly close them down and not allow innocent students to get cheated.''''

It is true many of these colleges function with the patronage of politicians and have no qualms about it. Managements use their clout with the government and the university to get affiliation. Even if the university denies affiliation to colleges without infrastructure, the government simply sets aside the recommendations and grants affiliation to these colleges.

Therefore, Vice-Chancellor M.S. Thimmappa said the university was keen on framing statutes. ``Once the government approves statutes on affiliation, it is binding on the government. I don''t agree that all colleges are bad, though some are bad and should be closed down,'''' he said.

L. Vasudeva Murthy, inquiry committee member, said, ``The LICs have no power to make recommendations but can only make observations. The government sets aside the observations and grants affiliation. What is the point in continuing with the ritual of college inspections?'''' he asked.

A joint action by a strong-willed government and the university is what is needed to improve collegiate education.
