0,Contract R&D grows with drug development,"MUMBAI: The focus on new drug development by pharmaceutical firms is leading to a boom in contract research.

While big companies like Dr Reddyâ€™s, Ranbaxy, Cipla, and Nicholas Piramal stand to gain with their separate units, smaller pharma firms and testing labs too are pinning their hopes on the growing contract research business.

â€˜â€˜In India, clinical trial is a $150-200 million market. With clinical trial activity cheaper by 30 per cent here than in the West, India provides the opportunity to recruit faster and retain better,â€™â€™ said an official with Quintiles, a $1.5 billion clinical research organisation (CRO) which started drug trials in India in the late 1990s.

CROs developing new drugs is turning out to be the next money spinning industry. By 2010, India will get 20 per cent of the global CRO revenue, around Rs 50,000 crore. The CRO industry, which notched up revenues of Rs 550 crore in 2003, is estimated to be growing at almost 100 per cent.

Off late, there has been a lot of action on the CRO front. While Quintiles has ramped up production, Nicholas Piramal is expanding the capacity of its CRO, WellQuest. Lotus Labs and Vimta Lamda, which started of as small ventures conducting bio-equivalence studies, have also got into clinical studies for MNC drug firms. Bangalore-based Lotus Labs is catering to the domestic sector, too, as M A Karthikeya points out, â€˜â€˜Indian pharma firms are aggressively introducing new generics in foreign markets, which require extensive clinical studies.â€™â€™

He said decision to follow WTO norms will spur the CRO industry.

Clinical testing laboratory SRL Ranbaxy has also embarked on two clinical trial projects for Atlanta Pharma, a US-based CRO and European pharma company. The firm has already undertaken contract clinical trials for Pfizer, Eli Lilly and Johnson and Johnson, besides domestic companies such as Wockhardt and Ranbaxy.

Industry sources said that two thirds of the total global R&D cost of $40 billion is invested in drug development. Outsourcing of clinical and pre-clinical research accounts for nearly $13 billion. Of this, about $9 billion is allocated for contractual research.

1,BJP shining as Ravindra joins party smiling,"BANGALORE: Adding to the growing list of former bureaucrats throwing their hats into the political arena, former chief secretary A Ravindra joined the BJP on Monday, lauding the NDA government for heralding economic growth and focussing on development and governance.

Speaking to reporters, Ravindra, however, said he would not contest the elections. ""I am more interested in what happens between elections,"" he added.

Justifying his decision to join politics, Ravindra said the political arena was witnessing discernible changes with all parties talking of development and governance. All right thinking persons and intellectuals of the educated class should cash in on this development.

Asked why join a political party for this, Ravindra said: ""Political reforms should begin from a political party which will be translated into bills and legislation. With 37 years of administrative experience, politics provides a broad spectrum to do public service.""

Stating that the BJP national leadership was ""extremely good"", Ravindra said it provided inspiration and confidence for a better future. The second-rung leadership was also dynamic and forward looking which emanated hope and confidence.

Welcoming Ravindra to the party fold, state unit president Ananth Kumar said he would prepare a ""vision document"" for Karnataka.

Kumar announced the election committee comprising B.S. Yediyurappa, Jagadish Shettar, D.H. Shankarmurthy, Basavaraj Patil Sedam, M.R. Tanga, Ramachandra Gowda, Basavanagouda Patil Yatnal, K.S.Eshwarappa, Ramesh C. Jigajinagi, Taradevi Siddhartha, Aravind Limbavali, D.V.Sadananda Gowda, Mukhyamantri Chandru and Shivayogi Swamy.

2,Let all your wild fantasies run riot here,"BANGALORE: It seems to be a fantasy for former Mayor K. Chandrashekar. He is creating another marvel, the Fantasy Park, on a sprawling 20-acre land in Hanumanthnagar, at a cost of Rs 7 crore.

Here, you can literally dance to your tunes, thanks to the sensor-based dancing area, where the sound, light and the fountain will synchronise with your footsteps.

The sensor-based dancing floor which will be 120 feet in height and 118 feet in width will be the first in India, based on the Singapore pattern. If you clap, it will clap back, if you say happy birthday, it will say happy birthday, and the children and old people can all have fun alike.

The fantasy park, on the lines of the Santosa Islands in Singapore, will also have a wedding dance, which is programmed by a computer software.

Christened the Raj Kumar Fantasy Park for children, it has plans to have a train run, both elevated and underground, an Egyptian Spynx, half-a-km water boating, a unique landscaping design with a mix of Korean grass, Mexican grass, Bermuda grass, elephant grass, a walking track, a zig-zag walking path with anti-skid tiles, having a 1,000 trees planted, a 40 feet dinosaur for five dinosaur song and light show, a cracker slide, a coconut slide, electrical flower fountain, and a glass house where birthdays could be celebrated.

There will of course be food courts and lots of animals and bird statues, and for the computer-age children to come to reality, a mud area to play on, says Chandrashekar.

3,Court overrules L-G's order,"NEW DELHI: The Delhi High Court has set aside the lieutenant-governor''s (L-G) order which had directed the withdrawal of a 12-year-old attempt to murder case against BJP workers.

BJP leaders Jolly Khosla, Chander Prakash Khosla and Sunil Khosla have been accused of rioting during the 1991 elections. On May 20, 1991, the three allegedly attempted to kill their rival party''s volunteers at the Sarojini Nagar polling booth station.

Justice R S Sodhi recently upheld a lower court''s order and said: ""The sessions judge was absolutely right in not permitting the State from withdrawing the case.""

Sodhi confirmed the order of additional sessions judge V K Jain who had said that a criminal case cannot be withdrawn when it is on the final stages because it would mean thwarting the course of administration.

The charges against the three were framed on July 21, 1992. All the witnesses had been examined and the accused were getting their defence statement recorded when an application was moved last year on behalf of the L-G.

4,No clue in minister's missing granddaughters,"PATNA: The police are yet to trace the alleged kidnappers of four granddaughters of state revenue minister Ramai Ram on Monday though they are missing for the last four days.

It is apprehended that they are held captive by a teenaged boy, Umar, who is the grandson of a retired ADM, and his accomplices.

The matter has become serious as Vijay Kumar, father of the girls, Ujjwal Rani, Shweta Rani, Khusbhu Rani and Varuni, has lodged a case of kidnapping with the Secretariat police station.

On Monday, Ramâ€™s staff maintained that the girls had been kidnapped and added that their mother, Geeta Devi, RJD MLC, is in a state of shock and she is not in a position to talk to the press. Patna police have brought Umarâ€™s father, Arshad Gani, from Siwan to Patna. The police examined Gani who told the police that he is not aware of the whereabouts of Umar.

Despite several attempts, Ramai Ram could not be contacted for his comments about the alleged kidnapping. On Sunday, Ramâ€™s staff at his residence had told the TNN that he was away to Muzaffarpur to attend a marriage.

But on Monday, someone on Ramâ€™s phone said that Ram had actually gone to Muzaffarpur on Sunday to search his missing granddaughters.

On Monday, a police team was sent to Ranchi to trace another youth, Vishal, who had allegedly made threatening call to the girlsâ€™ father asking him to refrain from lodging any case with the police regarding the disappearance of his daughters.

The Patna police is investigating the case from different angles which includes the possibility of kidnapping. Another possibility is that the girls might have eloped with Umar, who was a classmate of Ujjwal Rani in Don Bosco Academy last year. Ujjwal Rani later joined a school at Mussoorie while Umar was admitted to Plus Two in Loyola School, Patna.

6,Kolkata not on the bandh-wagon,"KOLKATA: Bandhs belong to Kolkata''s regressive past. The only way to deal with them is to cripple them, bring them to a halt, indeed paralyse them with all the subversive methods with which they have stymied West Bengal''s progress for decades.

Last August, the Supreme Court banned strikes by government employees not because it loved trade-unions less, but because it loved citizens more.

Forget workers'' rights, CITU has called this bandh to protest this judgment only to protect its own blunted clout.

Returning to Kolkata after two years, I am stunned â€” and lost. Plateglass phoenixes have risen from the old crumbling landmarks. The city is learning to let go of the illusory grandeur of a crumbling jalsaghar.

Nostalgia is no longer the city''s most thriving industry. It has decided to wake up and smell the coffee, even if that means replacing a mansion with a mall dispensing Starbucks.

Yes, the older avenues are still patina-ed with a genteel desperation, but now they seem to be actually awaiting the bulldozer rather than being trapped forever in degradation. For the first time in years, Kolkata is looking forward in hope instead of looking back in delusion.

And then, along comes another bandh, trying to turn back the clock. What point is there in the State having an IT minister who won''t stand up for the Motherboard of all Hopes, and instead downplays the blow to West Bengal''s precarious new image?

The competition is cut-throat. It can indeed take only a day for a call centre to become a wrong number.

The State''s minders have to decide whether they want to hunt with the market or to run with the tired old slogans.

The sweeping flyovers, the Intelligent City at Salt Lake, the new entrepreneurial spirit, the return of the flight of capital, and of international flights â€” Kolkatans are revelling in the new writing on the mall.

They shouldn''t let a bunch of has-beens sabotage a long-delayed future.

7,"SC snubs govt, lends an ear to forests","NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday temporarily halted Prime Minister Vajpayee''s widely advertised ""revolutionary steps"" to regularise vast encroachments by tribal people in the thick forests of Madhya Pradesh and Tripura.

Giving a jolt to the NDA government just before the Lok Sabha election, a Bench of Chief Justice V N Khare, Justices Y K Sabharwal and Arijit Pasayat stayed several orders to regularise encroachments in forests jeopardising over two lakh hectares of forest.

Counsel Harish Salve, who is assisting the court in certain public interest matters, had brought to the court''s attention an advertisement issued by the Centre.

The advertisement, ''Revolutionary steps taken by Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee'', highlighted the PM''s decision to grant land rights to tribal people who have been staying in forest areas prior to December 31, 1993.

The Bench issued a notice to the Centre and said the decisions taken in regard to ""dereserving"" the forest land in Madhya Pradesh and Tripura ""be not implemented."" It asked the Centre to file its reply within four weeks.

The Bench refused to accept solicitor-general Kirit N Raval''s plea for some time to examine the issue and take corrective measures if something wrong had happened.

""If the decisions are made inoperative for three months, then nobody would insist on its implementation,"" the court added.

8,Karnal gets ready for LS polls,"KARNAL: The returning officer for Karnal Parliamentary seat RS Doon who is also Deputy Commissioner of Karnal initiated steps on Monday evening for smooth holding of the coming Lok Sabha poll.

Doon called for a meeting of all political parties and senior officials who are likely to be involved in poll programme to discuss steps for fair and violence-free poll.

In the meeting DC suggested that rates should be fixed for space to be utilized by political parties for holding poll meetings. Likewise, the parties holding meetings should also pay for electricity consumption by applying for temporary electricity meters at the venue. The returning officer offered that administration was ready to provide drinking water at venue of poll meetings for public convenience.

However, TNN learns that proposal was shot down by Jai Prakash Gupta local MLA on plea that these were not practicable. Gupta who was one of the participants maintained that expenditure on rent for holding election meetings would be added to the expenditure allowed by Election Commission of India which was already very meager.

The political parties should be allowed to fend for themselves for holding meetings. Similarly proposal of fitting temporary electric meters was also not found feasible as present practice by political parties was to get metered supply through owner of shops at election meeting venues. Interestingly, only Zile Ram Chochra- Congress representative along with independent MLA attended the meeting.

There was none to represent BJP, INLD, Lok Shakti and other motley group of parties. DC asked officials to start foul proof measures from now onwards for undisturbed poll.

9,Parties yet to submit accounts for '99 polls,"NEW DELHI: Notwithstanding the growing demand for transparency in campaign spending, many political parties are resisting the requirement to submit their books to the Election Commission.

This was revealed by Election Commission spokesperson A N Jha at his daily briefing on Monday.

He said that some political parties were yet to submit their accounts of expenditure made during the 1999 general elections.

On proxy voting, the Election Commission spokesperson said it would only be available for service electors who are part of the armed forces.

But the facility would not be available to their wives. Embassy staff would also not have proxy voting rights.

Jha said the Commission is inquiring into the information about education, criminal record, assets and liabilities of candidates given in their affidavits. From the Gujarat election onwards, â€˜â€˜we are inquiring into information furnished by themâ€™â€™, Jha said, adding, â€˜â€˜It takes time.â€™â€™

In case the information is wrong, the returning officer can take the winning candidate to court but he cannot be disqualified. â€˜â€˜That is for the court to decide,â€™â€™ he said.

Giving an account of how electronic voting machines are going to help, Jha said the number of booths would come down from 7.75 lakh in 1999 to seven lakh this time. Besides, the number of voters for each polling booth would go up from nearly 700 in 1999 to 970-1000.

Also, there would be a 10 per cent decrease in poll staff.

10,No BPO outcry after polls: US think tanks,"NEW DELHI: Leading US institutions are advising India to keep low profile while combating backlash against the outsourcing, which has become a political issue in the US.

Think tanks from the US are confident that American firms will continue to benefit from outsourcing to India and the current uproar will be a non-issue after the US presidential elections in November.

""India should keep quiet and should not exaggerate much. What''s important for India is to continue doing the good job,"" says Clyde Prestowitz Jr, president Economic Strategy Institute.

Backlash against outsourcing in the US was the talking point at the CII-East West Centre''s Asia Pacific Executive Forum, which deliberated on the changing world order and India, in a regional and global context. Many believe that anti-outsourcing bills in the US are likely to be ineffective and could end up costing more US jobs than they save.

""Outsourcing is not an economic problem, but an economic opportunity,"" says Charles E Morrison, president East West Centre.

""Jobs lost to offshoring were less than a quarter of all jobs lost in the US in 2002. The rest were lost to corporate restructuring. The current debate in the US on offshoring is informed by lack of facts,"" says Michael T Clark, ED, US India Business Council.

He added that a legal framework protecting intellectual property and grievance redressal measures were required in India.

Indian industry body Nasscom has been advocating low profile strategy to deal with outsourcing.

11,EC lays down the line on political advertisements,"NEW DELHI: The Election Commission on Tuesday said that once the electoral process begins with the announcement of dates, advertisements by political parties in newspapers not bearing name of the agency or issuing authority would invite trouble.

Responding to questions about the BJPâ€™s complaint against the Congress for issuing advertisements sans the source, EC spokesperson A N Jha said under the law, action could be taken against the party.

Though Jha said he was not aware of the complaint, he clarified that the Representative of Peopleâ€™s Act is clear. In the case of pamphlets by parties, the name of the publisher and printer and the number of copies have to be notified while in the case of newspaper advertisements, the agency or issuing authority has to be mentioned. â€˜â€˜Action can be taken but only when the election process begins,â€™â€™ he said.

Jha said the EC is talking to the income tax department so that information about the assets and liabilities furnished by a candidate in his affidavit could be shared. Talks are taking place at various levels and data sharing could begin from this election.

Jha said though all sitting MPs have been asked to clear their dues (phone, electricity) before filing their nomination papers, failure to do so would not invite disqualification. â€˜â€˜A candidate could be charged under law for giving a false affidavit, but cannot be disqualified.â€™â€™

The EC spokesperson said the commission would meet officials of the I&B ministry soon to finalise the time to be given to various political parties on private TV channels.

As to the ECâ€™s promise of helping parties in kind, Jha said it has started giving one copy of the electoral roll of a constituency to each candidate of a recognised party. Earlier, only two copies of the votersâ€™ list was given to the party. As for the demand of parties that votersâ€™ slip should be printed at state cost, Jha said the logistics have not been worked out yet.
