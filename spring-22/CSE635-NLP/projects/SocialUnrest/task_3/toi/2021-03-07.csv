0,Bihar minister escapes attack by criminals,"PATNA: Bihar Energy Minister Shakeel Ahmad Khan narrowly escaped with minor injuries when unidentified criminals in a jeep repeatedly dashed against his car near Nadaul in rural Patna, about 45 km from the district headquarters, the police said Saturday.

The car of the minister who was driving back to the state capital from Jehanabad was hit twice by the criminals in the jeep near Nadual on the Gaya-Patna Road late last night, the sources said.

The jeep of the criminals first smashed into the car from the left, then on the right, the side the minister was sitting on.

Shakeel Ahmad''s driver, in spite of being nudged by the jeep, skillfully kept the car on the road and sped on without stopping.

The criminals in the jeep later fled the scene.

The minister received a minor injury in the shoulder while his car was damaged, the sources said.

Shakeel Ahmad''s personal assistant filed a FIR with the Masaurhi police station.

The sources could not confirm whether the attack was targeted on the life of the minister or a mere attempt to loot him.

The police were investigating the case.

When contacted, the minister confirmed the incident and said he had suffered minor shoulder injury, but was unable to identify his attackers or state their motive.

1,LS polls: Many senior Congmen to keep away,"NEW DELHI: Age may have caught up with many senior Congressmen and they may go out of the election arena even though party chief Sonia Gandhi has said she was keen on seeing them in the poll fray.

The names of K Natwar Singh and Naval Kishore Sharma did not figure in the list of Rajasthan candidates that was taken up by the central election panel of the party, sources said.

In keeping with the trend in the party, many opting out may succeed in passing the seats on to their family members or protege.

Thus, Kerala veteran K Karunakaran, now above 80, is believed to be canvassing for passing the seat on to his daughter Padmaja.

This would also ''balance'' the equations within the family since there is a rivalry between Padmaja and brother K Muralidharan, member of 13th Lok Sabha who took over as a minister in the Antony government in Kerala.

Orissa''s former CM Giridhar Gomango is expected to contest for the assembly, leaving the Koraput LS seat to his wife.

Gujarat''s former CM Madhavsinh Solanki is al-so expected to opt out. The party may consider nominating his son Bharat.

2,UP police bolsters security for polls,"LUCKNOW: The decision of the UP police top brass to go for thorough anti-sabotage checks of polling booths and centres to weed out possibilities of use of explosives by anti-socials aiming to thwart the election process is expected to yield positive results.

Around 160 companies of central paramilitary forces (CPMF), 100 companies of PAC along with estimated one lakh forest guards, village chowkidars and home guards, besides 1.9 lakh officers and jawans of UPP would form the human security cover for each of the three phases of elections.

Giving details of the security preparation already underway by the UP Police, additional director general (ADG) law and order (LO) Buwa Singh told Times News Network that the strategy to check movement of anti-social elements by conducting elections in two adjoining districts on the same day would prove fruitful as unwanted elements would stay engaged in one place only and would not get the opportunity to travel down to adjacent constituencies after polling is completed in their domain. The decision to conduct elections on state borders could also bring promising results, he said.

Stressing on the need to identify and deal with issues related to caste, religion and political leanings, the ADG said that this would eliminate possibilities of last minutes clashes under a highly charged pre-election atmosphere where even petty issues assumed threatening proportions.

Having personally visited all the seven police zonal headquarters during his pre-election ground work, the ADG has directed his subordinates to identify sensitive and hypersensitive polling booths, centres and localities. These areas should be visited by an officer to verify first-hand that there was no issue pending between two sections which could serve certain sections planning to disrupt the election process, he said.

The first phase of elections would cover 32 parliamentary constituencies in 23 districts, while in the second phase, 30 constituencies spreading over 25 districts would be covered. The third phase would comprise 18 constituencies in 13 districts, ADG (LO) said. He emphasised that preventive arrests, getting suspected elements bound down before courts, taking into custody licenced arms from those who may take part in disruptive activities are the other aspects which would attract the attention of security agencies under precautionary measures to be taken prior to elections, he added.

3,Withdraw farmhouse proposal: BJP leader,"NEW DELHI: Criticising the proposal to levy charges for commercial use of farmhouses, BJP leader in the MCD Vijender Gupta said that the order should be withdrawn as it was ""unconstitutional and against the provisions of the act.""

Gupta has written to Delhi urban development minister Dr A K Walia demanding that the proposal be withdrawn.

The proposal to charge a fee of Rs 40,000 was cleared by the urban development ministry so that selective farmhouses could host such events which were going on in blatant violation.

The proposal is yet to be cleared by MCD standing committee.

""Any misuse charges that are levied by the MCD has to be cleared in the budget proposal. Provision has to be the made under the budgetary allocation. This is completely unlawful,"" Gupta said.

According to Gupta, under section 347 of the Delhi Municipal Act land use cannot be changed without the explicit written permission of the MCD commissioner.

He said that commercialisation of farm houses is an attempt to change land use that is not even under MCD''s area of concern.

""By allowing people to host events at farmhouses the government is covertly trying to change land use. How can Delhi government make changes in the Master Plan?"" Gupta asked.

He said the terms and conditions will open new vistas for corruption. ""It is wrong to charge one amount for different kind of functions. Every kind of social function cannot be measured with the same yardstick,"" he added.

There are few places for people to throw parties. MCD had planned use of farmhouses as a temporary arrangement till community halls and baraat ghars are prepared.

4,Holi overshadowed by looming elections,"LUCKNOW: Holi festivities have been overshadowed by election fever in the case of most of the political parties in Uttar Pradesh.

Resultantly, almost all party headquarters wore a deserted look on Saturday, barring that of the BJP, where party bigwigs assembled to deliberate on the list of possible candidates for the Lok Sabha elections in various constituencies in the state.

Cars sporting red beacons and accompanied by Black Cat commandos were parked in and outside the party office as leaders busied themselves with ''indoor'' meetings. The impatient second-rung leadership stood outside the office, speculating about the list of tickets amidst cups of tea accompanied by chewing tobacco. Everybody seemed least interested in the Holi celebrations. ""The list will decide whether or not Holi is happy or bad for us,"" quipped a supporter of an aspirant of a BJP ticket from Jhansi.

The state headquarters of the Samajwadi Party on Vikramaditya Marg was being decorated for the Holi festivities. Labourers were busy cleaning posters from the walls and road-rollers were levelling the freshly-laid concrete on the road, but no big leader was around. The huge gates of the BSP headquarters on Mal Avenue remained locked with a couple of people â€” predictably guards and the caretakers â€” soaking in the sun on the sprawling lawns.

A lone Siraz Mehndi sat at the media centre of the UP Congress Committee office on Mal Avenue along with a party spokesman, issuing press notes in the name of state congress president Jagdambika Pal, wishing everyone a happy and prosperous Holi. With no leaders or workers around, even the roadside tea stalls had closed down and the lone vendor that was spotted, was selling Holi colours.

5,Vajpayee gives political tinge to Holi,"NEW DELHI: Giving a political tinge to Holi, the festival of colours, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee on Sunday exuded confidence that people would vote his government back to power and that the forthcoming Lok Sabha polls should be fought on issues and in a peaceful manner.

""Elections should be fought peacefully and on issues. Polls give an opportunity to people to bring in a change but the change should be only for such a government that can fulfil their wishes and aspirations,"" he said at a ""Holi Milan"" celeberation programme at his residence.

The Prime Minister said his government had been ""trying for the last five years to fulfil the wishes of the people and in future we hope that people''s mandate will be in our favour.""

Vajpayee asserted the country is full of wealth and foodgrains and pointed out the new crop is ready.

""There is a need that everyone plays Holi forgetting differences and making a new beginning,"" he said, calling the youth to come forward and make India a strong and prosperous nation.

""The country is standing on a turn, where the entire world is looking towards us with great hope. We have to fulfil it... A new beginning has to be made where there will be no discrimination.... peace should prevail in the entire country and there should be no unrest. Holi is played with colours and not with blood,"" the Prime Minister said.

He said youth should understand their responsibilities and work towards a ""change"" in the country and take it to new heights in the field of development.

Vajpayee said the festival symbolises victory of good over evil and people should forget differences and play Holi.

Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani was among the first to greet Vajpayee on the occasion. Advani drove to the Prime Minster''s residence early in the morning and had breakfast with him.

Among other VIPs to greet the Prime Minister were Union Ministers Murli Manohar Joshi, Shatrughan Sinha, Saheb Singh Verma, Vijay Goel and cricketer-turned-politician Mohinder Amarnath.

Sitting under the colourful ""shamiyana"" (tent), Vajpayee was greeted with ""gulal"" and petals by a stream of visitors and physically handicapped, school children.

Vajpayee''s foster daughter Namita played a perfect host and looked after the guests, especially journalists, who had gathered at the Prime Minister''s residence, well.

Holi songs from Bollywood movies added colour to the festival as children danced with mirth on the lawns of the Prime Minister''s residence.
