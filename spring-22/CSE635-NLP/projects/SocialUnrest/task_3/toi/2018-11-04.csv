0,‘Pursue policy of hot pursuit’,"amritsar:a day after prime minister atal behari vajpayee ruled out any indian aggression against pakistan, bhartiya janata party (bjp), on saturday, asked the government to pursue the policy of hot pursuit if the situation demands. india has rightly chosen for the present not to go in for hot pursuit as it has full confidence in itself to succeed by its present pro-active policy. but if the situation demands, circumstances compel and national interest needs, nothing should come in the way of the country in going all out to eliminate terrorism from both inside and outside the country, the party said in a resolution on terrorism passed at its two-day national executive meeting which concluded here. the bjp urged the government to take suitable steps for early adoption of united nation convention on terrorism which india and several other countries had proposed two years ago.

1,Mushrooms farming a good option: Expert,"nabha (patiala): agriculture experts once again stressed the need to change the wheat-paddy crop rotation in punjab, at a kisan mela organised here, on saturday. senior entomologist dr joginder singh said that due to the present cropping pattern, ground water levels were decreasing nine inches every year, fertility was low and burning of paddy straw was polluting the environment. paddy had also affected the social structure of punjab.the migrant labour, brought in for paddy plantation, had increased population pressure and crime in the state, he observed. agriculture experts should make efforts to increase the yield of cotton, maize, pulses, oil seeds, soya bean and basmati, while the government should announce support prices for these crops, he stressed, adding that basmati, which needs less water, should be encouraged in gurdaspur, amritsar and ferozepur districts. another expert, dr rajpal futela from punjab agricultural university, said environment conditions in punjab were good for mushroom cultivation. just 400 farmers in the state were contributing to 25 per cent of the 50,000 tonnes of mushroom produced in the country. renowned scientist dr ranyodhan singh sahota said there was a lot of scope for milk production and farmers should set up dairies to increase their income. dr satpal mehra suggested the farmers should produce non-traditional cash crops like baby corns that had a good market for pickles, pakoras and soups etc.he said the crop took only 60 days to mature and for pop corns, pearl popwas was a good variety.

2,Akali Dal accused of sordid politics,"chandigarh: the role of the akali leaders came under fire, on saturday, when sikh intellectuals blamed them for ''reducing politics to a sordid game of self-interest, expediency, internal strife, corruption and mindless opportunism,'' causing serious damage to the sikh institutions. the sikh scholars were speaking at a seminar on sikh institutional failure, organised by the institute of sikh studies, here on saturday. they suggested that a an apex body be constituted to address the current problems of sikhs. in his keynote address, prominent sikh scholar dr gurdarshan singh dhillon said the akali dal, which had won universal acclaim during the gurdwara reform movement, was now ridden with ''nepotism, corruption and factional loyalties''. consequently, it had failed to safeguard the interests of the sikh panth. making a scathing attack on chief minister parkash singh badal, dhillon remarked under his ''hegemonistic leadership'', the akali dal had become a decadent and undemocratic organisation. ''autocratic and unscrupulous, badal is pursuing policies and strategies to promote his kith and kin, which is a disturbing phenomenon that requires serious introspection,'' noted dhillon. he wondered how could veteran akali leader harchand singh longowal, sign a pact with former prime minister rajiv gandhi and compromise on the ''horrendous attack on the golden temple and massive anti-sikh violence in delhi in 1984''. the akali leaders, he said, had been playing second fiddle to the centre overlooking interests of the sikhs, as has also been testified by the akali-bjp alliance under badal. decadent akali politics has had its bearing on religious sikh institutions as well. wresting control over the sgpc and the akal takht, badal had undermined their authority, he contended. another noted scholar dr jagjit singh stressed the need for depoliticising the shiromani gurdwara parbandhak committee and the akal takht. he regretted that sgpc members and akal takht jathedars pursued political goals at the cost of upholding religious values. he suggested that akal takht jathedars, instead of being the sgpc appointee, be selected by an electoral college, comprising prominent sikhs from all walks of life. maj gen (retd) jaswant singh, in his address, mooted the akal takht jathedar to be an autonomous body, shorn of sgpc control. the jathedar should not be an employee of the sgpc. noted sikh scholar dr kharak singh stressed to form an apex body which could address the problems being confronted by the sikhs at present. he said confusion over political goals, apostasy, challenge to their identity, were among the major problems being faced by sikhs. while the existing institutions like the sgpc, the akal takht, the chief khalsa diwan and others could carry on performing their task, an apex sikh institution should be formed to coordinate and cooperate, their activities.the apex body could, subsequently, acquire the status of the guru panth, he said.

4,Unlawful activities near Law College,"patna: even as the overcrowded patna university campus has been clamouring for space to meet the ever-increasing demand of its various colleges and departments, a vast portion of the university land, stretching from the bihar college of engineering to the patna law college, is under the illegal possession of some individuals for the last several decades. the entire land of the university located in the golakpur area has been grabbed by some local residents due to the reported indifference of the authorities concerned. the university had acquired about 60 acres of land at golakpur by the side of the ganga in 1955 after paying adequate compensation to the old residents of the area. the land had been acquired by the university for developing its campus in continuity from the engineering college to the law college. but the dream is unfulfilled . the golakpur area is now a sprawling colony with more than a dozen pucca houses, about 300 kuchcha hutments, three temples, innumerable tea stalls, betel shops and khatals. about 5,000 people are residing in this complex without any legal sanction. the illegal hutments constructed in the area serve as hide-outs for criminals and anti-social elements. stolen goods have been recovered from this locality on several occasions and criminals have been rounded up frequently. teachers and students living in the university quarters and hostels located at rani ghat feel quite insecure while passing through the stretch after the sunset. of late, the area has also become the nerve centre of business with the mushroom growth of traders of ganga sand and other building materials. tractors full of sand and bamboos, etc., can be seen moving in the locality throughout the day, causing great inconvenience to the university people. the building of the patna university centre of water resources studies, located in this area, also stands defaced. the girls' hostel of bihar college of engineering had to be shifted from this locality to the college premises due to increasing nuisance by rowdy elements. more than a decade back, the patna university teachers' association had launched an agitation for eviction of unauthorised occupants from this locality and construction of teachers' quarters and students' hostels on this land. the university authorities approached the district administration to get the land freed from the clutches of illegal occupants, but the university could not trace out the papers relating to the acquisition of the land. the university is in search of space for the construction of buildings for vanijya mahavidyalaya, patna university press, academic staff college, etc. the golakpur area would prove an ideal locality for development of these campuses, maintains a senior teacher of pu residing at rani ghat. a couple of years back, a fresh exercise was undertaken by the authorities to acquire this valuable plot of land with the help of district administration, but not much ice has been cut so far. the problem of acquisition still remains unsolved.

5,Oppn gears up for anti-govt rallies,"ranchi: pressure appears to be building up on the babulal marandi government just prior to its first birthday with major opposition parties not only demanding the resignation of the chief minister but also planning to organise rallies to highlight the failures and incompetence of the government in the past 11 months. even as one of the allies in the nda government — the janata dal (u) in the state has already announced its vikalp rally on november 8, left parties in the state are also not lagging behind. while the cpi has called for a jharkhand bachao rally on november 7 the cpi-ml's rally has been fixed for november 8. the opposition in jharkhand, including the jharkhand mukti morcha which has been baying for the blood of the nda government here. has now an immediate cause for seeking the removal of the marandi government with the killing of 13 policemen in topchanchi in dhanbad district on wednesday. cpi mla bhuneswar mehta, while describing the chief minister's statement that the morale of the police is still high as a big joke, demanded his resignation saying the marandi has no moral right to continue on his post. the incident only goes to prove that the police in jharkhand has virtually surrendered before the extremists, said mehta. he said the marandi government has little cause to celebrate its one-year rule. since the creation of jharkhand, the state has been going through a miserable phase with police firings on innocents, communal tensions and corruption on the rise. the cpi-ml mla mahendra prasad singh, on friday described the babulal marandi government as shameless and inefficient. marandi has forgotten his announcement he made following a clash between the villagers and the mcc on october 16, 2000, near teesri. he had asked the villagers to remain awake till november 15, 2000, as the then government was not capable of protecting them. after that, he would be awake to guard them from extremists, marandi had said then. but now an armed police picket is looted and policemen are killed, making marandi's claim hollow, singh said. singh urged people as well as the opposition leaders to throw out the marandi government. to mobilise people, the cpi(ml) has planned a vishwaashghaat virodhi week from november 8 and a sankalp rally, which will start from ramgarh, mandar and bundu on november 14 and terminate at ranchi in a rally on november 15.

6,Cultural diplomacy wins over politics,"mumbai: ``she melds virtuosity and devotion..bringing profundity to the music along with flamboyance,'' was what the new york times recently wrote about this pakistani prima donna. as far as the immensely gifted singer's fans are concerned, however, this is an understatement. abida parveen needs no introduction to connoisseurs who respect her as an artiste__the true, moving force in the realm of sufi music - who proclaims her faith with her entire body. when she sings, a trance-like state engulfs her as she raises her hands and exults in god. the undisputed queen of sufi music, her mystic singing spreads the message of love and induces a state of spiritual ecstasy among her listeners. long considered one of the most prominent exponents of the great ghazal and kafi musical styles of geet, and the sindhi, seraiki and punjabi musical flavours from the indian subcontinent, abida parveen's exotic melodies are rooted in intense encounters between sensitivity and spirituality. in fact, her earliest memories are linked to her passion for music and her desire to sing. born in 1954 in larkana, sindh, into a family which had close association with the shrines of sufi saints, abida parveen was initially trained by her father, ustad ghulam haider, and later by ustad salamat ali khan of the sham chorasia gharana. the rest, as they say, is history. the sunday times of india spoke to her in lahore by telephone and discussed a number of issues__from the role of indo-pakistani cultural events in bringing the two nations together to her latest musical trysts with the divine. excerpts from the conversation: many consider you an appropriate successor to ustad nusrat fateh ali khan. would you like to comment? nusratsa'ab was a qawwali master. frankly speaking, i pale in comparison to him. but if people still compare me with him, then it's my good luck. i learnt a lot from him when he was alive, and i think it was mutual. music critics say that unlike ustad nusrat fateh ali khan, who broke into the world music scene by collaborating with international artistes like michael brook or peter gabriel, you have yet to get into the joint-collaboration genre. is this a deliberate decision? see, i don't have a burning desire to be famous. if fame comes by the way, i'm happy. if not, i'm still happy. but yes, i'm now ready for experimentation on the world music scene. let's see what happens. you've performed all over the world. how similar are audiences in different countries? the audience is right there inside you. you have to convince yourself first and make yourself the first listener. for me, when i perform in front of an audience__be it in india, pakistan, the u.s., the uk, or elsewhere__i feel like i'm singing to god. for me, the audience is god. do you think cultural ambassadors like you can bring india and pakistan together? sound transcends all man-made boundaries. cultural ambassadors have managed to achieve where politicians and diplomats have failed. that has happened in the past, is happening now and will continue to happen in the future. sufi music has the potential to reach every nook and corner of india and pakistan and unite their audiences as one. your absolute command over the kafi of pakistani sufi poets like hazrat shah abdul latif bhittai, hazrat lal shahbaz qalandar, hazrat sacchal sarmast, hazrat khawja farid ganje shakar and hazrat mian muhammad buksh is well-known. do you also take up poetic works from other countries - like india, for instance? apart from the sufis of pakistan, i also sing mystic poetry from other asian countries, including india and turkey. hazra amir khusrau, hazrat nizamudin auliya, hazrat kutbuddin bakhtiar kaki, hazrat moinuddin chishti, hazrat moulana jalaluddin roomi..in fact, none of them are from pakistan. sufi songs have a distinct flavour of their own, but have still to become popular in mainstream areas like film music. why do you think that is? film music is temporary and situational. you tend to hear and then forget it after a while. but sufi songs are eternal since they have that element of spirituality which film-based ones don't have. moreover, sufi songs treat all humans as equal. what about plagiarism? a lot of hindi film songs lift sufi tunes in toto and then ride the charts. doesn't that bother you? plagiarism is good for sufi music. sufi tunes originated from the dargahs and the music of the dargahs is meant for everybody. so, if a music director lifts a sufi tune, doesn't that show the popularity of the tune itself? good tunes should be repeated as often as possible and should also reach out to the maximum number of people. and film music provides a way to reach the masses. what projects are you working on at the moment? i've recently done two albums - jahan-e-khusrau, a jugalbandi with tunisian singer lotfi bouchnak, and a solo called baba bulleh shah. baba bulleh shah was a mystic poet and intellectual whose teachings are still admired and followed all over punjab. then there are two more in the pipeline - a collection of rare ghazals from faiz ahmed faiz and sufi kalaams by baba shah hazrat hussein.

9,PIL for direction to govt on bio-terror threats,"new delhi: in the face of bio-terrorism threats, especially the anthrax scare, the delhi high court has been requested in a public interest litigation (pil) to issue direction to the centre and law-enforcing agencies, including the delhi police, to take protective measures against any such danger. the pil filed last week said in the wake of several incidents of anthrax scare and reports of bio-terror threats, the government and law enforcing agencies should be asked to take steps to monitor and detect such incidents including any hoax call made to spread panic among people. alleging that the union government and its law enforcing agencies had done precious little to take protective measures against bio-terrorism threats, particularly in big cities like delhi which were more vulnerable to such possible attacks, the petition said the danger could be real as india has been fighting cross-border terrorism for about two decades. the petition, filed as part of a pending matter related to ""deterioration"" of law and order in the national capital, is likely to be taken up for hearing by the court next week. claiming that the delhi police and other law enforcing agencies had virtually no arrangements, including modern equipment to combat bio-terror threats, especially to test the anthrax bacilli laced mails, the petition filed by an advocate pleaded the court to issue direction to the government to make these facilites available to them as a top priority.

12,Karunakaran flays Antony over arrest,"kochi: senior congress leader k karunakaran on saturday criticised the police action of arresting kozhikode district congress committee president m veerankutty in the early hours on november 1. police had violated the supreme court directions that are to be followed in all cases of detention while making the arrest, he told reporters here. the police action at kozhikode should be examined, mistakes corrected and it should not be repeated in future, he said. on the reported comment of chief minister a k antony that ""the kpcc president has to control partymen,"" he said though the kpcc president had not reacted, he should have replied that since the chief minister was holding the home ministry portfolio he should control the police. lashing out at the way the arrest was effected, he said the dcc president was not a criminal or a smuggler. the chief minister should find out the reason why the arrest was made in the early hours, he said. on antony's comment that law will take its own course, he said many others too had made such statements, but no action was taken against those responsible. karunakaran said since the dig had taken the whole responsibility for the arrest, there was no need of any inquiry. to run away from the issue by putting the blame on some innocent policemen was not correct, he said.

14,Govt to bring new hydro power policy: Prabhu,"dehradun: the government will soon come out with a national hydro power policy effecting fresh guidelines on ecological and societal aspects, minister for power suresh p prabhu said on sunday. ""in two months time, the government will come out with guidelines through national hydro power policy, detaling the ecological and societal issues to be addressed while coming up with hydro power projects,"" prabhu told reporters on the sidelines of a seminar, organised by the tehri hydro development corporation here on sunday. this move comes in a bid to remove hurdles faced by the sector and also set up a power fund for power generation by tapping the foreign and domestic debt markets. prabhu expressed the hope that the new policy would come by december or not later than january next year as he said: ""we also have to ensure ecological security, apart from energy security."" prabhu said the exploiting the potential of hydro power had become imperative considering the high cost involved in other modes of power as naptha and cng. he, however, did not disclose the nitty-gritty of the proposed guidelines, but said it would not be a ""stand-alone"" policy but encompassing the broad contours ecological, societal issues concerned. the minister also said the government has proposed to set up a new power fund, the corpus of which could run into billion dollars by tapping the foreign and domestic markets, especially debt funds for the power generation in the country. there would also be the participation of the power generating companies, he said inaugurating the accelerated power development fund project for the maintenance and distribution of power projects. government had in february last year approved the apdp for upgradation of sub-trasmission and distribution systems including energy accounting and metering in addition to renovation and modernisation of low power plants both hydro and thermal. however, on the hydropower generation, prabhu said it had to come solely from the state government's initiatives and the central government would only be a facilitator and give assistance. he also said the centre would invest in improving the distribution system to reduce the transmission and distribution loss. ""at present, we have it in 60 cities. i will shortly go to the cabinet with a proposal for extending it to across the country,"" prabhu said. on the issues, including the rehabilitation of people affected by thdc project, he asked the uttaranchal chief minister bhagat singh koshiari to set up a committee of 2-3 people so that the centre could also reciprocate with equal number of people, for a detailed and fruitful deliberations so as to commission the project well in time. the 2,400 mw project, estimated to cost rs 9,090 crore as per the revised estimate, is expected to be commissioned by december 2002 with the first phased expected to be in march, 2002. however, sources said the completion of first phase was likely to be delayed due to delay in tunnelling work.

17,Dalits under forced 'house arrest' in Rantila,"ahmedabad: ten days ago, chief minister narendra modi surprised patan collector m k das by asking him about a comparatively small issue - the displacement of 29 dalit families harassed by higher caste members at rantila village. promising immediate action, das has sent the families back to the village under srp protection. since then, they have remained under a state of house arrest. fearing a backlash, the dalits have not stepped out, preferring to confine themselves to their homes. on account of not being able to till their land, they have spent the last few days fighting hunger and have had to live on crumbs. activists working with them say this is not complete justice. the chief minister may use technology to force the administration into action, but how is he going to ensure that the oppressed will get back the rights they have been deprived of for ages, they ask. for them, it is more a matter of freely exercising their right over their own land without fear, rather than merely occupying it. ""i have spoken to the families and asked them to go back to their land,"" says dinesh parmar of the banaskantha dalit sanghathan, one of the voluntary bodies working with dalits in the region. parmar, who had attended the united nations meet against racism in south africa recently, says if the srp is providing protection, it is their responsibility to ensure that the dalits are not attacked. ""we are also planning further legal action if the families are attacked again."" patan's resident deputy collector and additional district magistrate m b patel believes their role is limited once a piece of land is handed over to a private organisation. ""all the same, we have removed the encroachments and provided the necessary protection,"" he says. ""we are even ready to keep the policemen there till tensions subside, and increase the number of personnel if the need arises."" sources at the collectorate, however, added that they were aware the srp cannot be a shield between the two communities forever. they are planning a conciliation meeting to find a more permanent solution. having formed a co-operative in 1984, this land has been the only form of livelihood of the dalit families. agriculture has remained the mainstay of the community in a region where there are negligible industry and employment opportunities. afraid that they would lose their only source of income, the dalits, led by leaders like hathibhai chauhan, started opposing the encroachments and registered police cases against attempts to take away the land. with rumours of an imminent attack by the higher caste members rife and little chance of help from the police, the families, including 33 men, 16 women and 12 children, camped outside the district collector's office till they were forced to go back. this form of protest against higher caste hindus, however, is rare in the banaskantha region where thousands of acres of land, given to dalits after the implementation of the land ceiling act, is still controlled by other communities. the behavioural science centre (bsc), another ngo working with dailts in banaskantha, conducted a survey in three villages at vav taluka and found that more than 200 acres of land were legally in the names of dalits, but were used by other communities. ""our estimate is that nearly 700 acres of land in vav taluka alone has not been given to dalits even if it belongs to them,"" says geeta oza of the bsc. ""with little help from the authorities, it is difficult to fight against such atrocities. the police, for instance, may register a case, but the fir will be extremely diluted and the investigating will have huge hole in it. as a result, no action is taken against the culprits.""

18,More teeth to eco laws urged,"lucknow: the three-day national symposium on the role of earth sciences in integrated development and related social issues concluded on sunday with a call to keep vested interests at bay while implementing hard decisions arising out of the social needs to protect the environment for posterity against the short-term gains. it also called for suitable amendments in the environment protection acts as also the creation of a comprehensive data bank on geoenvironmental and natural hazards for quick retrieval, dissemination and exchange of database. the symposium also called for a continuous generation and subsequent monitoring of geological data, careful evaluation of factors such as urbanisation, industrialisation, waste disposal and dwindling resources on fragile eco system, generation of various thematic maps suitable for sustainable land use planning, greater applicability of remote sensing using high resolution satellite and airborne data as also greater thrust to the preparation of regional and site-specific hazards and risk zonation maps for earthquakes and landslides. listing these recommendations which emerged out of the three-day recommendations, director-general, gsi, ravi shankar, said the symposium also called for a long-term perspective and planning for sustainable development and the considering of remedial measures in adapting and mitigating environmental degradation and hazards which have already set in. he said the gsi, over the years, had developed a vast repository of earth science database which was being used for environmental evaluation and management. its utilisation needs to be made mandatory. he also called for environmental auditing as developmental activities and its impact on environment was a dynamic process and function of a complex set of variables. union state minister for coal and mines, ravi shankar prasad, said the time had now come to ensure that projects which were likely to disturb the equilibrium of the eco system got the sanction of the gsi. the organization should also be vested with power to withhold the sanction for such projects and which should be honoured. he said with the introduction of a free market policy the gsi would be required to generate a comprehensive database and gear up studies related to geo environment, geo hazards and geo techniques. the minister said while exploitation of natural resources for sustenance could not be slowed down one could also not ignore the conservation of the environment. the gsi was best suited for maintaining the balance in view of exhaustive study of the earth over the years. he added the gsi should come up with comprehensive data, but one which was spoken in the contemporary language in the spheres of earthquake mapping, flood mapping, landslides and the rapid and reckless urbanisation. similar sentiments were echoed by saraswati pratap singh, minister for small industries, up government.

19,"Break one coconut, and all the rules","mumbai: there are times for comfort foods. when lovers leave, pets die, when countries go to war. when the morning headlines and coffee stick in our throats and we yearn for familiar flavours that reach into the depths of our palette's memories for the feel of security and predictability and confidence that someone who knows his/her stuff is taking care of all the important things. for most adults, comfort food is a familiar everyday food of their childhood, usually creamy and easy to swallow, hot rather than cold. we eat them in celebration too, but we need them most when things eat into our world, leaving gnawing gaps and jagged edges. for me comfort food is the goan fish curry. no exotica, no surprises, no excited anticipation, just the sure knowledge that this red creamy creation is going to taste like it always did when the sun rose in the morning and set in the evening, with no shocks in between. the secret of the perfect goan curry is in the rules. break all of them gently but purposefully, particularly the following cooking commandments. never mind that they came down the mountain with moses: * always add the souring agent at the end, or the dish will curdle. * always saute the onion for a viscous curry. * never, ever, cook any dish on a high flame once you've added the coconut milk, it will split. add thick coconut milk only at the end (you have to lock everyone else out while breaking this one). these rules apart, break one coconut, more dry than tender. grate. extract coconut milk. or (keep the purists locked out), use the one that comes out of a tetrapak. the search for the perfect goan curry is a lonely one. fraught with moments of bewilderment, self doubt and guilt-ridden compromise. it is a journey littered with the remains of would-be curry makers, ground into the dust by foodie talk of grinding stones, estuarine shrimp, authenticity..but every able bodied person should know how to make his or her own comfort food, whatever it takes, however long the pursuit. this particular recipe has come a long way. grandmothers, aunts, friends, the time-saving, energy conserving bits largely my own, motivated mostly by sloth. but these alone do not a goan curry make, what really makes this curry fly is the rule-breaking, the deliberateness and purposeful anarchy. and credit for all of that goes to bonita, the cook-cum-cleaning woman who materialises every time the old home is opened up in goa. in the most offhand, undramatic, slightly bored manner, bonita makes the best curries north or south of the zuari. first, she chops an onion, fine. then, half heartedly, she takes half a teaspoon of salt and with her hand mixes it well into the onion, pressing slightly to release a bit of the onion juice. why? i have no idea, maybe it's just a ritual my grandmother followed to soothe her frazzled nerves when st anthony ignored her prayers for rain, maybe she did it to make onion-salting monkeys of her progeny, but bonita does it too, and so we will. grind together a handful of red chillies, a smattering of jeera, a bit of haldi, tamarind and garlic. mix together everything you have so far. that is it. truly. now to break the big one. check that lock, take a deep breath and keep the dish on a merry flame. do not turn the flame down. if you've answered algebra tests, fallen off a bike, come this far to calm your troubled soul, you can do this. this is not a delicate gossamer kind of dish, it's a slapdash thing, full of nerve and verve. when the curry whips up a good bubbling froth, swirl it lightly, consign to flame until it bubbles again, swirl again. the third time it bubbles, add your fish (salt first). keep the curry going for as long as it takes to go through the bubble-swirl routine a few more times. close the dish, unlock the kitchen door, go for a brisk walk. the dish needs to keep for a bit, besides, burning off about 200 calories helps. particularly since this curry does not make for a blob-of-pate-and-posie-type meal. it is a rambunctious red creamy food which will rest assertively atop a mound of rice. the brave heart will have found its soul. the belly its fire. and for one long shining moment, order and comfort will reign.

24,Rajkot farmers sore over tags attached to support price,"rajkot: farmers of rajkot district have strongly opposed to the tags attached by the state government on the purchase of groundnut through the support price mechanism. the move is expected to boomerang into a farmers' agitation if steps are not taken to withdraw them. sources in the agriculture market said the government guidelines are so strict that adhering to them will affect the farmers financially. guidelines like cleaning of groundnut before bringing them to the market are unviable as around 1,000 to 1,500 bags arrive from various centres daily. besides this, farmers are required to produce the 'khedut pothi' issued to them in original to prove that he/she is a farmer. moreover, a clause says farmers would be issued bearer cheques payable 15 days after bringing their produce to the market yard. and there was no guarantee that payments would be made on time. the farmers demanded that they be paid in cash on the day their produce is brought to the yard. meanwhile, two government agencies -- gujcomasol and nafed -- on thursday started the purchase of groundnut through the support price fixed by the government from amreli and rajkot. farmers in saurashtra, considered the groundnut bowl of the country, harvested a bumper crop this year. however, due to the lack of any support price mechanism for their produce, they had to face huge financial losses. state agriculture minister purshottam rupala initiated the purchase process through auction and the price for each quintal of groundnut was fixed at rs 1,342.50. according to a rough estimate, the total output of groundnut in the state is around 21 lakh tonne of which gujcomasol has agreed to purchase one lakh tonne. rupala said the co-operative body also purchased bajra worth rs 3 crore under the support price mechanism. he said the state government has also sent a proposal to offer support price mechanism for maize and other agricultural produce.

27,‘Waterways a party in Ganga case’,"patna: the patna high court on friday gave a directive for making the inland waterways authority of india (iwai) a party in the public interest litigation (pil) which seeks cleaning of the ganga and steps to check the northward drift of the river away from the city. a division bench comprising justice s k singh and justice s k katriar passed the order for making the iwai a party due to its role in dredging the ganga bed near patna. before passing the order on the writ petition of the convener of the ganga bachao andolan, vikas chandra alias guddu baba, the court took judicial notice of the riverbed rising due to siltation and of the ganga water level along the city going down due to its northward drift. the court also gave a directive for making the patna regional development authority a party in the case due to its role in cleaning patna. the plea of guddu baba was that due to heavy siltation over the years in the riverbed the ganga has started changing its course. he referred to other factors that have given rise to the river drift. the court directed the patna municipal corporation (pmc) and other concerned agencies of the state government to take all steps to clean the river banks before chhath festival. the pmc and the state government have to submit reports to the court about cleaning of the river banks by wednesday. guddu baba showed to the court photographs of the animal carcasses dumped on the river bank polluting the environment. he had earlier shown photographs of the human bodies dumped behind the patna medical college hospital (pmch). despite court's directive, he said, the dumping of bodies on the river bank has not stopped. he argued that the river bank was to be maintained by the pmc but that is not being done. the secretary of the council for protection of public rights and welfare, m p gupta, a lawyer, submitted that due to the neglect of the pmc the banks of the river have become dirty and so unfit for chhath puja. as regards the cleaning of the pmch campus, a member of the three-lawyer committee had earlier reported to the court that there was an agreement between the pmch and the pmc that the latter would clean the pmch campus on payment. but on friday the pmc lawyer stated that there is no such agreement. the pmc lawyer contended that the pmch owes rs 55 lakh to the pmc by way of holding tax for the last several years. it's a sheer clash between two government agencies — pmc and pmch — over the cleaning of the latter's premises, quipped gupta.

28,4 killed in suicide attack on Army camp,"srinagar: a suicide squad of the pakistan-based lashkar-e-taiba (let) struck at an army camp, triggering a fierce encounter in which four soldiers and a militant were killed and five jawans injured in anantnag district of south kashmir, official sources said sunday. the attack comes a day after the united states designated the let and the jaish-e-mohammed (jem) as ""terrorist organisations"". a defence spokesman told times news network that three militants barged into a rashtriya rifles camp after hurling grenades. the militants, dressed in army fatigue, fired rpgs and grenades at the main gate of the camp at dayalgam, about 60 km from here, around 9 pm saturday and two of them managed to enter the camp. in the crossfire, which lasted over two hours, three jawans were killed and six injured. one of the jawans later succumbed to injuries, they said. immediately after the attack on the camp, troops launched a search operation but abandoned it later as the militants were in army uniform, they said. a militant, who had taken shelter inside a wooden structure, opened fire and lobbed grenades when troops moved in for a search operation sunday and was killed in retaliatory fire, the sources said. however, his other accomplice could not be traced, they said, adding it was suspected that only one militant had intruded into the camp while his accomplices provided fire cover to him from outside and slipped away. a search operation has been launched in the villages adjacent to the camp to trace the militants. confirming the attack, a defence spokesman said four jawans and a pakistani militant were killed. meanwhile, claiming responsibility, an let spokesman said three of its activists — abu hashim and abu muslim (both kashmiris) and abu umar (pakistani) — were involved in the attack. he claimed eight soldiers were killed in the attack, adding abu umar had returned to his hideout. elsewhere in the state, an exfiltration bid by militants was scuttled by the security forces and 29 people, including 23 militants and a jawan, were killed in stepped-up violence since saturday night. the exfiltration attempt by 15 militants, belonging to the harkat-ul-mujahideen, tehreek-e-jehadi islami and the hizbul mujahideen, was scuttled by the security forces in loren area of poonch district early sunday, when troops shot dead 10 militants and arrested five, the sources said. this is the second single major operation to foil an infiltration-exfiltration bid in three days. the sources said a jawan was killed in an encounter with militants in niram village in udhampur district saturday night. a civilian was also killed in the shootout. the militants fired at security forces at taranah nallah near dayalechok in kathua district and in the retaliatory action, one militant was killed. militants shot dead a timber smuggler, nazir ahmad bhat at khigam in pulwama district, while the body of an unidentified person was found in dedikote in kupwara district.

29,What is the govt's definition of nationalism?,"new delhi: union minister arun shourie, a crusader for human rights and natural rights, has triggered a debate on ""what is nationalism"" and ""who is a nationalist"". defending the prevention of terrorism ordinance, he recently sought to equate opposition to the ordinance as opposition against nationalism. the debate on nationalism may be endless and remain inconclusive. what is the government's definition of nationalism? has the government shown its keenness to encourage the spirit of nationalism among the citizens? the least it could have done in that regard was to abide by the supreme court's directive to amend the flag code suitably so as to lift the restrictions imposed on flying the national flag throughout the year by anyone. the union government had appealed to the supreme court five years ago with an unusual request that a young industrialist naveen jindal be restrained from flying the tricolour atop his business premises and home. the court did not concede to this request but asked the government to inform it why certain restrictions, though no enforceable under the penal law, should not be lifted. the government set up a committee which also felt that the citizens who wished to show respect to the national flag should not be prevented from doing so. it is a bizarre restriction, unheard of in any self-respecting democratic country across the globe. so much time has elapsed since the court's intervention, the government has been dilly dallying with the implementation of the expert committee report. before the vajpayee government came to power, such senior advocates as attorney general soli sorabjee, solicitor general harish n salve, union law minister arun jaitley , k k venugopal, former law minister shanti bhushan, and a m singhvi had argued for jindal in the apex court. later, except shanti bhushan, venugopal and singhvi, all became the part of the government. there cannot be any doubt that these senior lawyers would have changed their views on the need to make flag code citizens friendly. yet, a notification allowing the citizens to honour the national flag in order to demonstrate their nationalism and love for the country is elusive. during a chat session on the issue of national flag organised by indiatimes.com, a keen participant asked jindal: ""please what is the tentative date for us to be able to fly the national flag on our houses as well?"" another inspired by the american type of nationalism queried: ""will we be allowed to have the tricolour on our outfits"". lastly, a netizen felt: ""i think it is (ban on flying the national flag) is more to do with bureaucracy"". the founding fathers of the constitution did not envisage any restriction on flying the national flag. in countries such as usa, canada, australia and japan, the citizens are free to fly their respective national flags throughout the year. ironically, the indians can keep aloft any other country's flag but not their own.

30,Dalits forced to stay under 'house arrest',"ahmedabad: ten days ago, chief minister narendra modi surprised patan collector m k das by asking him about the displacement of 29 dalit families, allegedly harassed by upper caste members at rantila village. promising immediate action, das sent the families, camping outside his office, back to the village under srp protection. since then, they have remained virtually under a state of house arrest. fearing a backlash from the upper castes, the dalits have confined themselves to their homes. as a result, they have not been able to till their land and spent the past few days living on crumbs, fighting hunger. till they were forced to return, these families, including 33 men, 16 women and 12 children, had camped outside the district collector's office after fleeing their village as rumours were rife of an eminent attack by the higher caste members and that the local police would be of little help. the trouble started when a co-operative was set up in 1984 under which land was given to dalit families. agriculture is the mainstay of the community in this region. afraid that they would lose their only source of income, the dalits, led by leaders like hathibhai chauhan, started opposing the encroachments on their land and registered police cases against upper caste members' attempts to take away their land. this form of protest against higher caste hindus, however, is rare in the banaskantha region, where thousands of acres of land, given to dalits after the implementation of the land ceiling act, is still controlled by other communities. ngo activists working with dalits say sending them back is not complete justice. the cm may have forced the administration to act, but how is he going to ensure that the dalits can freely exercise their right over their land without fear rather than holding land in name only. the behavioural science centre (bsc), an ngo working with dalits in banaskantha, conducted a survey in three villages in vav taluka and found that over 200 acres of land were legally in the names of the dalits, but were used by other communities. ""our estimate is nearly 700 acres of land on vav taluka alone has not been given to dalits even if it belongs to them,"" says geeta oza of the bsc. ""with little help from the authorities, it is difficult to fight against such atrocities. the police, for instance, may register a case, but the fir will be extremely diluted and the investigating will have huge hole in it. as a result no action is taken against the culprits.""
