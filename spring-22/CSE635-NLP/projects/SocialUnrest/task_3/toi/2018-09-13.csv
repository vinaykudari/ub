0,"Sonia is Indian, rules SC","new delhi: the supreme court has ruled that congress president sonia gandhi is an indian citizen. it upheld her election to the lok sabha seat from amethi in 1999. ''it must be held that sonia gandhi by virtue of the certificate granted to her under section 5(1)(c) of the citizenship act, which has not been cancelled, withdrawn or annulled till date, is a citizen of india,'' a bench comprising chief justice a s anand, justice r c lahoti and justice doraiswamy raju said.dismissing two petitions challenging sonia's election on the ground that her indian citizenship was acquired in doubtful circumstances, the bench referred to the grant of citizenship to her on april 30, 1983, under section 5(1)(c) of the indian citizenship act on the ground of her having married a citizen of india. petitioners hari sanker jain and hari krishna lal had questioned sonia's citizenship nearly two decades after the grant of citizenship to her. the bench also criticised the petitioners for making vague allegations regarding her citizenship. it said, ''at no point of time did the petitioners even challenge the inclusion of her name in the electoral roll.'' the bench said: ''making vague and bald allegations, without giving any material facts, after losing the elections, goes to show that even proper care was not taken before filing the petitions by gathering and stating all material facts.'' the petitioners' challenge to the validity of her marriage to rajiv gandhi not only suffered from deficiency in pleadings but ''is also scandalous,'' the bench said. referring to the allegations regarding her allegiance to italy, the country of her birth, the court said, ''factual matrix for the bald assertion is completely missing from the election petition.'' ''there is no overt act relating to adherence and allegiance after the grant of citizenship to sonia gandhi, even alleged, let alone supported, through any material facts,'' the apex court added.

1,"No fire-fighting equipment, hospitals woefully short of beds","new delhi: plagued by politics and inaction, delhi government's disaster management committee has still not been able to come up with a contingency plan to cope with calamities. constituted under the chairmanship of urban development minister a k walia in early 1999, the panel was non-functional till the gujarat earthquake struck in january. the panel was revived when the seismological department dubbed delhi as earthquake-prone. the first job for the committee was to enforce the disaster management plan announced by lt governor vijai kapoor on january 29 following the gujarat earthquake. it called for opening disaster management centres at fire stations, importing equipment and activating medical services. till date, only one fire station — the one in nehru place — has been converted into a disaster management centre. fire service chief s k dheri said the proposal had not been implemented due to delay in procurement of equipment. ''the delhi metro rail corporation is procuring the equipment on our behalf. it is a bureaucratic process which will take its own time,'' he said. even as the government dreams of high-tech ways to cope with emergencies, the fire services do not possess even basic equipment to deal with low-intensity mishaps. so desperate is the situation that the department launched a frenzied search for cranes when a truck fell into the yamuna last month. finally, one had to be hired from a private contractor. the department also hires earth-moving equipment from private contractors for rs 2,500 to rs 5,000 a day. despite the fact that delhi falls in a seismic zone, fighting fire and floods are the only two functions for which the disaster management committee has prepared itself. there is no plan for coping with earthquakes. walia said the committee had suggested changes in building bylaws to make them earthquake-resistant. ''the matter is pending with the delhi development authority,'' he said. the committee's chief functions include providing tents and water, and distributing food and medicines to affected people. ''the committee owns 35 centralised accident trauma service ambulances. we are increasing the number of beds in the city's hospitals to 2,500. also, we have asked all hospitals to store medicines to last a year,'' walia said. delhi has only two specialised wards to treat burn cases. while safdarjung hospital's burns ward has 115 beds, lnjp hospital has 40. safdarjung hospital's burns ward has a high occupancy. ''we are full most of the time. only 10-15 beds remain empty in the most lean periods,'' said a doctor. so what do they do in terms of disaster preparedness? ''we generally ask each of the wards to empty 10 to 15 beds. this is done by discharging patients on the eve of august 15 and january 26.'' such an exercise leaves them with about 100 to 150 beds in the entire hospital to meet an emergency. says dr rajiv ahuja, who heads the burns and plastics ward at lnjp hospital: ''one cannot keep beds empty in the vague anticipation of a disaster. who will bear the cost of that?'' ahuja explains the disaster preparedness plans are kept for the entire hospital and is not wards. while the delhi government has a disaster management plan for its hospitals — albeit on paper — there is no such coordinated plan surrounding the central government hospitals in the city. ''what these hospitals can do at best, is the post disaster fire-fighting,'' said a medical superintendent of one of the central government hospitals. says dr ashish rohatgi, a resident doctor at sucheta kriplani hospital: ''there are just eight beds in the disaster ward...culled from the emergency ward itself.'' the blood banks, even the biggest one run by the indian red cross society, do not store blood. says red cross society's deputy secretary s c goel: ''whenever a disaster occurs, we appeal to the citizens who donate blood.''

3,MSU elections: Leaders offer to do odd-jobs,"vadodara: getting one's identity card renewed, filling out exam forms, or getting a library card made, one would assume that these were mundane odd-jobs. but think again. in the maharaja sayajirao university here the election manifestos of most student leaders includes promises to get all these jobs done without the hassle of standing in long queues. ""vote for us, we will help you get all work done at the administrative office"" is a commonly heard refrain on campus. not just that, student leaders in fact have already started doing such jobs for students to win their favour. ""we have a better rapport with the administrative staff here. if a student goes to get his id card or library card done it would take him longer. but a student leader wields power and the staff members know that they have to work quick to avoid trouble. so we help students,"" says a candidate who is standing for the past of 'faculty representative' at the faculty of commerce. ""if i can get my work done quicker by delegating it to student leaders, then why not. but the problem is that once elections are over they are hardly seen and if there is a genuine problem its difficult to track them,"" says anjali m, a second year student. however, many student leaders say that they have also taken up several serious issues in the past. bharat dangar former students' union general secretary says it was only after they intervened that the university authorities took up the work of repairing roads on the campus. ""we had also organised agitation to fight for student's rights, on many occasions,"" he said. some students, however, hold a different opinion. ""if disrupting classes through blaring noise, quarrels and slogans is 'helping' the student, then we prefer not to have any of it,"" says sanjay dave an sybcom student. according to him most student leaders do not have much to promise, as they are a reflection of the politicians in the outside world. ""but sometimes student leaders do help us in getting work done quicker as the university administrative staff are more alert to the needs of the student leaders. this again is a reflection of the outside world where people have to go through councillors to get basic civic amenities from the authorities,"" he says. truly the university is a grand training ground for future politicians.

15,Tiger expert charged with violating rules,"jaipur: ranthambhor's tiger expert, fateh singh rathore faces a strange predicament once again. this time, it is not due to his report about a missing tiger or the number of wild cats in ranthambhor. but it is due to his safaris in this park. a world renowned tiger expert rathore was in the jeep that took former us president bill clinton around the ranthambhor forest when he visited india and served as his guide. he served as the director of the tiger sanctuary and after his retirement from the indian forest service, he was given the role of an honorary warden by the state government so as to contribute towards tiger conservation. in this capacity, he visited the park daily. but he invariably carried with him some friends, mostly foreigners, on such safaris. the forest department has issued a notice to rathore for the recovery of rs 65,000, the amount relating to the entry fee, jeep fee and other expenses incurred during the park visits. the rules permit an honorary warden to enter the park without paying entry fee but not to his friends. a forest department source informed that rathore has not cared to acknowledge the notice issued to him a month ago. if he does not clear his dues, the department shall initiate legal action as per the rules, the source said. it has been reported that rathore has been wielding pressure on local forest officials on issues related with the park management. inspired by him, several other honorary wardens in rajasthan are also undermining government rules to have personal safaris in national parks. a few even intimidate the park authorities. rathore has been recruited by a big hotel group to organise its jeep safaris in the park. the new hotel of the chain is to be launched soon and it is alleged to be constructed over rathore's land who is believed to have received a hefty amount in the deal. efforts to get the version of rathore was made but he was not available.

16,MCC by-polls: It's a triangular contest,"mangalore: it's election time again. though it is for the corporators post in the 47th valencia ward of the mangalore city corporation, it has all the trappings of a general election. this by-election is being conducted for the corporator's post, which fell vacant due to the untimely demise of corporation's former mayor s. sundari recently. the post is reserved for backward women candidates. with elections on sunday (september 16), the environment is hotting up with a triangular contest in the offing, between three women candidates from as many political parties. they are vijayalaxmi of congress, vasanthi anand of bjp and parvathi of bhaujan samaj party (bsp). interestingly, this is the third time since 1997, by-elections are being held in the corporation (earlier at falnir and katipalla wards), all necessitated due to demise of the elected corporators. though the selection of candidates was smooth in bjp and bsp camp, it, as usual, led to fisticuffs in the congress camp. on september 3, women congress partyworkers from janardhan poojary camp physically prevented to stop veerappa moily's candidates from filing her nomination for the by-election of valencia ward. early on that day, appi latha, from poojary camp, filed her nomination papers and about 60 of her supporters waited in front of the election officer's chamber to prevent somebody else filing nomination from the congress party. when vijayalakshmi (the official candidate now) came to file her nomination in the afternoon, she was pulled around by the poojary group women. only the intervention of the police made vijayalaxmi file her papers. coming to the valencia ward polls, this seat has been the stronghold of the congress from the past three terms (15 years), and the last time congress won it through sundari in 1997. in the jeppu-valencia ward, the woman electorate outnumber men by atleast 10 per cent. of the 3,227 voters, women constitute 1,771 and men are 1,456. the ward includes jeppu-valencia, sooterpete, kudkori gudde in kankanady and a small portion of gorigudde. while congress candidate vijayalxmi is the relative of former mayor sundari, both the bjp and bsp candidates have been in the known well due to their social service activities. all candidates argue that they would fight elections to provide better amenities to their ward people. though the winning/losing of the seat won't make any difference to the majority of the congress in the corporation, they have taken it as a prestige issue. the congress has 34 members in the 59 member council, with bjp a far second with 22, dal (2) and cpi having a lone member. but, the bjp is determined to give congress a tough fight. their confidence stems from the fact that the ward people are disgruntled with poor roads and drinking water supply, which has not improved even after their earlier corporator became a mayor. according to corporation sources, the ward has christians in majority followed by sc/sts. this fact is reflected from the fact that till now people in the ward have voted based on party affiliations (i.e.; congress). it will be interesting to see whether they deviate from this line, to provide an unlikely winner.
