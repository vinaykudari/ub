1,Fringe elements add colour to poll party,"NEW DELHI: Want a good laugh? Just hang around the party offices here for a day. Babulal Sonkar is 80 years old, can barely walk, and is hard of hearing.

From rural UP, he cannot understand queries even in simple Hindi. But he is in Delhi, camping in front of the AICC office to get a Lok Sabha ticket from Ghatampur in UP.

Raj Goel is in her late 20s. At times she says she''s from Indore, sometimes from Rohini, but she''s waiting to get a ticket from ""anywhere"". She marks her presence everyday in the BJP office. Meet the oddball candidates of Election 2004.

There are many like Sonkar and Raj who reach party offices from all corners of the country looking for tickets to contest elections. Never mind that their chances of making it are remote, to say the least.

M S Patel, 55, wants a BJP ticket from Rajgarh. He is at the party office almost everyday and signs the visitors''s register as: ""A Surprise"", managing director, Patel World Surprise Super Tea.

""Whether he gets a ticket is another matter, but at least he entertains us everyday,"" said a BJP party worker.

Then there are the fringe elements who hang around just to entertain onlookers or attract the attention of leaders and the media. Rajeev Lochan Pandey has come from Kanpur.

He is camping in front of the Congress office. He wants party membership, and that, too, straight from Sonia Gandhi''s own hands.

He has designed his own ""rath"" for the Congress and carries a small coffin on his head which has a list of Ghotalas (scams) pasted on it. Besides, he wants to give Mrs Gandhi four poll posters and more than dozen slogans.

His slogan: ""Hum to mange na ticket, humse kaam lo wikat"" (I don''t want ticket, you can give me tough work).

Gaya Ram has pedalled all the way on a bicycle from Amethi. His cycle has a big poster of Sonia covered with a dupatta, shlokas, letters, slogans and surrounded by Congress flags.

Whether it is a well-planned move to get into news, or something else, one thing these ''hangers'' certainly do provide: colour to the elections.

2,"'SP a regional party, BSP a nuisance factor'","LUCKNOW: More people die today in UP than in a terrorist-infested state like Jammu and Kashmir and the law and order situation is going from bad to worse with each passing day.

This was stated by senior BJP leader, Om Prakash Singh, while denouncing the Mulayam Singh Yadav-led government in the state.

Talking to reporters here on Saturday, Singh said that people should not get confused by tall claims made by Samajwadi Party, adding that it was no more than a regional party, whose sole objective was to secure a bargaining position in the next government to be formed in Delhi after the forthcoming Lok Sabha polls.

So was the case of BSP, which he described as a ''nuisance factor,'' harping on the sentiments of Dalits and exploiting them in its interest.

But, then he chose to defend the government formed by the BJP with its support thrice in the state, saying that it was a merely an experiment done under most compelling political circumstances in the larger interest of the state.

The forthcoming Lok Sabha elections, he said, was essentially between the BJP-led NDA alliance and the Congress-led coalition. And people, he said should use their voting rights judiciously to keep regional parties out of reckoning, as their only purpose was to create instability.

Driven by the conflict model, regional parties by way of securing some Lok Sabha seats wanted lion''s share in the government formation by the major political party, he said.

Such a trend, he said, was not a healthy sign for democracy and the only way to check it was to keep regional parties at bay. Dismissing Congress as a force to reckon with in the state, he said, BJP was a natural choice before the people.

Comparing BJP with Congress of 1971, he said BJP had become so important, that the political scene revolved around it today.

The party, he said had also proved its worth under the leadership of Prime Minister Vajpayee, who had set the country on a path of progress and happiness.

So, he said, the BJP''s ''India Shining'' slogan was true in every bit, as was evident by facts.

In support of his contention, he said the country had become self-reliant and self-dependent in food, number of those living below poverty line (BPL) had come down from 32 per cent to 27 per cent and today the country had enough foreign reserves to give away loans to others.

BJP under the leadership of PM Vajpayee had decided to make India a strong nation by 2020 and for this unfinished task, the party needed the people''s mandate, he said.

3,The pain of water pinch,"LUCKNOW: Will there ever be enough water? This is one persistent question on every distressed resident''s lips these days. With the onset of summer comes scarcity of water, which means forming serpentine queues for it.

With strict water supply timings, for many it is better to get up early in the morning, run to the nearest tap or hand pump with buckets and stay ahead of others.

Such is the situation for residents in nearly half the city areas. A Martinpurwa resident says, ""There is hardly any water to drink, leave alone use it for other purposes. Officials never take note of this locality, which is worse than a slum"".

He added that when residents tried to raise their voice in support of civic facilities last year, they were lathi-charged by the police.

Residents of several localities like Jiamau, Dalibagh, Madiaon, Jankipuram, Haiderganj, Aminabad, Geeta Palli, Ghasiyari Mandi, Chowk, Nishatganj, Kashmiri Mohalla, Lakedmandi in Daliganj, Bhawaniganj and Rakabganj are some localities where water supply in summer is a major irritant. No matter how much authorities promise in this regard, nothing really happens.

Residents of Ghosiyana in Kaiserbagh falling in Peer Jaleel ward, where there was no water for nearly 10 days last year, have warned to go on a hunger strike, if the same situation occurs again this year.

In Yahiyaganj, the moment water supply starts, there is a rush to take in maximum water through motor pumps.

Those lucky enough to get some, realise soon enough that the water is polluted and not safe for drinking. The locality has been getting dirty water for the past three days.

Most localities are reeling under acute water shortage. Residents of Narhi, which includes localities like Raghuvir Dayal lane, Saket Palli, Mirabai Marg, Radha Krishna Mandir lane, Mallahapur have lost all hopes of getting sufficient water.

Out of the three tubewells in the area, only one remains functional. Residents say that tubewells belong to the Victorian era and are incapable of serving the whole area.

""The problem is that population is increasing and authorities are not increasing storage space for water,"" said a resident of Tikonia park.

Alambagh is yet another example of official indifference. Malin bastis like Dhobi ghat basti, Matapur Ka Hata and Shahi Masjid basti do not have a water pipeline at all.

More so, there is not a single hand pump for about two kilometres. Even colonies like Adarshnagar and Arjunnagar in Alambagh have only two out of nine hand pumps functional.

Residents of LDA colony on Kanpur Road believe that the water they are getting comes straight from a drainage.

Rajni Singh, a housewife, said the water they were getting had nullah smell in it. Dinesh, another resident said that even after filtering water using ''aquaguard'', water remained unhygienic.

4,He came back from dead and fought polls,"AZAMGARH: Lal Behari Mritak died in 1976. In 1989, he contested the Lok Sabha elections from Amethi against Rajiv Gandhi and lost. In 1991 and 2000, he stood for the Vidhan Sabha polls from Mubarakpur. This year too, he is going to file his nomination from Amilo Mubarakpur on April 3.

Uttar Pradesh. A place where hired killers can be bought for as little as Rs 500 and peasants make a living on plots as small as a basketball court.

Take these two ingredients -crime and a shortage of agricultural land - add a large chunk of greed, throw in some family rivalry and you come up with an ingenious scam.

Just head for the nearest Land Registry Office, bribe an official, declare the owner dead and transfer the land to your name.

""What can I say? A property dispute within our family led to my uncle producing a fake death certificate and announcing me dead in 1976. I only learned of my demise much later when due to my ''lack of living'' status, I was refused permission to file some official forms. ''I am standing right before you,'' I told the official. ''I don''t know all that. According to this paper, you are dead,'' he replied,"" says Lal Behari, the national president of the Mritak Sangh (Association of the Dead).

He''s tried many times to resurrect himself, including trying to claim widow benefits for his wife and running for a seat in Parliament to gain attention.

He also started the Association of the Dead with some 100 other citizens who were in a similar plight. Today, it has over 20,000 members nationally; some 10,000 are in UP alone.

""We also have NRI members who have been officially declared dead in India and are alive and well abroad,"" he says.

Come April 3 and Lal Behari will lie atop a set of wooden planks (arthi) and will be carried to the court from where he will file his nomination papers. Why so much drama?

""When an aggrieved party raises his voice against something, everyone says it is tamasha. Nobody understands our plight,"" he says angrily.

Kailash Yadav, a landless farm labourer, is another dead man walking. He moved to Lal Behari''s village. Kailash''s second cousins threatened to kill him if he tried to reclaim the 2,000 sq m of land which they stole from him.

When he first went to court to tell the magistrate he was alive, his cousins beat him. Lal Behari is trying to revive the case, now lost in the labyrinthian judicial system.

Further complicating his task is the fact that Kailash is not too keen either. ""It is better to be dead on paper than to be really dead. I think my cousins might actually kill me,"" he says.

5,"'Patriotism, flavour of the month'","HYDERABAD: Cricket is Mahesh Bhatt''s cup of tea but he refuses to buy the perception that the Indo-Pak cricket series could be the first step towards friendly ties between the two nations.

""Exchange of goodwill through sports cannot do what needs to be done on a long-term basis.We have to dismantle the biases built up over the last 50 years. These biases have got into the marrow of our bones,"" says the producer-director, who was in the city when Sourav''s boys locked horns with the Men in Green for the final one-day match.

""I watched the match with dread and hope -- dread that India would lose and hope that Irfan Pathan, Rahul Dravid and Mohd Kaif will win the match for us,"" he told The Times of India.

Irrespective of which part of the world he travels to, Mahesh Bhatt keeps tabs of the scorecard. Though he hasn''t crossed the border to watch the teams in action, he visited Pakistan for the Kara Film Festival in December.

""I was touched by their hospitality,"" he said. The spotlight now may is on cricket enthusiasts who sport both Indian and Pakistani flags, but Bhatt is cautious.

""External demonstrations of patriotism makes me suspicious. Maybe people want to compensate for a feeling they lack deep down. Cricket patriotism is just the flavour of the month, something that''s in vogue,"" he said.

Bilateral ties are still a long way off, he feels. ""Both the countries have to recognise that hatred has been harnessed for a long time. For those who''ve gone through the trauma of the partition, bitter memories linger. The younger generation, which has no reference to the past, has to root out religion completely,"" he says.

Bhatt lauds the fact that the youth feel it''s their right to rub shoulders with their neighbours. But he is sceptical about the result.

""Suddenly politicians want to play God and pretend to be apostles of peace. People have a mind of their own and will not sing a song that politicians want them to sing for a long time,"" adds Bhatt.

Bhatt doesn''t mince words and states that those in power use ''friendship with the enemy'' as a tool to stay perpetually in power.

7,Women's Bill will be passed: Mufti govt,"SRINAGAR: The Mufti Mohammad Sayeed-led government has said it will pass the controversial Permanent Resident (Disqualification) Bill, denying property rights to women marrying outsiders, as per the aspirations of the people of Jammu and Kashmir.

The Permanent Resident (Disqualification) Bill will be passed in the assembly as per the aspirations of the people of the state, minister for finance, law and parliamentary affairs Muzaffar Hussain Beig said addressing a PDP workersâ€™ convention at Bandipora in Baramulla district on Saturday.

â€œThe blood of Kashmiris wonâ€™t be allowed to go down the drain and the Permanent Resident (Disqualification) Bill will be passed which will automatically mean strengthening of Article 370, guaranteeing special status to the state in the Indian union,â€� he said.

Attacking Opposition National Conference, he said: â€œWe wonâ€™t change colours like chameleon as National Conference did. They used to talk in one tone in the state and in yet another tone at New Delhi.â€�

PDP president Mehbooba Mufti, addressing the convention, said her party was seriously working for safeguarding the human rights of people.

Accusing the National Conference of not caring for human rights during its rule in the state, the PDP chief said her party, unlike NC, was concerned over human rights violations which wonâ€™t be tolerated anymore.
