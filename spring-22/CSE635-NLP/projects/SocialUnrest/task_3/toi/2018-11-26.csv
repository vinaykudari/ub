11,Power likely to change hands in Lonavla municipal elections,"pune: with elections to the lonavla municipal council (lmc) drawing closer, major political parties are busy wooing a highly sceptical electorate.the reason: the earlier house had to be dissolved for rampant corruption after a popular people's campaign. although several other municipal councils in the state will also go to the polls on december 2, the lmc elections will be most interesting to watch because of its proactive voters. after last year's tumult, candidates of almost all traditional parties are finding it difficult to convince the voters that they are committed to putting the lmc back on track.a majority of the citizens in this hillstation are either in no mood to vote, or want to see a drastic change from the style and substance of the previous shiv sena-bjp-nagar vikas sanghatna dominated one which they helped kick out and the change may come via the shahar sudhar samiti, a newly formed entity. though it includes several members of the nationalist congress party (ncp) and may have to form an alliance with the congress eventually, it does have fresh faces and seems to have the backing of many citizens. the mood in the pretty hill-station, an hour's drive from pune, is against traditional parties and politicians, who, the people here feel, have let them down badly. says prakash parmar, proprieter of a gas agency, forget attracting tourists, the town does not have basic facilities for its residents. even our expectations of decent roads, potable water and uninterrupted electricity have not been met. the roads have not been resurfaced properly in at least ten years, he added. mr parmar, who has lived in lonavla all his life, says that uncontrolled construction of complexes and restaurants permitted by successive elected bodies have ruined the character of the town which could have attracted tourists. the lmc has not taken any worthwhile inititiative to develop tourism, he roars. ravi kakodkar laments that he had to send his children to pune and mumbai for studies as lonavla had a poor academic facilities. even neighbouring talegaon has a medical college, a big english medium school, which is absent in lonavla. like all other councils in the state, the lmc too will have elections under the new panel system. there are eight panels of which six have three wards each, while the remaining two have four.according to observers, the contest is mainly between the congress and the shahar sudhar samiti. by fielding relatively new faces with better educational qualifications, the samiti has ensured that citizens get to vote for change, says pannalal ostwal, a businessman in the town. the shahar sudhar samiti has already succeeded in drawing the support of the lonavla citizens' forum, a body representing eminent citizens from all walks of life. the post of president of the lmc is reserved for a woman from the other backward classes (obc) category. although there are five women in the fray, the main battle appears to be between shiela bankar of the sudhar samiti and surekha jadhav of the shiv sena. the candidate fielded by the congress, usha choudhary, is a political novice, though her husband has been councillor for four terms.the two independent candidates, najma maniyar and rupali andure, do not seem to be serious contenders. although the samiti has promised to deliver the goods, only time will tell if it will. but with citizens having already set a precedent of not tolerating corrupt officials, the message is clear for any ruling formation.

""however my most favoured sector in tripura is agriculture because it is the backbone of state's economy. kishan credit card figure in the state is very poor.the target is about 42,000 in the state of more than 32 lakhs people, majority of whom are involved in agriculture or allied sector. the kcc figure should be around 10 lakhs,"" madhukar added. he has instructed the banks to provide kccs to all existing agriculture borrowers by december 31. for good employment generation projects, ubi is ready to extend more than rs 50 crore in tripura, informed the bank chairman.

18,Nadeem to file suit against Indian govt in London,"mumbai: music composer nadeem akhtar saifee is contemplating to file a suit in a london court claiming substantial amount of damages from the indian government for ""falsely"" implicating him in the conspiracy leading to the murder of audio king gulshan kumar here in 1997, his lawyer majeed memon said here on monday. memon said that the sum of damages was not yet decided and he would visit london next month to discuss the issue with nadeem's lawyers in london, henry bradman, clive nicholls and james lewis. a london court had recently awarded to nadeem costs of litigation running into to one million pounds, equivalent to rs 6.5 crore, he said. the costs were awarded because the extradition case against nadeem failed to see through as house of lords discharged the music composer from the proceedings. on nadeem's future course of action, his lawyer said that the music composer would not defend himself in the trial court here and would not return to india unless the allegations against him were withdrawn, red corner notices issued to interpol be recalled and his travel documents returned. memon disagreed with recent media reports which quoted indian-born barrister at law bhaskar ghorpade saying that nadeem had escaped extradition because of lack of hindi translations of statements given by witnesses. the london court had observed that there was no evidence against nadeem and that improper pressure was used to obtain a statement from accused-turned-approver mohammed ali shaikh to make allegations against the music composer, memon said.
