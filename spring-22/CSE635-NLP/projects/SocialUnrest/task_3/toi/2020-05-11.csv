0,"Fulfil Gandhi's dreams, says minister","MOTIHARI: Mines minister of Bihar Sitaram Singh, while inaugurating a one-day seminar on ''Mahatma Gandhi and gram panchayat'' here on Saturday, called upon panchayati raj representatives to work in coordination with MLAs, MPs and MLCs to fulfil the dreams of the ''Father of the Nation'' Mahatma Gandhi.

More than 1,000 representatives of the three-tier panchayat raj system of East Champaran participated in this seminar.

The District Board chairman Rajendra Gupta presided over the seminar.

Singh said one needs to be organised to face the challenges of the programme that is in front of you. ""We should rise above brickering to see how best poverty can be removed.""

BJP MP Radha Mohan Singh said the statement that people of Bihar have, after 1947, once again gained freedom, would not be an exaggeration.

""When a person is struggling for power, he/she does not want to pass on the power enjoyed to anyone else. This is what has happened in Bihar.

Either it has to be snatched away at times, or else some pressure is applied. It is true that members of Parliament, members of legislative assembly or council and the network of bureaucracy are trying their best to control the three-tier panchayati raj system, he added.

Mahachandra Singh, MLC said that the architects of the Indian Constitution had felt that merely constituting institutions like the Parliament and legislative assemblies and councils will not help us in achieving self rule.

""Now you are going to shoulder a new responsibility. I agree that panchayats can work wonders in the field of social reform. We must make efforts.""

Bajrangi Narayan Thakur, Bibhuti Narayan Singh, Ram Pravesh Yadav and Ramadhar Tiwari also expressed their views.

Mukhiya Surendra Singh, said that six mukhiyas of the district have already been killed by criminals and others are being threatened by them.

However, no police action is being taken in this connection.

1,Sharad criticises 'lathi rally',"PATNA: JD(U) national president and Union food minister Sharad Yadav called upon the party workers to work for the Babubarahi (Madhubani district) by-elections, to be held on May 21. Addressing the 'Kisan-Majdoor Jagran Mahasangam' organised by the JD (U) Farmers' Cell at the S K Memorial Hall here on Sunday, he said that the voters had already rejected Laloo Prasad Yadav in the last Lok Sabha elections when he was defeated in Madhepura. ""If a ruling party organises a 'lathi rally' it reflects the party's inaction and weakness. When the entire government machinery are with the RJD government, what was the need of organising a 'lathi-rally', said the minister. ""The people had voted for the RJD-government for developmental works and not to make wasteful expenditures in organising rallies or 'raillas'"", he added saying that it is for the opposition to organise rallies. He also said that he is ready to construct godowns in Bihar within 6 months for storage of foodgrains upto 3 lakh MT, but it is possible only when the state government provides land. Farmers's cell state president Mundrika Singh Yadav presided over the meet. Talking about capital investment from foreign countries in Bihar he said that the ambitious Maitreyee Project of Rs 900 crore could not be implemented in Bodh Gaya, as the Bihar government failed to provide land for the same. He also assailed the state government for not lifting foodgrains for the implementation of welfare schemes like BPL families, mid-day meal, Antyoday Yojna etc. sponsored by the Central governmnet for school children. ""It was Laloo, who left a national party and formed a regional party with his lantern, which has no kerosene oil"", he said saying that he should have given the slogan of ""sampradayikta bhagao Bihar bachao"" instead of ""Desh bachao"". Speaking on the occasion JD(U) parliamentary party leader and former state president Ramjeevan Singh, said that as per reports of the 10th Five-Year Plan, Bihar has the lowest position in literacy among 28 states and 5 Union territories. ""It is wrong to blame the Central government always and talk of 'step motherly treatment', which is eveident from the reports of the 10th Five Year Plan. The state has failed to utilise even the funds allotted by the Central government,"" Singh added. JD(U) state president Sheonandan Jha, working president Gajendra Prasad Himanshu, Ram Nath Thakur, Vijendra Prasad Yadav, MLA, Tanbir Ahmad, MLC, also spoke on the occasion. A number of resolutions were also adopted at the meeting.

2,MCD trucks under police scanner,"NEW DELHI: The Municipal Corporation of Delhi's ill-maintained trucks are being routinely prosecuted by the traffic police for the last two weeks. ""We have prosecuted many MCD trucks in the last 10 days and impounded those which were not fit to be on the road,"" said Pradeep Hota, deputy commissioner of police (northern range-traffic). The police found these trucks, most of which carried garbage, in poor shape. One of these trucks had killed three persons and injured another three in an accident last month. ""Many of these trucks did not have headlights. They were also devoid of indicators,"" Hota said. Without lights, they are not visible in the night and cause accidents on the road. In many of these prosecuted trucks, the number plates are also not easy to read as they are covered by filth. The MCD fleet comprises 693 trucks, of which only 342 are plying. The rest have gone for repairs. MCD officials admit their trucks are in a state of disrepair. After depositing the garbage at a landfill site drivers are supposed to get their trucks cleaned, but this is rarely done. A corporation official admitted that all trucks had to be cleaned every two days, but they were not being washed for months. As a result, the vehicles started wearing out and breakdown became more common. While many allege that these trucks are over 15 years old, traffic police officials say that even if they are not, they look pretty old due to poor upkeep. ""The drivers told us that the brakes are not functioning, gears are not well-oiled, they don't have proper knobs to hold. These are not visible from outside, but are extremely dangerous on the roads,"" a senior traffic police official said. Even the driver's cabin, traffic police officers say, is very ill-maintained. Said Hota,""For example, the driver's back rest is missing. Now if the driver applies sudden brakes, it is bound to hurt him. He can even lose control over the vehicle."" Lifespan of such trucks is about 10 years and 10 per cent of the equipment needs regular replacement. ""Since that is rarely done, these vehicles look shabby. And garbage trucks on roads are a nuisance if not maintained properly,"" a police officer said.

3,Protest against govt's policies,"LUCKNOW: On the occasion of the 146th anniversary of the 1857 war of independence, the All-India Students Association (Aisa) and the Inqualabi Naujavan Sabha (Inaus) took out a procession, from Charbagh to Residency, against the imperialistic policies of the government.

Making a call for renaming Residency as ''Wajid Ali Shah Sangrahlaya'' and establishing memorials and installing statues of freedom fighters, Aisa president Kavita Krishnan said that the government was deliberately trying to sideline freedom fighters, which was a matter of habit for a party, which even during the independence struggle worked more as informers of the British than for the country.

The same policy was being followed by them even after they were in power. At the Lucknow Residency, the site of the three-month-long historic siege, there were no statues or pillars to commemorate the martyrs. There was nothing to honour the memory of Maulvi Ahmadullah, Lakshmibai, Udabai, Begum Hazrat Mahal, Mangal Pandey, Kunwar Singh or the thousands of peasants who, with their blood, laid the foundations of India''s progressive secular nationalism. Instead, there were pillars erected by the British, she said.

Krishnan, along with Inaus president Mithilesh Yadav and general secretary Lalbahadur Singh, proceeded towards Residency amid sloganeering after burning a Cola bottle cut-out which, they stressed, was a symbol of slavery.

Addressing a gathering of activists from nearby states, CPI (ML) state secretary Akhilendra Pratap Singh said that in the garb of Ramjanambhoomi issue, which was based on pseudo nationalism, the Sangh parivar was trying to make a Hindu sthan out of Hindustan.

4,Union govt neglecting higher education: LU Prof,"LUCKNOW: Criticising the Union government for neglecting the higher education, Mohd Muzammil, economist and professor in Lucknow University, said that while the developed nations were spending huge amounts on higher education, the Centre was not initiating any step for its promotion. He added that the government should realise that the country could not be developed without the development of human resources.

Delivering a lecture on the ''Indian economy: conditions and challenges'' organised by the Kalam Vichar Manch at the auditorium of department of public administration, LU on Saturday, he said that the government''s decision to privatise the health, higher education and other sectors negated the very purpose for which the Planning Commission was formed in the country.

He said that in the globalisation era, the developed and developing nations were entering into agreements on equal grounds which was not a healthy trend. It did not provide a level playing field to the developing nations, he added.

5,Campaign to counter violence against women,"LUCKNOW: Suraksha, a city-based anti-dowry demand organisation, in collaboration with public affairs department, American embassy, New Delhi, is organising a three-day campaign, starting on May 12, to counter violence against women.

6,SP demonstration to be a show of strength,"LUCKNOW: The Samajwadi Party''s May 12 demonstration to be led by party president Mulayam Singh Yadav is clearly aimed at conveying to chief minister Mayawati that the party will not be cowed down by her repressive measures. In addition, it is also being viewed as SP''s show of strength despite the attempts made to ensure that party workers do not reach the state capital.

Pepped up by the response which the party''s cycle yatra generated and emboldened by the order of the court against the FIRs slapped on Yadav and other party workers, the SP workers are all set to expose the anti-people policies of the present government, besides conveying that they will not allow Mayawati to throttle democracy. Yadav''s recent statement that the state government could arrest him during Monday''s demonstration has also to be seen in this perspective.

Addressing a press conference on Sunday, state general secretary Shivpal Singh Yadav reiterated that the government was going all out to sabotage the demonstration. He said district officials were denying permits to buses and trucks and SP workers were not being allowed to come to the state capital.

The cycle yatra which had initially been started to expose the Mayawati government took on a different colour when the CM announced the slapping of 137 FIRs on Yadav and other party leaders and workers. This incensed the SP activists immensely who took to the yatra with a vengeance.

The party workers will converge at the SP office from where they will begin their march at 10 am. Led by the party president himself, in addition to other national and state level leaders, the demonstrators will wound their way through the Loreto Convent crossing, GPO, Hazratganj, Mayfair crossing, Lalbagh and the Qaiserbagh crossing. It will culminate in a sabha at the collectorate.

With the SP leaders maintaining that the government was sparing no efforts to sabotage the demonstration and also not precluding the possibility of violence, Monday''s demonstration may take any turn. The state government, on its part, has undertaken heavy security measures with barricades put up on the route to be taken by demonstrators.

7,CM's saviours may turn govt undertakers,"LUCKNOW: Are the criminal-turned-politician saviours of the Mayawati government all set to play the undertakers for her regime? Well, going by recent developments, the answer remains an emphatic ''yes''. And the manner in which these saviours are causing embarrassment to the chief minister, it seems the the time is not far when their support to Mayawati and her government may emerge as the only factor responsible for the debacle of Maya rule in Uttar Pradesh.

Right from Mukhtar Ansari who pledged his support from behind the bars to Mayawati during the trial of strength on the floor of the House to Akhilesh Singh and Amarmani Tripathi, all better known in the underworld than in the world of politics, had pledged their support to Mayawati time and again. Not only this, Amarmani Tripathi was even being seen as the man behind orchestrating the split in the Congress and ensuring that a chunk of its MLAs got to sit on the treasury benches in the Vidhan Sabha. And it was apparently this undue recognition awarded to these ganglords-turned-politicians that they unleashed terror in their terrains. Murders, kidnappings and land- grabbing, all executed allegedly by either these top names or by their cohorts left the state government in general and chief minister Mayawati in particular in quite a few embarrassing situations.

When Mukhatr Ansari, convicted by the Delhi High Court under the Tada, walked out of the Lucknow district jail recently and visited the director general of police headquarters, the issue saw an angry Mayawati clipping the wings of the don in all earnestness. Within the next couple of days Mukhtar was shunted back to Tihar jail despite all the hue and cry he raised against his transfer.

Then came the founder MLA of Akhil Bharatiya Congress Dal (ABCD) Akhilesh Singh from Rae Bareli who left Congress party to ""strengthen"" the government, then was left in the lurch by the chief minister and, recently, kidnapped two associates of a contractor and, while trying to escape, indulged in heavy exchange of fire with the police on the roads of his home constituency. Despite the spine-chilling kidnapping and the hot police pursuit, Akhilesh is still at large. That he has supported the Mayawati government during the recent crisis is alleged to have been the reason behind him being away from the reach of the police.

For Amarmani Tripathi, since the day he took oath of office as minister for government press every now and then his name has figured in the local media, be it an alleged land-grabbing case in Basti and the subsequent High Court order directing him to hand over the land to its rightful owner or now the murder of Madhumita Shukla, a 24-year-old poetess in Lucknow. All these incidents have had Amarmani Tripathi as the common factor as far as allegations from the victims are concerned.

Tall claims of chief minister Mayawati of improving the crime and law and order situation in the state notwithstanding, the brazen acts of these few MLAs has left the Bahujan Samaj Party-led coalition in a tight spot for more than once. And if the reported concern of Mayawati over the alleged involvement of Amarmani''s wife into the murder of Madhumita is any indication, it is not very unlikely that these very MLAs who saw her government through at times of crises on the floor of the House may finally land as the sole cause of her party facing the ire of voters.

8,TDP gears up to hold 'incident-free' Mini Mahanadus,"HYDERABAD: The Telugu Desam Party is gearing up for Mini Mahanadus to be held from Monday. District committees have been instructed to pass at least 27 draft resolutions, which would be ratified at the Mahanadu at Tirupati on May 27.

According to sources, the Mini Mahanadus would be videographed and the best performing districts would be presented awards at the Mahanadu in Tirupati. Important draft resolutions that would be passed by the district committees include power sector reforms, social welfare, role of the government in poverty eradication, irrigation policy, agriculture policy, law and order, health and development of backward areas.

Interestingly, for the first time the party has officially referred to â€˜Telanganaâ€™ in the resolutions under the agenda for development of backward areas. The party claims that â€œthe entire Telangana is not backward, but only parts of the region are underdevelopedâ€�.

The Congress has been criticised in a majority of the resolutions for politicising most of the issues. The role of chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in the development of the state has been repeatedly emphasised in most of the resolutions. Party sources said resolutions pertaining to respective districts and issues of relevance to the entire state could also be passed at the Mini-Mahanadus.

Meanwhile, Naidu, in a teleconference with party leaders, on Sunday reviewed preparations for the Mini Mahanadus. He reportedly directed leaders to ensure that the Mini Mahanadus are incident-free.

Naidu also instructed leaders to identify families below the poverty line for distribution of 1.5 lakh whitecards during the Janmabhoomi programme. The MLAs have been told to tour their constituencies three days every week and submit reports on drought relief works.

9,12 armed men rob Mehrauli farmhouse,"NEW DELHI: About 12 armed men allegedly forced their way into a Mehrauli farmhouse and decamped with Rs 1 lakh after tying up 10 workers on Sunday morning.

The incident took place at about 7 am at a farmhouse on Dera-Mandi Road in Mehrauli. The property owned by Anil Jain houses about 12 workers. The cash, meant to be distributed among the employees of the farmhouse was reportedly kept in an almirah in the servants'' quarter. The almirah was pulled out of the room after breaking a lock.

The police said a case of theft was registered on the basis of the statement of Mahesh (28), the farmhouse guard. ""He has been changing his statements and we are yet to verify his version about the incident,"" said a Mehrauli police official.

He said the guard''s version was unreliable as nobody, including the two pet dogs in the farmhouse, noticed any commotion despite the alleged forced entry.

10,"Eve-teasing leads to clash, 1 killed","HYDERABAD: Tension prevailed at Sadullanagar in Moulali on Sunday following clashes between two rival groups since Saturday evening in which one man was killed and another injured while one house was set on fire.

Police said that a five-member gang â€” Mohammed Omar, Sharfu, Najju, Azmath and Anwar, all residents of Sadullanagar â€” raided the house of Mohammed Karim on Saturday night. The gang pulled out Karim (50) and his brother, Mohammed Chand (45), out of the house and stabbed them and fled.

Neighbours rushed them to Gandhi Hospital, where Karim died later, while Chandâ€™s condition is said to be critical.

Police said Karim had picked up a quarrel with the members of the gang and asked them not to tease women by sitting near his shop. He used to quarrel with the gang over the issue. About 15 days ago, the gang disconnected the power supply to a public borewell due to which residents of the colony were put to hardships.

Karim and Chand had complained to local politicians about the incident and got the power supply restored. Enraged over this, Najju intentionally came to Karimâ€™s shop on Saturday evening and wanted to buy some gutkha which was out of stock. He picked up a quarrel with Karim and began creating nuisance. The latter pushed Najju away.

Later at around 11 pm Najju along with his associates raided Karimâ€™s residence and stabbed the two brothers.

While taking back Karimâ€™s body to his house on Sunday afternoon, irate relatives ransacked Najjuâ€™s house and set fire to it. A police picket has been posted in the locality to prevent deterioration in law and order.

12,BJP seeks fresh election,"KOLKATA: Terming the entire panchayat elections a sham, the West Bengal BJP on Sunday called for ""fresh elections, in an atmosphere where people could file their nominations without risking death"".

Speaking to the media after the end of polling, state BJP President Tathagata Roy said the death of 110 people in an election was a ""national tragedy"".

Roy said mass scale violence, bombing and booth capturing in almost all districts clearly exposed that ""state sponsored terrorism has won the day"".

Senior BJP leader and Union minister Tapan Sikdar said he would send a detailed report on CPMâ€™s booth capturing and violence to the Union home ministry in a day or two and demand proper action.

According to the BJP, large-scale bombing has occurred in Nadiaâ€™s Dignagar, in Baruipur and other areas of South 24 Parganas and in Howrahâ€™s Balijagacha. Instances of booth capturing has been reported from over 5,000 places including Domjur, Canning, Jalangi, Chapadanga, Singur and Egra.

In Canning CPM minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah himself co-ordinated the attacks on rival candidates, sitting in Writers Buildings, the BJP state president said.

Though no BJP candidate had been killed till evening, at least 12 members were injured in Nadia and North 24 Parganas, he said. Some ballot boxes were snatched, Roy added.

The state BJP president blamed the CPM for the violence. ""The state election commissioner has been behaving like a CPM cadre all through the last month. We cannot expect justice from CPM stooge. But right now since he happens to be sitting in the SECâ€™s chair, we have faxed him a letter demanding a fresh start to the election process"".

Roy also blamed the police for being ""extremely uncooperative and passive onlookers"".

""On Saturday night CPM cadres burnt three houses belonging to BJP members. But when our boys went to the Hingalganj police station to file an FIR naming the 16 people who carried out the attack, the police instead actually booked seven of our men and put them in the lockup,"" he said.

13,Congress wants repoll but not President's rule,"KOLKATA: Blaming the CPM for resorting to large-scale violence during the panchayat polls on Sunday, the state Congress demanded repoll 76 booths but refrained from asking for a fresh election in the state.

Describing the violence and death on the day of the sixth panchayat poll as unprecedented in the electoral history in West Bengal, state Congress president Pranab Mukherjee also alleged that two CPM ministers had personally led their supporters in Murshidabad and Nadia in violence and booth capturing.

Aware that most of the clashes that occurred during the day were between the CPM and the Congress, Mukherjee said, ""The violence unleashed by the CPM began during the campaigning and has continued till the day of the poll. First the CPM prevented the Opposition candidates from filing nominations. Then they began the violence in Chopra where nine persons were killed. The third part was enacted today during the polls,"" he said.

Mukherjee alleged that two Left Front ministers â€” Anisur Rahman and Nayan Sarkar â€” had misused their official position by capturing booths in Murshidabad and Nadia.

""State animal husbandry minister Anisur Rahman used his official vehicle at Domkal in Murshidabad district and led his supporters during poll violence and booth capturing, while minister of state for refugee rehabilitation Nayan Sarkar did the same at Hanskhali in Nadia,"" Mukherjee said.

Sharply criticising the state election commissionerâ€™s claims that the polls had been by and large peaceful, Mukherjee said, ""So many people have died. So many allegations of booth capturing have reached the SEC. Yet he (the CM) describes the election as peaceful. This is a reflection of a perverted mind.""

Stating that the law and order situation in the state was in a bad shape, Mukherjee, however, refrained from demanding Central intervention, as demanded by Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee. ""If she can get it done, let her go ahead. The NDA has a majority in the Rajya Sabha. Why do they ask for the support of the Congress,"" he said.

The state Congress demanded repolling in 18 booths in Murshidabad, 12 in North 24 Parganas, 14 in Burdwan, 17 in East Midnapore, three in Malda, two in Howrah and one booth in Hooghly.

14,"Oppn slams poll violence, RSP threatens pullout","KOLKATA: The unprecedented violence during Sunday's panchayat polls elicited varied reactions from Opposition parties. Some sought the sacking of the Left Front government, others demanded that the entire election be cancelled. Left Front partner RSP, which repeatedly clashed with the CPM in South and North 24-Parganas, Murshidabad and Malda, threatened to reconsider its decision to stay in government. The CPM though described the polling as generally peaceful. Trinamul chief Mamata Banerjee demanded that the Left Front government be sacked for making a mockery of the elections. She also came down hard on the state election commissioner, calling him worthless and a CPM stooge. Under instructions from the chief minister, the CPM ministers and senior police officials worked in tandem with militant groups and terrorists from across the border to throttle democracy. Thirteen people have already died and over 50 are seriously injured. Moving beyond political affiliations, this is a loss to humanity, she said. She alleged that the CPM had cut off all communication links to the districts. The telephones are not working. Even roads and bridges have been blocked. We can get the actual picture only when our leaders return from the districts. Calling Sunday's polls the goriest of all elections in West Bengal till date, she said there would be no democracy in the state till the CPM remained in power. This is a constitutional crisis and I have sent detailed reports to the Prime Minister and the Union home minister. I think the BJP has done the same. All Opposition parties should come together to restore democracy in the state, Banerjee added. Leader of the Opposition Pankaj Banerjee said Trinamul MLAs would meet on Thursday to decide a strategy, depending upon the poll results. BJP state president Tathagata Roy called for fresh elections, where people would be able to contest without fear. He described the violence at polling booths as an instance of state-sponsored terrorism. The Congress stopped short of demanding a fresh election, but demanded repoll in 67 booths. Angry over the death of two of its women supporters, SUCI leader Provas Ghosh said the CPM had taken criminals from the southern suburbs of Kolkata to panchayat areas in South 24-Parganas to create terror.

Party president M Venkaiah Naidu said: ""The elections there should be cancelled, new poll dates announced and a fresh campaign permitted.""

Naidu also called for a national debate on a change in the setting up of state election commissions. He suggested that they should be made into independent bodies on the lines of the Election Commission of India.

""The state governments should have no hand in the appointments to or constitution of these bodies,"" he said, accusing the Left Front government of manipulating the state election commission.

Stressing that the BJP and its partner, the Trinamul Congress, would raise the matter in the forthcoming monsoon session of Parliament, he said: ""We will be meeting Trinamul leaders soon to decide on a joint agitation programme on the issue.""

It has also disputed accusations that its activists did not permit opposition candidates to file their nominations and said that it is not their job to find candidates for the opposition.

Addressing party workers during a day-long state-wide fast in favour of its demands, National Executive member and state Vice-president P S Sreedharan Pillai said investigation by state agencies ""lacked credibility"" in the backdrop of suspicions about the role of a prominent member of UDF ministry in the events leading to the Marad incident.

Since the Marad incident gave strong clues about the active presence of fundamentalist forces in the state, government should implement Pota to tackle the threat effectively, he said.

Reacting to the Union Minister of State for Defence''s statement at Marad on Sunday that CBI should probe the incident in the backdrop of ""mounting allegations"" against a state minister, UDF convenor Oommen Chandy and KPCC president K Muraleedharan said the Minister''s open remarks amounted to a challenge to federal norms.

In a statement here, Oommen Chandy said being a Union Minister, Rajagopal should have furnished proof to substantiate his charges. It was unfortunate he was becoming part of the attempts to gain political mileage out of the Marad incident.

Later in the night, Bhagat''s mutiliated body was recovered,"" said Narayan Ghosh, DIG (HQ).

Five JKP workers were arrested from the area. However, CPM-JKP clashes continued even on Monday. Even while Bhagat was being cremated, JKP supporter Madan Mondal''s body was recov-ered from Balia village. JKP activists had allegedly attacked the village and Mondal died in a CPM retaliatory attack. According to Ghosh, Mondal was wanted for the murder of local CPM leader Dibakar Mondal. Clashes between the RSP and CPM continued in South 24-Parganas.

According to police, 38 people were injured in poll violence since Sunday. ""Police fired 38 rounds in nine places. 149 people were arrested â€” 34 are CPM men while 26 are RSP supporters. The rest are Trinamul or Congress workers. In Joynagar''s booth 136, the SUCI withdrew their polling agent and boycotted the polls,"" Ghosh said.

While admitting that there was chance of post-poll violence in the districts, Ghosh claimed that most of the violence till date had occurred in areas with no past history. ""We had not anticipated violence in these areas. Though nearly 200,000 security personnel were on duty, half were unarmed home guards.""

Rapid Action Force and commandos will be on duty for counting on Tuesday. ""We anticipate no violence near the counting booths."" Ghosh said.
