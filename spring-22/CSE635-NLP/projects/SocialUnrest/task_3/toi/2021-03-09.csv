0,PCB orders removal of illegal political posters,"PUNE: Coming down heavily on unauthorised political posters dotting the Camp area, the Pune Cantonment Board (PCB) has directed the respective parties to remove the hoardings and cloth banners in the area by March 10.

PCB cantonment executive officer A. Bhaskar Reddy told TNN on Monday that not a single political hoarding, paper poster or cloth banner erected in area was authorised. â€œWe have not given permission to any political party,â€� Reddy said. In the last one month, many cloth banners, posters and paper cut-outs of major political parties have mushroomed in the area.

While some hoardings tout the success of their political parties, others carry birthday wishes, welcome greetings and success wishes to political leaders for the forthcoming LS polls. At a meeting on Friday, where representatives from major political parties were invited, Reddy directed removal of the posters by Wednesday.

Activists from the Shiv Sena, Congress, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), among others, attended the meeting. Political posters and hoardings appear a common feature on M.G. Road, East Street, Babasaheb Ambedkar Road, Moledina Road and Boottee Street.

Pointing out at one such poster, obstructing the traffic signal at the junction of M.G. Road and Moledina Road, Suman Mehta, a resident of the area, said, â€œEveryday, during peak hours there is a traffic jam and chaos in the area as the poster blocks a clear view of the traffic signal.â€�

Reddy said, â€œIf the parties fail to remove the hoardings by Wednesday, then,we will remove them ourselves and complain to the Election Commission (EC) about it.â€� Last month, the Defence Estates Office (DEO) pulled down over 20 unauthorised commercial hoardings.

A notification issued last year by the urban development department states: â€œNo hoarding shall be permitted on or around buildings of archaeological, historical or heritage importance or come in the way of erection of any such building or monumentâ€�.

1,Women bring in value-based politics: Gujrathi,"MUMBAI: â€œWomenâ€™s representation in the state assembly is currently less than five per cent. More women should contest the elections as they bring in value-based politics,â€™â€™ speaker of the state assembly Arun Gujrathi observed on Womenâ€™s Day on Monday.

Mr Gujrathi was speaking at the inaugural function of a six-month educational course at the S.P. Jain Institute of Management and Research (APJIMR) in Andheri aimed at educating women who plan to join politics.

The diploma programmeâ€˜Women and Political Governanceâ€™, created jointly by the Times Foundation, Womenâ€™s Movement for Peace and Prosperity (WMPP) and SPJIMR is the first initiative of the kind to train women for mainstream Indian politics and governance.

Inaugurating the programme, Maharashtra governor Mohammed Fazal spoke about the present-day image of the Indian politician as a â€˜rowdyâ€™ and a â€˜cheatâ€™, and of the need to change it. The governor also pointed out instances where women had been put in important political positions for namesake.

Although admissions to the course will begin in July this year, details like the criteria for selection, fee structure and class strength are still being worked out. The course will be a six-hour, nonconventional training programme run only on Saturdays and Sundays.

It comprises a motley mix of subjects to introduce the candidates to various aspects of politics like cultivating leadership qualities, budget presentations, workings of the local corporations, the state assembly and parliament, the Indian constitution andfundraising for political parties.

Also present at the function were Leena Prabhoo, general secretary, WMPP, local MP Sunil Dutt, Dr Sneha Palnitkar, Director, All India Institute of Local Self Governance and Dr M.L. Shrikant, Dean SPJIMR.

2,Upright Mhada bosses invite govt wrath,"MUMBAI: Bureaucrat U P S Madan, unceremoniously shunted out recently as vicepresident of the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (Mhada), is one among the many officers holding this post who have been victimised by successive state governments.

In fact, such is the sensitive nature of this post that in the past decade no government has allowed a single officer to complete his threeyear tenure in Mhada.

Ministerial interference in the allotment of lucrative plots and award of multicrore contracts have often been a bone of contention between powerful politicians and upright officers who have held this post.

Honest bureaucrats who refused to succumb to political pressure found themselves shunted out within a year. Some unscrupulous officers, who were actively conniving with ministers, also could not complete their term because they were embroiled in somany controversies that the government had no choice but to transfer them.

â€œAn upright officer cannot survive in this post for long. Mr Madan was fortunate that the government allowed him to survive here for 17 months,â€™â€™ a senior government source told TNN.

Ratnakar Gaikwad was Mhada VP for barely 11 months in 1992-93 when he was shunted out. He cracked down on a corrupt IAS officer, eight years his senior, who was indulging inmalpractices in a World Bank-sponsored housing project in Mumbai.

Instead of supporting him, the then Congress government transferred Mr Gaikwad as well as the errant officer to show that it was only a personal tiff between the two.

Sometime later, the IAS officer was dismissed from service. R C Iyer, who recently completed his tenure as deputy Lok Ayukta, also served in Mhada for less than six months between September 1993 and February 1994.

Bureaucrat Swadhin Kshatriya had a comparatively longer runof 22 months as MhadaVP between 1997 and 1999. However, the shortest ever tenure was that of Subodh Kumar, who was VP for just over 40 days.

Mr Madan is the latest victim of the governmentâ€™s machinations. It was his refusal to allot a prime plot of land at Bandra Reclamation to a builder at a throwaway price that finally brought about his downfall.

3,J&K govt does a rethink on property law,"JAMMU: The nationwide outcry over a legislation that erodes property and job rights of a large chunk of Kashmiri women forced a rethink on it by the state''s ruling coalition on Monday.

BJP raised the stakes over J&K''s controversial ""anti-women"" bill with prime minister Vajpayee calling on the state government to repeal it.

Vajpayee joined the outcry as Congress president Sonia Gandhi tried to distance herself from the embarrassment caused at the national level by her party''s sponsoring the bill.

The distancing act found expression in Gandhi''s letter to CM Mufti Mohammad Sayeed, asking him to put on hold the legislation ""which curtails rights of women.""

Rebuked by the high command for co-authoring the bill with Sayeed''s PDP, Congress'' J&K unit scrambled to distance itself.

Congress leader and deputy CM Mangat Ram Sharma said the bill was hastily crafted and needed to be reviewed by a Legislative Council committee.

Another coalition partner, Panthers Party, which supported the Bill on Friday, threatened to withdraw support to Sayeed if it was not abandoned immediately.

4,"ICRA, fin min clash on growth projections","NEW DELHI: The jury is still out on whether India can sustain this year''s strong economic growth into the next and beyond.

The finance ministry on Monday reiterated its optimism that the officially estimated 8.1 per cent GDP growth this year is not just a sole-year phenomenon on the back of lavish monsoon rains.

India, it feels, is firmly on the high road, set to grow at 8-10 per cent a year in the next two decades.

Other forecast agencies are, however, not that sure. Rating agency, ICRA, for instance, declared on Monday that India''s growth could plummet to 6.4 per cent next fiscal.

Last fiscal, India managed a meagre four per cent GDP growth and the average for the last decade has been about 6 per cent.

5,SP’s brainstorming session on LS polls,"LUCKNOW: Moving in the direction of establishing its presence as a national party, around 10,000 workers and office-bearers of Samajwadi Party will converge at the party office on Tuesday to participate in a workersâ€™ sammelan. The sammelan will be addressed by party president Mulayam Singh Yadav.

While the names of the candidates are yet to be made public it is learnt that many new faces would be given a chance keeping in view winnability and caste combination as the main criterion. Among the names doing the round are Prof Ram Gopal from either Sambhal or Mainpuri, Akhilesh Yadav from Kannuaj, Raj Babbar from Agra, Mukhatar Anis or Ranjana Bajpai from Sitapur. For Lucknow, the name much in circulation is that of Dr Madhu Gupta.

Brahamins have had a sway over Sitapur and ten out of total 13 MPs from here had been from this caste. So, SP hopes to make a formidable support base in this constituency by fielding Ranjana Bajpai, national president of the womenâ€™s wing, who also hails from this area.

The sammelan, first after the model code of conduct came into force, will have the impending parliamentary elections on its agenda. The party has already announced its intent of contesting 250 seats from all over the country of which the bulk will be from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. The other states in which the party aims at opening its account include Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Haryana, Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttaranchal, Maharashtra, Orissa, Kerala, West Bengal, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Chattisgarh and Assam.

While office-bearers of the national and state working committees will be present in full strength, others who would be participating are presidents, vice-presidents, treasurers and general secretaries of the state/district/city units. Former and present MPs and legislators have been asked to be present. The sammelan would also be attended by former and present panchayat members, block pramukhs, nagar nigam and nagar palika members as also the corporators.

With the election dates already announced, the party presidentâ€™s message to the workers is expected to centre around bagging the maximum number of seats, so that the SP establishes its presence as a national party. Already a target of 60 seats has been fixed for Uttar Pradesh which has a total of 80 Lok Sabha seats.

6,EC meet on elections security,"LUCKNOW: Chief electoral officer Vijay Sharma held a meeting with senior police officials, including IG law and order, to discuss measures for peaceful conduct of elections in Uttar Pradesh. The focus of the meeting was preventing anti-socials from influencing the course of elections.

The meeting assumes significance in light of zonal IGâ€™s opinion that Bulandshahr, Muzaffarnagar and Bagpat may be declared as sensitive seats. The chief electoral officer however said that declaring areas as sensitive was done from law and order point of view and EC had no role in it.Sources said in this region there were more than 20,000 licenced arms.

Sharma said that pending warrants and challans should be implemented, besides constant checking of arms and ammunition shops.

7,What policing? Fear rules the road,"NEW DELHI: It''s particularly galling to wake up on Women''s Day and read about a rape. The victim, a Fijian of Indian origin, was whisked away in an inebriated state by a fellow reveller from the discotheque of a five-star hotel and raped.

The accused is a well-to-do businessman, and many in his peer group will wonder what the fuss is all about. A woman, a foreigner, drunk ... doesn''t all this suggest ""asking for it""?

Activists have unsuccessfully tried to change this attitude. The bigger tragedy is that even stone-cold sober women going about their daily business are equally vulnerable.

Since January 1 this year, 73 rapes have been reported. Sixty-five cases were reported in the corresponding period last year. A total number of 450 rape cases were reported in Delhi in 2003.

""There is no fear of the law,"" says Delhi Commission for Women chairperson Kiran Walia.

""There are so many girls who travel to Gurgaon and Okhla for their jobs. What security do they have?"" she asks. The Swiss and MAMC rape case is a glaring example of weak police patrolling.

And has the police been successfully sensitised after decades of activism on the subject.

Here is what the joint commissioner of police especially entrusted with the task of minimising crimes against women, Vimla Mehra said: ""How can you say the number of rapes has gone up?""

Asked whether patrolling should be stepped up at the deserted Deer Park near which the latest incident took place, she replied: ""One day, people ask for security in parking lots, the next day they want it in parks. I don''t want to comment on this issue. You make whatever assessments you want."" She then shunted the reporter off.

8,Pubs openly flout the law,"NEW DELHI: Delhi excise commissioner Ranbir Singh has asked for police records in the rape of a 19-year-old Fijian girl, who was allegedly served liqour at Djinns, the pub at Hyatt Regency Hotel in Delhi before the incident.

""It is illegal under the Punjab Excise Act to serve liqour to anyone under the age of 25 in Delhi,"" he said.

It is also illegal to serve liqour after 11 pm, unless with a special permission sought by the restaurant in question. The Fijian girl was picked up at 12.30 pm outside the hotel.

But what is unfolding now is a blame game between the police and the excise department. Each claim the other is responsible for regulating the law.

Admitting that the norms are often openly flouted, Singh said: ""We do carry out inspections. It''s imperative to send officers late in the night as decoy customers in order to really nab defaulters.""

Singh said only a fortnight ago, the department had raided about 17 establishments serving liqour, of which 14 had been found guilty of keeping bars open beyond the permissable limit of 11 pm.

Nearly 80 per cent of the 182 restaurants and pubs which have liqour licenses flout the timings imposed by the law.

Only 22 out of 182 etablishments with liqour licences have special permission to remain open till midnight or at the most 1 am, they added.

9,BJP finalises 12 candidates for LS polls,"KOLKATA: Failing to resolve differences over allocation of two seats with their senior partner in West Bengal, the Trinamool Congress, the BJP on Monday finalised names of candidates for 12 of the 13 seats, given to it so far.

Sources in state BJP said that another round of talks was likely on Monday night between TC supremo Mamata Banerjee and its state chief Tathagata Roy to end the stalemate over Bankura and Purulia.

TC had unilaterally announced their candidates from Bankura and Purulia constituencies despite BJP''s claim over these seats and said a seat would be given to its ally in lieu of Purulia.

The state BJP President Tathagata Roy meanwhile said the party had finalised the names of nominees for the 12 seats already allocated it.

He said the candidate list would be sent to the party high command for approval.

When asked whether BJP had given up its claim on the two seats, Roy said that the party was still sticking to its demand, but declined further comment.

State BJP sources, however, said that the TC had invited the party chief for another round of talks tonight to end the current impasse.

To a question whether it had received any indication from its poll partner on getting one of these seats, the sources replied, ""we hope TC will give one of the two seats to us.""

10,Strict action drives Blueline owner to suicide,"NEW DELHI: The action of the transport department and traffic police against rogue Blueline drivers seems to have left bus operators worried. On Wednesday, a Blueline owner, Parvinder, allegedly committed suicide in Mukherjee Nagar.

A representative of the bus owners'' association claimed that the ongoing action against buses had led to Parminder''s suicide.

The transport department and the traffic police, in separate drives, have impounded over 1,600 buses in the last few weeks.

Transport commissioner Rajeev Talwar said: ""Blueline operators have been approaching us requesting us to go easy against permit condition violations. We have told them the action will continue.""

Joint commissioner of police (traffic) Qamar Ahmed said: ""People can see the change already. Drivers are not over-staying at bus stands. Neither are they stopping at places other than bus stops,"" he said.

Joint Action Committee, Delhi Bus Operators, Shyamlal Gola, alleged thatParvinder, who owned two Bluelines, left behind a suicide note blaming the action against his buses for his step.

""The permit of one his bus was suspended for 10 days. He was facing financial problems due to payment of fines,"" said Gola.

12,Excise raid at 19 farmhouses,"NEW DELHI: The excise department of the Delhi government raided 19 farmhouses in Vasant Kunj, in south west Delhi and Narela and Alipur in north west Delhi over the weekend for violating various excise laws.

""Out of these, six farmhouses had violated excise laws. The department will take action against them,"" said Delhi excise commissioner Ranbir Singh.

The farmhouses have been raided following a policy decision taken by the government that farmhouses be allowed to hold commercial parties after requisite permission from the MCD.

Farmhouses have to pay a misuse charge of Rs 40,000 to the MCD and also apply for permission to hold commercial functions.

""After the order, we decided to step up checking of the farmhouses,"" said Singh. ""The MCD has not yet started the permission process, but we were getting reports of commercial functions being held at these farmhouses,"" added Singh. ""The raids were conducted to prevent large-scale violations of the law,"" he said.

Four of the farmhouses raided were serving liqour without requisite permission, while two others had charges of technical violations.

""Two of these farmhouses had taken an L-49(A) licence, that is, permission to serve liqour in a party or function anywhere in Delhi except public parks, under false names,"" said an excise official.

In fact, the raiding party recovered liqour from the neighbouring state of Haryana and also from a defence canteen at one of the farmhouses.

""We have therefore booked these farmhouses for serving smuggled liqour as well,"" said the excise official.

With the notification of Lok Sabha election, the excise department will step up enforcement activities to prevent smuggling of liquor into the city, said Singh. ""We have already started co-ordinating with the police on enforcement drives,"" he said.

13,"Application politics: Fill it, fold it, forget it?","BANGALORE: Parties are going into The Great Indian Huddle - to confer and finalise their lists of candidates for the Lok Sabha and Assembly elections. But how do they crack the code, and net the winners?

The BJP has not huddled much - it bagged ""readymade"" candidates in most constituencies, thanks to floor crossing by members of other parties.

It has also scoffed at the institutional Congress for issuing applications for a fee. Party leader Ananth Kumar dubbed it ""application politics"".

The JD(S) has decided to trust intuition, and spot winners through sheer gut feeling. While the truncated AIPJD awaits a nod from the NDA for an alliance, it has asked aspirants to ""register"" their names at the party office.

The Congress application has turned out to be more mysterious than the huddle - aspirants, especially new entrants, are foxed by some queries, like the one asking the candidate to ""declare"" the number of public meetings organised to highlight the Congress government''s achievements, and the number of members enrolled in the party.

For new entrant Krishna Byre Gowda, seeking a ticket from his late father''s constituency Vemgal in Kolar district, filling out the form was a new experience.

""It was easy striking out columns as ''not applicable'' where one had to give details of criminal investigation or cases pending. But I had to leave the last page blank,"" he said.

But he felt the Congress had made an effort at sending across social messages. ""Some declarations to be given, such as abstaining from vulgar display of wealth, a small family norm are quite relevant,"" he added.

For his senior colleague A B Patil, seeking a Congress ticket itself has been a different experience. As Belgaum district president of his erstwhile party AIPJD, he used to hand over the relevant ''B'' form, but now has to put in an application for himself.

Taking a cue from the Congress, the Janata Party too has come out with an application, albeit with the corporate touch of its chief and business magnate Vijay Mallya.

The Janata Party will collect Rs 5,000 from general candidates and Rs 2,500 from women and SC/STs.

But some queries could stump the candidates, like, ""How much do you intend to spend for these elections? How do you intend to raise the funds, extent of financial assistance expected from the party?""

While the Congress leadership is clear that ""winnability"" is the winning factor, many wonder how seriously the applications will be taken.

""We will go through the replies, but we also have other sources of ascertaining the candidates'' prospects,"" KPCC president B Janardhana Poojary said.

VHP leader Pravin Togadia said, ""There is a fashion in India to blame Hindus, who are victims, for everything and not mention even the names of jehadis who are aggressors...It is unfortunate that roasting 47 Hindus alive on Godhra station is not a blot for Advaniji.""

The bandh call was given in protest against the way the jail administration had terrorised the inmates of the Beur jail while they were protesting against the maladministration in the jail.

What has irked them most was the conspicuous silence of the state government over the brutal attack on the inmates and it''s failure to initiate action against the guilty jail authorities, PW and MCC spokesmen, Prakash and Raman respectively, said in a joint statement.

They stated that now the jail authorities were trying to shift the jail inmates, who are agitating inside the jail.

""Any such attempt would be opposed vehemently,"" they said. The bandh would be observed later and a new date would be announced soon, they added.

""Our efforts would be to throw out politicians like Mohd. Shahabuddin of Siwan, Mahant Yogi Adityanath of Gorakhpur, Mukhtar Ansari and Raja Bhaiya of Uttar Pradesh in coming Lok Sabha polls,"" he said.

""Both Vajpayee and Laloo are responsible for the delay in arrest of the killers of Dubey, Sarita and Mahesh,"" he said. ""Killers of Vajpayee''s nephew were nabbed within a few days of the incident. Similarly, kidnappers of Mulayam Singh Yadav''s grandson were also arrested in a short span of time. But killers of the three are moving scot-free,"" he remarked.

19,Four including two militants killed in J&K,"SRINAGAR: Militants carried out a rocket attack on a Joint Interrogation Centre (JIC) of local police, while four persons including two militants of Jaish-e-Mohammad (JEM) outfit were killed and two others injured in separate incidents in Jammu and Kashmir since Monday night, a police spokesman said on Tuesday.

Militants fired a rocket towards the JIC situated near sector headquarters of Rashtriya Rifles and BSF camp at Khanabal, 50 km from here in Anantnag district of south Kashmir Monday, the spokesman said.

However, the rocket exploded in mid-air after hitting a tree outside the JIC complex causing no damage, he said.

CRPF personnel and local police guarding the JIC fired in retaliation but the militants escaped, sources said suspecting the hand of Hizbul Mujahideen militants in the act.

No militant outfit has so far claimed responsibility for the incident.

He said two JEM militants identified as Basharat of Bhaderwah and Mir Hussain alias Shamsher Khan of Kishtwar were killed in a gunfight with security forces during search operations at Chatroo in Doda district.

Two AK assault rifles, three magazines, seven rounds, four grenades and a wireless set were recovered from the deceased militants, the spokesman said.

The spokesman said unidentified gunmen shot dead a private school teacher Arshid Hussain Khan near his house at Maidan-Chogul in Kupwara district of north Kashmir.

Body of one Mohammad Abdullah Najar was recovered from Gool area of Udhampur district on Tuesday, the spokesman said adding the deceased and his son Basharat were abducted by militants from their house at Janori Dheda village two days back.

The fate of Basharat, still in the captivity of militants, was not known, the spokesman said.

Militants shot at and injured a home guard Mohammad Ashraf Bhat inside his house at Bahan in Kulgam area of Anantnag district, he said.

20,No by-elections for 6 municipal wards,"NEW DELHI: The entire country might be going for elections, but Delhi has no intentions of holding by-elections for six municipal wards, two of which have been without a councillor for two years.

Delhi government and the state election commission will not even couple these with the elections to seven parliamentary constituencies and one by-election for Moti Nagar Assembly seat. Speaking to The Times Of India, chairman of the state election department M P Tyagi said: â€˜â€˜We cannot combine the by-elections. The political parties will be busy with the Lok Sabha poll. After that it will be very hot. We have to look at later dates.â€™â€™

Timarpur, Nand Nagri, Tagore Garden and Nangloi wards fell vacant after the December 2003 Assembly elections when four councillors â€” Ram Babu Sharma, Surinder Singh Bittoo, Dayanand Chandela and Bijendra Kumar â€” got elected as MLAs. Tri Nagar councillor Atma Ram Gupta was murdered in August 2002. Since then his ward does not have an elected representative. The membership of Sharda Jain, who is the prime accused in his murder, was cancelled by MCD and as such Keshavpuram has also lost its councillor.

Municipal secretary Vishnu Swaroop Sharma said: â€˜â€˜As soon as these wards fell vacant, we sent a letter to the authorities. Two wards have been lying vacant for two years and we have been sending reminders, but no date has been set for the elections. No by-elections have taken place even earlier.â€™â€™

Without the elected representatives, the people have to look to administrative staff for help. Sometimes the councillor from the neighbouring ward takes charge. According to MCD, this is an old habit with the state election commission.

21,Govt asks oil firms to tank up for polls,"NEW DELHI: The oil ministry has asked state-owned oil refiners and marketers to tank up with a view to ensuring uninterrupted supplies of petroproducts throughout the country during the general elections.

In a letter to chairmen of oil firms, the ministry has also asked the refiners to put off maintenance shutdowns of refineries until after the elections are over. Demand for petrol, diesel and aviation fuel rise during elections on the back of an increase in the number of vehicles and helicopters used for campaigning. Electoral campaign also raises the average distance travelled by vehicles used by the political parties as these traverse the remotest parts of the country.

The last time the oil companies were asked to tank up was in 2001 when troops were mobilised on the Pakistan border after militants attacked Parliament.

The oil companies had spent about Rs 1,100 crore on maintaining the inventories. But they also made some money as they had bought the stocks when the oil prices were low, which subsequently rose to improve their refining margins.

On an average, the country requires 10 million tonnes of petroproducts every month. The oil companies are to stock crude supplies for 23 days (including 11 days stock in transit), petrol 53 days, diesel 43 days, kerosene 51 days, cooking gas 19 days and jet fuel 88 days. However, the companies across the board have been lowering inventories to reduce operational costs.
