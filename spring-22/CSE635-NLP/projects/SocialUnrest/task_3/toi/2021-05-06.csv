0,Corruption up under Cong rule: Kanwaljit,"PATIALA: Slamming the Amarinder government, SAD (Badal) candidate from the Patiala Kanwaljit Singh said corruption has increased manifold under the Congress regime.

""Earlier money was taken in government offices to get work done, but now people were also being forced to fork it out to the Vigilance department,"" he alleged.

He said the government machinery was being misused to force transporters to supply their vehicles for ferrying people to the venue of rallies addressed by Preneet Kaur. He claimed that in desperation they hired people from Ludhiana and Jalander at the rate of Rs 100 per person to show a good turnout.

Alleging that bogus votes had been prepared by the ruling party, Kanwaljit Singh presented a voter list of booth number 27 of Patiala and claimed that all entries from serial number 246 to 395 were bogus.

Kanwaljit criticised the behaviour of Amarinder and use of derogatory language against political opponents.

Urging the people to vote for him on the basis of his performance as finance minister of Punjab, he sought to woo the Centre government employees, by promising to make all out efforts to get 15 percent house rent for them on the pattern of Punjab.

2,PMC rules on cultural centres opposed,"PUNE: The civic standing committee meeting on Wednesday approved a controversial set of rules framed by the civic administration for renting out its cultural centres and auditoriums, vehement protests from the opposition notwithstanding.

Led by BJP member Vikas Mathkari, the BJP-Sena corporators accused the administration of drafting the rules to favour organisations patronised by Rajya Sabha member Suresh Kalmadi in hiring municipal auditoriums during the prime festival seasons.

As per the rules, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) will have the first claim for hiring these auditoriums for municipal programmes, though other organisations may have applied for the booking in advance.

Similarly, the Maharashtra Tourism Development Corporation (MTDC) will be given the second preference while renting out the auditoriums.

The BJP-Sena members pointed out that the MTDC is a co-sponsorer of the Pune Festival organised by Kalmadi.

Thus, as per the proposed rules, the auditoriums, including the Ganesh Kala Krida Manch (GKKM), Balgandharva Rangmandir and Y.B. Chavan auditorium will always be booked for Pune Festival programmes during the Ganesh festival.

""In the guise of rules, the civic administration has imposed a blanket ban on all other organisations in the city hiring the municipal auditoriums during the Ganesh festival,"" Mathkari said, adding, ""This defeats the basic purpose of framing these rules"".

It may be noted here that the Pune Janotsav committee, headed by minister of state Balasaheb Shivarkar, had moved the Bombay high court in September 2003, challenging the PMCâ€™s decision of rejecting permission to the committee to stage its cultural programmes at the GKKM.

While disposing of this petition, the Bombay high court had directed the PMC to frame a set of rules for renting out the auditoriums so that no such disputes occurred in future.

Civic standing committee chairperson Sangeeta Deokar justified the rules prepared by the administration asking, ""What is wrong in giving the PMC the first preference and a government body which aims at promoting tourism in the state the second preference?""

Interestingly, Shiv Sena corporator Sachin Bhagat too supported the stand taken by Deokar. The controversial proposal was approved with six Congress-NCP members and Bhagat voting in favour and four BJP-Shiv Sena members voting against it.

3,"3 killed, many injured as violence captures booths","NEW DELHI: Bomb blasts, firing and clashes left bloody smudges on Biharâ€™s political landscape as two people were killed and tales of rigging, intimidation and fraud poured in on the last day of voting in the state on Wednesday.

In Jammu and Kashmir, militants trying to keep voters away from polling booths, lobbed grenades at schools and other government buildings used for voting. A bank manager was killed in one such attack in Anantnag town and more than 20 people wounded across the constituency.

Despite tight security in Bihar, RJD supporter Anik Yadav was killed and another critically wounded in an exchange of fire between supporters of two rival parties at Chandwara village of Munger constituency. In Nayagaon village, JD(U) activist M Alam was killed and four others injured when rival Yadav groups clashed.

In Madhepura, where RJD strongman Laloo Prasad Yadav is trying to wrest the seat from JD(U) leader Sharad Yadav, Lalooâ€™s brother-in-law Subhash Yadav was seen moving freely at some booths but disappeared after district returning officer sent officials there following complaints by Sharad.

Polling was cancelled in a booth in Madhepura and 10 people, including a presiding officer and six homeguards, were arrested on charges of bogus voting. EC observer K J Alphonse found that though only 200 voters had signed, more than 300 votes had been cast.

4,Polling amid minor clashes,"JAIPUR: Polling for all 25 Lok Sabha constituencies in Rajasthan passed off more or less peacefully on Wednesday.

However, there were some incidents of violence. One person was injured when BJP and Congress workers clashed near a polling station in Deeg in Bharatpur constituency.

There was also some trouble when supporters of one candidate accused others of wooing voters as they went in to vote in Sinsini. Someone fired a shot, while others smashed an EVM, police said.

Police detained hundreds of people travelling from Gujarat to Barmer and seized their vehicles, fearing a law and order situation. They were released when polling ended. Voting in Barmer was reported to be only 42% until 3 pm, the intense heat was blamed for the low turnout.

Congress has asked for a re-poll in three polling booths in the Rampura area. Congress candidate Rameshwar Dudi said BJP workers had bullied voters and captured booths. In Aadsar and Chimpolai villages in the Loonkaransar area, people boycotted the elections protesting the poor water supply.

5,Spruced up parks reel under rally assault,"KOLKATA: It''s election time and the much-touted beautification of parks has taken a backseat. And, KMC parks department officials can do nothing to stop the damage being done by political parties.

Deshapriya Park has been the worst-hit. The sprawling park ground was badly damaged on Wednesday by a Trinamul rally, which was attended by Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Trinamul chief Mamata Banerjee and mayor Subrata Mukherjee.

Trinamul organised the rally in support of Mamata, who is a Trinamul candidate for the south Kolkata constituency.

Though the mayor had banned rallies inside parks in the city, he, too, joined the damage brigade.

The entire ground was dug up on Wednesday to make way for the bamboo fencing â€” a must for the Prime Minister''s security.The main gate and iron fencing outside was dismantled for the Trinamul supporters who attended the meeting in large numbers.

Also, several saplings that were planted just six months ago were uprooted to make sure that the stage for Vajpayee was proper. The saplings were planted after the KMC authorities undertook a massive demolition drive to free the park of encroachment. A toilet, a club built illegally on the park grounds and a KMC office were demolished to help the beautification drive.

Besides planting saplings, KMC built a pavement all round the park. Further damage is expected when CPM holds a rally on Thursday. Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee will address the gathering.

Congress is scheduled to hold a rally at the Park Circus Maidan on Thursday.

Asked about the misuse by political parties, mayor-incouncil member (parks) Hridayanand Gupta pleaded helplessness. â€œWe were left with no alternative but to grant permission to political parties to hold rallies before the Lok Sabha polls.â€� He, however, promised to enforce the ban immediately after the elections.

7,We will rule: Boldest dream of oldest party,"NEW DELHI: With the third phase of elections for 83 Lok Sabha seats spread across seven states over on Wednesday, with the counting slated for next Thursday, the stakes are as high as hopes.

Swinging high on optimism, nationâ€™s oldest political party dreams the boldest, to script a new story of its return to power after seven years in the waiting. Dismissing all polls â€” opinion and exit â€” the Congress began what would look like a government-making exercise instead.

Ridiculing BJPâ€™s contention that there were divisions in Congress after every electoral defeat in the past, party spokesperson Anand Sharma said that itâ€™s better if NDA save their face.

â€˜â€˜NDA was going to be disintegrated after polls, which will pave the way for a Congress-led â€˜â€˜secular alternativeâ€™â€™ in the 14th Lok Sabha,â€™â€™ he said. He ruled out any alliance with pre-poll NDAâ€™s partners.

â€˜â€˜The BJPâ€™s reverse count is going to begin,â€™â€™ he said.

8,Pakistan protests US-led intrusion,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan on Wednesday said it has lodged a protest with America over an incursion into its territory by US-led coalition troops operating in Afghanistan and demanded an inquiry into the incident.

Pakistan found that the coalition troops â€œintrudedâ€� into North Waziristan area bordering Afghanistan and searched a number of shops before moving back to Afghanistan on Monday evening, foreign office spokesman Masood Khan told reporters here.

Earlier, reports here said that some 60 coalition soldiers in four Humvee trucks intruded two kilometres inside the Pakistani territory in Lwara Mandai Bazaar in Dattakhel tehsil.

Khan said the US government has been asked through diplomatic and military channels to hold inquiry into the border violations and share its details with Pakistan.

9,Latest exit polls may spark market rally,"MUMBAI: The latest exit poll predictions have brought some feel-good back to Dalal Street. On Wednesday evening, as a handful of exit polls after the third round of polling gave the NDA coalition between 263 to 282, brokers and dealers said the leading indices are expected to open with an upward gap on Thursday.

On Wednesday, in a lacklustre session, the Sensex opened higher and remained in a narrow range to finish at 5,686.19, up 39.04 points over the previous close. PSU and banking sector stocks, whose fortunes are closely linked to the government at the Centre, led the pack of gainers.

If the exit polls continue to show a strengthening NDA, these stocks are likely to lead any rally on Thursday, predict punters. â€˜â€˜Although the exit poll results carry some element of uncertainty with them, we feel the market will take the exit poll numbers positively when it opens on Thursday,â€™â€™ Amitabha Chakraborty, head of research, Kotak Securities, said.

Agrees Nandan Chakraborty, head of research at Enam Securities, but with a big caveat. Although investors have started giving a lot of importance to exit poll results, â€˜â€˜these polls have historically been as bad as monsoon forecasts...we still remember what happened during the Gujarat assembly elections in late 2002,â€™â€™ he said. â€˜â€˜I believe a 1% error in the exit polls could swing around 30 seats for the contesting parties,â€™â€™ the Enam research head remarked.

During Gujarat assembly elections in 2002, exit polls and opinion polls had said the Narendra Modi government would lose the elections, but eventually the Modi government got an absolute majority.

Even though polling for 361 of the total 544 Lok Sabha seats is over, market players feel there is time before post-poll scenario becomes clear. But they are sure substantial amount of funds would flow into the equity market in case of a positive mandate for the ruling NDA.

â€˜â€˜In any election, what people look for is stability. At this point, a lot of money is waiting for results and I expect huge inflows in case the actual results lead to a stable government,â€™â€™ Rajiv Sampat, director at Parag Parikh Securities said.

11,Our call centres will be kicking: UK govt,"London: A second coming is forecast for the UKâ€™s huge and lucrative call-centre industry, by the first definitive British bible on off-shoring. And the basic mantra: donâ€™t fear India, the UK beats it on quality if not cost.According to the UK governmentâ€™s first-ever report on the industry (published on Thursday), British call centres will employ four times as many workers as India by 2007.The sector will remain healthy and not sicken and die away because of the Indian plague of â€œlow agent salariesâ€�.Analysts said it may be the first concrete sign that one of the worldâ€™s largest, best-developed call-centre markets was actively being encouraged to create an apartheid-like duality in the trade.The new Department of Trade Industry report says no tears should be shed over the loss of low value work repetitive queries with little flexibility or opportunity on either side. And it significantly insists the UK concentrate on getting and keeping the high value work such as cross-or up-selling, or developing customer relationships.At a high-profile central London industry conference (on Thursday afternoon) to publicise the report, Britainâ€™s trade and industry secretary Patricia Hewitt offered the cheery forecast of one-million British call-centre workers over the next decade.",London
12,Party symbols rule the roost,"NEW DELHI: ""I will vote for the panja. Since the time the kamalhas come to power, prices of essential commodities have gone up and life has become very tough,"" says Munia Devi, 42, mother of three, who works as a household maid in Patparganj in East Delhi. Munia Devi, however, is unaware of the parties that the symbols stand for. She quickly adds, ""But I do know of Indira Gandhi and her sacrifices.""

The appeal of party symbols during elections reaches across a large number of Delhiites, belonging to all strata. Since 1952, when the first parliamentary elections took place, one thing which has remained constant is the party symbols. ""Parties and politicians have made many somersaults and changed hues innumerable times, but not symbols,"" observes Dr Percy Fernandez, a sociologist.

Manish Mishra, a middle-class marketing executive, vows for the kamal. ""The kamal to me symbolises growth with prosperity. Its freshness and fragrance pervades the atmosphere,"" he says. Hidden in such statements, is a strong confirmation of the significance of party symbols, in a country where diversity is the rule of the day.

It is interesting to note the variety of symbols which vary from an axe to an elephant, cycle, rickshaw, scissors, and even gas cylinder. For instance, Dr Basheer Ahmad, an independent from Chandni Chowk, has opted for an aeroplane.

The symbols come in handy while communicating with voters. ""We are often successful in integrating the symbol of the party with the image of Sahib Singhji. They go hand in hand,"" says Krishan Sheoran, who is part of the media cell of the BJP outer Delhi candidate.

For a large number of illiterate voters, symbols assume considerable significance. At times, the two â€” candidate and symbol â€” become synonymous. For many, the blooming of the lotus flower has become a metaphor for a victory for the BJP. At one point, it was Indira Gandhi and the panja that went hand in hand.

Chief electoral officer Arun Goyal says: ""Symbols help in branding the candidates. It also becomes easier to reach the voters through symbols."" Satya Priya Verma, a public relations manager, agrees: ""Co-branding often helps, especially in case of little known candidates."" He adds a word of caution though: ""In cases like Smriti Iraani, where candidate as a brand becomes stronger, the party brand suffers."" Point for BJP brand managers.

Dr Biplove Choudhary, an economist feels, ""In a place like Delhi where there are veterans in all the constituencies, many independent candidates often rely a great deal on their choice of symbols. Astrology may also play a role at times.""

Independent candidates and unrecognised parties have the option of choosing their logo from a list of free symbols offered by the EC. Or they can get creative and suggest one of their own, which may or may not be recognised by the panel.
