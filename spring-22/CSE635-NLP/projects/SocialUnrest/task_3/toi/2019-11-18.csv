0,72 acres of govt land sold through fraudulent deeds in Ludhiana,"LUDHIANA: The district administration has unearthed a land-grabbing scandal in which more than 72 acres of government land was sold through fraudulent sale deeds.

Ludhiana deputy commissioner Anurag Agarwal told mediapersons here on Saturday that in Kuliewal village, which now falls within the Ludhiana MC limits, there is 72 acres 4 kanals and 11 marlas of government land which now forms a part of Swatantra Nagar, Puneet Nagar, Baba Jeevan Singh Nagar and Savan Vihar.

He said that over the years, many people have encroached upon this land and constructed their houses. Many others have simply constructed a plinth to demarcate the land as their own. In some cases, a small room with four inches thick walls and iron/cemented sheets have been built.

Agarwal said that these encroachments were a result of fraudulent sale agreements by some of the land-grabbers with poor people in collusion with some property dealers and government employees.

Explaining the modus operandi of these land-grabbers, Agarwal said that over a period of time the girdawari entries on the government land were changed in their names.

These land-grabbers marked plots of various sizes: 25 sq yards, 50 sq yards, 100 sq yards and so on. Over a period of time, they constructed plinths and boundary walls around these plots.

Then a sale agreement was made with uneducated dailywagers. The payments were made either at the time of agreement or in monthly instalments.

These land-grabbers come every month and if due to some reason the residents are unable to pay their monthly instalments, they are beaten up, said Agarwal.

He said that in the sale agreements, these land-grabbers projected themselves as owners of the land. SDM (East) Bhawna Garg, along with revenue officials, had visited all these sites on September 18. A team of patwaris and kanungos had been constituted to survey the area and make site plans regarding pucca houses illegally constructed on government land, said Agarwal.

""This survey has already been completed. I visited all such sites on Friday and ordered that copies of all such fraudulent sale agreements be collected and FIRs be lodged against the land-grabbers,"" he added.

It is learnt that copies of most such fraudulent sale agreements have been taken into possession by revenue officials.

2,"A month of fasting, and political feasts","NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee has declined to host the mandatory Iftaar this year because he feels the ""breaking fast function"" makes sense only for those who keep the fast. Opposition leader Sonia Gandhi similarly has decided to abstain from hosting the official Congress do in view of Gujarat and the prevailing drought conditions. ""Sensible decision,"" murmurs Maulana Sadiq, a local cleric who makes his living teaching the Quran to the neighbourhood children.

""Ramzan is the month for fasting, not feasting,"" says Sadiq. ""It is a month of piety, simplicity and abstinence, when the ordinary mortal is actually supposed to commune with divinity. This was the month when Allah revealed the Holy Quran to Prophet Mohammed. The lavish Iftaar parties thrown by our politicians are totally against the spirit of Ramzan,"" he says.

Ramzan, which is one of most important months in the Islamic calendar, has been described as ""Allah''s own month"" by Prophet Muhammed. ""O ye who believe! Fasting is prescribed to you that ye may learn self-restraint,"" says the Prophet, thereby laying down the basic theological code for these 30 days: Austerity.

Over the years, however, specially in the political and page three people circles of the Capital, Ramzan has metamorphosed into the ""Muslim party season"" .

For Delhi''s political circuit, Ramzan became just another occasion for realpolitik almost three decades ago. City historians and raconteurs trace the origins of the political Iftaar to the early 1970s when I K Gujral, then a member of Indira Gandhi''s Cabinet, invited Shafi Qureshi, minister of state for railways, for a meal during Ramzan. Qureshi expressed his inability to accept the invitation since he was fasting. Gujral, however, insisted he break the fast at his place and invited a few friends over for an ""early dinner"". Later, the idea appealed to Indira Gandhi who organised the first major prime ministerial Iftaar to express her solidarity with this major minority vote bank.

The political Iftaar, however, was institutionalised in 1977 by H N Bahugana, then minister in Morarji Desai''s Janata Party Cabinet and has ever since been the political barometer that picks out friends and foes in an age of coalition politics.

For the foodie and the fun-lover, Ram-zan in Delhi holds a totally different pro-mise. It means a pre-dawn tryst with steaming, hot nahari (spicy, watery stew made from trotters) and kulcha at Turkman Gate, a dream dinner at dusk of fresh-from-the-skewer seekh kebabs wrapped in roomali roti with paper thin onion rings, followed by nargisi koftas and biryani, scooped straight from the handi at Kutubkhana Azizia, Haji Hotel or the sundry aromatic havens that line the by-lanes about Jama Masjid.

Culturally too, Ramzan is a festive month. It offers music aficionados an opportunity to savour some of the most vibrant forms of qawaalis and Sufi music which are hybrid, homegrown â€” in the alleys of Nizamuddin and purani Dilli â€” and a regular feature after the maghrib prayers, specially on Jum-e-tul-vida (last Friday of Ramzan).

3,'Extinct' mangroves rediscovered in state,"PUNE/KOLHAPUR: In a major breakthrough, a team of botanists and researchers from the Shivaji University SU), Kolhapur, have rediscovered two nationally endangered mangrove species â€” Xylocarpus granatum and Cynometra iripa (commonly known as Valanda and Cynometra) in Sindhudurg and Ratnagiri districts in Maharashtra after 98 years.

The species were first reported by eminent taxonomist Dr. Thomas Cooke in 1901. Subsequently, they were termed extinct and were not reported in the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) report till the team rediscovered it in November 1999. In addition, the team has discovered five other mangrove species â€” Cynometra iripa, Tamarix troupii, Cerbera odullum and Dolichandrone spathacea â€” and reported it to the Union ministry of environment and forests (MoEF). Speaking to The Times Of India, national mangrove scientist Prof. Leela J. Bhosale, head of department Botany) SU, Kolhapur, said the threeyear project (1999-2002) is funded entirely by the MoEF.

â€œThe two species have been reported from the Sunderbans, Bhirtarkanika and Tamil Nadu mangroves in the eastern coast of the country, but never from Maharashtra. Consequently, the scientific community considered it to be extinct from Maharashtra until we rediscovered it and reported to the ministry in 1999,â€� said Bhosale, adding that the discovery has been acknowledged and published in this yearâ€™s Journal of Economic and Taxanomic Botany, India 2002. However, unaware of the discovery, coastal villagers continue to use the species for fuel wood, timber and fencing even today.

â€œSome of the tribal communities and village vaidyas use the oil extracted from the seeds of Valanda for cholera in the form of decoction. Likewise, its bark (tannin) is used to cure stomach-ache and headache,â€� Bhosale said. The SU has been involved in research and documentation works of mangrove ecosystem since 1967 and is recognised as a nodal agency of the state.After the findings, as per the germplasm preservation technique, the team immediately started working on tissue culture of the discovered species.

â€œWe have achieved success till the stage of callus development only in some endangered species like Xylocarpus granatum, Cynometra iripa and Brugueira gymnorrliza,â€� said post doctoral researcher (mangroves) Dr Swagata Banik, now based in Pune. About the human interference in the already dwindling mangrove ecosystem (ME), Bhosale complained that the Maharashtra government has not done anything in this regard.

4,First suicide squad was set up in Pune 2 years ago,"PUNE: Retired lieutenant-colonel Jayant Chitale is not the first Puneite to think of establishing Hindu suicide squads to fight terrorism unleashed by Islamic fundamentalists. The Lashkar-e-Shivba was formed two years ago with similar intentions. It primarily aimed at countering Lashkar-e-Taiba.

While the organisation is in tatters today, its founder and self-proclaimed commander-in-chief Vilas Tupe is bitter about his failed venture. â€˜â€˜My experience of raising Hindu militant squads and sending them to Jammu and Kashmir was so bitter that I would like to forget it,â€™â€™ he said, while speaking to The Times of India. A small-time city builder now, Tupe wishes to forewarn Chitale that his attempt is doomed without money and political patronage.

Incidentally, Tupe is know for attempting to attack Osho Rajneesh with a knife in the 1980s. Tupe says he undertook the attack â€˜â€˜because Rajneesh was a CIA agent.â€™â€™ Talking about his anti-terrorism venture, he said he was inspired to form his outfit after the attack on innocent Amarnath pilgrims in 2000. â€˜â€˜We decided to reach those places from where bullets were being fired against Hindus and give a befitting reply to the terrorists,â€™â€™ he said. While he was planning to counter terrorism in Punjab in a similar manner, then director-general of Punjab police Julieo Ribero had suggested arming villagers and creating Gram Suraksha Dals, Tupe said. â€˜â€˜We went to Punjab, met Ribero and offered ourselves for these Dals.

We even received training for three months at the BSF camps,â€™â€™ he claimed. However, the initiative failed as the Union home secretary objected to it, Tupe said. Tupe said after he announced the forming of Lashkar-e-Shivba, he received an overwhelming response from nearly 2,500 youths from Sangli, Satara, Kolhapur and Ahmednagar districts. Of these, 150 were shortlisted and trained after which â€˜â€˜we left for Jammu to visit terrorist-infested districtsâ€™â€™.

The plan, however, was aborted after a month as we had no money or political support. Meanwhile, Lt Col Chitale, who has established the Hindustan Atma Ghatki Pathak (Hindustan suicide squad) said on Thursday that his squad was not specifically a Hindu squad. â€˜â€˜We are forming Hindustan suicide squads and over 10 per cent of our volunteers are Muslim and Christians,â€™â€™ he claimed.

5,It's lectures for this looker lawyer,"KOLKATA: At 26, Probir Mehta doesnâ€™t exactly fit the stereotyped image of a visiting professor of commercial law. And with his clean matinee idol looks, even he canâ€™t but agree.

Born in New York to expat Indian parents who migrated to the US in the early seventies, Mehta is not exactly unfamiliar to India. So when he wrote to Madhava Menon in May this year offering to come and teach at the National University of Juridical Sciences (NUJS), his offer was promptly accepted. (No wonder he describes Menon as a â€œvisionary and inspirational leader of legal educationâ€�) Mehta is now here in the city to conduct a two- and- a-half month course on commercial law at NUJS. His class of 36 students are from Utkal and Kolkata universities as well as NUJS. Mehta hopes to engage them in â€œconstructive exercisesâ€� to stand up to the challenges and legal problems of the post 2005 WTO scenario. â€œI want our young lawyers to be ready to leverage Indiaâ€™s position vis-a- vis other member countries,â€� he explains with obvious faith in his protegee.

A product of the Michigan University and George Washington university law school, Mehta specialised in international trade and competition law and was thereafter exposed to the hurly burly of the US Congress and courtroom practice with law firm Wilmer, Cutler and Pickering. â€œ It has been a truly enriching experience,â€� gushes Mehta.

â€œ Law students here are bright and inquisitive. Some components of the Indian legal profession are definitely world class - so there is no scope for any diffidence about their ability to able to be compete with the best in the business in a global setting.â€� On his return to the US, Mehta intends to work for a year under a federal judge in Florida. â€œ Itâ€™s a highly legalised society out there - one lawyer for every 32 people. Also court proceedings are time bound, and fast moving- no room for any dilatory tactics.â€� Not that the fresh faced lawyer has any dilatory tactic as far as his other interests are concerned. The pubs and nightclubs in the city, restaurants like Mainland China( â€œthe best Chinese food Iâ€™ve tasted anywhereâ€� ) and badminton have filled up his spare hours â€” sooner than expected.

6,Mamata not averse to ministerial berth,"KOLKATA: Is Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee returning to the Union Cabinet? Before leaving for Delhi on Sunday, she said that Sudheendra Kulkarni, the PMâ€™s special emissary, had contacted her on Saturday regarding a meeting with Atal Behari Vajpayee.

At the Trinamul working committee meeting on Saturday, the Trinamul decided not to sever ties with the NDA but to maintain status quo over railway bifurcation and also occupy the Treasury Bench during the winter session of Parliament starting on Monday. â€œGeorge Fernandes called up, too. These messages are a positive sign that the Centre is ready for talks.

Let us see what transpires at my meetings in Delhi,â€� replied Mamata on whether she would accept a ministerial berth. Party MP Sudip Bandyopadhyay was visibly happy with his leaderâ€™s decision. â€œI have always been in favour of the Trinamul remaining with the NDA. This way, the party will be strengthened,â€� he said. Even the Congress leaders were happy, of course for an entirely different reason. They felt that the decision to return to the NDA would lead to a split in the party. â€œA large number of grassroots workers and lower-level leaders will leave the Trinamul and return to the Congress,â€� claimed Congress leader Pradip Bhattacharyya.

The BJP state unit has also welcomed Mamataâ€™s decision to return to the NDA fold with sources pointing out that the step was taken by Mamata only after party chief Tathagata Roy invited her to an alliance with the BJP. â€œThe hostility between the two parties has ebbed. She has realised that the BJP is serious about its relations with the Trinamul,â€� they added. Yet, allâ€™s not well with the BJP. For the spat between party MP Tapan Sikdar and Roy continued. The two decided to meet in the city on Sunday. This time, Sikdar failed. Why? He was tied down with official work, said Roy. Insiders, however, claimed that this was the MPâ€™s reply to Malda, where Roy did not meet him.

11,No split in BJD parliamentary party: Naveen,"BHUBANESWAR: The Biju Janata Dal president and Orissa Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik, who expelled three of the party MPs on last Saturday, on Monday asserted that there had been no split in BJD parliamentary party in the Lok Sabha.

Patnaik, on his return from Delhi this afternoon, said that he had apprised the Speaker, Manohar Joshi, about the changed scenario following the expulsions.

""We are awaiting his decision. I certainly hope that his decision will go in our favour here,"" he said.

He said the BJDPP, which met in Delhi yesterday, had re-elected Arjun Charan Sethi as its leader. Six BJD MPs had ousted Sethi from the post and elected Prasanna Acharya in his place on September 17.

Patnaik said that the other three MPs from the group of six, did not attend yesterday''s meeting. Now there are seven BJD MPs in the Lok Sabha.

Asked if the election of Sethi as BJDPP leader was democratic, Patnaik said ""I don''t know whether it was democratic for some MPs to quietly take a decision without consulting the party president or other MPs.""

Replying to another question, the BJD chief said that the channels for negotiation were still open for those harbouring differences.

Asked if the party political affairs committee had approved the decision to expel the three MPs, Patnaik said that the new PAC was yet to be constituted.

But in its absence, members of the party''s executive committee had empowered him to take certain decisions, he said.

He ruled out the possibility of the developments affecting the party or the government.

When a reporter pointed out that the rebels had been claiming the support of a sizable chunk of the MLAs and had threatened to oust him from the saddle by end of the current year, Patnaik said that they had been saying that every year. which had no sanction.

12,MCD warns farmhouse owners against misuse,"NEW DELHI: Scores of farmhouses are blatantly indulging in illegal commercial activities, even as the Delhi Municipal Corporation (MCD) fails to check the misuse.

Farmhouse owners using their property for illegal activities like letting them out for banqueting have also carried out constructions flouting norms.

According to MCD surveys, over 850 farmhouses, out of the 2,882 registered with the civic agency, have constructed structures beyond the permissible limit. A bulk of these farmhouses are situated in south and west Delhi and the list does not include hundreds of farmhouses which have come up illegally and do not exist in MCD records.

Increased banqueting in farmhouses during the present wedding season has started taking its toll on the traffic situation in these areas. Now, the MCD has warned farmhouses owners against indulging in commercial activities without valid licence.

According to senior MCD officials, such commercial activities fall under non-conforming use of land as per Master Plan norms, and create traffic congestion, besides causing noise and air pollution.

Commercial activities in farmhouses are banned and violators may invite action under Section 347 and 417 of the Municipal Corporation of Delhi Act.

13,Polls will force govt schools to close down,"AHMEDABAD: First the earthquake, then riots and now elections. For the 2.3 lakh children studying in city municipal schools, education has meant only few days of schooling and months of forced holiday.

Barely a day after schools re-opened on Monday post-Diwali holidays, preceded by six months of riot vacation, it is time to go on election vacation again!

Police authorities have sent a requisition to the municipal schools board to arrange for 31 schools to be vacated for accommodating large battalions of policemen that have started moving into the city to ensure a bloodless assembly election.

And as D-day nears, the demand it is feared, will only increase. ""Co-operating with law enforcers is our duty but if poor students are kept out of schools yet again, when will they cover up for the loss of studies? It will be a big injustice,"" municipal school board chairman Dinesh Raval told TNN.

Raval conceded that policemen have already started moving in and occupied schools in Danilimda and Chamanpura.

Rankled by the prospect of closing school gates to children yet again during elections, the board has urged the police commissioner to kindly spare its buildings, as far as possible. ""Educational activity has been seriously hampered in municipal schools first due to quake and then due to riots where riot-affected and para-military forces occupied sizeable number of our school buildings. Poor children study in our schools.... it would be kind if the authorities make minimum use of buildings during elections for the sake of future of poor children studying in these schools,"" Raval pleaded in a letter written to the city police commissioner and Chief Election Commissioner.

The board is also concerned about sending its 5,000-strong teaching staff for election duties. ""Our exams are scheduled for November 25. If the administration calls the teachers to train for election duties at that time, how will we conduct our exams?,"" wonders Raval.

It needs mention that municipal schools have seen little educational activity when 266 school buildings got damaged in the quake. Over 25 of its buildings remained out of bounds during riots for months even as riot-affected and para-military forces stayed put in the school premises.

Yet another prospect of closing schools for almost a month for elections has raised the hackles of agencies too who have been working hard with the municipal school children.

""Why should poor children always suffer? There are other government buildings too... the Bapunagar General Hospital can accommodate hundreds of people, there is Shram Bhavan.Why is it that municipal schools are always targeted?"", quizzes H Mishra of Kamdar Swasthya Surakha Sangha (KSSS) that works extensively with children in Bapunagar.

Mishra warns that such a careless attitude towards educating the poor will boomerang with most children gradually weaning away from education. ""One should realise that these children and their parents are not very aware... if the schools keep closing its gates for administrative reasons, the children will revert to the streets.""

""We are extremely fearful of the situation and will be planning ways to ensure that children studying in municipal schools are not victimised under the pretext of conducting free and fair poll exercise,"" says Rafi Malik of Centre for Development.

14,How Infosys deal was clinched?,"CHANDIGARH: What made I n f o s y s c h o o s e C h a n d i -garh for setting up its base over the neighbouring areas of Mohali and Panchkula? Apart from a pro-active stance of the team of officials headed by UT administrator Lt General J F R Jacob, the entire deal hinged on the price of the main campus site which Infosys was willing to pay. The UT administratorsâ€™ remarks during the signing of memorandum of understanding with Infosys is an indicator of the intense negotiations between the two parties that were on for a period of over two years. â€˜â€˜The negotiations were tough and both sides worked hard to clinch the issue. In the end you (referring to Infosys associate vice president H R Binod) got whatever you asked for â€˜â€™ Jacob had said. What did Infosys pay? Rs 30 lakh per acre for the entire 20 acre site.

In its notification on allotment of main campus sites to companies in the IT park, the Chandigarh administration had fixed a price of Rs 42.06 lakhs per acre for the players taking up the main sites ( company eligible for a main area site should fulfil conditions like turnover of 500 million US dollars per annum, investments upto Rs 50 crores over the first three years, applicability of a floor area ratio of 0.5 per cent, its rating in the market, capacity to generate employment and export etc.) The notification further says that the conditions â€˜â€˜shall be subject to change from time to time as decided by the Chief Administrator, UT, Chandigarh.â€™â€™ Senior officials say that the payment mechanism for the main campus site is stretched over a period of three years. â€˜â€˜

However, keeping in view the importance of software exports, we have also made a provision that a company achieving an export target of Rs 100 crores will not have to pay the third instalment,â€™â€™ officials say. Since Infosys is an export-driven company it is likley to achieve this target and thus be eligible for a price of Rs 30 lakh. Officials agree that Infosys had been asking for a price matching that of Mohali (Rs 18 lakhs per acre) but finally agreed keeping in view the prevailing land prices and the advantages enjoyed by the company on account of its location in Chandigarh. Talking to Times News Network, UT finance secretary Karan A Singh says,â€˜â€˜ Price was not much of an issue. We had given them an offer around seven months back and there has been no change since that time.â€™â€™ Officials say that Chandigarh was able to clinch the deal also on account of an effective â€˜single window clearance systemâ€™, where the UT finance secretary has multiple charges, with decision making powers in areas where clearances are required by a corporate for setting up operations.
