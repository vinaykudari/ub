0,Poultry farming: A losing proposition,"amritsar: poultry farmers of the state claim to be losing out to competitors from not only adjoining states but also distant states like andhra pradesh. while accusing the state government of being sluggish in coming to their rescue, they hold the imposition of sales tax on birds the major reason for the closure of various units. a delegation amritsar poultry industry association (apia) told the times of india here, on thursday, that the levying of 8.8 per cent sales tax day-old chicken had increased their input costs, enabling competitors from other states to sell broilers and eggs at lower rates in the retail market. jodh singh bhandari, president of apia, said no other state charges such a tax. he claimed that, due to the tax, hatchery owners were now setting up incubation units in neighbouring himachal pradesh and haryana. g s bedi, general secretary of the association said the state government does not generate any significant revenue from the trade but thousands of skilled and semi-skilled labourers have lost their jobs, causing social problems here. he alleged that a major player, having monopoly in the state's poultry market, often creates shortage of dayold chicks to corner huge profits. he suggested that the sales tax be waived to curb the influence of large hatcheries, as also the underhand trade being carried out by small-time hatchery owners, which contributes to the generation of black money. he said a delegation of poultry farmers would soon meet excise and taxation minister adesh partap singh. religious aversion poultry farmers also consider themselves the victims of people's religious beliefs. if sikh militants had tried to impose their agenda of vegetarianism during the period of extremism, the muslim-dominated markets, such as kashmir, have now been captured by competitors from other states. one farmer rued, ''there are 52 tuesdays and as many thursdays, masya, sangrands and puranmasisnumber 12 each. add to these, 18 navratras and about 15 shradhsand you have precious few days when people do not abstain from meat and eggs.

1,BJP morally incoherent: Congress,"bathinda: to protest the reinduction of george fernandes defence minister, especially in view of the tehelka expose, districtlevel congress units organised protest rallies at different places in the area. charging the bjp-led alliance of being ''morally incoherent'', congress leaders severely criticised the union government for letting tainted and corrupt political leaders into the cabinet. congress leaders said that fernandes had gone against his own claim that he would ''return only after being vindicated by venkataswamy commission'', which is probing the tehelka expose. though the leaders attacked punjab chief minister parkash singh badal for ''misusing religion'', local issues dominated the protest dharna and rallies, which were staged in front of the deputy commissioner's office. the congress charged the cm of draining out at least rs 20 crore from the public exchequer, for the september 25 killianwali rally''. the congress said that the cm had wasted public money on a departed leader who had denied punjab its share of water.

2,State govt monitors sonography clinics,"pune: the state government seems to have woken up at last to the need to curb the heinous practice of female foeticide, which is usually based on pre-natal sex-determination tests. it has constituted district, regional and state level monitoring committees to keep a watch on the activities of sonography clinics. dr p.v. bhatlawande, additional director (health services), said this was being done following an alarming decline in the sex ratio in the state. there is also a supreme court directive asking state governments to effectively implement the prenatal diagnostic test act. dr bhatlawande was speaking at a two-day state-level seminar on 'national population policy: challenges and choices' organised by the community aid sponsorship programme (casp), here on thursday. dr bhatlawande quoted figures that showed that the total fertility rate (tfr) in the state had gone down from 4.4 per cent in 1975, to 2.7 per cent. the government planned to reduce it further to 2.1 by 2004 and 1.8 by year 2010. however, the state needed to reduce the sheer number of daily births. explaining this he said that between 1951 and 1961, there were 2,100 new births every day, but the number had risen to 4,400 new births every day, between 1981 and 1991. speaking on the contraception scenario dr anant sathe of the family planning association of india (fpai) lamented the delay in the introduction of the adolescence-education programme in high schools. the programme covers topics like gender equality, responsible and planned parenthood and aids. he said that although the idea was to 'catch them young', it would be five years before the course was introduced across the country. dr sathe said that currently only 22 per cent adolescents in the country were found to have some knowledge of these vital issues. carol squire, country director, population service international, said that as compared to other south asian countries, indians did not have much choice regarding contraceptives. fewer spacing methods were available and the choice was foisted on women. contraceptives were not easily available either, she added. ms squire suggested that couples should discuss family planning before going in for their first child, and get all possible information regarding the various options available. india should aim at introducing at least three spacing methods that were easily accessible to people. dr banoo coyaji, chairperson, kem hospital, was very critical of activists who have been opposing injectible contraceptives. she said that they ""created misconceptions"" about injectible contraceptives, which has hampered the family planning programme in the country. ""who gave these activists the right to make a choice for millions of women?"" she asked. gynaecologist dr vaijayanti khanvilkar and director of casp dr sharadchandra gokhale were among the other speakers at the meet.

3,Rain spells trouble for chilli farmers,"bellary: after a long spell of drought, farmers in bellary welcomed the rain as it would save their rabi crops. but rain has got one segment of the farmers worrying. those who have cultivated chilli crop are wondering whether this year also, like last year, they will lose their crop. last year, farmers lost their chilli crop to the muruda pests which struck just before harvest. this year everything was going fine till september-end. but with heavy rain in october, the crop cultivated on about 10,000 hectares, particularly in bellary and siruguppa taluks was damaged due to rain water stagnating in the fields. according to agriculturists, stagnant water affected root respiration resulting in the plants withering away. losses are estimated to touch rs 15 crore. farmers who managed to save their crop had gone in for sowing before july. in fact, experts had warned of distress in chilli cultivation. with rain still active in the district, the ideal crops are bengal gram, wheat, sunflower or coriander. heavy rain had the fields logged in water and the farmers had to necessarily drain out the water to protect crops and regularly deweed the area. the safe alternative for cultivation is bengal gram, but the government is not in a position to meet the demand for seeds by farmers. while the demand is for 5,000 quintals, the karnataka state seeds corporation has so far been able to supply only 1000 quintals, say sources. in siruguppa, cotton crop is being destroyed by pests, likewise the groundnut crop in kudligi taluk. h.narayana reddy, joint director suggested spraying of pesticides to save crops. reddy also suggested that farmers insure their crops.

4,Hyd-Karnataka activists dig in heels over bandh,"gulbarga: ignoring the appeals of two senior ministers to drop the demand for a separate state, the hyderabad-karnataka region development action commitee on friday pressed on and called for a total bandh on november 1. the committee chairman and former state minister vyjanath patil told reporters, the bandh would be observed in all five districts in the hyderabad-karnataka region. he said, the region was neglected in terms of development at all levels. he added, a glaring example of such neglect was the announcement of a list of 630 high school teachers for the region in which only 100 candidates had been drawn from hyderabad-karnataka. ``there is discrimination while recruiting doctors and dentists'', he said. ``the karnataka government has little respect for people's demands'', he added. patil said if senior ministers of the region, home minister mallikarjuna kharge and public works minister dharam singh had any concern for the people, they should apply pressure and stall the teachers' recruitment list. he also urged ministers to spell out a definite programme for eradicating the regional imbalance. patil was sceptical about their programmes and asked them to be clear in their views. patil said a meeting was held in the city and two other meetings would be held in bidar and raichur districts on october 22 and 23 respectively. he said, the bandh was one of the several agitational programmes the committee had framed and added, it had received good response at all levels. ``the samata party has extended support for the proposed bandh''. patil alleged, the karnataka chief minister s.m.krishna who had earlier ordered that preference be given to local candidates for employment in upper krishna project (ukp) (when he was deputy chief minister and finance minister in the previous congress-led government) had gone back on his word.

5,Congress to oppose anti-terrorism law,"new delhi: barely 24 hours after it took an ambivalent view on the new ordinance promulgated by the government to combat terrorism, the congress changed tack, announcing that it will ""oppose the proposed law tooth and nail"". this means the nda government will not be able to get the prevention of terrorism bill passed in the rajya sabha where the opposition parties enjoy a majority. on wednesday, the party spokesperson said the congress recognised the need for the law but objected to the manner in which it had been brought in through an ordinance. on thursday, the congress sought to make amends for its wishy-washy approach, saying it had decided to oppose the proposed law. congress sources said the party took a conscious decision to abandon its overly-cautious approach in view of the bjp's deliberate attempts to fuel communal passions in up, which is headed for assembly elections. the congress, it was stated, took note of the recent developments in agra where bjp youth activists defaced the taj mahal, followed by the storming of the babri-ram janambhoomi disputed site by vhp leaders at ayodhya. the party's unequivocal stand on the anti-terrorism law also stems from the realisation that an ambivalent approach - whether on the simi ban or the us attacks on afghanistan - will not help fetch it any electoral dividends in up. the congress had been doing a tightrope walk on sensitive issues as it did not wish to displease the minorities and, at the same time, wanted to woo the hindu upper castes. congress spokesperson jaipal reddy said thursday that the proposed anti-terrorism law contained several draconian provisions which were not part of the defunct tada, adding that tada itself had bred inefficiency and corruption and done incalculable harm to lots of innocent lives. the proposed law, he said, was not amenable to bail applications and had reversed the principle of jurisprudence as it had shifted the burden of proof to the accused.

6,Punjab faces another religio-political crisis,"chandigarh: the recent incidents of burning of the guru granth sahib birs have prepared the ground for a prolonged battle between the ruling akali dal and the panthic morcha, with the congress painting both of them as villains. and senior government officials fear that the panthic morcha's attempt to revive radical feelings by recalling the days of jarnail singh bhindranwale and the sikh-nirankari clashes might not augur well for the state, which has barely recovered from the decade-long militancy. the root of the problem is piara singh, a former class iv employee of the punjab horticulture department, who a decade ago decided to ""arrogate to himself divine powers to get into the mould of the sikh gurus"". he gave up his job and set up a dera near dhamia village in ropar district under the patronage of former union minister buta singh. thereafter, piara singh started weaving stories about his ""miraculous powers"" and eventually compiled ""anecdotes from his personal life"" in a book called bhavsagar samundar amarvani granth sahib. though the controversial granth assumed its final form in april this year, the baba had been in the eye of the storm for the past four years. he had started wearing kalgi (plume) and riding a horse, claiming himself to be an incarnation of guru gobind singh. as the matter was brought to the akal takht's notice, the then jathedar ranjit singh ex-communicated the baba from the sikh panth (community) in 1998. however, not only his followers, but many political leaders as well ignored the hukamnaama. they included akali dal leaders like agriculture minister gurdev singh badal, his son, kewal singh badal, who is vice-president of the sgpc, congress leader of the opposition in the vidhan sabha chaudhary jagjit singh and a number of police and administrative officials. in july this year, when the controversial baba started asking his followers to accord more respect to his granth than what they would give to the guru granth sahib, the jathedar again asked sikhs to break ties with the baba. last month, when members of the sikh students federation (mehta faction) set a copy of the baba's granth afire, his followers retaliated in ratangarh village by burning the copy of guru granth sahib. as the matter flared up, the police swooped on the baba's dera and arrested him a few days later, while his followers kept indulging in acts of desecration by burning guru granth sahib birs. former jathedar ranjit singh, who was convicted for the assassination of nirankari chief gurbachan singh, has now sought to draw a parallel between the present controversy and the one that had led to the sikh-nirankari clashes. joining him, akali dal (amritsar) president simranjit singh mann minced no words in reminding the congregation about bhindranwale. ""had he been around, such incidents (burning of birs) would not have occurred,"" he said. though mann has denied having written any letter expressing gratitude to baba for extending him support in the 1999 lok sabha election, which mann contested from the sangrur constituency, his party's chief spokesman i.s. tiwana has admitted to the authenticity of the letter. the ruling akali dal is likely to request the akal takht jathedar to take note of this and summon mann for an explanation thereby deflating the aggressive posture of the panthic morcha against the badal government. in their attempt to put the morcha and the congress in the dock, the akali leaders may also request the jathedar to summon buta singh and former sgpc president gurcharan singh tohra for their association with the baba.
