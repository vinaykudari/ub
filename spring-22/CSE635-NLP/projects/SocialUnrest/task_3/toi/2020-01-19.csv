0,"Rs 10,000 cr Central investment in Kerala","KOCHI: Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee on Saturday announced a Rs 10,000 crore investment in public sector units in Kochi.

Addressing a gathering after inaugurating the Global Investor Meet (GIM) here, Vajpayee expressed surprise over the slow rate of economic growth in Kerala, considering its vast natural and human resources.

He asked the ""versatile Malayali to unload the historical burden of outdated dogmas, sterile ideological debates, and skewed view of looking at capital as something evil"".

However, in recent times, Kerala had shown signs of economic revival by ushering in a series of reforms, said Vajpayee, adding that the Centre was willing to contribute in this regard.

He said the economic reforms initiated by the Centre were not an aberration, but a long-considered strategy for achieving growth. The reforms were aimed at achieving basic goals like full employment and gender equality, besides eradication of poverty.

""The path of economic reforms we have embarked on is not a matter of short-term expediency. It is the outcome of a well-thought out way of tapping our resources and talent to realise our goal of better life for the masses.""

""Let there be no doubt that our objectives continue to be removal of poverty, employment generation, environmental protection and social-gender justice. The key to all this is to enhance the productivity and competitiveness to global standards. For this, it is necessary to create a climate conducive for investment,"" said Vajpayee.

The PM called upon both domestic and foreign investors to ""partner with the Centre to create a more prosperous, vibrant and equitable India.""

""I see a sense of urgency among people across the country to achieve a balanced growth. It is now for the political and governing bodies to reflect this sense of urgency,"" said Vajpayee.

1,Remove Dhumal hoardings: EC orders HP govt,"SHIMLA: The Election Commission has ordered the state government to remove all hoardings that have been put up in various parts of the state proclaiming the achievements of the Dhumal govermment during its five-year term.

Election department sources here confirmed that they had received a copy of the letter sent to the state government from the EC. Criticising the EC order asking the state government to remove the hoardings, BJP leaders said it was playing the Congress game. ""Why should a simple thing as a hoarding, which is neither provocative nor slanderous against anyone, and is just informing the masses of what works have been done in the state, be removed,"" they asked.

However, Congressmen welcomed the order. ""How could government expenses incurred on the hoardings be justified in the poll expenses, for basically they had been put up with the February 26 assembly elections in mind,""they claimed.

An official spokesman said directions had been issued to all deputy commissioners to remove the hoardings in compliance with the EC directive.

During the recent visit of the Chief Election Commissioner J M Lyngdoh and the other two election commissioners to the state, a Congress delegation had met them and requested that the hoardings be removed.

Lyngdoh had hinted at the things to come when he said that during Gujarat elections, the EC had ordered the removal of the hoardings, as it felt that such hoardings could not come under the normal expenditure limit.

2,"Sporadic protests by anti-GIM groups, bus partly burnt","THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: A state bus was partly burnt in Aluva as anti-Global Investor Meet protestors of ultra left groups took to the streets in parts of the state on the opening day of the two-day investment promotion event organized by the UDF Government in Kochi on Saturday.

The police had taken into preventive custody about 300 anti-GIM activists since Friday evening and stepped up security in Kochi, the venue of the meet, opened by Prime Minister A B Vajpayee, and other towns across the state.

A KSRTC bus was partly burnt by suspected Ayyankali Pada activists at Karottukuzhi near Aluva in Ernakulam district. No one was injured and the miscreants ran away from the scene after damaging the bus, police said. Another bus was stoned in Kuruppampadi in Ernakulam.

The police stalled anti-GIM marches taken out from near the Maharajas Colleges and Vaittila in Kochi.

In Thiruvananthapuram, eight ""Quit Kerala"" activists, including a woman, arrested last evening for demonstrating before the government secretariat, were remanded to judicial custody by the first class judicial magistrate on Saturday.

3,"Raid okay, but did police want to arrest him?","LUCKNOW: It was a godsend opportunity for the state government and BJP MLC Ajit Singh, a prominent dissident leader, offered it by default. Even then, the government gave a ''go ahead'' to go all out against the mafia-turned-politician after much deliberations. The political heads were of the view that as Ajit Singh was one of the spearheads of dissident movement in the state in the recent past and as everything was calm on that frot now, any stringent action against him was likely to rake up the issue once again, atleast in the media.

Another important factor which influenced the political leadership in the state in taking the final decision against Ajit was the fact that on the day of the incident, the MLC had gone to attend the Tilak ceremony of the brother of Unnao Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) MLA itself. The fact that this particular element would highlight the proximity of some BSP MLAs with the dissidents, had led to initial reluctance on the part of the BSP think-tanks which were at work since Friday night itself.

Finally, at the behest of chief minister Mayawati, it was decided that action against Ajit Singh must be initiated. But by the time the decision was taken, the MLC had enough time to ''slip away'' â€” thanks to the valuable tip-offs from his contacts in the Unnao police department. No wonder then when police raided the house of the MLC in Charbagh around 8:00 pm nothing worthwhile was found.

Though the MLC''s wife was unwell, his father was the only male member of the family present in the house at the time of the raid which was more of a make-up exercise. The fact that the Unnao police took more than 12 hours before going for a crackdown gave ample time to the MLC to go underground.

With the charges levelled against the MLC limited to the extent of ""attempted murder"" and the victim suffering a bruise on his head were all in favour of Ajit Singh in terms of pursuing an arrest stay. This apart, the fact that the enmity between Ajit and Akhilesh is well known and both have had quite a few exchange of fires in the recent past, was also sure to provide some leverage to him in the investigations.

All said and done, the police raid at the Charbagh residence of Ajit seems to be more of an eye-wash and a potent pressure tactic of the government to ensure that the high profile MLC maintained a low profile at the political front than a strong-willed effort to arrest him for the alleged crime.

5,BJP alerts cadres in Cong-ruled states,"NEW DELHI: The BJP on Saturday alerted its cadres in all Congress-ruled states to be wary of being ""blamed and defamed"" for any communal violence in those states as this was a tactic of that party to win the support of minorities by ""terrorising them.""

""We have alerted our party cadres in the Congress-ruled states to be wary of the Congress party fomenting communal trouble and defaming the BJP for it as a move to get the support of minorities,"" party spokesman Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi told reporters here.

He said this would be one of the main items of the agenda of the meeting on Monday of state Presidents of Madhya Pradesh, Delhi, Rajasthan and Chattisgarh with the Central leadership.

""Congress-ruled states are trying to communalise the atmosphere in these states so as to get the votes of minorities. There were the recent riots in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Maharasthra and the Congress supported RJD-ruled Bihar,"" he said.

With the Congress ruled states failing on fronts and there being no developmental work undertaken, these government were ""now wanting to foment communal violence to get votes,"" Naqvi said.

Hitting out at the move by the Congress-PDP government in Jammu and Kashmir for releasing terrorists without proper verification of their antecedents, he said, ""This was not in the interest of the state or the nation.""

He said this type of measures would only encourage terrorism and embolden them to continue with their activities specially like threatening women for not wearing burqas and persons belonging to a particular community.

6,Assocham asks govt to reduce import duty on crude palm oil,"NEW DELHI: Assocham on Sunday asked the government to reduce import duty for crude palm oil to 25 per cent from the current 65 per cent as high duty for a product used as a raw material was an anomaly which needed to be corrected.

""The duty provision of 65 per cent on raw material used by the vansapati industry against 30 per cent for the finished imported product was an anomaly and needs to be rationalised,"" Associated Chamber of Commerce and Industry (Assocham) said in a statement here.

Pointing the customs duty had drastically reduced the industry''s capacity of competing with the cheap vanaspati coming from Nepal, it noted domestic industry had to absorb higher customs duty of 65 per cent while the Nepalese manufacturers did not have to pay any duty for the same oil, giving them a cost advantage of Rs 10,000 per tonne.

The chamber said the government should also restrict the import of crude palm oil to the vanaspati industry against actual user provision to check any malpractice and asked it to withdraw the permission given to refiners and traders as they were not equipped to process it hygienically and hydrogenate it.

Describing the increase in import duty of crude palm oil as a retrograde step, the Chamber said the annual growth rate of the industry was not keeping pace with the rise in demand due to increase in population and higher disposable income with the consumers.

7,"J&K minister Beig, militants' new target","SRINAGAR: With the J&K ready to start talks with Centre, militants have trained their guns on the two key people in the state - chief minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed and the state finance minister Muzaffar Hussain Beig.

The logic is simple - if the militants succeed, the ""healing touch"" plans go for a six. Governance issues will go on the backburner and fear psychosis will grip the state again.

The decision to assassinate the two was reportedly taken two weeks ago during a meeting of the Lashkar-e-Taiba at Muzaffarabad, in Pakistan occupied Kashmir. A price of Rs 50 lakh was placed on the head of the chief minister. Rs 40 lakh was the prize declared for Beig.

Mufti seems an obvious target. But the choice of Beig is even more simple.

A Harvard law school graduate, Beig was an extremely successful Supreme Court lawyer.

The former advocate-general of J&K now holds several key portfolios in the Mufti government - planning, finance, law and parliamentary affairs. He was also pivotal in cobbling together the coalition with Congress and giving shape to the cabinet. Since he joined the Mufti government last November, Beig has been threatened thrice.

Beig recalled getting the first threatening phone call when he had gone to pay condolences to the family of slain law minister Ghulam Mohi-ud-din Lone in Lolab.

""I was told to desist from visiting the Lone family, whom they described as traitors,"" said Beig.

The second threat came when Beig started looking into the problems of the people - visiting hospitals and educational institutions and other public places. The minister was asked to start counting the days of his life.

It was obvious, said Beig, that the militants did not want anyone to mitigate the woes of the people.

The third time, Beig received a long distance call at his Jammu government residence.

The caller warned him of dire consequences for being too active a minister.

The pro-people policies of the new government are proving to be a problem for the militants, said Beig. They want the state and the people to suffer, and hence the bid to derail every move aimed at the betterment of the people, he added.

""But I assure you that even if I face a threat to my life, I would go on... we cannot afford to remain mute spectators to what is going on around us,"" he said.

Beig has also reportedly taken on the sluggish bureaucracy.

Hypocrisy and lobbying will not be tolerated in the state administration, he is quoted as having said. Government officials need to work to mitigate the problems of the people.
