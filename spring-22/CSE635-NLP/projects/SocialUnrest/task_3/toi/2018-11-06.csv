7,Schoolchildren form human chain to protest corruption,"patna: around 8,700 students from 30 government schools of patna assembled in gandhi maidan on monday. later, they formed a human chain from the statue of mahatama gandhi to jp roundabout covering entire gandhi maidan to create awareness about corruption in society. in fact, they were invited by patna district administration to participate in various competitions, including quiz, painting, flower making, slogan writing, cartoon drawing and poster making. school boys and girls have a unique conception about corruption prevailing in the society. asked about her first introduction to corruption, shalini, a girl-student of class viii in m g high school, east boring canal road, patna, recalled that she was once taken to civil court on way to her school by her uncle a few years ago. according to her, that day she personally saw her uncle giving bribe to a court clerk in patna. alpana, a ix class student of patna central school said her father avoided her admission in bihar-government schools because of corruption prevailing in the bihar school examination board. huma ali khan from the same school said whole society is in the grip of corruption and one could easily encounter it in any police station. ""it is also a corruption to get admitted in a good school by paying donations,"" said anita, a ix class student of ram lakhan singh yadav school, punaichak. some other students explained corruption in different ways. according to abhishek chandra, an eighth class student of st xavier's school, the recent attack on world trade centre in america was also a part of corruption. he justified his statement saying that terrorism had its root in corrupt minds. puja, a ninth class student of ram lakhan singh yadav school, said even murders were being committed because of prevailing corruption. most students picked up the police department to give examples regarding incidence of corruption. the patna district administration had also placed ""community graffiti"" for visitors to express their views on checking corruption. ""corruption is that parasite which feeds on the country from inside and makes it hollow,"" wrote badal kumar, a class ix student of patna collegiate school. another message written by afghan aalam said ""corruption is terrorism, eradicate corruption, and make india the land of gandhi once again."" prakash, a student of shaheed rajendra prasad high school, in one cartoon, has shown a cage of corruption in which entire society is locked. jury members included cartoonist nirad, designer and painter ronny banerjee, painter archana, gopal prasad and ajay verma, both vigilance department officials.

8,Conference on genetically modified crops,"new delhi: amid the controversy on genetically-modified bt cotton, the indian society of genetics and plant breeding is set to hold a four-day conference to discuss future challenges while farmers' groups led by former minister balram jakhar blamed the government on monday for not exercising enough caution on gm crops. addressing a news conference on monday, the genetics society's h k jain and mangala rai spoke of the potentially rich dividends, bracing themselves for challenges such as the need for a higher yield per unit of land, water, energy and time. scientists will have to develop plant varieties resistant to drought, salinity and diseases to increase the rate of food production to keep up with an increasing population. there was a need to take advantage of newer biological techniques such as molecular biology and biotechnology which permit identification and transfer of specific traits ""in a precise and verifiable manner"". all this will come up in the society's diamond jubilee symposium on ""hundred years of post-mendelian genetics and plant breeding — retrospect and prospects"", starting tuesday. rai, who is deputy director-general (crop sciences) in the indian council of agricultural research, says icar has done limited work in transgenic crops such as cotton, eggplant, tomato and rice. refusing to be drawn into the unauthorisedly-grown bt cotton controversy, he said each country has a procedure for risk assessment and release. ""if you are going to test,"" he added, ""you have to follow the procedure; tomorrow, such a problem could come under litigation."" icar's role, however, is limited. in sanctioned large-scale trials of bt cotton by the maharashtra hybrid seed company, icar is monitoring merely nine of more than 400 locations countrywide, and that too on just one aspect — commercial cultivation. studies on possible impact on the environment, and human and animal health have not been completed, said rai. bt cotton is grown in countries such as the us, china and australia but scientists here insist transgenics need to be evaluated in indian conditions. there is a need, they concede, to differentiate between what is likely to be more, and less, harmful. there is also a need to invest in ""first-rate human resources"" in the frontier areas of biotechnology. but evaluation is a must. in a very different forum, jakhar, vandana shiva of navdanya and other farmers' groups blamed the government and a multinational for ""illegally testing"" bt cotton seed here and ""not preventing its illegal dissemination"". there is no evidence of this, however. they decided to set up a committee of independent experts to inquire into what has happened and the dangers involved.they don't oppose scientific advances but object to ""profit-oriented organisations"" being allowed to deal with safety provisions ""in an irresponsible manner"".

9,Debate on Karnataka law,"bangalore: apprehensions expressed over the centre's prevention of terrorism ordinance (poto) have made the opposition parties in karnataka chary of a similar legislation enacted recently. the karnataka control of organised crime (kcoc) bill, 2000, passed in the last legislative session, is awaiting the president's assent. during the bill's passage, the principal opposition parties, the bjp and the janata dal's both factions, had cautioned the government against its misuse. chief minister s.m. krishna on monday, however, declined to comment either on poto or kcoc. a public debate on the ordinance is currently on and karnataka's legislation is pending before the president, he told reporters. the congress central leadership, which has been critical about poto, is caught in a tight spot with its own party governments in karnataka and maharashtra having enacted similar legislations. speaking to times news network here, jd (u) leader and former home minister p.g.r. sindhia said both poto and kcoc were not required. if the legislations become acts, they would be misused by the respective ruling parties, he contended.

10,Congress in a bind over terror law,"new delhi: with the bjp raising the pitch on the prevention of terrorism ordinance (poto), congress leaders unofficially admit that their opposition to the bill, that replaces tada, has been blunted by the fact that the states they rule have similar laws. while maharashtra and assam have enacted special laws to deal with terrorism, karnataka has sent a poto-like ordinance to the president for approval. senior congress leaders admitted this was the party's weak point, and said the party would need to gear up to fight the bjp when poto comes up before parliament in the winter session. asked about this, party spokesperson jaipal reddy was defensive but said he would examine the states' bills and see if they really contained draconian clauses of poto. the government was bringing in poto with ""highly partisan and deeply political motives"" with an eye on the up elections, he claimed. the bjp has already accused the congress of adopting double standards and asked it to explain its opposition to the bill when the states ruled by it have similar laws. in fact, the bjp has decided to make poto a major electoral issue in the coming assembly polls and will launch a campaign against those opposing it, dubbing them as anti-national. home minister advani has gone to the extent of saying that those opposing poto are appeasing terrorists. within the congress too there are some murmurs of dissent. its leaders from maharashtra and karnataka say they need special laws to deal with terrorism and the underworld since existing laws have proved inadequate. there are also some who think poto is not as severe as tada and, in fact, has several safeguards. a senior leader from maharashtra said the special law had actually proved quite effective in tackling terrorism. karnataka chief minister s m krishna, whose government has forwarded a poto-like ordinance for presidential assent, also has favoured the new law. krishna, who met congress president sonia gandhi last week, told presspersons that karnataka needs this law to deal with the underworld, which is spreading its tentacles from maharashtra. congress cadres, especially from up, fear if the bjp succeeds in its campaign to paint poto opponents as pro-terrorists and anti-nationals, it could turn the tables on the congress in the state assembly polls. the bjp gameplan is to consolidate its hindu votebank while the congress is hoping to cash in on the people's disenchantment with the rajnath singh ministry's poor governance.

11,Work-to-rule stir forces varsity to postpone exams,"mumbai: it was testing times for hundreds of students on monday when mumbai university postponed as many as seven examinations owing to a work-to-rule agitation called by its non-teaching staff. the mumbai university employees' union is on an indefinite work- to-rule stir, asking varsity officials to meet its charter of demands. the union has said that till its demands are met, its members will not do any overtime work—a move that will affect the conduct of many varsity exams. we will work only from 10.15 a.m. to 6 p.m, our specified working hours,'' union president v.d. niphadkar told this newspaper. the stir has affected examinations as employees have to work overtime to distribute question papers to the various exam centres. altogether, 21 exams were to be held today, but seven had to be postponed due to the stir,'' vicechancellor b.l. mungekar told this newspaper. these included the ninth semester architecture exam, exams in audio and speak therapy course, masters in social work, third year b.sc. nautical science, first year b.sc and m.sc home science and first and third b.pharm. while only a handful of students were to appear for some of the exams, 300-odd students were to appear for the ninth semester architecture exam. meanwhile, the union claims that if students have to suffer, it is only because of varsity officials. we had made a list of 25 demands to the university. among other things, we had asked that kin of deceased employees should be inducted into the university and that pension should be paid to employees who had not obtained it so far, even though they had retired in 1995,'' mr niphadkar said. the union had also demanded a food allowance, he said, adding that the management council had accepted these demands. even then, the varsity has not heeded to our requests. the vicechancellor kept telling us that there were no funds forthcoming from the government,'' said mr niphadkar. the union had, therefore, decided to embark on a workto-rule stir, he added. explaining how the stir had affected the conduct of exams, union members said that most exams started around 10 a.m. our work starts only at 10.15 a.m., so there is no way question papers can reach the centres before the exam starts,'' a union member said. in the meantime, mumbai university officials have a different story to tell. the union had given us a charter of demands and we held discussions with them in july,'' mr mungekar told this newspaper. many of the demands were of a financial nature'' and the varsity had, in fact, accepted these demands though it meant incurring an annual expenditure of rs 12 lakh, he said. it went against the government measures to cut costs, but with the idea of ensuring the co-operation of university employees, we agreed to their demands,'' he added. while thrashing out an agreement, it was mutually decided that a memorandum of understanding to this effect would be signed between the union and the varsity, also stating that the deal would stand for another four years. it was to be implemented with effect from august 1 this year. the proposal was cleared by the finance and accounts committee and later by the management council. but the mou took some time to be drafted and, in the meanwhile, the union served us with a work-to-rule notice on october 25. they also went back on the four- year clause in the agreement,'' mr mungekar said. negotiations are currently being held with union members to resolve the issue, said mr mungekar. he added that examination work was compulsory under a government ordinance, and that non-teaching staff could not shy away from it.

14,Dalit conversions have roots in UP politics,"new delhi: there is more to sunday's dalit conversions in new delhi than tonsured heads and a new religion. it is a heady mix of age-old alienation, intra-caste equations and uttar pradesh politics, say political and social observers. the newly christened udit raj, the dalit leader who has recently shot into prominence, is, of course, quick to disown any political ambitions. "" i do not have any political ambitions... but, dalit politicians (read the bsp) are afraid of me"", he says. the dalit leader and income tax joint commissioner, who was ram raj till he converted to buddhism on sunday, is fuming that the much-touted biggest congregation at ambedkar bhavan of ""one million dalits"" turned into a gathering of only a few thousands. ""my supporters were not allowed to enter delhi for the mass-conversion"", raj says to justify the lesser numbers. for a man who professes to have no political interests or ambitions, raj's harangue is pointed. ""it was an undeclared emergency. people were stopped at delhi's borders. this was the handiwork of mayawati and the bsp, who colluded with the government to foil our programme"", he thunders. raj complains, ""the bahujan samaj party is based on ambedkarism. and yet, they have not even decried the denial of our rights by the government. the congress has called it a 'murder of democracy', the left has condemned it. but not a word from the bsp."" ""there are 4 million indirect members in my confederation of sc/st organisation"", he says. going by this projection, his support base would, therefore, constitute 40 lakh ""neutral"" dalits with no political leanings for the moment; a huge vote-bank that raj insists will not support anyone politically. seen in the context of the forthcoming uttar pradesh elections, the presence of a huge vote bank like this one could tilt the political sweepstakes in a given direction at any point of time. for the moment, raj is not mincing words - especially when it comes to describing the bsp hierarchy as ""scheming dalit leaders"". and, he is predicting an yet another bsp-bjp alliance post elections. ""there is already an internal pact in place"", he declares resolutely. sociologists see a political reason for raj's pet peeve. professor j.s. gandhi of jawaharlal nehru university says the mass conversion to buddhism shows three trends. ""first, the social one. the conversion shows a fissure in the larger hindu society. then, politically, a split in the bsp support group, and lastly, growing personal political ambitions of some people claiming to be mere social dalit leaders."" gandhi points to the timing. ""is it a coincidence that the uttar pradesh elections are round the corner?"" he asks. it is pertinent that udit raj hails from allahabad in up and his point of reference is most often the condition of dalits in the state. gandhi also dismisses any ""religious angle"" to the conversion. ""the politics behind it is yet to show up fully, but it does show that those who constitute the top rung of hindu society are unable to manage inter-caste relations"", he says. the choice of buddhism, explains gandhi, is only symbolic. ""at least, ideologically buddhism has been regarded as part of the hindu umbrella."" the converted dalits see this as adopting a religion that has no distinctions, while their leaders see this as a tool to unify potential supporters and possibly use the base to enter politics on a later date, he adds.

15,Opp fears on terror law misplaced: Centre,"new delhi: the government on tuesday said the apprehensions voiced by a section of the public and political parties about the provisions of the prevention of terrorism ordinance were misplaced and based on incorrect information. ""statements (by political leaders) in this regard were being made without reading the law... there are no such provisions in the ordinance like disclosure of source by journalists or onus of proof being on the accused,"" law minister arun jaitley said after an over two hour meeting on the issue convened by home minister l k advani. the meeting, attended among others by central ministers nitish kumar, omar abdullah, chaman lal gupta, ved prakash goel, o rajagopal and ravi shankar prasad besides some bjp mps, was given a detailed presentation on the provisions of the ordinance by advani and officials of his ministry. jaitley said it was factually incorrect that the onus of proof had been shifted to the accused and journalists would have to declare their source. ""there are no such provisions. it is all a hallucination,"" jaitley said. coming out of the meeting, nitish kumar said, ""a large number of misplaced notions were dispelled at the meeting."" he said the opposition was carrying out a debate on non-existent issues and said the prevention of terrorism ordinance bill had been drafted by the law commission keeping in mind the negative aspects of the scrapped terrorist and disruptive activities (prevention) act. the meeting appears to have been convened to prepare the bjp and other nda partners to face the opposition during a debate on the issue, not only in the ensuing winter session of parliament, but also to dispel any misapprehensions among the general public. prime minister atal behari vajpayee and advani had strongly spoken in favour of bringing in such an anti-terrorist law and sought a national consensus on the issue. however, opposition parties had dubbed the suggestion as a move by the bjp-led government to bring about a chauvinistic consensus for electoral considerations using the prevailing scenario.

20,Punjab govt loses land to loopholes,"chandigarh:punjab government has squandered away thousands of acres of evacuee land that has been taken over by land-grabbers and illegal occupants. worse, instead of taking action against those who are culpable, the state government has legalised such land under the package deal act, which empowers the government to dispose of land in any way it deems fit.the government does not even have an estimate of how much land has been wrested away in this manner. now, when the government is trying to recover a fraction of this land, it faces a slew of petitions in the punjab and haryana high court.some of these petitions are contempt petitions where the petitioners have successfully moved the court to get back the land that had been originally allotted to them but which was found to have been taken by fraudulent means, a senior official said on condition of anonymity and added that this is deterring officials from probing deeply into the matter. the story begins in 1947 when in the aftermath of the partition a substantial number of persons claimed land in india in lieu of land they had left behind in pakistan. the pakistan and indian governments exchanged a list of revenue records which formed the basis of settling land claims of migrants. the process was over for all practical purposes in 1955.the instrument that regulated the allotment of land was the displaced persons (compensation and rehabilitation) act, 1954. under the the act, the cut-off date for filing all claims was fixed as december 31, 1963. all remained quiet for more than three decades until the early 1990s. from then on a flood of claims kept pouring in to the managing officer (mo), appointed under the act.then, through official collusion, land allotments began in earnest against claims that were officially closed on december 31, 1963. we don't even know how much land has been swindled away in this manner. to find that out would require reopening of thousands of cases, something that is physically impossible to carry out, the official said. he said that there was a clique of five-six lawyers who appeared in all these cases,on one side or the other. in fact they had made an industry of processing fraudulent claims in this manner. the modus operandi adopted varied, thanks to a large number of loopholes in the process and official corruption. in some cases, allotments were made on the basis of forged revenue extracts (goshwaras). these were then forwarded to headquarters here as a matter of routine. this only shows how brazenly the operatives managed to go on without any fear. allotments were also made on the basis of unauthenticated entries into the revenue record. in other cases, repeat allotments were made to the same person while fake power of attorney was used in many cases. all this has put a question mark on the authenticity of revenue records in punjab given that people have been able to manipulate these with such ease.

21,'Tricolour could revive flagging patriotism',"new delhi: his patriotism is tricoloured. navin jindal, businessman with a conscience, has ceased to be just a crusader. he is now converting people to his view that it is the right of every indian to display the national flag. not that 31-year-old jindal wears his flag on his sleeve. now in the seventh year of a legal battle with the government for his ""freedom of speech and expression,"" jindal asserts that the right to fly the flag should come with the commitment that there shall be no disrespect shown. he tries to laugh away the unsavoury incident involving page three regular malini ramani, who made a social appearance draped in the indian flag. if not done offensively, wearing the tricolour is not disrespectful, he feels. a tee-shirt with the flag, for instance, is a good idea. ""we were slaves for centuries, did not have our own flag. and when we do, we have not had the right to display it for 54 years. it is a shame."" jindal's battle is against the attitude that flying the tricolour is a privilege reserved for a special few. ""it is every indian's flag,"" he asserts. jindal, who is the executive vice-chairman and managing director of jindal steels and power ltd, juggles cause and career adroitly. he has been doing so for years. it all began when as a 20-year-old mba student in texas university, a homesick jindal discovered his love for the motherland. ""i was inspired by the pride that the americans took in displaying their flag. i wanted to do that too."" he did. and spent the rest of his student years in the us with a large tricolour dominating all else in his room. jindal brought back with him his deep attachment to the symbol of indian sovereignty. in india, he flew the tricolour at home and work with all ceremony due it. but the authorities were not amused. the government removed the flags and a distraught jindal sued in court. the young businessman admits he had not expected so long a legal battle. ""the case took very little time in the high court. but after the government took the matter to the supreme court, it has gone on for years."" he is now awaiting a final supreme court judgment, perhaps on november 8, the next date of hearing. jindal regrets the delay over ""so harmless an issue"".

22,Activist protests asbestos poisoning,"kolkata: social and environmental activist sudam mitra has launched a tirade against the engineers in the state public health engineering department for joining hands with the asbestos mafia operating in collusion with canadian asbestos mine owners. mitra has written on behalf of kalyaneswari, an ngo, to chief minister buddhadeb bhattacharjee, phe department in-charge gautam deb, cpm politbureau member anil biswas, health minister surya kanta mishra and opposition leader pankaj banerjee, seeking immediate action against errant officials who have allegedly encouraged the purchase of over rs 90 crore worth defective asbestos pipes. mitra claimed that the department had procured twice the amount required and stacked them at the central godowns at kalyani and siliguri apart from those at guruk, manteswar, raniganj, mathurapur, janai. our repeated plea to phe department to stop asbestos cement pipes for supply of drinking water to the cummunity have gone into deaf ears, mitra said. despite recommendations by the world health organisation, municipality and phe department are supplying potable water through these carcinogenic asbestos pipes in rural areas. engineers at the phe department acknowledge that asbestos pipes are being used and say they have no plans to stop its use in future. they argued that while breathing asbestos fibres was carcinogenic, the same did not apply to consumption of asbestos with water as lungs remained unaffected. you should visit a doctor to seek better explanation. but if you have any material to suggest that asbestos pipes are harmful, do bring them to us so that we may be enlightened, the official said when asked if they were aware of the health hazards in use of asbestos cement pipes. people from several districts have made several deputations to the principal secretary and chief engineers of phe department for stopping use of asbestos cement pipes. asbestos pipes in different godowns and premises of phe department are substandard and of inferior quality. samples collected from the suppliers have failed in all technical and mechanical parameters in tests conducted at the national test house in alipur, mitra said. in asansol, asbestos pipes burst in august, killing eight people due to contamination. in uttarpara too, leakage in asbestos pipes led to spread of jaundice.
