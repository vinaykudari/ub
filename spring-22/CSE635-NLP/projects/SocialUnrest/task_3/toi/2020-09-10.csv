2,PUTA calls for teachers' rally,"PATNA: The Patna University Teachersâ€™ Association (PUTA) here on Wednesday appealed to the teachers of Patna University to demonstrate before the university office on September 11 to register their protest over the unjustified fixation of salary of the rank of lecturer for readers and professors who had been given time-bound promotion earlier.

The president and the general secretary of PUTA, Jagannath Thakur and Amarnath Singh, respectively, in a release said that the vice chancellor of Patna University had violated an order of the high court in CWJC number 11986/2001 and the orders of universityâ€™s statutory bodies like syndicates and the pay fixation committee.

In a release, they said: The teachers of Patna University express strong resentment over the action of the vice chancellor which is not only unjustified but also amounts to contempt of the high court order passed on a writ petition. They added that the vice chancellor had violated his own affidavit which he had sworn in MJC 2694/2002 about fixation of salary of readers and professors promoted under the time-bound promotion scheme.

Meanwhile, over a hundred students, under the banner of All India Students Federation (AISF), staged a dharna before the chancellor of Bihar in protest against the decline in the standard of education in the state.

3,'Gift of gab' must for LU elections,"LUCKNOW: Now, student leaders will also have to prove their oratory skills to the student polity, as from this year on the system of â€˜qualifying speechâ€™ has been re-introduced in the studentsâ€™ union elections in the stateâ€™s universities and degree colleges.

Students contesting for the different posts will have to deliver speeches before an audience comprising students and will be required to prove their worth by convincing and satisfying the queries of the voters.

This was announced at a meeting called by Lucknow University authorities and attended by district administration officials, to inform the student leaders about the election code of conduct. The assembling of student leaders outside the DPA hall â€” the venue for the meeting â€” and the pomp and flourish on display was reminiscent of the Darul-Shafa, the legislature hostel, where MLAs can be seen flaunting their costly four-wheelers and their multitudes of supporters.

Although, LU student leaders are officially only â€˜studentsâ€™ and are aspirants to the union posts, their â€˜fanfareâ€™ was no less than that of regular politicians. Not surprisingly, most of the student leaders including over a dozen (who are not enrolled in any of the courses at LU, but still call themselves student leaders) had come in their flashy four-wheelers, all in the range of a price tag of Rs 3-6 lakh, with big name-plates announcing that they were maniniya chatra netas. While almost all such â€˜leadersâ€™ flashed cell phones, a few student leaders also had police escorts and most had the flags of the party to which they bear allegiance, fluttering on their vehicles.

Every student leader was handed a copy of the code of conduct, which prohibits the use of loud-speakers, processions, graffiti, posters and forcible occupation of hoarding of commercial establishments. They were also reminded that there is a ceiling of Rs 10,000 per candidate on the election expenditure. Besides the LU proctor Prof VD Mishra and other senior LU professors, the ADM (Trans Gomti) AK Dwivedi and the SP (Trans Gomti) SV Singh were present on the occasion.

Students associated with the Studentsâ€™ Federation of India (SFI) raised a valid point by questioning how officials will check the misuse of muscle and money power during the elections. They suggested that student leaders be asked to submit a detailed account of their expenses and a committee be set-up to verify their claims. ABVP leaders raised objections over the blatant show of muscle power by Samajwadi Party leaders who have put up hoardings and posters all around the LU campus. Students also objected to restrictions on campaigning in the girlsâ€™ hostel.

Referring to reported failure of ministers to visit the district to review the drought situation, Poojari said it has come to his notice that a couple of ministers are not bothered to visit the drought prone areas. ""I have asked the chief minister to mend the ministers, who are not visiting the districts,"" he claimed. He added that even then the ministers who failed to abide by Krishnaâ€™s direction, will be seriously dealt.

9,Badal govt's policies ruined state: Singla,"LUDHIANA: Alleging that the previous SAD-BJP government has shattered the state economy through populist schemes, Surinder Singla, chairman of fiscal reforms committee set up by the state government said these parties were in fact enemies of Punjab farmers.

Addressing the rural gathering at historic Chhapar mela on Wednesday, Singla who is also Congress MLA from Bhatinda accused the previous government of maintaining double standards as they misled the farmers during their tenure by projecting misleading figures about the state''s agricultural income. ""Though this income was officially stated between Rs 17000-23000 crore but when the Congress government took over it actually turned out to be around Rs 13000 crore,"" he claimed.

Singla added that misgovernance and rampant corruption during their five years rule rendered the state bankrupt and restoring the financial health of the state was the Amarinder government''s priority.

He lashed out at SAD president and former chief minister Prakash Singh Badal for falsely claiming to be the sole champion of farmers as he always used his clout at the Centre for his own political interests.

Blaming the union government for discriminating against the state over distribution of funds for clearance of sugar cane arrears of farmers, Singla pointed out that the state got a meagre Rs 29 crore against due amount of Rs 100 crore while Haryana and others states had been given much more.

Not only this, the case put up by the state government asking for Rs 1250 crore meant to be used for bringing in much the needed diversification plan to bail out the state''s agriculture has not been cleared as yet, he claimed appreciating the efforts of chief minister Amarinder Singh for launching contract farming through the state''s resources for the benefit of farmers.

11,New policy seeks mining in forest areas,"GANDHINAGAR: The Gujarat government on Thursday decided to set up a stone artisan park in the ecologically fragile Ambaji-Dhrangardha belt joining north Gujarat with Saurashtra.

Placing the new mines and minerals policy in the state Assembly, Industries Minister Anil Patel said the government would press with the Centre to allow the mining of certain ""important minerals such as marble and dolomite"" in the reserved forest areas.

""By implementing the new policy, we plan to increase the total income the state gets out of mining activity from the current Rs 175 crore to Rs 500 crore within five years,"" Patel said.

""The production of the minerals would be increased by 10 per cent per year in the next five years, to reach 935 lakh tonnes. The industry involved in minerals would be guided by well-worked out rules,"" he added.

The policy talks of having private laboratories to test the minerals, introducing new courses in engineering colleges to prepare mines and minerals graduates and geologists, ensuring that no illegal mining activities take place in the state, and create a database for having a new minerals atlas.

An empowered committee under the chairmanship of the CM would be formed to oversee the implementation of the policy.

Making yet another announcement, Agriculture Minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasma declared the intention of the government to give the status of independent university to the four zones of the Gujarat Agricultural University at Junagadh, Anand, Navsari and Sardar Krishinagar Dantiwada. This, he said, has been necessitated by the need to decentralise the state''s agricultural economy''s needs.

The decisions were announced soon after the Opposition was thrown out of the Assembly for creating unruly scenes. The decisions were followed by quick passing of three Bills in the House. The Gujarat Sales Tax (Amendment) Bill, 2003, seeks to raise the sales tax on kerosene used for non-domestic use from eight per cent to 25.

Finance Minister Vajubhai Vala said, this was necessitated because of the need to curb adulteration of kerosene in diesel.

Minister Saurabh Patel said, ""in order to provide an effective mechanism to look into the complaints or allegations against this category of persons, the government considers it necessary to bring them within the purview of the Lokayukta for the purpose of purpose of investigation.""

The Bombay Prohibition (Gujarat Second Amendment) Bill, 2003, was passed so as to ensure that ""genuine traders of rotten gur and ammonium chloride"" are not put to trouble while transporting the two commodities. Pointing out that it would make the state''s prohibition laws even stricter, Minister Amit Shah said, ""it is considered necessary to power the state government to prescribe the conditions subject to which passes would be used to such traders for through transport...""

Meanwhile, Gujarat became the seventh state on Thursday to ratify the Constitution (95th Amendment) Bill, 2003, passed by both the houses of Parliament. Moving the resolution for ratification, Chief Minister Narendra Modi said, the ratification would allow the Centre to impose serve tax in the state, with the state getting a portion of it as income.

""Nearly 48 per cent of the household production is in the service sector. The state and the Centre would together take advantage of that,"" he added.

12,Student activists lathicharged and arrested,"MUMBAI: The police resorted to lathicharge and arrested more than 40 student activists on Thursday morning when they attempted to disrupt the medical admissions at St George hospital, CST.

The activists affilited to the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), the Students'' Federation of India (SFI) and Samayak Vidyarthi Andolan clashed with the police when they were prevented from entering the hospital compound. Medical admissions, which were stayed on Saturday, were to resume from Thursday after the Bombay high court directed students to pay 60 per cent of the fees proposed by private colleges.

13,JD (S) objects to CM's statement on farmers deaths,"MYSORE: District Janata Dal (S) President G T Devegowda on Thursday took strong objection to chief minister''s statement on farmers deaths and said Krishna has belittled the farmers by reportedly saying that farmers deaths were not so high and alarming as depicted in the media.

At a press meet here, he said Krishna himself has admitted that only 93 out of 156 inquired by the government were debt related deaths and others are yet to be verified.

""It is 93 or 300 and odd, Krishna should realize the fact that farmers in the state are in distress and there life is also precious as that of the others,"" he said, adding that Krishna by passing such derogatory remarks against farmers has admitted the farmers deaths.

Questioning Krishna''s claims that government is yet to establish the death of other farmers was due to debts, Devegowda said it does not need any big brain or intelligence to find out whether the death of a farmer is due to debts or due to some other reason.

""Just verify whether the deceased farmer has a survey number in his name or not and how much he has borrowed from the financial agencies on his survey number, this would establish the reality,"" he said.

He said only waiver of loans borrowed from commercial banks and other co-operative institutions will bring relief to the farmers who are in distress due to failure of crops following drought.

Alleging the state government of being bankrupt, Devegowda said the telephone connection of Doddaballapur AC office has been disconnected following failure to pay the bill. He said the government''s relief of 888 crore is a bogus claim where in reality there is neither any physical nor any fiscal gain for the farmers.

He said as part of the state party decision to protest the anti-farmers policies and attitude of the state government, the JD (S) workers will stage a day long dharna at the deputy commissioner''s office here on September 15 which will be led by state JD (S) President Siddaramaiah.

He also disclosed that the party has organised a function at Kabini Dam on September 17 to commemorate the death of Guruswamy in 2002 and also to pay homage to the farmers who have died in state following drought conditions.

14,'Action against co-operatives for not helping farmers',"KOTTAYAM: Kerala Co-operation Minister M V Raghavan on Thursday said the state government would adopt stringent measures against co-operative institutions which failed to help farmers.

Inaugurating the new loan schemes of Kottayam District Co-operative Bank here, Raghavan said the employees and co-operators should realise that co-operative institutions stood for their welfare.

The UDF government was trying to restructure the co-operative sector. The common man should get loans at low rate of interest, he said.

Raghavan said in most of the co-operative institutions the employees were influencing the ruling authorities and achieving their own self interest. The government would protect the interest of the employees, he said, adding these institutions were not only meant for employees but for common people also.

Law and Revenue Minister K M Mani on the occasion said in Kerala the problem was not shortage of capital, but not spending it in a profitable manner.

UDF convenor Oommen Chandy also attended the function.
