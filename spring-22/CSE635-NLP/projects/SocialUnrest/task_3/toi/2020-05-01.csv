1,"BJP, RSS meet to improve ties, plan for polls","NEW DELHI: A high-profile three-day meeting of Sangh Parivar leaders with the government and BJP representatives began on Thursday. The meetingâ€™s underlying agenda is improving relations between the RSS and the government.

Though RSS spokesman Ram Madhav described the meeting at the Chandiwala estate in South Delhi as â€˜â€˜routineâ€™â€™, the conclave of senior leaders of the RSS, all its affiliates and the government assumes significance as four important north Indian states go to polls in the next six months.

â€˜â€˜The meeting is aimed at bringing in better coordination and understanding between all the affiliates of the RSS and the government. A message of perfect understanding between the government and the Parivar would go out after such a meeting,â€™â€™ said an RSS source.

Prime Minister Vajpayee, DPM L K Advani, HRD minister Murli Manohar Joshi, BJP president Venkaiah Naidu and general secretaries attended the meeting.

The RSS was represented by sarsanghachalak K S Sudarshan, the joint general secretary in charge of BJP, Madandas Devi, H V Seshadri, M G Vaidya and the spokesman Ram Madhav. Ashok Singhal of the Vishwa Hindhu Parishad (VHP), Muralidhar Rao of the Swadeshi Jagran Manch (SJM) were present along with representatives of other affiliates like the Bharatiya Mazdoor Singh, the Vanvasi Kalyan Ashram, the Vidyarthi Parishad.

The forenoon session of the meeting was devoted to forge a consensus on various contentious issues. Internal security and Kashmir were also likely to figure in discussions. A greater understanding among all the affiliates would become a pre-requisite for a coordinated election campaign for the BJP.

According to PTI, Madandas Devi was asked about the outbursts against the government by parivar outfits including the VHP and the SJM. He admitted a â€˜â€˜communication gapâ€™â€™ among its affiliates and said, â€˜â€˜all organisations look at national interests in their own way.

They are free to express their thoughts in a democracy but that should be done with civility and without bitterness. All issues can be sorted out through communication.â€™â€™

The Ayodhya issue, the J&K governmentâ€™s â€˜â€˜healing touchâ€™â€™ policy, the next WTO round in Mexico, religious conversions and ban on cow slaughter are among the key issues to be discussed during the three-day meet.

2,Converter kit can keep old trucks moving: AIMTC,"PUNE: Approximately 1.26 lakh old transport vehicles in the state can be saved from being scrapped if they are fitted with a converter kit, which will be tested by the Ahmednagar-based Vehicle Research and Development Establishment (VRDE) on May 5.

This was disclosed by Baba Dhumal, president of the All-India Motor Transport Congress (AIMTC), during a news conference here on Thursday. Dhumal said all the 15-year-old transport vehicles can be fitted with the kit, which will reduce emission levels and satisfy pollution norms.

The kit, costing Rs 5,000, will be tested by the VRDE, he said, adding that if the tests proved successful, the problem of old commercial vehicles could be solved without harming anybodyâ€™s interests.

The AIMTC had recently organised a nation-wide strike over various issues, including the scrapping of eight- and 15-year-old vehicles. Dhumal said even the Union ministry of road transport agreed during negotiations at the time of the strike that emission norms, fitness and road safety of a vehicle should be taken into consideration, instead of the age of the vehicle.

He said his association would shortly file an affidavit in the Bombay high court in this regard. Giving details of the recent negotiations with the Centre, Dhumal said the government has constituted a committee to examine the methodology of working out the toll to be charged for various vehicles on four-lane national highways.

He and AIMTC secretary J.M. Saxena have been nominated on the committee, which will submit its report within two months. The Union government has clarified that value added tax (VAT) will not be applied to the transport sector as it was part of the service sector, Dhumal said.

The government has instructed the state governments to take strict action against overloading of transport vehicles, failing which the government would invoke provisions of the Central Road Fund Act 2000 and stop their grants, he added. Dhumal stated that the government has instructed public sector insurance companies to strictly follow insurance related norms.

The transport ministry has agreed to investigate specific cases of violation intimated by the AIMTC and assured that those found guilty would be dealt with. On the issue of converting old vehicles to CNG/LPG in Maharashtra, the AIMTC will file an affidavit in the Bombay high court, Dhumal said.

â€œWe are ready to convert our vehicles provided the state government took the responsibility of supplying adequate CNG/LPG stations. Else, the court should extend the deadline,â€� he said.

Dhumal circulated copies of the memorandum signed by him and Ashoke Joshi, secretary, ministry of road transport, which facilitated the withdrawal of the indefinite strike.

3,Experts frame SARS rules,"KOLKATA: Asitava Purakayastha, the first confirmed SARS patient in the state, might be feeling much better, but it will a while before he can return home. He will be confined to the Infectious Diseases Hospital in Beliaghata for another 11 days.

Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) experts along with a group of doctors at the ID hospital on Wednesday have decided on a discharge protocol for SARS patients admitted to the hospital. However, the state health department will have to approve the protocol.

The protocol specifies if the patient did not record fever for 48 hours and the cough reduces with a clear chest X-ray, he will be transferred to a â€˜convalescenceâ€™ ward. He will stay there for nine days. If the blood sample is tested and found to be normal, the patient will be fit for discharge. On Wednesday, the ID hospital was under a siege, with the family members of patients and doctors as well as media was denied entry.

However, hospital principal Pushpa Maitra said the condition of the SARS patients was stable. Though surgeon superintendent of SSKM hospital, Deb Dwaipayan Chat t o p a d -hyay, hurriedly reached some cardiac instruments to the ID Hospital on Tuesday, the cardiac unit still lacked some obvious facilities.

Among them were multi-point gadgets like catheter, blood gas analyser, ventilators, pulse oxymeter and defibrillator. Even the doctors seemed disgusted. â€œWe are supposed to tackle a cardiac patient without the basic equipment,â€� they said. Policemen posted in front of the SARS ward said that they did not have any protective masks. Nurses also accused the government of not supplying them adequate gear to protect themselves. â€œWe were promised that masks would be provided. But even after a duty of 10 hours, there is no sign of masks,â€� alleged a senior police officer.

Health department officials were at a loss about arranging 200 additional beds at the hospital as promised by the government on Tuesday. â€œWe have been able to organise only 100 beds,â€� said a senior health official. This may affect the normal functioning of the hospital. Meanwhile, patients avoided ID hospital on Wednesday. â€œIn the summer, there are at least 20 admissions a day for diarrhoeal diseases. But for the last two days, there are only four of five admissions per day,â€� claimed the doctor on duty at the emergency.

4,Government puts helmet rule on hold,"HYDERABAD: Home minister T Devender Goud on Thursday instructed the police not to impose a deadline for two-wheeler drivers to start wearing helmets. Instead, he asked them to take up an awareness programme to educate people on the benefits of wearing helmets.

This would mean that the May 7 deadline announced by additional commissioner of police (traffic) D T Nayak will not come into force. The ministerâ€™s directions came at a meeting with senior police and transport officers.

Among those who attended the meeting were police commissioner M V Krishna Rao, additional commissioner (coordination) A K Khan, the additional commissioner (traffic) and commissioner of Cyberabad police M Mahender Reddy. The meeting was convened in view of media reports on the non-availability of helmets and resentment among some people.

Goud asked police and transport department officials not to act in haste and make sure people were not harassed.

The meeting apparently discussed the High Court order on wearing of helmets. The participants reportedly were of the view that the government â€” if needed â€” had the powers to make changes in the provisions in the Motor Vehicles (MV) Act relating to wearing of helmets. Even otherwise, they hoped that the court would take into consideration all practical problems coming in the way of making wearing of helmets mandatory.

However, Dr C S Subba Rao, the man who moved court for making wearing of helmets compulsory, differed with the views of these government officials. â€œThe statement of the home minister not to implement sections 128 and 129 of the MV Act, 1988, in the face of the order given by the High Court on Oct. 30, 2002 and especially when contempt proceedings are pending against the home secretary, transport secretary and the director-general of police, is in clear contravention of the central act.

So, the state government has no authority to contravene the central Act, especially when the High Court has quashed the GO of 1989, which made wearing of helmets optional.â€�

The government had earlier cited the â€œsevere drought conditionsâ€� as a reason for not being too eager to enforce the helmet regulation. But sources said the government was wary of the adverse public reaction to the order. Apparently, several people from the Muslim community have raised objections to the diktat saying their women wore burkhas and helmets would make matters difficult for them.

Another reason the government used to keep away from enforcing the High Court order was shortage of helmets.

5,CM’s directive to ministers,"HYDERABAD: Chief minister Chandrababu Naidu has instructed his cabinet colleagues to launch campaigns to erase the impression that the TDP cadre had benefited financially from the numerous government schemes.

According to sources, the chief minister discussed the issue during the cabinet meeting on Thursday, and expressed concern over the perception that only the party cadre had benefited from government schemes.

Naidu told the ministers to come up with new schemes targeting Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, backward castes, farmers and youngmen to counter the TRS campaign and the padayatra of the opposition leader Y S Rajasekhara Reddy. The schemes would be discussed at the partyâ€™s forthcoming Mahanadu and would be implemented accordingly.

Sources add that Naidu instructed ministers to compile data on the various development activities taken up in the last seven-and-half years. The chief minister also expressed displeasure over the â€˜failureâ€™ of the officials to complete the Janmabhoomi works.

7,Security beefed up for Sonia's rally in Jammu,"JAMMU: Security arrangements have been beefed up in Reasi town of Udhampur district here in view of AICC President Sonia Gandhi''s scheduled public rally on Saturday.

Police and security forces have been alerted to make foolproof security arrangements in the town where the AICC chief is likely to address a gathering of 25,000 to 30,000 people on Saturday, official sources said here on Friday.

8,8 dead in N Dinajpur pre-poll violence,"CHOPRA/SILIGURI: Following fresh violence on Thursday, the death toll in pre-panchayat CPM-Congress poll clashes at Chopra in North Dinajpur district has increased to eight.

CPM supporters went on the rampage following district secretariat member Akbar Ali''s killing, allegedly by Congress supporters, and the death of three more party supporters in police firing on Wednesday. Four more people were killed. AICC member S. Malakar claimed all were Congress supporters.

While the police and Rapid Action Force were deployed in large numbers on Friday, Chopra feared a bloodbath after the panchayat polls are over. A. Haque, a businessman of Sonapur village, said, â€œIt will set in motion chain of violent incidents after elections end.â€�

Former chief minister Jyoti Basu hauled up the police for â€œgiving shelter to criminals inside police stationsâ€� but also criticised the incidents that took place on Wednesday. â€œWe do not want our supporters to adopt violence.â€� The entire block witnessed several retaliatory poiltical clashes, a large number of houses were burnt, people were beaten up, policemen were injured. Markets were closed for the day and the entire area was deserted.

Fourteen persons, including Congress leader Hamidul Rahman, were arrested. The police had fired on Wednesday when irate CPM supporters tried to snatch Rahman from the custody of the police inside Chopra PS. Congress leader Priya Ranjan Das Munshi was heckled in Dalkhola when he visited the spot. â€œSeventy CPM supporters came down on me and assaulted my driver,â€� claimed Das Munshi. However, CPM district secretariat member S. Biswas described the clashes as â€œan outburst of the common masses against the corruption of Congress leaders.â€�

Chopra block, an agro-based zone with numerous small tea and pineapple plantations, is a commercially important plane located on NH 34. Its location â€“ within 25 km from Nepal, Bangladesh and Bihar â€“ makes it an ideal place for cross-border criminals.

Politically, it is important for both the Congress and the CPM to keep the place under their respective spheres of influence, leading to frequent showdowns. Slain CPM leader Akbar Ali had been defeated by Independent candidate Hamidul Islam by only 1,100 votes in the last Assembly polls. The latter joined the Congress afterwards.

The Congress could bag seven of eight gram panchayat seats and the only panchayat samity seat in the area. A number of Congress panchayat members were charged in different corruption cases. â€œSeeing such corruption, people were determined to bring about a change this time, which made the Congress scared and they started terrorising people,â€� Basu said.
