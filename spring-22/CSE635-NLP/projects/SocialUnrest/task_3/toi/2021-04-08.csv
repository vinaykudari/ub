0,Man arrested for Rs 19.5-lakh fraud,"NEW DELHI: A 49-year-old man was arrested by the economic offences wing (EOW) of the Delhi Police on Monday under charges of cheating. The accused, Ravinder Kumar, had cheated a man of Rs 19.5 lakh.

Kumar was arrested based on a complaint by Akbar Ali.

According to the police, Kumar cheated Ali of Rs 19.5 lakh on the pretext of selling him a shop in Panchsheel Park. Kumar also sold off Ali''s Maruti Esteem car and kept the money from the sale.

""The property Kumar was supposedly going to sell to Ali was actually lying mortgaged with Punjab National Bank. When Ali decided to pull out of the deal Kumar issued him post dated cheques from accounts that had already been closed. He then sold the concerned property to someone else,"" said DCP (EOW) Dinesh Bhatt.

The police are trying to ascertain any other instances where Kumar may have cheated others. Kumar was sent to two days police custody on Monday.

1,"Now, yantras to rule over Metro mantra","NEW DELHI: Delhi Metro has a new inspiration: Maharaja Jai Singh''s 18th-century observatory. Striving to create a link between the city''s architectural heritage and modern-day technology, Delhi Metro will be emulating Jantar Mantar''s curved walls and red sandstone architecture at entrances of underground Metro stations.

DMRC will design the entrances of the underground stations using Agra red sandstone. The stations on Line 2 from ISBT to Delhi University will have bus bays and the walls behind these bays will be curved.

They will rise till the front end and will have a large aperture for Delhi Metro''s logo. Chief architect of DMRC Tripta Khurana said: ""We wanted something that characterised Delhi and had a hint of Mughal and medieval architecture. That is why we have taken this from the yantras of Jantar Mantar.""

Entrances will be located directly off the footpath. A person will get down from a bus or an auto at the bay and will walk on the footpath and enter the station directly.

There will be provision for escalators to take the commuter down to the platform level. A public lift for the elderly and physically challenged will be provided at the entrance.

""We will keep the number at one per station at the entrance. These will have a mirror at the back so that a person can reverse his wheelchair while looking for obstruction in the path in the mirror,"" said Khurana.

The station entrances will have proper landscaping. Sturdy but shady trees and flowering plants that do not need too much water will be planted near the station and parking areas.

Lighting will play a key role in enhancing the exteriors and the interiors of the underground Metro station.

Khurana explained: ""Lighting is crucial in the underground stations as it enhances the design and also creates a sense of security. We have used different types of lights and more lights to keep the structures well-lit.""

At the entrance, wall washers will be used to light the walls so that people feel secure while entering the underground stations at night. The top canopy and the platforms will have lights at the top edge.

2,Thackeray discharged in ’91 riot case,"MUMBAI: On a state government plea, additional chief metropolitan magistrate J B Pankhe on Wednesday discharged Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray and 24 others in a 1991 riot and ransacking case.

In 1997, the BJP-Sena government had moved the court seeking withdrawal of prosecution for want of evidence.

It was turned down, following which the state appealed in the high court.

Last July, the HC set aside the lower court order and directed it to consider the plea afresh for withdrawal of prosecution.

3,Modi guns for Sonia at Joshi rally,"MUMBAI: Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi has demanded an explanation from Congress president Sonia Gandhi as to why she still maintains a house in Italy if she proclaims repeatedly that she is the daughter-in-law of India.

Modi was addressing a public meeting at Matunga in north-central Mumbai on Wednesday as part of the election campaign for Lok Sabha speaker Manohar Joshi, who is contesting the parliamentary polls on a Shiv Sena ticket.

Modi said an Indian daughter-in-law would never say that her maternal property was more important than the property she had acquired after marriage.

Gandhi was such an insignificant factor in Indian politics that not a single newspaper had written in her favour, Modi maintained. Modi lamented that whenever he raised genuine issues, like Gandhiâ€™s administrative inexperience or her â€œfeeling of disdainâ€™â€™ for India, the media criticised him instead of Gandhi. If she was in the electoral arena it was quite natural that various issues concerning her would come to the fore, he said.

He alleged that only two individuals, Sonia Gandhi and Pakistan president Pervez Musharraf, did not enjoy the feel-good atmosphere created by Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.

He said India had achieved spectacular success in various fields under Vajpayee. The entire world was praising India and Vajpayee, only Gandhi and the Congress were engaged in negative campaigning against the nation, he said.

Modi also criticised Muslim leader Syed Shahabuddin, who joined the Congress on Tuesday. He said Shahabuddin â€œtried to divide Indiaâ€™â€™, first in connection with the Shah Bano case and later over the Ayodhya issue. Modi asked if the Congress subscribed to Shahabuddinâ€™s views on Ayodhya.

On the Godhra train carnage, Modi said Congress spokesman Kapil Sibal was advocating the case of the perpetrators of the massacre in the supreme court.

Let the Congress clarify its stand on this matter, he said. Later onWednesday night,Modi addressed a public meeting at Vile Parle as part of the campaign for the Senaâ€™s Sanjay Nirupam.

4,VHP: No polls without mandir issue,"CHANDIGARH: The Vishwa Hindu Parishad senior vice-president, Acharya Giriraj Kishore, on Wednesday, asserted that the Lok Sabha elections in the country cannot be fought without raising the Ram Mandir issue during campaigns and in party manifestoes.

Kishore was reacting to the BJPâ€™s vision document referring to the Ram Mandir issue at a press conference here. Though he welcomed the inclusion of the Ram Mandir issue in the BJPâ€™s manifesto, the VHP leader pointed out that the BJP had been modifying its stand on the temple issue since 1996.

Expressing happiness over NDA convenor George Fernandes endorsing the BJPâ€™s views on the Ram Mandir issue, he said the BJP was only trying to please the Hindu voters to whom the temple at Ayodhya was close to the heart.

Asserting that the VHP would start construction of the Ram Mandir within the next two years, he said the outfit would circulate a â€˜Hindu Agendaâ€™ among political parties and candidates in the Lok Sabha polls and urge them to endorse it.

â€˜â€˜Whoever supports the Hindu Agenda and endorses it will get the support of the VHP during the elections. No party or candidate is an untouchable to the VHP. We will support any party or candidate promising to implement the Hindu Agenda after victory at the hustings,â€™â€™ the senior VHP leader said. The â€˜Hindu Agendaâ€™ listed the contentious demands of the Sangh Parivar including the abrogation of Article 370 providing special status to Jammu and Kashmir; enactment of uniform civil code; and laws for banning of cow slaughter and religious conversions. Kishore said when the VHP circulated the â€˜Hindu Agendaâ€™ for the first time during the 1999 LS polls, 155 candidates, including 11 from NDA constituents, had signed it.

To a query, the VHP leader said that his outfit was against foreigners including Congress president Sonia Gandhi occupying highest public offices in the country, â€˜â€˜as they could pose a grave security threat.â€™â€™

On Babri Masjid Action Committee leader Syed Shahabuddin joining the Congress, Kishore dismissed it saying, â€˜â€˜BMAC is a spent force today, so Shahabuddin has sought refuge in the party that is closest to his fundamentalist ideas.â€™â€™

5,"Despite protest, animal symbols stay for polls","LUCKNOW: The Election Commission finds itself helpless with regards to the demand of animal activists that animals not be used as election symbols. This is because of insistence of political parties to use such symbols.

On persistent request from numerous animal activists including Maneka Gandhi, the Election Commission had to drop many animal symbols from its list of free symbols. Till the previous election, the EC had kept 45 free symbols and of them many were animals. Independents are allotted symbols from these free symbols to fight elections.

As to animal symbols, elephant continues to be the symbol of Bahujan Samaj Party, which is a national party. Elephant also continues to be the symbol of Assom Ganna Parishad in Assam.

Despite constant efforts by EC, none of the two parties agreed to give up this symbol, said an EC official. While independent candidates were forced by the EC not to insist on animal symbols, it could do nothing in cases of powerful outfits like Bahujan Samaj Party and many others, said the official.

Another example is the â€˜lionâ€™ symbol. It is a symbol of Maharastravadi Gomantk party in Goa, Peoplesâ€™ Hill State Democratic Party in Meghalaya and also of the Forward Bloc in West Bengal. Here again, the EC failed to align political parties to its point of view.

But animal activists did not give up their opposition and succeeded in getting symbols like parrot dropped from the free symbols list on the plea that campaigners often inflict cruelty to the bird, said an EC official.

Then the EC dropped it along with some other symbols like battery-torch, brinjal and hand-pumps from its list of free symbols. But as soon as the EC dropped â€˜chairâ€™ from its list of free symbols, Uttarakhand Kranti Dal, which is a state party in the hill state, grabbed it in the hope that it would bring good luck.

Once the battery-torch and ink-pen were dropped from the list, National Democratic Movement of Nagaland and Democratic Peoplesâ€™ Party of Jammu and Kashmir grabbed them. Any free symbol which has sent a winner is craved by smaller parties, admitted the EC official.

6,'Liberate yourself from BJP's misrule',"LUCKNOW:Former Union minister and noted Supreme Court lawyer, Ram Jethmalani on Wednesday announced his candidature as a Congress-supported independent candidate from Lucknow seat against Prime Minister Vajpayee.

Talking to newsmen here, Jethmalani said that he would file his nomination shortly. Betraying any sign of worry for being pitted against a heavyweight leader like Vajpayee, he claimed that he had the support of Congress, Lok Janshakti Party and Bihar chief minister, Laloo Prasad Yadav, besides Muslims.

The tragic happenings in Gujarat are painful reminder of the mutual genocide of 1947, he said, adding â€œI am here to establish that the minorities can trust the majority community to ensure their security, dignity and equality.â€�

But the most debatable is the Congress support to him. The BJP had already begun its campaign, saying that the Congress had become so bankrupt that it was now ready to support even Jethmalani, who saved the killer of former prime minister Indira Gandhi. Taking on this allegation, the criminal lawyer said that the judicial system would break down if the law refused to take its course.

While calling the BJPâ€™s slogan of India Shining as the biggest bluff, based on falsehoods and far from ground realities, the lawyer in the same vein criticised the ruling Samajwadi Party and the BSP for betraying peopleâ€™s faith by forging a tacit understanding with the BJP. Notwithstanding their public posturing against the BJP, both SP and BSP were hand in glove with the BJP. This, he said was no less than an â€˜offence of 420â€™ strictly in legal term.

One of the conditions put by him, he said was that he would contest only on support of a united opposition. He regretted that SP and BSP had refused to support him, predictably for their own political compulsion to keep Vajpayee in good humour for post-poll alliance. Their decision, he said, surprised him, as he had rendered his services in their trying times to both SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav and BSP leader Mayawati.

But then he said, it was of no consequence to him, as he had been encouraged to contest the election by peopleâ€™s delegations and minorities, who had assured him their unflinching support and cooperation. This was the sole motivation, he said, adding that he would give Vajpayee a run for his money in the forthcoming poll. And reassuring voters, he said he was ready to make any sacrifice, provided Lucknowites were ready to liberate themselves from the misrule of the BJP.

Jethmalani, who is also a Rajya Sabha member and has still two more years to go, said that he was not in Lucknow for any recognition, but to fight against the BJP. Although he said he had nothing personal against Vajpayee, whom he described his â€˜good friend,â€™ he said he had chosen to challenge him because the BJP wanted to ride on his piggyback by projecting him as central theme of its vision document.

7,'BA paper flaws due to lack of staff',"PUNE: Glitches in the ongoing Bachelor of Arts (BA) question papers conducted by the University of Pune (UoP) were due to a shortage of qualified people and the ever-increasing workload, said experts on Wednesday.

The first flaw was exposed on Monday, when the second year BA Marathi exam had to be postponed because the question paper was not printed.

And on Tuesday, the third year BA Hindi question paper turned out to be identical to that of the one set in 2002.

M.S. Phirange, controller of examinations, at UoP, when contacted, said an inquiry had been ordered to probe the incident. He declined to give details.

Former controller of examinations Santosh Dastane said the main problem was a lack of qualified paper setters. In the current system, a panel, consisting of experienced professors, set three papers for a subject.

Of these, one was finally selected by the university administration, he said. Dastane, currently director of Neville Wadia Institute of Management, also said that in some academic branches, there were few trained and experienced professors who could be involved in the process.

""Though there are many colleges, some professors are not qualified enough,"" he said, adding that this was especially true in case of branches like engineering, law, management and computer science.

Dastane said glitches were possible due to a heavy workload. ""There are a large number of papers to be set and a mistake is possible at the last moment,"" he explained, adding that there were around 250 colleges and three lakh students under the university''s ambit.

Dastane said more people are needed for the purpose and the cap on recruitments should be lifted.

University assistant registrar Prakash Kunte, who has also served as assistant registrar of the confidential section, said, ""It is likely that the paper setting committee repeated the paper out of laxity. More trained people are required to overcome these problems.""

Students Federation of India (SFI) general secretary Maharudra Dake said the incident has exposed the carelessness on the part of the university authorities.

Blaming the UoP for taking the examination process lightly, he demanded that the government set up a commission to probe such incidents.

Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) students'' wing city president Pradeep Deshmukh blamed the lack of autonomy in the university for the incident.

""The various departments should be given autonomy to take their own decisions and a division of work is necessary to prevent such incidents in future,"" he said.

8,"No 'poaching' for polls, states told","NEW DELHI: The environment ministry has warned off another set of ''poachers'' - this time, state officials tempted to dip into tiger reserves to shore up their poll machinery with men, vehicles, even the wireless.

""It''s a problem,"" says Project Tiger chief Rajesh Gopal, whose department has reminded states such as UP and Bihar that EC directives exempt wildlife protection officials from poll duty.

From Bihar''s sole tiger reserve, Valmiki, complaints were coming in of forcible occupation of a wireless-cum-store room by the para-military in the name of election duty.

There was a fear that the tiger reserve staff would be deployed as well. The famous Dudhwa reserve in UP also reported of an attempt by state officials to take away their staff.

NGOs report similar complaints from some other reserves, such as Palamau in Jharkhand and Pench in MP.

10,Jewellers down shutters to protest murder,"PATNA: Most of the jewellery shops were closed down in the city on Wednesday in protest against the killing of prominent jeweller, Sheo Narain Gupta.

They demanded the immediate arrest of the killers involved in the killing. Gupta was shot dead near Gupta complex, owned by him, in Gardanibagh Road no. 1 area under the same police station on April 5.

The incident was attributed to Gupta''s failure to pay extortion money demanded by a notorious criminal lodged in jail. However, the police are yet to make any arrest in this connection. A delegation of city jewellers on Wednesday met senior SP N H Khan and submitted a memorandum.

Apart from the arrest of Gupta''s killers, they demanded proper security for the family members of the slain jeweller. When contacted, the SSP said that he has assured the jewellers that patrolling would be intensified in areas where there are jewellery shops.

""I asked them to give suggestions which can help the police to check criminals from targeting them. After the end of parliamentary polls, the district police will work out a strategy to put an effective check on crime against businessmen in the city,"" he added.

Sachivalaya DSP Arshad Zaman claimed that the police had made a breakthrough in this case.

""We have succeeded in identifying the gang involved in the killing. Police are raiding suspected hideouts of the criminals,"" he said. Earlier, the killing had sent shock waves among the jewellers in the city.

""Earlier, a jeweller, Deepak, was killed in Phulwarisharif area after his refused to pay extortion money to a gang of criminals. Gupta was killed for the same reason. We can''t carry arms with us. We are left with no other option, but to pay extortion money to run our business in the city,"" said a jeweller on condition of anonymity.

11,Govt health policy draws criticism,"PATNA: It was perhaps the most opportune moment to take the national health policy head-on and who could do it better than doctors. Medical professionals gathered at PMCH on Wednesday on the occasion of World Health Day (foundation day of WHO) criticised the government''s health policy for its sectarian approach. Concern was also expressed on the deterioration of public health in Bihar.

The meeting was organised by the Bihar Chapter of Indian Doctors for Peace and Development (IDPD) and Indian Medical Association.

Speaking on the occasion, the HoD of social medicine, JNU, Dr Imrana Qadeer, said that our national programmes fail because they are not able to cover more than 30-32 per cent of population. She was speaking on the topic ""National health policy with Bihar perspective"".

She said that we are falling into the trap of accepting technological answers to problems which are not only technological but also social.

""The doctor''s role has to be redefined in the perspective of national health policy,which is being guided by economists,"" she said.

""If you distort the priorities and increase the number of services, you will not be able to help the poor. That is what the present policy is doing,"" she lamented.

Earlier, state IMA president Vijay Shankar Singh expressed concern over the allocation of only 2.7 per cent of the budget to health in Bihar.

He also said that here only one bed was available for a population of 8,000. He also said that there were only 2,500 doctors in various hospitals of Bihar. He also expressed concern over the entry of MNCs in healthcare, which has led to treatment getting out of reach of people.

""Healthcare is fast becoming an industry with doctors as their chief managers,"" he remarked.

Among others who spoke on the occasion were secretary, IDPD, Bihar, Dr Satyajit Kumar Singh, PMCH principal Dr M L Verma, Dr Manju Geeta Mishra and Dr Arun Thakur. Also present on the occasion were Dr Lala Suraj Nandan Prasad, Dr P Gupta, Dr S N Arya, Dr S L Mandal, Dr Sharda Sahay and Dr JD Singh.

12,Poll violence flares up in Andhra,"HYDERABAD: In what could be an indication of things to come as the election atmosphere hots up, workers of political parties on Wednesday turned three towns in the state into battlefields.

Incidentally, it was the ruling TDP men who were at the vanguard of Wednesday''s events as were they on Tuesday.

Elsewhere in Visakhapatnam, a visibly worried TDP supremo Chandrababu Naidu announced that all persons who have indulged in violence over the last two days would not be spared and will be suspended from the party.

Chilakaluripet in Guntur district, Nagari and Vayalpadu in Chittoor district and Tadipatri in Anantapur district on Wednesday witnessed pitched battles between TDP activists, Congress workers and the police.

And in all the three towns, the police had to open fire into the air to quell the mobs, but not with great success.

In all, about 45 persons including some senior police officials and Tadipatri Congress candidate J C Divakar Reddy received injuries in the violence while one candidate in Chilakaluripet had to run for his life as a mob of TDP men chased him.

For actress Roja, the TDP nominee in Nagari, it was political baptism by fire as her car was stoned by a former TDP MLA''s supporters who were angry at the TDP leadership for giving the ticket to Roja.

There were incidents of arson too that were reported from the towns where the violence occurred and in Tadipatri, the brickbatting TDP and Congress workers took advantage of the situation and wiped away the stocks from a liquor shop that was looted clean.

At the end of the day, the Telugu Desam Party top brass went into a huddle to find ways to stem the rot that has set into the party, once claimed as the epitome of discipline.

Realising that this is no longer so, Naidu admitted as much in Visakhapatnam at a press conference saying that his party workers were ''more disciplined'' than those of other parties.

In fact, a piqued Naidu wanted to know from journalists in Visakhapatnam why they were questioning the TDP on the violence and not the other parties.

There was good reason for the TDP to get worried as a press release from the director general of police late on Wednesday night pointed to more ''action'' by party leaders and workers in other parts of the state.

At Darsi in Prakasam district, TDP nominee Kadiri Babu Rao was dragged out of his vehicle by supporters of former TDP MLA N Papa Rao. The vehicle was then set on fire.

Babu Rao was rescued by policemen who took him to file his nomination.

In Ongole, TDP''s official nominee Sidda Ragahva Rao and his men as well as rebel TDP candidate E Hari Babu came to face to face while filing nominations.

When the police asked Hari Babu and his men to wait, they damaged some furniture at the collectorate but the mob was dispersed after a lathicharge. When the mob gathered again the inspector of police at the spot opened one round of fire.

In Krishna district, TDP followers of the Kapu and Gowda communities clashed in Challapalli village in the Avanigadda sub-division.

13,EC exit poll move has govt in tizzy,"NEW DELHI: The Election Commission on Wednesday asked the government to consider an ordinance to ban opinion and exit polls, triggering concern among law ministry officials about the legal validity of such a move.

The advisory, fortified by an all-party consensus, was being examined by the ministry on the ground that a blanket ban on such polls might run foul of the right to freedom of expression guaranteed by the Constitution.

Attorney-General Soli S Sorabjee is learnt to have been asked to examine the suggestion in the light of relevant constitutional provisions, specifically, Articles 19(1A) and 19(IG).

While 19 (1A) mandates the state to guarantee freedom of expression, 19(1G) deals with the freedom to practice any profession and carry on trade.

14,People will throw out RJD govt: Advani,"JEHANABAD: Amid security on high-alert in the face of the threats by the ultra left outfits - the banned People''s War and Maoist Communist Centre - Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani''s Bharat Uday Yatra on Thursday entered the extremist-hit Jehanabad district where he called upon the people to overthrow the ''ineffective and incompetent'' Rabri Devi ministry.

The massive crowd which has turned up to attend the meetings reflected the people''s indignation against the state government which has failed to deliver the goods, Advani told election rallies at Masaurhi and here before leaving for Gaya.

The state government should change its approach and work for development otherwise people will throw it out, he said.

He urged the people to vote for NDA candidates to ensure their victory in all the 40 Lok Sabha seats in Bihar to help return of Atal Bihari Vajpayee for making India a developed nation.

Official sources said Advani''s yatra passed through the district without any problem.

Addressing public meetings in Gaya and Nawada before entering Jharkhand, Advani castigated the Congress for using the minorities merely as its vote bank.

He alleged that the Congress had done nothing for the minorities in the country.

Advani claimed that the Vajpayee ministry during its six year rule had tried to dispel the sense of insecurity among the minorities.

Enumerating the achievements of his government, Advani asked the people to vote for the NDA in the interest of the country. ""We want to make India a developed nation for which people''s cooperation is solicited"".

Later, he proceeded to Hazaribagh in Jharkhand where the Deputy Prime Minister was scheduled to address an election meeting to canvass support for minister for External Affairs Yashwant Sinha.
