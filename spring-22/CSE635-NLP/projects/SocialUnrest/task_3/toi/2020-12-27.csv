0,"Petty politics, not SIT, behind raid","MUMBAI: A midnight knock at the home of the driver of the nephew of a top politician who has just stepped down as deputy chief minister in the wake of a scam.

The police find currency notes totalling lakhs and a licenced pistol, but are tightlipped about the operation. The news has all the makings of a juicy story, but it turns out to be a rather tame affair.

The only significant thing about the Thursday night search at the Mazgaon home of Nilesh Sahu, driver and confidant of Sameer Bhujbal, nephew of deposed deputy chief minister Chhagan Bhujbal, was that it was the handiwork of Shiv Sena MLA and former minister of state for home, Bala Nandgaonkar.

Mr Nandgaonkar had phoned a top police officer and told him that there were â€œsome suspicious objectsâ€™â€™ being stored at an apartment in Mazgaon. â€œMr Nandgaonkar just gave me the address in Mazgaon,â€™â€™ said Additional director-general (law and order) Rahul Gopal.

According to him, the MLA claimed that his activists had given him the information. Mr Gopal communicated it to the state police control room and instructed the staff to alert zonal deputy police commissioner Ashok Dongre.

Mr Sahu, who is also an NCP activist, said 15 officers from the Byculla police station began searching his flat well past Thursday midnight. He alleged that the police did not carry search orders.

â€œWe opposed the search, but the police didnâ€™t even let us make a phone call. Later, they called me to the police station to record my statement,â€™â€™ he said.

The search did not yield any stock of narcotics, as was suspected. However, the police found Rs 3.6 lakhs in cash and a licenced pistol in the flat.Mr Sahu claimed the cash was part of the funds collected for the all-India kabbadi competition which began at Shivaji Park on Saturday.

A top city police official said they were not conducting further inquiries since the search did not yield anything.

He confirmed that the tip-off came from Mr Nandgaonkar but refused to speculate on the motive of the complaint, except that it was â€œmischief â€™â€™. Mr Sahu said Mr Nandgaonkar had made a false complaint to harass him.

â€œI have informed NCP city unit president Sachin Ahir. I also tried to meet DCP Dongre on Saturday,â€™â€™ he added. Mr Bhujbal and Mr Nandgaonkar are arch rivals in the politically sensitive Mazagon area.

The Sena MLAâ€™s tip-off to the police is seen by Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) activists as an attempt to embarrass Mr Bhujbal who is already facing the heat in the multicrore fake stamp paper scam. However, Mr Nandgaonkar has denied tipping-off the police.

â€œI did not make any phone call to Mr Gopal. I do not know if anybody else called the police using my name. I learnt about the search on Friday night.â€™â€™

1,'Tourism policy will rake in moolah',"NEW DELHI: The state government is all set to change the image of Delhi from a transit point for tourists to a tourist destination soon.

The new tourism policy, which will be unveiled in the near future, includes the construction of two new Dilli Haats, restoration of 100 heritage sites, and private participation in construction of budget hotels.

â€˜â€˜We will construct one Dilli Haat in Pitampura in northwest Delhi and another near the socio-cultural centre in Laxmi Nagar in east Delhi.

The department is also preparing a list of about 100 monuments which will be restored and opened to public.â€™â€™ said the newly-appointed Delhi tourism minister Arvinder Singh Lovely.

The heritage buildings under the state government are in a shambles and most of them have either been taken over by encroachers or are home to stray cattle and anti-social elements, rue experts.

In its effort to renovate the cityâ€™s many historical monuments, the tourism department has decided to develop the Mehrauli Heritage Trail as a new tourist destination, as the area has about 50 monuments.

Tourism department officials said that the restoration of dilapidated monuments would only add to new spots and develop Delhi as a â€˜â€˜bigger destinationâ€™â€™ for foreign tourists.

According to Delhi Tourism and Transportation Development Corporation senior officials, opening two new Dilli Haats would not only make the tourists stay longer but also create more opportunities for craftsmen to sell their products and in turn generate more revenue for the local industry, like has been the experience with the first.

â€˜â€˜Moreover, we plan to promote health, spiritual and golf tourism,â€™â€™ added the official. Plans are also afoot to construct a â€˜â€˜tourism clubâ€™â€™ which will provide facilities for sports and recreation.

The new policy will invite private participation in constructing two and three-star hotels for budget tourists. The availability of rooms for tourists in peak season is a major worry for Delhi Tourism and Transportation Development Corporation which does not have a hotel of its own.

2,BJP squirms at minister's faux pas on national anthem,"KOLKATA: There were raised eyebrows as Union small scale industries minister C.P. Thakur referred to the national anthem Jana Gana Mana as a composition by Bankim Chandra Chottapadhyay at a function on Saturday. His deputy Tapan Sikdar gently reminded him that it was Rabindranath Tagore.

Thakur, who is also in charge of the North Eastern states, was addressing a public function organised by Nikhil Bharat Banga Sahitya Sammilan at Salt Lake Stadium. Apart from Sikdar, state transport minister Subhas Chakraborty and mayor Subrata Mukherjee were also present. Thakur said that the Centre had taken a policy decision to give more importance to regional languages and the Centre is ready to work jointly with the state government to propagate Bengali.

Deploring the fact that the language had long been neglected, despite being widely-spoken, Chakraborty said that his government was trying to ensure that maximum official work was done in Bengali. â€œWe have been slow in introducing Bengali in official work, but we will soon be able to introduce it in full scale,â€� he said. Subrata Mukherjee assured that he too would ensure the use of Bengali as an official language in the Kolkata Municipal Corporation.

3,Plea for fair govt deal to homoeopathy,"PATNA: The seventh all-India Homoeopathic Medical Congress began here on Saturday with participants underlining the importance of this stream of medicare for a country like India.

Inaugurating the three-day event, organised by Indian Homoeopathic Organisation (IHO), minister Abdul Bari Siddiqui expressed his happiness at the choice of Bihar as the venue for the convention. He said homoeopathy came to our country from outside but has become more popular here than even the place where it originated. He suggested that IHO should take steps to prevent quacks from duping innocent people.

Minister Awadh Bihari Choudhary, in his speech, said homoeopathy is convenient as it does not prescribe medical tests. He also released the IHO souvenir of 2003 on the occasion.

IHO national general secretary Mahesh Prasad rued the unfair deal to homoeopathy in the country. He said there is a need to open at least five homoeopathic colleges in Bihar. â€œThe facilities in the existing colleges also need to be improved,â€� he added.

Former state home secretary Jiya Lal Arya, IHO national president Dr SP Chakraborty, IHO national working president Dr TK Chatterjee and IHO state president Dr Vidya Singh were also present on the occasion.

4,"Make 1984 riots part of Ardas, says Dal Khalsa","CHANDIGARH: The Dal Khalsa has demanded that 1984 events against the Sikhs be incorporated in the daily â€œardasâ€� of the Sikhs.

In a resolution adopted at the Fatehgarh Sahib â€œJor Mela,â€� the party observed that atrocities perpetrated on the Sikhs during Operation Bluestar and the anti-Sikh riots in 1984 should also be made part of the daily prayers, lest the coming generations forget the two tragic events.

Party general secretary, Kanwar Pal Singh Bittu, said here on Saturday that paintings and pictures depicting the two horrendous events be put up in the Sikh museum and made part of the Sikh heritage.

The Dal Khalsa objected to the increasing influence of migrant labour from other states and the possibility of the POTA being used against the Sikhs. The party resolved to observe February 15 as â€œfateh divasâ€� when a Sikh warrior Baghel Singh unfurled the Sikh flag at the Red Fort in 18th century.

5,Cambridge changed its rules for Ramanujam,"LUCKNOW: â€œSriniwas Ramanujam, the mathematics genius of India, was the first and only person in the history for whom the Cambridge University amended its constitution and awarded him a BA degree on the basis of his research on mathematics, so that he could be made a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRA), the highest honour a mathematician could dream of.â€�

This was disclosed by former vice-chancellor of Lucknow and Jaipur Universities and general secretary Indian Mathematical Society (IMS), while paying glowing tributes to Ramanujam, at a symposium organised on life and works of Ramanujam during the 69th annual conference of the IMS here at the department of mathematics and astronomy, Lucknow University, on Saturday.

Prof RS Agarwal said that Ramanujam was born in a lower middle class family. His father was a clerk and he, too, after intermediate joined as a clerk in the Port Trust of India. However, during his studies he came across Prof Carrâ€™s â€˜Synopsis of Mathematicsâ€™ which generated his interest in the subject. Ramanujamâ€™s superiors complained about his â€˜extra-curricularâ€™ activities to the owner of the port Sir Spencer. When Sir Spencer enquired about and found out that what Ramanujam had â€˜scribbledâ€™ on hundreds of papers was actually mathematical research, he arranged for a scholarship of Rs 75 for Ramanujam to help him study in the Cambridge University.

A genius of mathematics, Ramanujam, however, could not clear other subjects in BA. For his research work Ramanujam was selected for FRA, but without a graduation degree he was not eligible for the honour. That is when the Cambridge University changed its rules, Prof Agarwal said. Unfortunately, Ramanjuam died in 1920 at an early age of 32 soon after his return from England.

Prominent among others who spoke on the occasion were Prof S Bhargava, Mysore, Prof AJ Agarwal, Chandigarh, Prof MA Pathan, AMU and Prof SA Ali, Lucknow.

6,Congress women asked to strengthen party,"LUCKNOW: Delhi chief minister Shiela Dixit on Saturday said that political priorities of the BJP had weakened the nation, conveying a wrong message all around. â€œPolitics,â€� she said, â€œdid not mean that we should rake up mandir and masjid issues all the time while leaving crucial issues on the backburner.â€�

Speaking at the Mahila Congress Workersâ€™ conference at Sahkarita Bhawan, the Delhi chief minister said that the NDA government used all its might to overthrow the Congress regime but was unable to do so because of workersâ€™ resolve and pace of development set by her government. If the BJP could be defeated in Delhi where it had established a firm root, she said, the Congressmen should not be unduly perturbed over the drubbing the party received in the three states that went to the polls along with the national capital.

But for return of the Congress at the centre-stage of national politics, Mahila Congress workers would be required to convince women about the necessity to remove the NDA regime, Shiela Dixit said, adding that this would also save the people from miseries. Dixit said that after the Gujarat poll verdict, it looked as if the Congress would be routed elsewhere but in the Himachal Pradesh assembly polls, the party won convincingly. The Congress still had a chance to defeat the BJP but this could be possible only if the Congressmen worked hard, she said.

Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee president Jagdambika Pal said that the Congress always cared for welfare of women. He said that recent victories in the three states had given the BJP misplaced confidence which would bring only discomfort to the party at the time of the coming parliamentary polls. The victories for the BJP in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh did not mean that the party was slated to win the parliamentary polls, said the UPCC president.

The government which was unable to fix support price for cane had no right to rule the nation, said Pal. He said the Congress president was among the first to have supported the idea of 33 per cent reservation for women in parliament and state legislatures.

On this occasion, the Mahila Congress asked the government to spell out its priorities towards women and also set up a mahila ayog. Mahila Congress leaders sought the help of MPs present on the dais to compel the government to enact laws in favour of women.

AICC leader Newal Kishore Sharma felt that the Congress would not gain strength unless its women wing became active. He said the Congressmen should not be despondent over results of the assembly polls.

8,NGOs blame parties for riots,"HYDERABAD: Seven voluntary organisations in the city, which formed a fact finding team to report on the December 6 violence in the Old City have blamed political parties for the riots.

Addressing a press conference here on Saturday, the team comprising the members of Confederation Of Voluntary Associations, Human Rights Forum, Coalition for Peace and Harmony, Sakshi Human Rights Watch, National Campaign on Dalit Human Rights and Anveshi said while one party observed a protest day the other celebrated it as a â€˜Showrya Divasâ€™.

Police intelligence has failed to understand the tense situation and the lurking fear that was looming in Old City at least 15 days prior to the Black Day., they said The police pickets should not have been withdrawn at 6 pm on the Black Day and firing without proper assessment, supervision and guidance by a superior officer worsened the situation, they said. It said neither the district administration nor the police could effectively negate the spreading rumours and restore confidence in people.

The two earlier commissions Krishna Rao commission and Ramana Chary commission, who made suggestions to improve the situation in the Old City should be examined and implemented, they said.

The team also said the government should pay at least Rs 2 lakh compensation each to the dependents of the persons killed in the violence..

9,New TV channels to cash in on polls,"HYDERABAD: Elections are round the corner and itâ€™s boom time for the media. To cash in on this glut of news, the city is about to see the launch of three new Telugu TV channels which will beam news 24x7.

How these channels, likely to be floated in the new year,will do after the polls are over, is in the realm of speculation. But for now, the planners are sure theyâ€™ll catch the eyeballs and rake in the moolah, especially since the elections are round the bend.

â€œThe plan is to make use of the viewer base we create during the election coverage. Thereâ€™s no other way, at least in the immediate future, for the channels to garner revenues other than through advertisements. Though some channels would get converted into paid channels in future, their immediate survival will decide their future business model,â€� an industry source said.

The three new channels from the city â€” TV9, ETV News and Satya TV â€” say theyâ€™re sure theyâ€™ll cater well to the stateâ€™s viewership base of 8 lakh or more.

At present, much of the revenue is likely to be advertisement-based and election-related.

â€œWe have to see how the ad flow goes once the assembly polls are over.A TV news channel needs an investment upward of Rs 15 crore to 20 crore, and if ads donâ€™t come, the channels can survive only by including entertainment programmes into their scheme of things and selling slots to private producers,â€� the source said.

A Krishna Prasad, MD, TV9 is positive that his vernacular news channel can ride out the choppy market conditions. TV9 has also tied up with cable operators for live coverage of locality news. â€œSuch news capsules and updates will always have a market in AP. We have around 200 professionals, who will work on political and development stories round the clock. The viewersâ€™ psyche of surfing channels for updates on stories is the catch here,â€� Prasad said.

But industry experts claim that once the polls are over, the ads to the vernacular news channel could dry up. In such an eventuality, they might be forced to squeeze in some entertainment programmes.

Whether there is a market here for news channels or not, the players are pinning hopes on the forthcoming elections to gain viewership and the back up of advertisements which will be a key revenue source. Arindam

10,TDP asks cadre to gear up for joint polls,"HYDERABAD: The TDP politburo on Saturday discussed at length the possibility of early Parliament elections and the likelihood of the Assembly polls being clubbed with it.

Later, it gave a call to its party cadre to be prepared for such an eventuality. At a press briefing after the politburo meet, party leaders clarified that they were yet to receive any official word from the BJP on early Lok Sabha polls. But the signals from the Centre seemed to strongly indicate such a possibility.

Chances are that the Lok Sabha would be dissolved sometime soon after the BJP national executive in the city on January 11, the leaders said.

At the politburo meet, the TDP leaders said if the NDA government actually dissolved the House, chances of elections to the Assembly being held in March looked bleak. This would need a relook at the party strategy, for this might pose a new problem of double-incumbency.

The leaders felt that there was no need for the Lok Sabha to go in for a vote-on-account budget before dissolution.

The President has special powers to authorise the government to spend as a caretaker government. Similarly, in the state too, the governor can authorise the state. Which means that no Presidentâ€™s rule is necessary here.

Asked if the TDP favoured simultaneous polls, senior leader Umareddy Venkatesvarulu said his party still believed that the two elections would be held separately. â€œBut we decided to be prepared for simultaneous polls. We wonâ€™t object to early Lok Sabha elections.â€�

11,Turkish law creates hurdles for exporters,"NEW DELHI: Health certifications for sewing machines, washing machines, electric switches or stainless steel cutlery?

With Turkey imposing a legislation making a health certification necessary for all appliances intended to be used by humans, even an electric switch or a washing machine would require a health certification for exports, official sources said.

As per the new law, all exporters are required to furnish a health clearance certificate for exports of food, human and veterinary drugs, medical equipment and all appliances intended to be used by humans.

Questioning the logic behind such a certification, exporters say this move was nothing but another non-tariff barrier aimed at creating hurdles for exports.

They say such a certification will not just consume time but also lead to increase in costs which will be detrimental for small exporters in a highly competitive environment.

Exporters said while such a certification is understandable for food items, medicines and medical equipment, its extension to appliances which are intended for human use is difficult to understand.

Government is yet to take up the matter with Turkey which notified the legislation in September.

12,Illegal use of cancer drug under govt scanner,"NEW DELHI: The government has been examining the reports of Letrozole, an anti-cancer drug, being tried illegally on women for curing infertility. It will take the required action against the offenders, health ministry sources said.

However, the sources said the ministry had not yet received a formal complaint in the matter. Over 400 women were allegedly being used as guinea pigs by some researchers to test Letrozole. The clinical trials allegedly took place at private clinics in Delhi, Nagpur, Hyderabad, Kolkata and Jodhpur without the permission of the drug controller general of India.

Based on these trials, pharmaceutical companies were promoting this drug for ovulation induction, Dr C M Gulati, former WHO drug expert and editor of the Monthly Index of Medical Specialities, said.

The government should have initiated legal action against the people concerned, Gulati said, adding that conducting clinical trials without the overnmentâ€™s approval was a criminal offence. Even promotion of a drug for a purpose for which it is not meant for was a criminal offence, he said.

However, he maintained that the incident could not be called a case of clinical trial. It was only â€˜â€˜off-labelâ€™â€™ use. â€˜â€˜We have already sensitised the industry to prevent off-label use of the drug,â€™â€™ Kumar said adding, â€˜â€˜Researchers have used a drug for a purpose for which it is not approved in their own capacity in their clinics.â€™â€™

13,'Heritage walk' to wake Gujarat ministers up,"AHMEDABAD: It is punishment for late risers in the Modi government. Officials can be seen braving the chilly winter morning and walking down the streets of old Ahmedabad. This is the â€˜Heritage Walkâ€™, which takes one through narrow alleys and architectural hot-spots in the city.

Actually, it is a nice walk for those accustomed to getting up early in the morning. For those who need several cups of tea before they stir up, it is sheer torture. The culture department is monitoring the heritage walkers and shirkers. â€˜â€˜Main to danda le kar iske peeche pada hoon (I am aggressively pursuing this matter),â€™â€™ says state cultural secretary, Varun Maira.

A circular issued by the culture secretary says, â€˜â€˜All ministers and government officials will have to participate in the heritage walk.â€™â€™ Officials and ministers from departments like Forest and PWD have already undertaken this walk from Swaminarayan Temple in Kalupur to Manek Chowk. The walk began at 8 am and ended at 10.30 am. It has been planned to sensitise people to the issue of heritage conservation.

â€˜â€˜Over 1,200 people have participated in the walk this year. Directing officials to take the walk is an encouraging move, from the state government, because most people tend to take the city they live in for granted,â€™â€™ says Debashish Naik of Ahmedabad Municipal Corporationâ€™s Heritage Cell.

Maira says, â€˜â€˜The idea behind the circular is to sensitise the ministers and officials of other departments to the issues of heritage and conservation. This is basically to ensure that next time when these departments are confronted with heritage issues, they are responsive in their approach.â€™â€™

So, if the forest department team led by minister Mangubhai Patel walked on September 29, the PWD department was forced to do it on December 24. Sources say though the circular does not explicitly say that taking part in the walk is compulsory, the implementation is being closely monitored. Maira confesses that the issue of whether the heritage walk is compulsory or not had come up. â€˜â€˜It is voluntary, but I am monitoring the response and ensuring that all officials do it,â€™â€™ he said.
