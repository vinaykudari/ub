0,Village bandh turns violent in N Gujarat,"PALANPUR/AHMEDABAD: The â€˜village bandhâ€™ to protest against the increase in power tariff and irrigation cess turned violent on Monday morning when police resorted to lathicharge and lobbed tear gas shells to disperse group of farmers in Gola village, about 33 km from Palanpur.

The bandh, called by the Gujarat Khedut Sangharsh Samiti, had a strong impact in the North Gujarat districts of Sabarkantha and Patan.

However, it failed to create a stir in South Gujarat and Saurashtra. As many as 13 people were injured in the police lathicharge after mobs pelted stones in Gola, while 12 people were arrested.

According to the police, groups of people tried to stall traffic by putting trees on roads and even forced schools and banks to close down.

Normal life in Patan, Sidhpur, Harij and Radhanpur in Patan district, and Palanpur, Deesa, Thara, Dhanera and Ambaji in Banaskantha district came to a standstill, as shopkeepers were forced to down shutters and public transport vehicles remained off the roads.

The bandh had its effect on the market as vegetable prices shot up in North Gujarat districts and milk was sold at a premium. â€œWe got just 3,671 litres of milk as against the daily procurement of 4.80 lakh litres that we get from 1,250 villages every day,â€� said Banas Dairy managing director S S Chaudhary.

However, the bandh had just a partial effect in Surat, affecting only the supply of green vegetables. Only about 50 trucks off-loaded their goods in the APMC market at Sahara Darwaja on Monday as against 300 on normal day.

Heavy police bandobast was made near the APMC market and no untoward incident was reported, according to police officials.

However, the entire market complex wore deserted look. According to Ichhapore Khedut Samaj office-bearer Janak Patel, only those trucks, which were coming from outside the state, were allowed to enter the market. The bandh also failed to have an effect in Saurashtra with marketing yards at Amreli, Bhavnagar, Jamnagar, Junagadh, Surendranagar, and Rajkot remaining open. Gujarat Khedut Sangharsh Samiti convenor Bipin Desai said that the village bandh programme was effective and peaceful, and thanked farmers for their total support to the call.

State BJP president Rajendrasinh Rana, however, described the bandh programme as a total failure, as flow of commodities like milk and vegetables continued into the cities.

1,'Discipline must in any party',"BANGALORE: Urban development minister D.K. Shivakumar on Monday justified the expulsions of Congress members who reportedly indulged in anti-party activities during the Legislative Council elections.

â€œNo party can hope to survive without discipline. See what the BJP has been reduced to? Or take the JD which was once in power, but is now splintered into so many groups. We have learnt valuable lessons from them,â€™â€™ he declared.

Shivakumar agreed the problem began with selection of candidates. â€œWhere nominations are concerned, there is always difference of opinion. There is no way any party can satisfy everybody. I do not want to go into the merits or demerits of the method of selection, but discipline is something which is very necessary.â€™â€™

On reports that other parties might be engineering dissidence leading to the expulsions, the minister said: â€œNobody can destabilise the Congress; it is the Congress which can destabilise others through its programmes and policies. These leaders just wanted political rehabilitation,â€™â€™

When pointed out that MP and senior leader C.K. Jaffer Sharief had also been critical of the leadership and government, Shivakumar said the two issues are different. â€œWhat he has questioned is the working of the party, which is an internal matter. But he has never resorted to anti-party activities like these expelled leaders have done.â€™â€™

2,Sharma's arrest is not enough: Sena-BJP,"MUMBAI: Following former city police commissioner R.S. Sharmaâ€™s arrest on Monday, the opposition Shiv Sena-BJP plans to step up its campaign against deputy chief minister Chhagan Bhujbal in the run-up to the state legislature session in Nagpur.

Maharashtra BJP president Gopinath Munde made a full-throated demand for action against Sharmaâ€™s â€œpolitical mastersâ€™â€™.

Speaking to this newspaper from Parli in Beed district on Monday, Mr Munde named a â€œpowerfulâ€™â€™ minister in the DF government who, he alleged, had offered patronage to scamster Abdul Karim Telgi.

â€œTelgi was kept out of jail for 85 days by the police. This special favour was arranged by a powerful DF minister who should be questioned on the matter,â€™â€™ Mr Munde said.

â€œHow did Telgi, who was supposed to be under arrest, stay in a south Mumbai flat for 85 days? Whose idea was it to keep him out of prison? Under whose orders were the police acting when they allowed Telgi to escape from jail? What was the quid pro quo? These questions need to be thoroughly probed,â€™â€™ he added.

Echoing identical views, leader of the opposition Nitin Gadkari said Sharmaâ€™s arrest was not enough. â€œThere is sufficient ground to prove that Sharma operated at the behest of a powerful minister in the DF government. Unless that minister is interrogated, the complete truth will not come out,â€™â€™ Mr Gadkari maintained.

3,State bandh passes off peacefully,"PATNA: The statewide bandh against the killing of Biharis in Assam evoked partial response on Monday and passed off peacefully here. The bandh call had been given by the Indian Federal Democratic Party (IFDP).

Most of the shops remained closed as party activists and students tried to enforce bandh in different parts of the city. At least 400 youths, students and IFDP president and MP Pappu Yadav were arrested during the bandh in Patna district.

Rail traffic was hit with several trains being detained by bandh supporters at various places in the state.

Home commissioner B K Haldar said that there was â€œno impactâ€� of the bandh in Bihar.

In Patna, shops opened in the late afternoon and evening. Vehicular traffic was affected in the forenoon near the Dak Bungalow crossing, Kargil Chowk, Gandhi Maidan and other places in the city.

The police arrested Pappu Yadav near Kargil Chowk and about 60 bandh supporters near the Dak Bungalow crossing.

Those arrested were detained at DAV School, Danapur and they were later released.

A good number of schools remained closed while those open did not ply their buses.

The IFDP spokesperson claimed the bandh was peaceful. He alleged that party workers were beaten up by the police at Danapur. Members of the All Bihar Studentsâ€™ Union (ABSU) took out a procession on Old Bypass Road in the Kankerbagh area. An ABSU release claimed that the police lathicharged the processionists, which the district administration denied, though. Another group of ABSU members demonstrated at the Dak Bungalow crossing and courted arrest.

Meanwhile, according to an East-Central Railway press release bandh supporters squatted on rail tracks delaying the movement of the Down Toofan Express, Down Gulzarbagh-Buxar DMU, Up Patna-Buxar DMU and Up Patna-Buxar EMU at Ara.

4,Sharma's arrest shocks police force,"MUMBAI: Former Mumbai police commissioner Ranjit Singh Sharma was arrested on Monday evening for conniving with the prime accused in the fake stamp scam, Abdul Karim Telgi.

Complimenting the SIT for its commendable job, state director general of police S.M. Shangari said Sharmaâ€™s arrest would not affect the morale of the police.Mumbai police commissioner P.S. Pasricha said the law would take its own course. â€œOne feels sad that the person who had held the prestigious post of Mumbai police commissioner has been arrested. But I will ensure that this does not affect the morale of the police force.

I am taking measures to improve the image of the Mumbai police.â€™â€™

â€œSharmaâ€™s arrest follows the SITâ€™s investigations which are being conducted under the supervision of the Bombay high court. The state government has no role in this and it would be improper on my part to comment on the arrest,â€™â€™ Maharashtra chief minister Sushilkumar Shinde said on Monday.

Mr Sharma,who belongs to the 1968 batch of the elite Indian Police Service (IPS), is the seniormost police officer to be arrested in the scam.He has been booked under Sections 4 and 24 (conniving with an organised crime syndicate) of MCOCA.He has been accused of going slow on the investigations against Telgi when he was joint commissioner (crime) in Mumbai in 1995 and later as Pune commissioner in 2002.

On November 7, the SIT had arrested inspector general Shridhar Wagal of state intelligence in the case for conniving with Telgi when he was chief of the Mumbai crime branch.

Mr Sharmaâ€™s arrest on Monday sent shockwaves among the 39,000-strong Mumbai police. He was the cityâ€™s police commissioner between January 1 and November 16 this year.

The SIT has accused Sharma of conniving with Telgi and going slow on the investigations against him in Pune in 2002. The SIT had on November 12 submitted a report against Sharma before the Bombay high court, citing nine acts of omission and commission.

The court had directed chief minister Sushilkumar Shinde to take action on that report. The state has ordered a departmental inquiry against Sharma and had served him a show-cause notice three days before his retirement.

5,High turnout for Council elections,"LUCKNOW: Altogether 97 per cent voters cast their votes in the biennial election for 35 Vidhan Parishad seats from local bodies constituencies in the state.

The polling, by and large, passed off peacefully with minor skirmishes reported from some parts of the state.

However, about a dozen legislators could not cast their votes as their names were removed from the electoral rolls following a directive from the Election Commission, disallowing ex-office members from casting votes.

The UPCC president Jagdambika Pal, whose name did not figure in the electoral roll in the Basti-Siddharthanagar constituency, accused the returning officer of deliberately deleting his name from the votersâ€™ list.

His complaint, said an official of the EC, has been referred to the district magistrate. The polling began on a dull note in the morning and by noon it was around 40 per cent in most of the districts. It, however, picked up later.

According to official information, in Lucknow-Unnao, Hardoi, Pratapgrh, Kheri, Lalitpur-Jhansi, Sitapur and Rae Bareli, more than 98 per cent voters had cast their votes. The EC was still awaiting reports from some of the districts, said chief electoral officer Vijay Sharma.

Repolling in a few booths, said Sharma, could not be ruled out though any decision in this regard would be taken only after reports of the returning officers along with those of observers were looked into by the EC.

The counting of votes would start on December 3.

7,BJP calls for re-election,"LUCKNOW: Charging the state election commission of working under the influence of the Mulayam government, the BJP on Monday demanded repolling in over a dozen seats of UP Council for local bodies and counting under the supervision of observers from outside UP.

The counting is scheduled to be held on December 3.

Party state chief Vinay Katiyar alleged that officials on poll duty acted as Samajwadi Party â€˜agentsâ€™ during the polls on Monday at many places.

â€œWhile goons of ruling coalition were capturing booths one after another, officials remained mute spectator and at few places they were seen helping them out,â€� he charged.

Katiyar claimed that booths were captured, ballot papers snatched and bogus voting was allowed in Ferozabad, Mainpuri, Saharanpur, Sitapur, Hardoi, Kanpur, Varanasi, Lucknow and several other places. â€œIn Saharanpur, an ADM was caught helping the ruling party candidate,â€� he alleged.

â€œIn Karhal and few other polling booths, BJP voters were not allowed to cast their franchise, while in Lucknow vote of one Jagdish, who was outside the country, was allowed to be cast by ruling party supporters. In Jhansi, a ruling party minister was openly intimidating BJP voters. Despite all this, our complaints were lodged after much persuasion,â€� rued Katiyar.

8,City begins to feel petrol pinch,"HYDERABAD: With talks between petroleum companies and the Hyderabad and Rangareddy Petroleum Tanker Ownersâ€™ Association failing to make any headway here on Monday, petroleum tanker owners have decided to continue their indefinite strike.

However, with the general public unaware of the developments and with uncertainty still continuing over the strike, long queues started building up at some petrol pumps in the city. There were even isolated reports of over pricing and rationing in certain retail outlets in the city.

â€œFor 20 litres of petrol, I was charged Rs 768, which comes to Rs 38.4 per litre. This is nothing short of daylight robbery,â€� said four-wheeler owner M Rao, who filled petrol at a pump near Bowenpally.

Two-wheeler owner K K Reddy said petrol pump owners were rationing fuel and refused to give more than two litres to two-wheelers.

No shortage of fuel was reported from retail petroleum outlets in the city and the stocks are expected to last for at least another four days.

â€œSenior officials of petroleum companies came here from Chennai for talks but they have not agreed to our demands,â€� Association president Syed Habeeb Ali said.

Meanwhile, rumours are doing the rounds that the strike could be called off soon as a section of tanker owners are maintaining that they are not on strike but were just delaying renewal of their contracts with the companies.

The contracts of most tanker owners are due for renewal. The sudden change in stand is apparently under pressure from oil giants.

Ali said: â€œWe had two sittings with the representatives of the oil companies, including Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited, Indian Oil Company and Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited, but the talks were inconclusive.â€�

Tanker owners have put forth a list of demands, including full reimbursement of road tax, permission to run tankers older than 15 years, increasing tanker charges per trip and timely payment of bills.

â€œWe have agreed to most of the demands but asked for three weeks time, which the tanker owners are not willing to concede,â€� senior HPCL regional manager D K Patnaik, who represented the company in the talks, said.

However, the association representatives said the managements were not willing to withdraw the 30 per cent cut which they had effected on tanker charges.

Though no talks are scheduled for Tuesday, both sides have maintained that they were open for talks. The state government is keeping a close watch on the developments.

Though the government is not in the picture with regard to the strike, the civil supplies department officials are coordinating with the association and oil companies to end the impasse.

In the event of the strike going beyond that period, the department plans to press its own tankers into service. The civil supplies corporation has over 100 tankers and these would be used for transporting the fuel, an official said.

9,Two arrested in hit-and-run,"Hyderabad: The police on Monday arrested two young men, who were travelling in the Maruti van which knocked down a police constable at Bowenpally on Thursday night.

The arrested persons have been identified as K Rajesh, 25 and G Srinivas â€” both residents of Goutamnagar in Balanagar. Rajesh worked as a mechanic and Srinivas was a milk vendor. The Maruti van involved in the hit-and-run has been recovered.

Police said that around 10 pm on Thursday, the men picked up two prostitutes and took them to an isolated place in Kompally. They also reportedly consumed liquor there.

The four were returning to the city when the incident happened and Rajesh was at the wheel at the time. They saw a temporary police check-point in front of Autofin Limited on the Medchal road.

Policemen were searching all vehicles as part of a special drive to check crime in the city. It was around 11.30 pm and they were afraid of being caught with prostitutes, police said. Srinivas reportedly panicked and asked Rajesh not to stop the vehicle.

The vehicle crashed through the check-point and hurtled forward. Another check-point had been set up a little ahead. One of the constables, G Malakondal Rao, tried to stop the vehicle, but was knocked down.

The van dragged him for nearly half a kilometre. The constable broke his leg and seven ribs. His colleagues rushed him to hospital.

Police officers tailed the van for some distance in their vehicles. But the duo managed to shake them off. However, officers had noted down the licence plate number of the vehicle. They radioed the number and the description of the vehicle to the control room.

Police units swung into action and a lookout was issued for the vehicle. They finally traced the duo to their hideout in Chintal on Monday morning and arrested them.

A police officer said the condition of the constable has improved. The department would reimburse his medical expenses, he added. Meanwhile, the police commissioner has announced a reward of Rs 2,000 for the constable for his courage.

10,"'Krishna, Poojary have no time for partymen'","BANGALORE: On the eve of the Council elections, former Congress MP from Belgaum S.B. Sidnal resigned from the party on Sunday, accusing chief minister S.M. Krishna and KPCC president B. Janardhana Poojary of â€œignoring loyal party workers.â€™â€™

Speaking to The Times of India from Belgaum, Sidnal said: â€œI tolerated this for four-and-a-half years. People who came from Janata Dal have become ministers or the Upper House chairman, but loyal workers like us have been ignored.â€™â€™

Sidnal clarified that heâ€™s not against people joining the Congress. â€œThey can work in the party, but not overtake us.â€™â€™

Stating that he had joined the Congress in 1958, Sidnal said both Krishna and Poojary are indifferent to party workers. â€œPoojary shouts at workers in the open meeting, while Krishna has no time to hear us.â€™â€™ Further, Poojary is expelling people â€œleft, right and centreâ€™â€™. â€œPoojary lost elections thrice and now has gained backdoor entry to become KPCC president.â€™â€™

Reacting to Sidnalâ€™s outburst, Poojary said the formerâ€™s son is a functionary in Vijay Sankeswarâ€™s Kannada Nadu Party. â€œSidnal is also planning to join him. If he wants to do so, let him leave the Congress graciously.â€™â€™

On the fact heâ€™s riding roughshod over workers, Poojary said: â€œI have been holding meetings and hear workersâ€™ grievances up to 4 am. His grouse is just a pretext to leave the party.â€™â€™

11,Congress stakes high in today's Council polls,"BANGALORE: All parties will face the acid test on Monday in elections to 25 seats in the Legislative Council from the local authorities constituencies.

The Congress is contesting 23 of the 25 seats with JD(S) and AIPJD 18 each and BJP 11. Of the 25 seats, five districts of Mysore, Belgaum, Bijapur, Dakshina Kannada and Dharwad are â€œdouble seatâ€™â€™ constituencies, where two members are elected from each district.

Among the 25 MLCs retiring on January 5, 2004, two are ministers â€” Basavaraj Patil Humnabad and T. John, besides 11 other Congress, two BJP and 10 Janata Parivar members.

Counting of votes will be on December 3.

Intensive campaigning was undertaken by all parties, but stakes are high for the ruling Congress, which not only has to retain 13 seats but annex a few more. KPCC president B. Janardhana Poojary, who went on a blitzkrieg campaign covering all districts, also took action against members indulging in â€œanti-party activities.â€™â€™

Nearly a dozen members were expelled, including former ministers, for defying the party diktat. The latest expulsion of senior Bidar party man Bheemanna Khandre and his two sons has created a flutter in the party.

Sources said Khandre was working for Congress rebel candidate Baburao Gudge, who has been â€œadoptedâ€™â€™ by JD(S) and given the â€˜Bâ€™ form for the seat. The Congress official candidate is minister Humnabad.

Incidentally, all those expelled belong to the prominent Lingayat community. But sources said: â€œThe party is only trying another Lingayat, who is the official candidate in Bidar.â€™â€™

To substantiate their claim, sources said in Belgaum, former minister Mallarigouda Patil was expelled since he tried to sabotage prospects of the candidate, Mahantesh Kavatagimath.

Reacting to his expulsion, Khandre, in a press statement, said: â€œI was surprised and shocked when I came to know through the media that my two sons and I have been expelled from the Congress for six years on false allegations of anti-party activities by persons of vested interest who want to see us out of the party.â€™â€™

Khandre alleged that he had been in Bangalore from over one month to set up the Mahatma Gandhi cooperative sugar factory in Bhalki. â€œMy detractors are in my own party, for their selfish gains, and overlooking problems of farmers and share-holders of factories. They took this opportunity to victimise me and my sons on baseless grounds.â€™â€™

Poojary, on the other hand, said he had no option but to expel Khandre as he received reports of him working against Humnabad. â€œI have the highest respect for Khandre, who ensured Humnabadâ€™s sonâ€™s victory in the recent bypoll. Even today, if he tells me that he is working for Humnabad, I will revoke his expulsion.â€™â€™
