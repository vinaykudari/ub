0,Princes and the parivar,"NEW DELHI: Poll pundits predict BJP victories in Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Rajasthan and the tribal belts of Chhattisgarh and Orissa. The BJP''s stranglehold in these areas is often ascribed to the penetration of the RSS and its offshoots like Vanvasi Kalyan Ashram, Vishwa Hindu Parishad and Bharatiya Kisan Sangh.

The RSS network in this region, though strong, is not the only reason for the BJP''s phenomenal growth. The RSS pracharaks worked on the credibility and feudal edifice lent to them by the former rulers who promoted the Bharatiya Jan Sangh (BJS) and the BJP.

Without Dilip Singh Judeo and his father''s active participation there would have been no Vanvasi Kalyan Ashram in Jashpur. The tribal belt is dotted by rulers and jagirdars who were anti-Congress: Bastar, Kanker and Jashpur in Chhattisgarh; Dhenkanal, Kalahandi, Keonjar, Mayurbhanj and Patna in Orissa; Udaipur, Alwar, Bharatpur, Dholpur (Vasundhara Raje is married to this family), Karauli, Dungarpur, Jhalawar, Kota, Jaipur (of the famous Gayatri Devi), Jodhpur, Bikaner and Jaisalmer in Rajasthan. Gwalior, Rewa, Dhar, Narsinghpur, Satna and their jagirdars in MP all lent their princely status to seek votes for the Swatantra Party, BJS and BJP, as did the princelings of Gujarat.

The BJS'' early gains were in MP and largely due to the late Rajmata of Gwalior, Vijayaraje Scindia. When she was in Congress in 1962, BJS had three MPs from the state, but after the anti-Congress Bastar prince''s murder, the tide turned and in 1967 there were seven BJS and six BJS-supported independent MPs.

Vijayaraje''s political advisor Sardar Angre says, ""The RSS made progress entirely because of the so-called Samants. Though ideologically affiliated to the Sangh, most princes were nervous about supporting BJS because of the allegations over Gandhi''s assassination. There was a baseless allegation that the revolver used came from Gwalior. And Swantantra was better funded by Bombay''s industrialists. But Rajmata was braver than the rest and joined Jan Sangh while most others opted for Swantantra"". Ideological distinctions between Swantantra and BJS were blurred. In 1967, Vijayaraje contested for Parliament on a Swatantra ticket and the assembly on a BJS ticket.

Though exonerated in the Gandhi assassination case, Alwar and Bharatpur princes were under a cloud and the Alwar PM N B Khare later became the Hindu Mahasabha president. It would have been natural for the rulers to align with the new power centre, Congress. Yet, many opted for Swatantra. Angre calls Swatantra a ""good stepping stone for rulers and BJS"". His brother-in-law finance minister Jaswant Singh was in Swatantra, a bigger Opposition party than BJS in Rajasthan, Orissa and Gujarat.

Angre is clear that without the princes'' help BJP would never have grown into a ruling party: ""RSS had influence over princes who influenced people and so BJS and BJP became viable alternatives to Congress.""

After Nehru proposed a land ceiling law in 1959, the princes who had their titles, privy purses and land to protect formed the Swatantra Party. It came second in the 1967 LS elections with 44 seats and 8.67% votes, becoming number one in Gujarat (12 seats), Orissa (8) and Mysore (5) and second in Rajasthan (8). After Indira Gandhi nationalised banks and abolished privy purses, Swatantra, BJS, Congress(O) and some socialists formed the Grand Alliance. Of these, only Swatantra fought in Orissa and was ahead of BJS in Rajasthan and Gujarat. In MP alone there were 8 princes under the BJS banner or as BJS-supported independents.

Today, the sangh parivar no longer depends on princes for its survival in these areas. The anti-conversion campaign has acquired its own momentum and, if anything, the Judeos of the area today need the parivar and its ideology to remain politically relevant.

1,NDA govt. let down public sector: Manmohan,"PUNE: Former Union finance minister Manmohan Singh on Friday lashed out at the disinvestment policy of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government at the Centre, saying that it was aimed at â€œdestroying the public sectorâ€�.

He said that the Congress, if elected to power, would revitalise the public sector. The former governor of the Reserve Bank of India, who is credited with initiating economic reforms in the country during his tenure as finance minister between 1991 and 1995, was in Pune to campaign for the party candidate, Suresh Kalmadi.

Addressing a press conference at the Congress Bhavan here, Singh clarified that the Congress was not opposed to the disinvestment policy per se. â€œHowever, the NDAâ€™s policy is scandalous. It has not made any effort to strengthen the public sector, so that it can compete with the private sector,â€� he said.

Singh criticised the Bharatiya Janata Party for the communal violence in Gujarat and said that starvation deaths had increased in the country. â€œThe Congress-led state governments are not being given adequate quota of foodgrains, although grains are perishing in central government godowns,â€� he charged.

He also blamed the NDA government for the multicrore-rupee Unit Trust of India scam and accused it of mismanaging the economy.

Singh said Prime Minister A.B. Vajpayee had no moral right to speak of â€˜India Shiningâ€™ as his own constituency was ranked as the 25th poorest district in the country. Singh said it was the P.V. Narasimha Rao government that deserved credit for the healthy state of foreign reserves in the country and the road works undertaken by the National Highway Authority of India.

2,Three more arrests in paper leak case,"MUMBAI: The Juhu police on Friday arrested the principal of Tardeoâ€™s NSS college, S P Sutar, and two students of Mithibai college, Vinayak Sanil andMohit Chehulkar, in the TYBCOM examination paper leak case.

Police sources said Sutar was held on charges of abetment.

The police have already arrested Prakash Nagaria, a lecturer in NSS college and Mithibai college student Achal Gupta for leaking the final yearâ€™s financial accounting paper twice last month. As a result the examination was cancelled on two occasions and was finally held on April 8.

Police sources said Sutar had entrusted Nagaria to conduct the examinations in their college and collect the sealed question papers dispatched by the university. Nagaria had broken the seal of one of the envelopes and photocopied the question paper before keeping it back.He then leaked the paper to his nephew Gupta, who sold it among his c o l l e g e friends for anywhere between Rs 3,000 to Rs 5,000.

Sanil and Chehulkar purchased the leaked question papers from Gupta and sold it among other students.

Deputy police commissioner Bipinkumar Singh said that university authorises only the principal to conduct examinations and Sutar had violated the rules. Further, he did not initiate any action even after realising that the seal of envelopes containing question papers had been tampered with.

The trio was remanded to police custody. More arrests are likely in thecase.

3,HC sets aside govt order on posting,"PATNA: The Patna HC on Friday set aside government notification/press communique dated June 13, 2003 by which secondary school teachers had been directed to join their original/first place of posting, and allowed the writ petitions challenging the notification.

A division bench comprising Justice Narayan Roy and Justice P K Sinha, which had kept its order reserved on February 11, pronounced the judgement on Friday making the posts of secondary school teachers transferable.

In all, 91 writ petitions had been filed individually and collectively in June 2003, including one filed by Bihar Secondary Teachers'' Association, challenging the government notification.

Earlier, the single bench of Justice Narayan Roy had stayed the government notification on July 7, 2003. On July 17, 2003, the matter was referred to a division bench.

According to government advocate Ashok Kumar Chaudhary, on the basis of the government notification a number of secondary school teachers joined the schools where they had been posted first.

But some of them did not join their first/original place of posting and filed writ petitions in the HC challenging the government notification.

The teachers who had joined their original place of posting and did not want to be transferred, became intervener-petitioners in the matter and took the plea that the government notification should be followed.

The division bench on Friday also quashed the writ petitions of intervener-petitioners.

4,Sinha's 'home ministry' against hubby in politics,"HAZARIBAG: She would rather see her high profile husband play with his grandchildren than shake hands with US foreign secretary Colin Powell.

Nilima, wife of BJP candidate in Hazaribag Yashwant Sinha, believes that if not immediately, then five years on he should retire and make up for the lost time with his family.

Sentiments notwithstanding, Nilima, however, is ready at 9 am giving instructions to party workers on the sprawling campus of her bungalow at Demotar, 8 km from Hazaribag, before she embarks upon the day''s campaigning - seeking votes for her husband.

A subtle transformation takes place in her docile demeanour as soon as she takes up the microphone to address a motley crowd of voters in a field adjacent to the Bhelwar village mosque.

Playing the model Indian wife, Nilima - in a pink and grey cotton saree - braves the scorching April sun and the anger of voters.

""Give us electricity first and only then we shall vote for you,"" says Meera Devi. Bhelwar, comprising 800 houses of Muslims and backward classes, has been a strong vote bank of Sinha.

""Yeh hamari ghar ki baat hai,"" says Mohd Maniruddin Ansari. But despite their loyalty to him, they are not satisfied with his performance.

Least concerned with Indo-Pak relations or President Bush, the villagers rue that the foreign affairs minister has not succeeded in providing them water for irrigation for which 200 acres of land were still barren.

Nilima then explains Prime Minister Vajpayee''s ""bijli, sadak, pani"" scheme to them. ""We need your votes to give you your basic needs,"" she tells them.

Flanked by her daughter Sharmila and a journalist daughter-in law, Nilima then heads for Chapwa and Bhabhawai villages in her white air-conditioned Tata Sierra.

Daughter of a bureaucrat, Nilima had never wanted her IAS husband to give up babudom since she preferred the security of bureaucracy than the uncertainty of politics.

""He resigned in 1984 without telling me,"" she said, recalling she had fought with her husband for taking such a step.

""He has never taken my advice except when there was a proposal to hike prices of LPG cylinders,"" she laughed.

Nilima, however, realises the force of power. Herself an active social worker, she swears she has never misused her husband''s position.

Ahead in Chapwa, she advises voters not to allow wrong people to grab houses under the Indira Awaas Yojna. She also has a strong conviction, as she goes from one village to another, that Sinha would win a record third time from the constituency.

Rejecting the rebel BJP candidate, Mahavir Vishwakarma, she asserts that people would rather send a high profile minister to Parliament than a backbencher.

But only this term - no more elections, is her wishful thinking. Is minister for external affairs listening to his home ministry?

5,"Govt may rig polls in Chhapra, Madhepura: NDA","PATNA: A two-member NDA delegation comprising state JD(U) president Bijendra Prasad Yadav and BJP''s state campaign committee convener Chandramohan Roy met Election Commission''s special poll observer L B Saptarishi and requested him to ensure free and fair Lok Sabha polls in Chhapra and Madhepura constituencies.

Talking to mediapersons state JD(U) spokesman Uday Narayan Chaudhary said the delegation also urged Saptarishi that deployment of Central forces should be done under the direction of concerned Central poll observers and not be left to the state government or district administration.

State JD(U) general secretary Sanjay Verma was also present at the press conference.

Chaudhary said the NDA delegation told Saptarishi that the state government is planning to allow free entry of anti-social elements in good numbers into Chhapra from Gopalganj and Patna and into Madhepura from Khagaria and Purnia districts to capture polling stations and indulge in poll irregularities in order to ensure the victory of RJD supremo Laloo Prasad Yadav, who is contesting from both Chhapra and Madhepura constituencies.

Saptarishi assured the delegation that he would personally supervise poll arrangements in both constituencies and ensure fair elections, adding that he would not allow intimidation of voters by any political party.

Chaudhary claimed that NDA is going to win all the 40 Lok Sabha seats in Bihar since there is mass support in favour of its candidates.

He urged the Election Commission that since all the voters have not been able to get photo-identity cards and the present voters'' list is not complete, the old system of allowing genuine voters to cast their votes should be followed till all the voters do not get PICs.

According to Verma, JD(U) president George Fernandes will address public meetings in Hajipur, Samastipur and Vaishali Lok Sabha constituencies on April 19.

6,Laloo's 'MY' a stepmother: Shahnawaz,"CHHAPRA: Union textiles minister Shahnawaz Hussain, addressing a conference of Saran district minority cell of the BJP here on Wednesday, said the BJP is not a communal party and Muslims are quite safe with the party in power.

""Had it been communal, APJ Abdul Kalam would not have been elected President of India and I would not have become a Central minister,"" he said, adding he sincerely wished to liberate the Muslim brethren from the clutches of RJD.

Hussain said Laloo has become a laughing stock. ""This election is not only a parliamentary election but an election for the end of RJD government from Bihar,"" he said.

Rubbishing the claims of ""MY"" combination, he said Laloo''s ""MY"" (mother) is a stepmother whereas the combination of Shahnawaz and Hukumdeo Narain Yadav is the true ""MY"" equation.

Praising Chhapra candidate Rudy, Shahnawaz said Rudy as civil aviation minister has served minorities so much by providing relief to Haj pilgrims.

Commenting on the posters of semi-dressed Laloo, he said film actresses do it to get publicity and Laloo is following them.

Later talking to media persons, Shahnawaz hoped the NDA would capture more than 35 seats in Bihar and development would be the main issue.

MLAs Binay Kumar Singh and Sigrimal were among those present at the meeting conducted by Saran district minority cell president Irfan.

7,No more stink in Wadala election,"MUMBAI: Wadala voters can breathe easy now. A day after The Times of India reported that election authorities had requisitioned a toilet in the local Banshidhar Aggarwal school for a polling booth, Mumbai city collector Pradeep Vyas inspected the school and withdrew the order.

Earlier on Friday, the school staff was in for a rude shock when around ten election department officials, along with four police officers, came calling.

They asked school staff to open all the classrooms on the ground floor. ""When we refused to open the rooms in the absence of the principal (Ramakant Pandey was in the high court where the matter was listed for hearing.), they threatened to break open the rooms,"" said the school supervisor.

She added that the incident would have taken an ugly turn had the collector not arrived at that time. ""Vyas told the other officials to move out of the premises. He was the only official who revealed his identity,"" said the supervisor.

Later in the day, Vyas told TNN that ""the issue has been resolved."" ""I went to the school today. Later, I had a meeting with Pandey for over an hour. We will now have three polling booths on the ground floor and two on the first. There will be no polling booth in the toilet,"" he said, adding that the toilet was identified as a polling booth because there was some ""confusion over the many room numbers in the school.""

Principal Pandey is more than pleased and will now withdraw the petition he had lodged in the high court on Thursday. ""The collector was very considerate and he apologised for the blunder made by his people,"" he said.

8,Jogi the rallying point in Mahasamund,"MAHASAMUND: The Jogi factor is the driving force in this high-profile constituency. The former chief minister''s entry into the election fray has bonded some with their political kin and divided some.

Thanks to Jogi, new BJP entrant and political stalwart Vidya Charan Shukla has finally been accepted in his new saffron parivar. Local BJP leaders who earlier thought Shukla was an outsider have now come out in his support. Their motive: to see Jogi defeated in the electoral game.

In the Congress, however, the Jogi factor seems to have had an opposite effect. Mahasamund has been the family bastion of Shyama Charan Shukla, Jogi''s arch rival in the party and Vidya Charan''s elder brother. The tribal Jogi has not been kind to the upper caste Shyama Charan. So much so, that in the Assembly elections in December, Jogi reportedly put up a rebel candidate in Rajim to beat Shyama Charan''s political heir and official Congress candidate Amitesh Shukla. Now, it''s payback time.

According to sources, familial ties matter more to Shyama Charan than loyalty to the party. He could be reluctant to campaign against his brother even if he is on the wrong side of the fence.

And with absolutely no one to take charge of Jogi''s campaign, the Congress'' presence in the constituency is apparently scattered.

And there is another problem looming large over the Congress. Pawan Diwan, who had earlier won from Mahasamund and was all set to contest again had Jogi not made an entry, has now switched over to the BJP. Not exactly a political heavyweight, but he still commands some votes in certain segments of Mahasamund and is reportedly doing his best to turn them saffron. Meanwhile, the animosity in Congress ranks is likely to reap some benefits for Vidya Charan, who seems to be at an advantage simply by default. He''s won all LS polls since 1957, except for two.

9,Gujarat's riot zone holds the election key,"AHMEDABAD: The riot zone of Gujarat, comprising areas of Central and North Gujarat which erupted after the Godhra incident on February 27, 2002, and gave rich dividends to the ruling BJP in the assembly elections held in December that year, may hold the key to the Lok Sabha elections due in the state on April 20.

Congress, which got badly mauled in the assembly elections, is hoping to stage a comeback from a situation which looked impossible two years back. ""If we win 2 or 3 seats in the riot affected zones against all odds, it would mean we can reach a double digit tally in Gujarat,"" said a former Congress CM.

There is reason for optimism in the Congress camp that it can spring some surprises in the riot zone comprising 11 Lok Sabha seats of Chotaudepur, Vadodara, Kheda, Anand, Kapadvanj, Godhra, Dahod, Ahmedabad, Gandhinagar, Mehsana and Sabarkantha.

In the 1999 elections, Congress won 4 of these seats â€” Mehsana, Sabarkantha and Kheda and Kapadvanj â€” only to concede the Mehsana seat to BJP in a later by-election. But while Congress won 4 Lok Sabha seats and BJP 7, a closer examination shows that out of the total of 77 assembly segments in these 11 Lok Sabha seats, the Congress (38) and BJP (39) were evenly placed.

The dramatic transformation came in the assembly elections when out of these 77 assembly seats, BJP won 62 and Congress just 15. This was a gain of 23 seats/segments for BJP over the 1999 figure. It is significant here that if we take the whole of Gujarat into account, BJP gained 14 seats/segments between 1999 and 2002. This means, outside the riot-affected zone, BJP actually lost 9 seats/segments.

Even in the riot-affected zone, even though BJP may still hold the edge in most seats, there is a tough fight between the two main parties, except for Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar which seem to be clearly going BJP''s way.

The reason for this is clear. The communal polarisation, which was evident at the time of riots is on the wane. Seeking votes in the name of development is a tough task for the Modi government, especially in constituencies like Chotaudepur, Dahod, Godhra and Sabarkantha which have a large tribal component.

10,Cong insulting Sikhs by fielding 1984 riot accused: Badal,"CHANDIGARH: Shiromani Akali Dal President Parkash Singh Badal on Saturday described as ""brutally insensitive and a gross insult to Sikhs"" the Congress decision to field Jagdish Tytler, Ajay Makan and Sajjan Kumar, accused in the 1984 anti-Sikh riots, in the Lok Sabha elections.

Badal said it was strange that the Congress was ""honouring the butchers of innocent Sikhs"" at a time when a descendent of Bahadur Shah Zafar was apologising for the excesses committed by Mughal emperors against Sikh gurus and their followers, he said in a statement here.

""Perhaps Congress President Sonia Gandhi deems it below her dignity to offer regrets for the brutal acts of her predecessors in the family and the party"", the Akali leader claimed.

Badal Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh must quit the Congress on the issue or categorically state whether or not he agreed with his party president Sonia Gandhi in the matter.

The Akali leader said not only he and the SAD, but all right thinking persons in the country were shocked by the ""utter disregard of public opinion and human values shown by Congress"" in choosing these persons to represent the party in the polls.

Badal also took a dig at leftist leaders like Harkishan Singh Surjit who ""never tire of wearing the secular mantle"".

""Their secularism has been put to the severest test by Congress and this could be their last opportunity to stop aiding communalism of Congress. Their stand on the issue would also provide a clue to the genuineness of their secular credentials,"" he said.
