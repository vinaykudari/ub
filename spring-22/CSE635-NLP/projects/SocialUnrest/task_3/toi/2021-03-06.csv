1,Grooming principals to pass NAAC test,"KOLKATA: Principals of top five government colleges of the state are being groomed to face the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) peer team when it comes to the city. The state government wants to ensure that the principals present their cases in a convincing manner.

The higher education department has given the director of public instruction the responsibility to see that every college is smartly turned out. The DPI has to check and re-check every step in the run up to the NAAC visit.

A lot of importance is being attached to the training of principals since they are the face of their colleges. A module has been devised for coaching them at the Administrative Training Institute (ATI) at Shrabani, Salt Lake.

Presidency College, Lady Brabourne College, Bethune College, Moulana Azad College and Goenka College of Commerce and Business Administration are taking part in this exercise.

â€œEach of these colleges are legends in their own rights, but we must remember that they will be assessed by scholars from outside who might not be aware of their records. So, reticence will not help and each principal needs to be emphatic about the achievements of his or her college,â€� DPI Pijush Ganguly told TNN.

Lectures are being organised for principals on basic management skills. They are being individually trained so that they can smartly present the academic records of their colleges, their strengths, weaknesses and vision for the coming years. Cleanliness of the colleges is a cause for concern. â€œWe have explained to the principals to pay special attention to this, so that every nook and corner of the college is spic and span. This has to start on a day-today basis,â€� Ganguly added. The studentsâ€™ common rooms are also being spruced up.

Every college has already prepared its self-study report on the basis of which NAAC would come down for assessment.

But unlike other colleges which send their reports directly to NAAC, the government colleges have sent them to the DPI first. The latter is not only scrutinising every bit of information that the colleges are sending, but also holding repeated meetings with principals suggesting corrections. â€œThe stress is on smart presentation, graphics and charts, because it is from these that NAAC is going to get its first impression about the college,â€� Ganguly said.

After the DPI finalises the reports, they will be scrutinised by the higher education department before being finally sent to NAAC.

2,'CM playing Pota politics',"LUCKNOW: Union minister of state for home, Chinmayanand Swami on Friday accused chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav of playing politics in the release of Pota detainees - former minister and MLA Raghuraj Pratap Singh alias ''Raja Bhaiyya'' and his father Udai Pratap Singh.

In an informal chat with Times News Network here during his hopping visit from Delhi, he said that Mulayam did not seem to be serious at all about release of the two Singhs. He was interested only in politics by blaming the BJP or Centre for the delay.

In support of his contention, the minister said that if at all serious, then Mulayam in his capacity as CM could set up a state committee for review of Pota charges and also denotify Pota in UP. Power, he said, was given to state governments under amendments enacted by Lok Sabha in the Pota Act. A move to this effect was made at the behest of BJP just to check political misuse of Pota and give relief to those implicated falsely under it for any political rivalry.

""Putting blame on the Centre is thus an easy excuse on the part of Mulayam Singh Yadav, who has refused to act within the provisions of Pota Act. Sympathy shown by him towards the two Singhs is nothing but lip service,"" Swami said, adding that the role of the Centre was limited in it.

The review committee set up by the Centre was also a quasi-judicial process and the aggrieved party was free to approach it, he explained. The Centre would come in the picture, if the state denotified Pota.

As for denotification of Pota, he said, this was well within the power of the state government and already the power was used by Yadav in notifying section 3/75 of the Essential Commodities Act despite statewide protest against it by traders.

Citing examples of Maharashtra and Jharkhand, Swami said that a large number of Pota detainees were released on recommendations made to this effect by their state review committees respectively.

In the backdrop of these developments, he said Mulayam stood exposed for his ambiguous stance on the Pota issue, which he refused to invoke against an MLA, Mukhtar Ansari despite his alleged involvement in the purchase of light machine gun (LMG) stolen from some army base.

While taking a plea that his government was against the use of Pota, Yadav took offence against those police officials, who tried to initiate proceedings to this effect against Ansari and got these officials transferred, Swami said.

Raja Bhaiyya and his father are currently lodged in Pratapgarh jail and their detention under Pota is a cause for worry to both BJP and Samajwadi Party, who are trying to become their saviours without being able to get them any relief.

5,SP to contest 250 seats in LS polls,"LUCKNOW: The Samajwadi Party will contest about 250 seats in the coming Lok Sabha elections, party''s national general secretary Amar Singh told newspersons on Friday, after a meeting of the Central Parliamentary Board.

6,Sharad Joshi party in NDA now,"NEW DELHI: The BJP''s got help in Vidarbha: On Friday, it persuaded Swatantra Bharat Paksh (SBP) president Sharad Joshi to join the NDA at the BJP office.

Joshi''s SBP represents farmers'' organisations in 14 states, including Maharashtra''s Shetkari Sangathan, UP''s Bharatiya Kisan Union and the south''s Ryot Sanghams.

He said his party had joined the NDA since the BJP had agreed to back its demand for a separate Vidarbha state carved out of Maharashtra, and the Shiv Sena had said it will include in its manifesto a commitment to make up for the financial/developmental backlog of Vidarbha for the last three years.

This is expected to cause some confusion in Congress ranks. The weak link for the party is Vidarbha where its leaders such as Ranjeet Deshmukh have been demanding a separate state.

BJP sources said that while SBP will not be given any LS seats, it will be given nine or 10 assembly seats when the state elections are announced.

These sources added that SBP had 40,000-odd votes in 10-12 LS constituencies in Maharashtra and could influence the polls in 30-40 assembly seats.

7,Health melas set the tone for polls,"New Delhi: Before the campaigners could set foot in constituencies to raise the poll temperature, what came in handy for the MPs to do the first round of mobilisation, was health melas.

A brainchild of health minister Sushma Swaraj, the health melas took place around the country - in 512 Lok Sabha constituencies.

Partly funded by the health ministry and with logistical support from the network of hospitals, the three-day melas were organised during the month starting from January 15.

Accused of wooing the voters with the melas where operations and check-ups were free, Swaraj said the decision had been taken in November.

8,Tinseltown joins political chorus,"NEW DELHI: Star stock had plummeted in 1977 after many mega stars turned out for Congress but failed to prevent its maiden defeat in national elections.

Dev Anand and G P Sippy launched a filmy political outfit, National Party, in 1980 and it disappeared.

After that individual stars, known for their political affiliations, like Sunil Dutt, Shatrughan Sinha, Rajesh Khanna, Shabana Azmi, Raj Babbar and Vinod Khanna have made it to Parliament, but Bollywood had never gate-crashed into mainline parties as they have done this time.

Of course, the unkind might say that most of the celebs staging political entries are either has-beens or wannabes. Apart from Amitabh Bachchan, can you think of one Bollywood superstar in his prime making the leap?

On the other hand, South India, long derided for celluloid overlay to its politics, must be grinning from ear-to-ear. It can justifiably claim - after IT - to have set the trend for North to follow.

True, no star here has made it to the front row of the political matinee show. But who knows what new twist lies in the script.

10,DMs asked to form committees for elections,"LUCKNOW: Chief electoral officer, Vijay Sharma has issued directions to all the district magistrates in the state to form district level committees to monitor forthcoming Lok Sabha polls.

11,Caste factor: Hidden agenda of all political parties,"AMRITSAR: No political party admits it openly but the caste factor while allotting party tickets or mobilizing the voters, reigns high over the feel good factor and this is believed to be one of the eligibility criteria for those who are in fray of getting party ticket from a particular constituency for the ensuing Lok Sabha poll.

Celebrity candidates are the rare exceptions since they have their ready mass base with them . Constitutionally no political party could seek votes on the basis of religion or caste but in practical almost all political parties adheres to their hidden agenda of caste based politics and even conducts sample surveys before allotting party tickets said Kuldeep Singh, professor, political science, Guru Nanak Dev University (GNDU) while talking to TNN on Saturday.

Politicization of castes presumably remains in the hidden agenda of every political party since it is one of the major winning criteria. For their own vested interests the political parties creates groups on the basis of ethnic and religious considerations and accordingly area wise election plans are worked out. Unfortunately, the weaker or underdeveloped sections of society are not considered as citizens of India but a vote bank of a particular political party confessed a senior politician requesting anonymity.

In Punjab, rural based Jat Sikh peasantry is believed to be the mass base of Akali politics, dalit, urban Sikhs including a part of rural jat Sikhs and working class for congress while BJP gains it strength from urban based middle class, trading community and little support form rural side with few exceptions said Kuldeep Singh adding that Majhabi Sikhs could dwindle between BSP or other political party. Traditionally there have always been rivalry between Jat and Non Jat Sikhs but that was due to land holdings only and not due to castes. The allotting of tickets to a Hindu , Sikh or backward class candidate were the examples that itself denies the claims of political parties of being secular.

Political parties inclination to a particular section of society reflects in its policies when they form government. They would try to appease their vote bank and would symbolically draft policies for the section of society that was not their vote bank.

Another poll manager for Amrisar Lok Sabha constituency seat pleading not to give his name said they have prepared area wise caste based lists of voters and their election campaign leaders would be appointed accordingly. â€œIt is a necessary evil,â€� said he.

12,"Pak oppn legislator shot, sparking clashes","KARACHI: Unidentified gunmen shot dead a Pakistani opposition legislator and his guard on Saturday, sparking violent scuffles between protesters and police in the restive port city of Karachi, police said.

Abdullah Murad, a Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) member of the provincial assembly in southern Sindh province, was attacked as he left his home in the eastern Malir district by car.

""Murad and his guard died while being taken to hospital,"" Karachi city police chief Tariq Jamil told AFP.

He said the motive was not immediately known.

Party activists protesting the killing tried to block a main road in the city and threw stones at police and buses, officers and witnesses said. ""In return we fired a few teargas shells to disperse them,"" said police officer Asif Rauf.

All shops and markets were closed in Malir as Murad''s body arrived back at his house, where some 2,000 supporters had gathered.

Additional police forces were brought in to maintain order, Rauf said.

Karachi, the commercial and industrial center of the country, has a history of political, ethnic and religiously-motivated violence.

The PPP, headed by exiled former prime minister Benazir Bhutto, is the largest single party in the Sindh assembly but the province is governed by a coalition led by ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Q.

13,"LS polls: It's the same corruption talk, stupid!","SHIMLA: With both the Congress and the BJP leaders claiming that corruption would be a major issue in the forthcoming Lok Sabha elections in Himachal, it appears that there will be a runon of the last assembly elections in the state when the Congress party came out with serious allegations of corruption against the then chief minister Prem Kumar Dhumal.

That Dhumal had filed a defamation case against Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh and other Congress leaders, including AICC spokesman Anand Sharma, which is still pending in the courts here, is another issue, but the fact remains that the elections here have degenerated into mud-slinging and slandering, rather than discussions on party policies and programmes.

The state unit of the BJP has given an indication of what lies in store during the canvassing that will follow in the days to come for the forthcoming Lok Sabha elections, with party leaders having submitted a chargesheet against the Virbhadra government to governor V S Kokje on Friday.

Besides listing various allegations against the government and some ministers in the government, the BJP also alleged a complete breakdown in the law and order situation of the state and cited the murder of the cousin sister of Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh at the Punjab government''s circuit house located here a few months back.

The BJP leaders have also not refrained from attacking the chief minister for reportedly defending Intuc chief Amarjit Singh Bawa, against whom about 70 criminal cases have reportedly been registered in Haryana under various sections of the IPC.

However, chief minister Virbhadra Singh has termed the allegations as a ""bundle of created lies,"" adding that it did not behove those who were the fountainhead of corruption when they were in power to speak on corruption.

Claiming that the chargesheet was ""a huriedly put together slip-shod document of baseless allegations, conjectures and surmises not worth the paper on which it was printed,"" he said that he himself had ordered a review of the licences granted by the industries department for setting up of the arc furnaces, as they were not evenly distributed.

On the lottery issue that was being raked up by the BJP, he said that the party leaders forgot that the ban on lottery was lifted by the previous BJP government itself, and the present government headed by him, had only taken further action in the matter.

But apparently the matter does not end here, and the Congress is getting all geared up to face the allegations that are likely to be hurled at it by the BJP leaders.

As a counter to the BJP blitz, reliable sources said the assets of former chief minister Prem Kumar Dhumal and other leaders are being looked into by the vigilance department.

The list of assets of Dhumal that Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh had released during the last assembly elections, which the BJP leaders had a hard time trying to clear, is now being probed by the state investigating agencies, and it is said that some of the holdings could be ascertained during the electioneering for the forthcoming Lok Sabha polls.

In fact, the very fact that the BJP leaders have come up to defend some of the people against whom allegations of corruption have been levelled, and in the case of the Himachal Pradesh University vice-chancellor these charges have even been ascertained, shows that the BJP has a lot to answer for.

This has given a handle to Cong leaders, including chief minister Virbhadra Singh, to whip up the issue of corruption, keen state-watchers said.
