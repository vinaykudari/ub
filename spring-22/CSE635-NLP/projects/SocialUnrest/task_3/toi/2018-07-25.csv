9,Subba Reddy to contest Advocate Association polls,"bangalore: basavanagudi mla k.n. subba reddy said he will contest the advocates' association elections on july 29 at the instance of some young lawyers in the association. at a press conference here, subba reddy expressed concern over the `effort' by several vips, including high court judges, to indirectly influence the proceedings. asserting that he had already contacted the chief justice on the matter, he requested the returning officer to conduct the polls peacefully. since the general secretary himself is a candidate for the president's post, the president should conduct the same in a fair manner without room for malpractices. recalling his presidential stint for nine years, he claimed the association, which started in 1900, has come to occupy a reputed position in the country. he regretted that the centenary celebrations hadn't been conducted and promised that if elected, his primary duty would be to celebrate the same. subba reddy asked the government to amend the advocates welfare act so that assistance up to rs 2 lakh can be given by the bar council in the case of death or retirement of advocates. a change in the trail court timings from 10:45 am to 11 am will help the advocates in reaching the court in time; the present timing clashes with the office peak hours.

11,Uproar in House over minister's remark on Speaker,"bangalore:the legislative assembly on wednesday witnessed pandemonium scenes following a remark by forests minister k.h. ranganath that speaker m.v. venkatappa was talking more than anyone else in the house. the entire opposition was on its feet over the remarks terming it as an insult to the chair. as the zero hour was coming to a close and opposition leader jagadish shettar rose to speak about incidents in chamarajnagara, law and parliamentary affairs minister d.b. chandre gowda said: ``you have to give us time to place the demands in the house. the opposition cannot monopolise the house.'' venkatappa said: ``both the opposition and the ruling parties members should make adjustments for the smooth conduct of the house.'' an irked ranganath sought to know what adjustments the speaker was talking about and demaned to know if it was a panchayat he was conducting. ``do you know this is the legislative assembly. we have a constitution. we have to work according to the constitution.'' the speaker said: ``i have not said we have to work like a panchayat.'' ranganath said: ``we have our own constitution. it cannot work with any adjustment.'' as the legislative assembly secretary was briefing the speaker, ranganath directed the latter to come away. ``the speaker has to listen to what i am saying.'' the entire opposition was on its feet and said the minister was questioning the authority of the chair. ``he is showing disrespect to the chair. it is an insult,'' they shouted. ranganath stood his ground and said: ``i have not committed any mistake.'' s. suresh kumar (bjp) said it was ironical that ranganath having been himself a speaker once has made such a statement. ``we cannot tolerate this behaviour from him,'' he added. deputy opposition leader d.v. sadananda gowda said the behaviour of ranganath was equivalent to threatening the chair. ``if this is the plight of the speaker, then who will protect us?'' he asked. at this point, some members from the treasury benches including fisheries minister b. ramanath rai protested. the opposition demanded that the speaker expunge the ranganath's remarks. venkatappa agreed and ordered that the remarks be removed. but ranganath objected seeking to know which are the remarks the speaker was removing. the speaker replied: ``i will tell you tomorrow.'' ranganath refused to budge and said nothing unparliamentary was uttered by him. ``i will not allow you to remove the remarks. you can take any action against me. the opposition can move a resolution against me, or you (speaker) can take suo motu action against me. all i have said is let the house run as per law.'' the speaker did not expunge the remarks and only said: ``what you (ranganath) have said is not in good taste.''

12,Probe panels suffer govt apathy,"patna: in bihar, the government talks of fast-track courts and at the same time makes the probe by different commissions move at a snail's pace. the cabinet on tuesday extended the terms of justice loknath prasad commission and justice nagendra rai commission which are inquiring into the police firing on students at imamganj and the alleged assault by policemen on a judge at bhagalpur respectively. it fixed the salary of justice vidyanand, who heads another commission to inquire into the pratappur episode, almost four months after the government constituted the panel. the government is yet to provide the infrastructure needed by the justice vidyanand commission to begin the probe. ""the requisite infrastructure should be provided without any delay so that an inquiry commission can begin its work immediately,"" stated justice amir das, who heads the commission set up to probe into the alleged nexus between politicians and the outlawed private army ranvir sena. although the notification regarding the formation of the commission was issued on december 22, 1997, immediately after the laxmanpur bathe massacre, its term has already been extended five times. ""the commission could start functioning only after april 1998 when the requisite infrastructure -- office, car and staff -- was provided to it,"" said justice das. justice das stated that the commission completed its probe into the ranvir sena affairs in december last year. ""it was a difficult task cross-examining about 130 witnesses, especially when nobody wanted to appear before the commission for fear of life,"" he maintained. in the meantime, justice das said, ""the state government gave the commission another assignment of probing into the miapur massacre and two more carnages"". non-cooperation and indifference on the part of government agencies are the common complaints made by the commissions. justice das was quick to recall how he had to write to the dgp when the sp of gaya failed to ensure the appearance of 11 witnesses. ""i asked the dms of five districts in which the ranvir sena has its influence to give me reports on the status of land problem. but i did not receive even a single report,"" he stated. ""we have had to issue notices more than once to get our work done,"" admitted b k srivastava, secretary of the justice loknath prasad commission. set up in 1998 to probe into the alleged conspiracy and security lapses in the murder of two sitting mlas, ajit sarkar and brij bihari prasad, the commission started functioning only after march 1999 when it was provided with the requisite infrastructure. ""our job in both these cases is almost complete. we will be submitting our report on the brij bihari prasad murder case within the next 15 days. this will be followed by our report on the ajit sarkar murder case,"" srivastava stated. he said the commission's term has been extended on account of it being asked to probe into the police firing on students at imamganj on august 17 and on cpi(ml) workers at ara on august 30. a commission has been functioning since 1997 to inquire into the conduct of policemen in manhandling of a judge and lawyers at bhagalpur. justice b p singh, who headed the commission, was transferred as the chief justice of the mumbai high court. the commission is currently headed by justice nagendra rai, a sitting judge of the patna high court. ""a sitting judge is overloaded with court cases. so, it is unreasonable to expect from him that he would give adequate time for commission work,"" remarked a lawyer. yet another commission headed by justice ali ahmad was set up in 1996 to probe into the excess withdrawals in government departments. nobody appears to have any idea as to what the commission is doing.
