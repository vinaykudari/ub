7,Engineers deplore govt's contract move,"PATNA: The Bihar Engineering Services Association (BESA) leaders have voiced protest against the state government''s proposed move to appoint retired engineers on senior posts on contract. The proposed move is tantamount to violation of Article 16 of the Constitution as every official has a fundamental right to be considered for promotion in service, said BESA leaders while talking to newsmen.

The government move would deprive every engineer in government service of promotional chances, they said and demanded considering, what they called cumulative service tenure, while considering an engineer for promotion.

They also demanded implementation of ""post-wise roster system"" as per the SC order given in R K Sabbharwal vs Government of Punjab case while considering the case of engineers for roster clearance for promotion.

The leaders charged road construction department secretary, S K Sharma, with being the main hurdle in way to promotion of the engineers. They said that Sharma is against promotion of engineers. That is why not a single promotion of engineers has materialised during his tenure.

10,Ad Asia mantra: Break rules to break even,"JAIPUR: Elephants, royalty, beauty queens and the future of Brand India. The creme de la creme of the advertising, marketing and communication world back-slapped their way into Ad Asia 2003 as the mega networking conference got off to a colourful start here on Monday.

Hotel rooms canâ€™t be had for love or money as 1,400 delegates from over 20 countries are furiously networking, brainstorming over the four-day jamboree.

The biennial Pan-Asian conference is coming to India after a gap of 21 years. The timing is pertinent. The advertising industry sees itself on the cusp of great times ahead, mirroring the general feel-good factor about Brand India.

However, it also sees this as an occasion to tackle certain worrying issues â€” after two terrible years, growth rates have perked up, but still remain in single digits.

In an age where consumers are being bombarded by too many choices, many feel the ad industry will have to work extra hard to build strong brands that can break through the clutter.

â€˜â€˜The industry desperately needs creative breakthroughs. Also, companies are putting pressure on agencies to deliver more bang for the buck, says a marketing manager of major FMCG brands.

It was fitting then that arguably the biggest brand in India â€” Amitabh Bachchan â€” deconstructed the theme of the conference: Break The Rules. In an eloquent opening speech, the film star had the audience eating out of his hand when he argued that rules are never broken, even going against the norm mirrors what the market wants.

For instance, Bachchan said the â€˜â€˜angry man image in the 1970s was a requirement at a time the Emergency had been declared. And his portrayal of the gameshow host in KBC was again a requirement of a post-liberalisation age where younger consumers needed a reassuring face telling them that money isnâ€™t a bad thingâ€™â€™.

15,Foodstall owner quizzed on riot-murder,"AHMEDABAD: A foodstall owner selling non-vegetarian snacks near the Kalupur Tower on Sunday night was detained by the Kalupur police on Wednesday.

Sources told TNN that the detention is in connection with the murder of Porus Mehta who was burnt alive when communal violence erupted in the Kalupur area following rumours about a murder in Juhapura.

Investigations conducted by city police officials have revealed that this snack-stall owner, identified as Kadarbhai Pirmohammad of Lucky Chinese Food cart, may be in the know of the murder and suspect that kerosene from the foodstall may have been used to burn Mehta.

Police, after conducting preliminary inspection of the spot on Sunday night had said that Mehta, who stayed near the Swaminarayan temple in Kalupur, was accosted by a group of miscreants who stabbed him and set his motorcycle on fire. Another person passing the area had also sustained stab injuries and 25 per cent burns in the episode.

However, subsequent investigations revealed that Mehta may have parked his vehicle and might have been eating some snacks when the incident occurred around 11 pm.

â€œAluminium foil used to wrap snacks was found right next to the deceasedâ€™ bike,â€� sources said. This led the investigators to conclude that the foodstall owner may be an eye-witness or even an accused in this gruesome incident.

â€œWe used our information network to track down the foodstall owner and also recover the handcart used by him,â€� said a police officer. On Wednesday afternoon the handcart was inspected minutely by a two-member team of experts from the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL), Gandhinagar.

Joint commissioner of police P C Thakur said: â€œTyres of this handcart have been sent to the FSL to verify if there are any traces of blood on them.â€�

The police authorities also decided, after a meeting in the evening, to lift curfew from the sensitive Kalupur and Dariapur areas, from 5 am on Thursday.

Night curfew, however, would continue to be enforced. On Wednesday, authorities had relaxed curfew in these areas of the Walled City for four hours between 8 am and 12 noon.

People had come out in large numbers to stock up on essentials. Meanwhile, six persons injured during the violence in Kalupur are undergoing treatment at two government hospitals and a private clinic for burns, stab and stone injuries. Hospital sources said condition of all victims is stable.
