1,Modi flays Cong bid to thwart unanimous selection,"vadodara: chief minister narendra modi came down heavily on the congress for its attempts to force polls in villages trying to have unanimously elected candidates to village panchayats. the city unit of the bjp, meanwhile, capitalised on modi's visit by conducting a handsome rally in a show of strength. modi, who was in the city for the first time after taking over as cm, addressed a convention of district bjp unit workers at tarsali. he used the opportunity to come down heavily on the congress and hard sell the samras concept of giving monetary incentive to village panchayats which selected unanimous representatives. modi said: ""the congress seems to be adopting a divide-and-rule policy in the villages for political gains. it is trying to force elections in villages which have decided to adopt the policy."" he blamed congress of adopting double standards over the issue. ""in 1992, the congress had come up with the idea of giving incentives to gram panchayats which had unanimously elected representatives. now they seem to have forgotten it, and are bent on ensuring polls at any cost,"" modi said. he pointed out that election rivalries in villages were deep-rooted, and even lead unpleasant consequences. ""this cannot be allowed to continue. instead, villagers can strive for development by having unanimity,"" he said. modi observed that it would be wrong to say that samras was a bjp programme, and added: ""the slogan was given by vinoba bhave, and sarvoday leaders worked for it."" the chief minister said he was not averse to the idea of congress representatives being selected unanimously to village panchayats. ""let anybody get elected unanimously, but at least do it,"" he said. meanwhile, city unit workers of bjp took out a rally through the city with modi greeting the citizens. the cm moved with the rally from the airport to tarsali village. representatives of various areas greeted him on route to the venue for the party convention. the cm also kicked off the state-wide intensive pulse polio vaccination drive by administering the vaccine to a child in a school in the gita mandir area of the city.

7,Will govt come to GEB's rescue?,"vadodara: will the gujarat government bail out the gujarat electricity board (geb) from its financial mess. just witness the anxiety that the geb finds it difficult to raise money from the market, whatever the reason. the power tariff revision in october last has not helped at all in improving the financial position as farmers opposed the introduction of meter-based tariff and the government refused the full amount of subsidy for the power consumed by farmers. ever since the slab rate for farm consumers was introduced in 1987 ,the revenue loss to the board has been tremendous. the squaring up of rs 4,000 cr agriculture subsidy amount against the outstanding government loans of rs 4,200 cr has worsened the geb's financial position. besides, the government has been reducing the plan allocation to the geb, whose accumulated loss had been to the tune of rs 2,576 cr in 1998-99, rs 2,500 cr in 1999-2000, and rs 2,300 cr in 2000-2001. of the average monthly revenue of rs 800 cr, fuel cost for own generation as well as power purchased from independent power producers/ central sector works out to rs 1,000 cr leaving a gap of rs 200 cr. so the geb is under constant cash flow problems. the bond market does not allow geb to raise more funds due to several reasons. the foremost is the prevailing recession. its on going rs 300 cr bond issue, is not fully subscribed despite its extension for two months. this is the first time the geb had to extend the last date of this bond issue twice because it was not getting fully subscribed. so far it has mopped up rs 270 cr and remaining amount of rs 30 cr will be raised soon, it was hoped. financial institutions and banks are not coming forward either, in subscribing to it. the bond issue has been putting heavy financial burden on geb as it carries interest of 14 per cent to 12 per cent per annum. the asian development bank is also reluctant to release second tranche of $ 50 million to the geb due to delay in the passage of the power reforms bill. the geb engineers association suggested that if the government decided to scrap sales tax and service charge on the fuels used by geb for generation of power, it will help the geb in saving a huge amount of rs 660 cr per annum. sales tax is 20 per cent and service charge is 2 per cent. the association and all the six employees unions of geb have been demanding review of the power purchase agreement ( ppa) because they have been putting heavy financial burden on geb whether it purchases their power or not. within 48 hours of assumption of office, chief minister narendra modi long meeting with geb chairman nalin bhatt. officials like member administration j n singh, member finance m srivastav, member technical p h rana were present, besides energy minister kaushik patel, energy and power secretary manjula subramaniam. however, the government has not taken any step nor has it given any inkling to the geb as to how it would help the latter to improve its financial position. now modi has completed two months in office and yet the delay on the government's part has led observers to feel that the government is intent on weakening the financial position so as to ensure that there is no hurdle to the passage of the power reforms bill in the assembly. the joint action committee of all recognised employees unions and engineers are opposed to it and are gearing up for a protest. they are banking on their national apex body's support which has promised to support a nationwide strike on this issue.

8,Sonia will not attend Pawar’s birthday party,"new delhi: congress president sonia gandhi will not be accepting the invitation for ncp leader sharad pawar's 61st birthday party to be held in mumbai on december 12. the invitation, extended to sonia by a broad-based organising committee headed by former prime minister chandra shekhar and handed over by pawar's confidante praful patel, has been politely declined. ''the congress president has received an invitation for the party... she gets several such invitations. but her schedule is such that she will not be able to attend pawar's birthday party,'' congress spokesperson s jaipal reddy told reporters here on monday. pawar's presence at cpm leader somnath chatterjee's famous ''unity dinner'' last week had generated considerable speculation in political circles about a larger opposition unity. this was particularly so as the dinner was soon followed by an invitation to sonia for pawar's birthday party. however, all talk of larger opposition unity was quickly brushed aside by pawar, who publicly stated that he had not invited sonia for his birthday party and that the invitation was sent by the organising committee. he also maintained that though he had attended somnath chatterjee's dinner, he had not spoken to sonia. he further stated that his objection to her foreign origins were still valid. he also ruled out the possibility of his attending the congress chief's iftar party, slated for december 11, in case an invitation is sent to him. it is also unlikely that pawar will figure in the congress party's guest list for its iftar party. senior congress leaders had earlier indicated that invitations would be sent out to leaders of all non-nda parties, which includes pawar and samajwadi party leaders mulayam singh yadav and amar singh. the sp leaders may be invited for the congress iftar, but congress leaders said this would now depend upon whether sonia is invited to the samajwadi party's iftar on december 5.

9,No set rules on treatment of pregnant women with AIDS,"pune: despite all the money spent on aids awareness and control programmes, there is no standard guideline for treatment of pregnant women infected with hiv. to compound matters, pune, along with mumbai and sangli, has the highest number of hiv-infected pregnancies in the country. doctors are now awaiting results of a feasibility study being conducted at the national aids control organisation (naco) on how to reduce the chances of viral transmission from the infected mother to the baby. findings of the study, conducted at 11 centres across the country, are expected to be out soon. the study is examining the effects of a prescribed anti-retro viral drug on infected women. while most city hospitals prescribe zidoviudin or nevirapine, some others administer lamivudin to hiv-infected pregnant women. naco, which earlier recommended zidoviudin for hiv-infected pregnant woman, later switched to nevirapine, which was cheaper. aids specialist dr sanjay pujari said there was utter confusion among doctors, particularly in government- run hospitals about the correct treatment since there were no standard guidelines. ''some countries have made it mandatory for doctors to administer a common anti-retroval drug to patients,'' he said. according to dr pujari, the prevalence of hiv infection among pregnant women in the city had crossed two per cent, due mainly to lack of screening and diagnostic facilities for pregnant women, compounded by poor access to retro-viral drugs and breast milk substitutes. it made matters worse when there was no standard procedure laid down for handling mother-to-child transmission. dr sanjay mehendale, deputy director, nari, said studies had been recently carried out in thailand and abidjan (africa) by administering doses of zidoviudin, and it showed 50 and 37 per cent reduction in the rate of transmission, respectively, from the infected mother to the child. another study with nevirapine was conducted at uganda where the risk of transmitting the disease from the mother to baby was reduced by 47 per cent.",pune

13,Opposition to terror law based on past experience,"allahabad: the opposition to poto both by the samajwadi party and the congress and other opposition parties in parliament and outside is based on bitter experiences of the past and is not based on mere apprehensions about its misuse, comments sp leader k n khare.khare in a statement says that tada and misa were both misused by the congress to suppress the opposition to settle scores with the congress opponents. when normal laws of the land if implemented honestly were sufficient to deal with elements inciting violence or indulging in terrorist activities, where was the need for poto, he asks.khare says that when the bjp itself not in power had opposed tada and misa as draconian laws, what efficay did it find in enacting draconian laws in other forms. sp supremo ms yadav on the basis of past experiences about use and misuse of earlier such laws was crying hoarse against poto and not that he had love for terrorist, khare asserts.similar views have been expressed by other sp leaders and activ ists adding that the opposition to poto was born out of necessity for not bringing in such laws as gave the government a handle to harass minorities and other sections of the people.

15,American India Foundation forms board to focus on development work,"mumbai: the american india foundation, set up by a prominent group of indo-americans in april this year, has formed an indian advisory board to help the foundation focus its activities on specific areas of development like healthcare, disaster relief, education and income generation. co-chaired by financial sector heavyweights deepak parekh, chairman of hdfc and k.v. kamath, managing director and ceo of icici, the indian advisory board will help aif not only to identify specific projects but also devise an ongoing strategy for the foundation and earmark potential partners among non-governmental organisations, said rajat gupta, co-chairman of aif and managing director mckinsey and co. apart from messrs parekh and kamath, the other members of the advisory board are shabana azmi, harish mehta (md of onward novell, a software firm), television anchor prannoy roy, congress mp jairam ramesh, sourabh srivastava, ceo of infinity ventures, as well as dhirenbhai mehta, ashok alexander, amrita patel and shuban ganju, executive director of aif india. amitabh bachchan has also been invited to join the advisory board but is still to convey his decision to the aif. mr gupta said that aif was working to expand its total number of trustees in the united states. ``currently, we have about 40 trustees. we hope to increase that to 120 in the next 12 months. this will give us more fund-raising power as each trustee will bring his own funding base,'' he added. the aif trustees have to agree to contribute $100,000 to the foundation every year. these funds can be raised either through personal contributions or fund-raising activities. the aif has already raised $10 million in the u.s. the process of fund-raising and funding projects would be a long-term and continuous process. mr gupta admitted that with the bursting of the tech bubble on wall street, both the ability and desire of indo-americans to contribute to charitable causes had been affected. more recently, the 9-11 tragedy meant that lots of funds had been diverted to associated causes. ``but we are better organised than we were earlier this year to handle that,'' he said. so far, aif has disbursed only one million dollars (rs 5 crore approximately) to five ngos for reconstruction projects in gujarat. when asked about the slow pace of disbursement of funds--aif had earlier aimed to disburse rs 50 crore by the year-end--mr gupta said that the aif had long-term developmental aims and was not under any deadline to disburse funds. ``we are doing the appropriate funding and fund-raising. we are not trying to meet sales targets,'' was mr gupta's terse retort. the next meeting of the indian advisory board is slated for january 2002, when specific areas of focus will be decided by the foundation's trustees according to the recommendations of the advisory board.

16,Govt. yet to modify policy on waiver of tax for multiplexes,"mumbai: despite several representations made by the theatre owners association (toa) and the cinematograph exhibitors association (cea), the state government is yet to modify its policy regarding the waiver of entertainment tax for multiplexes. both the associations had protested against the state government's ``discriminatory policy'' of offering tax holidays to owners of multiplex cinema houses while old cinema houses continued to pay entertainment taxes. the toa and cea had downed shutters of all cinema halls on august 9 to protest against the pro-multiplex policy of the government. president of the cinematograph exhibitors association nestor d'souza said that talks were on with the state government to change the provisions of the bombay entertainment duty (amendment) ordinance 2001. as per the ordinance, the multiplex theatre complexes have been granted hundred per cent waiver of entertainment tax for the first three years and seventy five per cent tax waiver for the subsequent two years. an exhibitor said that if the talks fail then theatre owners will have no option but to file a writ petition. ``on the one hand the government complains about depleting finances and on the other it completely waives tax for multiplexes,'' he observed. an official of the cea stated that the the government order had done away with the level playing field between the single screen cinemas and the multiplexes. even as the tax waivers are a loss to the government exchequer, that is no boon to cinema lovers either, officials of the cinematograph exhibitors association claim. further the association members wonder whether the proprietors of multiplexes would abide by the stipulation to screen marathi films for 30 days in a year.

25,Govt to go ahead with terror law,"new delhi: the government categorically stated on tuesday that it would not withdraw the prevention of terrorism ordinance (poto) after the all-party meeting convened by it failed to arrive at a consenus on the issue. related stories prime minister atal bihari vajpayee, who had left scope for amendments in the ordinance to accommodate specific demands of those opposing its provisions, told the meeting that the government would seriously consider all suggestions made for changes in the ordinance, but it would not back off. briefing reporters after the two-hour long meeting, parliamentary affairs minister pramod mahajan quoted vajpayee as saying that in the present situation, the government felt that existing laws were not enough to tackle the threat of terrorism that india faced. dismissing apprehensions on the misuse of the law, vajpayee said: ""i feel in talking about the misuse, we have underestimated our ability to check it."" he assured that the government would not allow any misuse of the law. the meeting was divided along expected lines with all parties sticking to their stated views. while parties like samajwadi party and the rashtriya janata dal said existing laws were adequate to deal with terrorism, the left parties opposed the ordinance saying there were too many amendments needed to make it viable. the congress too spoke on expected lines, seeking the withdrawal of poto and the enactment of a new law brought in with due procedure and put before a standing committee before being passed in parliament. party chief sonia gandhi, leader of opposition in the rajya sabha dr manmohan singh and deputy leader in lok sabha shivraj patil represented the congress at the meeting. of the opposition parties, the aiadmk, which has already been vocal in support of poto, said so at the meeting. but the real shot in the government's arm came from sharad pawar of the nationalist congress party, who made over half-a-dozen suggestions for changes, but said his party would support the bill if these were heeded, mahajan said. nine of the 23 parties that attended the meeting, including the congress, opposed the ordinance while 14 supported it, some seeking amendments, mahajan said. the telugu desam party, an nda ally made demands for specific changes in certain clauses like reducing term of the ordinance from five years to three years and the one which deals with journalists. home minister l.k. advani denied the accusation that the ordinance had been promulgated in a hurry, saying that it had been discussed for over two years. he said security forces fighting terrorism often complained that after tada lapsed, there was no adequate law. mahajan said with the winter session due to end on december 21, the government had two weeks in which to enact the law. it would be brought for voting in the lok sabha next week and in the rajya sabha in the last week of the session. the controversial ordinance, promulgated in october, will lapse at the end of this month if it is not ratified by parliament. that the meeting would not amount to much seemed a foregone conclusion even before it began. earlier in the day, opposition parties dismissed the meeting as a ""charade"". even the government did not expect it to yield much, evident from the prime minister's decision on tuesday morning to bring the bill in parliament whether or not a consensus was reached in the evening. vajpayee told mps at a bjp parliamentary party meeting to be present in house not only on the days that the matter would be discussed but also on december 18, 19, 20 and 21, the last few days of the winter session. the bjp has announced a whip to be issued to its mps to be present in the lok sabha on december 12 and 13 and in the rajya sabha on december 18. stating that the government would bring the bill on december 10 or 11, bjp spokesman v.k. malhotra said there was ""no question of dropping the bill"" as demanded by the opposition parties. ""the government is willing to make adjustments but it is clear that it will bring the bill,"" he said. while malhotra said this was to ensure that important bills could be passed, political circles are looking at the move as a way of ensuring that if matters come to holding a joint session of both the lok sabha and the rajya sabha to vote on poto, the government has the adequate numbers present. the bjp leader said nda partners had also been requested to ensure full attendance in house. while the government enjoys a majority in the lok sabha, it is in minority in the upper house. in the event of a joint session being called, it will have the greater numbers, with aiadmk and ncp support only adding to the majority of the treasury benches.

29,State govt to rationalise high electricity duty,"gandhinagar: faced with agitations from the powerful bharatiya kisan sangh and other consumer bodies on the high electricity charges, the state government has in-principle decided to rationalise the existing structure of electricity duty. the move is expected to provide relief to consumers who have already been paying a high power tariff. it was learnt from reliable energy department sources that a team of senior officials from the finance and energy departments were directed by the state government to undertake the exercise of rationalising the electricity duty structure, which presently ranges between 5 per cent and 60 per cent -- perhaps the highest imposed by any state in the country. the team has been asked to have interactive sessions with various electricity companies and the state-owned gujarat electricity board, and submit its final report on the proposal of rationalisation at the earliest. the initiative for the proposed rationalisation of electricity duty, through which the state government earns a whooping rs 1,600 crore annually, has been taken by chief minister narendra modi who is perturbed over the tardy functioning of gujarat electricity board in the recent past. state energy minister kaushik patel, when contacted, told tnn that ""the proposal for rationalisation is under active consideration"". he said, it is presently difficult for him to predict as to when the state government would take a final decision. the state government will have to make a proper assessment once the report is submitted, as the decision may affect a major source of income for the state exchequer. he said, at present the minimum duty of 5 per cent is collected from farmers, while 50-60 per cent duty is being levied on commercial establishments. in addition to the electricity duty, the state government also earns a big chunk of income from sales-tax collected from electricity companies and gujarat electricity board. there is no possibility at this stage to review the sales-tax collected on the sale of electricity, he said. ""we are trying our best to reduce the burden on consumers and this proposal is an important move in that direction. the state government has already made a strong representation before the gujarat electricity regulatory commission to see to it that the commission issue guidelines in the larger interests of consumers,"" he said.

32,Socialists in NDA unite on foodgrains issue,"new delhi: efforts of three socialist parties in the nda — the janata dal-united, the samata party and the lok jan shakti — to re-unite got a fresh impetus on tuesday. fifteen of their 22 lok sabha mps took the unprecedented step of giving notice for an adjournment motion against the government. the subject was drawing attention to the centre's ''discrimination against bihar with respect to the fact that there are no fci procurement centres for foodgrains in the state and this has led to widespread distress among farmers''. the discrimination was all the more glaring, the mps said, because a bulk of the foodgrains produced in punjab, haryana and andhra pradesh were being lifted. realising the import of the issue, an embarrassed government swiftly acceded to a discussion under rule 193 on the subject next monday. but outside the house, a senior bjp minister first sought to make light of the issue by saying, ''you know what the members of these three parties are — those who are not ministers are all in the opposition''. but when pressed further, he said,'' i totally support the move and think there should be an official policy through which a fixed percentage of grains produced by the states should be lifted.
