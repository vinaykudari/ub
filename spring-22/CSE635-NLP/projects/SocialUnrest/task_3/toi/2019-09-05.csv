0,"Rebellion surfaces in BJP, NC in J&K polls","JAMMU: Electioneering is gaining momentum in Jammu and Kashmir. So has the time come for some to switch loyalties to ensure a smooth political career. In this context, there has been rebellion in the BJP and the National Conference.

While R S Chib left the National Conference and joined the BJP after being denied the Suchetgarh seat, BJP legislator Prem Lal joined the ruling party on Tuesday for not being fielded from Hiranagar (reserved) constituency.

However, the Congress claims to have nipped the possibilities of defection in the bud with a novel strategy. For instance, in Rajouri and Poonch districts, the party released the authority letters to all its seven candidates only on the last day of nominations on August 29.

Therefore, many disgruntled Congress workers couldnâ€™t switch sides as the official candidates were made known only at the 11th hour. â€˜â€˜The credit for this strategy goes to Mukul Wasnik and Satyajit Singh Gaekwad, who toured the state extensively to assess the situation and the rival claims,â€™â€™ a senior leader said on condition of anonymity.

â€˜â€˜Wasnik and Gaekwad found that there was more than one strong candidate in several constituencies. They realised that many could ditch the party and join the fray as rebels on being denied the ticket. To pre-empt this, they gave the authority letters to the party candidates on the last day of nominations. And the trick worked,â€™â€™ a legislator said. For the second phase of polls too, the party plans the same strategy.

1,Eight arrested in paddy scam,"FEROZEPUR: Stepping up its investigation in multi-crore paddy scam by some millers of Guruhar Sahai in Ferozepur in connivance with officials of various government procurement agencies, the police claims to have arrested eight officials.

Ludhiana superintendent of police Naunihal Singh, who was entrusted the investigation by the ADGP, claimed that eight government officials, including three class officers of various procurement agencies, were arrested on Wednesday.

According to sources, the SP had called Makhan Singh, District Food and Supply Controller (DFSC), posted at Moga; Amin Chand, a retired DFSC and Lakhwinder Singh, who had served as District Manager, Markfed, Ferozepur in connection with the inquiry. He had also called five others officials of Punsup, Ferozepur, namely Baldev Singh, Baldev Raj, Balraj Sharma, Amarjit Singh and Raj Kumar, to join the inquiry at the Circuit House, Ludhiana.

Later, they all were arrested by the police and brought to Ferozepur, where they all were produced in the court of Gurnam Singh. The court ordered one-day police remand for Lakhwinder Singh and Balraj Sharma while others were sent on judicial remand.

It may be recalled that some millers of Mandi Guruhar Sahai allegedly in connivance with the government officials misappropriated government paddy worth crores of rupees a couple of years ago. The scam was unearthed by local leader Sham Lal Bitta and subsequently a case under Section 406/420/120-B of the Indian Penal Code and Section 7 of the Essential Commodities Act was registered. When the local police failed to arrest the defaulter millers and government officials, a petition was filed in the Punjab and Haryana High Court by Sham Lal.

Subsequently, on the directions of the High Court, an inquiry was entrusted to the ADGP (Crime), who appointed Naunihal Singh to investigate the scam. One miller of Mandi Guruhar Sahai, Faqir Chand Midha, was also arrested by the Ludhiana police a few days ago.

3,Teachers flay transfer policy,"PATNA: The teachers union has criticised the new transfer policy for the government secondary teachers and warned that it would create anarchy in the education department similar to the one witnessed in 1995.

The Bihar Madhyamik Sikshak Sangh leaders, including MLC Kedar Nath Pandey, warned that the new transfer policy would lead to a large number of court cases resulting in breakdown of the education system.

The leaders said the new transfer policy was full of contradictions. It states that the teachers would have to return to the school where they were posted on April 28, 1988. â€œIt does not speak about the teachers who were posted in Jharkhand at that time.

The leaders pointed out that the new policy also does not specify what happens to the seniority of teachers who had taken transfers forfeiting their seniority. They appealed to the state government to introduce the central transfer policy which gives freedom to teachers to make their choice about the place of transfer.

4,New laws to check spurious drugs,"NEW DELHI: The Union government seems to have finally woken up to the unabated sale of spurious drugs all over the country.

The government is re-working laws so that it no longer remains a minor offence but has enough severity to deal with it as a criminal act.

Union minister for health and family welfare Shatrughan Sinha, who has taken a serious view of the large-scale sale of spurious drugs, said this was worse than any other crime as a single batch of drugs could potentially kill several people.

â€˜â€˜This activity is anti-national and anti-poor,â€™â€™ said Sinha and described those selling these drugs as â€˜â€˜lashon ke saudagar (merchants of death)â€™â€™. He said they should be dealt with severely as it was the only way to check such a heinous crime. Under the present law, a person could be let off with a simple imprisonment of two to three years and some fine.

Sinha said the punishment would be made so strict that it would be a deterrant by itself. At the same time, steps would also be taken to create special cells, headed by the director-general of police, in all states, which could coordinate with state drug controllers and help in nabbing the culprits.

This uninhibited sale of spurious drugs flourishes right under the nose of the Union as well as the state government in Delhi itself. In a raid conducted last year, drug inspectors, who lifted 53 samples from places in and around Bhagirath Palace, found only four to be genuine.

These included life-saving medicines as well. Samples of life-saving antibiotic Ciprofloxacin was found with only 0.2 per cent of the medicinal ingredient. This drug is also prescribed for drug-resistant tuberculosis and with such trade in spurious drugs, the implications could be serious.

Even Delhi state health minister, Dr A K Walia, has written to the Centre to take strong measures on the ongoing trade in Delhi. Sinha said the Union health ministry is already working on the draft of amendments to incorporate the proposed changes in the Drugs and Cosmetics Act.

As for taking urgent steps in Delhi, he said, â€˜â€˜I appreciate and support their writing to me. But when they talk about trade in Delhi, the Delhi government should itself go in for stringent action.â€™â€™

5,$400 mn investment norm for oil retailing: Naik,"RIO DE JANEIRO: Private companies intending to sell petrol and diesel in India would have to mandatorily invest $400 million over a period of 10 years in setting up oil infrastructure projects, Petroleum Minister Ram Naik said here.

""New parties which have invested or propose to invest $400 million over a period of 10 years in oil exploration, refinery construction, laying pipelines and terminals would only be authorised to market transportation fuels - petrol, diesel and aviation turbine fuel,"" Naik, who was here to attend the 17th World Petroleum Congress, said.

Money spent in acquisition of companies would not qualify for grant of authorisation to retail petrol and diesel.

Naik''s statement comes at a time when the government is firming up disinvestment plans for state-run oil retailers Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum. This would mean that private companies, other than those which have invested Rs 2,000 crore in the oil sector, would have to make additional investment over and above the acquisition price.

Naik said that the government had already granted marketing rights to private sector Reliance Industries and Essar Oil in addition to state-run Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) and Numaligarh Refinery (NRL).

""These companies have been allowed to set up 8,659 retail outlets. This marks a 40 per cent increase over the existing retail outlet strength of 18,848 operated by the existing four state oil marketing companies,"" he added.

Stating that the demand for petroleum products was increasing at an annual rate of 5 per cent, Naik said that the government had stepped up exploration for oil and gas through the newly formulated New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP).

Fourty-seven exploration blocks had been awarded since 2000 under the policy and bids for another 23 blocks had been received, he said.

India currently imports 70 per cent of its 100 million tonnes crude oil requirement.

""Apart from exploration of oil and gas within the country, efforts are on to enhance oil security by acquiring equity oil abroad,"" he said.

ONGC Videsh has acquired 20 per cent stake in Sakhlain-I, which will give India four to six million tonnes of oil from 2005.

Naik further said that the government had recently approved acquisition of 25 per cent stake in the Greater Nile Oil Project in Oman.

""This is a producing field and the country will receive three million tonnes of oil per year as soon as the final agreement is reached,"" he said.

To protect the environment and promote sustainable development, Naik said that the government was expanding the reach of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) to rural areas through the launch of smaller 5-kg cylinder.

There are a total of 63.5 million LPG consumers in the country at present covering about 30 per cent of the population.

6,Expedite pending projects: BJP to govt,"HYDERABAD: The BJP on Wednesday asked the state government to expedite the construction of the pending irrigation projects in the light of the Supreme Courtâ€™s judgement on Telugu Ganga and Srisailam Left Bank Canal projects.

Addressing a press conference, state BJP vice-president S V Seshagiri Rao told the government to speed up the execution of the pending projects.

Foreseeing the possibility of appointment of a new tribunal, Rao told the government to be cautious about the introduction of new clauses in adjudication.

â€œIn the past, the state government failed to present our case properly before the Bachawat tribunal. Hence, we were asked to transfer the Krishna-Godavari inter-basin waters to both Karnataka and Maharashtra,â€� he said.

BJP Legislature Party leader N Indrasena Reddy has asked the government to review the budget proposals so as to allocate more funds for the construction of the irrigation projects on the Krishna river. He wanted the government to involve private parties in the construction of irrigation projects.

7,Shourie meets Fernandes over disinvestment imbroglio,"NEW DELHI: In a bid to break the impasse over the disinvestment programme, particularly relating to sale of equity in oil PSUs, Disinvestment Minister Arun Shourie had a meeting with Defence Minister George Fernandes, who sought policy review for any course correction that might be needed.

The two ministers met here on Thursday, a day after Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee took initiative to resolve the differences by holding a meeting with Fernandes along with Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani and Finance Minister Jaswant Singh.

When contacted, Shourie, who was on way to Mumbai, said that he had a meeting with Fernandes but declined to give details.

The meeting is believed to have been the outcome of the mediation of BJP Spokesperson Arun Jaitley in a bid to bring about a consensus on the disinvestment issues.

Fernandes and Shourie met for the first time since the former wrote a letter to Vajpayee late in August raising certain issues including a discussion among key ministers for a review of the policy and progress, which is reported to have led to postponement of the scheduled meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Disinvestment (CCD) from August 27 till September 7.

It is understood that Fernandes sought a rationale for disinvestment ministry to push ahead with the strategic sale route while suggesting that they should also consider other options like public offer to prevent creation of any private monopoly.

Neither Fernandes nor Jaitley, who is presently in Bhopal, could be contacted for comments.

Sources indicated that yesterday''s meeting was an attempt by Shourie to win over Fernandes ahead of the crucial CCD meeting which would be preceded by another round of informal consultations by Vajpayee with key ministers including Shourie and Petroleum Minister Ram Naik.

Although, the outcome of the meeting between Shourie and Fernandes, presumably on the directive from Vajpayee, was not known, informed sources said that it would help bring about a much desired consensus on various issues to continue the disinvestment momentum.

Earlier, Jaitley had said the BJP was totally supportive of disinvestment programme but added that it was for the collective wisdom of the government to decide as to which PSUs to be divested and what methodology to be adopted.

Shourie, who had said that the opposition to disinvestment was mainly due to corporate rivalry, had been pushing for keeping the PSUs out of the divestment process, whereas Naik has been insisting that oil PSUs be allowed to bid for Hindustan Petroleum and Bharat Petroleum.

Naik has also insisted that sale of equity in the two oil PSUs be done through public offer route instead of strategic sale.

10,Lawless violence cannot be justified: Kalam,"BHOPAL: In a span of just a fortnight, President A P J Abdul Kalam on Thursday again expressed concern about growing ""intolerance and contempt"" for others'' religions and spoke out against justification of ""lawless violence"".

He also had a word for judiciary saying it could not be a ""mute witness"" to devaluation of human life.

""The increasing intolerance for views of others and increasing contempt about ways of lives of others or their religions or the expressions of these differences through lawless violence against people cannot be justified in any context,"" Kalam said inaugurating the National Judicial Academy here.

He said that every citizen in the country had a right to live with dignity and aspire for distinction.

""Availability of a large number of opportunities to resort to just and fair means in order to attain the dignity and distinction is what our constitution is all about. And that is what makes life wholesome and worth living in a true and vibrant democracy,"" he said.

The President added that at social levels it was necessary to work for ""unity of minds"" and everyone should make his behaviour civilised to protect the rights of each individual.

""That is the very foundation of the democratic values, which I believe is our part of our heritage and is the very soul of our nation. Judiciary is the guardian of civilised life. Wherever life exists on our planet no life can be allowed to be devalued by anybody. Particularly, the judiciary cannot be a mute witness to this inhuman act,"" he said.

Describing the judiciary as the ""angel and marshal"" that ensured democracy survived, Kalam said that it was the whole process of interpreting social, political, economical and human environment to ensure that wholesome life with dignity and distinction was sustained.

""There cannot be any erosion of values, corrosion of quality or any cobwebs in the procedure. The majesty of law and justice has to be maintained with magnanimity and magnificence. The members of the Judiciary, therefore, become inviolable role models, the perfect incorruptible ideals of a civilised society. It is this that we have to strive for, attain and sustain,"" he said.

Spelling out ""essential needs"" for a developed India, the President said that GDP growth should be targeted at 9 per cent annually with the number of people below poverty line reduced to nil or a very small part and near self-reliance in defence needs achieved without any ""umbilical"" attached to the outside world.

""India has to be economically and commercially powerful, at least to be one of the four top nations in terms of size of the economy... There should be large opportunities for all our people to have a prosperous life,"" Kalam said.

The President further said that Technology Vision 2020, comprising 17 technology packages in core sectors, was a ""pathway to realise this cherished mission"".

Resenting that developed countries were trying to make laws and treaties to protect their national interests and priorities instead of working for win-win partnerships, Kalam said that India should work for win-win situations even in business and trade with ethics.

He said that there was need to innovate on new laws to suit the Indian environment to solve the country''s specific problems and accelerate overall development as several laws were framed on basis of similar ones in Britain.

Referring to trade related aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), he said that laws would have to be framed to meet international obligations under it and suitable systems set up to deal with such cases with knowledgeable judges.

He added that laws were framed to ensure equality of opportunities to all and fair practice in trade and related dealings and since India was on the path of rapid industrial and technological advancements, laws had to provide adequate protection in this endeavour.

Kalam also said that there was need for a law for protection of Indian space above 30 km altitude as the International Law on space may not be sufficient.

""As new scientific and technological knowledge as in bio-technology, brain research, sensors and high performance computing systems come into operation, new laws to balance the interest of people of today and the future generations as well as present and future interests of the nation have to be brought about,"" he added.

Commenting on restrictive or discriminatory laws by developed countries, Kalam said that an ""unbalanced"" world order was something on which the legal luminaries might have to think while framing commitments to international treaties.

11,What led to Antony govt's volte face,"THIRUVANANANTHAPURAM: The UDF government''s rollback of the hike in power charges announced last week marked its first climbdown on a major issue under public pressure in 15 months, while leaving unanswered the vital question of how Kerala is going to resolve the grim power crisis it faces.

Widespread public resentment over the level of the increase and the violent turn of the opposition-sponsored agitation were cited by Chief Minister A K Antony as reasons to reverse the decision, but observers here say the ""power-play"" within the Congress and differences among the UDF partners too contributed to the turn of events.

During the two earlier agitations it had faced -- the tribal land right stir and the month-long all-union staff strike -- the government had pulled through unscathed.

In the case of tribal stir, Antony could bring the agitators round to a temporary truce and the government employees were forced to call off their agitation, accepting face-saving cencessions.

The power tariff hike, however, upset the calculations, as it triggered instant protest from the entire political spectrum, though it was the youth outfits of LDF and the BJP who took to streets and went on rampage.

Wrong signals emanating from sections of the ruling UDF coupled with the Karunakaran camp in the Congress bringing factional pressures weakened the position of the chief minister further, compelling him to have a re-look at the matter.

12,Mandya farmers will be hit hardest,"MYSORE: The Supreme Court order directing Karnataka to release 1.25 tmcft of Cauvery water to Tamil Nadu has come as a bolt from the blue to the farmers of this region, especially those who have raised sugarcane and paddy.

Sugarcane growers will be hit hard due to the imminent shortage of water.

If the officials'' version is to be believed, there seems to be truth in the fears being expressed by the farmers and their leaders that their standing sugarcane, paddy in Krishnarajsagar and other semi-dry crops in Kabini, Harangi and Hemavathy ayacut areas will wither away.

According to sources, unlike last year, water storage in these dams is very less. Officials felt that unrest will sweep across the region, but would be severe in Mandya district where farmers are mainly dependent on the water from Krishnarajsagar dam for their agricultural needs.

Farmers'' leader Mallesh said that this time, not only Mandya farmers, everybody in the region will protest. ""When the government is snatching away our daily bread, everybody will rise in revolt.""

Many farmers'' leaders feel that on earlier occasions also, the state has released water to Tamil Nadu, but it has been done in January or February by which time the farmers harvest their kharif crops and sugarcane.

But what has left the farmers dumbfounded now is the SC verdict coming midway their kharif crops. The decision will also affect sugar factories and rice mills in the region.

On the other hand, the city corporation and the water board are also a worried lot over the imminent shortage of drinking water.

``Last year, the Krishnarajsagar Dam remained full for more than four months and the level started receding only in January to reach its lowest in June this year. But it appears that if the water is released everyday, by December-end, the dams will go empty forcing the people to starve,"" said a senior engineer of water board predicting unprecedented drinking water crisis in Mysore and other cities and towns which are wholly dependent on Cauvery water.

13,Kharge rules out chief for STF,"BANGALORE: Home Minister Mallikarjun M. Kharge on Thursday ruled out the appointment of a chief for the STF after IPS officer R.P. Sharma was relieved from the post.

Kharge told reporters: ``The DGP -- the top police man in the state -- is himself looking after the operations; there is no need for anyone else.''''

He said the department of personnel and administrative reforms (DPAR) is examining ``whether Sharma''s public criticism of DGP V.V. Bhaskar amounts to misconduct and indiscipline.'''' The Times of India had reported on Monday that Sharma, as STF chief, had asked for protection to targets mentioned in the Arakesh report, but this was not given due importance.

Prior to the report, Sharma had been given oral permission to leave for the US to join a programme on explosives. This permission was withdrawn subsequently.

Sharma, though relieved of his STF posting, has still not been given a post.

Kharge said: ``I don''t know'''' when asked about the status of Sharma''s US trip.

If Kharge and DGP Bhaskar had their way, they would have got Sharma suspended on the charge of leaking classified documents. But Chief Minister S.M. Krishna, who initially agreed to this, shot it down later saying long-term goals are more important than short-term ones.

Kharge and Bhaskar took a typed proposal to the CM''s office. Krishna asked them to leave the file with him. But in the evening, the CM changed his mind, sources said.

Sharma was seen waiting in front of the CM''s cabin in Vidhana Soudha on Wednesday when the drama was taking place. He was there to explain his stand, sources said.

14,Ayodhya Nagar Development Trust set up,"AYODHYA: A marathon three-day meeting between representatives of Muslims living in Ayodhya and Faizabad and Shankaracharya Jayendra Saraswati held at Kanchipuram in Tamil Nadu last week has resulted in the formation of Kanchi Ayodhya Nagar Development Trust.

The trust, formed for the overall development of the twin cities of Ayodhya and Faizabad, would provide vocational training to youths, help them in setting up small-scale industries and construction of houses, try to improve medical infrastructure and promote education in the district.

Terming it as a confidence building measure between both the communities in the country in general and in Ayodhya in particular, Mohd Yunus Siddiqui, convenor of the Babri Masjid Action Committee and member of the visiting team, said that the situation today would have totally different had Shankaracharya intervened in Ayodhya issue a decade ago. He said that the Kanchi seer felt that the involvement of members of both the communities in developmental projects of Ayodhya would pave the way for communal harmony.

Khaliq said that the seerâ€™s offer for the formation of Kanchi Ayodhya Nagar Development Trust was not only in the spirit of brotherhood but was also in the spirit of Indian constitution. The fundamental duties (Part IV A) Article 51 A (e) of Constitution directed every citizen to promote harmony and the spirit of brotherhood, he added.

He further said that the trust with maximum 11 trustees, including three members of Muslims community and saints, would strive to provide basic amenities to the general public and work for the overall development in the twin cities. He said that the meeting reached to the consensus that â€œa solution to the controversial Ram Janmabhoomi could be brought about only on the initiative of the people holding high posts in society.â€�

Khaliq said that other issues that were also discussed with the Kanchi seer included Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act 1937, Waqf Act, Places of Worship Act 1991, Religious Institution Act 1988 and atrocities on minority community in Gujarat riots.

Initially, six persons, including two saints, three local representatives of the Muslim community and a representative of the Kanchi Math, would be nominated to the trust.

Members of the delegation, which visited Kanchi, were Khaliq Ahmad Khan, Kehkashan Jabeen, Mohd Yunus Siddiqui Jamal Ahmad and Syed Hassan Raja, a Shia leader.
