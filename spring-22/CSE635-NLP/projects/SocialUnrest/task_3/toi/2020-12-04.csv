0,Cong ready for early LS elections,"NEW DELHI: The Congress is banking on the working of a ""cyclical pattern"" in elections whereby if it has lost this round it could win the next. So, no heads may roll for the assembly poll debacle as the party gets ready for the Lok Sabha elections which it expects to be advanced.

â€˜â€˜If these elections were the semi-finals as Prime Minister Vajpayee said, we are ready for the finals. Let Lok Sabha elections be held in March,â€™â€™ party spokesman Jaipal Reddy told reporters on Thursday.

While his reaction was analytical, that of party chief Sonia Gandhi was direct. Expressing â€˜â€˜deep disappointmentâ€™â€™ over her partyâ€™s reverses in the assembly elections, she said the party would have â€˜â€˜to pull up its socksâ€™â€™ for the big electoral battle ahead.

Asserting that the party has â€˜â€˜not lost hopeâ€™â€™, Gandhi told reporters, â€˜â€˜People expected much more from us. Obviously, we could not perform up to their expectations.â€™â€™

The results in Delhi were a shot in the arm, the outcome.

1,"Focus on wire theft, education policy","LUCKNOW: Large-scale theft of electricity wire and transformers in Aligarh and the defective policy being pursued in the filling up of vacant posts in secondary education-aided schools dominated the proceedings of the Vidhan Parishad on Thursday.

Failure of many elected representatives to cast votes in the recently held Vidhan Parishad polls was also raised.

The issue of theft of electricity wire was raised by Nepal Singh, Sheema Rizvi, Ramji Singh and others of the BJP who said the growing incidents of theft in the district was adversely affecting crops particularly wheat as the tubewells could not function in the absence of power.

They quoted the incident of Chandaula in Atrauli where the electricity wire of private tube wells was stolen as also that of a 3300 volt line. The legislators said the police had till date been unable to catch the culprits or put a check on the growing number of such cases.

Referring to the standing crop in the fields, the MLCs said they were being adversely affected in the absence of water supply.

Replying to the same, minister for food and civil supplies Ashok Bajpai said a concerted drive would be launched to put a check on these incidents and FIRs would be lodged against those found stealing wire or transformers.

He said the issue was a cause of concern for not only the BJP but for the whole state as a lot of effort went into electrifying a village or district. Acting chairman Manvendra Singh directed that necessary action be taken on the issue and the House be apprised of the same.

Om Prakash Sharma, Subhash Chandra Sharma and others of the teachersâ€™ group drew attention to the faulty policies being adopted in the filling up of vacancies of principals, teachers and other employees of the secondary education-aided schools.

They said as a consequence of the faulty policy around 20,000 cases were pending in courts and employees of these schools were unable to attend to their routine business, engaged as they were in pursuing these cases.

Leader of the House Bhagwati Singh said a report on this had been sought from the director, education and the same would be placed in the House.

Om Prakash Sharma raised serious objections to the failure of Bhagwati Singh to give a satisfactory reply on what amendments had actually been carried out in the Civil Procedure Code Ordinance 2003. The issue would now be taken up on Friday.

Earlier, raising the question of propriety during Zero Hour, Panchanan Rai said many elected representatives could not cast their vote in the December 1 Parishad polls following anomalies in the votersâ€™ list.

He quoted the specific case of Azamgarh-Mau in this connection. Joining hands on the issue, Ramji Singh of the BJP said he planned to stage a dharna.

2,I'll quit politics after two years: Jogi,"RAIPUR: ""Karuna"", the official residence of Chhattisgarh chief minister Ajit Jogi, wore a deserted look on Thursday as trends from different constituencies confirmed that the BJP would win the elections. Later, speaking to reporters, a morose Ajit Jogi announced that he would remain in Chhattisgarh but would quit politics after two years.

Wishing the new BJP CM all success, Jogi hoped that his successor would fulfil his â€˜â€˜unfinished mission of making Chhattisgarh a developed stateâ€™â€™.

Jogi promised that the Congress would play the role of a constructive Opposition.

He took full responsibility for the defeat of the party, but admitted that he had not anticipated the results would be so poor. He claimed the party lost because of poor performance in the Naxalite affected belts of Bastar and Surguja where the Congress failed to mark its presence in 20 seats.

â€˜â€˜We lost miserably in Naxalite affected areas, where awareness is very low,â€™â€™ he remarked.

He said he would not leave Chhattisgarh, contrary to what BJP leaders were saying. â€˜â€˜I am totally committed to Chhattisgarh. It is my motherland, my birthplace,â€™â€™ Jogi said.

He also confirmed his earlier announcement that he would retire from public life after turning 60.

3,‘Manipulate law in your favour’,"LUCKNOW: If men can manipulate law in their favour, why canâ€™t women.

Instead of a monthly payment of maintenance amount to the wives after divorce, the latter can also ask for a lifetime settlement amount.

There have been cases where men â€˜resignedâ€™ from their jobs and claimed maintenance from their wives to exploit â€˜equality statusâ€™ of Hindu Marriage Act.

An officer in a known NGO in city has â€˜depictedâ€™ as he has lost his job only to avoid payment of maintenance to wives despite the court order.

Regardless of the fact that law is tilted in favour of patriarchy, there is still scope to manoeuvre it in favour of women.

While expressing these views, Flavia Agnes, human right activist and a Mumbai based advocate, said that legal process could be utilised for empowerment of women.

Addressing a workshop, organised by the institute of women studies, Lucknow University, on â€œViolence Against Women and Legislative Reformsâ€� and â€œFamily Law and Uniform Civil Code,â€� she said that a good lawyer was supposed to be one who wins cases and not who follows ethics.

Since law says that the guilt should be proven â€˜beyond reasonable doubtâ€™, in rape and divorce cases, lawyers frame questions which could create doubts on womanâ€™s character.

â€œWhile using legal process in favour of women, there should be no dishonesty and true facts should be told to the court,â€� she said.

7,Bihar ministers urge DGP Ojha's removal,"PATNA: Incensed over the continuing outburst of director general of police D P Ojha against politicians, all members of the state cabinet on Thursday requested Chief Minister Rabri Devi to remove Ojha and initiate departmental proceedings against him.

Raising the issue during the cabinet meeting, the ministers took strong exception to the recent remarks of Ojha and told the Chief Minister, ""Enough is enough. We have had enough from the DGP. Now it is high time the top cop is replaced and departmental proceedings initiated against him at once.""

Giving this information after the cabinet meeting, a minister told Times News Network that they had taken strong objections to the DGP''s remark at Sonepur fair last month that ""lafange ka raj hai (lumpens are ruling the state)"".

The minister said that the issue was first raised by excise minister Shivanand Tiwari, who got support from all the ministers present.

In fact, the cabinet meeting saw an acrimonious scene just after the agenda was taken up.

The ministers told the Chief Minister that the sweeping remarks of Ojha cast aspersions on all of them and should not be taken casually. Not only were the remarks against the service code, they amounted to insult of the elected government.

It would be unfortunate if the government failed to take action against the DGP, the ministers added.

One of the ministers, in fact, expressed surprise over the stand taken by the DGP when he is on the verge of retirement.

He wondered, ""Ojha never accused politicians while he was posted in the vigilance bureau for about 13-14 years. What has now prompted him to suddenly spew venom against politicians when he is scheduled to superannuate in another two months?""

The meeting was adjourned after the chief minister announced that she would look into the matter.

Sources said that the government may initiate departmental proceedings against Ojha as suggested by the CBI in connection with the fodder scam.

10,SC rules in favour of migrants from Pak,"NEW DELHI: Ruling in favour of 30 Pakistani nationals who migrated to Rajasthan during the 1965 Indo-Pak warâ€” and against a group of Indian landless labourersâ€”the Supreme Court has said the Pakistanis were entitled to cultivate land allotted to them temporarily over three decades ago.

Declaring that the Indian landless labourers had no claim over the holding, the court, however, said the state government could consider allotment of land to them for cultivation, if it was available.

The judgment by a Bench of justices Ruma Pal and P V Reddi is a fallout of the state governmentâ€™s appeal challenging a Rajasthan High Court order. The HC order said: â€˜â€˜This was a fit case where the state authorities may consider the case of the petitioners for regularisation of the lands in their favour.

12,30 govt doctors face dept action,"PANCHKULA: Continuing with its move of curbing the practice of promoting branded medicines, the health authorities are getting tough with doctors of government hospitals and health centres.

In a recent communication, Dr B S Dahiya, director general of health services (DGHS) has recommended disciplinary action against 30-odd senior medical officers (SMOs) and medical officers (MOs) of government health institutions across the state that were found guilty of allegedly prescribing branded medicines.

The figure includes three doctors of Kalka hospital whose prescription slips were found from two chemists shops during a raid by drug control department officials.

â€˜â€˜They did not comply with the orders discouraging the promotion of branded medicines. They were instead, found to be party to it during the surprise checks conducted by officials of the drug control department,â€™â€™ Dahiya pointed out.

Enquiries revealed that of the doctors against whom the DGHS has recommended department action, eight are from Sirsa, seven from Jind, four from Rewari and three each from Karnal, Panipat and Panchkula (Kalka).

Sources said the action has been initiated after receiving reports from civil surgeons of these districts. Officials of drug control department had conducted raids on chemists shops near the health centres or hospital, and had confiscated some prescription slips, which were verified by the team of officials of the office of civil surgeon of the concerned district.

The move to curb prescription of branded medicines began this July when a team of health department raided chemists to check alleged overpricing of medicines.

Following this, the pharmaceutical companies were asked to justify their policy of offering a whopping margin to retailers.

The companies failed to convince the health authorities and the latter initiated criminal action against seven of the companies.
