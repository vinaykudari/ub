1,Help farmers: Minister asks agro firms,"PUNE: Union minister of state for finance Balasaheb Vikhe-Patil on Sunday said corporate houses which are into agro business should act as trustees between the farmer and traders.

Delivering the inaugural address of the agro business management course being conducted by the Ivy league Cornell University and Sathguru, Vikhe-Patil said sustaining the farmer was more important than maintaining the farm.

He lamented the presence of too many middlemen in agro business.

It is imperative that farmers get a bigger share in agribusiness so that they too grow with corporate houses and traders, Vikhe-Patil said.

However, he was quick to contend that corporates assuming the role of patrons should understand their social responsibility in terms of product pricing.

Vikhe-Patil said failure to adapt to modern technology at the field level, out-dated post-harvest practices and insufficient packaging and handling facilities were bottlenecks which should be removed on a priority basis.

The unreliable market information system also came under flak from the minister.

Vikhe-Patil said agriculture universities in India should invite private companies in the sector to jointly run courses. Citing the example of Cornell University, which has a strong agriculture faculty, he said private sector in agriculture universities will give a boost to research activity.

â€œThe involvement of corporates in the curriculum would inject enterprise into agriculture development efforts,â€� he added.

2,Subscribers flay govt over sealing cable operator,"PUNE: Grahak Hitvardhini, a city-based organisation of cable subscribers, on Sunday condemned the sealing of Pune Associated Cable networkâ€™s control room, saying consumers, who promptly pay subscription fees, should not be held to ransom for cable operatorsâ€™ defaults.

Entertainment officer Sanjay Kundetkar had on Saturday sealed the control room of PAC after its members failed to pay entertainment duty arrears of Rs 55 lakh.

However, PAC director Vasant Patwardhan claimed that its members owed only Rs 5 lakh to the government.

â€œThe handful who havenâ€™t paid it have been asked to clear their dues by Tuesday,â€� he said.

Grahak Hitvardhini will take up the issue in the Bombay high court on Monday when its writ petition against stopping signals of subscribers for recovery of entertainment tax comes up for hearing.

Sudhakar Velankar, president of the organisation, remarked that the entertainment duty officer should not have sealed the control room when the matter was sub-judice.

Velankar also challenged the method of charging entertainment tax per connection.

â€œThe Bombay Entertainment Duty Act, 1923, clearly stipulates that the government should levy only 25 per cent entertainment duty on a proprietorâ€™s gross revenue,â€� he said.

As such, the government has no legal authority to charge entertainment duty at a flat rate, Velankar said.

3,Principal builds reading room from her own pocket,"DARBHANGA: The principal of the local M R Mahila College, Savita Rani, is doing what the University Grants Commission and L N Mithila University administration could not do.

She is constructing a reading hall for the students of her college with her own money.

The students of the only womenâ€™s constituent college in the town did not have a reading hall attached to the college library. Consequently, the students were forced to read in the open field after borrowing books from the library. They had been pressing hard the college administration for a reading hall for the last many years. The college reportedly made several requests to the LNMU authorities either to grant the requisite fund or to approach the UGC for the grant. However, this could not materialise, and the successive principals of the college remained helpless.

Finally, the present principal, who is retiring from service on July 31 next, decided to get the reading hall constructed on the roof of the library building with her own money. As the approval of the university was needed for this, she wrote a letter to the vice-chancellor. Her request was put up before the syndicate which, at its meeting on April 13 last, gave the approval for construction with profuse thanks to the principal for this noble venture.

A jubilant principal started the construction of the hall estimated to cost about Rs 1.30 lakh. The construction is going on, and the principal has already spent Rs 60,000 of her money on this venture. She is determined to complete the building and hand it over to the college before she retires.

When contacted, Savita Rani told this correspondent that everyone spends money for his or her children but one should also spend money for the children in society. â€œAll the college students are like my daughters, and they were in need of a reading hall.

Hence, I thought that I should construct a hall for them,â€� said the principal, adding that by doing this she has contributed a little to the college which has been providing her with bread and butter throughout her service.

Savita Rani is not alone in donating money for institutional development.Former head of the post-graduate department of Hindi Ajit Kumar Verma has donated Rs 25,000 to LNMU for its campus development.

Verma''s constituency, which is among the largest in the country, was considered a stronghold of the Congress but it was Verma who turned it around in BJP''s favour.

A minister under Madan Lal Khurana in 1993, he took over the mantle from Khurana who resigned in the wake of the hawala scam.

Verma''s brief tenure as Chief Minister lasted two years from 1996-98 and he stepped down in favour of party colleague Sushma Swaraj.

12,3-seater rickshaws to hold demonstrations,"PUNE: Three-seater rickshaws'' union Rickshaw Panchayat will hold demonstrations in front of the regional transport office (RTO) on July 3 to protest against the harassment of drivers during RTO''s on-going drive to curb unsafe transport of school-children in rickshaws.

Spokesman Nitin Pawar told this paper that the demonstrations will be held at 1 pm. ""However, rickshaws will not be on strike on the day,"" he clarified, adding that the time had been chosen carefully to avoid any inconvenience to students.

Pawar said the RTO had so far detained around 250 three-seaters for not taking safety precautions while transporting students. But RTO officials have also taken action against rickshaws following instructions to the letter, he said. ""The union will not support rickshaws ferrying more than 10 students at a time and those who have no side grills and additional seating boards,"" he added.

The RTO should determine the number of students to be carried in a rickshaw before taking any action, Pawar remarked. ""The regional transport authority had suggested the state transport authority in January 2001 to allow rickshaws to ferry ten students. The decision on the suggestion is still pending,"" Pawar claimed.

13,Cops can't arrest docs on negligence charges: CM,"KOLKATA: The beleaguered medical fraternity can take heart from the chief ministerâ€™s assurance. The government has instructed the police not to accept FIRs against doctors and to desist from making arrests on the basis of stray complaints, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee told members of the Indian Medical Association on Monday.

""The police are not the competent authority to decide the guilt of a doctor. This is a matter of much greater significance and needs to be determined by a competent authority,"" he said.

To what must be music to the doctorsâ€™ ears, Bhattacharjee said cases of medical negligence were highly technical and beyond understanding of the common man. ""I have spoken to health minister Surjya Kanta Misra and we have decided that either the state medical council or a doctorsâ€™ body has to decide on cases of negligence,"" he said.

Government hospitals should also allot time each day to brief the relatives of patients. ""We have instructed doctors to speak to patientsâ€™ relatives every day and clearly explain the disease and treatment,"" Misra said. He exhorted the doctors to behave in a more sympathetic manner with patients and their relatives. ""Sympathy towards families of patients can help solve misunderstanding between common people and the doctors,"" he said.

Bhattacharjee and Misra reiterated that discipline would be enforced at any cost in government hospitals. ""We will not allow any kind of indiscipline,"" said Bhattacharjee. The health minister emphasised that co-ordination between private and government sector hospitals is essential.

""Our private hospitals may not match their counterparts in other states, but our government hospitals are among the best,"" he added.

14,Pensioners suffer due to poor govt records,"PUNE: * Late Balkrishna Tulpule was a teacher at a city school during 1934-1965 and opted for voluntary retirement. Since no VRS facility was available in the sixties, he had no other option but to resign from the post. Although rules stipulate pension for those taking voluntary retirement, the state government denied him pension because he ""resigned"". His 82-year-old wife Mangala, who has no source of living, is still fighting for the pension.

* Madhukar Parkhi (83) retired as an executive engineer from irrigation research division in 1977. He applied to get the his pension revised as per the fifth pay commission in January 2000. His application is gathering dust in his old office because records of his service are not available for verification. Parkhi is suffering a monthly loss of Rs 1,000.

* Jagannath Kalunge (82) worked as a teacher in Satara from 1945 to 1960 before being transferred to an zilla parishad-run Ashramshala as superintendent where he worked till 1980. His pension claim has been rejected on the ground that he ""left"" the teaching profession.

Records of city-based Maharashtra Pensioners'' Association (MPA) are full of stories that highlight apathy, delays and callous attitude of the government in settling claims of pensioners. But people who retired before 1986 seem to be suffering the most while seeking revision of their pensions as per the fifth pay commission.

According to Madhukar Lokur, working president of MPA, out of the five lakh state government pensioners, around two lakh belong to the pre-1986 category. Service records of 75,000 pensioners, majority of whom are from police and education departments, couldn''t be found. As such, their applications for pension revision are languishing. ""Around 40,000 pensioners died during 1996-2001 while waiting to get their pensions revised,"" Lokur said, adding that their spouses, who are in their eighties, now have the unenviable task of fighting for their rightful claim.

When asked about the reasons for the delay, Lokur said, ""The process of revision is deplorable to say the least. Applicants have to submit their forms to offices where they were working at the time of retirement. These offices are supposed to scrutinise their service records and forward the forms to their heads who, in turn, forward them to the accountant general (AG). The AG then prescribes the pension amount and sends it to the treasury, which makes the payment to payee banks.""

""The problem starts at the scrutiny stage as many offices do not have old records. If the pensioner dies in the interim period the spouse has to supply information about his pay scale, salary, years of service and location of office at the time of retirement before he/she gets family pension,"" Lokur revealed, adding that not many wives knew these details. ""During old times women were not supposed to ask these details to their husbands,"" he pointed out.

In a meeting with government officials last week, MPA suggested that since the posts of these pensioners were known to government, their revised pension can be worked out on the basis of salary scale proposed for that post by the fifth pay commission. ""The response to this suggestion was not enthusiastic, which makes us wonder whether the government really wants to settle the claims,"" Lokur remarked.

16,"Boycotting polls is unlawful, says Jamiat chief","SRINAGAR: Describing poll boycott as unlawful, the Jammu and Kashmir Jamiat-e-Islami chief Gulam Mohammad Bhat said the party may join the democratic process next time.

However, he made it clear that they did not have any plans to participate in the elections this time. He said the elections in Jammu and Kashmir were never free and fair due to which he had lost faith in the electoral process.

We have had a bitter experience of fighting the elections. I myself contested for Lok Sabha from Baramulla constituency but every time rigging took place, the Jamiat-e-Islami chief said.

Referring to the recent statement of the chief election commissioner, Bhat said forcing people to vote or telling them not to participate in the polls was against law.

He said Jamiat-e-Islami did not believe in unlawful activities. There is no compulsion in religion, a local newspaper quoted Gulam Mohammad Bhat as saying.

Distancing himself and his party from the Hizbul Mujahideen militant outfit, Bhat claimed that Jamiat had no connection with it. He said all their leaders were in jail and therefore could not contest Hizb chief Master Ashan Darâ€™s statement that we were an armed wing of Jamiat.

Castigating Pakistan, Bhat said it had never been an Islamic country.

He said Jamiat believed in dialogue and never preached militancy as the solution of the Kashmir problem. He added that his party did not want Kashmir to fall into Pakistanâ€™s hands.
