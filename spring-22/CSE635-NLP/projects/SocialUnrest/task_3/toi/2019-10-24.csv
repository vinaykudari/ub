0,India seeks stricter immigration laws,"NEW DELHI: India on Wednesday sought stricter immigration checks and controls to tackle fugitives and ring leaders of transnational organised crime. It also sought special global legislation for confiscation of property acquired through criminal activities by such elements.

Addressing the 71st general assembly meeting of the Interpol in Cameroon, CBI director P C Sharma identified extradition as the greatest tool to bring culprits to justice. But this was also, he said, the biggest problem area for law enforcement agencies.

â€˜â€˜A large number of countries have not entered into extradition treaties. And even where such treaties exist, they are mostly embroiled in complicated procedures leading to delays,â€™â€™ Sharma said. He called for enactment of a model legislation on forfeiture of property acquired through criminal means by all countries.

He said countries where international terrorists and transnational criminals find havens need to be identified. â€˜â€˜With closer immigration checks and better information-sharing, these steps would go a long way in controlling the movement of criminals and terrorists and result in effective interception,â€™â€™ Sharma said.

The CBI is facing some difficulty in trying to extradite underworld criminal Abu Salem, the main accused in the Mumbai blasts case, and his girlfriend, Monica Bedi, from Portugal. They were arrested in Portugal on September 20 and were charged with possessing false travel documents.

Later, the CBI provided the Portuguese agencies with several documents, including finger-prints, to establish Salemâ€™s criminal past.

Meanwhile, with the 90-day deadline for keeping Salem behind bars in Portugal nearing, the Centre has asked the state governments and their police forces to speedily provide all relevant criminal records and documents to make a strong case for his extradition to India.

1,Rane takes govt. to task for fiscal ‘mismanagement’,"MUMBAI: Narayan Tatu Rane has always been knownâ€”and admiredâ€”in the stateâ€™s political and administrative circles for his passion for facts, figures and finery.

As chairman of the municipalised BEST committee in the late 1980s, Rane would spend hours with senior bureaucrats piecing together the nut, bolt and the chassis of the BESTâ€™s account books.

The leader of the opposition has yet again marshalled his drafting skills to take the ruling DF government to task for the â€˜mismanagementâ€™ of the stateâ€™s finances. That the Shiv Sena leader should brandish the pen is a tad surprising for a party which believes in street-savvy politics and suicide squads. The Sena has of late been spearheading a series of â€˜raasta-rokosâ€™ in Mumbai to condemn the DF rule.

In a slim booklet released on Tuesday, Rane discusses the â€˜failuresâ€™ of the Vilasrao Deshmukh ministry which completed three years in office on October 18. Studded with straight facts, culled together by Rane, and crooked lines by noted caricaturist Vikas Sabnis, the Marathi booklet is a strongly-worded indictment of the ruling DF alliance which dismantled the Sena-BJP regime headed by Rane after the 1999 assembly elections.

â€œOver the last few days the state government has been assiduously marketing its â€˜gainsâ€™. But facts are contrary to the claims made by the CM and the deputy CM. The CM is actually misleading the people of the state. Maharashtraâ€™s financial condition is pitiable,â€™â€™ Mr Rane told journalists after the booklet was released by senior Sena MLA Dattaji Nalavade at the Senaâ€™s Nariman Point headquarters.

With revenue deficit reaching a staggering 109 per cent and a 12 per cent cut in capital expenditure, the state is groaning under astronomical financial burden. In its July 2002 report, ICRA, a leading rating agency, has brought down Maharashtra from LAA to LA, a poor third position.

Moreover, the IDBI, in a recent petition before the debt recovery tribunal, suggested that the co-operation departmentâ€™s office in Mantralaya be seized to recover Rs 550 crore from the state government as it failed to honour the loan guarantee to IDBI, Rane said.

â€œDistrict treasuries have been shut down and at least two state-controlled irrigation corporations have been declared defaulters. Even senior artistes have not been getting their measly monthly pensions as the state exchequer is empty,â€™â€™ he said.

â€œThe latest move to register a case against Sena chief Bal Thackeray for his outbursts is the state governmentâ€™s clever ploy to deflect the attention of the people from the grave problems that affect the state,â€™â€™ Rane said.

2,Most investment in iron & steel sector: Nirupam,"KOLKATA: Though Information Technology and agribusiness are new focal areas for industrialisation, investment trend revealed that good old heavy engineering sector, particularly, iron and steel industry attracted the actual financing more.

â€œMaximum investment came in iron and steel sector. Many units have come up in this sector. Nine steel projects, worth Rs 1,200 crore, would come up in 2003-04. These include Rs 128-crore Balaji Steel and Rs 32-crore Shamsel unit,â€™â€™ said industry minister Nirupam Sen. According to his department, investment worth Rs 6578.70 crore have come in the steel industry since 1991. Investments in IT software and telecom as well as food processing were Rs 325 crore and Rs 551 crore respectively. â€œProximity to coal and iron ore belt, changes in railways freight equilisation policy as well as cheap power made West Bengal more attractive for iron and steel industry.

The stateâ€™s heavy engineering base and skilled workforce offered additional advantage,â€� said an official. Even the troubled textile industry got investment worth Rs 1,199 crore out of total Rs 21,366 crore since 1991. Though growth rate and potentials in the field of IT service and IT enabled services are high, actual investment is still low as the Left went digital much later than others. In electronics and electrical sector, the amount was Rs 811.49 crore.

Mckinsey & Co, the state governmentâ€™s interlocutor with the global investors, claimed that investment from IT majors like GE, Unilever, Dakhs, Cognizant ICICI and Spectramind were in the â€˜pipelineâ€™. Already half a dozen call centres in ITES are operating in Kolkata. It asked the government to â€˜translate commitments â€™ from Wipro and others into investment.

â€œSince Bangalore has also become a city of frequent bandhs, the ITES investors want to expand their base here as part of their business continuity planning,â€�said an IT department official. But private investment in infrastruture is still poor, despite corporate pressure for quality roads and recreation. The investment in hotel and hospitals was only Rs 359.42 crore in the past 11 years. Sen was, however, hopeful that private investment this year might cross the amount of last year. Investment worth Rs 1,591 crore have come till August 31, while the amount was Rs 2,194 crore last year. Though meagre in comparison to Maharastra and Karnataka, foreign direct investment worth more than Rs 100 crore has come in 2002. Sen admitted that red tapism had to be curtailed.

The revised energy charges of such societies stand at Rs 1.80 for the first 50 units, Rs 2.50 for 50 to 300 units and Rs 3 for above Rs 300 units.

The late payment charge which was earlier fixed at 2 per cent has now been reduced to 1.5 per cent.

Spelling out the revised tariff schedule for the large and heavy power industries Bajaj said consumers opting for restricted hours supply would have to pay Rs 180 per kv against the earlier Rs 170.

Rate incentive has been offered to unmetered consumers to instal meters.

4,Govt to educate farmers on alternative crops,"HYDERABAD: Faced with an unprecedented drought in the state, the government has decided to discourage farmers from taking up paddy cultivation during the rabi season as it would be difficult to supply water. The decision was taken in the cabinet meeting on Wednesday where chief minister Chandrababu Naidu advised his colleagues to launch a campaign to educate farmers on the need to shift to alternative crops.

Accordingly, the government will take up a poster campaign to educate the farmers. Disclosing this to reporters, information minister S Chandramohan Reddy said that to encourage farmers to go in for alternative crops, the government was making arrangements for supply of Bengal gram and sunflower seeds for sowing in black cotton soils.

In addition, district collectors have been authorised to procure and supply suitable varieties of the seed under the contingency cropping programme. Stating that the recent rain has improved the fodder situation as well as the drinking water levels in some areas, he said the government, however, decided to send two fodder-laden trains, carrying around 500 metric tonnes each, to Anantapur district from East Godavari district. The trains will leave East Godavari on Friday.

The minister said that the government has received approval for another three lakh tonnes rice from the Centre under the Food-for-Work programme. The district-wise allocation of the rice has been fixed and it was decided to fix the rate of rice at a uniform Rs 8 per kg in all the districts. The minister was, however, evasive when asked whether the rice would be utilised for taking up new works or for completion of pending ones in the light of new guidelines which make it mandatory for using the rice for new works. â€œThe rice would be used for pending works wherever necessary but the emphasis would be on taking new works,â€� he said explaining that the use of machinery in the new works has been strictly banned.

5,Five riot refugees among dead,"HYDERABAD: They escaped from a carnage to fall prey to a deathtrap. Five of a 20-member group of Gujarat riot victims, who had taken refuge in the city, died and four others were injured in the fire that engulfed a building in Osmangunj on Wednesday.

Even as seven more fire victims remained unidentified, police officers say that some of them too could be the Gujarati Muslims. The dead were identified as Abbas Sheliya, Ashiq Ali Sheliya, Abid Ali, Mohd Ali, and Hasan Ali, all natives of Sidhapur taluq in Patan district of Gujarat. The Municipal Corporation of Hyderabad sent the bodies to Ahmedabad in a flight on Wednesday evening. A group of 70 persons had come to the city from Gujarat a fortnight ago.

They had lost their families and livelihood in their native state. They were invited to the city by their relations here who are organising largescale rehabilitation programmes. About 20 members this group was put up at the Karthikeya Lodge. They had been learning various trades and trying to set up businesses in the city, said Ibrahim Bhai, one of the organisers of the rehabilitation programme. â€œThey had lost everything. And still they were not spared,â€� said a sobbing Ibrahim of Langar Houz. According to Sarfaraz,who led rescue team that saved some of inmates of the lodge, the Gujaratis who were staying in the lodge were skilled jewellers. Sarafaraz lives next to the building which caught fire.

â€œI used to meet these people everyday. They told me that they hailed from Patan in Gujarat and that they were jewellers by trade.â€� Many of the inmates would help the lodge management with some odd jobs too, he added. All the four members of the group who were injured were put on oxygen cylinders and they are not out of danger, doctors at the Osmania General Hospital said.

6,Political parties protest Sevnan killings,"PATNA: Different parties held demonstrations and staged dharnas on Wednesday in protest against the killing of three innocent people at Sevnan in Jehanabad a few days back.

The parties have demanded compensation of Rs 5 lakh to each of the deceasedâ€™s family and a government job to the next kin of the deceased.

The Patna Mahanagar Yuva Lok Janshakti (PMYLJ) staged a dharna at the Income-Tax roundabout. PMYLJ president Santosh Kumar Goutam strongly criticised the RJD government for playing caste politics.

He said when three Yadavs were killed in Nagoli, RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav immediately announced Rs 50,000 to each of the deceased family, but when three Rajputs were killed in Sevnan nothing was done for their families.

Besides, the party has demanded the convening of an urgent meeting by the state government with regard to the closure of Barauni and Sindri factories.

Goutam warned that if the state government did not take action in this connection by October 31, the party will be forced take strong measures. The party threatened to launch a â€œrail chakka jamâ€� agitation in Bihar and as well as in Jharkhand.

The Jan Kalyan Kshtriya Manch staged a â€œsamoohik upvas-dharnaâ€� at the Income-Tax roundabout. The party submitted a five-point charter of demands to governor Vinod Chandra Pande, which includes arrest of culprits immediately, Rs 5 lakh compensation, government job to a member of the deceasedâ€™s family, measures to curb killings and Army rule in Jehanabad district.

Manch president Jitendra Neeraj said if the government does not take any action by the end of this month, the party will gherao chief minister Rabri Devi in the first week of November.

The Yuva Janata Dal (secular) â€œchakka jamâ€� at the Dak Bungalow roundabout created problems for the people. According to the press release, a large number of protesters were arrested by the police and the traffic remained at a standstill for many hours.

Partyâ€™s national president Jainendra Kumar also criticised the state government for discriminating against the people killed at Sevnan. Kumar said the government was helping the victims of carnage on the basis of caste and creed, which is highly condemnable. He demanded Rs 10 lakh compensation and job to a member of the deceasedâ€™s family.

9,"Cong, Bajrang Dal workers clash in Nagpur","NAGPUR: Workers of the Congress and Bajrang Dal clashed at Sonegaon airport here on Thursday as VHP leader Pravin Togadia arrived on a two-day tour of the region.

Police said the activists of Congress and Youth Congress, who were staging a demonstration outside the airport building to protest the derogatory remarks by Togadia against the party president Sonia Gandhi, tried to reach the VHP leader when he came out of the building and were obstructed by the activists of Bajrang Dal.

10,Disinvestment pannel 51 pc stake sale in IRCON,"NEW DELHI: Disinvestment Commission has forwarded yet another report to the government recommending sale of 51 per cent stake in railway construction company, IRCON along with management control.

The revamped commission in its fourteenth and latest report submitted to the government recently has said that majority stake should be offered to strategic partner along with management control through competitive bidding route.

The report also argues that government should continue to hold 26 per cent stake in the company.

""Government should undertake phased dilution of equity having ensured government stake does not fall below 26 per cent for at least 3-5 years"", it said.

In order to retain employees the commission recommended an incentivization scheme like Employee Stock Option Scheme.

Government currently owns 99.73 per cent stake in the company which has a paid up capital of Rs 4.95 crore and a employee strength of 1808.

It recommended that company should pay back substantial portion of free cash and marketable securities prior to disinvestment including a special dividend to return free cash.

The commission asserts that IRCONs continued association with its parent, Ministry of Railways, would prove to be a value enhancer as well as suitable incentive to support its development activities in the interim period before complete disinvestment.

12,Cong willing to support SP to topple UP govt,"MUMBAI: The Congress on Thursday said that it was willing to extend support to the Samajwadi Party to bring down the Mayawati-led BJP-BSP government in Uttar Pradesh.

""If Mayawati government in UP can be toppled with the help of Congress, then we will extend support to Samajwadi Party,"" senior Congress leader Ramniwas Mirdha told a press conference here.

Mirdha''s statement assumes significance in the wake of dissidence in the BJP unit of Uttar Pradesh and reported efforts by Mulayam Singh to bring down the coalition government there.

Mirdha, who is also the member of the manifesto implementtion committee for Maharashtra, sought to play down reported differences between the party and the Congress-led DF government.

""The Congress believes in pluralistic ideology and does not suppress its leaders from expressing their viewpoints,"" Mirdha said.

The senior Congress leader, who also heads the party''s central election authority, gave a pat to the MPCC chief Govindrao Adik and the chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh.

He blamed the policies of the erswhile Shiv Sena-BJP government and the NDA government for ""financial difficulties"" of the state.

13,Will Salman's brush with the law affect his popularity?,"MUMBAI: Salman''s family, friends and fans are finally breathing easy. The actor has been granted bail by Judge P V Bavkar on Thursday, after a strict warning not to contact witnesses in the case. Although those close to Salman believe that the worst of times are over, there is a nagging thought that sets one thinking about Salman''s future career graph.

Although actors like Sunjay Dutt and Fardeen Khan have been able to put their skirmishes with the law behind them and take their careers forward, one wonders whether Salman will be able to do the same. After a harrowing period in jail, it will certainly be tough for the actor to swing into action on the sets immediately. Are his producers willing to wait for him?

We spoke to well-known trade analyst, Komal Nahata, about Salman''s current position in the industry. Although he has only three to four films on hand right now -- Dil Chura Ke Chal Diye and Tere Naam being two of them, as well as the Hollywood project Marigold , would the accident case affect Salman''s star status in the industry?

Komal says, ""There must be roughly around Rs 35-40 crore riding on Salman Khan right now. He''s doing two or three films at the moment. But I don''t think this incident will affect his career prospects in any way. See, in the film industry, it is the current box-office standing of the star that matters. The question is only whether the actor will be able to pull in crowds at theatres, and I believe Salman can still do this.""

What about the film Marigold which is to be made by a Hollywood company? The film, a musical romantic comedy to be directed by Willard Carrol, had been announced with much fanfare and is budgeted at under $10 million. It is expected to star an as yet uncast US actress and will be shot in both Hindi and English. Considering that attitudes abroad are quite different, would Salman''s involvement in the accident case result in his being dropped from the project? ""Actually, I don''t know about Marigold . Whatever has happened so far is merely on paper, and they''ve only held press conferences and such. The film hasn''t gone on the floors as yet, and I am skeptical about when it will begin. So it doesn''t matter right now.""

His Indian producers may have stuck by him so far, but the corporate world hasn''t been so kind to Salman. In fact, Thums Up has already switched loyalties to Akshay Kumar, to ensure that the incident doesn''t affect the product''s standing in the market.

Although Coca-Cola India itself has refused to state why it has opted for Akshay Kumar, a spokesperson for the company merely stated, ""Our contract with Salman expires in two months,"" and there was apparently no intention of renewing the said contract. Will Salman be able to endorse products again? ""The ad world functions in a totally different way as compared to the film industry,"" Komal reveals, ""I am not familiar with their machinations, so I won''t be able to comment on why. Thums Up may have opted for Akshay Kumar, but we''ll just have to just wait and watch how they will react.""

The actor is out on bail, but could there be another arrest in the near future post the court verdict (assuming it, God forbid, didn''t go in his favour). Would that put a spoke in the wheel for producers again? ""No, I don''t think so,"" says Komal. ""The legal process is already underway, but I don''t see Salman being arrested again in the near future.""

We''re sure everyone has their fingers crossed on that one. Especially Salman''s producers! As for where his stock is going, time will tell.",MUMBAI
14,"2,747 villages declared drought-hit by govt","GANDHINAGAR: In view of the inadequate rainfall received in some pockets of Saurashtra and North Gujarat, the state government has announced drought conditions in as many as 2747 villages of Kutch, Jamnagar, Banaskantha and Dahod districts where relief works will start by the first week of November.

State revenue minister Nitin Patel told media persons that a decision to this effect was taken at the cabinet meeting held here.

He said that the cattle-breeders would be provided fodder at Rs 1 per kg in the drought-affected areas.

The minister said that the state government has already taken a series of measures to deal with the drinking water problem in these villages. At present, there is no shortage of drinking water.

The government will on receipt of detailed reports from district collectors start disbursement of cash and other assistance including distribution of foodgrains to the people living in the scarcity-hit areas.

The collectors have been directed to take all necesary action according to the guidelines in the relief manual.

He said that if the need arose, the government would include more villages in the list of the drought-affected districts.

The government would also approach the central government and seek more financial assistance from the central calamity fund to meet the expenses to be incurred on relief works in the affected areas.

15,British to help train hospital staff in riot victims’ handling,"AHMEDABAD: The Association of British Scholars (ABS), Gujarat chapter, an umbrella organisation for ABS Indiaâ€™s 12 regional chapters, and the British Library have planned a two-day workshop on disaster preparedness for hospitals in the city on October 29 and 30.

Earlier ABS had focused on training hospital staff to respond to emergency situations occurring due to natural disasters like earthquakes. However, for this workshop it has shifted its focus and HAS decided to train para-medical staff about how to handle victims of riot and terrorist attacks.

ABSâ€™s president Dr Gunvant Patel says, â€œWe have planned this event to help our hospitals to respond to man-made disasters like the recent riots and terrorist attacks, when hospitals in the city were flooded with victims of these unfortunate events.â€�

Dr Manjul Joshipura, ABS Gujaratâ€™s vice-president and National Disaster Preparedness Course for Hospitals (NDPCH) co-ordinator, says that in January this year ABS had an event focusing on natural disasters because Gujarat had faced natural disasters like floods and earthquake. â€œThis year we have decided to train the hospital staff in treating victims of man-made disasters because we observed that physicians and para-medical staff in Gujarat need training to cope with such incidents,â€� he adds.

The NDPCH workshop will teach the hospital staff new techniques in how to handle casualties in an emergency created by a man-made disaster. â€œSurvival rate of victims of these unfortunate events depends upon the ability of hospitals and health facilities to handle casualties. To prepare our hospitals and train our para-medical staff is the dire need of the hour,â€� says Patel.

This course is designed to respond to the needs of city hospitals and also addresses organisational and medical concerns of health facilities. â€œIt inspects the ability of these institutions to respond effectively to disasters and how this ability can be enhanced. The preparedness of hospitals to undertake mass-treatment is the focus of this workshop,â€� adds Joshipura.

Colonel Timothy Hodgetts of the Royal British Army, who is globally known as a leader in emergency medicines and disaster medicine, will conduct interactive lectures, case studies and practical exercises. The NDPCH workshop will also be held in Bangalore on November 2 and 3.

17,Desecration triggers clash in Bhatkal,"KARWAR: Prohibitory orders were clamped on Bhatkal town under Section 144 of the CrPC from 11 am on Thursday, after three persons were injured in violence. Two KSRTC buses and three police jeeps were damaged during the Bhatkal bandh called by the BJP.

Normal life came to a standstill and incidents of stone-throwing and arson were reported.

DC Rakesh Singh and SP Ramesh Hariharan are camping in the town. Singh said the ban orders would be in force till Sunday night. Schools and colleges will remain closed on Friday and Saturday. Shops and business establishments have been directed to down shutters after 5 pm.

Communal tension erupted after some miscreants desecrated the Kali Hanuman temple near Bhatkal Town Municipal office, close on the heels of the Udupi Pejawar seer Vishveshwarathirtha Swamji visiting mosques and participating in an all-religion conference to promote communal harmony. On October 17, some miscreants had thrown faeces on the front door of the Kali Hanuman temple. The police had intervened on time, and held peace community meetings involving leaders of both communities. Peace was restored.

However, the miscreants who had not been apprehended by the police desecrated another temple near the Hanuman temple by throwing human excreta on the door on Wednesday. This led to another peace committee meeting and peace march which included Bhatkal MLA J.D. Naik, former MLA and BJP district president Shivanand Naik, Tanzin president D.H. Shabbir, TMC president Parvez Kasimji, Manjappa Naik, DC Rakesh Singh and others.

However, the Hindu Jagrana Vedike boycotted the peace committee meeting, saying it would not attend such meetings till the miscreants were arrested. The HJV and BJP gave a call for a Bhatkal bandh.

Security had been beefed up in the town and peace is being maintained. Five platoons of the KSRP, nine platoons of the DAR and two DySPs from other districts are also in Bhatkal, Singh said.

The town had been hit by a prolonged communal riot in 1993 when many persons had lost their lives.
