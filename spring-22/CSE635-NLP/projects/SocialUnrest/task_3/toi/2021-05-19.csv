0,Fate of disinvestment ministry uncertain,"NEW DELHI: As the Congress and its allies wrestle with challenge of government formation, fate of disinvestment ministry seems uncertain amid indications that Congress could consider do away with it to mollify Left.

Though firm on carrying on with divestment in PSUs in accordance with the roadmap laid down by the party manifesto, the Congress leadership seems to be veering round to the view that axing the ministry and assigning its responsibility to a wing within the finance ministry might be worth it if it helps secure better co-ordination with the Left.

""The disinvestment programme can be handled by the finance ministry and there is no need for an department exclusively for the job,"" a Congress source said.

The calculation is that the scrapping of the department of disinvestment will also help fend off Left''s demand for a probe into the disinvestment decisions.

The Left has been pressing for a commission of inquiry to look into the matter. Congress, however, is disinclined to accept the demand as it wants to move ahead and avoid the impression of a witch-hunt.

Congress feels that a public concession in form of dismantling the ministry will make it easier for Left to allow disinvestment continue apace, even if under a different tag in a modified form.

But it is bracing for a conflict of opinion with Left on matter of food security.

While Congress sees the current PDS as ineffective and would like to switch to an alternative which is selective and caters to only the genuinely needy, Left has campaigned for the scheme to be extended to cover all sections.

1,Beer to cost more as govt hikes duty,"PATNA: The state Cabinet on Tuesday decided to revise excise duty on beer, approve New Excise Policy and amend Bihar Tenancy Act. Cabinet secretary Vijay Prakash said the monsoon session of assembly would begin from June 4 and remain in effect till June 26, 2004. There would be 16 working days of the assembly during the session.

The cabinet has given its nod to the New Excise Policy under which, among other things, there is a provision of collective settlement of country, spiced and foreign liquors. The new provision would fetch an additional revenue of Rs 98 crore for the state exchequer.

Prakash said the excise duty on beer has been revised. Beer has been made further costlier and the hiked duty is likely to add Rs 7.46 crore annually to the state''s coffers. The price of normal beer has been increased by Rs eight to Rs 20 per bulk litre while the strong beer would be costlier by Rs 12 to Rs 25 per bulk litre. Super strong beer would be costlier by Rs 15 to Rs 25 per bulk litre.

The cabinet dismissed Khagaria additional district judge Ram Gopal Pandey from the service on the recommendation of the Patna High Court. It has also dismissed a medical officer, Dr Ashok Kumar Pandey, from service on the charge of remaining on unauthorised leave for 241 days. He was posted at the Primary Health Centre in Semrao village of Bhojpur district.

The cabinet scrapped Rule 27(1) of the Bihar Cinematography Regulation Rules, 1974, by which the state government was the regulatory authority for admission rates in cinema halls.

Now the licensing authority, that is, the respective DMs, would regulate the admission rates. The Patna HC had earlier given a ruling empowering the DMs to decide admission rates.

The cabinet has also okayed the Bihar Tenancy (amendment) Act. Besides, it released a sum of Rs one crore for the construction of nine-km road on the right embankment of Burhi Gandak, Prakash said, adding the Cabinet has also sanctioned Rs 1.11 crore for payment of pension benefits to the employees of Bihar State Khadi Gramodyog Commission.

2,Happy tidings for distressed farmers,"HYDERABAD: Days after inking the freepower-to-tillers file, Y S Rajasekhara Reddy on Tuesday took another step to pull farmers out of misery when he announced a special package for them.

In doing so, he didn''t forget the IT sector and assured it that there would be no major deviation from the line being followed now. Seeking to put at rest all misgivings in the sector, he said his aim was to build a robust IT sector.

With these clear directives the mist has now lifted over the new government''s answer to challenges posed by the beleaguered farming community and the jittery IT sector.

Addressing his primary constituency, Reddy unfolded an elaborate policy to take care of tillers in distress. The government, he said, would help farmers clear debts of up to Rs 50,000 and initiate measures to draw them out of gloom.

Pitching his appeal at families of farmers who committed suicides, he said his administration would get their kin admitted to social welfare schools and they would get houses and other benefits. He would bring a legislation to fix a ceiling on interest rates on loans given by money lenders.

Reddy also announced the constitution of verification and certification committees, comprising revenue divisional officers, deputy superintendents of police, local legislators and sarpanches.

Their task will be to look into cases of farmers'' suicides since July 1, 1998. These committees will examine reasons that drove farmers to suicide and, in genuine cases, liquidate debts up to Rs 50,000.

Village elders will talk to money lenders, banks and co-op societies and clear dues under a one-time settlement arrangement. He hoped that the lenders would take a humane approach and cooperate with the government.

The government will deposit Rs 1 lakh in a joint account in the name of the mandal revenue officer (MRO) and the victims'' kin. The MRO and the agriculture officer will guide these families. Efforts will also be made to buy land for the landless.

Every district headquarters will have farmers'' helplines to enable farmers seek help in emergencies. The RDOs must answer these calls and help out the callers. He clarified that his government won''t bring the Debt Relief Act, for it would destroy the rural credit structure.

This Act was introduced by Indira Gandhi in 1977 and scratched out all debts contracted by farmers.

Providing a further fillip to the agrarian sector, he announced the mobilisation of Rs 46,000 crore in the next five years to complete 28 pending irrigation projects. Much of this will be through external borrowings.

3,'Harassed' power consumer dies of cardiac arrest,"HYDERABAD: A consumer, who was reportedly threatened by CPDCL vigilance officials that a penalty of Rs 1 lakh will be slapped for pilfering power, suffered a heart attack and died on Tuesday.

Mohammed Mansoor (48), a resident of Punjagutta market, who was told to pay up the amount, suffered a mild stroke on Monday and was rushed to a private hospital.

But hours later, he suffered a cardiac arrest and died on Tuesday morning. Mansoor''s relatives alleged that CPDCL officials had been harassing him since April 27 after a team found that his meter was not functioning and that he would have to cough up Rs 1 lakh as penalty.

""They suggested to him that the fine could be reduced to Rs 40,000 if Rs 10,000 was paid as bribe,"" Mansoor''s brother, Mohammed Masood, told reporters.

Mansoor was shocked when he checked with the local office that the actual arrears was only Rs 12,544 and informed the same to the Vigilance officials. But, the officials insisted he pay.

""The officials were literally threatening my brother. They warned him that his power connection would be disconnected if he failed to clear the amount,"" he said. Since then, Mansoor was disturbed and complained of chest pain on Monday.

4,Venkaiah in party's bad books,"NEW DELHI: Devastated and in disarray after the elections, BJP was in search of an issue. On the ""foreign origin"" issue, the party thought it had found a vehicle for its narrow Hindutva nationalist line. It had even asked its state units to protest at respective headquarters if Sonia was sworn in as PM.

With Sonia making it clear that she wasn''t going to take up the job, BJP''s campaign against foreign origin is over before it could take off.

Party sources said, ""We will now have to wait for the new government to make mistakes on economic reforms to attack them. I guess we need to give the new government an opportunity to begin ruling.""

Sonia''s action has also stymied the race for the party presidency. Stressing that a change in leadership would not take place immediately, party sources said it was an issue uppermost in partymen''s minds with resentment building up against Venkaiah Naidu.

""Sushma Swaraj, by announcing she would tonsure her head and wear white, and Uma Bharati by sending her resignation as CM to â€” incidentally, Naidu, and not the MP governor â€” were both simply laying the ground for the top job in the party. Govindacharya, by launching the RSS-sponsored Rashtriya Swabhiman campaign, was hoping to return to the party. Now all of them have been deprived of an issue,"" a party leader said.

Sullen over the defeat, the party has refused to acknowledge its failure to admit that its pre-poll assessments were fundamentally flawed.

In an election in which every BJP leader took potshots at Sonia''s foreign origin, and constantly posed the choice ""Atal Bihari Vajpayee versus Sonia Gandhi"", the electorate gave more seats to Congress than BJP.

The party also fights shy of admitting that its campaign against ""foreign origin"" has failed to isolate Sonia.

At the end of an election which she seemed at times to be fighting singlehandedly, Sonia had the signed and sealed support of more than 300 MPs, with all, barring the Samajwadi Party, endorsing her leadership.

The same stubbornness is behind its failure to recognise that Sonia''s action in turning down the prime ministership was fraught with the possibility of enhancing her stature in a country where people set great store by ""self-sacrifice"".

Indeed, the NDA which met on Tuesday evening appeared to be on retreat, with its convener George Fernandes announcing that if someone other than Sonia became PM, BJP and NDA leaders would attend the swearing-in ceremony.

7,SP not to join Cong-led government,"NEW DELHI: Samajwadi Party on Wednesday announced that it would not join the Congress-led government at the Centre but extend outside support like the Left parties.

""It is the decision of our Parliamentary board to follow Left parties. As CPI-M is not joining the government, we are also not joining it,"" SP General Secretary Amar Singh told reporters here.

He said that he met CPI-M General Secretary Harkishen Singh Surjeet on Wednesday morning and told him the SP would follow CPM in not joining the government but extend outside support.

8,Left parties give letters of support to Cong-led govt,"NEW DELHI: All the four Left parties on Wednesday gave letters of support for a Congress-led government at the Centre, as Congress President Sonia Gandhi held a meeting with CPI(M) General Secretary Harkishen Singh Surjeet to seek their approval for the candidature of Manmohan Singh for prime ministership.

Fresh letters were required as those given earlier by the CPI, CPI(M) and Forward Bloc had become infructuous since they spoke of giving support to a Sonia Gandhi-led government, a possibility now ruled out with the Congress president turning down the proposal.

While letters, addressed to the President and carrying the list of MPs each party had, were given to the Congress, the RSP leaders gave their letter to President A P J Abdul Kalam straight, Left sources said.

9,I'm very much in politics: Sonia,"NEW DELHI: Rejecting fresh appeals by top Congress leaders to change her mind, party President Sonia Gandhi on Wednesday asked Congressmen to understand the ""depth"" of her sentiment behind refusal of prime ministership but made it clear she was ""still very much in politics"".

In her one-and-a-half page statement, Sonia also appealed to the partymen to support the new Congress prime minister.

""I urge you to support the Congress prime minister. And I request you to give your full support to the new cabinet. The Congress party is overflowing with talent. Let us give India the government it deserves.""

Sonia said she was overwhelmed by the love of Congressmen and added ""but now we must get on with the serious business of undoing the damage done by the last government and of working to create the India of our dreams.""

""I understand your disappointment. But I appeal to you to understand the depth of my sentiment when I say that I cannot reverse my decision.

""We live in times when politics is about power. Let us show the world that for the Congress party, politics is about values and integrity,"" she said.

Speaking for herself, Sonia said ""I will always be here, working for the party. The Congress is my life. All of you are my family. Let us now build the 21st century India that was Rajivji''s vision"".

She assured those who were upset or disappointed by the decision that she was not going anywhere. ""I am still very much in politics. I will continue as Congress President and Chairperson, Congress Party in Parliament for as long as you want me to. I am one of you and nothing will ever change that.""

Sonia said she ""entered politics out of a sense of duty and commitment and her family had always treated politics as part of a crusade to create a better India"".

""Indiraji and Rajivji made the supreme sacrifice for our nation. Their examples inspired us all and....I know that I derive my strength from their courage.""

Declaring that no matter how much adversity she has faced, Gandhi said it was nothing compared to what they had to go through. ""Today it is their strength and their inspiration that guide me and the Congress party"".

10,Bihar Council welcomes RBI credit policy,"PATNA: The chairman of Bihar Council of Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) Pramod Sharma while welcoming RBI''s annual policy statement, said that it focussed on credit delivery in the key areas of agriculture, small and medium enterprises and infrastructure.

Sharma, in a statement issued here on Wednesday, said that the Econonomic Outlook for 2004-05 presented by RBI was very much in line with what the CII expected.

These are the areas which the CII has been been highlighting in all its interaction with the government, he said.

The CII leader said that while GDP growth was expected to continue to be robust, there could be some concerns on inflation due to rising oil prices as well as excessive domestic liquidity.

Sharma, however, said that the RBI governor had shown wisdom in maintaining the current interest rate enviromment arguing that the price situation was unlikely to cause concern to macro-economic stability.

Sharma said that while the inclusion of loans for building storage facilities for agriculture products was a welcome development, the alignment of repayment dates for agricultural loans to harvesting dates was an innovative measure and CII hoped that it would succeed in reducing non-performing assets (NPAs) in this sector.

The chairman of Bihar Council of CII said that CII believed that it was very important to increase the flow of credit to small and medium enterprises. One of the inhibiting factors has been the lack of widely available information on their credit worthiness, Sharma said. He said that the suggestion to work out a mechanism for sharing credit records through the Credit Information Bureau of India must speedily taken forward.

Sharma said that the CII was keenly awaiting the other recommendations of the Working Group on flow of credit to the small scale industries (SSI) sector.

With regard to infrastructure sector, Sharma said that RBI annual policy had taken two important steps. He said that it had widened the definition of infrastructure lending to include projects such as construction of agriculture related units, educational institutions and hospitals while banks had been allowed to raise long-term bonds for infrastructure.

Sharma said that CII believed that this monetary policy would set the stage for policy announcements to be made by the new government at the centre.

11,Post-poll wave smothers political smiles,"NEW DELHI: For fallen leaders keeping up a political smile has become a painful proposition.

The most prominent among them is AIADMK''s Ammaji. Such was her urge to salvage lost pride that almost in four days after her historic drubbing in the ballot battleground, she decided to roll back to government employees all rights and liberties she had swiped off on a clean administrative sweep, having been bucked up by the Great NDA Cleansing of the society.

The government employees of Tamil Nadu are today having their last laugh, as Jayalalithaa on Tuesday ordered reinstatement of 1,000 teachers, with payment of their back wages and restoration of their right to strike. Before mediapersons she wore a wry smile, for a change. In the hustings for the 14th Lok Sabha, her AIADMK drew a blank. She has to play cautious now, as the mandate was almost a revolution against her.

Soon followed Trinamul Congress'' Didi, known for her ability to make controversial news on issues she thought most dear to all, but were seen mere vote-bank stunts. Blandly she expressed in Kolkata on Monday that tying up with NDA proved costly for All India Trinamul Congress (AITC).

Firebrand Didi has now sobered after the polls. No longer she believes CPM is actually doing a misrule in West Bengal, nor harbours a dream of raiding the Writers'' Buildings ever in life. AITC fared a little better than Amma''s AIADMK, retained, as it did, two seats in entire West Bengal, losing the five other it had before the hustings.

The third NDA ally which is strongly ruing its distance from power is the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) chief Omprakash Chautala of Haryana. On Tuesday at a meeting he said his decision to join the NDA was absolutely suicidal. Like Amma, Chautala''s INLD also drew a big Zero in the recent hustings for the 14th Lok Sabha.

Chautala''s drubbing was just waiting to happen. Perfect weathercocks, INLD partymen are seriously devoid of any sound ideology other than the mindset to change loyalty overnight. All they always looked for was whether the other prosperous side was ready to accommodate them.

The culture is well-set in Haryana Congress as the 1980 instance of Bhajan Lal switching over loyalty from Janata Party to Congress overnight within 24 hours to stay in power, is still not forgotten. That was a formative year in post-Emergency Indian politics, when the first non-Congress government, of Janata Dal, fell to Indira Gandhi''s popular moves.

Former Lok Sabha Speaker PA Sangma''s smile has woefully faded after this hustings. Thouugh Meghalaya''s Tura continued to trust him, Sangma has now to travel, for everything he wants for Tura, a long road of rapprochement with the new Congress government that''d be run by Sonia through an RC. Sangma used to exude whiffs of new ideas in Indian politics.

Falling out within the Congress on Sonia''s foreign origin issue and, thereafter, splitting up for an NCP though was his first blemish, he was managing it very well, thanks to his fresh-air smiles.

But Sharad Pawar''s turn to sail with the wind achored Sangma woefully. Worst for him was still to come, when he tied up with Mamata''s AITC - a party that was seriously wanting in electoral ideology and, therefore, strategy - which was destined to lose.

12,Butail assails Himachal BJP chief's remarks on polls,"SHIMLA: Revenue minister B B Butail on Wednesday ridiculed the statement of BJP state chief Suresh Bharadwaj that the result of the recently held Lok Sabha elections indicated resentment of the people against chief minister Virbhadra Singh, adding that it merely showed the frustration of the BJP leaders at the humiliating defeat the party had suffered.

He said that the massive mandate given to the Congress in the Lok Sabha elections, clearly showed that the people of the state had full faith in the chief minister and the programmes and policies being pursued by his government, as Virbhadra had ensured the welfare of all sections of society.

The minister said that the Congress won three seats and lost one by a very narrow margin, which showed that the people had rejected the BJP in the state, which the party leaders should accept. ""Even the vote percentage had increased from 41 per cent to 51 per cent, the credit of which goes to the performance of the state government during the last one year"", he added.

He said that the mandate given to the Congress by the people indicated that they had realised that only the Congress can ensure overall development and give the right direction, as experience of the NDA government in the Centre and previous BJP government in Himachal Pradesh were rather bad, with these government having failed to deliver the goods.

13,How Sardarji caught political bus,"NEW DELHI: The turning point in Manmohan Singh''s life came on a hot summer day 13 years ago â€” in the second week of June 1991. The Chandrashekhar regime, in which Singh was the PM''s economic adviser, had gone, and Singh himself was pigeon-holed in the University Grants Commission as chairman.This, after being in the thick of government as chief economic adviser, economic affairs secretary, deputy chairman of Planning Commission and RBI governor. People were, in fact, talking about the Sardar fading into the twilight. And then came a phone call from an unlikely person, PV Narasimha Rao, who had just taken charge of the Congress and was poised to take over as PM.Rao was looking for a craftsman who could usher in economic liberalisation and reforms. And he had been advised by Indira Gandhi''s principal secretary PC Alexander on two choices, IG Patel and Manmohan Singh.Patel declined the offer and Rao rang up Manmohan Singh. Singh was surprised and asked Rao why he wanted him. For two reasons, said Rao. One, Singh had the capability to reform the economy and, two, Rao had had enough of politics and was now looking to go down in history as the man who transformed the country''s economy.Singh listened and said he, in turn, would seek two assurances. One, Rao''s unstinted support to all his measures, and two, he wouldn''t be made a sacrificial lamb for the unpopular decisions he needed to take. Rao gave his word and, to his credit, kept it through thick and thin.Singh was in office in no time. In fact, he was one minister who was already on the job even before portfolios were formally distributed. And before presenting his budget on July 19, he had already taken four stunning decisions: he depreciated the rupee by 18 per cent, scrapped export subsidy, delicensed all but 18 industries, and opened up all but eight sectors to the private sector.In his budget, Singh announced partial convertibility of the rupee and slashed import duty. A new economic era had arrived; India was transiting from a state-controlled to a market economy. The jargon too was different: In his first press conference, Singh came up with the memorable line, ""There are no free lunches."" In fact, the man was changing â€” the socialist had turned into a die-hard reformer.Of course, it was not a smooth ride. In fact, things got so rough that Singh resigned twice. One resignation was publicised, one wasn''t.The first time he put in his papers was in 1991 itself. Fertiliser prices had been hiked and there was an outcry. After a long meeting, Rao sent word through his principal secretary AN Verma to Singh: the hike would have to be rolled back partially. Instead, Singh sent in his resignation. Rao is understood to have dissuaded him, explaining that this was statecraft. Things rarely moved in a straight line. In any case, a partial rollback was a partial hike. Singh took the point and withdrew his resignation. This story remains, by and large, untold.The second time he threatened to quit became a big media story. The JPC draft report on the Harshad Mehta scam had been leaked and it spoke about indicting Singh for ""sleeping"" through the scam. Singh put in his papers, left office and stayed at home until his alleged culpability had been diluted in the report and Rao gave him a clean chit in Parliament.Even before the JPC outcry, Manmohan was showing unmistakable signs of learning politics. When asked what would be his first task as FM, Singh said to bring back the gold mortgaged to Swiss and English banks by the Chandra Shekhar government to tide over a precarious payments crisis. The pink papers had then attacked this ""useless enterprise"" but Singh recognised the importance of bringing back the gold for popular reasons.At the same time, he was open to taking decisions that wouldn''t pass a strict morality test. Like his forex immunity scheme under which you could bring in money stashed away abroad, no questions asked. He was roundly criticised but Singh was pragmatic enough to see the money brought back would only bolster the economy.Like every leader, Singh also had his favourites â€” the trusted ones, if you like. Montek Singh Ahluwalia was one of them; he soon became finance secretary. Both NK Singh and the present RBI governor YV Reddy were joint secretaries in his team.For having two Singhs as his key men, Montek and NK, Manmohan Singh earned a sobriquet for his team â€” it was called the Singh Parivar.",NEW DELHI
