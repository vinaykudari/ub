0,Jharia residents resent minister's remark on evacuees,"DHANBAD: The Jharia Coalfield Bachao Samiti (JCBS) has strongly reacted to the statement of Union minister of state for coal Ravi Shankar Prasad on the issue of evacuation of Jharia residents. At a meeting of JCBS, the officials criticised the ministerâ€™s assertion made during his one-day visit to Jharia coalfield recently.

Prasad had made it clear that peripheral areas of Jharia town must be vacated in view of mine fire and land subsidence danger. He had also urged the trade unions and political party leaders not to make it an issue in the greater interest of those living in danger areas.

The meeting felt the ministerâ€™s statement showed that the government had prepared phasewise evacuation of Jharia. His statement also aimed at creating confusion on this vexed issue and tide down the protest of the people.The JCBS, a political peopleâ€™s outfit, has cautioned the Jharia residents of such statement, which was a part of conspiracy of government and the Bharat Central Coalfields Limited (BCCL) management.

The JCBS categorically appealed to Jharia people not to go by the ministerâ€™s statement of remained unite as in the past for further struggle.

The meeting was of the opinion that the government had hatched a conspiracy to create such condition, by vacating peripheral areas of the town, which would compel residents to vacate the town on their own. The JCBS has also accused the government of creating panic among the people by asserting that evacuation is essential. But there was no effort of remedial measures, it lamented.

The JCBS is fighting the battle against evacuation at court and on the streets. A PIL has been filed in the Jharkhand high court on the issue besides spearheading an agitation. The JCBS, under the leadership of Jharkhand science and technology minister Samresh Singh, represented to the president Dr Abdul Kalam urging him to save the historical coal town.

The President then asked the coal minister Uma Bharati for fresh review of evacuation plan.

The Presidential direction restricted the Union coal ministry to push its evacuation plan. The ministry had to constitute an expert panel to look into the issue and decided to undertake fresh survey of people living in the danger areas. The survey is yet to be initiated.

The BCCL, in its earlier survey, identified 5,200 families living at several danger areas in the periphery of the Jharia town.

Interestingly, the government has no concrete rehabilitation plan so far for those identified families. Even the BCCL employees, who are to be evacuated, are not ready to shift to new place, Kamatar, where a colony has been raised by the BCCL, in absence of infrastructural facilities and isolated location.

While Adoor made it clear that he was not prepared to work as an ""obedient agent"" by compromising on functional freedom, Karthikeyan asserted that the government was duty-bound to retain its control over appointments and finances of the Akademi.

Adoor, who handed over his resignation to Chief Minister A K Antony, said ""I was there at the Akademi for a cause. I am quitting it now that I am convinced that I cannot act on my own.""

""I don''t want to work as an agent. They (government) need an obedient chairman. I am afraid I am a bit disobedient,"" said Adoor.

In a strong rebuttal of Adoor''s allegations, Karthikeyan told a press meet that he was ""shocked to learn that such a reputed artiste had a petty mind"".

He alleged that Adoor was not even ready to recognise the talents of other artistes.

Karthikeyan also denied that his department had interfered in the day-to-day functioning or academic matters of the Institution.

5,Mufti govt failed to provide security: BJP,"JAMMU: The Bhartiya Janta Party on Wednesday charged the PDP-led coalition government in Jammu and Kashmir with having failed to provide security to people and restore normalcy in Jammu division and expressed apprehension that militants active in the state would make use of the current regime''s ""healing touch"" policy to their own advantage.

The situation in the Jammu division, especially in Muslim majority districts of Rajouri and Poonch, was never as ""dangerous and awful as it has been since November 2, 2002, when protagonists of ""healing touch"", with the full backing of AICC chief Sonia Gandhi"", formed government in the state, Pradesh BJP spokesman Hari Om said in a statement here.

He said it was the firm belief of the BJP that Pakistan-sponsored terrorists would take full advantage of this policy of ""healing touch"" and unleash a reign of terror all over the state to further their agenda and harass the pro-India and liberal minded elements in Jammu and Kashmir.

The BJP spokesman said the validity of the party''s apprehensions was evident ""from the manner in which the terrorists have started perpetrating after November 2 all sorts of barbarities on the civil society with a view to Talibanising the otherwise forward-looking and progressive Muslim society in the border areas"" and creating an atmosphere in which all non-Muslims start considering it unsafe to stay in Rajouri and Poonch districts.
