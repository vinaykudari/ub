0,Four cases of suicide in city,"AHMEDABAD: Four people committed suicide on New Yearâ€™s day in the city. In the first incident, Dinesh Ishwarbhai, 21, hanged himself with a â€˜dupattaâ€™ at his residence in Gomtipur. Jilted lover, Dinesh, ended his life on Diwali day as his girl friend walked out on him.

Hirabhai Chagganbhai of Naroda too ended his life on Diwali night when he set himself afire after dousing himself with kerosene. The cause behind Hirabhai taking the extreme step is not known. On the New Yearâ€™s day, 32-year-old Lilaram Gurunali of Sardarnagar in the city set himself afire in an open ground outside the Saibaba temple in Sardarnagar.

Gurunali was suffering from some mental illness.

1,Pattern behind violence still remains unclear,"AHMEDABAD: Is there a method in the riots in the city? These are spontaneous outbreak of violence, assert some senior officers. But some people canâ€™t help attempting to keep up the heat till December 12, the polling date for the assembly elections.

Whatever the cause, the immediate reason cited behind each fresh outbreak of violence centres either around a road accident, or a trivial argument that snowballs into a communal clash.

For instance the Wednesday night violence that left over seven persons injured, at least one of whom was injured in police firing in the Jamalpur area.

Local police officials posted at Vaishya Sabha where the violence erupted asserted that trouble started after two scooters collided. They said: â€œOne of the scooterists was drunk, and the scuffle between the two became a communal matter.â€�

A senior police official, on the other hand, had a different story to tell. â€œTrouble broke out when some youths argued with a tea-stall owner near the Jawahar Chowk area. Members from both communities joined in the squabble, and the incident assumed communal colour.â€� But the official statement issued by the city police said that the cause behind Jamalpur rioting was firecracker bursting. Similar seemingly innocuous firecracker explosions in Shahpur and Danilimda were stated as the cause behind incidents of stonethrowing and violence that took place on Thursday.

At Gomtipur, where six shops were burnt and six persons were injured in rioting on Thursday evening, the cause is equally unclear. Additional commissioner of police (sector II) Satish Verma said: â€œThe violence at Gomtipur remains a mystery. We are trying to ascertain facts from the people who we have detained from the Pujari Ki Chali area. It is, however, too premature to say that these riot incidents were being orchestrated by people with vested interests.â€�

Police officials say that while these incidents look sporadic, spontaneous and unrelated, a pattern can indeed be established looking at the fact that both sides look in a state of preparedness to come out on the streets at the slightest provocation.

2,"BJP poll campaign to focus on farm sector, co-op banks","GANDHINAGAR: Worried about the adverse fallout on its election prospects following scams in the co-operative bank sector, the ruling BJPâ€™s election manifesto committee is likely to promise the electorate a stricter control mechanism for the banks.

The manifesto this time could accord a high priority to agriculture sector by promoting medicinal plants like Isabgul and other crops with great export potential. Other aspects likely to have an impact on the farm sector â€” like the power situation as well as health of the co-operative bank sector â€” will also be given top priority, party sources said.

The last four-and-half years of BJP regime has seen the collapse of several co-operative banks in the state and the Congress has gone on the offensive in this regard accusing the BJP government of doing precious little to help the depositors. The BJP has decided to take a serious note of the crisis looming large over the cooperative sector, particularly in the banks, and the manifesto committee has decided to promise drastic changes in the existing co-operative Act to restore the faith of small depositors in co-operative banks having over 1,500 branches and deposits worth Rs 16,000 crore.

â€œWe will propose to the state government that the RBI should provide insurance cover to deposits totalling to Rs 5 lakh instead of Rs 1 lakh, so that a large number of depositors could be saved in case of closure of the bank,â€� a party source said. Besides, the committee will also recommend for a mechanism aimed at more â€œchecks and balancesâ€� in the functioning of the co-operatives banks.

Though the election manifesto committee is still busy discussing various points to be included in the manifesto, it is believed that the BJP would go for a major shift and adopt market-oriented methods to raise the growth rate of agriculture in the state to around 4 per cent from the present 2 per cent. â€œWe have decided to take monopoly agricultural produce like Isabgul and other ayurvedic medicines to world markets which will earn more foreign exchange and remunerative prices to farmers,â€� a reliable party source said.

Another important point to be included in the manifesto is to offer financial help to small and marginal farmers so that they could undertake farming of monopoly crops. If need be, farmers will be allowed to have financial partner for the farming operations.

State agriculture commissionerate will create a special channel for the marketing and selling of such agricultural produce, which will be procured right from the farms and transported in containers for the shipment abroad. The committee has proposed setting up of a special arrangement to execute the export orders. In view of growing dissension among farmers about erratic power supply, the committee will urge the leadership to ensure a fair deal for agriculturists. Despite a promise to supply electricity for 16 hours, the farmers are not even provided power for nine hours.

The BJP has for the first time appointed some noted experts like Dr Bharat Gariwala and former IAS Jhaverbhai Chavda to draft the manifesto for the crucial Assembly elections. The 10-member manifesto committee is headed by deputy chairman of the state planning board Suryakant Acharya.

The committee will submit its draft manifesto to the central leadership by the end of this week and the manifesto will be finalised only after approval from Delhi.

3,Crisis not to affect RS polls: Rajnath,"KANPUR: Former chief minister and senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Rajnath Singh claimed that the ongoing political crisis in the state would not affect the ensuing Rajya Sabha polls. Claiming that the Mayawati government would complete its full term, he said that the political crisis gripping the state would be resolved soon.

Talking to mediaperons at the BNSD Shiksha Niketan here on Thursday, Rajnath said that he would file nomination papers soon. Elections to the ten Rajya Sabha seats in the state will be held on November 18. Ruling out the possibility of the current political crisis affecting the RS elections, Rajnath said that the party would again emerge victorious at the hustings.

The former chief minister refused to comment on the functioning of the coalition government but added that it was facing no threat. When asked if the disgruntled MLAs of the party enjoyed his support, Rajnath said that â€œpeople hold different opinions in politics and often indulge in mud slinging without knowing the reality.â€� He was here to meet his two adopted sons Brijendra and Shiv Prasad who are studying at BNSD Shiksha Niketan.

4,CM’s plea for investment in agro sector,"PATNA: At a meeting with deputy general manager of the Industrial Finance Commission of India (IFCI) Ltd A K Das on Thursday, chief minister Rabri Devi stressed the need for stepping up investment in agro-based industries in the state.

Earlier, Das called on the CM at her residence. The CM told him that there was a huge potential in agro-industries sector in Bihar and that the IFCI should explore the areas suitable for huge investments in that sector.

She also urged the IFCI to provide financial support for reviving the sick industrial units in Bihar.

She said that the IFCI should do survey of the sick jute and sugar industrial units and give its advice to the state government about the measures required to rejuvenate them with adequate financial support.

Das apprised the CM about the plan to rejuvenate three industrial units in the state, a release issued by the state government said. The CM also issued a directive for exploring the possibilities of investments in Bihar.

The ultimate aim should be to step up investments in Bihar for which the financial institutions like the IFCI would be of great help, she added.

Tourism minister Ashok Kumar Singh, chief secretary S N Biswas, principal secretary Mukund Prasad, secretary, tourism, R S Tiwari and secretary, industries, Ashok Kumar were also present at the meeting.

Das later met former chief minister Laloo Prasad Yadav and discussed about the potentials of industrial development in the state.

5,Mid-term polls: Is the threat for real?,"LUCKNOW: Chief minister Mayawati recently exhorted her party workers to be prepared for mid-term polls. â€œIf this government goes, there will be polls in Uttar Pradesh,â€� she said at a meeting of the BSP office-bearers held at her residence.

Mayawati said that she had already taken the central leaders of the BJP into confidence for holding mid-term polls after dissolving the Vidhan Sabha in the event of collapse of this government. After saying so, she warned the MLAs against falling into the trap laid by the opposition leaders.

Earlier, speaking in Saharanpur on Saturday, she had said that the BSP workers should keep themselves ready for a snap poll because she wanted to run the government on her own strength and not on the crutches of others.

A similar threat was held out be the UP BJP president Vinay Katiyar when he said at a press conference that â€œif the BJP dissidents persisted with their rebellion, it might force a poll in the state.â€�

Much before these statements, the BJP legislature party leader Lalji Tandon, who is in the of thick of controversy, had said that the dissidentsâ€™ activities might precipitate a crisis which may eventually force a mid-term poll in the state.

Now that the dissident activity is not showing any sign of abating, how serious are the utterances of the BJP and BSP leaders about the mid-term polls? According to some political leaders, the possibility of another election being forced on the state cannot be ruled out.

If the dissidence is not contained, the government would either place the House under suspended animation or recommend its dissolution to avoid embarrassment before the next session which is due sometime in February.

Reports from various parts of the state indicate that the situation at the ground level favours the BSP. The other advantage for the BSP is that the BJPâ€™s credibility has touched its nadir. BJPâ€™s loss may be BSPâ€™s gain, said a political worker.

Some political workers, however, see hollow threats in these statements. â€œWhy would the BJP go to the people at a time when it stands to lose most of the seats it had won in the previous polls,â€� they argue.

Those who see the threat as real point out that going to the hustings would be preferable to handing over power to Mulayam Singh Yadav.

6,Patient commits suicide at Ruby hospital,"KOLKATA: A 78-year-old patient jumped to death from the third-floor balcony of Ruby General Hospital on Thursday. The suicide came only a few hours before his release.

â€œOwing to prolonged illness and successive operations, he was extremely depressed,â€� said the police. The height of the railing which the patient apparently climbed to jump down precluded the possibility of foul play.

Tarak Chandra Ghosh, a resident of Mograhat in Hooghly district, went to the balcony for a walk. â€œBut a little later a nurse heard a thud and raised an alarm. The security personnel found him lying in a pool of blood on the ground floor,â€� said Tapas Mukherjee, chief manager of the hospital.

A patient of urology department, Ghosh underwent surgery a few days ago. Though he was supposed to be released on Wednesday, his relatives failed to turn up. So, he would have been discharged on Thursday, informed Mukherjee.

7,"RJD govt is directionless, says Mishra","NAWADA: The former chief minister and the national secretary of Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) Dr Jagannath Mishra has termed the RJD government as directionless, non-development oriented, anti-Dalit and anti-minorities.

Talking to mediapersons here, Mishra accused the people and political parties of Bihar of being non-aware and non-sensitive towards the development of the state.

To drive home his point, he claimed that during his regime in 1980''s, the GDP of Bihar was 5.5 per cent but in the Laloo-Rabri regime it is only 0.5 per cent, which shows that Bihar is on the lowest stage of development as compared to the other states of India. Mishra said that Bihar is at the lowest point in respect of all the key indicators of development such as per capita income, per capita consumption, per capita consumption of energy etc.

The NCP leader said that during the eighth and ninth five-year plans, Bihar government was sanctioned Rs 13,000 and Rs 16,600 crore respectively by the Central government for various development schemes but the state government could spend only Rs 5,400 and Rs 9,000 crore.

He claimed that extremism has spread its tentacles due to rise in poverty and unemployment in the past 12 years. ""Not a single industry has been set up by the government during the period.""

8,Lawyers protest court fee hike,"KOLKATA: The Bar Council of West Bengal on Thursday â€” the day the courts opened after the Puja break â€” registered their protest against the state governmentâ€™s decision to raise court fees.

The state government, through an ordinance, has doubled court fees in all cases dealing a severe blow to litigants, especially the poor. In a few cases the fees have been raised four to five times. The court fee related to property transactions has been increased from Rs 10,000 to Rs 50,000. â€œWe have done this in accordance with the direction of the Supreme Court. The apex court has, however, set the upper limit for the highest possible application fee at Rs 75,000,â€� Raghunath Roy, joint secretary of state judicial department, told TNN on Thursday.

The court fee payable for filing a writ petition has been increased from Rs 100 to Rs 200. Fees for cases at the high court dealing with tax matters have also been increased from Rs 250 to Rs 500. However Roy said no fee is required for a writ petition if it is in the nature of a habeas corpus.

From now, every petition for restitution of conjugal rights, judicial separation, divorce or divorce by mutual consent under the Special Marriage Act, 1954, and every memorandum of appeal under Section 39 will be charged Rs 100. The same amount would have to be paid for filing a petition or appeal under other marriage Acts, except petitions under Section 44 and 55.

Bar Council executive chairman Uttam Majumder told reporters the government had raised the fees without informing the council. Majumder alleged that the government has taken the decision without consulting the highest statutory body of 60,000 lawyers in the state. He said not even a copy of the Ordinance has been sent to the council and that it had come to know of it through newspaper reports. The council has demanded that the government revoke or withdraw the Ordinance immediately or else there would be a massive agitation.

The West Bengal Court-Fees (Amendment) Ordinance was promulgated on October 28. However, the government order was sent to the high court and concerned departments, including the state administrative tribunal, tenancy tribunal, land reforms and premises tenancy tribunal, Wakf tribunal and the income tax appellate tribunal, on Thursday.

With the promulgation of the Ordinance, government revenue from court-fees would increase three-fold.

9,Basu pulls up party panchayat practices,"KOLKATA: Former chief minister Jyoti Basu has advised the CPM leadership to cleanse the party of corruption and nepotism in the three-tier panchayat in the state.

Basu was addressing party colleagues after inaugurating a permanent party school in Kolkata on Thursday. The school has been set up in the old building of the Kolkata CPM district committee office as part of the partyâ€™s image-building exercise.

Basu in his speech was candid enough to admit vices in the panchayat system. â€œIt is unfortunate that malpractice and corruption have crept into the panchayat system,â€� he remarked. Basu was critical of the local CPM committees which, he felt, were glossing over the negative aspects of the partyâ€™s work in the panchayats.

He also felt that some party leaders were not being able to overcome the â€œlure of moneyâ€�.

10,Kelkar farm tax likely to be shelved,"NEW DELHI: Taxing agricultural income is being seen as a ""political minefield"", regardless of the compelling case made out by the Kelkar taskforce for at least taxing agricultural income of non-agriculturists.

The move is bound to be resisted not only by the politically influential farm lobby but also by politicians, many of whom pass on a huge part of their non-agriculture income as farm income and claim tax exemption, according to tax officials.

Not to speak of the Opposition, even the ruling BJP is not inclined at supporting the move that may be seen as ""anti-agriculture"".

BJP chief Venkaiah Naidu, in a statement in Chennai earlier this week, has already expressed himself against any move to tax agriculture income.

""We have to look at the Kelkar proposal carefully. It is perhaps not the right time to talk of taxing agriculture income. Farmers are already restive with the structural changes being introduced in agriculture such as hiking the user charges for power and water,"" said convener of the BJPâ€™s economic cell P N Vijay.

Since farm income was exempt from tax, it had become a conduit for tax evasion, the taskforce on direct taxes said in its recent consultation paper on direct tax reforms released for public debate. It estimated that tax evasion through the laundering of non-agricultural income as farm income amounted to a whopping Rs 1,000 crore annually.

The modus operandi is simple. A large number of tax-payers ""turn farmers"" and pass on huge incomes from non-agriculture activities as ""agriculture income"" in their tax returns and claimed an exemption from tax, said a tax administrator.

The taskforce took a close look at a large number of returns filed in Mumbai and found that a number of tax-payers had claimed large amount of income from agricultural operations. Since such income enjoyed exemption from the Central income-tax and there is no such tax effectively in place in states, such tax-payers enjoyed favourable treatment vis-a-vis those earning equivalent level of income from non-agriculture activities.

Prima facie, the claims for income from agriculture operations appeared to be doubtful to most tax officers since agriculture operations are claimed to have been carried out in areas which are known to be infertile.

Following the Mumbai scrutiny, the income-tax department has launched large-scale investigations against such claims.

11,NDA govt a comprehensive failure: Sonia,"MOUNT ABU, Rajasthan: Attacking the BJP-led NDA government for being a ""comprehensive failure"", Congress President Sonia Gandhi on Friday said that the country was once again looking up to the party to revive economic growth, foster social peace and enhance India''s stature in the world.

""The BJP-led NDA government has just completed three years in office at the Centre. The country has seen through the hollow claims made by the coalition which has been a comprehensive failure,"" Gandhi said while opening the fourth conclave of Congress chief ministers at this hill resort.

Gandhi exhorted party leaders and workers to focus on grassroot developments and show how fundamentally different the Congress could be from the BJP.

She said that the people were looking forward to the Congress to provide a government that could govern and an administration that could administer.

Sending a strong signal to the Congress leaders to be prepared for the next general elections, Gandhi said that the polls were only two years away and wanted the party to consolidate its position by retaining power in states ruled by them and oust the BJP and its allies from states where they were in power.

""It is because of the Congress idealogy, hard work and commitment that the people are looking at the party to provide a government which should be fundamentally different from the non-Congress political parties,"" she said.

The conclave is being convened to review the performance of the 14 Congress ruled states in the light of ''Guwahati Resolve'', which pledged to provide good governance.

12,Law to be enforced rigidly in Gujarat polls: EC,"NEW DELHI: In a warning to politicians seeking to exploit religion for political gains, the Election Commission has said that it would enforce the law ""rigidly"" in Gujarat in the coming Assembly elections.

""Absolutely, people who use that sort of language should be prosecuted. We have to hasten that process,"" Chief Election Commissioner J M Lyngdoh said to a private TV channel.

He was replying to a question on how the Commission would ensure trouble-free elections in Gujarat when there were press interviews and statements by leaders on communal lines.

Asked specifically whether he was talking about people like VHP leader Praveen Togadia, the CEC said ""it could be anybody. Whoever it is"".

To a question whether the Commission could use its authority to send out a message to contain such speeches and statements, he said ""yes. We will do that.""

Stating that the Commission had been routinely doing that in every election, Lyngdoh said that the Commission would very closely monitor all election speeches and enforce the law ""rigidly"".

14,Mayawati govt still enjoys majority: Governor,"KANPUR/LUCKNOW: Uttar Pradesh governor Vishnu Kant Shastri on Friday said the BJP-BSP government in the state still enjoyed majority as no ruling combine legislators had given him letters of withdrawal of support.

Shastri said though some Independent and BJP legislators and a BSP MLA had met him to express their grievances against the Mayawati-led government, no one had so far given him in writing that they were withdrawing support.

The Samajwadi Party, meanwhile, demanded the governorâ€™s removal and said an inquiry be conducted by a sitting high court judge on the cases lodged against the dissident MLAs. A demand for the immediate convening of the Vidhan Sabha session was also raised.

Shastri, however, refused to comment on SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadavâ€™s remark that he was acting as an â€˜â€˜agent of the BJPâ€™â€™.

In a fresh offensive, BJP dissidents fielded arms-dealer Suresh Nanda as their candidate for Rajya Sabha byelections in the state. The move is seen as a virtual trial of strength for the beleaguered Mayawati ministry.

Nanda is pitted against hotelier Lalit Suri, who is said to enjoy the tacit support of the BSP-BJP combine.

Kovid Kumar Singh, a rebel BJP MLA, said they decided to nominate Nanda after receiving the â€˜â€˜green signalâ€™â€™ from the SP, which is the largest single group with 144 MLAs in the 403-member assembly.

In another development, the judicial remand of Independent legislators Raghuraj Pratap Singh alias Raja Bhaiyya and Dhananjay Singh was extended by 60 days. Earlier, addressing a joint press conference, SP national general-secretary Rewati Raman Singh and secretary Shivpal Singh Yadav said the right authority to decide the minority or majority status of the government was the Speaker and not the governor.

15,Congress will lead the next govt: Sonia,"MOUNT ABU: Delhi''s seat of power appears closer to the Congress party from this mountain retreat. The party president Sonia Gandhi aired her apprehensions of ""the progressive weakening of the Centre,"" while terming the NDA government a comprehensive failure. In the next general elections, she feels people would vote Congress to power.

So, her message to the chief ministers of the Congress ruled states was: ''Much more needs to be done to retain power in Congress-ruled states'' and to oust BJP and its allies from the rest of the states. The ""businesslike and purposeful"" CMs'' conclave began here on Friday morning to discuss among other things survival strategies in Gujarat and nine other states that would go to polls later.

In no uncertain terms, she told 11 CMs that much more can be done in the states. Asking them to be self-critical, not to exaggerate their achievement and to acknowledge their shortcomings as perceived by the people, Gandhi said the Congress has failed to show how different it was from the BJP.

""I have been interacting in a systematic manner with experts and professionals in various fields...the fact that we are in so many states gives us a unique opportunity to show how fundamentally different we are from our political opponents... But the experts I have met emphasised that much more needs to be done and can be done so that there is a visible and tangible improvement in the lives of all people more specifically of the weaker sections of the society --- the dalits, the adivasis, the minorities, the backward classes and women.""

And it is for this reason that this fourth meeting of the Congress CMs has an ""innovation in the agenda,"" with experts on agriculture, social development and infrastructure talking to Congress leaders on ""what more we should be doing.""

Though the Congress has been maintaining that Gujarat would not figure in the discussions, that was the second point in Gandhi''s inaugural address. She made a reference to the Vishwa Hindu Parishad leader Praveen Togadia''s attack on her, saying, ""We are fighting forces who will stoop to any level in word and deed to spread poison, to inflame society. We are going to the people of Gujarat with one over-riding message of religious tolerance and understanding, of social reconciliation and amity.""

In fact, Gandhi appealed to the Gujarati community''s business sense. ""Economic success can only be sustained if bigotry is defeated,"" she said.

And the anticipation of power at the Centre was all over Gandhi''s speech. She claimed that the country has seen through BJP''s ""hollow claims"" and that the ""country is looking to the Congress to provide a government that will govern and lead an administration that will administer.""

16,Rajya Sabha polls pointer to UP's future,"NEW DELHI: Arms dealer Suresh Nanda''s decision to file his nomination papers simultaneously for two Rajya Sabha seats in Uttar Pradesh has upset the calculations of all the major parties, with the BJP - which is the least sure of the loyalty of its MLAs - the most worried. Party sources admitted that this might jeopardise one of the two elections it is contesting: A senior party leader said, ""This has really upset the applecart.""

The major political parties in UP had hoped that if they fielded exactly 10 candidates amongst themselves - depending on their relative strengths for the 10 Rajya Sabha seats in the biennial elections later this month, they would be able to eliminate the role of money power altogether. As for the 11th seat - vacated by TN Chaturvedi after he was appointed governor of Karnataka - the BJP had decided it would be best not to contest it even though it had been a party seat, lest the voting on its exposed the divisions in its ranks.

But now with 11 contestants for the first 10 seats, and Nanda - who has the backing of the rebel BJP MLAs - one of them, the BJP is now concerned that cross-voting may endanger the chances of one of its candidates - former chief minister Rajnath Singh or party general secretary Mukthar Abbas Naqvi. The latter is more vulnerable, say party sources, with Singh being not just the more senior leader but the one with sympathisers among the dissidents.

In the 403-member house, the Samajwadi Party (142) had fielded four candidates, the BSP (99) three, the BJP (88) two and the Congress (25) one, adding upto the 10 vacancies. But now with an independent, Suresh Nanda, also in the fray, there is the likelihood of an election, unless the nomination papers of any of the above is not accepted.

As for the by-election, Nanda and industrialist Lalit Suri have filed their nomination papers and this contest, say political sources, should see money flowing like water. All the 10 proposers for the Nanda''s candidature are rebel BJP MLAs, while Suri is believed to enjoy the tacit support of the state''s ruling BSP-BJP coalition. One of Nanda''s BJP backers, MLA Kovid Kumar Singh, has been reported as saying that he and his fellow BJP rebels had decided to nominate Nanda after getting a green signal from the SP.

If Nanda''s nomination for the biennial seat is not rejected - some techinical objections were raised on Friday - he poses a danger to the BJP candidates. If Nanda defeats Suri in the by-election, it will be a slap in the face of the BJP and BSP, since everyone knows they are unofficially backing Suri.

BJP sources say that with no signs of the rebellion in the BJP be dying out, the thinking in the leadership is to do a holding operation - with the help of governor Vishnu Kant Shastri and Speaker Kesarinath Tripathi - till after the Gujarat polls and then go in for a dissolution of the state assembly and fresh polls in which the BJP and BSP will contest together. Apparently, chief minister Mayawati, who has been steadily consolidating her position, is also amenable to the idea.

17,BJP MLAs want 20 ministers dropped,"AHMEDABAD: The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party in the state is flooded with representations against at least 15 to 20 members of the dissolved assembly including some ministers like Hemant Chapatwala, Kaushikbhai Patel, Narottam Patel, Bharat Barot and Ishverbhai Makwana demanding that they should be not be renominated for the ensuing assembly election.

Protests have also been lodged against sitting members Dr Mayaben Kodnani, Amit Shah, Chandravadan Patel, Rekhaben Dwivedi, Chandravadan Patel, Sunil Oza, Amarish Patel and Dhanraj Kella. Observers continued apprising state election committee about the representations they had received from various quarters in districts they have been assigned.

â€œParty workers told observers during their visits that if these members were renominated, the party would suffer a heavy loss in the elections,â€� a senior party functionary told TNN on Friday.

State BJP president Rajendrasinh Rana, Keshubhai Patel, Chief Minister Narendra Modi, Kashiram Rana and Suresh Mehta have been sitting for long hours in Gandhinagar for the past two days hearing in turn ticket aspirants for each of the 182 assembly constituencies.

The state election committee is likely to wind up the exercise by Saturday and state BJP chief Rana will carry the list of candidates for final approval of partyâ€™s central parliamentary board in New Delhi. However, when contacted, Rana refused to give any details saying the picture would clear only by next week.

In South Gujarat, Kashiram Rana and Narottam Patel are determined to settle scores with the C R Patil faction. Patil is allegedly involved in Diamond Cooperative Bank scam in Surat. The pro-Rana group has demanded ticket for former city mayor Fakirbhai Chauhan in place of law minister Hemant Chapatwala but on the other side the Patil group has waged a war against water supply minister Narottam Patel.

From Ahmedabad city and district, several workers have pleaded that Bharat Barot and Amit Shah should not be renominated, but it is believed that their plea may fall on deaf ears as both of them are Modi supporters with Barot being the new entrant to the Modi camp.

Party sources said women and youth workers were more enthusiastic this time to contest elections and both BJP Mahila Morcha and Yuva Morcha have reportedly submitted a big list of nominees.

There has been a strong representation for renomination of education minister Anandiben Patel and women and child welfare minister Jasumatiben Korat.

The mahila morcha has also sought tickets for former Ahmedabad district panchayat president Ramilaben Desai, Vasuben Trivedi, chairperson of the State Tourist Development Corporation, Kaushalya Kuvarba a leading social worker from Sabarkantha and for Jayshriben Patel, former Surat mayor Geetaben Desai, Bhavnagar mayor Vibhavariben Dave, Leelaben Aankhalia, Hansaba Raj and Meenaben Pandya.

The BJP Yuva Morcha has staked its claim for at least six places which include ticket for their president Amit Thaker who wishes to contest from Sabarmati assembly constituency. While others whose names are making the rounds include Jitu Hirpara, Tushar Patel, Ishverbhai Patel, Kiran Patel and Kanjibhai Patel.

Kiran Patel, an Adivasi from South Gujarat, wishes to take on leader of Opposition Amarsinh Chaudhary in tribal Khedbrahma constituency.

18,60 held for Thursday's Ahmedabad rioting,"AHMEDABAD: Even as tempers seemed to have cooled down on Friday, the city police have arrested more than 60 persons for their involvement in Thursdayâ€™s rioting.

Those arrested have been charged with physical assault, arson and looting.

Thursday eveningâ€™s violence in Gomtipur area, in which nine persons were injured, and six shops and two vehicles were burnt, was brought under control by the city police only after firing 18 rounds and lobbing 98 teargas shells.

Instances of arson and looting continued till late evening, albeit with much less vigour. Violence peaked again when an autorickshaw was set ablaze and the driver was beaten up by a mob near Pujari ki Chali. This was followed by a mob attack on two motorcycle riders. The duo were dragged away and severely thrashed in the same area before the police rescued them.

When senior police officials lead by Addl CP (sector II) Satish Varma and Addl CP (sector I) Satish Sharma rushed to the Pujari ki Chali area around 6.30 pm, local residents greeted them with a shower of stones.

The riotous mobs could be brought under control only after they were teargassed and lathicharged. Forty-two persons were rounded up by the city police on charges of rioting in the Gomtipur area.

19,Advocates protest amendment to legal services authorities act,"AHMEDABAD: Joining the nation-wide protest against the amendment to the Legal ServicesAuthorities Act and the Centreâ€™s volte face on the issue, members of the Bar Council of Gujarat (BCG) staged a dayâ€™s token dharna the Income-Tax circle here on Friday.

They claimed that minister for legal affairs and justice Jana Krishnamurthy had promised the Council in writing that its representation about the amendment will be considered. However, the government acted contrary to the promise.

â€œThe 2002 amendments to the Act, will mean more trouble for the litigants and common people. We believe that will pose problems in the jurisdiction of the civil courts and cause problems in the process of justice,â€� said Council chairman Bahadursinh Jadeja.

A large number of members of the Council and its office-bearers joined the daylong token fast. â€œBecause of the amendment, the seniormost judge becomes the chairman of the Lok Adalat and can appoint any two persons of his choice, irrespective of the background of the person,â€� said advocate Afzalkhan Pathan.

â€œThese members could be someone without a legal background or could even be illiterate. Whatever judgement they deliver, will be final and cannot be challenged in the civil court,â€� he said.

Protesting the amendment as â€œunjustâ€�, secretary R R Shukla said â€œUsually, both parties agree on going to the Lok Adalat and, therefore, the decision would be binding on both the parties. But now even if one of the litigants prefers not to go to Lok Adalat, he will be forced to do so. This is injustice, as going to an alternative legal mechanism cannot be forced on someone.â€�

What has really irked the advocates is the provision that bars the advocates from taking part in the legal proceedings at the Lok Adalat.

â€œThe litigants will have to represent themselves as there will be no lawyers to help them. In other words, they will be forced to accept the decision taken by the panel,â€� Shukla feared.

The Bar Council members expressed fear about the fate of the millions engaged in the legal profession. â€œWe are going back to the ancient panchayat system,â€� said advocate Anil Kella.

â€œWe are also worried about the kind of people making it to the Lok Adalat, since there are no restrictions on their selection,â€� said the advocates. The legal eagles also challenged the governmentâ€™s stance in limiting the scope of the Lok Adalat. â€œWhy are the Lok Adalats limited only to motor accident claims and maintenance cases? Why are the criminal cases not decided there? Why is the government not transferring its cases to the Lok Adalats?â€� they demanded.

Meanwhile, in Baroda, lawyers will boycott all programmes organised by the district and state legal services authorities on Saturday, on the occasion of the National Legal Literacy Day, in response to the nation-wide protest call given by the Bar Council of India (BCI) and Bar Council of Gujarat (BCG).

In a decision taken by the Baroda Bar Association, the city lawyers will also boycott the Lok Adalat and legal literacy camp for handicapped persons to be held by the district legal services authority.
