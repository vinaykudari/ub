6,President’s nod for AP crime law,"new delhi/hyderabad: president k r narayanan on tuesday gave his assent to the andhra pradesh control of organised crime bill seeking to prevent, and control organised crime. the bill provides that whoever commits an offence of organised crime shall be punishable with death or life imprisonment and a fine of a minimum of rs 1 lakh. the new law will come in handy for the state police as they tackle the increasing activities of organised crime syndicates. the law is modelled on a similar one enacted in maharashtra, and empowers the police with vast powers with regard to arrest, detention and tapping of communications of suspects. just last week, the hyderabad police had arrested a three men allegedly owing alliance to the underworld don chota shakeel. the three men were alleged to be involved in the trade of pistols. the police had earlier nabbed a couple of members of the dawood ibrahim gang who had entered the city in a bid to extort ransoms from local businessmen. sources suspect that the organised crime gangs operating in the country have now extended their activities to andhra pradesh.these gangs also share common interests with terrorist outfits, especially cross-border narco-terrorism. much before the the andhra pradesh control of organised crime bill was passed in the assembly, a number of civil rights organisations and opposition parties expressed reservations about possible misuse of its provisions by police officials. however, police officials argue that apcoca has enough safeguards to prevent such misuse.

10,Sharad Joshi tells farmers to protect Bt gene,"ahmedabad: the sharad joshi-led shetkari sangathan has rallied support for cotton farmers in gujarat who are being threatened that their standing crops would be destroyed because they had used an unapproved hybrid variety of genetically engineered seeds. joshi, in a statement on behalf of the kisan coordination committee (kcc), said the khedut samaj of gujarat would hold a kisan rally in bharuch on october 30 on this issue. the rally will be addressed by sharad joshi, bhupender sing mann (punjab) and prem simha dahiya (haryana), among others. joshi said gujarat's farmers had been able to save their crop of cotton from the attack of bolloworms, thanks to the use of a special seed. the crops from all other seeds have been devastated by the pest. use of bt-gene cotton seed in india was blocked by the union ministry of environment and forests last may, even though other cotton-producing countries have gone ahead with the use of transgenic cotton. joshi said the ''green lobby'' in india is all out to have the plots in question uprooted. this lobby, led by vandana shiva and karnataka rajya ryot sangh president nanjunda swami, have been uprooting trial plots of bt-gene cotton and are happy that the government security forces are doing the uprooting now. the kcc, he said, had always stood for freedom of access to markets and to technology for indian farmers. the kcc had strongly protested against the blocking of the bt-gene seed and had alleged that ''the government's decision is equivalent to sending the jawans to kargil armed with .303 rifles to face the enemy wielding automatic machine guns.'' he said the government's decision to destroy the standing crop without any compensation was entirely unjust. the farmers used the seeds that they could procure through normal channels and could not be faulted if the seed eventually turned out to be of transgenic variety. it was government's duty to ensure that the proscribed seed was not marketed. this year, cotton crop has failed in gujarat with the exception of that form the proscribed variety.

12,Massive rigging in TN civic elections,"chennai: for the first time in tamil nadu's history, mass scale rigging and muscle power was witnessed by the electorate last week as the civic polls were held thoroughout the state. repolling was ordered in as many as 499 booths, while the dmk, congress and independent candidates cried foul in many more booths. as one aiadmk supporter admitted, he and a few other party supporters entered booths in chennai, with the police watching, and stamped ballot papers in favour of aiadmk candidate n. balaganga for mayorship. they also tried to see that sitting mayor m.k. stalin of the dmk did not have enough councillors to support him, if he was returned to power. this was also an election where the voter turnout reached an all-time low, especially during the re-poll when many people decided to stay home instead of being barred from casting their vote. what appalled the electorate the most was the way in which aiadmk men allegedly entered and invalidated many of the ballot papers at a counting centre in chennai. an incident of this kind has never taken place earlier. though the dmk, congress and independent candidates cried foul, director-general of police b.p. nailwal denied the involvement of the police, as had been alleged by some of the candidates.

13,Non-operative income fuels Bajaj's Q2 net 131%,"new delhi: a high non-operative income and huge cost cuts helped the country's largest two- and three- wheeler maker bajaj auto ltd tide through a tough q2 ended september 30, 2001. aided by the rs 72 crore income as premium from its insurance partner allianz ag, bajaj auto's bottomline surged ahead with a 131.5 per cent jump to rs 142.03 crore. its income from operations, reflecting the slow pace of scooter sales, inched up by a mere 7.2 per cent in q2 and by 3.06 per cent for the first half of the year to rs 1,057.12 crore and rs 1,972 crore, respectively. after losing about 3 per cent in intra-day trade, the bajaj auto scrip attracted a fresh spate on buying, enthused by the improved financial performance. the scrip ended flat on wednesday at rs 327.20 on bse. other income for q2 stood at rs 103.73 crore, marking a 44 per cent surge over the previous fiscal. this helped the firm earn a total income of rs 1,170.05 crore during the period. bajaj auto president rajiv bajaj said it has also gained from the cost reduction exercise through greater indigenisation, value engineering, supply chain management and review of fixed costs, with special focus on the motorcycle segment. company officials also attributed the improved performance to a realignment of its product portfolio, with greater thrust on motorcycles. bajaj has, for long, been the largest maker of scooters in india, and a shift in consumer preference in the recent years to more powerful bikes had wounded the company. ""we have changed the model mix, with motorcycles now accounting for around 42 per cent of our volumes. we have also planned a string of new bike and scooter launches over the next year as our growth strategy,"" bajaj auto v-p (marketing) ravichandran said.

15,Killer trucks make roads unsafe at night,"new delhi: trucks and cars account for nearly 60 per cent of the road accidents in the city. till october 15, trucks had killed 138 people and injured another 1,694 in 787 accidents and cars had killed 207 people and injured 617 others in 1,646 accidents. the traffic police looks at it differently: ''the numbers are lesser than last year.'' last year, trucks killed 264 persons in 1,009 mishaps and cars mowed down 162 persons in 1,851 accidents. ''a large number of inter-state trucks pass through the city. these vehicles enter from neighbouring states and pass through arterial roads,'' said deputy commissioner of police (new delhi traffic), arun kampani. in the absence of an expressway or a bypass, these trucks continue to ply on city roads disregarding rules and claiming innocent lives, he added. this has come up for objection from the supreme court as well. justice b n kirpal had observed during the october 18 hearing on the cng issue: ''why do these inter-state vehicles have to cross through delhi, if they have to go from one town in haryana or up to another town in the same state, until and unless they want to take a short-cut. why can't they take a longer route?'' although these observations were made with regard to pollution, they hold true for road mishaps as well. and though these trucks have restricted movement — for instance, trucks cannot enter the new delhi area at all, or there is a peak-hour ban on ring road — there is nothing stopping them at night. ''the trucks generally enter delhi after 9.30 pm and continue to ply till 7.30 am,'' another police official said. since they ply mostly at night, most accidents categorised under ''unknown vehicles causing accidents'' are believed to be caused by trucks. this year, till october 15, 447 persons were killed by these unknown vehicles in 1,636 road accidents. although more than 3.5 lakh truck drivers have been prosecuted so far this year, these still remain the vehicles most at fault. ''presence of skeletal traffic police staff at night allows these heavy vehicles a free run,'' said a police official. the 3,500-strong traffic police has been clamouring for more personnel for quite some time. besides, the focus of the campaigns is mostly directed at buses and private vehicles. ''most campaigns and drives are directed at peak-hour traffic. this is because they attract instant publicity,'' the official said. trucks apart, cars form a major segment of killer vehicles. the police cite various steps and drives to keep a check. prominent among these are speeding checks, mobile interception and the 'relax' campaign. next in the category of killer vehicles are contract carriage buses. till october 15, these buses caused 154 deaths in 794 accidents. followed by blueline buses — 52 deaths in 171 accidents — and tempos — 125 deaths in 59 accidents.
