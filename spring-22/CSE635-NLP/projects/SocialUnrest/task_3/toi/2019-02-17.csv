0,Deceptive calm hides the political churning,"rajkot: on the surface life is as usual in rajkot. the roads are chock-a-block with traffic, the bazaars bustling and offices full. there is very little sign of electioneering and if rajkot-2 is the constituency from which narendra modi is contesting his maiden election, then evidence of this is difficult to come by. but appearances are deceptive. modi is himself camping in rajkot and there are some 25-30 mlas and ministers from gujarat and six mps to help him out. there is a small traffic jam at the race course circle. we stop to see what is amiss. the chief minister himself is sitting beside the driver of a maruti esteem and the car has stopped so that modi - returning from an election meeting - can receive felicitations. modi promises to meet us at the bjp''s main election office on yagnik road and when we reach there a little later the man is already at the venue. it''s a tired modi we encounter. his eyes are closed and overcome by tiredness. he doesn''t realise that we''ve entered the room. later, somebody tells us that the chief minister had campaigned till 2 am the previous night. ""so by how many votes will you win ,"" we ask. ""it will all depend on the voter turnout,"" he says. there are only 1,53,000 voters in rajkot-2 and union minister vallabh kathiria, who is modi''s main campaign manager doesn''t expect more than 55 per cent voters to exercise their franchise in this primarily middle class constituency. asked what he was telling the voters, modi said: ""i''ve come to this elite constituency because i''m not one to go to a remote rural seat and have the ballot boxes stuffed. i want validation from the people of this educated constituency so that i can go ahead with my plans."" but how come former chief minister keshubhai patel isn''t campaigning for him? modi merely says: ""he and me are going to sayajigunj and mahua together. in rajkot i have not been able to go door to door, but i have covered each locality."" in the congress office, party chief campaign manager narhari amin is all fire and brimstone. ""we will win and modi will be trounced,"" he declares. but it is generally believed that modi will sail through, we counter, adding there''s no evidence of any congress campaign either. ""don''t make a mistake,"" says amin, who has been camping in rajkot for the last two weeks, ""our candidate ashwin mehta may not be very well known but this also means that nobody has anything against him. the anti-incumbency factor will help us. ""the bjp has done nothing for so many years. the educated voters in rajkot-2 are fed up. neither has the bjp given the ram temple, neither has it solved kashmir nor has it provided water to rajkot''s denizens."" says amin, ""modi will be defeated indirectly by keshubhai himself. the patels are upset that their leader has been upstaged by the man who seeks their vote. bapa naraaj che (keshubhai is upset) is the buzz among the patels. this is a small constituency and a small shift of few thousand votes will seal the fate of modi."" he claims the fact that the congress candidate is a cooperative bank chairman will help the party garner the business community''s vote too. ""these people have traditionally voted for the bjp, but will now desert them,"" he adds. there are hints that the congress campaign in the last few days till february 19 might concentrate on a personal attack on modi centred on his ""character."" this is based on the perception that ''exposures'' of this kind will shake the normally conservative rajkot voter.

1,'Gujarat a favoured state for investments',"vadodara: ""gujarat figures among the 10 favoured states in india for making nvestments. it occupies a prominent place in terms of business partnerships,"" said bernard de montferrand, the ambassador of france to india, here on saturday. he was in city for an informal interaction with the confederation of indian industry (cii). ""french companies are interested in water-related projects. we are also interested in the public services sector, where we can join hands with our local partners and do business,"" montferrand said while explaining the 19th century france model of ''delegation of public services to private companies'', where despite private participation the power still remains vested in the local public. he said public services also cover industries like power, infrastructure and telecom, where the state is already playing a role here. ""we are ready to be an active partner in these businesses besides other areas like software, food processing and textiles,"" he said mentioning chief minister narendra modi''s recent presentation in delhi. ""i am here to convey that we are definitely interested. on the contrary, i sincerely urge industries here to ''think france'',"" he said. quoting india''s growth rate of five per cent and its ongoing bilateral trade relations with france as a healthy trend, montferrand said ""india and france could do much more in the economic field."" ""the budgetary and economic policies put in place in europe and particularly in france are dynamic. in the coming years, investments in india will be favoured. already some of our best companies including gas de france are in india. gujarat being a progressive state is definitely among the top states reckoned for investments,"" he said. making special reference to agricultural produce, montferrand said india is a leading country in terms of agricultural produce, while france is the market leader in food processing technology. ""i don''t understand why we can''t work together in this field,"" he said. montferrand, however, insisted that further bilateral trade relations between the two countries cannot come only through free market practices, but through a holistic policy with exchange and co-operation on culture, health and the environment front. ""we need to interact more in these areas. even tourism is a sector where we can provide you with vital inputs to develop a robust tourism industry,"" he said mentioning that france, which has population of 61 million, receives 75 million tourists every year. he considered the existence of french banks on indian soil as an additional advantage. ""they know the economic network and are conveying to their clients back in france what india holds in terms of business potential,"" he said. talking about france''s willingness in making investments in textile and fashion industry montferrand said, ""we have the best designers and you have the best manufacturing capacities."" earlier, ex-chairman of cii gujarat council ramesh wadhwani bluntly conveyed industrialists'' feelings by saying that ""france was not looking at india very aggressively"". ""china is still a favoured investment ground for france despite the fact that returns on investment there are not high,"" wadhwani said.

2,Keshubhai set for new innings in state politics,"surat: it was a message, not meant for public consumption for political reasons, but perhaps for his bete noire. former chief minister keshubhai patel kept his words, as of now, to campaign for the bjp and not for chief minister narendra modi, by making a whirlwind tour of mahuva assembly constituency and making an exact 19 minutes address to the voters at valod, some 12 km from mahuva town, on saturday. the mystery over patel''s absence from rajkot-2, from where his successor narendra modi is contesting, was resolved in patel''s speech to the voters at valod. he did not refer even for a single occasion the name of the present chief minister. however, he did mention the recently held lok kalyan melas in some parts of the state, which is said to be a political stunt by modi to woo the voters in the three by-elections, scheduled to go to the polls on february 21, in the state. interestingly, almost all the speakers including several ministerial colleagues of modi, preferred to keep keshubhai in good humour by perhaps deliberately not voicing the name of modi in their speeches, which were heavily loaded with praises for the former chief minister patel. no wonder, the body gesture of the former chief minister who reached a public meeting near valod well ahead of the scheduled time gave both local and state level politicians on the dais, ample hint that he had recuperated enough to take on the political challenges afresh. the ice-breaking meeting started around 20 minutes behind schedule as party workers were busy coaxing members of the public to attend the same. initially, there were only 500 persons but the number touched over 3,000 by the time keshubhai picked up the micro-phone. most of the spectators appeared to have gathered there by way of hard persuasion by the party workers. in his speech, keshubhai asserted on the development plans of the bjp at the state level and the fight against terrorism at national level. incidentally, seizure of rdx from anti-socials near navasari on saturday figured in his speech as well. keshubhai appealed to the voters to cast their votes in favour of the bjp. he also made references about plans implemented for the development of tribals in the region during his regime and asked the people to make a thorough comparison between the congress and the bjp, on realistic standards and then to draw their own conclusions. earlier, the bjp candidate manubhai patel for the mahuva assembly by-poll made a brief speech, asking the voters to cast in favour of the bjp, the party which meant business for real development of the down trodden populace in the region. several leaders including the state bjp president rajendrasinh rana addressed the gathering, urging the voters to vote for the bjp for development and political stability.

3,HC notice to govt on computing of perquisites in salary,"ahmedabad: the constitutional validity of rule 3 of the income-tax rules 1962, providing for valuation of perquisites for the purpose of computing income chargeable under the head ''salaries'' has been challenged before the gujarat high court. petitioner iffco officers association of gandhinagar, has sought to restrain the government from treating the difference between the standard licence fees and 10 per cent of the salary as a perquisite, for the purpose of computing tax under the head salaries under the income-tax act, 1961. and also from deducting income-tax at source on such a basis. a division bench comprising justice r k abhichandani and k a puj has issued notices returnable on february 26, to secretary ministry of finance, central board of direct taxes and iffco-gandhinagar. advocate mihir joshi and advocate tanvish bhatt appeared for the petitioners. the fees are charged for the accommodation provided to the employees and the 10 per cent of the salary paid to such employees are considered as a perquisite. it was submitted that the deduction of tax at source was without the authority of law. it was submitted that there was no rational justification of deeming the value of a perquisite in respect of accommodation provided by the employer at 10 per cent of the salary of the employee and in the absence of a provision of computing fair value of the accommodation, renders the valuation on the basis of the impugned rule fortuitous, irrational and arbitrary. the petitioner stated that the fixations of 10 per cent of the salary for calculating the value of the perquisite is unreasonable since it is illogical to determine the norm of rent payable with reference to paying capacity of the employee, which is variable, in respect of the nature of the accommodation, which is fixed and would conceivably give rise to the situation of varying valuation in cases of similar situated employees housed in the different grade of accommodation on account of exigencies of the administration. they submitted that the said rule was discriminatory. since the licence fees have been rationalised on par with the government employees , in case of accommodation provided by the employer, facts being identical, it is considered as a perquisite in the case of employees of the respondents though not in the case of government employees, which is wholly irrational. it was claimed that there was a hostile discrimination between the employees of the same employer who reside in the townships and those who reside in the cities, in which case, the valuation of the perquisite is far lower on account of deduction of the actual rent paid, thereby resulting in a situation where a perquisite is valued lower though the fair rental value of the accommodation is higher.

4,BMC elections project Uddhav as Sena's No. 2,"mumbai: the sweeping success of shiv sena in the elections to the brihanmumbai municipal corporation (bmc) has vastly reinforced uddhav thackeray''s position as the number two man in the party hierarchy, next only to his father, bal thackeray. uddhav, whose position was tacitly challenged by his cousin raj, has convicingly demonstrated that he enjoys the backing of an overwhelming number of sena supporters in the metropolis. right from the word go, it was uddhav''s show all the way, which led raj to complain that he was not consulted at all by his cousin. in fact, the senior thackeray had given his son a free hand so that he may acquire the political savvy and confidence needed to plan and win the crucial elections to the bmc. uddhav did make it a point to consult his father at every step, but sources in the sena said ultimately it was uddhav who not only finalised the party''s electoral gameplan, but also carefully handpicked candidates who could be trusted to stand by him. he also fine-tuned the campaign strategy in cosultation with close aides like subhash desai. when raj thackeray made his differences with uddhav public a few weeks before the february 10 polls, several sena activists feared that this might adversely affect the party''s performance. their fears were stoked when it became clear that raj, who heads the students'' wing of the party, would not be addressing a single meeting in the metropolis. but uddhav has clearly demonstrated that he can sweep the polls independent of raj; but with the backing of his father and the powerful network of vibhag pramukhs (district presidents). interestingly, even if the congress and the nationalist congress party (ncp) had come together, they would not have been able to overtake the saffron alliance. even when the sena was in power, in tandem with with the bharatiya janata party (bjp) for over four years from 1995, the lowprofile uddhav had preferred to give priority to organisational work â€” unlike his flamboyant cousin, raj, who floated the shiv udyog sena ""to help generate employment for maharashtrian youths"". raj has also proved that he can be a crowd puller. in many of the cities where he campaigned, the sena has performed well. but politically speaking, control of the bmc, with a budget of over rs 5,000 crore, is of primary importance for any party. the question being asked in political circles is whether uddhav will now move against raj for publicly voicing his opposition to him. sources in the sena, however, said bal thackeray would not like any rancour in the party and would instead try to bring the cousins together â€” without, of course, in any way weakening uddhav''s current position in the party.

5,NABARD to expedite rural development schemes,"pune: the national bank for agricultural and rural development (nabard) has decided to set-up working groups to chalk out plans to expedite rural infrastructure development schemes. at a state level nabard seminar on ''credit to self-help groups'', principal secretary of planning department jagdish joshi said nabard needs to extend credit on a big way to irrigation,marketing facilities, rural roads, cold storage and power pumps and connections. ""credit given to all these sectors should be much more widespread than it is now,"" stressed joshi. he said funds should also be provided for greater marketing of agricultural produce. with india in the shadows of the world trade organisation (wtos) agreements in agriculture, agriculturists would have to ensure that their produce has the competitive edge, he said. in order to boost exports of farm products, agencies and policy makers will have to focus on better post-harvest technology. ""factors like procurement, processing and preservation should be strengthened,,"" he said. shivajirao deshmukh, maharashtra''s agriculture secretary said nabard should give more loans to agriculture as the set objectives have not been achieved even now. the bank of india, state bank of india and bank of maharashtra were given awards for giving good credit exposure to agriculturists as also for rural development project.

6,Terror in ravines casts shadow on polls,"barhe, etawah: raja hem rudra singhâ€™s house in the village of barhe overlooks golden yellow mustard fields banking down to the confluence of the yamuna and chambal. but the spectacular landscape is deceptive. for the inhabitants of the narrow strip of land between the chambal ravines and the yamuna that runs through the assembly segments of etawah, lakhna and ajitmal in etawah district, life is very hard. singh, the pradhan of barhe, explains: farming is difficult, the area has few educational establishments and, crucially, no jobs. once, most local youth joined the maharaja of gwaliorâ€™s army, after independence the indian army, or police. but no longer. the result: poverty and unemployment have pushed many young men, and even some women such as lovely pandey, into dacoity. but as the social dynamic of the state has changed, so has the caste composition of the gangs. once the gangs were led by thakurs like the legendary malkhan singh or, till recently, brahmins like phakkad alias ramanand tiwari, now in his 80s. most of the current gangs are led by gujjars such as rajjan, nirbhay and salim alias pahalwan. in the past elections, these dacoits would issue â€˜â€˜appealsâ€™â€™ on behalf of candidates of their choice. this time, singh says, they all have gone underground because the uttar pradesh and madhya pradesh governments have launched joint operations against them. the result: caught between the dacoits and the police, life has become even tougher for the villagers. singh explains that the villagers can no longer spend the night in their fields to protect their crops from neelgai because they could be picked up by the police for â€˜â€˜harbouringâ€™â€™ dacoits. indeed some 150 boys from the gujjar community, which has a substantial vote in ajitmal, etawah and lakhna, have been picked up by the police in the last few months. this has created much resentment among gujjars. a group of pradhans and ex-pradhans from neighbouring villages arriving in barhe to campaign for the bjp in fact bitterly criticise the local administration even as they also lash out at mayawati and mulayam singh yadav. the ex-pradhan of rachpura even bursts into tears as he talks of innocent gujjar boys in custody. asked how could they seek votes for the bjp while being so critical of the rajnath singh ministry, they say their only hope is a fellow gujjar, hukam singh, currently energy minister in up. says kunwar singh gujjar, â€˜â€˜you need to have a leader from your caste these days.â€™â€™ but later, kunwar singh follows this correcpondent and whispers: â€˜â€˜donâ€™t write anything bad about mulayam singh yadav â€” he is a good man. but in front of rudra singh â€” a thakur like rajnath singh â€” it is not safe to say anything else. in fact, in this area, it is not safe to being seen supporting anyone except the bjp.â€™â€™ so where will the gujjar vote go on february 18? only the ballot box will tell.

7,Dadua’s farman holds the key,"karvi, chitrakoot: mum is the word in chitrakoot over dreaded dacoit dadua. few venture to speak openly about him and when they do it is only to eulogise his â€˜robin hoodâ€™ image. daduaâ€™s reign of terror is spoken about in hushed tones. dubbed the garibon ka badshah (king of the poor) and amiron ka abhishap (curse of the rich), dadua is a virtual master of the jungles and hilly terrains which divide madhya pradesh from uttar pradesh. his writ runs large in the banda and chitrakoot and is particularly evident during election times. terror is the key word on which he operates. but union home minister lk advani at his election meeting on february 14 at the chitrakoot intermediate college chose to speak about terror of another kind â€” the one perpetuated by terrorists. dadua did not feature anywhere in his scheme of things. he dwelt at length on cross-border terrorism, the attack on parliament and the need to implement poto but maintained a study silence on how the voters were being terrorised and pressurised by the dreaded dacoit to cast their votes in favour of his candidate or the inability of the police to arrest him. advani in effect chose to sidetrack this issue. instead, he tried to strike an emotional chord amongst the constituents by raking up the issue of the renaming of chitrakoot as sahuji maharaj nagar by bahujan samaj party vice-president mayawati. the renaming of chitrahoot, a hallowed centre of pilgrimage for the hindus, is an issue here and people, cutting across party lines, express their opposition. â€œas this is ramâ€™s karambhoomi we will not allow anybody to change its name,â€� averred cp mishra, a retired government officer. but he and others like him are reticient to talk about ram janmamboomi or ayodhya. the bjp and the vhpâ€™s gameplan, they feel, stands exposed on the issue. this explains why the vhpâ€™s much-hyped â€˜sant sammelanâ€™ in january saw only 66 kar sewaks going to delhi from karvi. observes bhagwati prasad tewari, a shop keeper at the ram ghat and an active participant in the 1992 temple movement: â€œthe people have more pressing problems. the temple no longer interests themâ€�. with daduaâ€™s unwritten farman in the form of terror running large in karvi, the results are likely to be on expected lines.

9,Lax laws boost bogus voting,"mumbai: although 21 persons were arrested for bogus voting during the recent civic elections, senior police officials say punishment under the law is too weak to serve as a deterrent. the arrests this time were almost twice the average number, but the bogus voters are back home within a day of being arrested. said a senior ips officer, who did not wish to be named, ""bogus voters are apprehended by the presiding officer at a polling booth. he then lodges a written complaint and hands over the person to the local police station. but the law does not allow us to keep the person in custody for more than 24 hours."" bogus voting is a bailable offence, but the bail amount is usually not large. those arrested for bogus voting this year were released on bail ranging from rs 2,000 to rs 10,000. said an officer, ""candidates who encourage slum dwellers to cast bogus votes bribe their leaders anywhere between rs 10,000 to rs 50,000. it is easy to pay the bail amount and still make a considerable profit."" but what about the prosecution in such cases? additional commissioner (west region) ramarao wagh points out that while the accused are released quickly and without much trouble, the prosecution takes its own sweet time. ""the police, on their own, file chargesheets against the person in the court but he will be asked to depose before a judge only when the case comes up for trial. this may take five to six years,"" he says. during the trial, the police have to go through the rigmarole of tracing the witness who, in this case, is the presiding officer. ""although his written complaint is accepted as documentary evidence, he is expected to testify before the judge,"" an inspector said. the delay in the legal process often results in the acquittal of the accused person. although the police could not provide exact conviction figures in bogus voting cases, sources said that they were abysmally low. the state election commission, too, does not consider it part of its primary work. said b.g. veer, secretary of the state election commission, ""the election commission cannot take cognisance since this is the prerogative of the police and the courts."" mr veer says that he has received only four complaints this year against candidates who were accused of bribing slum dwellers and encouraging them to cast bogus votes. but many candidates contest this. edwin britto, an independent candidate from ward number 74, alleged that there was large-scale bogus voting in his ward. ""people were brought in from outside the ward and asked to cast votes using somebody else''s ration card. how is it possible to identify a person from a ration card? the electoral rolls had names of persons who had died in the last four years. but votes were cast under these names."" mr britto questioned the use of ration cards for identification as it was easy to make a fake card in mumbai. ""in mumbra, the police had seized 2,000 fake ration cards before the elections,"" he pointed out. mr veer said that the election commission had permitted the use of ration cards since it was a supreme court directive. criminal lawyer majeed memon agreed that the existing law under section 171 of the indian penal code was not a deterrent. ""we have to devise some stringent steps to ensure that nobody dares to indulge in bogus voting again.""

10,Rumours drive women to suicide,"bongaon: a woman and her daughter committed suicide in bongaon on friday evening, unable to bear the torture of being misunderstood. police said that vicious rumours of them having illicit relations with some local boys could have forced them to commit suicide. officers investigating the case said ramakanta dutta became furious after hearing such rumours and started misbehaving with his wife pritilata and daughter rinki. of late, his misbehaving bordered on torture. locals said that 35-year-old pritilata and her 17-year-old daughter were very keen about taking part in almost all events in the locality. their enthusiasm was often misinterpreted by a few locals, who started making insinuations. neighbours said there were regular fights in the dutta family. according to police sources, ramkanta confessed that his daughter and wife committed suicide as they had â€˜misunderstoodâ€™ him. police, however, sent the bodies for post mortem to ascertain the nature of death.

11,Left ally RSP flays Big Brother at rally,"kolkata: the cpm has given up its struggle to look after the interests of business houses, alleged rsp, a major partner of the ruling left front. the startling allegation was made on saturday by none other than rsp state secretary debabrata bandyopadhyay at a public meeting on the occasion of the 16th national conference of the party in the city. â€œduring the first seven-eight years after coming to power, the largest front partner was indeed involved in building up a movement. since then, it was more interested in maintaining a status quo with big business houses such as the khaitans, goenkas, todis, kanorias and bajorias. the cpm has made friends with a few industrialists whereas we perceive them to be our enemies,â€� said bandyopadhyay. denying the charges, an embarrassed cpm state secretary anil biswas said his party had organised about 600-650 agitations in the last three-and-a-half years. about 300-350 of them were organised by the front and the rsp even participated in those. replying to the rspâ€™s charges that the cpm was befriending business houses, biswas said, â€œall are our friends, including businessmen and agricultural workers. the bourgeoisie and the big bourgeoisie are different.â€�

12,"Tatas eye government stake in MTNL, BSNL","new delhi: buoyed by the acquisition of videsh sanchar nigam, the tata group now says it is open to acquiring government equity in the other two telecom giants: mahanagar telephone and bharat sanchar nigam. ""i don''t think you can rule tatas out from privatisation process of mtnl and bsnl,"" tata industries managing director kishore chaukar said when asked if the tatas would bid during the divestment of these two telecom companies. ""depends on when it (privatisation) comes. as and when it comes, let us see what is the value of these two companies,"" he added. the group has already indicated that the total investment envisaged in telecom over the next few years may be increased to beyond rs 10,000 crore and a decision is likely within the next four-six weeks. chaukar''s comments follow close on the heels of government indicating last week that it would disinvest its stake in mahanagar telephone nigam and bharat sanchar nigam limited (bsnl) through competitive bidding route. while asserting that no timetable had been set for divesting stake in the two telecom companies, communication minister pramod mahajan said last week that the government would not bar tatas from bidding for these two telecom majors.
