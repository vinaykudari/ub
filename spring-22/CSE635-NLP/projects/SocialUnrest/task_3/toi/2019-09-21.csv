1,BMS-BKS rally against govt’s economic policies on Sep 30,"LUCKNOW: In what could be a major embarrassment for the BJP, both at the centre and in the state, the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (a BJP-affiliated organisation) and the Bharatiya Kisan Sangh have decided to hold a protest rally in front of Vidhan Bhawan on September 30.

Announcing their plans to hold the rally, BMS state president Rama Kant Shukla told mediapersons that the rally would highlight the inherent dangers in going ahead with globalisation and the economic policies of the Uniongovernment which, he added, were harming the labour class. â€œThough we are part of the ruling coalitions, in a way, but we will not compromise on our ideals,â€� he added. The BMS, Shukla pointed out, was vehemently opposed to disinvestment process which, he added, had to be reviewed in the national interest.

BKS organising secretary Hari Prasad Singh said that their organisation was holding the rally to protest against the IMF, the World Bank, the WTO and multinational companies. He also added that they had joined hands with the BMS to pressure the government to withdraw recommendations of the Second National Labour Commission which were blatantly against the interests of the labour class.

2,Ragging incident probe complete; report off media,"LUCKNOW: The four-member committee headed by director, technical education, probing the ragging incident of the Institute of Engineering and Technology, completed recording of statements of students and teachers on Friday. However, doors were shut for mediapersons as none from the committee or IET officers divulged about the findings of the probe done so far. The committee will submit its report to the government.

Sources, however, said that while junior students did admit about blatant ragging on the campus, none could give a clue on the incident which forced Anup Kapoor, BTech I student, to commit suicide. Statements of Anupâ€™s family members were recorded in Kanpur by the members earlier this week. Later, during its last three days stay in Lucknow, the committee interrogated each and every student, teacher and staff, present in the college.

Inquiry committee members skirted queries whether the probe included the disclosures made by the Kanpur police about involvement of a final year student. IET officials reiterated their stance that they had not received any communication from Kanpur police and, thus, had no basis to take action against the said students. However, officers said that they were considering to constitute a system where junior students could report about ragging incidents without revealing their identity.

4,Major rail accident averted between Chinchwad and Akurdi,"PUNE: A major train accident which could have occurred to the Pune-Mumbai Sinhagad Express between Chinchwad and Akurdi railway stations was averted after the railway authorities realised there was a nineinch rail fracture to the track in the early hours of Wednesday morning.Station superintendent of Chinchwad railway station N. D. Gondhe was informed by the 6.10 am, Pune-bound train driver that there was a fracture on the Up track to Mumbai. The authorities immediately visited the spot and found the track fractured at one place and they immediately stopped the 6.35 am Sinhagad Express at Chinchwad railway station.The train express had nearly 1,296 passengers on board. Gondhe added that the Sinhagad Express was let through around 7.53 am after installing a temporary track.When asked the reason for the fracture, Gondhe said it was the temperature and other technical factors which led to the fault. He confirmed that there was no tampering of any kind with the track.The Sinhagad Express is used by office- goers to Mumbai as the train, which starts from Pune around 6 am reaches Mumbai by 10 am.Divisional traffic manager Brijendra Kumar said there could have been a major problem if the fault was not detected. He assured that the track has been repaired and there was no problem.Kumar added that other trains to Mumbai like the Deccan Queen, Pragati Express, Shayadhari Express and some of the local Pune-Lonavala trains were also delayed for nearly an hour.

5,MSEB needs reforms to attract investments,"MUMBAI: The Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) will need investments of Rs 30,475 crore over the next decade to keep abreast of technological advances and the growing demand for power, according to a white paper published by the state government last week.

The paper also noted that the MSEB had lost its commercial edge because of its social objectives""â€”that is, subsidies to various sections of society. More important, the paper warned that the board could face dire financial problems if it failed to undertake wide-ranging restructuring.

""If the current situation is allowed to continue, the investment requirements will increase further, leading to a declining quality of supply and reluctance on the part of the Centre and financial institutions to provide funding to the state,"" the paper said.

The paper said that peak demand for power will increase to 14,104 MW in 2011-12 from 9,893 MW in 2001-''02.

It added that about 48 per cent of the MSEB''s thermalgeneration network is between 15 years and 25 years old and another 15 per cent is older than 25 years.

The board also loses revenue due to huge transmission and distributionlossesâ€” estimated at about 39.40 per cent. According to the paper, the MSEB would need Rs 18,570 crore over the next ten years to reduce its technical losses, increase its transmission and distribution network, strengthen rural electrification and expand the high tension network.

The board''s revenues are another worrying aspect. Although the MSEB''s revenue has increased from Rs 323 crore in 1960-''61 to an estimated Rs 12,030 crore in 2001-''02, it has been incurring losses for the past few years.

Experts in the infrastructure sector point out that tariffs for domestic, powerloom and agricultural segments are lower than the average cost of supply of power.

The white paper has pointed out that consumption by high-paying industrial consumers â€”who, in turn, subsidise other usersâ€”has been on the decline, while consumption by subsided consumers has grown in the past few years. The low tariff for subsidised consumers has not only led to lower revenues, but also to sub-optimal consumption from these consumers, said the paper.

The MSEB''s arrears are Rs 7,114 crore, which is equivalent to seven months of its sales. An aggregate amount of Rs 5,226 crore has been outstanding for over a year, the paper has disclosed.

A vertically integrated MSEB, catering to the diverse needs of a customer base of 140 lakhs (and growing every year) has inherent limitations. The paper argues reorganising the electricity industry into vertically integrated monopolies is no longer necessary in view of technological advances.

""For the power sector in Maharashtra to be brought on the road to recovery, it is necessary for the various segments in the power business to be run by smaller, more manageable and commercially oriented entities,"" the white paper has said.

7,"Paswan calls for ousting Central, Bihar govts","MADHUBANI: Addressing a dharna organised in front of the collectorate by the Lok Janashakti Party (LJP) and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) to protest the inadequate relief to flood victims, the national president of LJP and former Union railway minister, Ram Vilas Paswan, gave a clarion call to oust both the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre and the Congress supported RJD government in the state.

While the government at the Centre is being remotely controlled by RSS forces as is evident from developments in Gujarat, the present government in the state has pushed Bihar into a cul-de-sac of backwardness, alleged Paswan.

He further said that the forces presently controlling the government at the Centre poses a serious threat to the very unity and integrity of the nation. However, the sinister design to split J&K into three states of J-K and Ladakh as a simplistic solution to the problem of terrorism, a demand frequently advocated by BJP and RSS fucntionaries, is explained, Paswan asked.

Claiming that his penchant for development, be it as the minister for railways or of communications or of coal, made him the eye-sore of many who are least interested in the politics of development, he said and added that the present government is pursuing an economic policy which will only ensure the country''s subjugation. Exhibiting a combative mood, Paswan demanded that the right to work, health and education be made fundamental rights. He also said that communal politics as practised by the BJP and the caste politics as practised by the RJD are eating into the vitals of our national fabric and added that the need of the hour was to follow a policy of uniting different sections of society by fostering a fellow feeling among them.

The national general secretary of NCP Jagannath Mishra came down heavily on the state government for its criminal neglect of the state in general and Mithilanchal in particular.

Accusing the state government of turning a blind eye to the sufferings of the people, Mishra demanded that the flood victims of the whole state including of Madhubani be provided adequate relief.

Mishra accused the Congress of beign no less responsible for the plight of Bihar and made fervent appeal to the people to recognise the significance of the social combination which is being tried to be achieved under the leadership of Ram Bilas Paswan by the LJP and NCP.

Later, a delegation comprising LJP and NCP functionaries handed over a charter of demands to the district administration. The dharna was presided by the district president of LJP, Kapileshwar Pandey.

9,Godhra incidents put us to shame: Pitroda,"AHMEDABAD: What happened in Gujarat (Godhra and its aftermath) has put all of us to shame, and has hurt the state, said the chairman and CEO of WorldTel, Sam Pitroda, here on Friday.

""It is a matter of shame that we have put ourselves in this position. Gujarat has suffered in the last few months and so has the pride of the people of Gujarat,"" he told a gathering of businessmen at the Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GCCI).

Speaking on the subject of, ''The road ahead for Gujarat'', Pitroda pointed out that Gujarat, a state of 45 million people, with a strong economy, was also the state that gave the world Gandhiji and his message of non-violence as a tool for social change.

""We need to recognise that to move forward, we need to reach out to our own people and need politicians who have the capacity to love everyone and build confidence. We can''t build a nation by fighting one another or with the kind of selfish values we have.""

He cautioned, ""In today''s era of globalisation, there is no time for petty issues. We have got to be on the top otherwise China, which is a real threat, or someone else will eat our lunch and we will have no one else to blame.""

He further said, ""The road ahead must begin with a change in the mind-set and concept of work so that we can have a strong economy. We need a new agenda and big ambitions not little ones. And to look at the road ahead we must fix the cracks in the system now and only then can we see the future,"" he said, adding ""the biggest problem is implementation as we are very poor at execution.

Earlier in the day, while addressing students of Nirma Institute of Management, Pitroda urged them to ""bite the bullet, attack basic problems and get things done now"".

""A country of a billion people should not be afraid of competition. We have to think smart and not take a narrow view of the world. If we decide to, we can take over the world,"" he said.

According to him, all our existing expertise in IT was geared towards solving the problems of the West. ""The best of our brains are out in the West. Software professionals are hung up on exports but not on solving our issues and problems. There are challenges at home that require IT.""

He pointed out that technology was a great tool to build a better world for all of us and e-governance, e-learning, e-transactions and e-health could revolutionise India.

10,Drop-out rate haunts govt,"HYDERABAD: Though government statistics show a drastic fall in the drop-out rate, school education department officials say children will come to school if infrastructure and quality of teachers at government schools is better than what it was now.

The fact that the schools need upgradation, both on material and men front was brought home to the government during the recent Chaduvula Panduga programme. One of the reasons why the programme did not yield the desired results, was lack of facilities in schools.

â€œThough we had about 30 per cent enrolment, we could have done much better if we had better infrastructure and facilities at schools,â€� a senior school education department official admitted. In the last five-years, from 1996-97, the drop-out rate in children of classes-I to V has come down from 50.97 per cent to 37.12 per cent in 2000-2001. The drop-out rate in the upper primary classes has come down from 65.08 per cent in 1996-97 to 56.43 per cent in 2000-2001.

â€œThe main reason for children dropping out of school is that they are children of migrant labour. The other reason is poverty and children made to work,â€� the official said. The only way to arrest drop-outs is to create awareness, he said.

The TRS on Friday produced denial letters to the media. A cross check by The Times of India confirmed that at least 15 of the 34 had retracted.

This has come as a shot in the arm for the TRS leadership. In a quick move, it condemned the group led by Innaiah for the confusion it had created in the party.

12,Advani-BSP deal for next Lok Sabha polls,"NEW DELHI: The BJP and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) have prepared a roadmap for their future relationship in Uttar Pradesh with a clear eye on the next Lok Sabha elections.

Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani is working out the nitty-gritty of this partnership, clearly upstaging Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee in this task.

Senior BJP leaders disclosed that the two parties had already worked out the details of their seat-sharing arrangement for the next polls with Advani having held lengthy discussions with Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mayawati.

The growing proximity between the BJP and BSP, and more particularly between Mayawati and Advani, was evident when the CM refused to issue a fresh notification in the Ayodhya case, effectively bailing out the Deputy PM for his role in the demolition of the Babri Masjid. BJP leaders said this decision had not come as a surprise to them, stating that â€˜â€˜nothing else was expectedâ€™â€™.

In addition, Mayawati has extended a special invitation to Advani to attend the September 28 BSP rally to be held in Lucknow, which is clearly Vajpayee territory. He is the only Central BJP leader to have been invited for the show, the others being state party leaders like Lalji Tandon and Vinay Katiyar.

Advaniâ€™s proximity to Mayawati is a clear departure from the recent past when the Deputy PM had actually resisted moves to form a coalition government with the BSP. BJP leader and former UP chief minister Rajnath Singh, who is still not comfortable with this partnership, was learnt to have prevailed upon Advani not to give his consent for a tie-up with the BSP.

Vajpayee, who always enjoyed a good rapport with Mayawati, had pushed hard for this pact and eventually persuaded the detractors in his party to agree to his proposal.

Admitting that BJP had worked out a long-term relationship with BSP in UP, party leaders said they were now making all efforts to see that relations between the two coalition partners were not impaired over the next two years. Party sources said both BJP and BSP had learnt from their past experience.

The BJP leadership, it was stated, had told Mayawati that she take the coalition partner into confdience before taking any major policy decision. Mayawati, on her part, also seems amenable to these suggestions, they said.

13,India may give assurance to Portuguese govt on Salem,"NEW DELHI: India may give an assurance to the Portuguese government that underworld don Abu Salem, detained in that country, would not be sentenced to death in a bid to secure his deportation, Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani said here on Friday night.

This was so as European countries were signatory to a convention which prohibited deportation of an accused to a country where he was likely to face death sentence, Advani told reporters.

""In this case, it is possible and Indian law permits that the necessary assurance may be given to the concerned government,"" he said.

He said that efforts were being made at diplomatic level to ensure Salem''s deportation to India.

14,State staff protest bonus cut,"KOLKATA: Armed with shoes, brooms and placards, Writersâ€™ Buildings employees owing allegiance to West Bengal Government Employeesâ€™ Union (Nabaparjay) raised slogans, marched through corridors and tried to storm the VIP enclosure.

They were protesting the state governmentâ€™s decision to slash by half the Puja bonus paid to its one million-odd employees.

Security personnel brought down the shutters to put the VIP enclosure out of bounds for the violent demonstrators. â€œBills for ministersâ€™ cars continue to sky-rocket.

But we are being victimised,â€� the agitated employees yelled.

Describing the state governmentâ€™s decision to pay Rs 1,000 as bonus as â€˜an insult to the employeesâ€™, Nabaparjay general secretary T. Chakraborty sought immediate scrapping of the decision and payment of bonus at 8.33 per cent and Rs 2,000 more as festival advance.

The state government had said on Thursday that it had become imperative to reduce bonus payment because of a severe cash crunch and had appealed to its employees to accept it without fuss. Initially reluctant to pay the bonus, the government had buckled under pressure from the CPM-dominated Coordination Committee and agreed to pay a nominal amount to employees. Coordination Committee leader

Pijush Sarkar decried the demonstration of Nabaparjay and described it as an attempt to gain cheap popularity. The government was passing through an acute financial crisis and its decision to pay bonus, though at a reduced rate,was welcome, he argued.

16,Five including two CPI(M) activists killed in J&K,"SRINAGAR: Stepping up attacks ahead of the second phase of assembly elections in Jammu and Kashmir, militants gunned down five persons including two CPI(M) activists in the valley since Friday night, official sources said on Saturday.

17,Bollywood mum on Salem's arrest,"NEW DELHI: There is one corner of the country where celebrations are unlikely to begin soon. Abu Salem may have been arrested, but the once-bitten film industry, plagued by threats from the underworld don, is treading warily.

The day after the news of the kingpin''s arrest in Portugal broke, industry bigwigs and veterans alike fought shy of commenting on the development, pointing out that there were many a slip between cup and lip.

While showman Subhash Ghai, who is said to have received extortion calls from Abu Salem, refused to even come on line for a comment, Lagaan director Ashutosh Gowarikar said: ""I don''t want to comment as I have not seen the news.""

The young director was least concerned that such an admission pointed to complete ignorance of the day''s headlines in every newspaper and television channel in the country.

Gowarikar did offer to speak ""in an hour''s time"" but was promptly unavailable on phone thereafter. Both Ghai and Gowarikar have been at the receiving end of extortion threats from underworld dons.

Earlier this year, police killed several members of an underworld gang, who were plotting the murder of Gowarikar and his Lagaan leading man Aamir Khan.

Veteran filmmaker J Om Prakash, who is also father-in-law to successful producer-director Rakesh Roshan, has a succinct explanation for Bollywood being tightlipped: ""I would not like to comment. I have never been threatened by Salem, but my family is affected. One does not know what will happen. He has slipped away once before because the government allowed him to. Let''s see what happens in Lisbon now.""

Rakesh Roshan had narrowly escaped a bid on his life by Salem''s men in 1999. Roshan was targeted for refusing to give the don a cut from his earnings after his film Kaho Naa Pyar Hai became a runaway success.

Clearly the film industry is loath to jump the gun before the Indian authorities have the mafia don safely in their net. What haunts them is the incident last year when ineffective diplomatic muscle allowed Salem to go scot-free despite an extradition treaty with UAE.

In October last, Abu Salem was reportedly arrested in Sharjah on the basis of an Interpol red corner alert which required member-countries to arrest him on sight. Within hours the news of his arrest had spread all over, but Salem was set free a mere 48 hours after his detention. The Indian authorities have since denied the incident; Bollywood clearly believes otherwise.

A film personality, requesting anonymity, said, ""Salem could manage to slip away even though India had a year-old extradition treaty with UAE. We have nothing of the sort with Portugal and the Indian authorities cannot do anything but seek his deportation. Everyone is afraid for his or her life. The film industry cannot be expected to say much at this stage. Nothing is clear.""

The tentacles of terror have spared few in the industry. Only in July this year, the Maharashtra government promised security to all film personalities whose lives were thought to be in danger after the release of the Sanjay Dutt tapes by the Mumbai Police.

Popular stars like Amitabh Bachchan, Shah Rukh Khan, Salman Khan, Hrithik Roshan and Govinda are also reported to be targets of the underworld extortion threats. It was the killing of music magnate Gulshan Kumar in broad daylight in 1997 that first jolted Bollywood with the realisation that the underworld meant business. Salem is an accused in Kumar''s murder.

Tinsel town may not be talking openly about it, but the hurried whispers have begun within the industry. ""This is all that will be discussed over the weekend,"" an industry insider predicted.",NEW DELHI
18,10 injured in militant attack on Cong rally,"SRINAGAR: At least ten persons were injured when militants attacked a Congress rally in Anantnag district of south Kashmir on Saturday, police said.

However, a Congress spokesman said the grenade was lobbed by militants on the motorcade of party candidate Peerzada Mohammad Sayeed around 1430 hours which missed the target and exploded on the roadside.

The incident took place when the Congress leader was returning after the rally, the spokesman said, adding no Congress activist was injured in the attack.

The vehicle which was hit by the grenade suffered slight damages. The grenade after hitting the vehicle rebounded and exploded on the road injuring pedestrains, the spokesman said.

20,Over 30 injured in mob-police clash in Jaipur,"JAIPUR: Over 30 people, including 20 policemen, were injured when agitated upper caste people clashed with police and in the subsequent firing following Dalits'' plan to enter a temple which was thwarted by the upper castes'' protest in Jaipur district on Saturday, an official spokesman said.

The injured included a superintendent of police, he said.

About 2000 Dalits took out a march from Chaksu town to Chakwara village in Phagi tehsil, about 40 km from here, protesting against the alleged denial of their entry into a temple pond and wanted to make a forcible entry, the spokesman said.

21,Lack of procurement adds to the woes of farmers,"BATHINDA: While the hailstorm accompanied by torrential rain, on Wednesday, caused widespread loss to the paddy and cotton crop in Bathinda, Faridkot, Moga districts and adjoining areas, the absence of any procuring agencies in the mandis has further added to the woes of hundreds of farmers across the area.

A visit to various mandis of the area by the Times News Network team, on Thursday, pointed out that though the paddy crop had already started reaching the mandis but there was no procuring agency to buy the crop while rain water was stagnating in the produce lying at the mandis.

""First we suffer disaster of drought, now of torrential rains. It appears God is annoyed with us,â€� said Tarlok Singh, a farmer.

""It is not only nature which is playing truant on us, the government too is not solving our problems.

I am amazed to learn that the government agencies have no plan of starting procurement for the next 12 days,â€� he added.

Given the arrival pattern of paddy in mandis of the area, FCIs programme of starting the procurement from October 1 and the prevailing inclement weather condition, the farmers feel that this would further worsen their economic condition. ""If the same situation prevailed for another three-four days, the farmers would be forced to make distress sale of paddy to the private traders,â€� said Nachhatar Singh of Ghuda village.

In some pockets of the area, the farmers are working in haste to harvest the crop due to the unpredictable weather. According to agriculture department sources, the rain and hailstorm on Wednesday caused maximum loss in Nathana block of Bathinda.

The worst-affected villages were Ganga, Nath Pura, Kalyan Sukh, Burj Dhala and Gidder.

Besides paddy, the late monsoon rain would cause great loss to cotton crop too. Sources said that with an increase in moisture content in atmosphere, the conditions are now more congenial for American Bollworm to attack the crop.

22,Salem blamed for Vadodara violence,"VADODARA: Even as an uneasy calm prevailed on Saturday, police commissioner DD Tuteja sought to deflect attention from the possible intelligence failure that led to the violence and four deaths.

""We have reports that the arrest of underworld don Abu Salem had been widely discussed in a particular community. There''s a possibility that this led to the trouble in the city on Friday,"" the police commissioner said.

Meanwhile, 108 people have been arrested in the aftermath of the riots. Despite the violence that continued late into the night on Friday, Ganpati idols were immersed with fanfare in the Sursagar Lake till around 12.30 am. No incidents of stone-pelting or rioting were reported after midnight.

While three died on Friday evening, another person, allegedly lynched by a mob, succumbed to injuries later. As many as 26 people were injured. Police officials said 41 rounds were fired at various trouble spots to control the mobs.

Tension was palpable in the Walled City areas where most of the shops remained closed till late on Saturday. The funeral procession of two riot victims in the area added to the tension.

Residents of Fatepura area claimed a mosque was vandalised by rioters. Police also recovered three pipe bombs from the Yakutpura area.

The police, meanwhile, decided against imposing curfew in the city despite the rioting on Friday. Said joint commissioner of police P C Thakur, ""Imposing curfew is not possible logistically as there are several Ganpati processions on. There will be confusion if curfew is imposed when immersion ceremonies are in progress.""

That was about a fortnight ago. But even on the weekend, Patel told TNN, ""I do not know what has happened. I can only request. I can''t do anything more. The file to transfer the transport commissioner, I am told, is awaiting a final clearance from the CM. It must be lying there even now.

An influential Kadva Patel leader from North Gujarat, belonging to Unjha, (a BJP seat that the CM is eyeing as one of the options), the minister added, ""I had been to Delhi and returned on Friday evening. I will again meet the CM on Monday, as he is busy with the Gaurav Yatra. I have done my job. I had formally asked chief secretary G Subba Rao to unseat the transport commissioner.""

Patel''s worry does not stop here. A BJP insider said, Patel, who is also chairman of Asia''s biggest marketing yard at Unjha, has ""no work"" nowadays. The Gujarat State Road Transport Corporation, popularly called ST, is chaired by senior BJP MLA Kamlesh Patel from Maninagar, who allows no interference in his domain. Now the transport commissioner, too, does not listen.

Already, there is a general feeling of resentment among the state IAS officers over the manner in which Patel is trying to oust Tiwari. Tiwari''s immediate boss, principal secretary (transport) Sudha Anchalia, has gone on a two-month long leave. Her colleagues say, she is ""unwilling to work under a minister who is so headstrong and wants to interfere into the day-to-day working of IAS officers.""

""Tiwari''s mistake was that despite the minister''s interference, he exercised his power in giving additional charge to two upright RTO inspectors - D R Chudasma and R B Panchal - to look after the major checkposts in South and North Gujarat"", said a senior bureaucrat. ""This led to a flutter among lower officials at checkposts, where corruption rules the roost. They organised a ministerial intervention and the minister responded,"" he added.

Patel has been trying hard to take away the additional charge given to the two RTO inspectors. Yet all his effort to institute an inquiry into how the ""administrative mess"" in his department took place has failed. He complained to TNN, ""I asked Varesh Sinha, who is acting transport secretary, to look into the matter. But Sinha tells me it can be done only by the transport commissioner. I am back to square one - Tiwari should be removed.""

Comments a senior bureaucrat, ""The IAS officers cannot hope to take decisions purely on the whims of the ministers, particularly now, when the elections are round the corner and the BJP may not come to power. There is still no legal clarity on what a caretaker government can do and what it can''t. Indeed, even the chief secretary will tread carefully.""

After all, bureaucrats know, Tiwari is on a stronger footing. The income from the RTO checkposts, which had drastically dipped in June and July, have gone up drastically in August and September, thanks to the ""new initiative"" taken by Tiwari to root out corruption along the checkposts by posting two upright RTO inspectors to ""oversee"" arrangements in North and South of Gujarat.

Between September 1 and 20, the total income from motor vehicle tax went up to Rs 46.86 crore, from Rs 37.11 crore in August during the same period. These were between Rs 18-20 crore per month from May to July.

The checkpost income during September 1 and 20 was Rs 13.75 crore, compared to Rs 12.85 crore during the same period last year. ""This shows that our arrangement is working,"" said Tiwari, when contacted.

24,Students protest VTU attendance rules,"BANGALORE: Hundreds of R V College of Engineering students staged a protest in front of the Visvesvaraya Technological University regional office on Saturday against the new rules increasing minimum attendance to 85 per cent and the college hours.

This comes a couple of days after M S Ramaiah Institute of Technology students launched a signature campaign against the rules.

The students urged the university to revoke the rules with immediate effect. ``Making 85 per cent attendance compulsory is too harsh. Besides, the new college timings, from 9 am to 4 pm, leave us with no time for other activities,'''' students complained.

VTU Regional Officer Jayaprakash said 85 per cent minimum attendance rule is applicable to I and II semester students only. As regards the 9 am to 4 pm rule, he said the timings were extended to facilitate better interaction between students and the faculty. ``The rule will be examined and colleges informed about any change,'''' he added.

Later, students told the Sunday Times of India that it was very strenous to attend classes from 9 am to 4 pm. ``We have virtually no time for sports, entertainment or cultural activities. Students are not free on Saturdays also. Besides, there is no time for preparing for any competitive examinations or higher studies abroad,'''' they said and added that the old system provided for a five day week including two full days and three half days.

When contacted, Jayaprakash said the 9 am to 4 pm rule was being reexamined. The 85 per cent rule was applicable only to first and second semesters, he clarified.

25,Liquor can flow but the party can’t swing,"NEW DELHI: The Delhi state governmentâ€™s tall claims on making the city a â€˜tipplerâ€™s paradiseâ€™ fall flat if one goes by the archaic guidelines in the excise rule book.

Sample this â€” the excise rules in Delhi allow liquor bars in restaurants, but put restrictions on keeping bar-stools next to the bar counter. All possible liquor brands available in the market can be served at Delhiâ€™s 121 bar-cum restaurants, but only if they are not displayed on the shelves.

When it comes to restrictions, the excise department believes in making a song-and-dance. You can drink to your heartâ€™s content, but dare you shake a leg. Apparently, dancing and singing are prohibited in bars.

Ask any excise department official why these rules are there, and they grope for explanations. â€˜â€˜These rules are archaic and need to be changed,â€™â€™ says state finance minister Mahinder Singh Saathi, who also heads the excise department.

But with all its tall claims about bringing Delhi at par with the more liberal liquor markets like Mumbai and Bangalore, the excise department is still not ready to give up these seemingly illogical rules.

For instance, a proposal to allow professional musicians in restaurant-cum-bars was mooted, but was rejected on â€˜moral groundsâ€™. â€˜â€˜We do not want to encourage dancing bars like in Mumbai. These bars may turn into cabaret shows,â€™â€™ an excise official expressed his apprehension.

Despite the tomtomming on liberalising liquor trade in Delhi, the state governmentâ€™s new excise policy 2002-2003 has turned out to be all fizz.

Having uncorked some high-spirited proposals like privatisation of liquor vends, sale of beer at local department stores and allowing home delivery of beer and wine, the state excise department has not been able to pull them off very far.

The usual drill to distribute licence has hit a snag with only 12 out of the 514 applicants for private vends meeting the eligibility criteria. The department is now contemplating inviting fresh applications. Under the new policy, the government planned to allow about 70 private liquor vends in Delhi.

But even before the policy could be implemented, the government has rolled backed some major decisions it took under the new policy. The decision to allow delivery of beer and wine at the customerâ€™s doorstep has been shelved.

â€˜â€˜The proposal was a bit, too, ambitious. For a city where liquor is distributed in most sarkari fashion by state-run corporations, the suggestion to allow home delivery of beer was a little far-fetched,â€™â€™ a state excise department official conceded.

Saathi added: â€˜â€˜There were apprehensions that children would place orders for alcohol through emails and fax. Since there was no way of ensuring that beer would be delivered to the right person, we decided to drop the proposal.â€™â€™

The departmentâ€™s proposal to allow restaurants to serve liquor till midnight was also not taken beyond the conceptual stage. At present, the state excise department charges 50 per cent of the total L4 licence fee over and above the annual licence fees from restaurants serving liquor till 12 am.

The excise departmentâ€™s decision to give the existing 240-odd state corporation liquor shops a new look has also come a cropper.

The departmentâ€™s warning to the three corporations â€” Delhi State Industrial Development Corporation (DSIDC), Delhi Transport and Tourism Development Corporation, Delhi Civil Supplies Corporation â€” to â€˜â€˜improve or close downâ€™â€™ has failed to yield results.

â€˜â€˜Despite all hullabaloo, the liquor shops still don the run-down look. Good brands continue to be elusive. Attendants are still rude,â€™â€™ complained Rajeev Singh, a doctor.

26,Another policeman turns robber; arrested,"BANGALORE: After Assistant Commissioner of Police Belliappa, who has remained elusive after reportedly robbing Rs 19.26 lakh from a Kerala jeweller, it''s the turn of a reserve sub-inspector to be brought to book.

RSI Krishnappa, who worked as the head of the escort party of two successive police commissioners in the past, was arrested by the Jagjeevanram Nagar police here on Saturday. He has been accused of cheating 41 police families of Rs 30 lakh in the name of an illegal chit fund. He has been placed under suspension.

Krishnappa is a resident of police quarters located near the City Armed Reserve Headquarters on Mysore Road. He ran a chit fund business to which the wives of 41 policemen deposited Rs 70,000 each with him.

Instead of returning their money with interest, he was dodging paying the amount. The depositors complained to the jurisdictional police about Krishnappa. When they failed to take action against him, they approached Police Commissioner H.T. Sangliana on Saturday.

Following this, Krishnappa was arrested. The police seized a Maruti van, a scooter and a motorcycle from his premises. ""He was about to `emulate'' the elusive ACP Belliappa. We caught him before he went into hiding,"" DCP (West) G.B. Chebbi said.

Sangliana said he was finalising the report recommending Belliappa''s dismissal from the service. ``We are making persistent efforts to nab him,'''' he added.

27,Kabini farmers to form suicide squads,"MYSORE: Emboldened by the suicidal step taken by Guruswamy, farmer leaders of the Kabini ayacut area have drawn up militant plans. On Saturday, they decided to intensify their struggle and form ""martyrs'' squads"" to prevent the release of water to Tamil Nadu in future.

Disclosing this at a press conference here, Mallesh and Kurubur Shantkumar said Guruswamy''s sacrifice was just the ""tip of the iceberg"". Farmers of Kabini ayacut area are ready to sacrifice their lives for the sake of water, they said.

""We will form teams of 100 farmers from each taluk of Kabini ayacut area, who will be ready to leap into the river in batches to prevent the government from releasing water to Tamil Nadu,"" Mallesh said.

In future, whenever the Samiti launches an agitation against the state and central governments against injustice caused to farmers, members of these squads would jump into the river waters. They would also jump off selected buildings such as Vidhana Soudha, Chief Minister Krishna''s residence and other important government structures, he warned.

The farmers are determined and have resolved to take on the state force, he warned.

It was apparently triggered after some miscrents wrote objectionable words on the wall of a place of worship belonging to a community at Tilakwadi.

Youths belonging to a perticular community looted and set ablaze to two shops belonging to the other community. They forcibly closed shops and business establishments at Tilakwadi, Angol, Hindwadi, Udambag and the surrounding areas of Tilakwadi. Then they started pelting stones on the shops and vehicles moving on the roads.

The mob beat up shop owner Kiran Sainak, former corporator of Belgaum City Corporation and pelted stones on his shop when he refused to close his shop.

As soon as news of violence spread, youths belonging to another community gatered and started pelting stones on the shops belonging to the former. As many as three shops - a fruit shop, photo frame works shop and a canteen were set ablaze.

Six mini buses and a Maruti Esteen car were pelted with stones at Hindalga. The situation in Tilakwadi, Angol, Udambag, Hindwadi and the surrounding areas of Tilakwadi was tense.

Police beefed up security, and rounded up some youths belonging to both the communities.

A gang of 8 to 10 persons attacked a student with the swords when he was on his way to city bus stand to return his house. He was admitted to hospital.

30,BJP-ruled wards are less literate: Survey,"LUCKNOW: Who is the most read of them all ? With minute details of the Census-2001 finally vetted and catalogued, the picture of the literacy rate of the city, also the parliamentary constituency of Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee, has thrown up some interesting facts.

According to the findings of the Census report which enumerates the literacy rates of all the 110 wards of the state capital, Indiranagar comes out with flying colours as the area represented by most literate people â€” 93.66 per cent of the total population of 20,959.

The ward also tops the charts with the highest number of male and female literate population clocking 96.31 and 90.78 per cent. Lohia Nagar comes a close second with the literacy rate of 91.72 per cent while the Sardar Patel Nagar has had to be content with the third slot having notched up 90.32 per cent as literates. The Shaheed Bhagat Singh ward fares badly in contrast with a paltry 49.91 per cent literate.

The findings also show that there are more literate men (82.23 per cent) in the city than women (72.68 per cent). A total of 8,47,041 men out of the total 11,65,932 are literate as against 6,67,786 women out of their total population of 10,41,408.

Incidentally, the study sheds light on the fact that most of the wards which are ruled by the BJP have lagged behind on the literacy front. Even the area under the urban development minister Lalji Tandon â€” Chowk â€” fares â€˜not-too-goodâ€™ and is placed at No 11 with a literacy rate of 87.65 per cent.

The population (22,7,340) under the Nagar Nigam area is slightly better placed at 77.73 per cent while in the whole district it is 69.39 per cent.

The wardwise literacy rate is: Gomtinagar 89.64 percent, Ganeshganj 88.64, Mahanagar 86.90, Rajajipuram 85.36, Aliganj 84.31, Niralanagar 83.88, Aminabad 84.04, Maulviganj 77.67, Asharfabad 77.15, Aishbagh 74.30, Daliganj 72.42, Chinhat 66.09, Saadatganj 65.51, Balaganj 55.53 and Garhi Peer Khan 53.88 per cent.

31,Ragging incident probe complete,"LUCKNOW: The four-member committee headed by director, technical education, probing the ragging incident of the Institute of Engineering and Technology, completed recording of statements of students and teachers on Friday.

However, doors were shut for mediapersons as none from the committee or IET officers divulged about the findings of the probe done so far. The committee will submit its report to the government.

Sources, however, said that while junior students did admit about blatant ragging on the campus, none could give a clue on the incident which forced Anup Kapoor, BTech I student, to commit suicide. Statements of Anupâ€™s family members were recorded in Kanpur by the members earlier this week. Later, during its last three days stay in Lucknow, the committee interrogated each and every student, teacher and staff, present in the college.

Inquiry committee members skirted queries whether the probe included the disclosures made by the Kanpur police about involvement of a final year student. IET officials reiterated their stance that they had not received any communication from Kanpur police and, thus, had no basis to take action against the said students. However, officers said that they were considering to constitute a system where junior students could report about ragging incidents without revealing their identity.

32,Slain ex-minister’s son missing,"LUCKNOW: Son of a slain former cabinet minister in the Congress regime was reported missing under mysterious circumstances from his Jiyamau residence in Hazratganj since Friday evening.

The fact that the missing man was the complainant of the murder of his father, has added the possibility of some foul play.

Reports said that Vijay Kumar Yadav, son of slain Congress leader Laxmi Shanker Yadav, left his Jiyamau residence around 7 pm on Friday telling his wife Kumkum Yadav that he would be back in an hour. However, when he did not return till around midnight, his wife contacted his friends and other possible locations where he could have gone but to no avail.

Owner of an Inter college in Khutan area of Jaunpur district, 40-year-old Vijay Kumar was allocated a police shadow, Mahendra, whom he sent off home around 6 pm on Friday as, by that time, he had no plans of going out of the house, the police said. He was untraceable ever since. After the FIR was lodged, senior police officials visited the house of the victim to collect further details. Police said that there was no factor, till Saturday evening, to suggest that there could be anything more to the incident.

However, the disturbing factor for the police was the fact that Vijayâ€™s father Laxmi Shanker Yadav was shot dead in 1999 and in the FIR lodged in connection with the incident, the missing victim was the complainant and the eye-witness as well. In the FIR, former MLA and now an Apna Dal leader Angad Yadav, slain dons Suraj Pal and Chandra Pal were named as accused along with Ramesh Kaliya.

While Angad is on bail, Kaliya is still in jail. Suraj Pal and Chandra Pal were killed in separate police encounters, police said.
