0,Exit polls don't affect TDP mood,"HYDERABAD: Undaunted by the exit poll results beamed by private television channels, the Telugu Desam Party leaders on Monday preferred to go by their own survey reports and began celebrations by distributing sweets and bursting fire crackers at the party office.

Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu had been monitoring the situation since morning and was getting a feedback from the survey agencies it had commissioned, every half an hour from the field.

The Telugu Desam Party had deployed two agencies for conducting the exit polls in addition to the information from the intelligence wing of the police department. Following reports about the heavy turnout of voters by afternoon and the initial information from survey agencies favouring the Telugu Desam Party, a jubilant Naidu reportedly appeared confident saying: â€œWe will come back to power.â€� The exit polls conducted by the party claim that the Telugu Desam Party would get over 100 Assembly seats and bag 14 Lok Sabha segments in the second phase, which has 147 Assembly and 21 Lok Sabha constituencies.

But party leaders feel that it might face some trouble in Anantapur and Guntur districts and concede some seats to the Congress.

The agency which conducted the exit polls for the TDP had taken samples from all polling stations. Important party functionaries met Naidu at his residence in the evening and had a detailed discussion about the polling trends.

The party leaders say that the exit polls conducted by the television channels lacked scientific approach and contend that they had gone wrong in three states which went to polls in the past.

1,Congress upbeat after exit polls,"AHMEDABAD: The exit polls after the second phase of polling on Monday saw the Gujarat Congress very upbeat. Predictions of a hung Parliament had most of the Congress leaders already looking at possibilities of forming a government.

Congress spokesperson Hasmukh Patel said, ""The trend will get even more favourable for the Congress in the next two phases."" According to Patel, the NDA would not get more than 225 seats, and the Congress and its alliances will be in a better position to stake claim to form the government. ""Even the Gujarat results will be shocking for the BJP."" Patel was confident that going by the trend, the Congress would secure upto 200 seats.

Congress spokesperson Shaktisinh Gohil said, ""This is an indicator of how the people have rejected the BJPNDAâ€™s feel-good factor."" Gohil added that the â€˜managedâ€™ prepoll surveys had predicted that the NDA would secure upto 330 seats, but the exit polls now show that the trend has changed and the Congress is heading towards forming a government.

Said Gohil, ""Also, our alliance partners are faithful, while the BJPâ€™s partners are power-hungry."" Former MLA Siddharth Patel said, ""The NDA is unlikely to secure a clear majority, and two more phases of polling are still to come. If this trend continues, the Congress will surely be able to form a government.""

Former deputy chief minister Narhari Amin, agreeing with Patel, said, ""We have been saying since long that the BJP-led NDA will not get more than 250 seats."" Sounding absolutely sure of ousting the NDA, Amin said, ""Today even Mayawati and Mulayam Singh Yadav are not ready to form a government with the BJP. So the chances of a Congress-alliance government are greater.""

Ex-CM Shankersinh Vaghela reiterated his optimism he showed at public rallies, but added that ""exit polls have a very limited sample-size which cannot reflect the real situation. They can in fact influence the polls"".

""Instead of asking people about who they voted for, in a secret ballot, they should ask them about which issues concern them most,"" he said.

2,Police arrest gang of vehicle lifters,"AHMEDABAD: A gang of five was arrested on charges of vehicle lifting on Saturday.

The youths, said crime branch men, were part of an inter-state gang that stole cars and two-wheelers from western parts of the city for illegal sale.

In all, 13 cases of vehicle thefts of two and four wheelers have been detected with the arrest of the gang. All the thefts had occurred in areas like Satellite, Navrangpura, Maninagar and Amraiwadi. The police said the inter-state gang has committed many other crimes like contract killing and loot.

Crime branch officers nabbed the accused by organising a stake out near Moni Hotel in Narol. After a long wait, five youths aged between 21 and 25 years â€” Mukesh Rajput and Vishal Soni of Isanpur, Kapur Bhadoria of Vatva, Pratapsinh Rajput alias Shital and Sanjay Bhadoria of Amraiwadi â€” reached the spot in a Tata Sumo, that the police verified was a stolen vehicle.

After being detained and questioned at Gaekwad Haveli, they did confess to their crime. Mukesh (21) is the gang leader and used to mastermind all thefts they committed in the city in the past one year.

Two Maruti 800, one Tata Sumo, one Maruti van were recovered from them. The list of â€˜liftedâ€™ two-wheelers include five Hero Honda Splendor bikes, two Yamaha bikes and two scooters. Procedure to recover the stolen vehicles has been initiated, said the crime branch.

During initial rounds interrogation the culprits have allegedly told the police that after zeroing in on the target they used duplicate keys to steal the vehicles. These vehicles, which did not have legal documents certifying ownership, were then sold to gullible customers and also to friends at nominal rates.

The police, however, told TNN that these arrests could hardly make any dent in the massive vehicle thefts reported in western parts of the city. They surmise that more than one organised gang of vehicle lifters is active in this city.

""Vehicles after being stolen in Ahmedabad are often sold off in neighbouring states or even in other parts of Gujarat. Rajasthan is a major ''resale'' centre for stolen vehicles,"" said a police officer.

3,Pratim in new role as BJP 'minister',"KOLKATA: Love in the times of elections. A young CPM activist falls desperately in love with the daughter of a hard core Trinamul supporter.

Both families fiercely oppose the match, and a quirky ""BJP leader"" makes things even difficult for the lovers. The pair finally elopes to a politics free world. The drama played out in front of Kalighat temple on Monday. But hold that neighbourhood gossip yet. This was a real street play, with real actors, one of whom was fire services minister Pratim Chatterjee.

The senior Forward Bloc leader plays â€” believe it or not â€” the role of a BJP leader. No stranger to grease paint, Chatterjee claims to be the first minister in the country to ""educate the masses"" through the medium of street play.

Well, one may not be sure of the record but it certainly is a unique move in electioneering in West Bengal. Chatterjee, who has been on stage before and also features in an upcoming Bengali film, said the exercise was aimed at ""exposing the weaknesses of political parties in the election fray"".

""This should not be seen as an election campaign for any of our Left Front partners since the skit does not eulogise any party... It is just a satire on the dark side of politics,"" Chatterjee said. The minister''s statement notwithstanding, it''s a fact that the half- hour satire â€” a real rib-tickler, one must say â€” uses the mass medium to lampoon what it calls the ""BJP''s communal agenda and the Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee''s gimmick of austerity"".

The setting was apt, too carefully chosen to be a mere coincidence.

Chatterjee played out his four- minute cameo in front of Kalighat, close to Mamata Banerjee''s Harish Chatterjee Street home, in the heart of Kolkata South Lok Sabha constituency, from where the Trinamul chief is seeking re-election.

The ""feel good"" slogan of the NDA government came in for severe criticism, as did the controversial ""India shining"" campaign in the play put together by veteran theatre personality Chandan Sen. Chatterjee''s character, in particular, tore the BJP propaganda to shreds.

4,'Very peaceful' polls: Chief secy,"PATNA: The polling in Bihar''s 17 parliamentary constituencies during the second phase on Monday witnessed two killings and injury to 11 persons. In two separate incidents, police opened fire to disperse unruly mobs. Incidents of group clash was also reported from two places. Besides, Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) were damaged at 10 booths, including five in hyper-sensitive Siwan. The police arrested 191 persons for disturbing poll process.

""Reports of EVM failure initially poured in from some places. However, the EVMs were rectified later on,"" deputy chief electoral officer S H Minto said.

Minto said that reports of an FIR against JD(U) candidate Prabhunath Singh for smashing EVMs was also found to be incorrect.

Special observer deputed by the Election Commission for the Chhapra seat L V Saptarishi ordered BJP MLA Dilip Verma and RJD MLC Subhash Yadav (chief minister Rabri Devi''s brother) to leave the constituency, where RJD supremo Laloo Prasad Yadav and Union minister Rajiv Pratap Rudy have locked horns. The seat being a prestigious one, BJP and RJD legislators were camping there. Laloo and Rudy, too, were present, but they avoided mediapersons, reports said.

Minto, however, expressed ignorance about any order issued by the Chhapra DM asking RJD MLC Subhash Yadav to get out of the constituency.

One Sudarshan Singh (60) was beaten to death with lathi blows about 300 yards outside the booth number 47 of Kohra Mathia in the Parsa assembly segment of the Chhapra constituency while Praveen Kumar (20) sustained serious bullet injuries in Maker village of the same assembly segment and was rushed to Hajipur hospital for treatment, where he died.

Overall, the police recovered a double-barrelled gun, a regular gun, a pistol and a countrymade pistol. The recoveries included 60 cartridges of gun and 25 of revolver. Three cars, 20 motorcycles and two Tata Sumos were also seized. Voters boycotted polls at four booths to protest lack of development.

Chief secretary K A H Subramanian said the average polling recorded was between 50 and 55 per cent and qualified it as ""very peaceful"". He added that both Siwan and Chhapra had never seen peaceful polling in the past. ""The repolling will be ordered in those booths where EVM machines were damaged or did not work in the 17 constituencies,"" he said.

State DGP Narain Mishra said that the police headquarters, on the basis of information received, apprehended that Maoists from Nepal could vitiate the poll in the constituencies close to the Nepal border. ""But no Maoists, no extremists figured,"" Mishra said.

Mishra denied that junior minister Udit Rai was pelted with stones by a mob in Nawadih village under Jalalpur segment of the Chhapra constituency. The police resorted to firing there to disperse an irate mob, but no one was injured.

In another incident, police fired nine rounds in Bishanpur village in Kanti segment of the Muzaffarpur seat to disperse an agitated mob involved in group clash. Bombs were blasted outside two booths, one each in Chhapra and Motihari constituencies.

The police headquarters particularly heaved a sigh of relief in view of the ""peaceful poll"". IG (headquarters) Neelmani said during 1999 parliamentary polls, 20 people, including four in the first phase, 15 in the second phase and one in the third phase, were killed.

5,Gujarat riots off radar in polls for Shahnawaz,"KISHANGANJ: Union textile minister and BJP nominee from Kishanganj Shahnawaz Hussain rapped on the knuckles all those who raked up the Gujarat riots in their poll campaign but deliberately forgot Bhagalpur and such other riots and said they did all this with the ulterior motive of fomenting communal hatred to garner support.

Hussain, addressing a news conference here on Monday, asked all those why they never raised hackles against the prime accused in Bairgachhi riots in this constituency who happened to be the son of RJD candidate Taslimuddin.

Rubbishing the allegations that BJP was a communal party and anti-Muslim, the BJP heavyweight said his party never used the Muslims as mere vote-bank and had done much for the welfare and well-being of the Muslims than any other party.

Hussain extended warm welcome to nearly a dozen Muslim leaders like Haider Naushad, former district chief of RJD who on Monday joined the BJP and committed themselves to work for the success of BJP nominee.

6,"Countermand polls in Parsa, pleads NDA","PATNA: The Election Commission (EC) has connived with the state administration and RJD to ensure the victory of RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav from Chhapra parliamentary constituency, alleged the NDA here on Monday.

""It is a case of benign connivance to ensure the victory of Laloo from Chapra"", state convenor of NDA election campaign committee and Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said, while addressing a Press conference at the BJP headquarters here.

Prasad charged the EC with doing nothing to stop rigging and booth capturing by RJD leaders, ministers of Rabri Devi cabinet and legisalators in Chhapra and other constituencies with the help of notorious criminals, though the NDA had alerted chief election commissioner (CEC), chief electoral officers (CEOs), Bihar, special observer EC, Bihar about it in advance.

He said that 600 electronic voting machines (EVMs) of Sheohar, Motihari, Madhubani and Bettiah failed to function when the poll began.

Convenor of BJP''s election campaign management committee Chandra Mohan Roy said that thousands of voters of Bagaha could not exercise their franchise as local administration failed to provide protection to them despite the poll boycott call given by MCC.

Roy alleged that junior minister Vijay Gupta had captured booth in Bettiah. Chief whip of BJP legislature party in state assembly Navin Kishore Prasad Sinha said that miscreants made an abortive bid to set afire a car carrying BJP nominee from Madhubani Hukumdev Narayan Yadav near Aunsi zero mile on monday. Yadav escaped unhurt, Sinha said.

Prasad said that failure of EC to prevent rigging in Chhapra and other 16 constituencies by RJD had made it clear that it had failed to keep its promise to ensure free and impartial poll. Chhapra was a case to test EC''s commitment to hold free and fair poll in Bihar but it failed miserably in its effort, Prasad maintained.

NDA also demanded countermanding of election in Parsa assembly segment of Chhapra constituency, besides re-polling at over 200 polling stations in the remaining five assembly segments of the constituency.

Prasad alleged that state science and technology minister Chandrika Rai, junior urban development minister Udit Rai, his brother and son and RJD legislators Subhash Yadav, Anwar Ahmad and Ram Das Rai indulged in largescale rigging and booth capturing with the help of local administration and goons like Sunil Rai.

Deployment of central forces was inadequate, Prasad said adding although the EC had announced that DMs would deploy central para-military forces in consultation with Election Commission observers nothing of that sort happened and local DMs and SPs deployed forces taking into account interest of the Rashtriya Janata Dal.

7,Jaswant's son violated visa rules: Cong,"NEW DELHI: The Congress on Monday alleged that the government''s policy on visas to Pakistan, as laid down in the wake of the Kargil conflict by then external affairs minister Jaswant Singh, was being grossly violated by his son Manvendra Singh, BJP''s candidate from Barmer.

The party demanded a probe into reports that visas had been issued to scores of Indians living in the border districts of Rajasthan to visit Pakistan on the recommendations of local BJP leaders, particularly Manvendra Singh.

""This reflects the issuing of visas to Indian citizens on a discriminatory and selective basis, rooted in political influence rather than normal rules and regulations,"" party leader and former foreign secretary J N Dixit said.

He said on receiving reports that visas were being issued solely on the basis of political recommendations, the AICC conducted inquiries with the Pakistan High Commission which said they had to take note of recommendations made by people ""whose influence required a response"".

Dixit said when the present envoy Shiv Shankar Menon suggested to the Pakistan government that applicants hailing from UP and Bihar, be given visa through a special camp.

8,Sporadic violence rocks Phase II,"NEW DELHI: The second phase of polling passed off peacefully in Jammu and Kashmir. Police foiled an attempt by militants to explode a bomb near a polling booth at Zadibal in Srinagar parliamentary constituency.

In Pallam village of East Godavari district in AP, a TDP activist was fatally stabbed allegedly by Congress activists near a polling booth.

9,SC refuses to ban exit polls,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday refused to stop opinion and exit polls even as it issued notices to the Centre, Election Commission and Press Council of India on a matter which thrusts itself to the centrestage every time during polls.

A Bench headed by Justice S Rajendra Babu, who will succeed Chief Justice V N Khare on May 2, also issued notices to certain TV news channels telecasting opinion and exit polls on attorney-general Soli J Sorabjee''s request that the news channels should also be impleaded as necessary parties in this matter.

The apex court was hearing a PIL in which the petitioner, D K Thakur, has sought a ban on such polls till the last phase of polling was over on May 10. Thakur''s counsel P P Rao sought early hearing of the matter but Justice Babu said, ""It would not be possible for these elections.""

Though not a party to the PIL, the Congress and Left have backed the demand for a ban on exit polls on the ground that they mark an interference with the poll process.

Counsel for the petitioner argued that the issue raised in the PIL was of vital importance and needed to be heard and decided as it affected the functioning of the democracy, which was a part of the basic structure of the Constitution.

Sorabjee has already advised the Centre against promulgating an ordinance to curb such polls. Sorabjee said such a ban would violate the citizens'' fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression guaranteed under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution.

But Rao said the rights under Article 19(1) have some inherent limitations. The Election Commission has been given the power under Article 324 for the free and fair conduct of elections.

Both these provisions have to be read together. In a country like India where elections were held in several phases, dissemination of opinion and exit poll results before the completion of the final phase of polling affected the mental makeup of the electorate, Rao said.

Rao said most of the pollsters had predicted a victory for the Congress which proved to be wrong.

10,Lone incident mars Khed poll,"KHED: Former Ranji player Ashok Mohol must have realised that predicting the outcome of a cricket match is easier than foretelling the result of his Lok Sabha â€˜battleâ€™.

Polling in Khed â€” one of the largest constituencies, geographically and electorate-wise â€” was otherwise peaceful, barring a stray incident. Voting was slow in the morning, but gathered pace as the day progressed.

An estimated 50 per cent of the 10.6 lakh voters exercised their franchise on Monday.

Stretching from Malshej Ghat (near Nasik) in the north to Varandha Ghat near Bhor) in the south, a distance of approximately 200 km, the constituency is practically difficult to cover in a day. And this has been the main grouse of the voters in the area, who hardly see their elected representatives once they are elected.

Traditionally a Congress bastion, Khed witnesses a multi-cornered contest with the real fight between Nationalist Congress Party NCP) candidate Mohol, a sitting MP, and Shiv Senaâ€™s Shivajirao Adhalrao Patil.

Besides Mohol and Patil, other candidates in the fray are Bahujan Samaj Partyâ€™s Vivek Kudale and Republican Party of Indiaâ€™s Laxman Bhosale and two independents.

The lone incident of a scuffle between NCP and Shiv Sena workers broke out at a polling booth near the residence of Sena candidate Adhalrao in Landewadi-Chinchodi village. NCP workers alleged that they were not allowed by the Sena workers to set up a party ''booth'' near the Landewadi polling station.

Soon a huge mob led by Adhalrao gathered and the rival party workers exchanged blows before the police resorted to mild lathi charge to defuse the tension.

Deputy superintendent of police, Vijay Magar, was present when the incident took place. Later, a strong posse of policemen, led by police inspector Bharat Nimbalkar, was deployed at Landewadi and nearby areas like Manchar.

Adhalrao told the Times News Network that it was a ploy of the NCP workers to keep him ""confined"" to Landewadi.

""They wanted me to be here the whole day so that they could use their power in other areas,"" he said.

12,Discrepancies in exit polls: Sushma,"KANPUR: Union minister and senior BJP leader Sushma Swaraj on Tuesday claimed that there were discrepancies in the surveys and exit polls by various television channels.

Speaking to reporters at the Circuit House here, she reiterated that the BJP would bag 200 seats and the NDA tally would touch the 300 figure. â€œThe NDA will form the government with ease and apprehensions in this regard are baseless,â€� she said.

The BJP leader also claimed that the party would bag 50 seats in Uttar Pradesh.

She agreed with Prime Minister Vajpayeeâ€™s view that the BJP and SP had the same ideology, adding that the NDA had no problem in having an alliance with the Samajwadi Party and if needed it would definitely seek support of other regional parties.

â€œThe NDA will get clear mandate but we are not averse to seeking support from regional parties,â€� she added.

About the exit polls, she said that different channels were showing different number of seats but all showed the BJP as winner. She said that although the apex court had refused to put restriction on exit polls, the channels should clarify what was the sample size of the surveys and the polling booths covered by them.

On the massive response to Rahul Gandhiâ€™s roadshows in eastern UP, she said that the crowds would not transform into votes.

She refused to comment on Sonia Gandhiâ€™s foreign origin issue, saying it was totally a political issue not personal. She also made it clear that the gain of the Congress would not affect the BJP but would be the loss of Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party.

13,'Third Front will hold key to govt formation',"KANPUR: Rajya Sabha MP and celluloid star Shabana Azmi on Tuesday indicated that the Third Front comprising regional parties will hold the key to formation of the next government as the 14th Parliament will be a hung one in which stakes will be high for the smaller parties.

Speaking to mediapersons, Shabana Azmi, who was here in support of CPMâ€™s candidate Subhashini Ali, said that notwithstanding the National Democratic Allianceâ€™s (NDA) claims of a clear majority, the exit polls so far have predicted a hung Parliament. â€œThe Communist Party will also have its role in formation of the government,â€� she added.

She welcomed emergence of the Third Front, as it would balance the political system.

Asked about increased participation of cinestars in politics, Shabana agreed that glamour had made way into politics and even film stars were realising their responsibility towards the political system as was reflected by the stars turning up in huge numbers during the polling in Mumbai.

She, however, cautioned the cinestars contesting the Lok Sabha elections to live up to the peopleâ€™s expectations. â€œPeople have high expectations and film stars need to realise that politics is a serious job,â€� she added. She, however, refuted reports that cinestars were being paid money by political parties in lieu of campaigning for candidates.

â€œAs far as I know all the film stars have joined politics as per their own wish and there was no pressure of any kind,â€� she added.

Shabana said she was hurt by Prime Minister Vajpayeeâ€™s statement that Hindus and Muslims should bridge differences as bilateral relations between India and Pakistan had improved.

â€œThe prime minister has raised a question mark over the patriotism of Indian Muslims and his statement reflects that we are dependent on Pakistan,â€� she alleged.

She exhorted women leaders to get the womenâ€™s Bill passes, alleging that political parties had a dual policy on the issue.

She informed the gathering that she was supporting Congress candidate Kapil Sibbal and a few other non-NDA candidates.

14,Pota is BJP's brainchild: Mulayam,"KANPUR: Aiming to woo Thakur vote-bank in the region, chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav on Tuesday claimed that the infamous Pota was the brainchild of Bharatiya Janata Party and most of the cases were the brainchild of its leaders.

Addressing an election rally in favour of party candidate from Bilhaur constituency Lal Singh Tomar at Tones Chauraha, about 22 km from here, the chief minister contended that Kunda MLA Raghuraj Pratap Singh was booked under Pota only at the behest of the BJP, which was then partner of the Mayawati-led government.

The BJP leaders had hatched the conspiracy along with Mayawati to book Raja Bhaiyya.The time has come for the electorate to punish them for their follies, Mulayam said. The 15 per cent Thakur vote in Bilhaur could play decisive role in this constituency.

Reacting sharply to Prime Minister Vajpayeeâ€™s statement that both Samajwadi Party and BJP follow same ideology, Mulayam argued that it was another attempt of the prime minister and Sangh Pariwar to misguide the voter as the two parties were poles apart. The prime ministerâ€™s claim is absolutely baseless and there is no similarity between the two parties,he clarified.

SP has always opposed the BJP and would continue doing so in future , Mulayam announced. The chief minister lambasted the former chief minister and BSP supremo Mayawati alleging that she was working to the advantage of BJP candidates as most of the BSP candidates had been fielded only to weaken the Samajwadi Party.
