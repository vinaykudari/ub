0,Ticket to ride: Touts rule Howrah,"kolkata: in spite of a drive at least once a month, harassment of passengers by touts at howrah station is still going on unabated. the station authorities admit that until a massive drive is taken against them, they will continue to rule the station premises and particularly the ticket counters. we arrest touts almost everyday. about three hundred such arrests are made every year. but these people always manage to return, said nilmoni barik, the officer-in-charge of howrah government railway police station. according to barik, most of the charges under which the touts are booked are bailable. so, these people always manage to get back. we have displayed photographs of some notorious touts in front of all the reservation counters and inside the station premises. i am planning to undertake yet another drive on a larger scale soon, barik added. according to eastern railway sources, the security commissioner of the railway protection force (rpf) have been instructed to depute a team of constables in front of all mail trains before they leave howrah station. our constables will be posted in front of the unreserved compartments of all the trains. we do not have so many people at present and so we have decided to target the mail trains first, said the senior security commissioner of the rpf, dr s.c. shahoo. according to shahoo, the rpf has decided to detain the touts and then handover the persons to the government railway police (grp) for prosecution. you will be absolutely mistaken if you think that only the touts are hijacking our sleep. there are people whom we call towel spreaders. these people forcefully occupy a seat inside a train compartment by spreading their gamchha or towel on the seat. our next drive will be targeted towards them, said somnath mukherjee, divisional railway manager at howrah station. meanwhile, the eastern railway claimed that they have created an all time record, by apprehending and booking nearly 4.56 lakh passengers and earning 3.18 crore from april to may 2001. the railway also claimed that ticket checking special trains at the sealdah station are giving rich dividends.
