0,Banking services hit due to riots,"ahmedabad: the repercussions of the ongoing riots are visible in the clearing house operations of banks, which though not at a standstill, have registered a significant drop in transactions. many bank branches in curfew-bound and sensitive areas are still unable to function. with large-scale absenteeism, offering customer and clearing facilities have become difficult for most commercial and co-operative banks. ""the clearing house facilities are affected negatively by riots,"" said sbi''s k c chakco. ""there was a drop of 62,000 cheques in ahmedabad in the past one month compared with february. in february sbi had received 1,88,586 cheques, while in march the number of cheques stood at 1,26,472."" during february 4 to 9 the cheques sent to other banks by sbi were 98,079 and the amount involved was rs 599.19 crore. during the same period in march it was 56,493 cheques and the amount was rs 372.65 crore. this indicates an approximate 40 per cent drop in sbi''s clearing house operations in the city. gcci president kalyan shah said that with the drop in clearing house operations, the cost of business is going up in the city. for small- and medium-scale companies, which mostly bank only with one bank, these are difficult times as far as liquidity is concerned. vishnu varshney, managing director of gujarat venture finance ltd said, ""many banks having branches in areas like panch kuva, jamalpur and kalupur have still not started their normal operations. and this has resulted in liquidity crisis for small- and medium-scale business houses. riots are going on since a month and banks have not come up with alternative arrangements to offer customer and clearing house services."" ""it is becoming increasingly difficult for banks to offer clearing house facilities during the riots,"" said a senior banker. due to the riots many branches do not open and cannot participate in transactions. ""we receive around 1,500 cheques daily for clearance of which 500 are sent back,"" he admitted. the delay in transactions ultimately results in the breakdown of the clearing system which affects trade and industry, said varshney. many bankers feel that the government must recognise clearing facility as an essential service and bank employees in curfew-bound areas be given police protection to resume operations. however, c d shrinivasan from the rbi said, ""initially the clearing facilities were affected, but the situation eased to some extent after march 18. j m patel from the state level banking committee said, ""even during march the average daily clearing figure at rs 700 crore to rs 750 crore was comparable with the pre-riot days."" the fact that the daily clearing figure in march were at par with the annual daily average shows that during the ongoing riots banking transactions have not been negatively affected, shrinivasan said.

9,Unqualified principal stays put despite tribunal order,"kolkata: this is one case of stretching the definition of â€˜work culture.â€™ the principal of the government engineering college, kalyani, continues in office despite the state administrative tribunal ruling his appointment illegal on february 8, this year. parajit dey was appointed following a public service commission advertisement in an english daily on january 24, 1998, for the posts of two principals. dey got the job, despite not being adequately qualified. according to tribunal judgement, â€œdr dey being a mining engineer, his qualification cannot be considered to be equivalent of the discipline of civil/ electrical/ mechanical/ electronics/ computer engineering. besides, he has experience as assistant professor of mining which is not relevant for the post advertised.â€� a complaint was filed by an applicant amarendra kumar samaddar choudhury, who was ignored despite having a first class be degree, 87 per cent marks in m.tech and ph.d. in electrical engineering. state higher education minister satya sadhan chakrabarty has refused to comment on the verdict, but his department officials say that the only saving grace for the government would be to contest the decision in a higher court. â€œbut we are not very sure as the tribunal, in no ambiguous term, has said that the appointment was a violation of article 309 of the constitution of india,â€� said an officer. not only did the government not obey the order, but is also holding up the matter unnecessarily without appealing in a higher court. â€œthe tribunal judgement clearly states that the appointment will have to be set aside,â€� said an official. although plaintiff choudhury feels that justice has been done, he is helpless thanks to the governmentâ€™s nonchalance to the issue. â€œi never expected the government to ignore it even after the verdict,â€� he said. according to the judgement, â€œrespondent authorities violated the recruitment rules, under article 309 of the indian penal code, so far as the essential qualifications for the post of principal area concerned...the principal should have a qualification in the subject being taught at the relevant engineering colleges or which forms a part of the curriculum of the concerned colleges.â€� the order further reads, â€œit is ordered that the selection and appointment of respondent dr p. dey is hereby set aside. the respondent authorities are given the liberty to fill up the two posts of principal strictly in accordance with the prevailing rules and after observing all the necessary formalities.â€� the teaching community is also disappointed with the government attitude. â€œif this is the way the government chooses to treat the state administrative tribunalâ€™s verdict, then how do we seek justice?â€� wondered benoy bhushan chakraborty, president of the all bengal state government college teachers association.

13,Anti-incumbency will not reflect in LS polls: Cong,"new delhi: it has won every election it has fought in recent times. and is buoyant about its chances in the next lok sabha polls. but is the congress already wary of the anti-incumbency factor in the many states that it rules? the congress officially denies this, insisting that traditional anti-incumbency weariness will not reflect in lok sabha polls, whether now or in due course two years later. ""there is an overwhelming mood for change in the country and that will far outweigh such factors"", senior leader oscar fernandes said. but actions speak louder. the meeting of congress chief ministers called by party president sonia gandhi in guwahati later this month will focus on ""evaluating the implementation of various schemes, especially aimed at social upliftment"" in the states, spokesman anand sharma said on monday. party leaders say sonia is taking keen interest in ensuring that the same factors which have led to an erosion of support base for arch rivals bjp, should not afflict the congress, which is now sensing a comeback at the centre. a senior leader said the party was also focussing on bagging other states up for election soon, rather than try and precipitate mid-term elections in the country. this way, the party feels, its hold all over the country will be well established. also, it is felt that in the next two years, the bjp can only make matters worse for itself. while nda allies are raising a voice of dissent on various issues, they are not expected to pull the rug from under the coalition government''s feet just yet. for the congress, these parties withdrawing support would in any case not naturally translate to allying with it. the leader admitted that the congress, being a major player in most states, could not go in for pre-election alliances with the ease that the bjp could. ""we are fighting these parties in most elections. the congress would like to make it on its own."" an alliance with either the telugu desam party or the cpi(m) would be near impossible, with the parties at loggerheads in andhra pradesh and west bengal respectively. the leader, thus, ruled out pre-poll tie-ups with regional parties but said post elections, equations could change. the party is aware that despite recent victories there are problems of basic arithmetic too. in states like uttar pradesh, bihar, tamil nadu and west bengal, which together make up for about 225 lok sabha seats, the congress is only a peripheral player. as part of the ongoing consolidation process, thus, a merger with the tamil maanila congress in tamil nadu is on the cards soon. in bihar, where the party lives an uneasy existence in the shadow of laloo prasad yadav''s rashtriya janata dal, the congress performed surprisingly well in recent panchayat elections. contesting separately, the party came in a creditable second, ahead of the bjp and any of its allies. in crucial up, however, despite all assertions, revival seems a long way off for the congress. but in the shake-ups which began with the unexpected posting of senior leader ghulam nabi azad as jammu and kashmir congress committee chief, a revamp of the up unit is on the cards. the guwahati meeting on april 12 and 13 is the third such conclave. the other two were held in november 2000 and may 2001. the congress rules 14 states and has a say in three others.

14,White Paper an act of political chicanery: SAD,"chandigarh: upset over the white paper released by the congress government blaming squarely the sad-bjp governance for the empty coffers and economic mess that the state finds itself in, the sad hit back on monday saying that the white paper was an act of â€˜â€˜political chicanery that reflected bankruptcy of thought, action and determination to performâ€�. former finance minister kanwaljit singh debunked the paper as â€˜â€˜half truth presenting distorted facts.â€�talking to media persons here he said there was â€œnothing original in it which reflected the congress governmentâ€™s feeble attempt to apportion blame on the sad-bjp government with glaring contradictions.â€� in a strong-worded statement, senior sad leader said the congress seemed to be running away from its pre-poll commitments and creating alibis for leaving heavy doses of taxes and put crushing burden on the people of the state. reeling out comparative figures the former finance minister firmly sought to rebut the congress propaganda that the sad-bjp government drained the resources and caused irreparable damage to the state economy. he said during the five year sad-bjp rule, both industry and agriculture witnessed unprecedented growth. while rs 16,000 crore worth investement was made in heavy and medium industry, rs 1,715 crores were invested in the small scale units. the farm sector saw pumping in of additional resources to the tune of rs 20,000 crores, something that had never happened in the past. the sales tax revenue shot up from rs 1,264 crores in 1996-97 to rs 2,644 crores in 2000-2001 even as tax and non-tax revenue witnessed steep hike from rs 4,457 crores in 1996-97 to rs 8,399 crores in 2000-2001. similarly, the stateâ€™s own tax revenue recorded phenomenal increase from rs 2,734 crores in 1996-97 to rs 4,897 crores last year even as the annual growth rate of the state economy hovered around 5.05 per cent, which was higher than the national average. he said nothing was far from the truth than to say that the akalis left the economy in a shambles. former finance minister said whatever debt was raised to undertake development works was much in accordance with the guidelines laid down by the reserve bank of india. the congress was trying to project an absolutely erroneous scene by saying that the state coffers were empty and that the state was reeling under heavy debt, he added. at the end of the last financial year, capt kanwaljit said, the stateâ€™s total debt stood at rs 27,830 crores, which included loans against small savings, central assistance for the plan and employeesâ€™ provident funds. he clarified that no state was allowed to raise loans from the market. the rules are clearly laid down under which a state could raise funds, which included market borrowings within an overall limit fixed by the rbi. the sad leader justified his governmentâ€™s policy of raising last-minute loans to undertake development works and instead regretted that the congress government had withdrawn grants worth rs 285 crores earmarked for development works in panchayats and municipalities. yet, the former finance minister had a word of caution and advice for the congress government.

16,Punjab govt moves to suspend Sidhu,"chandigarh: punjab government has initiated the process of recommending action against and immediate suspension of punjab public service commission (ppsc) chairman ravinder paul singh sidhu. during an informal chat with the times of india, punjab chief secretary y s ratra, said that the government has started the process of recommending sidhuâ€™s removal. under the constitution, the chairman or member of a commission can only be removed by order of the president that too on the charge of misbehaviour. however, before taking this extreme step, the president must make a reference to the supreme court (sc), which is required to conduct an inquiry into the matter, in accordance with the procedure laid down under article 145 of the constitution. only when the sc arrives at a conclusion will the chairman or member be removed on a particular charge. the procedure of removing a chairman or members is time consuming. the suspension, however, could be immediate. the inquiry initiated against sidhu, under article 145, in the criminal case registered on the charge of accepting bribe is expected to go beyond sidhuâ€™s term, which expires later this year. bearing this in mind, the punjab government has been trying to get sidhu suspended. the governor is also empowered to suspend the chairman, a reference in this respect, had also been made in the sc by the president. the suspension would continue till the president passes an order on the sc report. punjab government is also anxious to get the working of the commission back on track.

17,A setback for political appointees,"chandigarh:the punjab government last week issued an order to all heads of department that no communication or order from any political appointee in the chief ministerâ€™s office, especially a political secretary or an officer on special duty should be honoured or obeyed. the order, issued by coordination department, is explicit in its instructions and makes an exception only in the case of both principal secretary to the chief minister and the chief secretary.the order states that even the chief ministerâ€™s instructions are to be taken on file. the order follows a virtual pandemonium in the chief ministerâ€™s office last week when two osds virtually barged into the office of an official in the cmo and asked him to â€˜â€˜hand over files pertaining to the department of education.â€™â€™ when the official asked the two osds to produce an authorisation for the files, the latter are learnt to have brazenly replied that they â€˜â€˜did not need any such work order.â€™â€™ it is learnt that only after the cmâ€™s principal secretary s k sinha intervened that the two osds backed off. the new order has been welcomed by many in the bureaucracy. one senior bureaucrat said that the move was welcome as many of the political appointees routinely interfered in administrative work and the practice had become a source of corruption. â€œthis order, if it is implemented properly, has the potential to check the emergence of extra-constitutional centres of power that have been the bane of governance in the past,â€� he remarked. another bureaucrat said that though the order may go some way in providing better governance, it showed the compulsions of the chief minister to project a clean image of his government.
