1,CM's sops reflect govt failure: CPI,"HYDERABAD: The CPI on Sunday said the cabinetâ€™s approval for the chief ministerâ€™s welfare measures vindicated its stand that the government has failed in delivering assistance to the people.

In an exclusive interview to The Times of India on Sunday, CPI state secretary Suravaram Sudhakar Reddy said: â€œIt justifies our stand that the governmentâ€™s precautionary measures were woefully inadequate in the face of natureâ€™s wrath. The welfare package, barely two months after the approval of the budget, reflects a total failure of the state governmentâ€™s delivery systems. The cabinet gave its nod for the welfare measures only with an eye on the elections,â€� he said.

Reddy said the government had submitted to the Assembly that Rs 175 crore had been released for facilitating drinking water, seed supplies, supply of fodder, employment generation schemes and input subsidies for farmers who have lost more than 50 per cent of their crop. But that wasnâ€™t the case, he said.

He said when the opposition had demanded an end to forcible collection of dues in drought-affected areas and budgetary allocation for drought relief, the chief minister turned a blind eye to the pleas. He instead accused the opposition of lying, he said.

Reddy said despite his partyâ€™s warning on the impending crisis due to monsoon failure, the government did little, leaving a third of the state in the grip of drought.

2,"Man shoots in-law, jumps off building","BANGALORE: The son-in-law of a city college principal committed suicide after earlier attempting to shoot his father-in-law. The bizarre incident occurred on Saturday night.

Mahesh (35) attempted to kill Venkataraju (56), the principal of Sheshadripuram Junior College, at the latterâ€™s Jayanagar VII Block residence.

On Saturday, Mahesh who often visited his in-laws, had been in the Jayanagar house since 6 pm.

At around 9.45 pm, he barged into the living room, armed with a licensed pistol and shotgun, and opened fire at Venkataraju.

As his father-in-law collapsed, Mahesh attempted to attack his wife, Rashmi. However, Rashmi, her mother and two siblings managed to overpower him. Mahesh dropped the weapons and rushed out of the house.

He then reportedly drove to Barton Centre on M.G. Road around 11 pm, and jumped from the 11th floor. His body was found lying in a pool of blood by passers-by who informed the police.

Venkataraju had a miraculous escape, after the bullet fired from the pistol at point-blank range scraped through his jaw bone and exited through the cheek. He is out of danger and recovering in hospital, the police said.

The incident is allegedly connected to a dowry dispute. In a complaint to the Jayanagar police, Rashmi has stated that her husband often demanded more dowry from her parents.

Though Mahesh had threatened his in-laws repeatedly, he had not used any force on them till Saturday, a police officer said.

Senior police officers rushed to Venkatarajuâ€™s residence and also to Barton Centre. The Jayanagar and Cubbon Park police stations have registered separate cases.

Family background: Mahesh, an engineer, was married to Venkatarajuâ€™s daughter V. Rashmi (30), an IAS officer and chief executive officer, Mysore Zilla Panchayat, and was the father of an 11-month-old child.

While Rashmi lived in Mysore after being posted there recently, Mahesh lived in a farmhouse in Nelamangala. The couple had married around four years ago.

Rashmi is a 1996 batch IAS officer. She served in the Bangalore City Corporation before being posted as Joint Registrar of Cooperative Societies, Bangalore. Last month, Rashmi was posted as the CEO, Mysore Zilla Panchayat.

According to her colleagues at the Zilla Panchayat, Rashmi is an efficient officer and has reviewed the functioning of all the taluk panchayats in a monthâ€™s time.

5,WTO norms harm farmers: Govindacharya,"HYDERABAD: The Swadeshi Jagran Manch (SJM) has asked the Centre to review the World Trade Organisation (WTO) agreements implemented till date and prepare a strong ground for the next round of talks to be held at Mexico in September.

The SJM felt that the Mexico round of talks would be very crucial for the country as negotiations on agriculture would be the focal point at the meet. The government should take the nation into confidence and adopt a stand and it should also take the opinion of all the political parties as well as organisations that were working against the WTO, the SJM felt.

SJM steering committee member Govindacharya, speaking at a public meeting organised on the concluding day of the 21-day Swadeshi Sangarsha Yatra, which were taken out in Rayalaseema and Telangana regions on Sunday, warned that if the evil designs of the US and other developed nations were not checked at Mexico, the Indian farmers would be badly affected.

â€œWe must learn lessons from Brazil. A similar situation will arise in India, if the government fails to check the developed nations,â€� he warned. He condemned the role played by the US and other developed countries on many global issues and said that India should take lead in protecting the interests of the developing countries. He alleged that they were trying to grab the Indian market by â€˜hook or crook.â€™

â€œThe Bill Gates Foundation donated lakhs of dollars for Hepatitis B vaccine distribution in the country. Bill Gates is not only the chairman of the Foundation but also the proprietor of Merk company that produces the vaccine. He introduced his production through the Foundation making it look like a generous help, but his intention is to market it in the future,â€� he alleged.

Condemning the US attack on Iraq accusing it of possessing weapons of mass destruction (WMDs), Govindacharya said the US owes an explanation to the world for failing to find WMDs. The UN should take action against USA and Britain for misguiding the world on the issue.

SJM state unit convenor Gopal Reddy, S P Y Reddy of Nandi group of industries and others also spoke on the occasion.

6,Police avert violence in Talhan,"TALHAN, Jalandhar: The situation in Talhan village is far from normal even three days after curfew was imposed in wake of violent clashes between Dalit and Jat inhabitants over the contentious issue of sharing control of a gurdwara.

The situation could have taken a violent turn on Sunday morning despite the curfew being in force, but timely intervention of the police prevented it from getting out of hand, even though a constable suffered a deep cut on his hand. During a visit to the village on Sunday, the officials on duty told the TNN team that a group of more than 100 Dalits youths came menacingly towards the house of Paramjit Singh Bains, who they alleged had used abusive language against a Dalit woman for stealing fodder from his fields.

The constable, Gurcharan Singh, injured in the process, was reportedly admitted to Civil Hospital, Jalandhar. Jalandhar SSP Varinder Kumar, camping at the village, confirmed the development, but said the situation was brought under control. Reinforcements were immediately dispatched to the village already under heavy police deployment.

Meanwhile, a group of about 35-40 persons led by Damdami Taksal spokesman Mohkam Singh also reached the village reportedly on the request of the gurdwara management.

They carried traditional weapons including double-edged swords and spears. The uneasiness was palpable right from the road leading to the village with little movement.

The residents of the villages en route said that this was due to the fear factor gripping the devotees, who used to come for paying obeisance at the controversial gurdwara on every Sunday. Most of the roadside shops remained closed while owners of the few open were sitting idle.

Dalit action committee president Chanan Ram Pal said over telephone that he had complained to the deputy commissioner about the lax enforcement of curfew, which was responsible for Sundayâ€™s confrontation. â€œI requested the DC to enforce strictness to prevent armed outsiders from entering the village,â€� he said. Also, that he and former panchayat member Sadhu Ram were called by the DC at the village to suggest a solution to the problem.

Some stranded residents who had gone out to attend urgent work during the relaxation, cursed both groups for creating difficulties for them.

Shingara Singh, a mason sitting in front of the village entrance, had to spend the night with relatives at Rama Mandi after he was not allowed in. Similarly, a Dalit woman, Puro, who had come from Malerkola to visit her daughterâ€™s family, had been waiting since morning. Looking longingly at his residence just about 50 yards from the entrance, Surinder Singh Fauji, said the unsavoury developments entailed collective harm. â€œBoth sides should sit together and admit their past mistakes to maintain harmony.

After all, we have to live together,â€� he suggested.

7,Zero tolerance? Babus brazenly encroach on govt land & stay cool,"CHANDIGARH: Brazen encroachment on government land by none other than government officials!

While on one hand the UT administration has woken up to the issue of mushrooming illegal encroachments and started bulldozing unauthorised constructions in different areas, UT officials seem to have turned a blind eye to those sectors which house government employees.

Far removed from the din and bustle of the anti-encroachment drives which have rendered thousands homeless, officials residing in Sector have been tending to their gardens regularly. Nothing wrong probably, except that majority of them have encroached on government land. Take house number 10 for instance. Residence of Chandigarh Housing Board (CHB) chairman G K Marwah, it too speaks of encroachment. Extending beyond the boundary wall, stands a well-kept fenced garden. And Marwah is not alone. Many such gardens dot the sector landscape.

Speaking to Times News Network, Marwah says, â€˜â€˜These type of encroachments have not been targeted anywhere. What has been targeted are encroachments on a bigger scale which include illegal occupation of land, illegal construction on houses or illegal opening on V-3 roads.â€™â€™

â€˜â€˜I have no problem if the department which is responsible for removing such encroachments removes it today. But it will be wrong to compare this encroachment with the type of encroachments being targeted,â€™â€™ he adds.

IAS officer H P Chaudhry of house number 723 has erected a fenced boundary. Not only has he nurtured a kitchen garden but also constructed a garage â€˜â€˜at my (his) own costâ€™â€™. â€˜â€˜This is not an encroachment. Since there is no boundary wall, it would have become a garbage dumping ground. To facilitate parking for others coming to the house, we have constructed a garage,â€™â€™ he says.

A survey points out that gardens and garages have come all over Sector 7 on government land. In certain houses, the back courtyard has been extended to encroach on the malba dumping ground.

The slots outside house boundary walls are called â€˜road reservationsâ€™ which are meant for road expansions and public use. â€˜â€˜As long as one doesnâ€™t raise the level, erect barbed wires or hedges, it is not an encroachment,â€™â€™ says a source.

In Sector 23 too encroachments are rampant. Even as byelaws say that minimum six feet space should be left in front of houses for pedestrians, majority of the houses adjoining the post office, mostly of government officials, have encroachments.

While flower beds have come up in in some places, in others the boundary has been extended to construct a garage. An officer of Haryana food and supplies department Baljit Guleria says that the encroachments prevent garbage dumping.

Mayor Subhash Chawla says the officials should set an example for others. â€˜â€˜Government officers have no moral right to carry out anti-encroachment drives when they themselves are at fault,â€™â€™ he adds.

Reacting to his press statement where he said that official machinery was being used for demolitions against his wishes, the BJP has demanded the mayorâ€™s resignation since he does not wield authority. However, speaking to TNN over phone from Delhi, MP Pawan Kumar Bansal has dubbed BJPâ€™s demand as â€˜â€˜absurdâ€™â€™ and said that officials responsible for allowing encroachments to come up in the city need to be identified.

8,Panchayat polls: Congress re-invents freebie mantra,"MUKTSAR: Free power, free five-marla plots for the landless, 100 per cent increase in Shagun scheme, employment to families living below poverty line, increase in pension.

These were some of the freebies listed in the Congress manifesto, released in January last year, prior to the assembly elections.When the party came to power in Punjab, these were put on the back burner for the first 16 months of its term. But, once the schedule for panchayat elections was announced, Congress leaders are back to spouting these slogans to woo the ruralites.

While the party leaders are shying away from making any announcement vis-a-vis providing free power and water to the upper caste farmers, they have started talking of reintroducing the shagun scheme and giving possession of five-marla land plots to the landless.

Addressing a block-level meeting of the party at Gidderbaha in Muktsar on Saturday, Punjab Congress Committee president HS Hanspal said that the Shagun scheme would be re-introduced in the state for providing financial assistance of Rs 5,100 to a Dalit family during girlâ€™s marriage.

The Congress government had withdrawn the Shagun scheme after coming to power, promising to enhance it to Rs 11,000. Now, Hanspal has announced that the old scheme would be resumed and the benefit could be increased later. The ruling party ruffled many feathers on another front close to the ruralites heart: Old-age pension.

After coming to power, the Punjab government scrapped one-fourth of the old-age pensions in the area, terming the beneficiaries as fake. Those deprived of the benefit were annoyed with the state government. In Bathinda district, verification of these pensions by the social welfare department last year revealed that about one-third of 22810 pensioners enrolled during the Akali-BJP regime after April 1, 2000, were fake. Investigations revealed they were not entitled to pension benefits as they did not meet the age or economic criteria fixed by the government, and had provided false documents.

However, the ruralites do not appear to be very impressed with the Congress campaign. Laxman Singh Sewewala, general secretary, Punjab Khet Mazdoor Union, termed them as empty promises. He alleged that the Congress and the Akalis have only switched roles after elections. They accuse each other of the same things when out of power, but become defensive about them when they are at the helm of affairs, he alleged. He pointed out that in October-November 2001, the Akalis had distributed allotment papers of five-marla plots with an eye to the assembly elections. But till date, the beneficiaries have not been given possession.

9,"Akalis gear up to confront Cong govt, hold meet","BATHINDA: After their leader Parkash Singh Badal expressed fear of his being arrested by the Punjab government within next two-three days on Saturday, the district bodies of Shiromani Akali Dal (Badal) convened meeting of their leaders on Sunday to chalk out a strategy to confront the government.

In Bathinda, Sikander Singh Malooka, the district president of SAD (B), convened an emergency meeting of party leaders at the residence of Baljeet Singh, managing director of cooperative banks. The meeting was attended by senior party leaders, including Gura Singh Tungwali, Makhan Singh, Chiranjee Lal Garg, Mukhtiar Singh, Darshan Kaur Toofan and Satnam Singh Bhairupa.

In the meeting, the leaders chalked out the strategy to mount pressure on the state government in case Badal was arrested. The leaders warned the state government that it would have to face very violent protest which might include burning of buses, suicide attempts by party workers and traffic blockades.

Former minister Malooka said that the state government should prepare itself to meet violent protest before arresting Badal. He said that as the state government could not produce any clinching evidence against any of the Akali leaders arrested so far, they now wanted to arrest Badal.

He said that the move of planning arrest of Badal was to divert peopleâ€™s attention from the caste clash in Talhan village and take benefit of Badalâ€™s absence from political scene in the panchayat elections.

As Congress was facing defeat in panchayat elections in absence on any issue in the election to harp on, so it was planning to arrest Badal.

The sources in the Akali Dal revealed that such district level meetings were being organised all over the state.

10,Monsoon delay not to affect farmers: Rajnath,"BANGALORE: The delay in the onset of monsoon in the country will not have any adverse impact on agricultural production this year, Union Agriculture Minister Rajnath Singh said on Monday.

""The one week delay in monsoon will not have any adverse impact on agricultural production,"" Singh told reporters on the sidelines of the World Seed Congress here.

The government would not revise the estimate for agriculture production and its exports, he said referring to the arrival of monsoon in the north east and the Kerala coast.

Earlier, in his inaugural address at the Seed Congress, organised by the International Seed Federation for the first time in Asia, Singh called on the Indian seed industry to play a major role in dissemination of the latest agricultural technologies to the farmers by providing ""good quality seeds"" to them.

""As Indian economy is changing rapidly, the Indian seed industry must also change and compete with the global industry in technology, quality, innovation and cost-effectiveness for the benefit of the farmers in India and abroad,"" he said.

Singh said the concerns of potential impact on human health and environment through genetically modified crops must be addressed if the benefits of this technology were to reach the farmers.

12,"Vajpayee would lead party, NDA in next polls: Venkaiah","CHENNAI: BJP President M Venkaiah Naidu on Monday asserted that Prime Minister A B Vajpayee would lead the party and the NDA in the next Lok Sabha polls.

He told reporters here on Monday that Vajpayee was not only a leader of the BJP and the NDA but of the entire country, while the Opposition was unable to project any leader as the prime ministerial candidate.

On RSS leader K S Sudarshan''s remarks that the BJP should concentrate on its ideology and not on personality cult, he said Sudarshan had stated that there was nothing wrong in projecting a leader during the election time.

He said the BJP wanted to win 300 seats on its own and gain two third majority along with its allies in the next Lok Sabha polls.

""Even if we get a majority on our own, we will continue with the NDA experiment. Development will be our plank for the polls. For development, we require some constitutional amendments and that is why we seek a mandate of two-thirds majority,"" he said.

He said the party would decide on the alliances with other parties only after the polls were announced and would concentrate on ''expansion'' of the party now.

Ruling out early Lok Sabha polls, he said the polls would be held as scheduled in 2004.

Asked whether all the constituents of NDA would continue in the alliance for the Lok Sabha polls, he said ''wait and see''.

14,"Unions, banks, RBI adopt clean currency notes policy","MUMBAI: Bank managements, various unions and Reserve Bank of India will work together to supply good notes to the public as part of the apex bank''s clean note policy.

RBI Governor Bimal Jalan told representatives of United Forum of Bank Unions (UFBU), an umbrella organisation of nine unions in banking sector, who met him on Monday to discuss this issue, that the apex bank was keen to implement its clean note policy for the benefit of public who deserved clean notes.

However, the policy was not intended to cause any problem or difficulty to bank staff or customers, Jalan pointed out.

The forum expressed its difficulties faced by bank staff while implementing the policy, RBI said in a release here.

UFBU, last week, had urged RBI to continue with note stapling system in the interest of general public as well as bank employees.

The paper binding or twin binding system as suggested by RBI for note bundling was very risky considering the fact that it was very easy to withdraw notes and also replace them with other notes, which in long run would create distrust between banks and general public, UBFU Convenor (West Bengal) Ashok Datta had said.

He had, however, suggested that RBI might come out with a directive asking banks not to staple a bundle more than once.

The UBFU had alleged that RBI had decided to ban stapling of note as it wanted to close down its note inspection department which employed over 5000 people.

15,Few major investment initiatives criticised at KPCC meet,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Some of the major investment and policy initiatives of the UDF Government came in for sharp criticism at the KPCC meeting on Monday, which suggested that corrective measures be taken up.

The meeting, held in the presence of AICC general secretary Ahmed Patel, recommended that the government keep in abeyance, the controversial joint-sector mineral sand-mining project along the Alapuzha coast. It also wanted the government to move carefully on the proposed unified university bill.

The discussions at the meeting, held in the backdrop of fresh factional squabbles, skirted the internal issues, focussing mainly on the government and the party.

Briefing reporters on the deliberations, KPCC president K Muraleedharan said ""none said the government was a total failure or a complete success.""

The meeting suggested that the Government appoint an experts'' committee to study the sand-mining project in view of apprehensions of the coastal community, especially fisher folk.

Expressing concern over the slow pace of implementation of projects materialised at the GIM, the KPCC asked the government to speed up the projects while taking care of the traditional sectors.

Patel will meet senior Congress leader K Karunakaran, a cross section of party leaders and leaders of UDF partners before his return to Delhi on Tuesday.

16,Know your political leader by his nickname,"AHMEDABAD/VADODARA/RAJKOT: Municipal councillor in Vadodara Chandrakant Shrivastav ate so much â€˜bhaatâ€™ (rice) in his childhood that his parents nicknamed him Bhatthu. And it stuck even after he turned into a hot-headed politician in his teens.

â€œI was short-tempered and people thought it was all because I ate too much rice. But it the no-one-messes-with-Bhatthubhai image that works for me,â€� he adds proudly.

Politicians of Gujarat have turned their nicknames into big brands. Many donâ€™t even recall what their original name is. But that suits these politicians fine, they say, because it gives a degree of informality in their dealings with people.

Former Vadodar a deputy mayor, Shailesh Mehtaâ€™s ability to get things done in a jiffy in the university earned him the sobriquet â€˜sottaâ€™ (whip).

â€œPeople at Waghodia Road only know me only as Sotta now, if you ask them the address of Shailesh Mehta, they wouldnâ€™t know,â€� he says â€œIt all started with my mother calling me Dabbu,â€� says another municipal councillor Yogesh Patel better known as â€˜Doubleâ€™. â€˜Dabbu'' morphed into â€˜Doubleâ€™ after he joined the Jan Sangh in 1972 and, during the assembly elections, stood opposite his father. â€œPeople started calling me â€˜Doubleâ€™ because of my dual roles as a politician and a son,â€� he says Try addressing RSS ideologue Pravin Maniar by his real name in Rajkot and chances are that he may not respond at all. â€œI am so much used to being addressed as â€˜Kakaâ€™ that I introduce myself as that. If you call me Mr Maniar, I may not respond,â€� says Maniar.

The nickname became popular because of Maniarâ€™s nephew, just two years younger to him. â€œHe followed me to school and college and he used to call me Kaka. Thatâ€™s how the name stuck,â€� he says.

Maniar believes this name helps him create instant rapport with people. Yet another Kaka, Surendra Patel, the chairman of Ahmedabad Urban Development Authority, too identifies more with his nickname.

And similar is the case with Natwarlal Patel, chairman of AMCâ€™s transport committee, who is better known as Natu Mama. Or try looking for Ruknoddin Mohammad Hussain Momin in Shahpur-Raikhad, where he is the municipal councillor. â€œNobody in my neighbourhood would recognise me by that name,â€� says Momin.

But ask for Rajubhai and 10 people will lead you to your destination. Though Raju is a Hindu name, Momin says he has grown up with it. â€œIt portrays me as a boy-next-door,â€� he says. Echoes Krushnavadan S Brahmbhatt, a councillor from Khadia. â€œThere is hardly anyone in Khadia who knows my real name.

â€˜Kokaâ€™ is the name I have grown up with,â€� says Brahmbhatt. â€œWhile addressing me by my nickname, people feel that I am one of them, a friend, a neighbour. It works to my advantage,â€� he says. Besides some biggies in state politics, there are at least dozen municipal councillors who are well-known by their pet names â€” at times weird â€” in their areas.

But these representatives have no problems with that. On the contrary, most of them prefer being called by these names. Bhanu Patel, a councillor from Bapunagar and the chairman of the AMCâ€™s estate committee is better known as Bhanu Boscan. â€œBoscan is the name my health club in Bapunagar,â€� says Patel.

â€œThere are at least 15 people by the name of Bhanu in the corporation. So instead of explaining which Bhanu you are, why not have an uncommon nickname?â€� he says.

17,Campaign starts for DGHC polls,"SUKHIAPOKHARI: Political parties in the hills have started gearing up for the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council elections scheduled to be held next year. The CPM recently held a public meeting at Sukhia Pokhari.

Senior CPM leader S. P. Lepcha said that no developmental work had been done in the DGHC under the rule of the Gorkha National Liberation Front. According to Lepcha, â€œPlenty of funds are given to the DGHC but the GNLF has not laid out any developmental plans for the hills.

There is a system of favouritism in the Council and the hill people should understand this .â€� According to him, internal feuds within the GNLF are leading to the murder of its leaders. The Gorkhaland agitation during the 1980s had started from Sukhia Pokhari and Manebhanjyang.

Another senior leader and committee member of All India Kisan Sabha , Anil Shah said that vested land in the hills have not been distributed properly by the DHGC. â€œThe reason behind this should be explained and the distribution of vested plots among the farmers should be done immediately.â€� The leaders said that only CPM can bring back the past glory of the Darjeeling hills and is the only alternative party in the hills who can run the DGHC.

18,Molest charge against lawyers,"ASANSOL: A housewife lodged an FIR with the Kalna police station against two lawyers of the Kalna court for raping her.

She was a regular visitor to one of the lawyersâ€™ houses with her second husband since December to settle cases relating to her first marriage. In her complaint, the woman alleged that she had been raped by one of the accused at a Behrampore hotel last month.

Then, again on 21 May, the two lawyers raped her repeatedly at one of their chambers and even threatened her with dire consequences when her husband rescued her. Later, one of the lawyers filed an FIR against her on June 3, accusing her of stealing his money and ransacking his office.

She was arrested the same day and released on bail on June 7. Burdwan superintendent of police B. Naga Ramesh has ordered a probe into the incident. No one has been arrested nor has the Kalna police sent the concerned woman for medical examination.

Local MLA and state minister Anju Kar said she has asked the members of the Ganatantrik Mahila Samiti to probe the rape charge and demand action against the two if found guilty. Stunned members of the Kalna Bar Association have called for a high-level probe, too.

19,'Uttarayan' raises hope for farmers,"DHUPGURI: With government infrastructure being woefully inadequate, Project Uttarayan, a private endeavour, has brought a ray of hope for the farmers of Dhupguri block in Jalpaiguri district, whic is even facing the prospect of law-and-order problems due to the overproduction of potato.

Since the price of potato has gone down to Rs 1,300 per tonne against the minimum production cost of Rs 1,800, farmers are being forced into dumping their potato crop on the road as they failed to arrange for permits to store their produce in cold storages. A potato farmer Md Maidul, sitting on one such road leading to Salbari from Dhupguri, said, â€œThis is the usual situation for most of the year.â€� He had to throw away nearly six tonnes of potatoes this year.

â€œA woefully inadequate cold storage capacity of Jalpaiguri encourages black marketing of permits,â€� said a senior police official. One such permit, costing Rs 2,000, sells in the black market at double the price and eventually leads to scuffles and law-and-order problems,â€� he added. According to figures available from the state agriculture department, against an average production of 100,000 tonne per year at Dhupguri, the total capacity of the five existing cold storages in this areas is only 50,000 tonnes.

Also, barring one, the others are privately owned. However, the farmers are looking forward to an upcoming multi-dimensional potato project, Uttarayan, that â€œwould ease the situation to a great extentâ€�, said a potato wholesaler. Managing director of the new company floating the multi-crore Uttarayan project at Salbari, S. Sarkar, 32, said, â€œOne should utilise this fertile soil to tap the global market.

We are trying to explore other avenues to increase potato consumption among the people, so that farmers can grow more potatoes and earn good returns round the year.â€� The project, planned as a semi-cooperative and the first phase of which will be launched next year, is looking towards exporting packed potato cubes, powder and alcohol. â€œFifty per cent of our margin would go towards R&D to prepare some more fascinating avenues,â€� added Sarkar.

20,Thousands administered 'fishy' medicine,"HYDERABAD: Children yelled as wriggling live fish, topped with a yellow substance, were stuffed down their throats at the Bathini Goud asthma medicine session here on Monday.

The elders who gulped down the wriggly creatures were convinced it was a permanent relief from breathlessness, wheezing and those painful sleepless nights.

â€˜â€˜Beta police pakdega. Chhota hai, kuch nahin hoga(The policemen will catch you. The fish is small, you wonâ€™t even feel it),â€™â€™ an anxious parent was heard telling his protesting son.

There were several thousands of them queuing patiently for hours at the cityâ€™s Exhibition Grounds. Two-year olds and three-year olds fought with all their strength to escape the â€˜fish- eatingâ€™ ritual. The fishâ€™s size was what most youngsters were worried about, as swallowing a live murrel is no easy task.

The Bathini Goud family has been administering fish medicine to asthma patients for the last 156 years. People from all over the country, suffering from problems such as high eosinophilia and asthma, flock to Hyderabad every year to take the medicine. This year it was no different. Close to 6 lakh people waited patiently for the magic cure.

The medicine, if taken for three consecutive years, is supposed to cure asthma patients, or so say the organisers.

21,"Delayed rain won't hit farm production, says Rajnath","BANGALORE: Union agriculture minister Rajnath Singh on Monday said the delay in the onset of monsoon will not impact agricultural production this year.

""The government will not revise the estimates for agriculture production and its export. Monsoon has already arrived in Kerala and North-East, and we hope agricultural production will be normal,"" he said on the sidelines of the World Seed Congress.

Reforms: Delivering the inaugural address at the meet, he said several reforms were introduced in the seed sector to promote investments. ""We want to ensure supply of quality seeds to our farmers.""

To encourage the seed industry, the Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers'' Rights Act 2001 had been introduced. ""It tries to strike a balance between farmers'' and plant breeders'' rights to provide an impetus to both national and MNCs to invest in seed sector.""

International Seed Federation president Christopher Ahrens stressed the need for preserving germ plasm by setting up gene banks. The ISF had donated $50,000 to the Asian Vegetable Research and Development Centre in Taiwan to computerise germ plasm. Conference National Organising Committee chairman Manmohan Attavar was nominated ISF Honorary Life Member. The next World Seed Congress will be held in May 2004 in Berlin, Germany.

22,More grains needed: Karnataka to Centre,"BANGALORE: The Karnataka government has requested the Centre for 3 lakh metric tonnes (mt) of food grains for ''food for work'' programme under drought relief works.

Karnataka home minister Mallikarjun M. Kharge, who heads the cabinet sub-committee on drought, told reporters on Monday after a meeting with the Union agriculture minister Rajnath Singh that the requisition was for three months (June-August).

""Of the 6.65 lakh mt of food grains allotted, we are left with 50,000 MT. I am confident the Centre will act on our fresh appeal to meet the demand in coming months.""

Kharge said Singh was convinced of the intensity of drought in the state. ""In fact, he appreciated the efforts of our government in tackling drought. Union agriculture and cooperation secretary R C A Jain is touring Kolar and Bangalore Rural districts to review drought-relief works.""

He said the state had to spend an additional Rs 100 crore for ''food for work'' programme if the Centre allotted 3 lakh mt of food grains. ""The finance department will arrange for it.""

Material: The government would appeal to the 12th Finance Commission to grant material apart from cash to create assets under drought-relief works.

""We will have access to cement and other construction material. It will also assist asset creation as instructed by Rajnath Singh,"" he added.

The commission had restricted the use of funds to rejuvenate or repair bore-wells. ""We will urge the Centre to relax this norm. We want funds to be utilised for drilling fresh bore-wells also.""

Rakes: Kharge said the Centre had assured allocation of additional rail wagons for transport of food grains and fodder from Punjab and Haryana to the state.

Examined: Earlier in the day, Rajnath Singh said the Centre was examining the requisition placed by Karnataka.

""We will examine their appeal and take a decision shortly,"" he said, and added that the Centre had already extended assistance worth Rs 4,000 crore to all drought-hit states.

23,Water farms will help agriculture: Swaminathan,"BANGALORE: Noted agricultural scientist M S Swaminathan on Monday suggested the Karnataka government should set up 500 low-water farm parks across the state to produce high-yielding crops under drought conditions.

Delivering the keynote address here on ""Sustainable Seed Security and Enhancing India''s Agriculture Competitiveness"" at the World Seed Congress here, he said such farm parks had proven to be of great assistance for crop production during times of distress.

""These parks are based on three fundamentals - water retention, water harvesting and high-yield crops. They provide better results under conventional conditions.""

He said salinity-resistant crops too had been developed by various agencies. ""Genes have been isolated from salinity-resistant mangroves to develop a variety of crops that can be grown with minimum water supply. Even these can be grown under drought conditions,"" he added.

Seed bank: Stressing on sustaining agricultural progress without causing ecological harm, he said during drought, farmers lost their seed stock. ""Seed reserves are essential for crop security, just as grain reserves are important for food security.""

He said India''s estimates for 2020 had projected production of 300 million tonnes of food grains, 200 million tonnes of fruits and vegetables and 100 million tonnes of milk. ""However, to realise these, we need to have a seed reserve.""

The problem of seed scarcity during unfavourable seasons was particularly acute in remote areas with poor communication. ""Hence, it will be useful to promote the establishment of community seed banks and undertake participatory breeding with farming families.""

24,SC notice to TN govt on college petition,"NEW DELHI: The Jayalalithaa government in Tamil Nadu will now have to answer to the Supreme Court about allegations of interference in the admission process to the prestigious Christian Medical College (CMC) at Vellore.

A vacation Bench of Justices R C Lahoti and Brijesh Kumar on Monday issued notice to the state government on the CMC''s petition saying that its practice of admitting students on the basis of an all-India entrance test was being interfered by the state government.

After hearing arguments by petitioner''s counsel P H Parekh, the Bench fixed June 16 for hearing the petition.

Parekh said the Supreme Court, through interim orders passed every year since 1994, had permitted CMC to admit students on the basis of the entrance test conducted by it. However, after the apex court pronounced its judgment on the admission procedure for minority educational institutions, the state government on May 14 this year directed the college authorities to admit students on the basis of the Tamil Nadu professional common entrance examination test.

CMC challenged the state government''s order and termed it as ``violative of its fundamental right'''' as the college was not getting any grant from the government.

26,Premium on govt's debt buyback to be set by auction,"NEW DELHI: The government is expected to start buyback of thousands of crores of high-interest bearing debt held by banks early next month.

The premium to be offered for this buyback will be set on the basis of a screen-based auction system to be monitored by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), officials said.

The buyback from the banks will be ``entirely voluntary and the premium to be offered will be set transparently as proposed in this year''s budget'''', the officials said.

The finance ministry has identified at least 24 government securities bearing high interest cost of over 12 per cent for the buyback. The quantum of the debt is about Rs 82,500 crore, but only half of it is proposed to be bought back during the current financial year.

The buyback of government securities held by banks is part of the Centre''s initiative announced in the budget this year to restructure its domestic debt. The buyback will reduce the government''s interest payment burden.

A large proportion of the banks'' holding of Centre''s domestic debt, contracted under the high interest regime of the past, is thinly traded. With the softening of interest rates, ordinarily such loans should command a premium over their face value. In effect, though, the banks are often unable to encash this because of limited liquidity.

The government, therefore, proposes to offer a buyback of such loans ^ entirely on a voluntary basis ^ from banks that are in need of liquidity or want cash for making provisions for their bad debt (non-performing assets) to improve their balance-sheets.

With interest rates moving southwards on virtually all debt instruments in the last four-five years and the average yield on benchmark 10-year government paper hovering at less than six per cent, the government intends to realign the rate of return on its securities with the market rate.

This year''s budget also proposed to provide an incentive for the banks offering the debt held by them for buyback by the government. If the banks declare the premium received as business income, for income-tax purposes, they will be allowed additional deduction to the extent such income is used for provisioning of their bad or doubtful debt.

The buyback will start once the RBI sorts out the problems arising out of the software for the screen-based auction system.

27,CM cautions party on quota for upper castes,"MUMBAI: Chief minister Sushilkumar Shinde cautioned party workers over the proposal for reservation in government jobs for economically backward people from upper castes. â€œIt is a double-edged weapon and we should be cautious about it,â€™â€™ he said.

Addressing a one-day training programme for party workers organised by the Mumbai Regional Congress Committee (MRCC) at Shanmukhananda Hall, he recalled that Maharashtra was the first state to give concessions to economically backward classes in educational fees. Mr Shinde lashed out at the NDA government for not keeping its promise and giving step motherly treatment to the state which was reeling under drought like conditions. Senior Congress leaders, including Vayalar Ravi, Balram Jhakar, Shivraj Patil and A.R. Antulay, criticised the BJP-led government in Delhi for â€œlack of vision and clearcut economic policies.â€™â€™ They asked the party workers to take on the Shiv Sena-BJP and explain to the people how these parties have failed to deliver goods.

Mr Shinde compared Congress president Sonia Gandhi to the â€œheadmasterâ€™â€™ of a school and recalled that all the chief ministers who attended the conclave in Srinagar recently had to do their homework properly before attending the meeting. She asked searching questions about progress in their respective states in fields like information technology and agriculture. MRCC president Gurudas Kamat, who organised the training camp, declared that the Congress was ready to go on its own and win the next assembly elections. He asked the party workers to take on the Shiv Sena which had given a call for â€œMee Mumbaikarâ€™â€™ campaign. This shows that the party is not nationalist in its outlook and indulges in Hitler-style campaigning on emotional issues, he said.

AICC general secretary in charge of Maharashtra Vayalar Ravi also gave a call to fight the Sena in its stronghold of Mumbai city. Former chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh also criticised the Shiv Senaâ€™s â€œMee Mumbaikarâ€™â€™ campaign describing it as an election stunt which would create problems. The MRCC is launching membership drive and is planning to recruit over 25 lakh members in Mumbai.
