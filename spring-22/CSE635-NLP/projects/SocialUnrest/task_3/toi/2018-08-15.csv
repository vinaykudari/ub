1,Studentsâ€™ protest holds up varsity admission,"kolkata: students of the department of visual arts, rabindra bharati university, held an agitation on tuesday against the decision taken to shift the department from its present jorasanko campus to the new campus on b.t. road. as a part of the agitation, they even stopped the admission procedure which was to take place on the same day at the university. all the students of the department unanimously declared that they wanted to stay back at the jorasanko campus for both sentimental and practical reasons. we will not allow them to hold admissions till they meet our demands. no matter what, we will not move out of this campus, said a student. vice-chancellor shubhankar chakraborty, however, was exceptionally cool about the whole affair. speaking of the students preventing admission, he said, we just have to admit 30 students in this department, which is not a big affair. if it has not been possible today, we will take alternative steps tomorrow. and if they still create problems, we may think of organising the admission at our b.t. road office. on possible inconvenience to students due to this shift of campus, he said, they have to come. they have no choice because the transfer has been decided by the executive council. i don't even consider this an issue. an expert council has declared the jorasanko campus unfit for teaching and learning of visual arts due to inadequately lit classrooms and damaged roofs, he added. students complain that the new campus building has just 24 rooms, which are small and dingy. we have a sprawling campus here at jorasanko and it has the right atmosphere for artistic activities. kala bhavan is here and we are extremely attached to this place, said pintu, a visual arts student. the vice-chancellor argues that the b.t. road campus is spread over 27,000 sq. ft, against the 15,000 sq. ft at jorasanko. besides the double-storeyed building which will be used for studying, there is chitra bhavan, which is being built. then there is a furnace here which was not there at jorasanko. the west bengal government has given rs 1 crore for this new campus and another grant to set up computers in order to start new courses in animation and multi-media. these new courses are not possible without optimum space, which is only available at the new campus, chakraborty said. the present vc is least bothered about the sentiment factor of this place, which exudes tagore's ideals and has a charm of its own. he has even referred to our agitation as a criminal act. many of us are here because we want to learn at this place which was closest to tagore's heart, said another student.

23,Ganesha to the aid of drought-hit farmers?,"mysore: just when a farmer and his family members __ frustrated over crop failure due to the drought __ attempt suicide, ganesha comes to their rescue. no, neither was the elephant god sighted, nor did he come to their aid. this is the theme the idol makers of mysore are exploiting to the hilt for ganesh chathurthi, just a week away. the lord, of course, also supplies water __ through his trunk __ to farmers. ``we have not adopted the concept just to boost sale. we believe it is our prayer to lord ganesha to provide adequate rains to farmers,'' says ramaiah, a leading idol maker. among the favourite theme is the famed kbc hosted by amitabh bachchan.``last year, the market was bad due to kidnapping of kannada matinee idol rajkumar by forest brigand veerappan,'' says ramaiah. the plan to employ `kidnap drama' as the theme last year failed as many organisations decided against celebrations as a mark of respect to the veteran actor. idols of sachin tendulkar with his cricket bat, bachchan on the `hot seat', rajkumar seeking blessings from lord ganesha, vajpayee-musharraf blessed by ganesha during talks, and the lord pacifying karunanidhi and jayalalitha are some of the popular themes this year. ``we have not kept idols of celebrities and politicians for sale. it is only to attract customers and to highlight our artistic skills,'' said shivanand, another idol maker. agreeing that the sale of idols is better than last year, he said the festival would be celebrated on a large scale this year. voluntary organisations have booked over 150 ganesha idols measuring more than 12 ft in height, he said.
