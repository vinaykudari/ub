0,Advani may take charge of BJP for 2004 elections,"RAIPUR: A significant change in the BJPâ€™s constitution has fuelled speculation that Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani may be heading back to the party organisation to lead the party to the next general elections.

On Friday evening, the BJP amended its constitution to allow a member to hold the post of president for more than one term, but not consecutively, when it accepted the recommendations of the O P Kohli committee.

The speculation comes in the wake of two recent events : One, the Prime Minister''s annoyance with party president M Venkaiah Naidu who, he felt, had placed a question mark on his leadership when he was abroad at a G-8 meeting by announcing that the BJP would project Vajpayee and Advani equally in the next general elections, the first as Vikas Purush and the latter as Lahau Purush.

At that time, the overwhelming feeling in the BJP was that Vajpayee, who is known to have a long memory, would not forgive him, and Naidu''s days as president were numbered.

Two, at the felicitation function that Naidu organised for the PM to make peace with him, after the latter returned from the foreign tour, Vajpayee had stunned all his listeners when after declaring that the party and government had grown in self-confidence under his leadership, and that he was neither ``tired or retired, he announced that Advani would lead the BJP to victory in the next polls.

At that time, a visibly embarrassed Advani looked on as Naidu rushed to the podium to stress breathlessly that Vajpayee was not just his and Advani''s leader, but also that of the NDA and the nation.

Later, Naidu tried to explain away the PMs statement by saying it did not mean that there would be a change of leadership, only that Advani would be in charge of organisational matters.

Friday''s change in the constitution could make the PMs stated desire as interpreted by Naidu at that time a reality by putting an official stamp on what he has been doing in an informal capacity, party sources said.

Interestingly, officially, too, the party''s functionaries on Saturday chose to dodge a direct reply on whether Advani would be heading back to the party organisation.

Party general secretary Pramod Mahajan, when asked whether Advani could become president again, said, ``Both Vajpayee and Advani can become president again. But did he rule out the possibility of Advani becoming president again? ``I am not ruling out the possibility of anyone becoming president, but my realistic assessment is that Naidu will be made president in November 2003.

Naidu was not ``elected president as he merely replaced Jana Krishnamurthy in mid-course.

The other reason being cited as a reason for Advanis possible return to the party is the fact that the party''s experiments with Bangaru Laxman and Jana Krishnamurthy did not work well, and even Naidu is perceived by many as not being weighty enough to lead the party in a critical election year. Advani''s experience makes him a better bet as president, the PM feels, sources said.

Advani had been president for two consecutive terms of two years each in the late 1980 and early 1990s. Thereafter, the constitution was amended in 1999 in Chennai to allow a member only one three-year term. And it was during Advani''s presidency that the party grew from two to 89 seats in 1989 Lok Sabha and thereafter prospered after he undertook his Ramrath yatra in 1990.

2,Tailors prepare to protest on July 29,"MANGALORE: In view of the lukewarm response of the state government in fulfilling their demands, the Karnataka State Tailors Association (KSTA) will hold a state-wide dharna in Bangalore on July 29.

Lakshman S Ullal, president of KSTA, told reporters here on Friday that the demand for setting up a separate Tailors Welfare Fund tops their list of demands submitted to the government.

Elaborating on the state of affairs of the community, he said that there was a need for a provision of retirement benefits to tailors and the association had expressed its consent to contribute to the corpus fund when created.

Stating that the minister of labour had promised to press for introducing a bill on unorganised sector in the assembly, at Chitradurga last year, he lamented that no favourable action has been taken yet.

He said that the KSTA was formed in 1999, and has members from 22 districts. It has a membership of over 50,000. They have formed many committees which work towards the well being of tailors.

Citing example of a similar struggle by tailors in Kerala, he said that the government there had established a Tailors'' Welfare Fund for the benefit of the community.

The association had organised a postcard movement, on March 28. A rally had been organised from Ullal to Bangalore on March 17 to March 20 and a memorandum was submitted to the minister of state for labour. A draft, Unorganised Workers Development Directive 2002 was then prepared, but, not placed before the Parliament.

Narayan Mendon, president, state committee, Raghuram B., secretary, district committee, B.A. Narayan, vice president, state committee, KSTA were present at the press meet.

3,Student protest drowns Board's claim on results,"KOLKATA: The claim of the West Bengal Council for Higher Secondary Education that this year''s results would be free of errors is increasingly sounding hollow.

A day after HS results were declared, several anomalies are cropping up. A student of Vivekananda Institute, Howrah, who ranked 2500 in JEE, has got a zero in mathematics and failed in physics. The student, who has topped Carmel High School with 895 marks, has scored a shocking 36 in the Bengali second paper.

Many students in Howrah, especially those who had already secured engineering and medicine seats in Joint Entrance Examination (JEE), are devastated by the HS results.

Kaushik Majumdar, a student of Vivekananda Institution, Howrah, was successful in JEE but has failed in physics, chemistry and mathematics. Kaushikâ€™s teachers, who spoke highly of the boy, are at a loss as to how a meritorious student could fail in these subjects. â€œI got 13 and 19 in the two physics papers and 16 and 25 respectively in mathematics. I thought I had done reasonably well in these papers but the results are showing something different. I am shocked. I do not know what to do,â€� said Kaushik.

Shroutapramit Mukherjee of the same school has also ranked in JEE but has scored zero in the mathematics second paper and failed in physics. Avik Dey of Vivekananda Institution and Anudutta Banerjee of Howrah Zilla School are few others who have failed in science subjects despite ranking in the JEE. Several schools have already expressed their dissatisfaction with the results.

Out of 271 students, who appeared for the HS from Carmel High School, about 200 students are planning to send individual papers for reevaluation. â€œThe student who has topped the school with 895 marks has scored merely 36 in the second paper of Bengali,which is absurd. Excellent students have scored very low marks in chemistry, education and English as well,â€� said Carmel principal Sister Ann Imelda, who shot down the claims of fool-proof results by the board.

South Point High School principal Jayati Solomon is unhappy about the marks in the languages papers. She also believes that many students who secured around 50 per cent marks in particular subjects could score better. Some students have scored as low as 35 in English at Modern High School and are completely demoralised. They plan to send their English marks for re-evaluation. â€œMost of us have scored around 90 out of 200 in English with the highest marks being only 107.

With rising admission problems in the best colleges, such discrepancies in marks put a tremendous pressure on us,â€� said MHS student Anansha Roy Chowdhry.

5,No hint on advancing LS polls: EC,"HYDERABAD: The election commission (EC) on Saturday said that it had received neither direct or indirect hint from the government on advancing the Lok Sabha polls.

Speaking to reporters, election commissioner B B Tandon, however maintained that, the EC should get enough time to conduct free and fair polls and added that elections to the Lok Sabha should be conducted in September 2004, as the term of the present Lok Sabha expires in October, according to schedule. Tandon, who is also a member of the Delimitation Commission, was in Hyderabad to hold discussions with the representatives of various political parties on the reconstitution of the Assembly and Parliamentary constituencies.

Tandon said the EC had taken up an exercise to rationalise the polling stations in the country which would be completed by August 31. According to this, no polling station will have more than 1,500 voters and it should not be located more than 2 km away from the residence of the voters of the area. Expressing satisfaction over the progress on issuing photo identity cards to voters, Tandon hoped to complete the process by the middle of September.

However, the EC would not make casting of vote mandatory. The EC also wants to use electronic voting machines (EVMs) all over the country, if the elections to Lok Sabha are held according to the schedule.

6,State forwards SEZ policy to Centre,"KOLKATA: The West Bengal government may not have officially announced its policy for special economic zones (SEZ), but it has quietly informed the Centre that the package offered for the gems and jewellery complex at Salt Lake should be considered as its SEZ policy.

The stateâ€™s response â€” putting at rest speculation that it might not formulate an SEZ policy for fear of a backlash from the trade unions â€” followed a recent query from the Union commerce department on whether the concessions offered by the Left Front government for the jewellery park Mani Kanchan would hold true for other SEZ ventures as well.

State commerce and industry secretary Sabya-sachi Sen told TNN on Saturday that the step was taken so that Mani Kanchan could get formal SEZ recognition from the Centre. â€œWe have told them that we will issue the requisite notifications such as those pertaining to stamp duty exemption and sales tax exemption in a month (for other possible SEZ projects).

Meanwhile, they should consider (the package offered for) Mani Kanchan as our SEZ policy and confer the SEZ status on this venture at the earliest,â€� Sen said.

The state government had let the impression gain ground in some quarters that Mani Kanchan â€” being implemented by the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation â€” was a special case and the concessions it had granted to the project may not be extended to other ventures.

Trade unions have always feared that SEZs would cut into workersâ€™ rights. â€œWe hope that Mani Kanchan would get the SEZ nod within this month,â€� Sen said. The Union commerce department has the final say on whether a project qualifies as an SEZ. But New Delhi can only start the process of conferring SEZ recognition after the state has issued its own notifications in this regard.

The establishment of more SEZs is expected to spur exports from West Bengal and help it meet its ambitious target of attaining a nine per cent share of the countryâ€™s total merchandise exports by 2007.

Sen said the state would announce its export policy next week. Last month, the government had underlined the broad features of this policy. These included the setting up of anexport promotion co-uncil, strengthening the Board of Trade, simplification of procedures and introduction of a market information service.

8,ECR GM feels pinch of people's wrath,"MUZAFFARPUR: The general manager of East Central Railway, Radhe Shyam Varshneya, had to face the pinch of a public agitation on Saturday when he had to leave his train and use the road service to reach Muzaffarpur from Goraul following squatting on the railway track by a group of students of Goraul after some clashes with another group of students.

The GM was coming to attend a seminar on railway safety measures in local North Bihar Chamber of Commerce and Industry.

In his speech, the GM tried to impress upon the rail users that the railway accidents in India were far less compared to mishaps in other parts of the world.

He also gave details of safety measures being adopted in the country and hoped that the steps would definitely check the incidents of derailments. He, however, asked for public cooperation to allow the trains to run smoothly. He also appealed to the public to spare the railway while expressing their wrath against some other incidents.

Local traders demanded some more facilities to railway users, particularly the traders of Muzaffarpur, and advised the railway administration to be more vigilant while implementing safety measures.

There was another rail blockade at Thana Gumti here on Saturday when a section of local women sat on the railway line to protest against the persisting power problem of Muzaffarpur town.

9,Bharti asks govt for additional 5 MHz spectrum,"NEW DELHI: Amid increasing complaints of network congestion and pressures of overcrowding, Bharti Group on Sunday said it has asked the government to allocate additional five MHz spectrum to raise the quality of its service and operations to international levels.

This demand is in addition to the grant of two MHz of spectrum received by the company last week. The Department of Telecom released two MHz of additional spectrum to AirTel. This move will substantially increase its traffic handling capacity in Delhi.

With this, Bharti in Delhi would have 10 MHz of spectrum.

The grant of spectrum comes at a time when Bharti has continued to maintain its lead over rivals, despite the hotting up of cellular competition in the national capital.

The company has hiked its subscriber base to 10.68 lakh in June from 10.06 lakh users in the previous month, according to the latest estimates by Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI).

Zahira, one of the witnesses who turned hostile, has said that she had declined to identify the rioters in the court out of fear. She has pleaded for a retrial, preferably out of Gujarat.

Yasmin said she was present at the bakery at the time of the incident and that Zahira and her mother, Sehrunnissa, were pointing the finger at the wrong people.

She said the 21 accused were never part of the mob. She claimed that the Srivastava cousins, one of them an MLA and the other a municipal councillor, who Zahira alleged had intimidated her, were innocent.

12,Rajasthan govt puts Tijara fort up for sale,"JAIPUR: A two-century old fort known as Tijara fort in Alwar district is being disposed off by the state government. The state government has invited bids for leasing out this fort which is to be converted into a heritage resort.

14,Sister-in-law questions Zahira's credibility,"VADODARA: Zahira Shaikhâ€™s disgruntled sister-in-law Yasmin Banu Shaikh has joined the long list of eyewitnesses of the Best Bakery carnage who have come out in the open and said they would like to tell a court â€œthe real truthâ€�.

Yasmin is the 20-year-old estranged wife of Zahiraâ€™s brother Nafitullah and was present at the bakery when the carnage took place. She alleges that both Zahira and her mother Shehrunissa are lying. According to her, the 21 who were accused and later acquitted by fast-track court judge H U Mahida, were never part of the mob.

Yasmin claims Zahira and Sheherunissa forced her to leave for Chhota Udepur with her uncle, when he came to visit her at the SSG Hospital. â€œThey were afraid that I would speak the truth. So, they sent me away. I now live with my mother and two-year-old daughter Tanvir Banu and survive by working as a domestic help.â€�

Incidentally, Nafitullah is believed to have an illegitimate relationship with a Hindu woman, Kailas Vasava who has changed her name to Heena, from Hanuman Tekri. They also have a child from this relationship.

Yasmin says that she knows Bhattu as he used to regularly frequent the area before the carnage took place, but says she has never met Madhu Shrivastav.
