1,Mayawati govt has lost legal sanction: Mulayam,"CHANDIGARH: Samajwadi Party (SP) president and former defence minister Mulayam Singh Yadav, on Tuesday, reiterated that the BJP-supported BSP government in Uttar Pradesh has lost legal sanction as it is no longer in majority. â€œMayawati is clinging to power using repressive force against her opponents and the MLAs who are against her,â€� said Mulayam while talking to mediapersons during a brief stopover at Chandigarh airport.

Mulayam Singh and party general secretary Amar Singh were returning to Delhi from Hamirpur (HP) where they have entered into a pre-poll agreement with the Himachal Loktantrik Party (HLP) of Thakur Mohinder Singh. As per the agreement SP will contest elections from 40 seats while the HLP will contest from 28 seats.

Coming back to the political scene in UP, Mulayam said the Samajwadi Party will start an agitation against the illegal state government. He also criticised the UP Governor for stating that there was no danger to the government.

â€œEven the home minister LK Advani had accepted that the UP government was in crisis and the governor made such an irresponsible statement,â€� he added. When asked about his reaction to the Congress president Sonia Gandhiâ€™s statement that her party was willing to enter into coalition with other secular parties to defeat the BJP, Mulayam said he would comment on the issue at the right time.

On the recent crackdown on Shiromani Akali Dal activists in the wake of the SGPC elections, Mulayam supported Amarinder for acting to preserve the peace. He also criticised the Haryana government for supporting Badal.

2,Probe sought into arrests of SAD workers,"CHANDIGARH: The Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) on Tuesday sought an inquiry into the alleged illegal mass arrests of workers and supporters of the SAD (B), so that all those who indulged in gross abuse of power could be brought to book. The petition filed through SGPC president Kirpal Singh Badungar has also sought grant of adequate compensation to all those who have suffered due to these arrests.

The writ petition preferred under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India further sought directions to the Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh, home secretary, director general of police and the deputy commissioner, Amritsar to stop the illegal, unconstitutional and indiscriminate arrests of SAD (B) supporters in the state.

Pointing out that a total of 1,222 SAD (B) workers and supporters had been arrested so far, the petitioner further alleged that the arrests were totally malafide and resorted to a strategy to wipe out SAD. An important aspect of this included dethroning the candidates owing allegiance to the SAD (B) and installing persons belonging to the splinter group of the SAD led by Gurcharan Singh Tohra and Ravi Inder Singh. It also referred to a statement of Amarinder Singh that the arrests had been ordered by him to ensure free and fair poll of the SGPC office-bearers. The petitioner further alleged that the pilgrims were evicted from the Golden Temple complex and the sarais attached to it and that they had complained about this in telegrams to the Chief Justice of India, the Prime Minister, the Union home minister and others.

After the submission made by the petitionerâ€™s counsel, chief justice B K Roy and justice Singhvi adjourned the case to November 26 when the state advocate general would make a statement on the subject. Other cases pertaining to the SGPC elections were also adjourned to the same date.

After recording the statement of the Punjab advocate general Harbhagwan Singh that he was informed by Inspector General (security), Punjab, Rajinder Singh, currently in Amritsar, that only necessary steps were taken around the area where the SGPC election was to be held, the bench dismissed the prayer for intervention made in a telegram to the chief justice on Tuesday. It was incorrect to suggest that precautionary measures taken were anyway in excess of the demand of the situation, the advocate general had added.

Punjab ADGP Izhar Alam asked to appear in person: Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel on Tuesday directed Punjab additional director general of prisons, Izhar Alam to be present in the court on December 2 to explain why he did not care to reply to the letters sent by the state counsel about a case pertaining to prisons pending before the high court.

The direction to Izhar Alam came during the resumed hearing on the writ petition filed under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code by Balbir Singh, resident of Panaichan village, Khamano police station, Fatehgarh Sahib district seeking directions to the Punjab government to declare that the action of the official respondents in granting remission in jail terms of private respondents Bahadur Singh, Harbans Singh and Bhura Singh, all sons of Ishar Singh, who had been sentenced to serve two yearsâ€™ prison term and a fine of Rs 2,000 each, as per judgement of the judicial magistrate Ist class, Fatehgarh Sahib under Sections 326, 324, 323 and 34, IPC in a case at police station, as illegal, arbitrary as per the judgement of the Supreme Court of India given last year in the case of state of Haryana versus Mohinder Singh.

Election petition against Haryana MP dismissed: Justice N K Sud of has dismissed the election petition preferred by Randhir Singh of Seharda village, Kaithal district against the victorious Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) candidate Kailsho Devi from the Kurukashetra parliamentary constituency in 1999. The petition has been dismissed on grounds of non-prosecution after the petitioner failed to turn up to pursue the case.

3,YSR puts govt on the mat,"HYDERABAD: The alleged irregularities in the implementation of the Food-for-Work (FFW) scheme and inadequate drought relief measures stalled the proceedings of the Assembly for the second consecutive day on Tuesday with the Congress accusing the government of being indifferent to the farmersâ€™ plight.

Resuming the debate which was adjourned on Monday, Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader Y S Rajasekhara Reddy launched a scathing attack on the government for what he called â€œignoring the pending irrigation projects which resulted in the present drought situation.â€�

â€œThe same government in 1995 promised to take up all pending irrigation projects on a fast track basis by 2000 end, but work has not been initiated on at least a single project so far. This reflects the governmentâ€™s apathy towards the farm sector,â€� the CLP leader said. Rajasekhara Reddyâ€™s speech was interrupted several times by the treasury benches with the ruling party members criticising the CLP leader of â€˜hijacking the rightâ€™ of other members to speak on the drought situation in their respective areas. This led to noisy scenes with the ruling and opposition parties trading charges against each other even as deputy speaker K Harishwar Reddyâ€™s appeals went in vain.

High drama was witnessed in the House when Harishwar Reddy asked the CLP leader to be concise in his speech while the latter shot back claiming that his speech would have been completed had there been no interruptions from the treasury benches. At one stage, Reddy took objection to the deputy speakerâ€™s repeated requests asking him to cut short his speech. â€œInstead you ask us to leave the House and we are prepared to do so,â€� he said.

Continuing his attack on the ruling party, Rajasekhara Reddy said that though foundation stones were laid for several projects like Galeru-Nagari, Handri-Neeva, Devadula, and Veligonda, work on them was yet to commence. â€œEvery time there is an election, chief minister Chandrababu Naidu lays a foundation stone to woo voters, but the projects will be ignored later,â€� he remarked.

Referring to the drought situation, he said that while farmers were already facing crisis, the government has also reduced the prices of milk procurement putting the farmers to hardship. â€œThe reduction of milk prices is only aimed at diluting and privatising the Dairy Development Cooperative Federation. This is amply evident from the fact that the chief minister also manages the Heritage Foods which is continuously making profits,â€� he said.

4,ABVP to hold Chalo Delhi rally on Nov 26,"HYDERABAD: The Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) will organise a ''Chalo Delhi'' rally on November 26 to submit a 58-point charter of demands on educational change and employment to the prime minister.

Their demands include Indianisation of education, enhancing government financial support to education, autonomy to universities, , employment policy for providing jobs to youth and reducing the retirement age in all government services to 58 years.

Announcing this at a press conference on Tuesday, ABVP state secretary K Sudhakar said that they would submit signatures of 25 lakh people from all parts of the country in support of their demands. Nearly 5,000 students from the state would participate in the rall, he said. Sudhakar said that the state unit of ABVP would submit representations to the governor, ministers, MPs and MLAs. Sudhakar also said that efforts were made to make the charter of demands a significant document of educational change and an employment-oriented economic policy.

Sudhakar added that nearly 5,000 students would travel to Delhi from the state by trains on November 24 to participate in the rally. He requested the passengers to put-off their journey to Delhi by express trains such as Dakshin, Andhra Pradesh, Grand Trunk, Tamil Nadu and other trains running between Hyderabad and New Delhi on November 24 and 25.

5,Children’s Day not so sweet in govt schools,"HYDERABAD: Childrenâ€™s Day not so sweet for children studying in government schools as the authorities have no money to buy a few biscuits or even toffees for the students.

Though almost every school gives children at least two toffees or two biscuits, the money for this is got by saving about 25 to 50 paise from every childâ€™s school fee, every year.

â€œThe state government has no such budget provision to give children any such luxuries. Neither on Childrenâ€™s Day nor Independence or Republic Day,â€™â€™ a senior education department told The Times of India. Most times, it is teachers who pay for chocolates that are given to children.

â€œThe children look forward to some kind of gift on Childrenâ€™s Day, because it is supposed to be their day and if they do not get anything, they feel extremely disappointed. So, we try to make up for this,â€™â€™ one of the teachers at a government school at Mehdipatnam said.

In spite of various programmes like Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan and school projects funded by Unicef, the government is unable to put aside money for distribution of sweets, the official said.

â€œIt is extremely difficult for teachers to put aside money from the school fees because the fees for classes-VI and VII is Rs 9 per year and the fees for classes-VIII to is about Rs 20,â€™â€™ the official explained.

This money has to be paid to the District Common Entrance Examination Board for the supply of question papers.

Schools are left with Rs 3 and Rs 10 per student per year. Money has to be managed to buy chalk pieces and dusters, pay cleaners and get repairs done, apart from other expenses.

â€œAt the end of the day, the school or government is left with no money to buy toffees or biscuits for children. Most times it is generous donors, NGOs or social service organisations which sweeten the childrenâ€™s day.

6,Jailbreak cases increase in Bihar,"PATNA: The frequency of jailbreaks is becoming a major embarrassment for the state government. Between January 2000 and August 2002, as many as 22 jailbreaks have taken place in Beur, Motihari, Bettiah, Chapra, Jamui, Rosera, Purnia, Siwan, Sasaram and other jails.

However, junior minister for jails Ashok Choudhary tries to defend himself, ""Though there have been more cases of jailbreaks during my tenure, the number of inmates having escaped is lesser than earlier.""

Admitting that jailbreaks cannot take place without the connivance or negligence of jail staff, he stressed that he had recommended strong disciplinary action against jail staff whenever he felt that they were responsible for the jailbreak.

But, in reality, in several cases action against jail employees is still pending. The departmental report on a jailbreak, which took place on March 18, 2000 at Barh sub-jail, is still awaited.

In case of another jailbreak in Siwan on June 28, 2000, resulting into the escape of four prisoners, the then superintendent of Chapra jail was asked to investigate the case and report on the departmental action to be taken against the jail employees.

""The jail official showed complete lack of interest in carrying out the investigation and the job had to be assigned to another jail official of Sasaram,"" says a jail department document. The report sought from West Champaran DM on a jailbreak, which occurred on January 1, 2002, is still awaited.

In certain cases, like the jailbreak in Jamui on March 11, 2002, as many as 11 prisoners had fled. In Bettiah, on the night of August 10, eight prisoners managed to scale the wall and escape.

One of the most well-known jails of Bihar, Beur Central Jail, has witnessed three jailbreaks in as many years. The jail has gained the reputation of a place where the inmates call the shots.

Repeated raids on the jail premises in the last three years have resulted into recovery of guns, knives, mobile phones, TV sets, drugs and all sorts of restricted items from the inmates.

It''s not only jailbreaks which are a matter of concern. The anarchy witnessed in Bihar jails is stark. Chapra, Ara and Gopalganj jails have witnessed the inmates going on rampage and taking over control of the jail in the past.

In Chapra jail early this year, the police had to force their entry and shoot at inmates for gaining control. In Ara, the revolt was triggered by the dismantling of a kitchen meant for inmates of a particular caste. ""Some one is the past had taken a wrong decision to open a kitchen for a particular caste,"" remarked Choudhary.

Senior jail officials point towards the overcrowding of jails and the slow moving wheels of judiciary as the main reasons for the high number of jailbreaks in Bihar.

""The jails house prisoners more than twice their capacity. Every year, 3,500 more inmates join the crowd. There are undertrials in the jails who are behind the bars for four years for minor crimes,"" remarked an official.

9,"Govt not to recover loans, interest from farmers: PM","NEW DELHI: In a move to alleviate the hardships being faced by farmers following failure of South-West monsoon in different parts of the country, the government has decided not to effect any recovery of crop loan, including interest, during the current financial year, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee said on Wednesday.

""This benefit will cover farmers in the affected areas, including the plantation sector"", Vajpayee said in a statement here.

Stating that the respective state governments would be taking all possible measures to protect the interests of plantation sector, the Centre has now decided to create a corpus of Rs 500 crore, with a substantial contribution from the Centre, apart from the contribution from state governments and a small contribution from the growers, Vajpayee said.

Income from this corpus will be used for providing relief to participating growers when the market conditions were depressed, he said adding that the details of the scheme would be finalised shortly in consultation with the Finance ministry.

Repayment of loans and interest given to coffee growers were being rescheduled upto a maximum of 11 years, he said.

""I want to emphasise that efforts towards modernisation of the processing industry in the plantation sector would get full support from the Central Government,"" the Prime Minister said.

Emphasising that effects of the drought would have to be tackled with ""fortitude, prudence and unitedly until at least May/June 2003"", Vajpayee said that the Centre was determined to do its utmost to minimise farmers'' difficulties.

It was expected that with all these measures, state governments would also be able to gear up the field level machinery and ensure that benefits reached all the farmers, he said.

10,Advani denies split in govt over privatisation,"NEW DELHI: Making light of the controversy over disinvestment, Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani has said that views on the mode of privatisation cannot be called ""differences"" within government.

He said in an interview to PTI that the Kelkar Taskforce recommendations on tax reforms were only a consultation paper to elicit public opinion and not a government decision yet.

To a question on differences within the government on disinvestment policy, Advani said, ""There are no differences.""

""Just because there are two views on the disinvestment of the two oil companies (Hindustan Petroleum and Bharat Petroleum), it cannot be said there are differences,"" he added.

Even those who were committed to liberalisation and disinvestment had two views on the mode of privatisation through strategic route, Advani said.

To present this as differences within the government was not proper, he said, adding that government had been pursing the disinvestment policy for the last four years.

On Kelkar''s reforms on which even sections of BJP had expressed reservations, the Deputy Prime Minister said he had a brief discussion with Finance Minister Jaswant Singh.

He said he had not gone through the recommendations yet and that the Finance Minister himself was not in agreement with some of the things mentioned in the report.

11,BJP convenes legislature party meet on Nov 17,"LUCKNOW: UP BJP legislature party has convened a meeting on November 17, a day before the crucial Vidhan Parishad by-election, in which a whip is likely to be issued asking party legislators to vote in favour of BSP-BJP coalition candidate Munna Singh Chauhan.

Former minister Yashwant Singh, fielded by dissident BJP legislators, will lock horns with Chauhan in a straight fight.

12,BJP flays Mufti for releasing political prisoners,"AMRITSAR: The BJP on Wednesday attacked the PDP-Congress government in Jammu and Kashmir for releasing political prisoners and accused it of halting all anti-terrorist operations in the state saying these would affect the morale of the security forces.

Charging the Congress with being hypocritical, party president M Venkaiah Naidu said, ""on the one side Congress strongly condemns all forms of terrorism while on the other side, it is extending unconditional support to its partner PDP, which is releasing terrorists with impunity"".

Describing the release of prisoners by the Mufti government as unfortunate, Naidu said, ""PDP was doing it in reciprocation, as during the State Assembly elections many hard core terrorist organisations allegedly extended support to the PDP.""

Criticising the Congress for playing ""second fiddle"" to the PDP and ""blindly supporting"" its every action ""only with an eye to remain in the power,"" he said that the Congress had always ""played with the national interest with the sole motive of coming to power. It even does not hesitate to boost terrorism in its nasty power snatching game.""

Naidu alleged that the state government had halted all anti-terrorist operations and ""will certainly bring down the morale of security forces who relentlessly waged a war to fight terrorism without even caring for their lives."" PTI

Strongly condemning the recent communal riots in Gujarat, Vaidya said, â€œThe most unfortunate thing is that communal forces and parties are justifying these riots, and hoping that these acts will help them win the elections.â€�

Former president K.R. Narayanan, who was chief guest at the function, also appealed against intolerance and caste and communal violence.

About the poll campaign, Vaidya said RSD workers will tour each and every district in Gujarat. â€œIf Gujarat votes communal forces out of power, it will send the right message across the nation â€” the common man does not support violence in the name of religion,â€� Vaidya said.

Pointing out that the RSD, founded in 1941, had played a vital role in the Indian freedom struggle, Vaidya said, â€œEven after independence, our workers successfully led movements to free Hyderabad and Goa. Similarly, now, we have to take on communal forces in the country.â€�

In his speech, former president Narayanan praised RSD for inculcating the spirit of nationalist among the youth.

Congratulating the 15,000- odd school students, belonging to the schools run by the RSD, who had come to attend the two-day meet, Narayanan said, â€œYou will be the makers of a new India because the values of secularism, tolerance and democracy have been imbibed in you.â€�

Former Union finance minister Madhu Dandavate, who has not been keeping well, surprised everyone by attending the function.

Dandavate, however, said that he was in pain till yesterday, when he was confined in a hospital in Mumbai. â€œToday I am very happy to attend the function organised on the eve of birth anniversary of our leader late S.M. Joshi,â€� he said.

Earlier, former MP and chairman of the reception commi-ttee Vitthal Tupe welcomed the guests. Rashtra Seva Dal to fight communal forces in polls Organisers of gala outdoor events never seem to give a thought to little children participating in the pageantry.

At the RSD diamond jubilee meet, children as young as nine years were made to perform aerobic exercises under the scorching sun at 2.45 pm to accord a grand welcome to former president K.R. Narayanan.

The function went on for an hour and the children drew applause for their energetic displays, but the organisers eventually admitted it had been too hard on the little ones. â€œOriginally we had scheduled the event for 4 pm, but since the dignitaries had to leave for Delhi, it was rescheduled,â€� a senior office-bearer said.

24,SHSAD to move court over SGPC polls,"LUDHIANA: Sarb Hind Shiromani Akali Dal led by Gurcharan Singh Tohra will move the high court seeking cancellation of the SGPC elections held at Amritsar on Tuesday.

Stating this on Wednesday, SHSAD leader and former minister, Mahesh Inder Singh Grewal told mediapersons that the Shiromani Akali Dal led by Parkash Singh Badal had resorted to corrupt and unfair practices to win the SGPC elections.

He said that the way Badal kept the SGPC members as ''hostage'' for over two weeks in his farm house at Balasar in Haryana, amounted not only to ''corruption but criminal intimidation'' also.

""Even if the members had stayed willingly, during any election you are not allowed to provide baits to the voters, not to speak of five star hospitality extended by Badal to the SGPC members,"" said Grewal.

He also alleged that the way members were taken from Balasar to Delhi and then airlifted to Amritsar in a chartered flight was an indication of the highest level of corruption.

25,EC asks Gujarat govt to ban VHP yatra,"NEW DELHI: The Election Commission (EC) on Wednesday directed the Gujarat government to prevent the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) from proceeding with its plan for a statewide ''yatra'' from Friday.

The VHP had earlier announced that it would take out a yatra from Godhra which would culminate in Ahmedabad on December 6, the 10th anniversary of the demolition of the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya.

The unanimous decision of all three EC members - chief J M Lyngdoh, T S Krishnamurthy and B B Tandon - was taken at a full meeting with their deputies here after their return from a two-day visit to the state.

The commission had got a report on the VHP plan from state government officials, who had clearly said that law and order problems on the VHP''s proposed route were probable.

The EC noted this report and the VHP plan to use lookalikes of the Sabarmati Express coach burnt on February 27 at Godhra, besides the ""likelihood of intemperate speches being made during the course of the yatra"". So, it said, it had decided that the proposed yatra should not be allowed.

""Any activity,"" added the Commission, ""which may aggravate existing differences or create mutual hatred, disharmony, illwill etc between different communities... will not only vitiate the election process... but will also seriously jeopardise the law and order situation conducive for the conduct of free and fair elections"" in the violence-hit state.

Hence, it directed the state government to take ""all such measures under existing laws at its disposal to prevent any such yatra, procession, etc, and (any) display and use of such images, etc, as may incite communal tensions and passions and disrupt law and order"".

It ordered similar ""preventive and punitive action"" to be taken against any person or group making ""provocative speeches, posters and pamphlets that incite communal tensions"".
