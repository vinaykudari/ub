0,HC dubs Bihar govt 'heartless',"PATNA: Observing that the Bihar government was ""heartless"", the Patna High Court on Friday pilloried the state government for not initiating steps for early disbursement of Rs 50 crore deposited in the court for distribution among the employees of 19 sick public sector undertakings.

""The employees of these closed PSUs are dying of hunger. Their children are being deprived of celebrating festivals for want of money. But, the state government is sitting pretty and not even providing office and secretariat staff to a three-member committee constituted by the court for the disbursement of money among the staff. It appears the state government has become heartless,"" a Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Ravi S Dhavan and Justice Shashank Kumar Singh observed.

When registrar general of the court informed the Bench that the state''s chief secretary, K A H Subramanian, felt a meeting between the chief minister and the Chief Justice could resolve the issue, Dhavan asked the registrar general to convey to the CS that he was prepared for talks with the chief minister anytime and anywhere.

""I am spending sleepless nights because of the plight of the employees,"" he said.

1,Has govt kicked off a storm in GU?,"AHMEDABAD: Those who have been following the tepid proceedings in Gujarat University for years are surprised at sudden spurt of activities in its corridors, with a spate of inquiries, suspensions and controversies having rocked the varsity.

The big question, say sources, is whether the government has kicked off a storm in the university to remove vested interests'' or make it one of the power centres.

Ostensibly, the government has done the creditable job of flushing pro V-C KS Shastri and his men out and has replaced them with its own men. A look at members of the GU executive council would show that besides Patel and pro V-C Chaitanya Khambholja, five of the other 12 members are BJP men. These include Jagdish Bhavsar, Jayesh Thakkar, Gautam Shah, Amit Thakar and Kaushik Jain.

Out of the other seven, Narhari Amin, vice-president of the National Institute of Co-operative Management, and Sudhir Nanavati, director of the GLS School of Business Administration, are known Shastri opponents.Others are happy to flow with the tide.

Educationists say that though Shastri''s stranglehold on the university has slackened, there is no trace of any educational reforms which the university is very badly in need of. The result is that one hears more about the university instituting inquiries and setting up committees than formulating educational policies.

""Look at the way examination papers are set and assessed. The way marks are being manipulated and results rigged. If the government really wants to bring in reforms in the university, it should concentrate on setting higher educational benchmarks and elevating the quality of education instead of settling scores,"" says an academician on the condition of anonymity.

2,LF to meet for rally consensus,"KOLKATA: The beleaguered Left Front, on Sunday, will attempt chalk out a consensus on holding rallies in the city.

Front partners are also keen put their views forward at the crucial meeting.

Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has been holding discussions with the various partners for the past few days.

On Saturday, he held a meeting with RSP members, while on Friday he discussed his proposals with CPI men.

Bhattacharjee, it is learnt, had already submitted a note the Front on his plan for imposing restrictions on meetings and processions in the city.

Sundayâ€™s meeting will be presided over by Front chairman Biman Bose.

It will decide on the number of proposals on rallies the Front would accept.

On October 29, the chief minister will chair a meeting of all political parties, on the issue.

The Trinamul Congress, however, criticised the move to first discuss the proposals at the Left Front meeting.

It wants the state government to take the opposition parties in to confidence.

They also want a copy of the background paper on the October 29 meeting, so that they can come prepared to the meeting.

Bhattacharjeeâ€™s note, according to Front sources, wants big meetings to be restricted to the Brigade Parade Ground, hahid Minar Maidan and Rani Rashmoni Road.

Smaller meetings can be held at Deshabandhu Park in north Kolkata and Deshapriya Park in the south.

The chief minister also wants to restrict processions through the city. Rallyists arriving from Sealdah station can move via AJC Bose Road and S.N.Banerjee Road and those from Howrah station can move along Rabindra Sarani.

The chief minister is also determined that processions should move along one side of the carriageway.

4,RSS readies election cadre for BJP,"NEW DELHI: The RSS model of organisational training and deployment would be replicated by its most successful affiliate, the BJP, in the coming general polls. In what has been termed Mission 2004, the BJP has decided to deploy chunav sahayaks or election assistants in most of the assembly segments of the country.

There would be roughly six such assistants in every Lok Sabha constituency. The man-in-charge of the project is Bal Apte, an old hand in Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad â€” the RSS student wing. Apte has been recently made the BJP vice president in charge of training. He is still a central executive committee member of the RSS and also a BJP Rajya Sabha member.

Of the 1,500 assistants recruited for 12 states, there is not a single woman and the party does not foresee inviting women into the rough and tumble of organising elections â€” from overseeing electoral rolls to booth management during polling. Another 1,500 or so assistants would be taken in shortly. Apte told The Times of India that â€˜â€˜earlier people used to come out during the last two months of elections to work for the party. Now we have decided to deploy election assistants to work in every constituency for a year without remuneration.

They will work away from their home constituency but in the same state.â€™â€™ An assistant is roughly comparable to the RSSâ€™s vistarak, a person who has been to the first year of the organisationâ€™s officer training course (OTC) â€” a wholetimer but only a trainee pracharak. These assistants, mostly graduates aged between 25 and 35, are not novices and are largely from the ABVP. But Apte refused to make a guess as to how many of them have the RSSâ€™s OTC training or attended an RSS shakha or are from the ABVP.

â€˜â€˜None of my 72 assistants in the north east has seen a shakhaâ€™â€™, he said. Every state would have a convenor for the assistants who would report to the organising secretary of the BJPâ€™s state unit who is invariably an RSS pracharak. And every assistant would have to report to the partyâ€™s Lok Sabha constituency-incharge.

Apte, party office-bearers like Sanjay Joshi and Pyarelal Khandelwal have last month held training classes for the convenors,who along with state unit office bearers would hold training camps for the assistants. â€˜â€˜The political training is not just about sustaining power in Delhi, but also to establish the change that has been effected through the government in the Centre. So, we give an orientation course in ideology, nationalism and the gains made by the party and the government,â€™â€™ said Apte.

5,Ex-minister sees plot behind excise raid,"PATNA: Bad luck seems to be haunting RJD legislator Ramashray Sahni for past two years. Stripped of his cabinet minister status because of a non-bailable warrant against him, he has now to face the humiliation of his son-in-law who was caught drinking liquor at a hotel on the premises of Sahniâ€™s official residence.

On Wednesday evening, excise department officials had conducted raid at the hotel. Though Sahniâ€™s son-in-law was let off after being fined, three others are still in jail.

â€œIt is a conspiracy against me. My son-in-law is not a fool to drink liquor in such a hotel,â€� said the ex-minister. He said that the hotel serves meals only.

â€œTrying to earn a living through hard work is no crime,â€� he said and added that the hotel had existed even before he was allotted the house at Mangles Road.

â€œYou can ask about me from my poor neighbours. All of them will say that I am a â€˜Sadhuâ€™. My house gives shelter to the toiling masses,â€� he claimed.

He denied that he received any monthly rent from the hotel owner. Rumours are doing the rounds that the hotel is being run by Sahniâ€™s son-in-law. However, Sahni denied it.

The premises and garages of several legislators and even ministers are being used for commercial purposes. Even the Patna High Court had asked for a report on the issue.

6,Gay rights NGOs unite against archaic laws,"KOLKATA: A few months after they took out a historic rally in Kolkata, the first of its kind anywhere in India, several NGOs constituted for and by gays in West Bengal, have launched an united ''action programme'', to create awareness among gays about health hazards and at the same time, take on the archaic laws like Section 377 of the IPC which still regards homosexuality as a crime.

The newly formed forum called MANAS Bengal has its job cut out: to co-ordinate efforts of organisations working to promote health and well-being of males who have sex with males(MSM), while taking up their cause with the authorities.

Speaking to TNN, one of the senior-most social activists from the state fighting for gay rights, Pawan Dhall, said, ""The need to unite to tackle the problem of harassment of gays, reached a crunchpoint when a few months ago, two of our outreach workers in Kolkata were assaulted by the local youth. While the agency itself faltered in taking legal action, the police too did not do anything despite a written complaint.""

But as news of the recurring attacks spread by internet, several NGOs got together. A satellite meeting was held in New Delhi during an international sexual health conference and finally seven NGOs from the state including Saathii, Praajak, PLUS and Amitie got together to form MANAS (MSM Advocacy Network for Social Action).

""While the main area of MANAS will be to facilitate and frame guidelines for research and to work out a common policy on sensitising and creating awareness among agencies and homosexuals, it will also take up activities related to information and documentation of human rights violations,"" said a founder member of the newly formed association.

Not willing to be named, the member added, that one of the major issues that they would take up urgently was the immediate amendment to section 377 of the IPC which still considered same sex intercourse as a criminal offence punishable with a life sentence.

""Unless such archaic laws are done away with, we cannot expect to change the mindset of the people at large. Most developed nations today no longer treat us as criminals. Itâ€™s not sympathy we are looking for, but understanding. People need to accept things as they are,"" he said.

8,Crackdown on political hoardings,"NEW DELHI: In the build-up to the assembly poll, the axe has finally fallen on the hoardings of politicians, dotting city roads.

Besides removing several in the last three days, the election department has directed sub-divisional magistrates (SDMs) to survey their areas and submit a daily report. Chief electoral officer Arun Goyal said, ""We have set up control rooms all over the city to monitor the situation. We are even monitoring specific areas so that no new one comes up.""

The SDMs have been reporting the day''s events to the Delhi election office every evening. A senior election official said, ""Though we have written to the civic bodies, the onus of getting them removed lies on the area SDMs as they are the returning officers for the poll.""

The NDMC has already received a letter from the BJP, stating with their removal, no illegal ones will come up.

The West Bengal Prevention of Defacement of Property Act, 1976, has been extended to Delhi and this time the Delhi election office has given strict instructions to ROs to ensure its strict application.
