0,"Improve your public image, home minister to police","hyderabad:home minister t devender goud has asked the police to strive to improve the credibility of the department among the public. ""there is a gap between the people's expectations and police performance. we must address this issue, the home minister said, while addressing a meeting of senior police officers at andhra pradesh police academy here.the meeting, part of retreat-2001, is being attended by about 100 police officers from different parts of the state. goud said the police force should improve its interface with the public. only then can the police department gain the confidence of the people, he pointed out. listing out what the public expect from the police, the home minister, in his 60-minute power-point presentation, said the police should be concerned about the problems faced by people and try to help them within a reasonable time-frame. the retreat-2000, held last year, has set certain goals to be achieved in a year's time. though the police department could not achieve complete results, the home minister said it succeeded in making a good beginning in changing the behavioural pattern of the personnel. goud also wanted police officers to fight the increasing rate of urban crimes, extortions, land cases, faction feuds, and gender offences. he called for a revamp of cid and other specialised investigation wings. director general of police h j dora asked the police officers to maintain public order and identify core issues concerning the department. he said the police officers should work as a team and achieve the desired results. the dgp later gave a presentation on 'leadership — some modern concepts.' principal secretary (home) bharat chandra, in his address, said the department needs to study the emerging social order and its repercussions on society. appa director a k mohanty explained the need for holding the annual retreat conferences for the senior police officers in the state.

6,SAD hand can't be ruled out: Amarinder,"amritsar: apprehending the garhshankar explosion as the handiwork of elements inimical to the congress election campaign, punjab pradesh congress committee president amarinder singh has demanded from home minister lal krishan advani to issue a statement pinpointing the groups behind the gory incident that has once again threatened revival of terrorism in the state. amarinder was talking to mediapersons here on friday. ''why the incidents of terrorism often take place during the polls. during the majitha by-election, statements of wassan singh zaffarwal were distributed which tantamount to indirect threat to the electoral process in the region,'' he said. he did not rule out the possibility of involvement of the ruling party in the state in the blast. ''only a party which is likely to lose in the elections can indulge in such a practice, winner need not disrupt the environment,'' he said. amarinder claimed that people of punjab needed change in governance but added that the congress did not have any magic wand that would undertake development in a jiffy. far sighted and long-term economic policies had to be worked out to replenish the fiscal deficit of the sad-bjp combine government, he said. about dissension among party workers, he said the congress had warned of strict action against anyone found working against the official candidate of congress. about the recent landmine blast incidents, he said any civilian's land being used for defence purposes should be duly compensated for.

8,The party wanted me to contest against CM: Mehta,"rajkot: forced into the congress electoral politics, ashwin mehta, the candidate for the rajkot-2 assembly constituency, seems to be the right man in the wrong place. he is pitted against chief minister narendra modi and the fight looks like that of david and goliath. a banker by profession, mehta is also connected with some educational institutions. though a congressman for the past two decades, mehta has yet to contest a district panchayat election and was presently struggling to keep himself afloat in the turbulent waters of the congress party in rajkot city. in a candid interview to this correspondent, mehta confessed, ""i am not a man of electoral politics, but am contesting because the high command wanted me to contest against modi."" excerpts from the interview: q: how do you rate narendra modi as a candidate? a: i have better chances than modi, who is an outsider. also, i am a resident of rajkot and have seen the city grow. besides, being a local, i have my business and social circle in this place, which would be advantageous for me in the campaigning. i can read the pulse of rajkot better than modi. you were never in the race for the rajkot-2 seat. now that you are in the ring, how do you feel? it is right that i am not a man of electoral politics, but i was asked by none other than the party president sonia gandhi to go for it. i have accepted the decision in right earnest. though elections are not new to me, i am not used to active politics as i have always supported my party's candidates. elections are not my cup of tea. how prepared are you for a sabarmati-type upset in rajkot-2? we can do it. the congress party is all geared to ambush modi in rajkot -2. the entire party machinery is in top gear and with my contacts as a banker and my own friend circle would also help me in getting to know the people in a better way. besides, i am connected with educational institutions and child welfare, and this would be an added advantage for me. i am confident that we would be able to create a sabarmati-type upset and there is no better opportunity than this. what are your views on the congress infighting in the city unit? there is no infighting in the city unit of the congress party. there are some difference of opinions that exists in every democratic party. moreover, there is no difference of opinion as far as my candidature is considered. even if there is difference of opinion in the local unit, there is scope for sorting it out through discussions. what would be your priorities for rajkot and more particularly for rajkot-2 constituency? the first and foremost problem is that of a permanent solution to the water supply situation. the city and its development has suffered for want of water. till date, no work has been done to permanently solve the drinking water problem. even the industrial growth has suffered for want of water. also, i would like to bring the high court bench to rajkot, which is in the heart of saurashtra, and it is becoming increasingly difficult for people to go all the way to ahmedabad for a hearing. i would also work towards removal of octroi from all the six municipal corporations, as trade and commerce has suffered after octroi was removed from the municipalities and nagarpalikas. what scenario do you see if you win and modi looses? if the chief minister is defeated, i feel that it would be the moral duty of the chief minister to dissolve the house and order fresh elections. and i am confident of such a scenario soon.

9,DF govt violating code of conduct: EC,"mumbai: the election commission has expressed strong displeasure at the way the democratic front government is dispensing election-eve sops in violation of the code of conduct.regularising the height of mumbai slums up to 14 feet and restoration of power supply to 36 lakh defaulters were two such announcements made on the eve of elections to 10 municipal corporations (february 10) and 28 zilla parishads and 308 panchayat samitis (february 17).the commission on thursday wrote to state chief secretary v. ranganathan, objecting to the recent announcement by state energy minister padamsinh patil that power supply connections to 36 lakh consumers in residential, commercial, industrial and agricultural sectors will be restored.the maharashtra state electricity board (mseb) had disconnected power supply to 36 lakh consumers who had failed to pay their dues to the board.the minister had tried to intervene in this case and had orally instructed the mseb officials to restore the power supply. the oral request was turned down by the mseb authorities, who insisted that written instructions should be given from mantralaya.dr patil, however, had refrained from issuing any such instructions but conveniently declared at a press conference that the government would restore the power connections to the consumers.senior officials in the state election commission said that the announcements clearly flouted the code of conduct, and would directly impact elections to the local-self-government bodies.the commission has instructed the state government to restore power supply to consumers only in the scarcity-hit areas.``this is the second such occasion where the state authorities have failed to observe the code of conduct. earlier, they had announced the decision to regularise the height of mumbai slums to 14 ft without consulting us,'' an officer in the commission said.however, while decisions which would influence the poll prospects of the ruling parties have been announced without the commission's consent, the requests for trivial permissions are on the rise.the state authorities have apparently written to the state election commission asking approval for holding dinner banquets for foreign delegates attending the international film festival in mumbai.

10,Rajnath warns violence-mongers,"mohanlalganj: the up chief minister rajnath singh on friday served stern warning against those hell-bent on spreading violence to create disruption in the peaceful conduct of the forthcoming assembly elections and said that such elements would be dealt with an iron hand. addressing a huge election rally here, the cm said people need not feel terrorised in any manner and exercise their voting rights without any fear. in situation of intimidation, they should immediately inform the district administration, which he said had already been asked to deal with such a situation. ""we are committed to hold free and fair elections and booth capturing will not be allowed by anybody,"" he said. the cm's presence here lent a new colour to the campaigning in this reserved constituency where the bjp-supported candidate and leader of lok parivartan party rk chaudhary is locked in a straight contest against the samajwadi party (sp) candidate. chaudhary, a former minister, has won twice on the bahujan samaj party (bsp) ticket from this constituency. but this time, he had to take help from the bjp after he had been shown doors by mayawati. naturally then, criticising mayawati has become an easy way for chaudhary to gain public sympathy. he explained to them that how the movement of the underdogs had been spoilt by mayawati, thanks to her whims and fancies. ""i earned her ire because i opposed her style of functioning,"" chaudhary tries to impress particularly the people belonging to scheduled castes, whose population is sizable in this constituency. his efforts were complemented by cm, who trained his guns against the samajwadi party by accusing it of resorting to propaganda and creating fear psychosis in the minds of minorities to exploit them as vote bank. ""the sp depends on its money power and the bjp on its toil and sincerity,"" the cm said and added it was for the electorate to choose between the two. he then quickly added that the history and record of the sp was there for everyone to remember that it was the party which had plunged up into a series of violence during its regime and derailed the development process. the cm also assured the electorate that rk chaudhary had worked hard for the development of the area as minister in the past and would be made minister again, if the bjp was voted to power. enumerating the achievements of his governments, he said that it had fulfilled around 700 out of total 750 promises made by him during the last one year. and these promises would have a far reaching impacts on the well-being of the people, as they had been covered under various welfare schemes. he said he would further push the development programme, if comes to power again.

11,Big B's 'apolitical' shows for SP: Cong cries foul,"new delhi: the congress betrayed signs of worry on friday over filmstar amitabh bachchan''s role in the samajwadi party''s election campaign in uttar pradesh. in its first official reaction to bachchan''s open support to the sp, congress general secretary ambika soni dashed off a letter to the election commission complaining about the blood donation camps and other charity programmes being attended by the filmstar in the presence of samajwadi party leaders mulayum singh yadav and amar singh. according to the congress, organising such functions during an election campaign was clearly against the election code of conduct and urged the ec to ""take action to curb such activities."" bachchan, who is reportedly deeply indebted to amar singh for bailing him out from a financial crisis, has accompanied singh and yadav to various places in up to plead their case before the electorate. bachchan, however, has maintained that he is not campaigning for the sp but is merely attending philanthropic functions like blood donations camps and distribution of artificial limbs. two such camps were recently inaugurated by bachchan in etawah and bareilly where the superstar took the opportunity to do a little song-and-dance number for the ecstatic crowds while making emotional references to his friends and brothers - amar singh and mulayum. bachchan is slated to attend a series of such functions in up in the run-up to the coming assembly poll. soni, in her letter, stated that though these camps are being organised in the name of ngos, they are being used by top sp leaders to gain political mileage for their party. soni''s letter is not just an indication of the congress party''s concern about how bachchan''s ""campaign"" will help the sp in the polls. it is also a reflection of the extent to which relations between the bachchans and the gandhis have deteriorated. amitabh was a personal friend of rajiv gandhi and a frequent visitor to their residence. he was the congress mp from allahabad during rajiv''s prime ministership. the two families have had a bitter falling out in the recent past though the reasons for this are not known. the fact that the letter to the ec is written by ambika soni, who is also incharge of the congress president''s office, is a clear sign it was written at sonia gandhi''s behest. several congress leaders, however, are questioning the need for sending off such a letter. they termed it as an overreaction and an unnecessary move, saying the congress should have ignored bachchan''s role as it only indicated mulayum''s weakness that he had to rope in the star to campaign for his party in his own backyard.

13,Move to sell ITDC hotel irks Bihar govt,"patna: the indian tourism development corporation-run hotel pataliputra ashok located at the gardiner road is on sale. tenders have already been invited for its sale which, the bihar government claims, is in violation of the lease with the revenue and land reforms department done way back in 1972. as per the lease agreement, bihar government had allotted a piece of 1.5 acres of prime land to the centre, free of cost, for setting up a tourist information centre on august 11, 1972. the agreement further said that if the centre does not want to run it at any point of time, the land should be returned to the revenue department. however, without obtaining any prior permission from the bihar government, centre has decided to put this hotel on sale, said minister of state for tourism suresh paswan in patna on friday. lotus nicco, a new delhi-based private entrepreneur, has purchased another itdc-run hotel at bodh gaya at the cost of rs 2.10 crore. this hotel is spread over an area of 4.8 acres of land . present valuation of the land has been estimated at the rate of rs 15 lakh per katha. the minister alleged that the centre had not consulted the state government before inviting tender for its sale. all these prime lands have been put on sale at a very low rate. we'll not tolerate it any more, the minister said. lord buddha's statue: meanwhile, the state government has planned to construct a 500-ft high statute of lord buddha at bodh gaya.

14,Govt drafts rules banning human cloning,"new delhi: with genetic research growing as an area of immense interest, the government has decided to put rules in place. as a first step, it has decided not to permit any attempts at human cloning. even gene therapy is to be undertaken when it is the only option left or is proven to be better than the existing options. this has been stated in a set of regulations drafted by a committee constituted by the department of bio- technology. the committee with representatives from scientific, educational as well as medical institutions, came up with the final recommendations under the chairmanship of honorary advisor to the manipal academy of higher education m s valiathan. as genetic research comes up with promising cures for diseases and vaccines, new drug targets and the unravelling of the human genome throw open several exciting opportunities, it also becomes necessary to balance these developments with the need for ethics, consent and confidentiality. so, the committee has laid down ethical policies to be followed in genetic research as well as dealt with future issues of benefit-sharing on genetic material obtained from individuals or communities and intellectual property rights. the human genome, or any human material in its natural state, it says, cannot become the subject of a direct financial gain. however, if any commercial use were to be made of the biological samples, appropriate benefit-sharing agreements would need to be made. in any case, human material is to be collected for research only after taking adequate informed consent, even if it is obtained as part of a clinical procedure. a dead foetus or an aborted embryo too cannot be used for genetic research without taking the consent of the parents, say the rules. informed consent is necessary also when collecting samples for dna banking or for cell-line transformation of the biological material. in addition, any dna or cell-line repository would need to have its own ethical review committee to be able to assess each issue. all patents filed in the country or abroad would need to disclose the source of the material so as to protect the economic interests of the original source.

17,SP promises development,"lucknow: samajwadi party (sp) president mulayam singh yadav has charged the bjp and the bahujan samajwadi party (bsp) with selling election ticket to candidates for amounts varying from rs 15 lakh to rs 1.5 crore. releasing the poll manifesto of his party on friday, he alleged that the two parties had given tickets to mafias, criminals and goons as booth-capturing was their prime consideration. on the ayodhya issue, while the sp manifesto states it would go by the rule of law, mulayam singh yadav preferred to stay silent. pledging a development-oriented government, he spoke of an austerity programme to save the state exchequer. the party manifesto too promises 'dignity to the underprivileged'' and ''equanimity'' to all sections of society. the manifesto says the sp would set up a special cell within two months of its assuming power to free the state from mafia and goonda elements. the party also proposes setting up of a special police force and rapid action force to avert any communal riots in muslim-dominated localities.

18,Stars promise an election pot-boiler,"new delhi: all the cinema halls in rampur went begging for audience the day amitabh bachchan turned up with wife jaya to endorse 'bade bhai' mulayam singh yadav and 'chhote bhai' amar singh. but will the crowds translate into votes for samajwadi party? ''we will be in a majority,'' says amar singh with enviable confidence. why, then, does he say, ''mr bachchan's presence in up is not a political yatra?'' amar singh may deny it, but this time around, his party is the one boasting all the star names. ajay devgan and kajol, sridevi and boney kapoor, besides of course the first couple of bollywood and in-house campaigner raj babbar. on the other hand, bjp is trying to make up for shatrughan sinha's absence by getting hema malini to endorse its men and its action, in up as much as in punjab, where vinod khanna is already logging long hours. ''there's no denying it,'' says maya singh of bjp. ''the stars are drawn into the campaign to pull in the crowds who are the king-makers at election time.'' but it is not necessarily the party bosses who approach the stars. ''hema malini herself expressed a desire to campaign,'' explains the bjp general secretary. ''and surely she volunteered because her thinking, belief, ideology coincides with ours.'' likewise, dilip kumar's personal inclination — moulded by his distaste for shiv sena, which has every now and then targeted the actor — decided his choice of congress. at times, however, personal expediency rules the roost, film industry insiders point out. ''because bal thackeray helped out sanjay dutt during his tada trial, sunil dutt refrained from campaigning for congress,'' points out a distributor. ''and rajesh khanna came into politics to clear his income tax problems,'' recalls another, ''as did jaya prada in the south.'' ""neither my wife sridevi nor anyone else in my family have been approached to campaign,'' says bollywood producer boney kapoor. ''but if amar singh asks me, i would certainly extend moral support from a public platform,'' he stoutly adds. kapoor would do so not for any political reason but only to repay the ''gracious help and guidance he (singh) extended us when we set out to shoot pukar in kashmir.'' in a way, it's the same story with ajay devgan, who, it is common knowledge within film industry, was bailed out by amar singh ''when he ran into trouble while shooting raju chacha.'' and amitabh bachchan, who gave up congress to return to cinema, has again hit the campaign trail to repay the ''tactical support'' he received from amar singh and sahara when abcl went into the red. for many other netas, especially down south, politics offered an alternative career when they'd crossed their prime meridien. ''it was the logical end to the film careers of mgr, ntr, karunanidhi, sivaji ganesan and jayalalithaa,'' says a political commentator of long standing.

19,A second political coming for the Bachchans?,"new delhi: it's a double role of the kind the bollywood icon has never essayed before: one moment, amitabh bachchan vehemently denies every suggestion about his return to active politics. in the next, he hits the campaign trail to rustle up support for mulayam singh yadav's samajwadi party all around uttar pradesh. of course, the big b has been careful about the fig-leaf of non-political organisations inviting him to address the crowd from their platforms. so, he has been hopping from one bar association reception to another rotary club felicitation, presiding over blood donation camps and welfare events to distribute artificial limbs for the handicapped. often accompanied by wife jaya and sp bosses mulayam and amar singh in tow, he has been telling audiences for the past few weeks about the ''greatness'' of the two. what could have prompted the ageing star to beat the dusty trails in rural up apart from his personal gratitude to sp leaders? both mulayam and amar are quick to point to the ruse of the apolitical nature of amitabh's campaign. however, observers see hints of a larger design and future moves in amitabh's second coming to up's electoral arena after a long 17 years. after his epochal 1984 against opposition stalwart, the late h n bahuguna, only troubles courted him. disillusioned, he resigned from lok sabha half way through his term. but the bachchans have not really been away from politics. through gestures, subtle understatements, by their associations, the clan has made clear its propensity to politics. there is talk, already, in samajwadi circles of bachchan finally dropping the political anchor at a future date. if not amitabh then it is jaya, the wags want the world to know. such talk could just be mere froth of the campaign tides. but for the first couple of cinema, perhaps it is an idea worth considering particularly when they have what matters most in a democracy — the pied piper's magic tune to lure the multitude.
