0,"Peace, non-violence get lost in hype against terrorism","AHMEDABAD: Only rarely does the Mahatma Gandhiâ€™s statue at Income-Tax Circle draws as much attention as it did on Wednesday morning.

VVIPs, police top brass and NGOs flocked to this venue to observe the Anti-Terrorism Day on a call given by Chief Minister Narendra Modi.

But amidst all the hype created by the BJP government, which has hijacked the anti-terrorism plank from the Congress on a day when Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated, virtually nobody mentioned the two cornerstones of the Mahatmaâ€™s philosophy â€” peace and non-violence.

A skating rally that had been organised by the state government on the occasion began after paying homage to Mahatma Gandhiâ€™s statue at Income-Tax Circle and concluded at Gandhijiâ€™s Sabarmati Ashram.

Modi delved on terrorism and how one should beware of their neighbours (Incidentally, Wednesday also marked World Neighboursâ€™ Day!). It all started around 7.30 am at the Income-Tax Circle on Ashram Road. The traffic junction was swarming with policemen. Right from the city police commissioner K R Kaushik to policemen from all the neighbouring police stations, everybody was on duty.

Wails of sirens soon resounded as a motley crowd of politicians gathered around the statue of Gandhiji.

Walking up the flight of metal stairs temporarily erected for him, Modi garlanded the statue with cotton hanks. Modi then flagged off a rally in which 100 children skated on rollers towards the Sabarmati Ashram along a route lined up with a human chain.

Modi and his ministers then decided to follow the children on a police mobile van throwing the early morning traffic out of gear.Addressing the children and the small crowd that had gathered at the ashram, Modi began warning the masses on terrorism and ended up, as usual, blaming the media for terrorist attacks.

â€œOne has to beware of the emerging situation and take note of the fact that ISI is trying to spread its tentacles into Gujarat. They are now targeting cities like Bangalore, Hyderabad, Mumbai, Surat, Ahmedabad and other parts of Gujarat.

They want to harm the economic strength of the country,â€� Modi asserted. While cautioning the public to beware of new neighbours in their localities, Modi then directed his ire towards media. Without explaining why his government stripped the former minister of all security cover, he referred to the murder Haren Pandya and the attack on Akshardham.

An oath to fight â€œmany faces semi-terrorismâ€� was administered to the motley crowd on the occasion. Little Pratik Nanda,who had skated down the Ashram Road, however had a different point of view. â€œPrem se jito. Terrorism can be defeated with love.â€�

1,Govt rules out roll back of CAS,"NEW DELHI: The government on Wednesday sought to clear the confusion on the CAS front by affirming that it was committed to meeting the July 14 deadline for the switchover to the set-top-box era of TV viewing. At a meeting of the broadcasters, big cable operators and consumers in the information and broadcasting ministry, the government representatives made it ``unequivocally'' clear that there would be no rollback of CAS nor any reduction of its proposed area of operation. ``The date stands unchanged,'' a ministry official told the meeting. In fact, the government has proposed to bring a notification within a fortnight to make the broadcasters announce in advance the number of channels that would go pay and how many to be part of the free-to-air bouquet. Another notification would compel the broadcasters to declare the price of a pay channel. The measure is intended to ensure that the price of a pay channel should not be much higher than the average price of a free-to-air channel. ``If a bouquet of 10 channels costs Rs 50, then a pay channel should be available for not more than Rs 7,'' an official later said explaining the pricing policy. The notifications have been necessitated by the fact that the major cable operators have not yet been given any information by the broadcasters regarding this. The major cable operators pointed out that without any knowledge of the price and number of pay channels, it would be difficult for them to make the necessary investment. ``Why should someone invest in boxes unless it is known exactly how many channels will go pay,'' said a participant in the meeting. There have been reports about political pressure being brought on the government not to go ahead with the CAS implementation because of a perceived reaction from people to the additional expenditure of Rs 3,000-Rs 5,000 on the box. With the next round of assembly elections due in four states later this year, the government has reportedly been told to go slow on CAS. The four metros of Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and Kolkata are scheduled to switch over to the CAS regime from July 15. The government, however, has turned down the proposal to introduce CAS in Chennai first. It was clarified that the box would be required only to access the pay channels.

2,Three arrested for Vashi girl's murder,"MUMBAI: Rs 50,000 in cash, gold ornaments and a mobile phone was what Karim Khan, an auto driver, allegedly promised Mohammad Faisal and Nawab Ali for killing his sister-in-law, Simi Kaur.

On May 10, they allegedly killed Kaur (18) near the Chheda Nagar creek at Chembur and dumped her body there. A week later, the law caught up with them. The trio is now in police custody on charges of murdering Kaur, a resident of Vashi Naka, who worked with a mobile phone dealer.

The murder came to light after Tilak Nagar police found a body floating in the creek on May 11. Inspector Prakash George said, â€œWe traced the victim''s family in Vashi Naka. The victim''s sister Pinky Kaur identified her sister''s body.''''

Investigations have revealed that the victim was planning to marry Feroze, the mobile dealer with whom she worked. Inspector George said Karim Khan decided to get her eliminated as he feared that he may have to vacate the house after Simi''s marriage.

Simi and her sister, Karim''s wife, stayed in the flat at Vashi Naka with Karim. The sisters jointly owned the flat.

3,Check dowry law misuse by women: HC,"NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court on Wednesday said that matrimonial offences where a woman is not physically assaulted should be compoundable and bailable.

Justice J D Kapoor upheld a trial courtâ€™s order and said two provisions of anti-dowry law under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) were being misused.

Justice Kapoor was hearing the petition of Savita Devi who had challenged the order of metropolitan magistrate Nisha Saxena. Devi claimed the magistrate had erred in not framing charges against her father-in-law and two sisters-in-law.

Saxena had only charged Deviâ€™s husband for dowry harassment.But Devi claimed before the court that the in-laws too had harassed her since they refused to accept the customary gifts.

Justice Kapoor, however, held that the only allegation of not accepting the customary gifts in a marriage does not amount to harassment or cruelty as contemplated under Section 498 A (harassment for dowry) of the IPC.

He further held the investigation into the offences pertaining to dowry should be held by civil authorities like executive magistrates. Cognizance, the judge said, should be taken only after the findings on the commission of offences.

And until such a mechanism is evolved, Justice Kapoor said only an assistant commissioner of police should investigate cases for dowry harassment and that a deputy commissioner of police should be the investigating officer in a case where a woman dies due to dowry harassment.

He also took a serious view of cases where some children are arrested under the charges of dowry harassment. Justice Kapoor ruled: â€˜â€˜There is a growing tendency among women, which is further perpetuated by their parents and relatives, to rope in each and every relative, including minors and even schoolgoing children of distant relatives.â€™â€™

Where a schoolgoing child is named, the judge said, he or she shall not be arrested.

4,Eight arrested for pilfering LPG,"PATIALA: Eight persons were arrested in raids at the food and supply departments in Sangrur, Patiala, Ludhiana and Fatehgarh Sahib districts, for pilfering subsidised LPG, according to Dr Bhupinder Pal Singh, deputy director, Food and Supply Department, Patiala. He said that cases had been registered and the department had seized around 200 gas cylinders, out of which 115 had been seized from Mandi Gobindgarh by department officer Charanjit Singh Grover, who had earlier exposed the racket of conversion of subsidised bluecoloured kerosene oil into white for sale in the open market at Mandi Gobindgarh. Bhupinder Singh said that two factories at Ludhiana, where the subsidised LPG was being used for commercial purposes, were raided and their owners arrested. At Sangrur, Parveen Kumar and Diwan Chand had also been apprehended for selling subsidised LPG at higher rates, and at Amloh, Balwant Singh has been arrested for allegedly pilfering LPG. The deputy director said that at Mandi Gobindgarh, a firm, PG Steel was selling subsidised LPG for commercial purposes by filling it in commercial cylinders. With the commercial cylinder priced at Rs 600 in the market, the pilferers sold these cylinders for Rs 300 each on the black market. The department also raided a Service Station at Kohria Dirba and found 9900 litres of diesel less, and also that it was being sold at higher rates. The deputy director held a meeting of district food and supply controllers of Fatehgarh Sahib, Ludhiana, Patiala and Sangrur districts at Fatehgarh Sahib on Tuesday, in which he told the concerned officers that Food and Supply minister Avtar Henry had issued special directions to stop pilferage of LPG and other essential commodities and if any officer did not bother follow these, strict action would be taken against him.

5,3 'journalists' arrested for extortion,"NEW DELHI: The northeast district police arrested three persons, including two women, who allegedly extorted money by posing as journalists.

The police said main accused Nimmi and his associates worked for a weekly newspaper, Asian Link Today. But the police claimed that it was just a front operation for their illegal activities. Deputy commissioner of police (northeast) Praveer Ranjan said: ''The gang used to forcibly enter a premise and blackmail the occupant into giving money. On May 20, they entered the house of one Mehru Nisa (28) of Gokulpuri and demanded Rs 25,000.'' The DCP said Nisa was in her house with three children when the accused forcibly entered the house.

6,Minister blasts Punjab govt for failing to utilise Central aid,"CHANDIGARH: Union minister of state for rural development Annasaheb M K Patil on Wednesday criticised the Punjab government for gross underutilisation of funds provided to it under various Centrally - sponsored schemes. Interacting with mediapersons after reviewing the progress of these schemes in a meeting with state government officials, he said the officials had failed to provide a satisfactory explanation for not utilising the funds running into a few hundred crores over the last two and a half years. To a query, he said as of now he was not in a position to say whether these funds had been diverted by the state government to some other projects, but asserted that he would get the matter investigated. Reeling out figures, he said while some states had not only utilised the funds provided to them under these schemes but asked for more, Punjab was among the states which had recorded the least utilisation of funds. He said under the 100 per cent Centrally-sponsored PMGSY', Punjab had been granted Rs 101 crore in 2000-2001 and even after two and a half years it had shown unutilised funds to the extent of Rs 53 crore.

8,HC asks govt to explain denial of land to school,"PATNA: The Patna High Court on Wednesday directed the state government to inform it by July 15 why it has not allotted 22 acres of land to the Bikram Navoday Vidyalay so far. This order was passed by a division bench, comprising of Justice Nagendra Rai and Justice A K Verma, while hearing a PIL filed by Smriti Singh and other students of Vidyalay. Appearing for the petitioner, advocate M P Gupta submitted before the bench that the Patna DM and the commissioner of Patna division had recommended the allotment of 22 acres of land to the Vidyalay. ""But the state government is not allotting land to the school deliberately on political considerations,"" he added. He further stated that the very existence of the school, which was set up three years ago in Bikram, is at stake due to non-transfer of land to it and if it is closed it will deprive the poor meritorious students of proper education. The school has already stopped admitting students to Class VI. Even rooms for practical classes, library and computer training are yet to be constructed, he added.

9,Of cellphones & politics,"PATNA: Bihar is passing through politics of ""mobile phones and their printouts"". In the dock is Union minister Dr C P Thakur. Laloo Yadav on Wednesday waved before journalists the printout of a call made by the abductors of Dr Ramesh Chandra to the residence of Dr Thakur as ultimate proof of Thakur's nexus with the kidnappers' gang. Thakur defends himself saying ""the phone is kept downstairs where a large number of people, including some from my constituency, reside"". He was not in Patna when the phone call was made. But the ""alibi"" appears to be unacceptable to Laloo. ""The owner should know who lives in his house and who uses the phone,"" remarked the RJD chief. Ironically, around five years ago, when Thakur was charged with snatching ballot papers at a booth in Kankarbagh, it were the telephone printouts which came to his help. The booth had been looted by his opponents and Thakur, through his mobile phone, repeatedly contacted the Patna DM giving information about booth-capturing. When charges were levelled against him about looting ballot papers at the booth, the phone printouts of his calls to Patna DM came handy as proof of his innocence. ""If the printouts of telephones at the CM's residence is taken, it would make startling revelations. It would reveal that 1, Anne Marg had received phone calls from many legislators like Surendra Yadav and Azad Gandhi, who are absconding,"" stated leader of the opposition, Sushil Kumar Modi. He insisted that printouts did not reveal the nature of talks. Incidentally, BSNL appears to be under pressure. Laloo threatened to take action against BSNL because, he alleged, one page of the printouts of phone calls was torn. ""We will not spare even the BSNL employees,"" he remarked. Crime and politics in Bihar have gone hi-tech with mobile phones. Beur central jail, where several legislators are lodged, has been repeatedly said to be the epicentre of crime.

10,Abduction brings caste politics to fore,"PATNA: The recovery of kidnapped neurosurgeon Ramesh Chandra has brought to the fore the prevailing caste politics in the state. A couple of hours after the doctor was recovered by the police, junior health minister in the Rabri government Akhilesh Prasad Singh targeted Union minister Dr C P Thakur. According to the talks I have had with senior police officers, the kidnappers telephoned Samata Party MLA Sunil Pandey and Union minister Dr C P Thakur shortly after Dr Chandra's abduction, he said and insisted that Dr Chandra's kidnapping was the result of a high-level conspiracy meant to destabilise the Rabri government and pave the way for the imposition of the President's rule in the state since the President was scheduled to visit the state. He demanded Dr Thakur's resignation from the Union ministry. Refuting the charges, Dr Thakur said: This is not for the first time that I have been framed in some case. When there was a massacre in Haibaspur, I was framed in the case. However, the investigations revealed that there was no truth about my invol-vement in the massa-cre. Even the Dalits made a statement in my favour. Dr Thakur recalled that in the recent past RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav had blamed him for being instrumental in getting the seat of chief minister Rabri Devi changed in a flight from Delhi to Patna. Laloo Prasad Yadav feels that by hurling charges against me his own vote bank will be strengthened, he remarked. Thakur ridiculed Akhilesh for the remarks made against him. Akhilesh had made an unsuccessful bid to woo Bhumihars by holding a rally. He has given vent to his frustrations against me, he said and added that he was being victimised because he had raised the issue of non-development in the state. The word development makes Laloo Prasad Yadav angry, he said. On his part, Akhilesh Prasad Singh refuted Thakur's charges. The rally organised by me was successful and a large number of my caste men had assembled in Gandhi Maidan. If the RJD had not organised the Brahmarshi Mahasabha, then Thakur would never had been able to make it to the Union ministry again, he said.

11,DGP for stringent law to curb crime,"PATNA: DGP D P Ojha said on Wednesday that the police headquarters had sent a proposal to the state government for enactment of a stringent law to book criminals. The law would be on the pattern of Maharashtra Organised Crime Control Act. Ojha said that the proposal was being vetted by the law department. If enacted, the law would be tougher than the existing Crime Control Act in Bihar. He said the situation was really turning from bad to worse and, hence, such a law must be enforced in the state. He said according to a rough estimate, 10,000 to 15,000 criminals were absconding in the state for the past two decades. These criminals were evading arrest for different crimes ranging from murder, dacoity and kidnapping and their arrest was essential to rid the state of crime. This could be possible only by proper investigation and a stringent law, Ojha added. He said the state government had handed over the case pertaining to kidnapping of an engineer, Rohit Jha, to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). Jha was kidnapped from his place of posting in Saharsa district a few months back and was still traceless.

12,Vajpayee sets sight on polls,"LUCKNOW: Laying the foundation for the next parliamentary election and aware of the eroding strength of the BJP, Prime Minister Vajpayee on Wednesday made an impassioned appeal to the people of Lucknow to assess him on the basis of the works done and while doing so not only vote for him but also keep 'dhyan' of his party. Vajpayee's observation came shortly after chief minister Mayawati told Lucknowites to keep an open heart on the issue of voting for the PM in the impending parliamentary polls pehle ke muqabale mein kai guna vote se unko chun kar bhejna hai (As compared to the earlier polls, we have to ensure his victory by a far bigger margin). While the CM's appeal was only for the PM, the PM also included his party in his appeal. The occasion for both the appeals was the unveiling and the laying of foundation stones of 22 projects out of which 6 were of the Railways. These included the Gomtinagar terminal station, two overhead bridges at Daliganj, extension of the MEMU train services till Kanpur, computerisation of the Daliganj reservation centre and the unveiling of the new premises of the Indian Rail Transport Management Institute. The other projects launched on the day at Kudiya Ghat were Balmiki Ambedkar Awas Yojana, phase II of the Ganga Action Plan and setting up of a Biotechnology Park. The estimated cost of all these projects stands in the vicinity of Rs 1000 crore. Vajpayee, who reminded the people of his constituency that he was standing before them in the capacity of their MP and not the PM, said he wanted Lucknow to be at par with Hyderabad and Bangalore. And added that though much progress by way of development had taken place, much more needed to be done. Expressing happiness over the efforts being made to clean Gomati, he said for all round progress cooperation was required from all sections of society. He praised the state government by stating that Lucknow was being counted amongst the happening cities because it was being governed by people who understood the 'waqt ka takaza' and believed in the kind of progress which would benefit all. But the MP in him soon gave way to the PM when he said that he could not differentiate between states on the basis of political differences. The source of this observation was BJP's rout in Himachal Pradesh and the growing feeling that the Centre would now reduce the funds for its development. He added when famine stalked the country his government did not allow the people to die of hunger. Vajpayee said the coalition government of Uttar Pradesh was also striving to bring about an improvement at all levels. He assured the chief minister of all Central assistance as and when required. Earlier, chief minister Mayawati stated that it was largely on account of the efforts of the PM and the urban development minister Lalji Tandon that Lucknow was fast emerging as an important city. While the city was earlier known as 'Nawabon ki nagri' it was now being discussed for its modernisation. She spoke about the Ambedkar Park also. Railway minister Nitish Kumar assured that the new terminal would be better than the Charbagh station while Lalji Tandon threw light on the developmental projects being presently undertaken.

13,Bandaru emerges favourite to head party post in AP,"HYDERABAD: Junior minister for railways Bandaru Dattatreya has emerged as the most favoured candidate to succeed Chilakam Ramachandra Reddy as president of the BJP's state unit. Ramachandra Reddy does not want to go on record but party leaders indicate that Dattatreya's succession is a foregone conclusion. According to a senior party leader, Dattatreya is being preferred as he hails from Telangana and maintains a rapport with chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu. This would help the party when it discusses seat-sharing with its ally, the TDP before the next election. During the local body elections two years ago, Dattatreya was able to prevail upon the TDP leadership to concede some highly contentious seats to the BJP. Secondly, Dattatreya's elevation will help the BJP recover from the setback it suffered due to the exit of two top leaders from Telangana, A Narendra and R Ravindranath Reddy. The formal decision naming Dattatreya as state unit president is likely to be announced in the first week of June. Talking to The Times of India on Wednesday, Dattatreya said he was prepared to take up any work assigned to him by the party leadership. Another name that has been discussed by the state leadership from Telangana was that of junior minister Ch Vidyasagar Rao, but the scales appear to be tilting in favour of Dattatreya. Meanwhile, BJP deputy leader in the Assembly, K Laxman said the Hyderabad unit would be meeting here on June 1 to complete the process of party elections. He said intense discussions were on over the new city BJP president.

15,Union minister's PA caught taking bribe,"NEW DELHI: The CBI on Thursday arrested the personal assistant of a minister for allegedly accepting a bribe of Rs 4 lakh from a deputy income tax commissioner. The agency also arrested the deputy commissioner. The accused, R Perumalswamy, is a personal assistant of minister of state for finance Gingee N Ramachandran and had demanded Rs 4 lakh from additional commissioner Anurag Vardhan for getting him transferred to Mumbai. The CBI have also detained a Chennai-based chartered accountant, Krishnamurthy, who acted as a conduit and introduced Vardhan to Perumalswamy. After the CBI raids, which continued till late on Thursday night, the government put on hold the transfer of 54 income tax officials. Acting on information that Vardhan, a 1994 Indian Revenue Service officer (IRS), had approached Krishnamurthy for his transfer to Mumbai, the investigating agency monitored the accused. The CBI spokesperson said Krishnamurthy fixed a deal of Rs 5 lakh for him and asked him deliver the money to a 'tout' on Thursday, a day after the transfer list was out. ''The CBI was unaware of who the tout was,'' the spokesperson said. Vardhan was asked to wait at his residence in Safdarjung Development Area where Perumalswamy was to collect Rs 4 lakh. Since Thursday morning the CBI kept a surveillance at Vardhan's residence. They saw Perumalswamy entering the house.

16,"Sajjad Lone talks peace, abhors violence in J&K","SRINAGAR: People's Conference chairman Sajjad Gani Lone on Thursday asked people to shun violence and join talks process in the changing situation at the international level. Addressing an impressive gathering on the occasion of first death anniversary of his father Abdul Gani Lone here, Sajjad said: Kashmir neither is anybody's nerve- centre nor is an integral party of any country but belongs to Kashmiris. Abdul Gani Lone was assassinated by some unidentified gunmen at a function held to observe the death anniversary of Molvi Mohammad Farooq at Iddgah on May 21,2002. Earlier to this, senior Lone had issued statements asking foreign militants leave Kashmir and allow the natives to plead their case of their own. Jammu and Kashmir People's Conference is considered an important part of All Parties Hurriyat Conference, which is composed of 25 separatist outfits. Without naming Pakistan, Sajjad Lone said that Kashmiri's lawyer was not able to plead the case of Kashmir in right manner while Kashmir failed to produce rightful leadership to fight the case. He said Abdul Gani Lone was not an individual but a thought for which he was assassinated by the enemies of peace. Sajjad reiterated that senior Lone's mission would be carried forward, even though the enemies of peace might be planning to eliminate them as well, he remarked. Without naming separatist leaders, junior Lone said that leaders of the day are aspiring to establish their wards while advising the wards of the poor for arms training for perpetuating violence. Warning the people for missing an opportunity of settlement of Kashmir issue, junior Lone said that Kashmiris must join the dialogue process for the permanent resolution of Kashmir problem. The People's Conference chief criticized leaders for issuing statements against the US and UK in the present circumstances.

17,NDA govt failed on all fronts: Sonia,"DABRA, Madhya Pradesh: Charging the NDA government at the Centre with 'failure' on all fronts, Congress President Sonia Gandhi on Thursday said it had done nothing to remove fear and corruption from society. Addressing a public meeting here, Gandhi said the Vajpayee-led government had promised to remove fear and corruption but had failed to do so. Instead, it had worked to create hatred among brothers which was ""not in the country's interest"", she alleged. The NDA government had not fully utilised the defence budget and as a result necessary equipment could not be purchased during the Kargil war, she alleged. All the Congress governments in the country were doing a much better job than non-Congress governments, she claimed and praised the Madhya Pradesh government for implementing the Davit agenda.

18,"Listen to us also, says Sikkim chief minister","GANGTOK: Like other NDA partners and allies, the tiny state of Sikkim is no exception to pre-poll political posturing. What Andhra Pradesh chief minister Chandrababu Naidu said recently was dittoed by his Sikkim counterpart, Pawan Chamling, last week - that relations are courteous, but that is all there is to the ties with the NDA. ""Kaam ho raha hai,"" was Chamling's short, non-committal reply to queries about his role within the NDA. Indeed, Chamling appears to have a bee in the bonnet about the southern state. ``Mine is a small state...only one MP. I am not heard as well as say Naidu who is not even an NDA member. I would like to improve the quality of cooperation with the Centre.'' These views are expressed just before the impending cabinet reshuffle. During the last round, Chamling had written to Prime Minister Vajpayee that the two Sikkim MPs, one each from Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha, be considered for ministership, the first-ever for the Himalayan state. But Chamling does not appear to nurse a grouse. It is only that he would like his long wish list taken seriously and acted upon. The list includes a Central university (colleges in Sikkim are affiliated to North Bengal University) and an airport at Pakyong for which he is ready to give land and other assistance. While he is not looking for ``five star hotels like those in Mumbai and Delhi'', he wants environment-friendly infrastructure for tourism, which is his state's mainstay. Making Sikkim the ``Switzerland of the East'' is Chamling's principal line to attract tourism and investment alike. On the flip side is the mushrooming of high-rise buildings that pose an ecological hazard in the hilly terrain. Gangtok is getting increasingly congested with little curbs on vehicle movement and tree felling. But overall, Sikkim is the only state that has been increasing its forest cover. Chamling admits that the roads in the 350-year-old capital city have too many potholes. But he insists that given necessary funds and infrastructure, he can work wonders. Sikkim's revenue has gone up from Rs 74 crore eight years ago to Rs 250 crore. The target is Rs 1,000 crore by 2015. Generating jobs for the youth is a big challenge, else they could swell the ranks of the disgruntled lot in neighbouring Darjeeling. Locals say that Darjeeling wants to merge with Sikkim. But that would not be good for Sikkim, nor would West Bengal permit it. On the farm front, the local tea is doing well, although it is marketed as Darjeeling tea. Chamling has another USP - 92 per cent of agriculture is done on organic fertiliser. Conscious that there is great export potential, he says the target is to achieve cent per cent organic manure. In his eighth year in office, Chamling claims to have given Sikkim more than just political stability. Although there is an undercurrent of turmoil among the various ethnic groups ^ the Gorkhas, the Bhotias, Lepchas and other tribals - Sikkim, he maintains, is an oasis of peace in the otherwise tumultuous north-east.

19,NHRC seeks report on protection to Gujarat riot victims,"NEW DELHI: More than a year after its critical report on Gujarat violence, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) on Thursday asked the state's director-general of police to give a report on protection of victims and witnesses deposing in various trial cases and the commission inquiring into last year's violence. Giving two weeks' time to the DGP, the NHRC said the ``right to a fair trial is a constitutional imperative'' and, therefore, the state government should inform it ``whether any measures have been taken to protect the safety, physical and psychological well-being, dignity and privacy of victims and witnesses who have to depose either in court or before the commission of inquiry and, if so, the nature of that protection to enable them to depose freely and fearlessly''. In what can be an indirect reference to the reported statement by Justice Nanavati of the commission of inquiry, that so far nothing has come out against the state officials, NHRC said: ``The fairness of a trial includes proper protection of the rights of the accused, as also the capacity of witnesses to come forth to make true and faithful statements in respect of matters within their knowledge without any fear or favour. Fair trial also envisages a fair deal to the victims of crime.'' A senior official was more vocal: ``The reported statement and the subsequent clarification by Justice Nanavati would force many prospective witnesses to not to appear before the inquiry commission. The NHRC is aware of its implications in finding out the truth.''

20,BJP now says it backs govt decision on CAS,"NEW DELHI: A day after BJP president M Venkaiah Naidu said the implications of the controversial Conditional Access System (CAS) for cable TV viewers needed to be studied, the BJP appears to have developed cold feet. Stressing that the BJP was not trying to stall the implementation of CAS in the four metros from July 14, Naidu said on Thursday: ``The BJP has not taken any stand on CAS. We are studying it and will talk to information and broadcasting minister Ravi Shankar Prasad about any problems in it.'' Party spokesperson Mukthar Abbas Naqvi went a step further. He said that in principle, the party endorsed the government's decision to implement CAS. ``The government has taken a step in the right direction. We are not in favour of stalling it.'' He denied that the party was ``studying'' the issue, but added: ``If there are any suggestions from party members, we will forward them to the government.'' His remarks are significant since reports from the party have suggested that CAS would not go down well with its constituents. Naidu had said on Wednesday that he would discuss the matter with Ravi Shankar Prasad when the latter returns from abroad.

21,Police constable commits suicide,"VADODARA: A police constable posted at the City police station here committed suicide on Wednesday night.

22,HC admits petition against college principal,"NEW DELHI: The Delhi High Court on Thursday admitted a writ petition filed by senior readers of Shaheed Bhagat Singh College challenging the appointment of Jitender Kaur as the principal of the college. Justice Vijender Jain admitted the petition which alleged that rules were flouted in appointing Kaur as the principal. The counsels for the petitioners, R K Saini and N R Sharma, said the former chairman of the governing body of the college, Harcharan Singh Josh, went out of his way to appoint Kaur. The high court had earlier sent notice to the Delhi University on Kaur's appointment. The teachers alleged that instead of forwarding a list of names for the post, the governing body had sent only one name which was accepted. The petition, filed by six teachers of the college, alleges that the appointment was illegal and arbitrary as all DU norms for appointing principals were given a go-by. The petitioners said that others, whose candidature were not considered, were more qualified than Kaur. The petitioner said the appointment is made by the governing body of the college on the recommendations of a selection committee headed by the chairman of the governing body, two representatives of the university and one expert nominated by the academic council. The petitioners alleged that this process was not followed in appointing Kaur.
