0,Only 10% of govt staff will be hit: Minister,"BANGALORE: Holding out hope to 5,014 government employees whose reappointment under the special rural weightage recruitment rules has been stayed by the Supreme Court, law minister D.B. Chandre Gowda said only 10 per cent of them will be affected.

Gowda told reporters on Tuesday: â€œIn lawyersâ€™ language, a stay means the process stops at the point it is. That is, the court has said â€˜thus far and no furtherâ€™. In this case, about 90 per cent of the rural weightage employees have already taken up their new jobs and will not be affected by the stay.

Only the remaining will face the problem.â€� Gowda said the government was committed to protect jobs of the remaining 10 per cent also. â€œWe will argue that it is only a one-time appointment, done on humanitarian grounds. The apex court has permitted such appointments in other cases. We will get the details of these to support our argument,â€™â€™ he added.

Refuting that Karnataka lost itâ€™s legal cases in the apex court due to bad presentation, Gowda said: â€œThat is a very wrong impression. We will appoint the best and most competent counsel to ensure that we win this case.â€� Gowda regretted that the reappointments in 80 different departments of the affected candidates had not been done at a faster pace.

â€œWe had two months time as the petitioners took some time to go to the court and get the stay. We could have completed all appointments within this time. I will get a report from officials on why there was delay,â€� he said. Legal experts including high court former Justice H.G. Balakrishna had suggested that the state push for a Constitutional amendment to accommodate the rural weightage clause.

â€œThis needs national level discussion and has to be done by the Parliament. We have already asked our MPs to take up the issue, we will ask them again,â€� he added. Gowda said opposition leaders will be consulted â€œif need beâ€™â€™ on the stateâ€™s strategy. â€œWe will discuss it with our leaders and see if there is need for an all-party meet on the issue,â€� he added.

1,Principals propose new school of thought,"

BANGALORE: It was a confluence of the brains behind the making of young brains. A chance for principals of the cityâ€™s prized schools to voice challenges of their mission.

In perhaps one of the first such initiatives in Bangalore, around 100 principals came together on Tuesday under the aegis of The Times of Indiaâ€™s Newspaper in Education (NIE) platform to brainstorm on the â€˜Challenges of Tomorrowâ€™ in education, at The Leela Palace. Five principals made presentations tailed by open house sessions.

The sessions were moderated by The Times of India Resident Editor H.S. Balram while The Times of India Deputy General Manager (RMD) Franklyn James welcomed the gathering and provided a roadmap for the meeting. The first speaker, Akash Ryall, principal of Bethany High School, addressed the challenges of the student community and identified obsolescence of teaching methods as the biggest hurdle.

â€œOutdated teaching methodologies, parental and peer pressure, information overload, burnout, over-specialisation and too much focus on making a living are the greatest issues before students... There is an overwhelming need to educate parents to help students tackle these challenges,â€� he said. Suggestions and queries followed thick and fast. Bangalore International School principal Anu Monga advocated regular counselling sessions and pointed out that appointing full-time counsellors had worked wonders in her school.

While Sneha Narayan, principal of VET School, J.P. Nagar, thought reorientation programmes for teachers would help, Kalpana, principal of SSM School, emphasised the need for value-based education. Hema Narayan, principal of Sudarshan Vidya Mandir, felt teachers need to be empowered. This would spawn innovation, ideation and creativity. The suggestion sparked off a debate on the need for attitudinal changes among principals. â€œUnless we are accessible, it is difficult to maintain a good relationship with teachers, students and staff,â€� felt Frank Anthony Public School principal C.A. Browne. On their part, principals too have to be proactive, according to John Zachariah, principal of Cathedral High School.

This called for leadership skills, apart from vision, considering the high expectations of stakeholders, he said. Sudha Ramamurthy, principal of AVM School, sought to know the role of the principal in introducing changes in syllabi. â€œAfter giving guidelines, allow teachers to discuss amongst themselves how best changes can be incorporated,â€� she said. Explaining innovations in curriculum introduced in her school, Vidya Shetty, principal of Presidency School, said adopting an integrated and thematic approach to curriculum had allowed children to learn through self-discovery.

â€œWithin the limitations of a syllabi, changes can be made in the way the subject is taught,â€� she said. Many principals wanted to know how these changes could be introduced, given the constraints of a fixed syllabi. Nothing should stop schools from adopting new methods, Shetty reiterated. Father Melvin Pinto, principal, St Josephâ€™s Indian High School, focused on the challenges of building institutions. â€œManagements should recruit committed teachers and dedicated staff... The government should remove restrictions on collecting donations and help schools raise public funding by involving parents and alumni,â€™â€™ he said.

A panel of principals â€” Browne of FAPS, Mohan Murthy of Baldwin Boysâ€™ High School, Sandhya Siddharth of A.V. Education Society and Sr Helen of Mariam Nilaya â€” along with The Times of India chief of metro bureau K.R. Sreenivas, assistant editor Ritu Rohatgi and senior city correspondent Anupama G.S. drafted the â€˜Bangalore Declaration â€” Agenda for Educationâ€™.

3,Govt employees protest against privatisation,"LUCKNOW: Nearly one lakh government employees on Tuesday went on a day''s token strike to lodge their protest against privatisation move of the government its indifference to a host of their demands.

The employees of various government departments reached their offices, appended their signatures and walked out without doing any thing.

Employees later went up to the dharna sthal and held a meeting where they warned the government to concede to their demands immediately or they would face a full-fledged strike.

The call for strike was given by the Uttar Pradesh State Employees'' Association.

UPSEA president Kuldeep Sharan Srivastava said that leaders of the employees association met the chief secretary a number of times to convince him about the need to concede to their demands but that proved futile. Eventually, the employees were compelled to go on strike, said Srivastava.

Some of the main demands of the employees are restoration of leave encashment, permanence to daily-work charge, immediate payment of four per cent dearness allowance, removal of order to effect a cut in the interest rate on allowances and restoration of LTC.

Employees also demanded an inquiry by a competent authority into bogus appointments and, above all, setting up the sixth pay commission for employees.

UPSEA general secretary Ram Lakhan Singh said that employees were forced to go on strike after their requests to concede to their demands did not evoke any action from officials. If their demands were not conceded to, they would be compelled to go on indefinite strike, he said.

Employees of government offices at the Jawahar Bhawan and the Indira Bhawan have decided to observe dharna on December 30 and 31 and, thereafter, boycott of work for two hours from January 1 to 4 and then half-a-day''s boycott till January 7. And from January 8, the employees will go on total strike.

4,Another arrest warrant against IAS official,"PATNA: A single bench of the Patna High Court, presided over by Justice Shiv Kirti Singh, on Tuesday issued a warrant of arrest against water resources development commissioner V Jaishankar, IAS.

Justice Singh directed the Senior SP, Patna, to produce Jaishankar in the court on January 6 to show cause in a contempt of court matter.

Water resources development commissioner Jaishankar had been summoned to appear in person before the judge on Tuesday and submit his reply to the show cause.

But he neither appeared before the court nor filed a reply to the show cause.

This contempt case is related to non-compliance of a high court order regarding payment of balance amount of retirement dues to Vaidehi Sharan Rai, who retired as a superintending engineer in the water resources department (WRD).

The matter would be heard again on January 6, 2004.

It may be recalled that only on November 20, another single bench presided over by Justice Radha Mohan Prasad had issued a warrant of arrest against Jaishankar in another contempt of court matter.

But neither did he surrender in the court on his own, nor was he arrested and produced before it. Thereafter, a non-bailable warrant of arrest was issued against him. But even then the police failed to produce him in the court and for this failure the Senior SP, Patna,Sunil Kumar had to face the wrath of the judge.

A police team was then sent to New Delhi to arrest him.

But, before the team could arrest him, he got a stay order from the Supreme Court.
