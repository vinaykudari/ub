0,"Youth shun corrupt politicians, polls","NEW DELHI: Delhi is all set to begin a new Assembly term with the counting of votes due to be completed on Thursday. For the city''s youth, however, politics is low on the priority list.

According to a recent pre-poll survey conducted by the Indian Institute of Mass Communication (IIMC), most young people are not interested in the political process because of the indifference of political parties towards youth-related issues. The level of corruption among politicians is another disillusioning factor.

The study conducted among students of Delhi University, Jamia Milia Islamia, Jawaharlal Nehru University and slum youth revealed that a large section of urban youth does not even know the date of polling.

""We sent our students to all parts of the city, from swanky shopping malls to slums. The aim was to find how aware and interested the young voter is about politics. The findings are significant as young adults appear extremely detached from mainstream politics,"" said Jaishri Jethwaney, one of the faculty members involved with the study.

Forty per cent of the respondents, out of a sample of 2,030, said they would not vote in this election. While 47 per cent said they were ""put off"" by politics due to corruption, 53 per cent were not keen on voting as issues affecting them had not been taken up by most parties.

""What difference does politics make to the life of an average student? No party speaks about employment or education. Politics in this country has always been seen as an old man''s business. There is no dynamism or freshness,"" said Avantika Sahai, a student of advertising.

While employment emerged as the most important issue on young minds, safety of women in the city came a close second with 40 per cent of the respondents saying it was number one on their list of priorities. Youngsters from slums, however, were better informed and 86 per cent of them got the polling date correct.

1,Crime Branch confirms Golawala's arrest,"AHMEDABAD: The city Crime Branch on Wednesday admitted to having arrested Salim Golawala, a historysheeter associated with the Wahab gang, and an accused in several criminal cases including fanning communal passions in Vadodara.

Golawalaâ€™s arrest was formalised within hours after joint commissioner of police (crime) P P Pandey told TNN on Tuesday evening that the Crime Branch had made no such arrest.

The history-sheeter, who hails from Vadodara, was allegedly picked up by Crime Branch sleuths from Ajmer, based on a tipoff on Tuesday evening. Golawala was with his wife in Ajmer when he was picked up.

He was reportedly brought to Ahmedabad for interrogation on Wednesday morning.

Though the mystery behind keeping Golawalaâ€™s arrest under wraps remains unexplained, the Crime Branch has alleged that the accused is responsible for sending youth from Vadodara and Ahmedabad to Pakistan for training in terrorism.

The Crime Branch also alleges that Golawala is part of a hawala racket that brought funds from Gulf countries for sponsoring terrorist attacks in states such as Gujarat.

The first criminal off e n c e against Golawala dates back to 1985.

Police records reveal that since then he has committed several crimes, including the murder of Mohammad Sajid in the Panigate area of Vadodara.

He has also has two cases against him for rioting and fanning communal passions at Ravpura and Vadi police stations of Vadodara.

2,Rs 500 crore at stake on satta this election,"NEW DELHI: If politics is not a gentleman''s game, then there is no guarantee that luck will be a lady in the high-stakes political satta game. But high-rolling Delhiites are willing to take a chance.

And if the bookies in Chandni Chowk, the den of the city''s satta bazaar, are to be believed, over Rs 500 crore have been put as stake money on the assembly election. ""While there was a Rs 350-crore stake riding on election day, there is already an additional Rs 150-crore at stake on the results,"" said a bookie.

Power minister Ajay Makan is the most favoured candidate to win among the bookies and commands a rate as low as 28 paise per Re 1 bet. He is followed by chief minister Sheila Dikshit drawing 33 paise, an indication that bookies are expecting a big win.

""Those who put money on Poonam Azad, Dikshit''s BJP rival in Gole Market, will draw a return of 57 paise per Re 1 bet. The returns are high because a bet on her involves a bigger risk as her chances of winning are slim,"" the bookie said.

Bookies appear confident of a Congress majority, so bets on who will form the government are evoking little interest. The favourite bet is on the winning margins of individual candidates.

""In Dikshit''s Gole market seat, about Rs 50 crore is at stake on her winning margin,"" said the bookie. Similarly in Moti Nagar, about Rs 25 crore is at stake on the vote margin as maximum polling had taken place there.

According to bookies, potential Congress winners like Mukesh Sharma, A K Walia, Mateen Ahmed, Naseeb Singh, Arvinder Singh Lovely, Chaudhary Prem Singh and Haroon Yusuf have rates between 30 and 40 paise as against their opponents in BJP drawing over 55 paise per Re 1 bet.

However, potential winners in the BJP camp like Jagdish Mukhi, Vijay Jolly, Harshvardhan, Surinder Ratawal, Naresh Gaur have rates below 40 paise per Re 1.

The BJP candidate from Model Town, Ashok Aggarwal has a close fight, but will win in the end, said a bookie in Chandni Chowk.

""His rate is 47 paise as against 53 paise put on his Congress rival Kanwar Karan Singh. The Walled City is abuzz with the satta fever as traders, jewellers and agents of the grain markets are busy deciding the swinging satta rates.

3,PU bandh against teacher killing,"PATNA: All academic activities in Patna University colleges and post-graduate departments remained completely paralysed on Wednesday as the teachers went on a dayâ€™s token strike in protest against the brutal murder of professor K C Singh of labour and social welfare department.

The call for the dayâ€™s token strike was given by Patna University Teachersâ€™ Association (Puta).

The entire university campus wore a deserted look on Wednesday as neither the teachers nor the students turned up to attend the classes. Puta vice-president M O Siddiqui claimed that the strike was a complete success. A delegation of the association would call upon the chancellor as soon as he becomes available in Patna and urge upon him to take necessary steps for improving the law and order condition.

An emergency meeting of the Puta general body has been convened at Patna College B A lecture theatre on Thursday to discuss the issue of ever increasing attack on university teachers and other pending demands of teachers, according to Puta general secretary Amar Nath Singh.

Condemning the killing of K C Singh, Federation of University Service Teachersâ€™ Associations of Bihar (Fustab) secretary A K P Yadav said teachers have become very soft targets for criminals as they cannot afford private security cover. It is but natural that as many as three teachers of PU have been killed within a few months and the criminals are still at large. He demanded that being the top most officer of the university, the chancellor must intervene and pressurise the government to protect the life and dignity of teachers.

The teachers of different colleges and universities in Bihar will stage a daylong dharna at R-Block crossing here on December 16 to protest the killing of university teachers and to press their other pending demands, said Yadav.

6,Sena-BJP stuns Cong in Council polls,"MUMBAI: The opposition Shiv Sena-BJP on Wednesday dealt a severe blow to the ruling Congress-Nationalist Party Congress coalition in Maharashtra by winning four of the five state legislative council seats for which elections were heldâ€”two in Mumbai, one in Nagpur and one in Akola.

The Democratic Front could only retain the lone Ahmednagar seat from where Yashwantrao Gadakh was elected for a second term. Large-scale cross-voting by Congress and NCP corporators in the BMC led to the defeat of their party nominee, Kamaruddin Merchant, in Mumbai. The Congress candidate for the Nagpur seat, Avinash Pandey, also lost because of cross-voting.

In Mumbai, BJP nominee Madhu Chavan secured 83 votes and was declared elected in the first round. As expected, the Senaâ€™s Arvind Sawant retained the partyâ€™s seat in the city, although his first round tally of 89 votes came as a surprise.

7,Assembly polls likely in first week of March,"HYDERABAD: Assembly elections are likely to be held in the first week of March. The dates will be announced immediately after the on-going revision of electoral rolls, which is scheduled to come to an end by January 20.

A state government team comprising chief secretary Mohan Kanda, chief electoral officer M Narayana Rao and secretary (political) Binoy Kumar, met the election commissioners in New Delhi for well over 45 minutes on Wednesday and discussed the tentative schedule for the elections.

The team briefed chief election commissioner J M Lyngdoh on the ""pace and quality of steps"" being taken by the state administration to ensure smooth conduct of the elections.

The election commissioners wanted to assess the state government''s preparedness for conducting free and fair polls, and they reportedly asked the state authorities to gear up.

Among the issues that cropped up during the meeting were rationalisation of polling stations and the revision of electoral rolls. The commission apparently asked the state authorities to ""monitor the progress from now on"".

The chief secretary will accompany chief election commissioner J M Lyngdoh back to Hyderabad on Thursday. Lyngdoh is coming to the city on a holiday and is unlikely to have an any official engagements.

This was Kanda''s second meeting with Lyngdoh over election dates. The government needs a gap of 21 days between the announcement of dates and the issue of the poll schedule. It needs a further 23 days for polling to begin. The TDP is inclined towards an early poll, for a mid-March election is likely to upset examination schedules.

Earlier, chief minister Chandrababu Naidu had made it clear that he was not interested in getting into a confrontation with the election commission and left it to the poll panel to fix an appropriate date for the elections. This was after an EC official went on record saying polls wouldn''t be possible before April.

8,HSBC may acquire UTI Bank when rules allow,"NEW DELHI: HSBC, which acquired 14.71 per cent equity in UTI Bank from the Mauritius-based CDC Financial Services and South Asean Regional Fund for Rs 306 crore on Tuesday, will make an open offer to the public at Rs 90 per share to buy an additional equity of at least 20 per cent, HSBC India CEO Niall SK Booker said here addressing a press conference.

Asked whether the bank was eyeing to acquire UTI Bank when the norms are eased, he said, â€˜â€˜We never rule out anything. If circumstances change and regulator agrees, we can look at the acquisition route.â€™â€™

HSBC will acquire an additional 5.37 per cent stake in UTI Bank from CDC later for Rs 112 crore.

However, at present, the foreign bank had no plans to exercise the management control.

But, Booker said, if the bank is offered a board seat in the UTI Bank, it would take that.

The acquisition of 20 per cent stake in UTI Bank by HSBC has been welcomed by the stock market as the share price of the company went upto Rs 114 on Wednesday, netting a gain of Rs 18 against the previous close at Rs 96.

Booker said the move was an indication of HSBCâ€™s commitment to India. He said the bank was exploring the other avenues also to invest here.

9,Contract farming at dead-end in Punjab,"CHANDIGARH: The lack of enabling legislative framework to enforce contracts and the failure of extension services throughout Punjab has resulted in a virtual dead-end for the contract farming programme with protests erupting in the worst-hit Malwa region of the state.

One consequence has been the active intervention of the government agency that designed the programme to save the day by procuring basmati rice, something the state government wanted to avoid in the first place by exiting from procurement and letting private players participate in a big way. ""Yes there are some problems but we are actively addressing the issue,"" K S Saroj, Punjab Agro Foodgrains Corporation (PAFC) MD, told Times News Network.

To begin with, the contracts entered into by companies wanting to buy basmati and the farmers selling the commodity did not have legislative backing of the kind available for wheat and paddy.

The sale and purchase of these commodities is carried out under the Punjab state agricultural produce marketing Act that governs markets, licenses and fee structure and provides a mechanism to sort out problems that are encountered in the trade.

The expression, ""contract farming"" along with the rights and obligations it entails have not been defined so far in any legislation dealing with the subject.

The result has been that PAFC has become a guarantor of the last resort both for farmers and buyers in case the transaction does not go off smoothly. In the non-traditional basmati growing region of the state,Malwa, it has had to regularly intercede to prevent the situation from turning ugly. This has led to bitterness among the farmers who sowed the crop according to price expectations formed last year and did not anticipate price volatility.

At the same time, the private companies that were to provide extension services, did not do their job properly. This was the case in all Malwa districts where farmers do not have much experience of growing basmati rice.

Issues like proper agronomic practices, regular visits to farmers andcommunicating the importance of quality norms were not addressed at all except, to some extent, in Ferozepur where one company did keep its operatives. At the same time, farmers did not pay the fee that was due to extension service providers and they soon lost interest with chaos ensuing in quality norms.

The result: In Bathinda, Sangrur and Mansa the basmati simply not up to the mark and virtually no buyers are to be found and PAFC will now have to enter the market to provide farmers the comfort price fixed earlier. In these districts, farmers have resorted to large-scale use of harvesting machines that result in high percentage of broken grains, and consequently lower the price. These farmers are not willing accept a lower price.

""We are taking up the issue norms for extension service providers and a framework will brought out within a week,"" officials say adding, ""this was the first year of contract farming and teething problems are not something uncommon.""

10,BJP rules out snap LS polls,"NEW DELHI: The BJP on Thursday ruled out snap polls to the Lok Sabha saying it needs more time for preparation.

â€œThere is a choice between a summer and September election, I am 100 per cent sure they will be on schedule,â€� party General Secretary Pramod Mahajan said in reply to a question on the possibility of an early Lok Sabha poll in view of BJP''s impressive performance in the assembly elections.

â€œElection Commission in India has become so independent that they do not allow you to decide date,â€� he said adding even if the Prime Minister dissolves the Lok Sabha half an hour from now, elections will still not take place before April-May.

Asked if the BJP was against an early general election, he said, ""We still need time (for preparing for polls) for UP, Bihar, we have NDA problems in Haryana and Tamil Nadu, in my assessment we need three to four months time for polls if we have to go beyond 180 seats.â€�

Mahajan who was the in-charge for his party''s campaign for the polls in the four states said the Election Commission has already stated it will revise the electoral list from January to include those who have attained the age of 18.
