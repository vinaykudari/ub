1,Stubbed out: anti-smoking law in dumps,"KOLKATA: The anti-smoking law seems to have gone up in smoke.

Itâ€™s nearly two years since the ban on smoking and spitting was brought into effect, yet a question on the number of prosecutions only draws an embarrassed silence from the cops.

The reason: the police have not made a single arrest since 2001. So you have people puffing away happily in hospitals, buses, auto rickshaws and roads.

Senior officers make a lame excuse. â€œOur meagre manpower is stretched painfully thin, but we have been working through the pressure of added commitments. The implementation of any new law has to be backed by an increase in police strength,â€� said an officer.

Besides, sudden enforcement of the law might create an adverse public reaction, the cops say.

â€œIf we suddenly start prosecuting offenders without making them understand what their offence is, we will look like extortionists,â€� said another officer.

But the same offence that goes unpunished in the city, meets with some degree of resistance elsewhere. In response to a question in the Assembly, the chief minister said that 51 people had been arrested and fined Rs 100 each for smoking or spitting in public.

Almost all of them were apparently prosecuted at Howrah railway station. People campaigning for a better Kolkata are upset by the failure of the anti-smoking law.

â€œThe bill had the potential of weeding out a habit that reflects poor health and hygiene sense, and affects the lives of large number of people. If the police stepped back, it would be unfortunate,â€� said Dr Arindam Bose, an antismoking campaigner.

â€œThe anti-smoking law will always be more in paper than action simply because it is a lifestyle oriented issue,â€� said social scientist Dr. Pradip Chakraborty.

â€œIf implemented properly, the law could have changed the face of the city,â€� Bose added.

But that seems to be a big â€˜ifâ€™. When asked about the law, a police sergeant almost dropped his cigarette as his jaw dropped.

â€œI am not aware of any such law. I would be prosecuted first if the law is enforced. I work on the road 18 hours a day. Where will I go for a smoke?â€�

2,PAPs held for suicide bid at Narmada dam,"RAJPIPLA: At least 15 persons were arrested from the Sardar Sarovar dam site on Friday afternoon for allegedly trying to commit suicide.

Official sources said they were project-affected people who had been demanding that one person from each family be given a job as promised by the government before acquiring their lands.

""These were mostly men from Nandod and Naswadi talukas who had sent an application on December 2, to the Sardar Sarovar Nigam and to us that they would commit suicide by drowning themselves in the Narmada river,"" said Narmada district collector D G Jhalavadia.

""Most of them were from the villages of Suka, Limdi, Godkoi and Kulu. As soon as they reached dyke number three shouting slogans, we arrested them under section 309 of the IPC.""

Sources added that the protesters had initially threatened to drown themselves anywhere between Kevadia Colony and Kutch giving the officials the jitters as such an exercise would stretch their resources thin. However once they gathered at the dyke, there was a posse of policemen and home guards with speedboats, to arrest them.

Although Narmada Bachao Andalon has said that they had nothing to do with the suicide attempt, they added that their demand was genuine. According to them, the government had acquired their lands for submergence after promising not only new settlement sites with better facilities, but also jobs for one member of each family.

They added that numerous applications and appeals had been made to the officials handling resettlement but to no avail.

Apparently, even lists have been provided with the names and educational qualifications of the family members. ""They are not even employed as daily wagers by the state government as they find contract labourers much cheaper,"" sources added.

3,CBI arrests visa racketeer in Ghogha,"AHMEDABAD: A CBI team from Mumbai, on Friday nabbed the kingpin of an immigration racket being run in Mumbai Ali Akbar Hussain Shaikh alias Bava from Ghogha, a small town in Bhavnagar district.

The accused has been running the racket for the past decade and was absconding since a case was lodged against him in Mumbai in 1992-93.

""Shaikh, a native of Ghogha used to supply fake visas and passports to those who wished to migrate to places like Dubai,"" sources said.

Since the accused eluded the CBI net for 10 years, a Mumbai court had declared Shaikh as a ''proclaimed offender''.

On two earlier occasions, CBI made abortive attempts to nab Shaikh.

However, its third attempt on Friday morning proved successful, when acting on a tip-off a joint team of CBI and local police raided Shaikh''s residence in Ghogha and arrested him.

4,'Govt fails to check farmers' exploitation',"LUCKNOW: The government came under fire in the Assembly on Friday for its failure to check exploitation of farmers at purchase centres set up for paddy procurement in different parts of the state.

The BSP, which staged a walkout over the issue, alleged that the purchase centres had been rendered non-functional due to non-availability of fund at their disposal to purchase paddy from farmers.

Raising the issue through an adjournment motion, Sukhdev Rajbhar of the BSP said that the result was that middlemen were exploiting farmers by compelling them to sell their produce at much lower than the Rs 550 per quintal fixed by the government.

Citing instances, he said his own district Azamgarh was a classic example of neglect where middlemen were thriving due to inaction on the part of the government.

Since the purchase centres were not able to make payment to farmers, middlemen were taking full advantage of the opportunity, he alleged.

However, rebutting his charges, food and civil supplies minister Ashok Bajpayee said: ""The government is committed to ensure welfare of farmers and there is no question of compromising on their interest.""

So far, he said, 106,700 metric tonnes of paddy had been procured and the government had paid Rs 78 crore against the total dues of Rs 92.76 crore.

This, he said, was a record purchase by the government which was fully geared to meet the exigency caused by bumper paddy crop this year.

6,Police arrests two with fake Rs 1000 notes,"lUCKNOW: Police on Friday arrested two persons and recovered counterfeit currency notes of Rs 1000 denominations. The currency notes were being pumped into circulation in a well chalked-out manner by a listed criminal having been trapped in the police dragnet several times on similar charges.

According to senior superintendent of police Rajiv Ranjan Verma, following a specific lead that a resident of eastern UP was pumping in fake currency into circulation in the state in general and the state capital in particular, police teams fanned out in the districts adjoining Lucknow to trace those who had earlier been arrested for their alleged involvement in fake currency racket.

""The exercise yielded results promising enough to lead to the breakthrough,"" the SSP said adding that police managed to obtain details about two of the gang members moving around in the Old City.

SP (West) SC Bajpayee, who supervised the operation, revealed that after the police rounded up the two suspects from near the flashlight tri-section in Bazarkhala, they were questioned about the details of their remaining gang members and the modus operandi to keep the racket thriving.

Identified as Rajesh Verma of Surya Nagar locality in Talkatora and Sonu Misra of Sonah Vihar in Kakori, the two during initial quizzing admitted to their involvement in the crime.

Circle Officer (CO) Bazarkhala Habibul Hasan said that as many as 29 counterfeit currency notes of Rs 1000 denomination were found at the instance of the arrested accused.

Interestingly, 24 of the of the notes had the same serial number (OA DJ 56 652). Other currency notes, more than one in count but of the same serial number, were also recovered at their instance.

The two were subsequently grilled by the Lucknow Police, central and state Intelligence agencies and Special Task Force to verify if the two were a part of a countrywide gang involved in shattering the economy of the nation.

The two accused, who sold dry fruits and nuts to betel shopowners to earn a living, were contacted by one Pervez of Faizabad. He usually met Rajesh and Sonu either at the district court or Sudarshan Theatre in Charbagh area.

Sources said that the meeting point at district court was chosen to help Pervez avoid movement in the city and minimise risk of being nabbed by the police. The two also revealed that they were given Rs 30,000 in fake currency in exchange of Rs 5000 worth of genuine rupee notes.

At times Pervez even met the two near Sudarshan theatre in Charbagh to deliver the fake currency notes. Pervez was earlier arrested in connection with the fake currency seized by Hazratganj police and one in Delhi on similar charges. Currently he was on bail and back to his games.

Police teams have fanned out all over the state in search of Pervez.

People should remember that they are humans first and religion should come later. The rally was also addressed by B. Sadananda Poonja, honorary president of Sahamata. Later, M.B. Sadashiva, president of Sahamata, presented a set of resolutions urging the government to curb anti-communal forces.

This was announced here by RJD legislative party leader and local MLA, Giri Nath Singh. Singh was addressing a one-day training camp of the party workers here recently.

Speaking on the occasion, Singh said that state government had assured the people of remove terror, corruption and unemployment from the state.

10,HC lawyers plan protest rally,"PATNA: In pursuance of the call given by the Bar Council of India, the advocates of the Patna High Court will take out a protest rally here on December 9 demanding withdrawal of the Legal Services Authorities (Amendments) Act, 2002, implementation of Section 30 of the Advocate Act and deletion of its Section 34(1).

A decision to this effect was taken at the meeting of the coordination committee of all the three associations of the HC advocates held here on Tuesday.

The rally is also against the entry of foreign lawyers, for constitution of the National Judicial Commission and rejection of the recommendations of Justice Malimath Committee.

The advocates said that the recommendations will do away with the law established and consistently followed.

In the Legal Services Authorities (Amendment) Act, passed by the Parliament in 2002, Section 22A has been added creating permanent Lok Adalats to dispose of matters in public utility services.

They further said that if one party brings a matter to a permanent Lok Adalat the other party has no choice, but to participate in the same and the authorities can decide the matter by way of a compromise or conciliation and if it is not solved they can decide the matter on merits.

The decision is final and no appeal can be filed against the same. Such Lok Adalats have been given powers to decide criminals matters too, provided they are not compoundable.

Section 30 of the Advocates Act, which gives lawyers the right of representation in any court, tribunal or authority having power to administer oath, is gathering dust on the statute book for the last 42 years.

Section 34(1) of this Act gives power to the HC to frame rules laying down conditions subject to which an advocate can be permitted to practice.
