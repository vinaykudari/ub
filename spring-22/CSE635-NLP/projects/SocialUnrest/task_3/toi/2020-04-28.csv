0,Govt notifies draft rules on CET: colleges ready for talks,"BANGALORE: Even as the Karnataka government notified draft rules for admissions to engineering, medical, dental and Indian systems of medicine and homeopathy courses, private college managements on Monday said they were open for talks with the government.

According to the draft rules published on April 26, the eligibility requirement for admission engineering courses is 35%, architecture 50%, medical, dental and Indian systems of medicine and homeopathy courses for general merit category 50% and SC/ST/Cat-I and other backward classes 40%.

Government quota seats will be filled through CET and managements for their quota can either use CET ranking or conduct entrance test as per government guidelines.

Managements who had decided to challenge the governmentâ€™s formula on admissions in the court said their demand now was for a uniform fee structure for engineering courses.

After a two-hour-long talks, KUPECA, part of the Consortium of Medical, Engineering and Dental (COMED) colleges, said the managements would file objections to the draft rules. Objections can be filed within 15 days of the publication of the rules.

â€œSince the government has not issued a final notification, weâ€™ll file objections,â€™â€™ KUPECA secretary D. Hemachandra Sagar said. Karnataka Unaided Private Engineering Collegesâ€™ Association (KUPECA) and Karnataka Private Medical Colleges Association president Shamanur Shivashankarappa told The Times of India, â€œWeâ€™ll study the rules and take a decision in four days.â€™â€™

Seat-sharing formula: COMED has decided to earmark 70% of seats to Karnataka students of which 25% of seats will be given to poor and backward classes students through 80% scholarship.

Scholarships would be provided by raising funds through sponsorships and philanthropic donations. As many as 15% of seats has been earmarked for open merit seats with preference to Karnataka students and remaining seats to non-Karnataka students. The 15 per cent management merit seats will be filled from among its applicants.

â€œOur demand before the government is to allow a uniform fee structure in colleges but provide for variation in fee between colleges depending on local needs,â€™â€™ he said.

The meeting was attended by representatives of 40 engineering colleges and 12 new engineering colleges which pledged support to the government.

Engineering colleges have been given time till May 10 to discuss with their managements and sign the written letter pledging their support to COMED.

If there is no progress in talks, the calendar of events for admission for these colleges would be issued on May 16, PESIT Director D.Jawahar said.

1,Mega shows await RJD rallyists,"PATNA: Residences of ministers and RJD MLAs are being decked up for the mega entertainment night in Patna, beginning from Tuesday evening.

Their spacious bungalows have scores of labourers working over night for making huge Pandals and stages. Those coming to participate in the April 30 rally are in for a big bash a day before they brave the sun at Gandhi Maidan. Food items to be served to the participants is another added attraction.

â€œBaleshwar Yadav and his troupe from Uttar Pradesh (UP) will entertain over 50,000 participants coming from Gopalganj,â€� said Dev Jyoti, the state vice-president of Yuva RJD and close associate of Sadhu Yadav, who is the brother of the chief minister.

According to supporters of Sadhu Yadav, the troupe contains at least 30 dancing girls. The programme starting from Tuesday evening is likely to last till 4 am next morning, they said. The other brother of the chief minister, Subhash Yadav, is also planning an â€œentertaining evening for his guestsâ€� reaching Patna by Tuesday.

He is relying on local orchestra group led by On Masumi, and also a â€˜bhajanâ€™ singer from UP Ajit Kumar Akela. His supporters also claimed that services of nautch girls will be taken to keep spectators glued to their seats in the massive Pandal constructed in his sprawling bungalow.

Junior health minister Akhilesh Kumar Singhâ€™s official residence will be another major attraction for participants. Singh has put his trust in a Mumbai based musical group called â€˜The surpriseâ€™, which will include popular â€˜qawwalâ€™ Anwar Khan, besides many other artists.

Minister for commercial taxes Abdul Bari Siddiqui is reported to be taking services of noted â€˜ghazalâ€™ singer Altaf Raza. â€œSiddiqui Saheb has to contend with his rival in Darbhanga and former MP Fatmi, who is working hard to bring in people from the area,â€� said his supporter.

The CPI-turned RJD minister Ram Lakhan Ram Raman has also made elaborate arrangements to entertain his guests. However, his supporters refused to disclose the names of artists, as only â€˜Mantrijiâ€™ knew about it.

Quite a few ministers, like energy minister Shakeel Ahmad and tourism minister Ashok Singh, have put up Pandals outside their residential premises just next to the road. Singh, who also happens to be the art and culture minister of the state, will use his departmentâ€™s artists to entertain his â€œguestsâ€�.

Meanwhile, RJD supremo Laloo Prasad Yadav is reported to have vented his anger at reports of nautch girls being used for entertaining the participants of the rally.

Speaking at a meeting of the committee to review preparations for the Maharailla, Laloo stressed that the entertainment arrangements made by ministers and MLAs for the participants should be healthy, like folk songs and Chaita.

â€œHe expressed his strong reservation against vulgar performance staged by nautch girls and threatened to take action against ministers and MLAs instrumental in staging them,â€� said the partyâ€™s state spokesperson Bhim Singh, stressing that senior leaders of the party have been instructed to ensure that such performances are not held.

2,Rlys to run 2 trains for rally,"DANAPUR: Railways will run two special trains to carry RJD workers to the state capital to attend the â€œMaharaillaâ€� on April 30. These two trains having the load combination of 15 coaches each, will originate from Darbhanga and Nawada respectively for Patna on Tuesday.

RJD is said to have deposited a sum of Rs 1.5 lakh with the railways towards fare charge for booking the two special trains.

According to sources, this is for the first time that RJD has paid in advance to the railways for running extra trains from far-off places to bring party workers for a rally to be held in Patna.

Keeping in view the expected rush of party workers from different places to the state capital, the railways have deployed additional armed forces at the Patna Junction in particular to safeguard railway property. Special RPF teams will be deployed in all long-distance trains to check unauthorised entry into the bogies on April 29 and 30, sources said.

According to railway officials at Danapur, many panicky people have already sought refund of their tickets booked for April 30. Thus, the railways will also suffer losses due to the â€œMaharaillaâ€�, an official said, adding that railways will not be able at any cost to check free-trippers, specially those coming from the Patna-Gaya, Rajgir-Bakhtiarpur, Mokama-Patna and Buxar-Patna sections of the Danapur division.

Meanwhile, rallyists have started trooping into the city. Patna junction has turned into a crowded station due to arrival of a large number of rallyists holding lathis in their hands. Eatables, tea and drinking water are much in demand. There was hardly any space left at the waiting hall of Patna junction on Monday.

According to sources, smooth movement of local passenger trains has been affected these days in the division due to frequent alarm chain-pulling and hosepipe disconnections resorted to by the rally supporters to board the trains at their convenience on different sections of the division.

3,State govt’s apathy decried,"PATNA: All India Confederation of Schedule Caste (SC) and Schedule Tribe (ST) Organisation chief Udit Raj has expressed serious concern over the apathy of Bihar government towards the development of the downtrodden in the state.

Talking to mediapersons here on Sunday, Raj said that the RJD government apart from some verbal assurance has so far done nothing for the benefit of backward community. The condition of the community has become worse during its rule, he said. Raj said that the policy of privatisation of education in the state will have an adverse impact on the society.

A huge population living below the poverty line in the state has little access to education.

He said that if Laloo is really concerned about the development of the poor he should have tried to clear the backlog in the government services. He called upon the people belonging to backward classes to put up a joint front to fight the inactive Rabri Devi government for their rights.

By organising the â€œlathi ghumawan tel pilawanâ€� maharailla Laloo is trying to divert the attention of the general people from the important issues like poverty and unemployment, he said.

Raj also talked about the Ayodhya dispute and the claim of Buddhists over the site. He tried to justify the claim of Buddhists by quoting historical reference of Fa-hein a Chinese traveller, who visited India in 5th century AD and wrote a book â€œTravels in India and Ceylonâ€�.

4,Hospitals gear up for rally,"PATNA: The state health department has geared up to meet medical emergencies on April 30, the day the ruling RJDâ€™s â€œlathi maharaillaâ€� is scheduled to be held at the Gandhi Maidan in Patna. All hospitals have been put on alert.

While the Patna district administration has decided to open 18 health camps in different parts of the city and deploy six static ambulances at the meeting venue, Patna Medical College Hospital (PMCH) has reserved 86 seats, including 50 seats at its Indira Gandhi casualty ward and neurology ward, for the needy among the rallyists. The hospital administration has also reserved 18 seats each in the surgery and orthopaedic wards.

Indira Gandhi Institute of Cardiology (IGIC) director Dr S N Mishra will remain present behind the dais at the Gandhi Maidan with a team of cardiologists. The deputy superintendent of the Gardanibagh hospital will be deployed at the chief ministerâ€™s official residence. The Nalanda Medical College Hospital (NMCH) administration has also reserved 50 seats in its emergency ward for the rallyists. NMCH superintendent Dr N K Singh said the number of physicians and surgeons on duty in the hospital will be doubled on the day.

PMCH superintendent Dr A P Singh also held a meeting with the heads of the clinical departments on Monday and directed them to remain present at the hospital throughout the day on April 30 and make themselves available during night on emergency call. Dr Singh said the district administration has asked the hospital to be ready with blood bags and allied emergency facilities.

Although IGIMS has not officially reserved any seat for the purpose, a senior doctor at the hospital said that about 20 seats would be kept ready for emergency needs. The reserved seats would not be allotted to other emergency patients, sources at PMCH and NMCH hinted. Patna civil surgeon Dr S K Aman said two to three doctors will man each of the 18 camps to be opened in the city. All the camps will have medicines, first-aid equipment, para-medical staff, stretchers and an ambulance each.

A Red Cross banner will be displayed near every camp to make it easy for the needy to locate it.

Preferring anonymity, a senior medical officer said, â€œeveryone knows chaos will prevail in the city on the day and none will risk to venture out until there is an emergency. â€œThe number of common patients will be less on the day also because of the largescale seizure of buses and other vehicles by RJD men,â€� he added.

The district administration has decided to establish medical camps at 18 places. They will function at Chiraiyatand, Rajendranagar, Chitkohra, Rajwanshinagar, Dumra outpost, near Ganga bridge, Dhukani Mor, Digha Road, Boring Road, Dak Bungalow Road, near the Patna Junction roundabout, Income-Tax roundabout, Beur Mor, Gaighat and Guru Gobind Singh Hospital, Patna City.

5,Credit policy: Boon for borrowers,"NEW DELHI: Borrowers can now laugh their way to the bank, thanks to the RBIâ€™s credit policy which is pushing key interest rates below inflation. And since the government is the biggest borrower in India, it will also be the biggest beneficiary.

For households and the private sector, which save, the gloomy news brought in by the Budget continues. The RBI policy does not provide any respite. The government is not bothered, since its always living beyond its means.

The credit policy proves wrong those who thought interest rates had bottomed out. Money was never so cheap. After the policy, it is likely to be even cheaper.

The inflation rate is now at a two-year high of around 6.5 per cent. The rate, at which commercial banks provide credit to their prime borrowers is as low as 10.5-11 per cent. Itâ€™s amazing that the banks, saddled with tens of thousand crores of bad debt and other inefficient overheads, manage to lend money at that rate that too after keeping a good spread for themselves. The banksâ€™ profitability has been aided by RBIâ€™s cheap money policy, sustained by your savings.

In the housing finance sector, where bank credit is showing the highest growth, funds can be borrowed at a variable interest rate of only 8 per cent. Competition among lenders and the wide choice available to borrowers in this case have been driving down rates.

The RBIâ€™s latest policy makes potential borrowers believe that interest rates could still move downwards. The strong signal comes from the cut in the benchmark bank rate â€”the rate at which banks borrow from the RBI â€” from a historical low of 6.25 per cent to a new low of 6 per cent. Even though it remains unchanged, the repo rate (the rate at which banks get refinanced short-term funds) is a meagre 5 per cent.

Both rates are lower than the inflation rate. So, the borrower (in this case the banks), instead of paying interest on the borrowed funds, in fact gets paid.

Moreover, the RBI believes in pushing down lending rates and making more money available cheap even as it estimates that inflation during 2003-04 would be as high as 5-5.5 per cent. Thatâ€™s the average for the year against last yearâ€™s 4 per cent. This means that banks will profit more out of their cheap access to funds.

The RBI also seeks to bolster the banksâ€™ lendable resources by releasing some Rs 3,000 crore into the system. That freeing of funds has been so timed as to meet the needs of the Centreâ€™s huge borrowing programme this year. Finance secretary S Narayan gleefully admitted that the Centre has been reaping a bonanza recently because of the RBIâ€™s soft interest rate policy stance and it again stands to benefit from this yearâ€™s credit policy.

Savers, particularly households and small savers, have nothing to look forward to. They have seen the rate on their savings bank account cut from 4 per cent to 3.5 per cent last year. In this yearâ€™s Budget and soon after, the small savers got the rude shock of successive cuts in interest rates on various savings instruments.

6,Mulund blast accused arrested for Ghatkopar explosion,"MUMBAI: In a fresh development in the probe in the recent bomb explosions in the metropolis, police today arrested incarcerated accused in Mulund bomb blast case Saquib Nachan for his alleged complicity in Ghatkopar explosion case.

Nachan was produced before Designated Judge A P Bhangale who remanded him to police custody till May 12. He was earlier held in Mulund bomb blast case and was placed in police custody till today.

With Nachan''s arrest in Ghatkopar bomb blast case, the links between the two explosions have been confirmed and the police suspicion that the blasts were masterminded by the same conspirators gained further ground.

Nachan, suspected activist of Students Islamic Movement of India, was arrested on April 10 and booked under Prevention of Terrorist Act. Nachan is the first accused to be arrested in Mulund bomb blast case. Later, three more were arrested. They are alleged to have engineered a blast in a local train at Mulund Railway station in which 11 persons were killed.

7,Talks incomplete without Hurriyat: Vohra,"SRINAGAR: Centre''s interlocutor on Kashmir, N N Vohra, on Tuesday admitted that his mission would be incomplete until he heard the extremist leaders.

""The process of talks will not be complete unless we have heard and discussed with all those who are angry, unhappy, dissidents and sharing a different belief,"" Vohra told reporters after wrapping up his nine-day visit to the Valley.

Appealing to ""everyone"" with whatever belief or ideology to come forward and hold talks, the 66-year-old bureaucrat expressed confidence that those who had not met him ""will come forward"" when he visits the Valley again.

During his mission in Kashmir, Vohra met several leaders of various political parties, including the National Conference, PDP and Congress and discussed the Kashmir issue with them.

However, the Hurriyat Conference and prominent separatist leader Shabir Shah declined to meet Vohra despite the statement by Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee that the Centre''s interlocutor would like to meet everyone.

Commenting on Monday night''s telephonic talks between Pakistani Prime Minister Zaffarullah Khan Jamali and Vajpayee, Vohra said, ""I am hopeful, it will have a positive impact on Indo-Pak relations.""

On extending formal invitations to separatist groups, he said that the Prime Minister, during his two-day visit to the Valley, had extended open invitation for all.

10,'Save SSIs' campaign to press for govt action,"HUBLI: Worried about recession, small-scale entrepreneurs affiliated to Karnataka Small Scale Industrialistsâ€™ Association (KASSIA) and North Karnataka Small Scale Industriesâ€™ Association NKSSIA) have decided to launch a â€˜Save SSIâ€™ campaign to press the state government to settle its long-standing demands.

A joint meeting of KASSIA and NKSSIA office-bearers on Tuesday tabled a set of five demands, urging the government to solve them on priority to save the â€˜dying industriesâ€™.

The demands include: payment of subsidies, measures to improve infrastructure, sale of 51 per cent of shares in KSSIDC and KSIMC in exchange for guarantee of efficient management.

The SSI associations have also demanded an early cabinet approval for the Small Industries Enterprise Bill 2002 and one time settlement of cases before KSFC. â€œThese measures could help more than two lakh units. It could especially help in the revival of 40 per cent of industries facing a threat of closure,â€� KASSIA president N.

Jayakumar told presspersons after the officer-bearers meeting.

The KASSIA and NKSSIA have formed a committee of 10 district presidents to oversee the implementation of the demands. They also have set up a platform to fight for their demands, including release of subsidies worth Rs 400 crore, on priority, to units in moffusil areas.

The KASSIA president said credit flow to SSI sector was dropping down and the number of new units starting is not satisfactory. Hence, specific measures to strengthen the existing units, proper implementation of CGTSI scheme of Union government should be made by setting up a cell in the state, Jayakumar said.

11,Pranab opposes disinvestment of PSUs,"New Delhi: The government needs to take ``hard decisions'''' on economic policy, but disinvesting in government-run companies is not necessarily one of these, senior Congress member Pranab Mukherjee told the Rajya Sabha on Tuesday during a discussion on the five-year Plan.

He wanted a closure of the budgetary gap by raising taxes and savings and judiciously cutting subsidies and spending. Though he did not specify where the cuts should effected, he urged the government to study the issue. In the absence of such decisions, the target of an annual growth rate of eight per cent did not seem realistic, he said.

Rajah Singh (BJP) said the Planning Commission needed to be commended for the way it had gone about the job. He also appreciated the National Highways Development Project, saying a programme like this was a basic condition for quick and all-round development.

Speaking for the government, minister of state for planning Satyabrata Mookerjee said the eight per cent annual growth target was realistic, though success also depended on a policy consensus in many areas. As for the criticism of disinvestment of government equity, the minister said it should be thought of no more than a switching of assets within the nation.

12,Rift in ICHR continues as members play politics,"NEW DELHI: Amid recent Holi revelry, HRD minister Murli Manohar Joshi released Rs 1.25 crores in history research money that had been delayed by six months. Although an equal amount is due to arrive, this has not helped cement the rift among ""Joshi''s hand picked men"", as members of Indian Council of Historical Research (ICHR) call each other.

Release of grants, blocked allegedly by an influential member, have got delayed projects going. But the internal differences have sharpened. Twelve of its 18 members have protested at being called names. They insist that there was nothing ""stormy"" about their meetings. Instead, in a joint statement, they appeal to the media''s ""good sense"" against spreading of ""damaging rumours"" that ""falsely target the chairman, the member secretary, members of ICHR and in turn, the Honourable Minister, Dr Joshiji.""

There is a good deal of shadow boxing. ICHR has a web site. But there is nothing official about it. A hardline member dishes out ""damaging rumours"" against the council itself.

As has been the procedure, all 18 historians are nominated on the general council by the HRD ministry. But some claim proximity to the minister or to some other leading lights of the Sangh Parivar. This has sharpened the jockeying for control of various projects of the council and the grants and scholarships. Reports from within the council speak of a continuing tussle among the ""hardliners"" and the ""moderates"".

Part of the problem, insiders say, is resistance to a chairman from outside the national capital by ""Dilliwallas"" -- the government bureaucrats and the academics from Delhi University, Jawaharlal Nehru Univesity, Jamia Millia and a little distance from there, Aligarh Muslim University. Till 1990, they hogged nearly 80 per cent of funds for research, says the current chairman, MGS Narayanan.

He is from Kerala. He has been accused doing up ""a bungalow"" with computers,airconditioners et al, at government expenses. His recent decision to hold the council''s meeting in Bangalore, and not the headquarters here, has also been criticised in pamphletes and media reports.

The allegations form part of a booklet credited to one of the members, Prof Makkhan Lal. Narayanan refutes the allegations. ""I live in a two bedroom house, and I have rented for my office a small flat, which I have not renovated or decorated.""

The Rs 4000 per month rent was fixed after being assessed by the local CPWD office. ""There is nothing five star about my travel or stay, here or in Kerala or anywhere else,"" he told the Times News Network.

Narayanan alleges that one reason that has angered his critics is his making the functioning of the council transparent. A newsletter publishes the list of grants and scholarships approved and lists work done. ""My dream is to have our own premises for the ICHR, set up a library where material is computerised and digitalised and there is networking with other institutions.""

But all this, he says, can take place smoothly, ""only if academics stop going to politicians for favours.""
