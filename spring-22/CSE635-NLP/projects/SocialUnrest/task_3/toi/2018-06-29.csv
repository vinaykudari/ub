0,Manipur students body warns political parties,"imphal: manipur students federation (msf) on thursday threatened not to allow four political parties to continue their activities in the state if they failed to state by june 30 whether they will be able to revoke the extension of ceasefire between centre and nscn (im) to the state. msf president pheiroija nando luwang in a statement asked the bjp, samata party, manipur state congress party, all nda partners, and the opposition congress, to reply by june 30 whether they would be able to revoke the ceasefire extension to manipur. accusing the mlas, who are now in new delhi, of ""inactivity"", the msf alleged they had failed to reach a joint decision in the interests of general people in manipur even at this crucial juncture. luwang said the formation of a committee for restoration of normalcy in imphal west and east districts by the government under the leadership of governor ved marwah meant the government had misinterpreted the nature of agitation on ceasefire issue. the msf asked non-government officials in the committee to resign as it was against the interests of the people. luwang said the anti-ceasefire extension agitation was being held in the entire state and not only in imphal east and west districts as it was reported.

1,NCP protests MTNL charging telephone rent,"mumbai: ""why do we have to pay rent for a telephone that we own?"" a crowd of protesters outside churchgate station on wednesday sought the answer to this question. the protest was organised by christopher keeler, president of the nationalist congress party's (ncp) telecommunications cell. ``we will continue to fight until this injustice is removed,'' mr keeler said. telephone users in mumbai have to pay rs 250 per month as rental charges. these rates are decided by the telecom regulatory authority of india (trai). this is in addition to the cost of the instrument, installation fees and the money paid for the calls made. ncp activists were of the opinion that there was no need for mtnl to charge rental fees, considering the fact that it has a full subscriber base. mtnl's deputy general manager of marketing, kishore kumar, responded to the protest saying, ``the rental charge is to cover installation, maintenance and service expenses incurred.'' he also defended the amount charged, stating, ``we give 150 free calls to compensate users, in addition to other services.'' other than land phones, mobile phone users also have to pay an ``exorbitant'' rental surcharge. in the case of the latter, the monthly rent charge is rs 395, as determined by trai. ncp activists are protesting against these rental charges as well. mr keeler said he had written letters to mobile phone companies, bpl and orange, as well as mtnl, about the matter. ``i am still awaiting responses from all these companies,'' he said. bpl and orange officials hold that their charges are justified, as companies all over the world charge rental fees in the same fashion. moreover, though trai has recommended a rental charge of rs 475, mobile companies in the city are charging much less, officials pointed out.

4,Mamata flays Bengal govt over Salt Lake issue,"kolkata: trinamul congress supremo mamata banerjee on thursday demanded resignation of the west bengal government following the arrest of criminal elements and recovery of arms on wednesday night from kolkata's yuba bharati krirangan, under the state sports and youth affairs department. she further said that though law and order was a state subject, there was enough ground for the centre to intervene. ""we do not think that the state government has any moral right to remain in power after wednesday's incident,"" said mamata banerjee, speaking to newsmen in kolkata on thursday. banerjee also demanded the resignation of chief minister buddhadeb bhattacharjee. ""the chief minister is also the home minister. he should own up and resign,"" banerjee said. meanwhile, the trinamul legislature party has decided to go for a 72-hour house boycott on friday, monday and tuesday. according to banerjee, ministers sheltering hardened criminals was a clear violation of constitutional duties. ""the centre can take action since the upholders of constitution have become its violators in west bengal,"" banerjee said. she added that salt lake disclosures, where armed criminals were found sheltered by ruling party politicians in state government-owned dormitories, had clearly vindicated her party's stand that the left front had been sponsoring criminal activities in the state. ""it is clear that state-sponsored terrorism is going on in west bengal. the left front has been rigging the elections using criminal elements and this has been exposed by the salt lake incident,"" the trinamul supremo said. banerjee pointed out that the salt lake incident was an outcome of cpm's internal bickerings where transport minister subhash chakrabarty has been made into a scapegoat. banerjee pointed out that congress leader kalpnath rai was convicted to 10 years' imprisonment by the supreme court because he had sheltered criminals in a government-owned guest house. there were striking similarity between the two incidents, banerjee felt.

5,Cong reacts sharply to criminals' arrest from stadium,"kolkata: the west bengal pradesh congress on thursday reacted sharply to the arrest of hardened criminals from kolkata's salt lake stadium. the party has demanded a thorough enquiry into the incident by a high court or supreme court judge. pradesh congress leaders, however, felt that there was no use demanding resignation of transport minister subhas chakrabarty or the chief minister as they should resign on their own. according to pradesh leader prodyut guha, such things have been going on in and around the salt lake stadium for quite some time. guha, who contested the parliamentary elections from the area in 1998, alleges that the same gang had worked against him to ensure his defeat. ""during the assembly elections this time, the same gang was instrumental in defeating congress-trinamul alliance candidate sujit bose. bose got defeated by subhas chakrabarty from salt lake,"" guha said. but guha went on to add that the incident at the salt lake stadium on wednesday night was an outcome of cpm's internal bickerings where subhas chakrabarty has been made a scapegoat. trinamul leader sujit bose, who was defeated by subhas chakrabarty in the last assembly elections, said that he had written to chief electoral officer sabyasachi sen immediately after the elections, drawing his attention to the presence of undesirable elements in the salt lake stadium who allegedly ""worked"" for subhas chakrabarty. bose said that he will be moving a public interest litigation. leader of opposition in west bengal assembly pankaj banerjee said that the left front was indulging in administrative terrorism in the state. he said that during their meeting with governor viren j. shah, they requested the governor to recall the government as it existed at his pleasure. banerjee said that letters will be sent to the president, the prime minister, the union home minister and congress president sonia gandhi, drawing their attention to the problem.

7,Committee for social justice a mere election stunt: Mulayam,"lucknow: samajwadi party president mulayam singh yadav on thursday termed the constitution of the committee for social justice as an election stunt of the rajnath singh government. he said that this was another ploy of the bjp to divide different communities for its own vested interests. yadav, who is being particularly targeted by the bjp, told the times of india that announcements of this nature were expected from a party which did politics in the name of religion, caste and class. ""whenever there is an election in the offing, the bjp rakes up one such issue. it was cow politics earlier but the party had to fall flat on its face when its members were found selling beef tallow. then came ram and the bjp eventually had to say ram-ram to it. the party waxed eloquent on desh bhakti and landed up with kargil. it extended an invitation to pakistani president parvez musharaff and has been at the receiving end since then. its latest stunt in the name of mbcs or extremely poor dalits will also not cut ice with the people for the electorate has seen through its gameplan,"" he said. the sp president minced no words when he said the rajnath singh government was trying to divert attention from its failures through such electoral gimmicks.""why is the government desisting from talking about the total collapse of the law and order situation in the state, the problems which are besieging the farming community, the common man or the student. the state of the power scenario is too well known. but nothing is being done or spoken on these counts, instead attempts are being made to create a wedge between people and communities,"" he said. yadav was categorical that raking up of such issues would have no impact on the electoral prospects of the sp as it had always championed the cause of the downtrodden and the oppressed, be they backwards or dalits.""the sp has established its presence in the urban sector also. people from all walks of life, be they lawyers, teachers or students, now identify themselves with the party. how can the constitution of such panels, with specific vested interest in mind, affect the sps electoral prospects,"" he said.

9,BJP demands special House session on law and order,"patna: the bjp on wednesday demanded convening of a special session of the state assembly to discuss the law and order situation in bihar and also suggest measures to control crime. charging the ruling rjd with extending patronage to criminals, the bjp president, nand kishore yadav, said that the incidents of loot, murder, kidnapping, massacre, rape and dowry deaths which had taken place in the state during the past 15 days indicated that there was no government at all in bihar with criminals unleashing a reign of terror. nand kishore, in a statement issued here on wednesday, said that the recent incidents of crime had made it clear that the rabri devi government had failed miserably in its efforts to control crime. lashing out at the congress party for giving a clean chit to the rabri government on the law and order front early this month, nand kishore said that the former was equally responsible for pushing the state towards disaster. the bjp leader charged the congress party with throwing its poll manifesto to the wind just to share power with the rjd. requesting the congress to withdraw its support to the rabri government, nand kishore said that during the past 24 hours alone, four persons were killed in lakhisarai, three persons, including two engineers were kidnapped in west champaran district while students of patna veterinary college not only assaulted their principal, dr mani mohan, on the college campus on tuesday, but also set his car afire causing him serious burn injuries. nand kishore said that apart from these major incidents, one ram ishwar rai was shot dead in barh while a trader narendra kumar was kidnapped at bakhtiyarpur in patna district during the past 24 hours. while maintaining that at least 15 incidents of extortion had taken place in patna during the past 15 days, nand kishore said that the rabri devi had lost the moral authority to continue in power even for a day. meanwhile, the bjp spokesperson, kiran ghai, and the chief whip of the party in the assembly, navin kishore prasad sinha, accused the ruling party ofencouraging government officials to misbehave with opposition leaders. he said that the fir lodged against the bjp mla from purnia, raj kishore kesri, by the local bdo, bishun dev prasad, was yet another evidence of it. he said that the government had not initiated any disciplinary action against the officials misbehaving with opposition leaders. the two leaders, however, also asked the public representatives to maintain restraint while interacting with government officials. talking to newsmen, the two senior bjp leaders said that kesri had moved a privilege notice against prasad in the assembly more than a year back in connection with the alleged irregularities in the implementation of indira awas yojana (iay) and assured employment schemes (aes) under purnia block. he said that prasad had not yet replied to the show cause notices served on him by the assembly secretariat in this connection. ghai and sinha demanded a high-level probe into the purnia incident as well as the alleged bungling in the implementation of iay and aes. they said that kesri had also lodged a case against prasad.

10,'Marandi govt has fallen short of expectations',"ranchi: speaker of the jharkhand legislative assembly inder singh namdhari had declared on the floor of the house in its opening session that ""jharkhand has learnt from the mistakes of bihar and would be different from its parent state"". seven months later, the speaker feels that jharkhand has left bihar far behind as far as corruption is concerned. in an interview namdhari, who appears to have taken upon himself the onus of fighting against the system, tells sonali das that ""there is still hope"". q. when you had spoken of jharkhand being different what was your vision of the state? a. by ""different"" i had meant an accelerated pace of development specially for the underprivileged by a clean, corruption-free government. q. seven months on, towards which direction you think the state is heading? a. the performance has certainly fallen short of expectations. the pace of corruption in developmental work is not only the same as that of bihar, but in some cases has left bihar far behind. q. could you be more specific? a. it is not that the entire bureaucracy is corrupt, but the number of clean babus is decreasing. at the level of deputy commissioners, corruption has reached its optimum level. with the sanction of the district head, block level engineers and officers are running amok indulging in largescale corruption affecting development projects. i am not pinpointing at any official. my attack is on the system as a whole. this cancer should have been nipped in the bud. still, i have urged the chief minister, babulal marandi, to send across a message to the bureaucracy and the people of the state, even through advertisements in newspapers, that corruption will not be tolerated at any level. q. but why have you singled out bureaucrats? are politicians in this state absolutely clean? a. the image of politicians has received enough battering, specially after the fodder scam and the tehelka expose. bangaru laxman was hanged for accepting rs 1 lakh only. q. so it is the amount that really matters? a. politicians, unless they are ministers or legislators, have no steady source of income. nor do they get salaries. as such, they have scope for accepting money from any agency or individual since they have to run an organization and can always take money in the name of party fund, like in tehelka or hawala case. but bureaucrats have been well protected with exorbitant salary packets, bungalows, perks and incentives and yet they indulge in corruption. q. are you really giving sanction to politicians for accepting graft money? a. no, it is just a comparative assessment. i am simply trying to put forth the fact that there is a growing sense of discontentment these days among bureaucrats who are getting more and more swayed by the razzmatazz of life or a hi-fi style. q. what is your assessment of politicians of jharkhand. a. i would not like to comment on that. right now, i will only say that weaknesses present in politicians of bihar is prevalent here, too. q. in this cleansing process, in what kind of role do you see yourself. a. i have been a fighter and i'm committed to the cause both as speaker and a peoples' representative. teaching is my passion. i would urge the government to make the educational environment tension-free so that teachers brood less on the number of cases against them and non-payment of salaries and more on imparting education. i still have hope. this is a period of transition and the state will finally emerge a winner.
