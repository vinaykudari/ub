0,Traders protest power cuts,"VARANASI: Traders and entrepreneurs, associated with the Uttar Pradesh Yuva Udyog Vyapar Mandal, staged a dharna at the district headquarters here on Monday in protest against the power crisis and the arbitrary functioning of trade-tax department.

The dharna was led by convener of the Varanasi division Mahesh Lal Jaisawal. Addressing a meeting held on the occasion, speakers alleged that traders were being unnecessarily harassed by the government machinery.

They said that owing to the lack of favourable atmosphere, entrepreneurs were compelled to migrate to other states. Urging the government to create a conducive atmosphere for the speedy industrial development of the state, they said that it was a must for checking the exodus of industrialists from Uttar Pradesh.

Later, they submitted a 10-point memorandum, addressed to chief minister Mayawati, to the district magistrate. Drawing the attention of the government authorities towards the power scenario, they said that that local industrialists were getting only ten-hour power supply daily. Exploitation of entrepreneurs by power officials was a common feature, they said adding that it had not adversely affected the industrial production in the state.

Terming the former UP chief minister Ram Prakash Gupta as a true sympathiser of traders and industrialists, they said that the government should all the major decision taken by him in the tradersâ€™ interests. They also urged the government to ensure that innocent traders should not be harassed by T-T officials.

Expressing concern at the deteriorating law and order situation in the state, the traders said that the government should clear their arms licence on priority basis so that they could purchase weapons for self-defence. They also demanded simplification of rules.

Prominent among those who took part in the dharna were state vice-president Suresh Agrawal, district incharge Sheshpal Garg, Mahendraraj Lonawat, Mukund Lal, Satyanaran Jindal, Radheshyam Mishra and Ravi Jaisawal.

1,Mayawati’s acumen on test in bypolls,"LUCKNOW: Chief minister Mayawatiâ€™s political acumen will be put on test during the bypolls to one parliamentary and four assembly seats in the state taking place on May 31.

These bypolls hold the key for smooth running of the BSP-BJP coalition, for Mayawatiâ€™s foremost requirement is to boost the confidence amongst the coalition partners, including the Rashtriya Lok Dal. Of the five seats, three had been won by the coalition partners and two by the opposition parties in the previous elections .

Akbarpur parliamentary and Jehangirganj assembly seats were won by Mayawati while Debai had returned Rashtriya Kranti Party supremo Kalyan Singh. Mayawati vacated her one assembly and one parliamentary seats, retaining Harora, and Kalyan Singh quit Debai. He had also won from Atrauli.

But the real test before the new administration is to tread cautiously in Kunda constituency. The seat, till now held by a former minister Raghuraj Pratap Singh popularly known as Raja Bhaiya, will go to the polls along with other constituencies.

The polling in Kunda was countermanded by the Election Commission on charges of rigging and other malpractices indulged in by Raja Bhaiya, an independent backed by the BJP. Here the former minister was facing a challenge from Yogendra Nath Mishra, a BSP nominee.

Now the chief minister will be required to carry along her partymen and also not to create a strain in the BSP-BJP ties. If she acquires a low profile and allows the former minister to win the seat without much effort, it will demoralise her flock of supporters, at least in Kunda and adjoining areas in Pratagarh district.

For Debai assembly seat the coming together of two heavyweights, Mulayam Singh Yadav and Kalyan Singh will pose serious challenge before the coalition. In view of the preponderance of the OBCs in this constituency and the easy victory secured by Raja Bhaiya in the assembly polls, the BSP-BJP combine faces a stiff challenge.

The results of Jehangiraganj and Akbarpur also hold importance for the coalition. On these two seats any perceptible fall in the votes polled by the BSP nominees will send a wrong message across the political spectrum, which may have an adverse impact on the coalition.

Of all the five seats, it is only at Baheri that the coalition does not have much at stake.

The seat was won by Manzoor Ahmed, a Samajwadi Party candidate in the previous elections, who was assassinated while sitting on a dharna before the Raj Bhawan. The BSP-BJP combine does not have to explain its supporters, even if it outrightly loses it, terming then the defeat to the sympathy factor.

2,SP raises cause of wheat farmers,"LUCKNOW: Terming the present government as anti-farmer, Samajwadi Party state president Ram Sharan Das said the farmers were being compelled to sell their wheat to middlemen and at a rate much lower than that fixed by the government. He said if the alleged bungling at the purchase centres were not stopped then the SP workers would launch an agitation against the same.

Addressing a press conference on Monday, Das said the government had spared no efforts in making public the knowledge that it had set up wheat purchase centres in large numbers all over the state. But the reports coming in from different districts had given a different picture. It was becoming increasingly apparent that many impediments were being deliberately placed in the path of the farmers compelling them to sell their produce to middlemen, he said.

Das said the distance between two purchase centres in many districts was between 10 to 15 kilometres, with the result that many small farmers were being forced to sell their wheat to middlemen.

Listing other problems being faced by the farmers, Das said there were no jute sacks and the farmers had to wait for many days to get payment of the stock sold by them.

He alleged that bungling was being done in the weighing of the wheat too.

3,Malin basti residents protest eviction order,"LUCKNOW: Several hundred citizens on Monday demonstrated outside the Lucknow Development Authority office against the eviction of the residents of Aishbagh Motijheel â€˜malin bastiâ€™.

The jhuggi had been there for the last 20-25 years. The demonstration was led by Farroukh Siddiqui and former MLA Banwari Lal Kanchal. Kanchal said that the assurance of the LDA to sell the plots to the jhuggi dwellers did not materialise, and the LDA to reverse its orders.

He threatened to launch a bigger demonstration shortly if the decision was not rolled back. The leaders of the protest also led a delegation to the LDA vice-chairman Diwakar Tripathi and handed over a 4-point charter of demands to him. Tripathi promised that no one would be displaced and assured them that everyone would be provided with an alternative land of 1,000 square feet each.

4,Kesari’s re-election to be unanimous,"LUCKNOW: The BJP-BSP coalition candidate Kesari Nath Tripathi will be declared elected formally as speaker of the 14th Vidhan Sabha unanimously on Tuesday at 1.00 pm as the Congress and the Rashtriya Krant Party (RKP) have proposed his candidature while the main opposition Samajwadi Party has announced not to oppose him.

Burying hachets to follow house traditions, the opposition did not field any candidate and allowed Tripathi to be re-elected speaker of the UP assembly unanimouly.

Chief minister Mayawati, RKP president Kalyan Singh and Congress legislature party leader Pramod Tiwari were among those who proposed Tripathiâ€™s name for the speakership. Although the Samajwadi Party did not propose or second Tripathiâ€™s name, it declared not to oppose his candidature, thus paving the way for his unanimous re-election.

â€œWe neither proposed nor seconded his name but we will not oppose him either to maintain the high traditions of the House even though the ruling coalition did not approach us for reaching a consensus,â€� rued the leader of the opposition in the UP assembly Azam Khan.

Meanwhile, 351 newly-elected members of the 14th Vidhan Sabha were administered the oath of office and secrecy by the pro-tem speaker Harishchandra Srivastava and a five-member panel comprising Kalyan Singh, Shyam Deo Roychowdhury, Ram Naresh Yadav, Virendra Singh and Kesari Nath Tripathi. Remaining members would be administered oath on Tuesday.

Prominent among those who took oath on Monday included Mayawati, Lalji Tandon, Hukum Singh, Swami Prasad Maurya, Ramveer Updhyayay, Sukdeo Rajbhar, Pramod Tiwari, Ram Naresh Yadav, Kokab Hamid, CLP Leader Pramod Tiwari, Leader of opposition Mohd. Azam Khan.

Earlier, on the initiative of leader of the opposition Azam Khan, all opposition parties held a meeting to chalk out a joint floor strategy to grill the BSP-BJP coalition government.

The opposition is likely to boycott governor Vishnukant Shashtriâ€™s address on May 15 as well as the trust vote by Mayawati government on May 17.

â€œChief minister Mayawati started on a discourteous note. She did not even have the courtesy to wish all members of the House today during the oath-taking ceremony. What should we expect from this government in future?â€� fumed Khan.

Despite this, Khan said, the opposition parties would maintain decorum and rich traditions of the House to play a positive and effective opposition. â€œThe opposition would cooperate with the treasury benches on issues concerning the people and development of the state but if it lost the track it would have to pay for it in the House,â€� warned Khan.

Meanwhile, BJP state president Kalraj Mishra and BJP legislature party leader Rajnath Singh claimed that Mayawati government would win the trust vote comfortably, assuring support of all BJP members in favour of the coalition government on May 17. â€œThere is no rebellion in the party and all members have agreed to support Mayawati,â€� stated Mishra.

5,Engineers protest bureaucratisation,"LUCKNOW: Around 4000 power engineers of the state boycotted their work from 3 to 5 pm on Monday in protest against the bureaucratisation of the Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Limited (UPPCL). They demanded the removal of the IAS officers and the posting of technocrats in their place.

In Lucknow, about 600 engineers boycotted their work and held a demonstration at the Shakti Bhawan. They raised anti-government slogans and called for an immediate transfer of the IAS officers from the Corporation. Later a meeting was held at the premises which was addressed by president and general secretary of the Uttar Pradesh Rajya Vidyut Parishad Abhiyanta Sangh AN Pandey and AK Singh respectively and the secretary general of the All India Power Federation Shailendra Dubey.

The speakers slammed the government for not keeping the interest of the power sector in mind by giving increased representation to the bureaucrats and by pursuing the policy of privatisation. They recounted the experiences of Orissa and Andhra Pradesh where similar experiments had been complete failures, the brunt of which was now being borne by the consumers.

The speakers said the work boycott was a complete success at Anpara, Obra, Panki, Parichcha, Harduaganj and Rihand power stations as also in the districts of Bareilly, Agra, Moradabad, Saharanpur, Kanpur and Jhansi etc.

reacting on the statement of chief minister Mayawati that no new privatisation would be done, the office-bearers said there was considerable ambiguity in the statement as it was not specified whether the four new distribution companies would be constituted and whether the government would go ahead with the privatisation of Kesco.

The union leaders further said that Mayawatiâ€™s appeal to the engineers to cooperate in the power sector reforms did not specify whether it meant following the â€˜diktatsâ€™ of the World Bank which had called for a dismemberment of the UPSEB, its corporatisation and privatisation.

They said the power situation could improve only when the bureaucrats were removed and the posts handed over to technocrats. They added the IAS officers had been appointed to complete the privatisation of the sector and warned that the engineers would not allow it to happen.

The central working committee of the Sangh would meet on Tuesday to chalk out its future strategy regarding its proposed strike.

6,17 of 24 arrested children set free,"LUCKNOW: Seventeen out of the 24 children arrested in the fake mineral water racket at the Charbagh railway station were released on Monday from the state juvenile home after arrest warrants against them were taken back.

The district administration, in a meeting on Sunday with the NGO â€˜Ankurâ€™ and representatives of CII and State Urban Development Authority (SUDA) decided to rehabilitate the children arrested by the GRP and sent to the state juvenile home. The NGO had pointed out that most of the children were not involved in selling fake mineral water. The NGO had also raised questions as to whether selling bottles without sealing them is a crime punishable with imprisonment.

Arvind Mishra of SUDA said that a separate place would be provided for the rehabilitation of these children so that they could be kept away from hardened juvenile criminals. The fund would also provide for their studies, food, medical care and clothing.

7,BSP minister’s remark against ex-CM irks BJP,"LUCKNOW: Hours after UP chief minister Mayawati denied reports of differences between the BSP and the BJP and claimed that all was well with the coalition, the reported remark of excise minister Naseemuddin Siddiqui against the excise policy initiated by Rajnath Singh has provoked sharp reaction from BJP leaders. Sources say, despite the denial by Behenji there was resentment in â€œcertain section of the BJP on the way the BSP ministers were going public on various issues regarding the previous governmentâ€�.

A section of the media had quoted the minister of accusing the Rajnath Singh government of sewing up a liquor policy in 2000-2001 which caused a loss of Rs 700 crore. Taking umbrage at the remarks, Singh is learnt to have given a piece of his mind to BJP leaders in the state cabinet who were asked to communicate his displeasure to Behenji. Sources close to Singh confirmed this and told Times News Network that the BSP leaders have been asked to follow the coalition dharma and keep away from making snide remarks on the previous government.

When contacted, Rajnath Singh refused to be drawn into the controversy he said that all through his tenure he did â€œall he could to bring in revenue and to keep the liquor mafia at bayâ€�. Sources say that the issue had also been taken up with the â€œarchitects of the coalitionâ€� with a request that things be sorted out at the earliest. It was this terse missive, a leader said, that prompted Mayawati to issue a clarification at a press conference on Sunday regarding policies of the previous BJP government.

Excise officials say that the new minister was seriously applying his mind to undo a major portion of the current excise policy which has done away with the auction regime and brought in open licensing. â€œThe liberalisation of the sector had thrown open the market for all-round competition and had checked the liquor cartel,â€� said an official. Circumspect officials now say that in case the policy is reversed the liquor lobby would once again be controlling major â€˜power gamesâ€™. The minister was not available for comments.

8,Marandi calls on villagers to monitor development,"DHANBAD: Jharkhand chief minister Babulal Marandi on Sunday pleaded for new experiments to improve the present deplorable condition of the primary and middle school-level education.

Addressing a mammoth gathering at Sahraj under the Govindpur block of the district, about 30-km from here, the chief minister said that despite better pay and facilities, the condition of government schools was not better than the private schools which is a matter of concern. He was here to lay the foundation stone of Chetna Mahavidyalaya, being started by ""Digant"", an NGO, in this one of the most backward adivasi area.

Lauding the role of NGOs in the field of development, especially in the rural sector, the chief minister said that it is not possible for any government to look after each and every thing and called upon the villagers to take charge of the developmental works. There are schools in the villages but the teachers remain absent. The villagers will have to take care of it, he said and announced that the government is working on a proposal to give power to appoint teachers to village bodies to improve the situation. The government will provide all the infrastructural facilities for improvement in the field of education but the village body will have to see to it that the schools run properly, he said.

Amidst thunderous applause, the CM announced to provide cycles to every school-going child of scheduled caste and scheduled tribe community who is facing difficulty in going to school.

Exhorting the village folks, especially the youths, to strive for self-development, the CM said that it is not possible to provide government job to every youth. The population of the state is about 2.75 crore and vacancies in all the government departments are not more than 25,000. Even if all the vacant posts are filled, it cannot ensure development of the state, he opined.

He called upon the public to support the government in its endeavour to abolish corruption from the state and announced that keeping in view the problem being faced by the poor public, the government has decided to pay Rs 20,000 directly to the persons concerned for construction of houses under the Indira Awas Yojana. The DCs and BDOs not abiding by this government decision will be put under suspension.

Talking about unavailability of drinking water in parts of the state, the CM wondered that there are about two lakh handpumps in 32,000 villages of the state but even then the villagers are facing drinking water problem. He said that 28,000 new handpumps would be installed in the state in the current financial year. Industries minister P N Singh, Sindri MLA Phoolchand Mandal, founder of ""Digant"", Shailendra, Dr S N Rana, Biren Tudu, Prasoon Hembrom, Thakur Prasad Murmu were important among others who addressed the function.

Later, talking to mediapersons at Dhanbad circuit house, the CM refuted the allegations that the transfers of IPS officers are made under any political pressure. He refused to acknowledge that there are any differences in the NDA and said that the difference of opinion between some of the constituents will be sorted out within the alliance.

9,Central govt lab may stop drug sample tests,"PATNA: Central Indian Pharmacopial Laboratory (CIPL), Ghaziabad, a Central government laboratory, has asked the state government to clear its dues of about Rs 3.47 lakh by May 31, failing which it would not accept the samples of seized drugs, suspected to be spurious or fake, sent to it by drug inspectors for chemical test.

State drug controller Sangeet Kumar Sinha admitted that the government had not cleared the CIPL dues for the last three financial years. He said that he would request the health authorities to make an annual budgetary provision of Rs 1.25 lakh under the laboratory test head. It would also help the department to clear the dues of other Central government laboratories. The drug inspectors have to send the samples of seized drugs to CIPL for tests as the drug testing laboratory of the state governme-nt, located in Agamkuan, lacks infrastructural facilities to conduct tests. Interestingly, the drug control wing of the health department did not bother to inform the health authorities about the CIPL dues in three years. He said the samples would not be required to sent outside once the Agamkuam laboratory developed facilities for tests.

to conduct all the tests. He said that the Centre had supplied several sophisticated instruments to Agamkuan laboratory free of cost. The instruments are being installed, he said.

Sinha said that he would request the CIPL authorities to keep testing the drug samples sent to it by the state government even after May 31 in view of the positive steps being initiated by the state government to clear its dues.

10,Seamen protest over PF scam,"MUMBAI:The National Union of Seafarers of India staged a morcha at the office of the Provident Fund Commisioner of Seamen at Ballard Estate on Monday in the wake of the Rs 100-crore provident fund scam.

General secretary of the union Abdul Ghani Sarange met PF commissioner Naresh Salecha and director- general of shipping D.T. Joseph and conveyed the seamenâ€™s anxiety about their provident fund.

Both Mr Salecha and Mr Joseph allayed all fears on this account and gave in writing to Mr Ghani that no seaman would lose his provident fund.

They also said that any person from the maritime community could claim his provident fund which would be given to him in 15 days.

Organiser of the National Union of Seafarers of India Suresh Naik said,â€�even though the seamen donâ€™t stand to lose anything immediately, what will happen some years down the line? What will happen if all the seamen decided to claim their provident fund? (looking at the scenario, quite a few of them are thinking of leaving the job and claim their provident funds) Does the commissionerate have enough funds to tackle such an eventuality?â€™â€™

Mr Joseph replied that the office had enough funds for any eventuality and would ensure that no seaman lost his hard-earned money. â€œWe are not complacent, but Rs 100 crore is a big amount and we will investigate the matter thoroughly,â€™â€™ said Mr Joseph.

11,Cong stalled development work: SAD,"MUKTSAR: Former Punjab chief minister and Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Parkash Singh Badal has charged the Amarinder Singh government with stopping all the development programmes initiated by the SAD-BJP during its rule.

â€˜â€˜The SAD-BJP government did its best to put the state on the path of development,â€™â€™ Badal told mediapersons here, on Sunday, while presiding over a school function. He criticised the Congress government for its failure to fulfil election promises.

About the Punjab Public Service Commission (PPSC) recruitment scam, Badal said Ravinder Paul Singh Sidhu was appointed by the then Congress government and even his touts did maximum to benefit the Congress party supporters. â€˜â€˜The SAD-BJP government has nothing to do with the scam,â€™â€™ he said.

Badal was also critical of the working of Vigilance bureau for what he called unnecessary harassment of every section in the state. The SAD supremo lambasted the Congress government for launching a special drive of recovery of crop and other loans, which caused harassment to the common people. He also expressed concern over deteriorating law and order situation in the state.

On Gujarat, he said protection of life and property was the primary duty of the state government. He also opposed any proposal of sending Punjab police personnel or the commando battalion to deal with the situation in Gujarat as â€˜â€˜such steps will create hatred towards Punjabisâ€™â€™.

12,No party symbol for BSP in MC polls,"Jalandhar: It appears as if the traditional political parties here are being slowly phased out by the independent candidates during the Municipal Corporation level election process.

The evidence of it is the recent instructions given by the party high command of BSP to its local unit to not to use its official symbol of elephant for the forthcoming Jalandhar MC elections.

Infighting and lack of leadership is being cited as reasons for the unpopularity of mainstream parties. Observers opine that BSPâ€™s decision of not using its official symbol is a reflection of the partyâ€™s mood of depression after its poor performance in the last assembly elections.

But its not only the BSP which is not using its official symbol, even the CPI has given instructions to its local unit forbidding the use of sickle and hammer symbol. Asked why the BSP was not using its elephant symbol, which was used in the last assembly elections, Pawan Tinnu, a member of the BSP selection committee, who contested the last two assembly elections without being successful, said, â€œThese are instructions from the top. Beyond that we cannot comment.â€� No wonder the BSP mood reflects in the number of candidates it has put up despite the large per cent of dalit vote in Jalandhar city.

While the Akali Dal has fielded 20 candidates, the BJP 32, the BSP has fielded only 3 candidates, who are not allowed to use the elephant symbol.

The non-use of the official party symbol has already started to cause confusion among voters.â€œAre they trying to hide their alliance with the upper caste BJP,â€� asked Anil Kumar, who lives in Basti Naun. A total of 275 have entered the fray for the municipal corporation elections and out of these 55 are from the Congress and 55 from the new SAD-BJP-BSP alliance.

This leaves a total of 165 independent candidates. Seeing that its rank and file stand divided, the BJP it is learnt, is secretly planning to strengthen the Hindutva factor in the coming elections. While the Congress has started on a discordant note as local MLAs are annoyed with the Jalandhar MP Balbir Singh and the Jalandhar district urban president, Tejinder Bittu, who is said to have been the main advisor on distribution of tickets.

Allegations of money exchanging hands are also flying thick in the air. Sources said the local MLAs Avtar Henry and Mohinder Singh Kaypee have already expressed their anger over the arbitrary distribution of tickets by Balbir Singh and Tejinder Bittu. Sources said that a number of rebel candidates have already filed their nominations.

13,HC issues directive on Ludhiana polls,"CHANDIGARH:The Punjab government has been directed by the Punjab and Haryana High Court to consider expeditiously the representation of April 24, 2002 of petitioners Baljeet Singh and others from Ludhiana, seeking to quash the notification of 1996 pertaining to reservation of seats for those belonging to the scheduled castes in the municipal corporation, Ludhiana.

The division bench of justices Jawahar Lal Gupta and N K Sud, while not issuing notice to the respondents, disposed of the writ petition with directions to take the decision on the representation preferably within two months.

The petitioners had contended that though representations to state authorities had been made to revise the number of seats reserved for the scheduled castes in view of increase in their voter population, nothing was done to correct the imbalance in seats which should be 11 instead of eight at present out of a total of 70 seats.

The polling for the general elections to the four municipal corporations of Ludhiana, Jalandhar, Amritsar and Patiala is scheduled to be held on May 19.

14,Snoopy to market insurance policy,"KOLKATA: For private insurance company MetLife India, children make a lot of business sense. And it wants to keep them amused. Following its American parent Metropolitan Life Insurance Companyâ€™s footsteps, the Indian venture is using Snoopy â€” the comic strip character created by Charles Schulz â€” to extend a hand of friendship to youngsters.

â€œIn the US, Snoopy has been used by MetLife since 1983-84 and today, 98 per cent of Americans associate Snoopy with MetLife. We wish to create a similar recall value in India,â€� MetLife Indiaâ€™s Venkatesh S. Mysore told TNN.

He admitted that the task had been easy in the US because an entire generation had grown up there with the lovable, warm and honest characters of Peanuts. In India, only a few newspapers carry the cartoon strip.

â€œWe will make it popular through hoardings and newspaper advertisements,â€� Mysore said.

To bring more children closer to Snoopy, MetLife plans contests in schools and colleges with gifts like Snoopy caps, T-shirts and pencils.

â€œEven for customersâ€™ children, we have a variety of paraphernalia including pins and crayons. For our recruits and customers, there are tie-pins and money clips,â€� Mysore added.

â€œWe used Snoopy in all our launch programmes at five-star hotels across the country. Amazingly, children always turned up without invitation to play with him. The attraction is spontaneous,â€� he recalled.

While the association with Snoopy may not translate into sales given the adage â€œinsurance is always sold, not boughtâ€�, MetLife plans to use the dog as its brand ambassador to create an affinity between families and the company. Of course, it will bank on the rub-off effect that make parents prefer what their children like.

The company is also working on two policies for children and hope to submit them for clearance by the Insurance Regulatory Development Authority.

MetLifeâ€™s agents will also use Snoopy to relate the companyâ€™s 130-year-old history that has made it the number one insurer in the American market with annual premium business standing at $285 billion.

â€œWe think we have a great story to tell â€” of the commitments that were kept during the two World Wars, a civil war and the Great Depression. Snoopy exudes a warm, fuzzy feeling that adds to the sense of trust,â€� he added.

15,Women protest Gujarat atrocities,"KOLKATA: Reports of mass brutalisation of women in Gujarat have moved womenâ€™s groups in the city into action. The umbrella organisation Maitree took out a candlelight procession in central Kolkata on Monday evening. Earlier, on Saturday, a meeting organised by womenâ€™s magazine Ahalya at the University Institute resolved to fight communalism in all spheres including school education.

â€œThe survivors of the holocaust have recounted to fact-finding teams how sections in the police had joined in the violence against women while a biased administration turned a blind eye,â€� said Maitree organisers, supporting the demands of for immediate filing of FIRs and setting up special courts to try the perpetrators.

There were also silver linings, they noted, in the courage and humanity of some ordinary Hindu women and men who had sheltered their hounded Muslim neighbours and relief workers.

The experiences of numerous women were cited in a report prepared by women activists Syeeda Hamid, Malini Ghosh, Ruth Monorama and Sheba George on behalf of Citizensâ€™ Initiative, the NGO forum running relief camps in Gujarat.

Kulsum Bibi at Shah-e-Alam camp in Ahmedabad witnessed mass rape, even of minor girls, at Naroda Patia on February 28. â€œThe mob started chasing us with burning tyres after we were forced to leave Gangotri Society. It was then that they raped many girls including minors. We saw about 8-10 rapes. Most of those girls were burnt to death,â€� she told the team. She also identified the rapists.

FIRs were not registered even where the victims survived. Sultani, a rape survivor of Eral village, Kalol taluka, Panchmahals district, was one of them. She was escaping in a Tempo with others, but the vehicle overturned. She was caught and raped repeatedly. â€œAll the while I could hear my son crying.â€� Sultani had not undergone a medical examination. No FIR had been filed though a written statement had been submitted to the DSP. In her statement, she named some men from the mob.

According to the team, the crimes against women have been grossly under-reported. For instance, in Panchmahals district, only one FIR on rape has been filed.

The situation is compounded by the apathy of the law-enforcement agencies and the politicians.

Even the middle-class educated women became part of the communal orgy. The investigators found a BJP MLA, though a woman herself, indifferent to complaints of gang-rape of minor girls.

16,Mamata held hostage in her party,"KOLKATA: The eagerness of the Trinamul Congress to return to the Centre has claimed its first casualty and it is none other than party chief Mamata Banerjee herself. So harassed was she, that she even offered to quit electoral politics, claimed insiders.

With the Trinamul prospect of securing a berth in the Union ministry becoming brighter, the parliamentary party is witnessing one of its worst back-room politics. While there is no ambiguity regarding Mamata, it is the second ministerial berth that has put her in a spot.

In fact, the recent move by the party to have the anti-defection Act invoked against rebel MP Ajit Panja is an indication of the inner squabbles. The move to punish him had been orchestrated by Trinamul parliamentary party chief whip Sudip Bandyopadhyay to bolster his chances of becoming a minister, said some leaders.

Panja, despite being suspended from the party, remains a front-runner as the Trinamulâ€™s second choice. If his chances are scuppered after being implicated under the anti-defection law, there will be one less contender. Moreover, he is a favourite of the BJP for his unflinching support for the PM.

Some Trinamul leaders felt that there should be a rapprochement between Mamata and Panja. â€œIt has become difficult because the difference between the two has taken the shape of an ego clash,â€� pointed out Trinamul MLA Jyoti Priya Mallick.

According to him, if Panja had been rehabilitated, Mamata would have been saved from the constant pressures she is being subjected to by the other MPs. Others like Akbar Ali Khondekar, Bikram Sarkar, Nitish Sengupta, Ananda Mohan Biswas and Ranjit Panja are all eager to become ministers. Some have even opened a direct line with the BJP, added insiders.

Also, in an effort to assuage ruffled feathers, Trinamul leader Pankaj Banerjee has invited North 24-Parganas stalwart Bhupen Seth and Idris Ali to resolve matters. Both had expressed their desire to quit the party.

Trinamul Congress flays Sikdar for opposing tie-up: Trinamul Congress on Monday criticised BJP leader and Union minister Tapan Sikdar for his statement that his party would not enter into any tie up with the Trinamul for the next panchayat poll in the state and dubbed it as his â€˜personal viewâ€™.

Commenting on Sikdar''s statement at Malda on Sunday, Trinamul Congress General Secretary Partha Chatterjee said the BJP central and state leadership did not make any such comment opposing tie up between the two NDA partners for the next yearâ€™s rural poll. â€œIt may be Sikdarâ€™s personal view,â€� the Trinamul leader said.

The BJP leaderâ€™s comment came close on the heels of the party central leadership forcing its state unit not to field candidate for the Onda Assembly by-poll slated for May 31. State BJP led by Ashim Ghose, a close confidente of Sikdar, wanted to put up its own nominee and had recommended the name of Gunamoy Chatterjee for the seat which fell vacant following the death of Anil Mukherjee of Forward Bloc.

The state unit, however, backed out following the directive from the party high command but made its support to Trinamul candidate conditional.

â€œWe will extend full cooperation to Trinamul candidate in Onda by-election, if they supported us in election to some civic bodies going to polls on May 26,â€� state BJP vice-president Muzaffar Khan said.

17,Trinamul protest a damp squib,"KOLKATA: The Trinamul Congressâ€™s decision to observe May 13 as Black Day turned out to be a damp squib as party leaders failed to make any impact at all with their demonstrations. It was on this day last year that the Left Front had romped home to power for the sixth time.

The Trinamul leadership had decided to hold demonstrations in the city and the districts on Monday. Leaders and workers were also told to sport black badges as a mark of protest. But with most of the leadership out of town, not much enthusiasm was witnessed nor was the black badge visible.

Local Trinamul leaders demonstrated in front of the Tiljala police station against the beating up of a woman activist allegedly by CPM and RSP cadres. On Saturday, nearly 250 CPM and RSP cadres from the Sonarpur Assembly segment had joined the Trinamul. Trouble broke out when Dipali Das, who had also joined the Trinamul, was attacked allegedly by the Ganatantrik Mahila Samity. A little later, CPM local committee member Barun Sil also joined in and Das was severely beaten up and had to be admitted to National Medical College.

""The new management of Balco - Sterlite, is unnecessarily changing service rules for over 5,000 employees and exploiting them by paying less wages than what is stipulated"", General Secretary of Balco Karmachari Sangh Rajendra Mishra alleged.

About 40 per cent production units and departments were closed down and the employees were afraid that either they would be dismissed or transferred, he said.

He charged the new management of violating the Factory Act by scrapping the old rule of paying double the wage per hour for retaining any worker for more than eight hours.

In departments like alumina and pigcasting, instead of deploying sufficient work force, an employee was forced to do three persons'' job. According to the guidelines of the service rule, if the management wanted to downsize the work force then it would have to open voluntary retirement scheme, Mishra claimed.

Sterlite has 51 per cent stake in the company while the Centre holds the remaining shares.

26,Is BCC blind to building law violations?,"BANGALORE: â€¢ A huge commercial building is coming up in Rustom Bagh Layout, behind Manipal Hospital, in violation of law - the sanctioned plan is for residential purpose. Residents approach the civic body and register their complaint.

Status: Zero result; the construction activity is in full swing.

â€¢ A resident of Tulsiram Dass Mutt Road in Frazer Town constructs first and second floor on the pretext of changing his ground floor roof, without any further plan sanctions. The BCC has done its job by issuing two notices to its builder!

â€¢ A five-storeyed Kalyana Mantap has been built on 8th cross Malleswaram. It lacks the setback areas and parking slot shown in the plan has been used up. The builder has also not obtained a NoC from residents. Complaints have been registered with the BCC as also the Lok Ayukta.

The BCC''s public grievance cell receives more than 60 complaints each day, of which 80 per cent pertain to illegal constructions. However, not even 10 per cent of such complaints are dealt with.

According to the official sources, intervention from corporators and MLAs has forced the BCC to turn a blind eye towards violations.

``It''s an unwritten rule in Jayanagar, Chamarajpet and Binnypet constituencies that the BCC cannot touch a single violator of law without the respective MLA''s permission,'''' officials said.

For instance, the builder in Rustom Bagh Layout, a purely residential colony inhabited by scientists at NAL and software engineers, has got an exclusive transformer installed at his premises which is a threat to the neighbouring houses. The agitated residents have written to none other than the Chief Minister, but in vain.

As per the statistics collected by BCC, Chickpet, Chamarajpet, Gandhinagar, Koramangala, Shantinagar, Richmond Town, Shivajinagar, Padmanabhanagar and Jayanagar are areas having the highest number of unchecked deviations.

Even BCC Commissioner M.R. Sreenivasa Murthy had acknowledged that ``unauthorised construction is one of the grave problems faced by Bangaloreans.''''
