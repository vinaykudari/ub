0,IIT incentives to meet competition,"KOLKATA: Responding to competition from overseas technology schools, IIT Kharagpur on Thursday announced a slew of student incentive schemes including a venture capital fund for scholarships and augmentation in its undergraduate seat strength.

Chairman of the board of governors of the country''s oldest technology school Sanjeev Goenka told a press conference here that the venture capital with seed money of Rs 10 lakh had been formed to sponsor two students annually.

1,Subway closure causes inconvenience,"PUNE: Pedestrians, particularly schoolchildren from the Modern high school, have been risking their lives for the last 15 days to cross the busy J M road, as the G M Bhosale subway is closed for dearth of security personnel.

Pedestrians said that the Pune municipal corporation (PMC) had been turning deaf ear to their complaints. A Modern school teacher told TNN that the school had informed the PMCâ€™s ward officer about the inconvenience caused by the subwayâ€™s closure.

â€œThe ward officer said the PMC would appoint a security personnel in the next two days,â€� she said. Shraddha Gaikwad, who stays near the subway, said during the peak of the monsoon, water seepage hampered its use.

However, the PMCâ€™s development engineer-cum-traffic planner, Srinivas Bonala, assured there would be no water seepage or technical pitfalls in the subway this year.

â€œLast year, there was water seepage due to a ruptured underground water line. We have rectified the problem,â€� he said. The subway would be reopened in the next two days, Bonala said.

3,"Pandya was in mob, claims riot witness","AHMEDABAD: A witness deposing before the Nanavati-Shah commission, probing the communal riots in Gujarat, created a sensation on Thursday, claiming former home minister Haren Pan-dya was in the mob which attacked housing societies in the Paldi area, Ahmedabad, on February 28 2002.

The witness, Yunus Bhavnagri, a dentist, claimed that Pandyaâ€™s presence made the police ignore the SOS calls of Muslims residing in Paldi area of the slain ministerâ€™s Ellisbridge constituency.

Pandya was gunned down in the Law Garden area on March 26, in what was seen as a reprisal killing by some radical groups.

Bhavnagri had fired at the rioting mob on the day of the VHP bandh on February 28 last year, killing two persons, apparently in self-defence. He told Justice G T Nanavati (Retd) and Justice (Retd) K G Shah that he saw Pandya in the mob. â€˜â€˜This was probably the reason why the police despite being present at the site turned a deaf ear to all cries for help,â€™â€™ he said.

Bhavnagari said the mobs went on rampage in the area around 2 pm, burning shops and houses and indulging in heavy stone-pelting. â€˜â€˜The police who were present at the spot not only allowed the mob a free hand but also gave them a helping hand by firing and lobbying tear gas on residents,â€™â€™ Bhavnagari said.

The dentist alleged that his son Amir was hit on the chest by a bullet. â€˜â€˜Even after that we were arrested and locked up in jail as I fired upon the mob in self-defence with my licensed revolver.â€™â€™

He informed the commission that the residents went through hell for almost four hours and it was only around 6 pm that they heaved a sigh of relief when the deputy police commissioner VM Pargi arrived with a sizable force and dispersed the mob. The police later took the residents to hospital for first-aid and medical assistance.

Bhavnagri would be cross-examined on Friday. He made his deposition on the second day of the hearing on the Ahmedabad incidents. However, police officers, on being contacted, claimed that even during the the hearing of Bhavnagariâ€™s bail application, it had been clarified that Pandya was present there only to save the residents from the mob.

5,BJP to contest Delhi assembly polls on its own,"LUCKNOW: The Bharatiya Janata Party will contest Delhi assembly elections on its own, projecting Madan Lal Khurana as chief minister, said Union labour minister Sahib Singh Verma on Thursday. Verma said that his party was sure to capture power in Delhi.

Talking to reporters, Verma said that his party did not need any ally for the Delhi polls and would like to go on its own. When reminded of BSP''s resolve to enter the poll alone, Verma said that Mayawati was welcome to join the fray but the BJP did not need any help to win there. He, however, said that he would continue to play an active roll in Delhi politics, irrespective of his placements. ""Even before the assembly elections, Delhi will get the status of an independent state,"" Verma said.

He also refuted the allegations of Delhi chief minister Sheila Dixit that the Central government was not allowing a free hand to her government. This was far from true, he said, adding that Sheila Dixit always enjoyed much more power than others. But the Delhi chief minister was known for making a hue and cry for small things, said the labour minister.

6,Cong wants dismissal of TDP govt,"

HYDERABAD: Congress MP and party secretary Mani Shankar Aiyar on Thursday demanded the dismissal of TDP government under Article 356 for violating the statute by implementing Janmabhoomi as a parallel programme to the panchayat raj system and denying powers to elected representatives.

Addressing the media at the conclusion of the Congress Rashtra Panchayat Raj and Nagar Palika sadassu, Aiyar said that even the report on the parliamentary standing committee on urban and rural development â€” comprising MPs from all political parties â€” condemned Janmabhoomi in no uncertain terms.

Cautioning people on the â€˜deadlyâ€™ combination of TDPâ€™s Janmabhoomi and BJPâ€™s Ram Janmabhoomi, the Congress leader said that a reinforced public interest litigation was the only and immediate answer to stop the unconstitutional action promoted by the TDP government to further its party cadre and their interests.

â€œThe right way to teach a lesson to the TDP for its unconstitutional act is to get justice through the courts and then go to people during elections to achieve rural development and local self-governance,â€� Aiyar said.

Janmabhoomi violates schedule 11 and 12 (73rd and 74th amendments) of the Constitution that gives freedom to the state governments to devolve powers to panchayats and autonomous bodies, he said and observed that â€œchief minister Naidu is not a human being, but a rhinoceros that cannot absorb criticism. He is ignoring the Constitution that has given him a chance to come to power through a democratic system.â€�

He took objection to the nomination of nodal officers to perform the role supposed to be executed by elected panchayats and also for using Janmabhoomi as the partyâ€™s political tool.

Earlier, at the day-long convention, the party took the state government to task for â€œneglectingâ€™â€™ panchayat raj institutions and â€œencouragingâ€™â€™ nodal officers to implement government programmes.

The convention on panchayat raj institutions was attended by over 3,000 delegates from across the state attended. AICC chief spokesman S Jaipal Reddy said Naidu was a â€˜Bakasura,â€™ who was â€œeating away all the powers of the panchayat institutions.â€™â€™

â€œThe time has come to finish the demon and save the system,â€� he said. Reddy then threw an open challenge to Naidu to visit any of the Congressruled states and inspect the powers conferred on the panchayat raj institutions and compare them with Andhra Pradesh.

CLP leader Y S Rajasekhara Reddy, in his speech, condemned the recent suspension of sarpanches for not being able to maintain hygiene in villages.

â€œThe government has been usurping the funds of the local bodies and diverting it through the nodal officers system. The sarpanches were directly elected by the people and suspending them is not the right thing to do,â€� he said.

PCC president M Satyanarayana Rao criticised the chief minister for â€œwasting fundsâ€™â€™ through the Janmabhoomi programmes and neglecting the democratically elected local body representatives.

Hundreds of crores of rupees were being pocketed by the ruling party leaders in the name of undertaking developmental works in the villages, Satyanarayana Rao said.

7,Cell to monitor govt recruitments mooted,"HYDERABAD: The panel on GO 610 on Thursday recommended constituting a monitoring cell to prevent any violation of rules in government recruitments.

This recommendation was approved unanimously at the meeting of House Committee on GO 610. All recruitments and transfers in government departments would be subject to clearance by cell.

According to sources, the Committee also asked the law secretary to be present at its next meeting to look into the violations of zonal recruitments in the law department.

The law department had earlier contended that the judiciary did not come in the purview of the House Committee. But the members raised objection to this, pointing out that the judiciary is part of the Constitution and has to abide by the Presidential Order. The House Committee will meet again on July 29 and August 11.

Sources added that the home department officials have submitted details of non-locals recruited in constable posts in Hyderabad city police (zone-VI).

It said that there were 3,344 non-local constables out of a total 4,722. However, it was observed that against the 3,344 non-locals, 1,597 constables were recruited from within the region, which also amounts to violation of zonal recruitment rules.

Meanwhile, Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) member Chandrasekhar Rao submitted petitions to the Committee chairman Prakash Reddy urging him to get details of employees of different cadre working in the Secretariat, medical and health departments, Telugu Academy, AP Administrative Tribunal and other heads of departments like directorates and comissionerates, which do not fall under the purview of zonal recruitment.

He reportedly said the locals should get a fair share of posts.

8,'Govt alive to law and order situation',"PATNA: The state government on Thursday informed the assembly that apart from chalking out an action plan to prevent kidnappings for ransom, it had also constituted a standing committee headed by the chief secretary and a joint action team headed by the home secretary to stop anti-national activities in the areas bordering Nepal.

Panchayati raj minister Upendra Prasad Verma said that the government had decided to set up a police academy in the state during the current financial year. He said that under the centrally-sponsored jail reforms programme approved last year by the Centre, Rs 179.43 crore would be spent on improving the condition of various jails during the next five years.

Verma said the NDA members should not forget that Samajwadi Party MP Phoolan Devi was shot dead in Delhi outside her residence a couple of years back. The Bihar government had, on the other hand, arrested Ranvir Sena chief Barmeshwar Singh. He said that efforts were being made to break the nexus between MCC and Nepali Maoists.

Holding the Centre responsible for the rise of extremism in Bihar, Verma said during the last few years the Centre had supplied 200 SLRs only to the state though it had demanded 5,000 SLRs.

Verma said that under the action plan chalked out to prevent kidnappings for ransom, the government had ordered for arrest of the accused, attachment of their movable and immovable assets, cancellation of their bail, police verification of their bailers and speedy trial of cases in which chargesheets had been filed.

Referring to the police modernisation programme, he said that the Centre had sanctioned over Rs.115.17 crore for it in March 2001 and the execution of the programme began during 2001-02. The government had so far released Rs 50 crore for the construction of police station buildings, police lines, residential quarters for policemen and purchase of sophisticated equipments.

He said that another Rs 108 crore would be made available to the police during 2003-04 for the establishment of district information centres, district control rooms and barricading of police stations, construction of police stations and quarters for policemen.

The House passed the budgetary demands in the absence of NDA, CPI and CPI-ML members who had staged a walkout when Verma was half-way through his reply.

Earlier, moving a cut motion, chief whip of the BJP Navin Kishore Prasad Sinha severely criticised the functioning of the intelligence and CID wings of the police.

10,"Govt didn't know of MCC plan, says minister","PATNA: The state government had no prior information about any plan of the banned ultra leftist outfit, Maoist Communist Centre (MCC), to damage railway tracks at four places during the Mithilanchal bandh programme to disrupt train services.

Labour minister Upendra Prasad Verma, while replying to a call attention motion of Ganga Prasad (BJP) and Kedar Pandey (CPI), said in the state legislative council that for the first time MCC has changed its mode of action. Earlier, they used to target the police. Now, they have targeted the railway tracks, he said.

11,Himachal govt to make labour registration compulsory,"SHIMLA: Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh on Friday said the government would issue instructions making it compulsory for labourers to get themselves.

Talking to newspersons here on his return after visiting the cloudburst-affected areas in the Gursa valley, he said the government would ensure in future that labour engaged by private contractors are provided proper shelter and are not made to live in sheds along the banks of the rivers and nullahs.

He said employers would have to issue proper identity cards their work force. ""The copy of the identity card will also be sent to the labour department,"" he added.

Thanking the ITBP for providing assistance in the rescue operations and lauding the district administration for doing a good job, the chief minister said directions had been issued that all roads, paths and bridges in the valley which had been damaged or destroyed in the flash floods be restored on priority basis.

Giving details, he said the labourers were living in four camps in the devastated area, of which one camp which had 30 people was the worst affected. Agriculture minister Raj Krishan Gaur had been rushed to the area on the same day to supervise the rescue and relief operations personally, he added.

12,"With polls round the corner, BJP banks on Vajpayee","RAIPUR: If party president M Venkaiah Naidu''s speech on the opening day of the Bhartiya Janata Party''s three-day national executive meeting here on Friday is any indicator, the Prime Minister remains the party''s USP as it gets into election mode.

Naidu spoke at length on Vajpayee''s achievements on the foreign policy front, his responsiveness to policy suggestions from the party, his ``caring, compassionate'''' government, and the ``contrast he presents to the Congress'' Sonia Gandhi.

Having singed himself once with the ``twin leader'''' theory, Naidu was careful to emphasise that Vajpayee -- as in the last elections -- would remain at the heart of the party''s electoral campaign.

Sample the Naiduspeak, ``...there is perhaps no precedent for a PM to remain as popular as...Atalji is after five years in the saddle.

``The starkest contrast between the BJP and the Congress is in the area of leadership. We have a leader in...Atalji, who is not only the leader of the BJP, not only the leader of the NDA, but also the leader of the entire nation. On the other hand, the Congress can do is to take shelter under the dynasty.''''

Naidu''s message was aimed as much at his own party colleagues as it was for the citizens of Chhatisgarh, one of the four key states going to the polls later this year. It is the only one where the party has been unable to project a chief ministerial candidate and is relying on Vajpayee''s persona to pull it through.

But equally, it was targeted at the party''s comrades in the Sangh Parivar and partners in the NDA. In the run-up to the 2004 general elections, Naidu declared that though Hindutva was the soul of India, ``it cannot be an election issue''''.

He said that Hindutva could not be projected as a narrow religious concept, adding: ``We are committed to secularism but are opposed to pseudo-secularism and appeasement for garnering minority votes.''''

Even while stating that there was no question of thrusting ``our agenda'''' of Ayodhya, Article 370 and a common civil code on any NDA partner, the BJP would make terrorism and Pota, the NCERT syllabus, dangers of infiltration, scrapping of the IMDT Act, need for anti-conversion laws, ban on cow slaughter, and population control into election issues.

13,SC notice to Bihar govt on ex-minister's plea,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday issued notice to the Bihar government on a petition by Rabri Devi''s former rural development minister Sanjay Singh, who is one of the accused in the killing of eight persons due to factional rivalry.

Singh, currently in jail, has raised a vital question of law that at the time of framing of charges, the court concerned ought to have considered his plea which is material to the trial.

Singh''s counsel R K Jain argued that a similar issue was recently referred to a larger five-judge Bench and his client''s plea that he was attending a meeting in a nearby village when the killings took place last year should have been looked into by the trial court.

Singh had also sought a CBI probe into the case as he felt that the state police was under pressure to arrest him.

Senior counsel Jain said that the trial court was fully empowered to summon any document or anything which was necessary or desirable for the purpose of any trial or other proceedings.

Referring to section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure which empowers the trial court to look into the material asked for by an accused, Jain said it would be in the interest of justice that before framing of the charges, the trial court should ask for the material which had been concealed by the prosecution.

If seen with a positive angle, the issue raised by Singh was of vital importance. Counsel said many cases of malicious prosecution and false criminal cases would be thrown out at the stage of framing of charges alone without making an innocent accused wait till the end of a lengthy trial running into years.

14,CISF jawan commits suicide,"MUMBAI: A young Central Industrial Security Force jawan stationed at the Mazagaon Docks shot himself with his service rifle on Friday evening.

The jawan, identified as Pavan Singh Rathi (31), shot himself while on duty in the watch tower overlooking the ship building yard.

The jawan was posted here from Kandla only a week ago, a dock worker told TNN. ""We do not know his name but he was apparently depressed for the last few days,"" the worker added.

CISF jawans are posted in all high-security zones run by the Central government such as airports, refineries, major ports and ship-building yards. Before joining the high-stress service, jawans have to undergo a psychological test.

On May 24, another over-stressed CISF jawan, Ramnarayan Namdeo (22), shot dead his superior and held six colleagues hostage at the international air terminal at Sahar.

15,Move to debar failed students from MSUSU polls,"VADODARA: It is failure in the final examinations that is haunting MSU student leaders who were eyeing key posts in the MSU Students'' Union (MSUSU) or various faculty associations. Four prominent student leaders supported by rival student outfits have not cleared the last examination.

What has sent alarming bells ringing, though, is that the university election committee has recommended those who took a readmission should not be allowed to contest polls. The committee was set up by the university to look into the rules governing the students'' union and association polls.

Usually leaders who failed took admission in other faculties or courses to contest polls. Indeed, a student leader had traversed six faculties in an attempt to stay in student politics and contest polls.

The university had earlier tried to curb this menace with a rule that students who had been on the campus for over six years could not contest the polls. However, it was found that several leaders did bother about studies and failed. Many of them changed faculties by way of a readmission and continued to contest the polls. Interestingly, some leaders who lost the polls did not even bother to pay the fees for the second term and in the next academic year took admission in a different faculty.

â€œThe new rule is an attempt to limit the trend of students remaining in the university only for the purpose of contesting polls. It had become very evident that for such leaders academics was secondary to student politicsâ€�, said a senior university functionary.

The move has, however, evoked sharp reactions from student leaders who are now alleging that the rule has been made to target leaders from a particular group.

â€œThose having a say in the administration want to ensure that me and other leaders from our group are not able to contest the polls. That is why the rule is being made with just about two months to go for the university electionsâ€�, said National Students'' Union of India (NSUI) leader and MSUSU general secretary Rutvij Joshi. Three student leaders from the NSUI â€” Joshi, Sai Dhekane and Lakhdhirsinh Jhala â€” have failed in the last examination. If they wish to contest polls this year, they will have to take a readmission in a different course, but this might not work if the new rule is implemented.

While Joshi has been alleging that the key functionaries in the university having leaning towards BJP and its sister organisations are behind the move, it will also affect candidates who have been supported by ABVP last year. Jignesh Rao, who was elected as the Faculty of Commerce general secretary last year with Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad''s (ABVP) support last year will also be affected by the same rule as he failed in TYBCom.

Another probable candidate from the same camp Jigar Bhatt is also in the dock as he was allegedly caught copying. A case regarding the incident is pending with the unfair means committee.

Commenting on the move, chairman of the election committee and MSU student dean Anil Navale said the issue was being discussed in the university for about an year now. â€œIt would be wrong to say that this has been brought keeping some leaders in mind. Besides, it is up to the syndicate to decide if the rule is to be implementedâ€�, Navale said.

16,Tariff hike opposed by ex-BJP minister,"GANDHINAGAR: Former BJP minister Narayanbhai Patel has opposed the steep increase in power tariff for the farm sector and urged Chief Minister Narendra Modi to review it in the larger interests of agriculturists of the state.

Patel told media persons here that he has apprised Modi of the adverse consequences of the decision which has sparked off protest wave among farming community.

â€œThe hike would add to hardships of the farmers who are already passing through crisis due to increase in the prices of agricultural inputs and the hike in power rates would add fuel to the fire,â€� he said.

Patel said as a legislator of ruling party, it was his duty to convey to Modi about the impact of the increase in the rates. Farmers in his Unjha constituency have already opposed the anti-farmer measure of the BJP government, he added.

17,Delhi govt to let all voters drink if Centre foots Bill,"NEW DELHI: Delhiâ€™s under-25s canâ€™t have alcohol. Thanks to the Punjab Excise Act, 1914, the cityâ€™s youth are neither allowed to buy liquor from shops nor go to restaurant-cum-bars and drink.

In other parts of the country, including Punjab, governments have amended the law.

In Maharashtra, the permissible age for drinking is 21. In Goa and UP and Karnataka itâ€™s 18. In Karnataka, 16-year-olds are allowed entry into pubs.

â€˜â€˜The problem with Delhi is its dual status. Land, excise and law and order come under the Centreâ€™s jurisdiction. This means the power to change the Punjab Excise Act, which controls the sale and supply of liquor, lies with the Union government,â€™â€™ Excise commissioner Debashree Mukherjee said on Friday.

She said the Delhi governmentâ€™s move to change the Act has been pending for about nine months now. â€˜â€˜A draft Act, which suggested that the permissible age for drinking be brought down has been prepared but there has not been any headway in the discussions with the Centre,â€™â€™ she said.

She said the home ministry has not agreed to repeal the Punjab Excise Act and allow an amendment in the Delhi Excise Act.

The Excise department is wary of going through an amendment in Parliament to change the law as it may take years.
