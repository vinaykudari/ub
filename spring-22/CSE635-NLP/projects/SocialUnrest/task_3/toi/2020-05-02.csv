0,No incubator in the Safdarjung Hospital burns ward,"NEW DELHI: The burns ward in Safdarjung Hospital hasnâ€™t had vital equipment such as rapid sterilisers for the last three years. The only incubator it has is not working.

The ward has a capacity of 156 beds and is said to be the largest in Asia. Even the Ram Manohar Lohia hospital is yet to install a ventilator in its burns department. The conditions remain the same even though the issue has come under the high courtâ€™s scrutiny. The doctors said the lack of basic equipment such as air curtains was contributing to the high infection rate in burns wards. â€˜â€˜Air curtains filter away the bacteria. Most deaths occur due to infection as the skin, which prevents micro organisms from entering the body, ceases to exist in a burn injury,â€™â€™ a doctor with the RML hospital said. While RML has just one air curtain, Safdarjung has two.

Similarly, standard air circulation and temperature monitoring systems are yet to be acquired. The action taken report of the Safdarjung hospitalmerely states that the matter has been taken up with the CPWD.

According to sources in Safdarjung, the burns wards have been functioning without rapid sterilisers since 1999. A burns specialist explained, â€˜â€˜It is very important for a burns ward to have its own sterilisers. In an emergency, it is not possible to run to the main hospital for sterilising instruments or even linen.â€™â€™ For a burns patient, proper sterilisation of bed sheets and other linen is imperative.

Even some of the overhead dressing lights attached to each ICU bed donâ€™t seem to be working. Last year, the department had procured 30 bulbs following a report published in this paper.

2,Is ASI inching towards truth?,"LUCKNOW: After sweating it out for about 45-odd days, the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) team, engaged in excavations at the disputed site in Ayodhya, has come up with some significant finds.

It has excavated a chamber near â€œRam chabootraâ€� and 11 foundation pillars and is now busy digging north and south of the â€œgarbha grihaâ€� (sanctum sanctorum) to study the pattern for technically concluding that some structure did exist there as revealed in the GPR survey.

In the April 28 progress report, submitted to the three-member special HC Bench, the ASI team leader BR Mani seems to have revealed more than what was tried to be concealed. The report makes mention of a â€œchamberâ€� near â€œRam chabootraâ€� â€” a place of importance â€” and 11 squarish or circular bases (pillars).

The two significant findings forced the ASI team to dig up a few new trenches north and south of the sanctum sanctorum, just 15 metres away from the deities installed at the makeshift temple, to study the pattern of the pillars found.

â€œThe results are encouraging and the ASI is now zeroing in on to establish that a structure did exist there before another was erected on it,â€� confided an independent archaeologist.

ASI had categorically mentioned in its April 28 progress report that a few pillars excavated were directly attached to the disputed structure (Babri mosque). â€œThe appearance so far of 11 squarish or circular structural bases having brickbats at the base with two rectangular blocks of calcrete stone over three or four courses of brickbats are significant as some of which are sealed directly by the original floor attached to the disputed structure,â€� pointed the report.

A report submitted to the VHP working president Ashok Singhal by an independent archaeologist too suggests that the ASI has succeeded in finding remnants of a structure.

â€œSo far the excavations have been done in accordance with the GPR survey and, as such, it is not surprising that the ASI has come across a structure beneath the disputed site,â€� Singhal disclosed in Ayodhya on Wednesday.

VHP general secretary Praveen Togadia exuded similar confidence. â€œI am a surgeon and I know better about sonography results. I knew it from the beginning what lies beneath,â€� chuckled Togadia in an informal chat with the Times News Network.

Experts feel that though it would be too early to jump to any conclusion, there remains no doubt that the excavations are now entering into a â€œconcluding phaseâ€� and the ASI has nearly unearthed the â€œtruthâ€� buried beneath the disputed site for centuries.

3,Suspended Samata leader launches new party,"PATNA: Suspended Samata Party leader P K Sinha today launched a new outfit - Loktantrik Samata Party - to counter the ""dictatorial practices"" of Samata leader and Railway Minister Nitish Kumar.

Announcing formation of the new party, Sinha, an MLC, claimed at a press conference here that the new party had whole-hearted support of former Bihar Samata President Raghunath Jha, MP, and another Lok Sabha member Brahmanand Mandal and two suspended MLAs Bhai Birendra and Ganesh Paswan, besides over a dozen district presidents and others.

All the MPs and MLAs opposed to Kumar would join the new party as soon as they muster the required numbers to split the Samata parliamentary and legislature parties, Sinha claimed.

Meanwhile, legislative council Chairman Jabir Hussain while accepting Sinha''s plea for making separate seating arrangements for him in the house also recognised him as a member of the new party. Sinha would be the lone member of his party in the upper house. The Samata Party earlier had three members in the legislative council.

Sinha said the new party would hold public meetings at Sheohar and Sitamarhi on May 17 and May 18 respectively where, he claimed, all the leaders and workers opposed to Kumar would participate.

Sinha said he would apply for registration of the new party with the Election Commission within the mandatory 30 days.

He said the main objective of the party would be to counter the ""dictatorial practice"" of Nitish Kumar and work for the welfare of the people of Bihar.

5,Govt's dithering on helmet rule confuses people,"HYDERABAD: Fixing of deadlines without understanding the complexity of the situation and the repeated postponement of the helmet rule and finally the government saying that it was keeping the orders in abeyance, has left the people confused.

""There is growing disenchantment over the whole issue,"" a senior government official said. The repeated postponement and the government''s latest decision to defer the implementation of helmet rule without announcing any date has also left officials confused.

Transport commissioner A Giridhar said, ""We have not got any information from government to stop implementing the helmet rule. So we will make people wear helmets as per the rules."" He, however, said that the Regional Transport Authority (RTA) is not fixing the deadlines for wearing helmets and it is the police who had done so.

The city requires more than 20 lakh helmets and one needs to tread cautiously while implementing the rule and people should be given enough time to purchase helmets, he added.

He said the RTA will not conduct raids or fine people for not wearing helmets. Meanwhile, there was confusion among people and at some helmet shops, the demand did not fall immediately.

""Who knows what the government will do tomorrow. It is better to buy a helmet than pay fines,"" A Madhusudan, a medical representative said on Friday. However, Mohammed Kareem, an employee of a helmet store in Abids said that they expect the demand to fall after a couple of days when the word finally spreads that the government will not enforce the helmet rule.

7,Pentagon readies rules for war crimes trials,"WASHINGTON: Legal instructions are ready for the trial of potential ""war criminals"" by US military commissions if President George W Bush decides to name individuals to be considered for prosecution, senior Pentagon officials have said.

""We are ready to go when the time is right,"" officials told reporters on Friday at the Pentagon, adding US has historically used military commissions to deal with ""violations"" of the laws of war.

The ''war criminals'' may include inmates of Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where several Taliban fighters are held.

For some time now, ""we have been reviewing different cases"" that might be suitable for prosecution by a military commission. While legal authorities have some thoughts about who would be appropriate to bring before a military commission, no final decisions have been made yet,"" the officials said.

On the number of individuals who might go before a commission, one of the officials said, ""we don''t have jurisdiction over anyone to try them until the president designates them as subject to his order.""

Officials expressed confidence that nearly 60 pages of instructions will provide for ""full and fair trials before military commissions.""

Asked whether these instructions would apply to Iraqis currently being detained, they said these were drawn up following an order by Bush that predated ""Operation Iraqi Freedom.""

But they clarified that if international terrorists were taken into custody in Iraq, ""it is possible that they could also be subject to this process.""

8,Maoists call for Jharkhand bandh on Monday,"RANCHI: In a virtual rejection of the recent talks offer made by Jharkhand Chief Minister Arjun Munda to Naxalites outfits, the Maoist Communist Centre and the People''s War have jointly called a bandh in six districts on May 5 in protest against alleged police atrocities.

Police quoting intelligence reports said these extremist organisations had jointly declared to enforce the bandh for 24 hours in Chaibasa, Simdega, Latehar, Garwah, Chatra and Palamau districts.

The police headquarters of the six districts and other Naxal-infested districts have been alerted in view of the bandh call, police said.

Over a month ago, the MCC sponsored two-day bandh in some districts witnessed property destruction by the extremists.

Meanwhile, an anti-landmine vehicle escaped a landmine blast triggered by suspected PW men near Baresanrih on Mahuadand-Garu road in Latehar district on Thursday night.

The blast created a crater on the spot, police said.

9,"Maya govt turns one, claims dip in crime rate","LUCKNOW: Completing one year in office on Saturday, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Mayawati claimed her government had been working relentlessly with thrust on law and order situation and development, and both have shown marked improvement.

""Crime graph in the state came down by 70 per cent since the BSP-BJP coalition came to power and action was taken against nine per cent of the accused which was a record of sorts,"" she told reporters.

Her government took harsh steps against notorious criminals despite political pressure and worked towards improving the financial position of the state, the chief minister said.

In the area of development, she said the state registered record revenue collection of Rs 12,575 crores in 2002, an increase of 22 per cent for the first time.

She listed setting up of state human rights commission, revival of sick units and development of Ambedkar villages as other achievements of her government.

Mayawati, under frequent attacks from all quarters for running the government in an ""arbitrary fashion"", said her coalition functioned smoothly with the cooperation of all partners.

Brushing aside criticism of her government by the opposition, Mayawati said it was reflective of their frustration.

""The opposition is a frustrated lot as it has not been able to hinder the smooth functioning of the coalition govenment which has completed one year in office today"", she told the reporters here.

The by-elections have proved the downward slide in the mass support of the opposition parties and they are worried about their political fortunes in the coming Lok Sabha elections, she said adding they were levelling baseless allegations against her government.

To a question, she said her government was firm in its resolve to deal corruption with an iron hand and all those found guilty would be punished.

The chief minister was also critical of the media which had misinterpreted her statement of inheriting the state with bad fiscal position and dismal law and order.

""The statement was not against Rajnath Singh whom I succeeded as the chief minister but on the state of affairs in the state since independence, but it was wrongly interpreted,"" she added.

On the problems being faced by the cane growers, Mayawat said she would be attending an important meeting in New Delhi on Monday on the issue.

10,BSP to go alone in Assembly polls: Mayawati,"NEW DELHI: Bhaujan Samaj Party would go it alone in the October Assembly elections in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chattisgarh and Delhi, party leader and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Mayawati said on Saturday.

""We will have no (no) alliance with BJP or any political party in the October Assembly elections in four states,"" Mayawati told reporters here in reply to a question.

Asked whether her party was having talks with any other political party for electoral alliance or understanding for the next year''s general elections, she said it was too early to say that.

Before the General elections, four states, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chattisgarh and Delhi would have Assembly polls, she said, adding ""we will chalk out our strategy only after the Assembly polls in October.""

11,Maya memsaab's govt turns one,"NEW DELHI: If the rigours and stresses of modern-day politics usually lead to premature aging at the least, Mayawati is the exception that proves the rule. Dressed in peach and in the pink of health, airily flaunting a huge security posse and throwing challenges in her wake, the UP chief minister celebrated another birthday on Saturday, this time at the Taj Mahal hotel here.

Third time lucky, it was a significant milestone â€“ the completion of one year as CM. On her last two outings in 1995 and 1997, Mayawati had been CM for four-and-a-half months and six months respectively. So there was reason to rejoice, and Mayawati did in style, as she is wont to do nowadays, crowing about the ""safe"" state that UP is today. To make her point she rolled out statistics that should keep her in the record books for the next few decades.

Crime, Mayawati claimed, had seen a 70 per cent drop in the state in her tenure. The economic situation, a priority for her government, had seen a spectacular improvement with revenue collection at Rs 12,545 crore, the best in the state since Independence. There had been no communal flare-up in all this while and she had put all known criminals small and big behind bars not yielding to political pressure. The last, a none-too-disguised and oft-repeated justification for putting away MLA and local strongman Raja Bhaiya on POTA charges.

And just in case anyone had forgotten, she threw in a few threats like: ""This is Mayawatiâ€™s government. Weâ€™ll do a hulla bol to anyone who tries a hulla bol on us."" In inimitable style, the Maya-isms were legion. Mulayam Singh Yadavâ€™s Samajwadi Party as her pet punching bag, Mayawati let loose: ""They said I was anti-Muslim. Then my Muslim candidate defeated an SP Muslim candidate. Then they said I was against Thakurs, my Thakur was better than theirs in the Gauriganj by-election.""

On VHP leader Parveen Togadia and an inevitable trishul distribution programme in UP soon, Mayawati brushed the whole suggestion away with: ""So heâ€™ll distribute a few trishuls, heâ€™s done it before. Why should I make a hero of him the way (Rajasthan CM) Gehlot did by stopping him?"" And on assertions of yore that now friend BJP was a ""Manuvadi (casteist)"" party, the unfazed BSP leader explained: ""Itâ€™s all about the company you keep. The BJP is a changed party, in UP at least.""

It was her day, and she had an answer for everything. Grilled about the poor power situation in the state, Mayawati said the opposition was trying to sully her image. When pointed out that the power issue was being raised by the people not politicians, she reasoned: ""All janta (the people) are not sarkar-minded. Some are opposition-minded.""

Largely soft on partner BJP and realising without its support she would not be marking a year in power, Mayawati refrained from making one of her usual acerbic comments about her ally, but was unequivical in her assertion that the BSP ""will fight the (November) Assembly elections in four states alone. No alliances"".

The woman who heads a mammoth cabinet said her party would support a Bill to limit the size of ministries and also one to make defections impossible. Only a few months ago a chunk of Congress leaders split from the parent party to join hands with the coalition government in UP. Days before that Mayawati had claimed she could split the small Congress unit anytime.

So will the leopard change its spots? Not likely. The stock reaction to any criticism remains the same: Everyone grudges ""efforts to bolster the self-confidence of the downtrodden"".

""We (pilots) arrived at a ''consensus'' decision at a meeting to sign the undertaking under protest,"" an IPG spokesman said adding some key office-bearers and pilots, who are out of station, are yet to comply with the directions of the management.

A-I''s public relations director Jitender Bhargava said ""we have now undertakings from more than 185 pilots, including 35, who have signed earlier, enabling us to revise our flight schedule and operate additional services to the Gulf and restore the Chennai-Singapore flights from tomorrow.""

He said two sets of undertaking, one for the suspended pilots and the other for the striking pilots, were given. They have since signed it, agreeing to ""maintain proper discipline and carry out assignments and duties entrusted from time to time"".

The pilots will also now have to adhere to increased flying and duty time limitations (FDTL) as prescribed by the regulatory body, which would be ten hours as against nine hours earlier and 14 hours as against 12, Bhargava said.

For the suspended pilots, an additional clause has been added in the undertaking stating ""I admit that I refused to undertake the flight when rostered by the company because of the directives issued by the union"".

He termed as ''unfortunate'' the violent incidents at Marad yesterday and said it had brought shame to the state, known for its high literacy. The government would take effective steps to control the situation, he added.
