0,Even govt says TOI is Delhi's No. 1,"NEW DELHI: After being voted No. 1 by readers in Delhi in the last two Indian Readership Surveys, The Times of India has now been rated as the cityâ€™s top newspaper by the Directorate of Advertising and Visual Publicity (DAVP) of the government.

The Times of India prints the highest number of copies among all newspapers printed in Delhi, declares the DAVP. It leads the Hindustan Times by a print run of 23,469 copies.

The DAVP made the declaration in its recently issued circular on the advertising rates it has fixed for various newspapers, based on the number of copies they print in Delhi. In the circular, the TOI has been assigned the highest ad rate of all newspapers in the city.

The government data backs the findings of the Indian Readership Survey (IRS-2002), which in its top-line findings for the New Delhi market has noted that TOI is the highest read English newspaper in the Capital. IRS, widely acknowledged as the most dependable study on media penetration, has noted in its 2002 survey that almost 60 per cent of English daily newspaper readers in New Delhi can be reached through the TOI alone.

The Times of Indiaâ€™s growth has been possible due to the tremendous support it has received from the market. Drawn by a combination of an all-colour product and up-scaled content, a surge of new readers have begun subscribing to the paper in the last four months. The advertising world has also responded with great enthusiasm, and ad revenues in the newspaper are growing at a very healthy rate over last year.

We take this opportunity to thank our readers, advertisers and now, the Government.

1,Panel proposes changes in building bye-laws,"MOHALI: The Punjab Urban Building Byelaws Review Committee has recommended several sweeping changes in the building byelaws applicable to the houses in the state.

If accepted and incorporated in the byelaws, several need-based alterations people have made in the houses in the various schemes of Punjab Urban Planning and Development Authority (PUDA) could be regularised.

The review committee, at its meeting held some time back, discussed the byelaws concerning cantilever constructions undertaken by residents, internal renovations or the need-based extensions made to accommodate the increase in size of families.

A large of house owners have been given notices by PUDA because they have undertaken these activities which are not permitted under present byelaws.

Members of the committee representing the plot owners told Times News Network that it was the general opinion of the committee members, who included PUDA officials and other noted engineers and architects, that these so called violations should be regularised if they have been done inside the boundary of the plot and there is no gross violation of rules.

The committee also discussed another important building activity for which PUDA has issued notices to several house owners in Mohali and other cities. This is staircases in houses, which are not provided for in the original building plans of PUDA.

On this matter too, the committee members were of the view that unless rules have been grossly violated, the violations should be regularised.

A byelaw review committee, comprising PUDA officials, well-known architects and civil engineers, had been formed to look into the building byelaws which have being severely criticised for being too archaic and rigid.

2,US expert wants change in policy,"KOLKATA: Experts from the USA attending a seminar on the future of IR freight carsâ€™ in Kolkata on Thursday painted a grim picture of the future of the Indian Railways, if development of the road transport system continued unabated.

Once the golden quadrilateral, northsouth and east-west corridors were completed by 2007, road transport would account for 70 per cent of freight, they said.

Currently, the railwaysâ€™ share of freight is around 38 per cent. Even Eastern Railway general manager S C Sengupta admitted that the railways system would not survive if the share was not increased to at least 50 per cent. â€œWith the completion of the road network, the Indian economy can absorb at least 36,000 large trucks per year.

The economy can support 300,000 such trucks by that time. If the average new truck capacity is 25 tonnes, then by 2014, IR will no longer be seeing an annual gain in traffic. If 60 tonne is allowed and becomes universal, by 2009, the railways will be losing traffic at the rate of 6.5 per cent every year,â€� said David Burns, railroad industrial engineering consultant. They felt that IR would have to change its strategy and open its tracks to private shippers. â€œA shipper can own rolling stock (wagons and locomotives) and have contracts with the IR for train crew and other support. An important precedent has been set with CONCOR, which owns the rolling stock and enters into contracts with the railways for crew and locomotives,â€� Burns said.

The experts also felt that wagon designs in India needed to be overhauled. Wagons and freight cars with larger capacity and better facilities needed to be constructed, they felt. There were also possibilities of constructing double-decker wagons for movement of cars.

Wagon manufacturers in India, however, felt that it was wishful thinking on the part of the US experts to talk about new wagon designs.

3,HC tells govt. to file affidavit on Mula Pravara Cinema,"PUNE: The Nagpur bench of the Bombay high court (HC) has directed the state government to file an affidavit by June 25 explaining what it intended to do to recover electricity bill arrears worth Rs 382 crore from the Mula Pravara electric co-operative society.

The society has licence to supply power in Ahmednagar district. The order was passed recently in response to a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Pune-based Akhil Bharatiya Grahak Panchayat (ABGP), seeking directives for solving the problems of load shedding and recovery of power bill arrears from high-tension consumers.

The bench had on July 26, 2002, directed the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) to disconnect power supply to the society for default in payment. The government and the MSEB appealed against the HC order in the supreme court in March this year, but the apex court confirmed the Nagpur benchâ€™s decision and reverted the matter to it.

The Nagpur bench, comprising justices J.N. Patel and S.G. Mahajan, wondered why the society was being favoured despite it defaulting on payment and causing huge losses to the MSEB. It observed that the government should have revoked the societyâ€™s licence, but, instead, it continued to give huge subsidies to it.

The court observed that the government either revoke the societyâ€™s licence and hand over the society to the MSEB or liquidate it as per the provisions of the Maharashtra co-operative societies Act 1960.

As a third option, the court suggested that the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission should be told to examine whether the society should be allowed to continue or not.

â€œIf the government is not prepared to exercise any of the options, it will have to pay the societyâ€™s electricity bills,â€� the court warned, adding that if the issues were not settled by June 25, it will dispose of the PIL.

The court has told the MSEB to continue electricity supply to the society till June 30. It, however, clarified that if the society has bill arrears on that day, the MSEB will be free to disconnect its power supply.

ABGP secretary Bhimsen Khedkar welcomed the high court directive and hoped that the government would settle the issue once and for all. He pointed out that the MSEBâ€™s bill arrears had mounted to a staggering Rs 8,000 crore and that the board had every right to recover them.

4,DPWS members threaten to commit mass suicide,"AMRITSAR: Members of Danga Peerrat Welfare Society (DPWS), Punjab, on Thursday, threatened to commit mass suicide before the residence of chief minister Amarinder Singh at Chandigarh on June 3, if the state government did not implement the decisions taken by the erstwhile Parkash Singh Badal''s government for their rehabilitation.

A delegation of the society comprising its president Surjit Singh, president of its ladies wing Gurdeep Kaur, senior vice-president Gurdeep Singh Ghai, vice-president Harcharan Singh Channi met Akal Takht jathedar Joginder Singh Vedanti on Thursday and urged him to denounce the present state government for being unable to rehabilitate the victims of 1984 anti-Sikh riots.

They also urged Vedanti to appeal to all Sikh organisations to come forward for the help of the victims who were awaiting justice for the last 18 years.Vedanti, however, rejected their appeal and told them to drop their threat of committing mass suicides as it was against Sikh principles.

Gurdeep Kaur, while talking to mediapersons, said thousands of victims would reach Amritsar and march for Chandigarh in form of ''Shaheedee Jatha'' after performing prayers at Golden Temple on June 2.

She said that Vedanti had guided them on religious grounds and if the government did not help them, they were left with no option than to take the extreme step.

She said the society would also disclose the names of persons responsible for the 1984 carnage at Chandigarh. The vice-president of the society said that about 30,000 families had settled in Punjab after the 1984 riots.

The Badal government had taken some decisions for the rehabilitation of these families which included allotment of 3,600 houses in Punjab, 327 commercial booths at Ludhiana and 200 at Mohali and Patiala. The Badal government had also promised to allot residential plots and commercial booths in Amritsar, Jalandhar, Phagwara and Bathinda, he added.

He alleged that the Congress government on April 15 had given an advertisement for the sale of 1,352 houses in Ludhiana which were reserved for riot victims.

5,Lack of political will allows poachers to get away,"KOLKATA: Lack of political will and weak anti-poaching legislation are among the biggest challenges facing Indian wildlife conservationists.

Raja Chattarjee, secretary of advocacy-cum-activist NGO, â€˜The Jungleesâ€™ told TNN on Thursday that the politician-jungle mafia nexus was a proving to be a thorn in the efforts of conservationists. â€œMinisters in Orissa and Andhra Pradesh have treated their marriage guests with deer meat. Only in stray instances do such crimes come to light. Film stars Salman Khan, Saif Ali Khan and Sonali B e n d r e were charged for shooting black buck. There are many other celebrities who act mindlessly,â€� Chatterjee said.

While poaching often occurs with tacit support of a few corrupt jungle administrators who enjoy the patronage of politicians, state principal chief conservator of forests Atanu Raha reminded there were honest forest guards working relentless who needed some legislative support to boost their morale.

â€œMany a times, forest guards put their life at risk to apprehend poachers. But it is very discouraging when the culprits are granted bail at the slightest pretext,â€� he said. Politicians are reportedly attempting to release dreaded poacher Sansar Chand from Tihar Jail. Wildlife conservators are now calling for more stringent monitoring of foreign funds flowing into the sector. Wildlife conservation efforts attract the secondhighest amount of foreign aid after AIDS with an estimated Rs 100 crore flowing in every year.

Tiger conservation alone attracts nearly half the amount.

â€œAll international and national agencies that sponsor wildlife projects should act as watchdogs to ensure that the money is used properly,â€� Chatterjee said, admitting that despite efforts, poaching continues to thrive.

Once in a while though, there are cases that offer a ray of hope in the wilderness. The Periyar Tiger Reserve, for instance, where a group of 26 poachers were apprehended and then offered a chance to integrate into the mainstream. Today, all of them are ecotourist guides at the forest.

7,Puri seer blames it on vote politics,"PATNA: The Puri Shankaracharya, Swami Sri Nischalanand Saraswatiji Maharaj, here on Thursday said that the ""vote bank politics"" of the country is the main reason for the delay in finding a solution to the Ayodhya issue.

The Shankaracharya said that the interference of the Supreme Court in the issue has only complicated the matter further. He said that earlier the dispute was between only two communities, but now after the interference of the SC the Buddhists and Jains have also started claiming the disputed land by citing historical evidence.

He said, ""why do they forget the fact that the structure of the building clearly reveals that of a temple with the ""gumbaj"" and not ""minar"" or any structure related to other religions than Hinduism.""

The Shankaracharya said that the Ayodhay issue has been at the centre stage of India''s politics from time immemorial, but no one has ever tried to find an amicable solution to the problem. He said that the present government should follow the footsteps of Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel who by dint of his ability settled the issue related to Somnath.

Answering a question he said that all political parties, including the Congress, want a Ram temple to be built at Ayodhya. The activities from the time of Rajiv Gandhi are a clear indicator of their attitude, but just to get the minority vote the party keeps evading the issue, he added.

He said that everyone knows that in India Parliament has the power to pass any law of the land which is in the interest of the society. If the politicians really want to settle the Ram mandir dispute the Congress should have brought a Bill in Parliament for building the temple, he said. ""Once this type of resolution is brought by the Congress the BJP, Shiv Sena and other parties will support it and the problem will be automatically solved,"" he added.

He said the politicians should always remember that the interest of the majority community cannot be set aside just for the sake of pleasing the minorities.

Speaking on the role the religious leaders can play in the development of the country, Swamiji said that the Indian government want Shankaracharyas to be dummies or those who advocate their policies. World institutions, including World Bank and International Monetary Fund, seek advise from us on policy matters, but we are not consulted by our own government, he said.

The Shankaracharya said, ""agar hamare bataye raste par bahrat chale to saat mahine mein America natmastak ho ajyega.""

11,Kanpur farmers threaten suicide,"KANPUR: Caught in a cycle of debt and crop failures, hundreds of farmers in and around Kanpur have threatened to commit suicide. The farmers, who face burgeoning loans, are being chased by tehsil revenue collection teams to pay up. Defaulters are being carried off to jail.

About 60 farmers, who have defaulted on loans taken to purchase seed, fertilisers and other farm equipment, have already landed in different tehsil jails, including at Rasoolabad, Hjatampur, Billhuar, Kanpur and Bhognipur.

Hundreds others have gone underground, spending sleepless nights away from their homes to avoid arrests.

Raju, a farmer from Khatharua village who is in Kanpur tehsil jail, told Times News Network he had taken a loan of Rs 4,500 to buy a buffalo. ""I incurred huge loss due to the drought last year... how can I repay my loan when we don''t even get the production cost of our crops?"" he laments.

He said the government should find a solution instead of ""throwing"" farmers behind bars. Katiyar said: ""Shivrajpur lies in the potato belt. The farmers here are incurring huge losses due to low returns on their produce this year. How can you expect them to repay their dues under such circumstances?""

But district magistrate Arvind Kumar said: ""The government had stayed recovery of dues from the farmers only till March this year. Now the administration is free to recover it. Crop growers were given a deadline which has lapsed.""

Meanwhile, Pepsico said in a release it started the unit after a due survey by the department concerned on availability of water and denied the panchayat charge that the company was over-exploiting water resources in the area.

Mishra, who briefed Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee in Manali on his recent talks in Washington with President George W Bush, his American counterpart Condoleezza Rice and other leaders, denied there was any pressure on India from the US. ""When they come to us and say exercise restraint, we tell them to go and talk to Pakistan,"" Mishra said. Question : And, they never talk down to us? Mishra : ""No, never"". The Pakistan minister contended that there can be no solution to the Kashmir problem unless aspirations of the people of Kashmir are taken into consideration. ""Even if we show flexibility,"" he said, ""flexibility will extend only so far and we will have to tackle the aspirations of the people of Kashmir."" The Palestine and Kashmir problems are left over from the colonial era, he said. ""One way is to shut our eyes and hope it will go away. The other is to try and meet the situation.""

24,Kerala govt to provide legal protecton to Pepsi,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Kerala Chief Minister A K Antony on Friday said state government would provide all possible legal protection to the Pepsi company at Kanjikode in Palakkad district whose license had been cancelled by the local panchayat controlled by CPI-M.

""The decision of the Pudussery village Panchayat to revoke the licence has not been received by the government,"" Antony said at a ''meet-the-chief minister programme'', organised by the Thiruvananthapuram press club here.

Lashing out at the CPI-M for continuing its stir of boycotting multinational products in the state, Antony said the party should shed its ""double standards"" on the issue and should be ""more truthful in its approach.""

The Pepsi company came to the state during LDF regime and now they were opposing the company. ""However, we are not going to do anything to push them away from the state,"" he said.

In West Bengal, there were three Pepsi units and two coca-cola units. CPI-M was boycotting the products of these companies in the state while allowing the companies in West Bengal, he said, adding CPI-M''s ""attitude was against the development of the state.""

The main reason cited for cancellation of licence was ""over exploitation of water resources."" The Panchayat decision also forms part of CPI-M''s policy of boycotting the products of multinationals in the wake of US war on Iraq.

Meanwhile, Pepsico said in a release it started the unit after due survey by the department concerned on availability of water and denied the panchayat charge that the company was over-exploiting water resources in the area.

25,US steel industry protests rampant Indian exports,"

NEW YORK: Upset over India not fulfilling its commitment to check its surging stainless steel exports, the US steel industry has asked the administration to take protective measures including hike in import duty.

â€˜â€˜It is time for action... India is wrecking havoc in the US market,â€™â€™ said Paul Kelly, chairman of Speciality Steel Industry of North American and president and CEO of Slater Steel Inc, in a letter to US President George W Bush.

At present Indian stainless steel is exempt from US steel import relief programme which allows the government to take protective measures, including increasing import duty and tariff rate quota.

The Indian government and its steel producers, the letter added, have not lived up to their commitments that the surge would end beginning of January.

This commitment was made by the Indian government representative to US state delegate Robert Zoellick during consulations late last year.

Imports of stainless steel products in January and February, 2003, were triple the monthly average in 2001, and about 37 per cent greater than 2002, a year in which imports surged dramatically.

â€˜â€˜Imports of stainless steel angles alone were up by 635 per cent over the 2001 monthly average. Ninety-nine per cent of all stainless steel angle imports in February were from India. Commerce department data shows requests for import licenses from Indian producers remained at extraordinarily high levels,â€™â€™ the letter added.PTI
