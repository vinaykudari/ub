0,Remove all controversial hoardings: EC tells Modi govt,"GANDHINAGAR: The Election Commission has directed the Gujarat government to ensure the removal of all hoardings in the state which have the potential for inciting communal passions. Hoardings put up at government cost describing Narendra Modi as the â€œbest CMâ€� will also have to be pulled down.

In an order sent directly to state chief secretary G Subba Rao, the EC has said that these hoardings violate sections 135 A, 135 B, 505 (2) of the IPC and section 125 of the Representative of Peopleâ€™s Act.

The EC order insisted upon the chief secretary to ask the state police department to take necessary action â€œimmediatelyâ€� and also start legal proceedings against all those responsible for putting up the hoardings.

â€œPutting up such hoardings is a criminal offence as they ignite communal feelings among people in poll mode,â€� said a senior bureaucrat, revealing details of the EC order.

In yet another order, the EC has asked the Gujarat government to desist from using electronic and print media for propaganda, highlighting the governmentâ€™s achievements. Pointing out that this violates the model code of conduct, the EC order has also sought the removal of those hoardings that project the governmentâ€™s achievements.

â€œThis means that nearly 350 hoardings, put up all over the state with government money, projecting Chief Minister Modi as the best CM will have to be removed immediately,â€� said the bureaucrat.

â€œSimultaneously, the Diwali cards, printed in a government press, highlighting the achievements of the Modi administration will have to be withdrawn forthwith.â€� The chief secretary would have to send a compliance report on this too.

The two EC orders, sources said, are based on media reports on the hoardings about the burning of the Sabarmati Express and advertisements in some newspapers inciting communal passion against a particular community.

â€œThe EC seems to feel that the party in power is using its position to further its political ends,â€� said sources close to the chief secretary.

The order has created panic in the Chief Ministerâ€™s Office, with principal secretary to the CM, P K Mishra, meeting the chief secretary to find out how to resolve the tangled issue. Despite the EC order, both the chief secretaryâ€™s office and the CMO have chosen to remain silent on the issue. A top official close to the CM, however, said, â€œWe have received no order from the EC.â€�

2,"No threat to govt, says Bhujbal","MUMBAI: Reacting to the Supreme court ruling, staying Mumbai High Court order upholding disqualification of seven MLA''s of the Maharashtra assembly, Deputy Chief Minister Chhagan Bhujbal on Saturday said the DF government was stable and there was no threat to it.

""There is nothing to worry"", Bhujbal, told mediapersons when his attention was drawn to the apex court order.

Referring to the order, Bhujbal, a senior NCP leader, said ""the court has given interim relief in similar cases in the past"".

Mumbai High Court had upheld Speaker Arun Gujarathi''s decision to disqualify seven MLAs, including five from NCP, who had written letters to the Governor withdrawing support to the Congress-NCP coalition government earlier this year.

The MLAs, five from NCP, one from JD(S) and the nominated one, could attend the Assembly proceedings but would not be entitled to vote or participate in the debates, the Bench said.

3,Police protest against ASI’s arrest on Sunday,"MUZAFFARPUR: Muzaffarpur district police force will observe a ""protest day"" on Sunday to express their resentment against the arrest of Maniari police station ASI Braj Mohan Singh in connection with police firing leading to the death of two persons including a mukhiya. They described the arrest as ""illegal"".

Policemen and officers have put up banners at the gates of their respective police stations to inform people about their protest day.Explaining the situation, a senior police inspector said on Saturday that the mukhiya of Raghunathpur Madhuban panchayat Sanjeev Kumar Sharma was a declared offender for the last 6 years.

He had escaped from jail twice and he was inside the jail even when he was elected as mukhiya. According to the inspector, the mukhiya had entered the Maniyari police station premises to kill the ASI on the basis of a rumour of misbehaviour with village women when he was shot dead by police in self-defence.

Although, the final decision on the form of agitation would be taken only on Sunday following the announcement by stateâ€™s general secretary of BPA, police officers seem to be unanimous to refuse their superiorsâ€™ order to arrest any person in absence of any designated magistrate as a case of murder was instituted against ASI only because he had opened fire without an order from a magistrate.

The ASI is presently behind the bars and admitted to local S K Medical College Hospital following complaints of pain in his heart after being arrested on his surrender before the court.

Meanwhile, the Peopleâ€™s Unity for Civil LIberty (PUCL) has found the ASI responsible for the murder of mukhiya Sharma and a villager Mahesh Mahto following a probe into the October 17 police firing at Maniyari police station. The firing was totally unjustified and barbarous, the PUCL has described. As the police administration is trying to defend the ASI, it would be better if a CBI inquiry is ordered in the case to expose the guilty responsible for the police firing, stressed PUCL.

4,Panchkula govt schools courting poor results?,"PANCHKULA: A pass percentage of 40.06 per cent in class 10 examinations in government schools in Panchkula district this year should have made the authorities sit up, but nothing has even been done to even fill up the 25 per cent of posts of teachers lying vacant.Even though the rationalisation process is over, the education department is yet to provide teachers for Social Sciences and English, which comprise the major chunk of the vacant posts. If this were not enough, it is the expertise of the physical training instructors which is keeping some primary schools afloat. Then, many of the schools are head-less. The senior secondary schools at Toda, Hangola and Tikkar Hill, and the high schools at Mallah, Barh Godaam, Bhurhi, Khetprali, Thandog, Paploha, Marhanwala, Parwala have no principals. In 48 high schools, there are just 251 teachers for the 2,500 students. The situation is worse in middle schools: just 132 teachers for 40 schools. In many middle schools, there are none. Students of schools in Baldwala, Thandog, Kotii and Bhuri have to make do with those borrowed from other schools. District education officer Phool Khatri said: ""We have been taking up the matter with the director (higher education). Even the deputy commissioner has sent missives to the department."" The heads of senior secondary schools in Hangola, Toda and Tikkar Hill would be appointed within a fortnight, she added. But, she was tightlipped on the appointment of teachers.

6,Independents can spoil Mufti's party,"SRINAGAR: A dozen-odd Independents, who had earlier pledged to support Congress-People''s Democratic Party (PDP) coalition maintained a stiff upper lip on Saturday as Mufti Mohammed Sayeed was sworn in as the sixth chief minister of the state.

The dozen Independents are divided in two groups, of which one is seven-member strong and includes two CPM legislators.

The other group comprises five Independents from Jammu region, including Manohar Lal Sharma (Billawar), Abdul Majid Wani (Doda), Aijaz (Gool-Arnas), Moulvi Rashid (Banihal) and Puran Singh (Darhal).

Behind-the-scenes negotiations continued all through Friday as all Independents insisted on being given ministries as had been promised to them by the Congress 20 days ago.

However, senior Congress leader Ambika Soni ruled this out saying they could be inducted into the ministry only on a rotational basis and not in one go.

At one time, the Congress leaders tried to convince M Y Tarigami, who leads a pack of seven, that one of them could be sworn in along with Mufti. She also reportedly told the same thing to the other five that one of them could be sworn in on Saturday.

The Independents rejected this offer outright and insisted that they all wanted to be told then and there what the Congress-PDP coalition had on its platter for them.

Since the elections to four Rajya Sabha seats from the state are due in the near future, the Congress-PDP coalition can ill-afford to antagonise the Independents as each vote is crucial if it wants to ensure the victory of three candidates.

One seat anyway would be bagged by Farooq Abdullah on the strength of the 28 National Conference legislators.

To bring further pressure on Mufti and state Congress chief Ghulam Nabi Azad, the Independents are now insisting that they be given one Rajya Sabha seat. Not only this, they have also sought one-third share in the nomination of MLCs whose names have to be proposed by the government.

The gameplan of the PDP-Congress coalition managers was to draw a wedge among the Independents, offer ministries to some of them and then keep the carrot of office dangling before them for some more time.

In fact, senior Congress members admitted in private that they want to form the complete ministry only after two crucial tests: the Rajya Sabha elections and the vote of confidence in the state Assembly.

The Independents have now decided to stick it together and not concede any ground to the coalition leaders. To keep the negotiations going, the Independents maintained on Saturday publicly that they would support the coalition government from outside.

In the behind-the-door lobbying, they kept on demanding ministries and even indulged in a bit of sabre-rattling (threatening not to support the government on the floor of the House).

Asked for his comments, one Independent, requesting anonymity, said tongue firmly in cheek ""The Congress has surrendered the CMs post and will wait for three years to have its CM. It should ask its MLAs to wait for three years to become ministers and make us (Independents) ministers now. That way we would not claim any ministerships in 2005 when a Congress CM takes charge"".

Asked whether they were ready to play the dirty dozen if not given ministries in the near future, one of them said: ""You bet.""

Usman Majid, an Independent not affiliated to any group, said: ""The mathematics of the House is such that I am the 44th member for either side. The Congress (20), PDP (16), Panthers Party (4) and three members from Ladakh add up to 43.""

All others put together comprise 43 since the NC has 28, the two groups of Independents 12 and the BJP, BSP and the Jammu State Morcha have one member each. The way the numbers game was poised now, it would not be easy for the PDP-Congress combine to deny the Independents their due, he pointed out, adding he definitely would not go along with the government in a crisis situation.

7,"Mufti, a smart survivor in maze of politics","SRINAGAR: The new Jammu and Kashmir chief minister, Mufti Mohammed Sayeed, is a smart survivor in the maze of politics. A man blamed for rise in militancy in the state, 67-year-old Mufti has switched political loyalties many a time.

But for the most of his career, he is known to be a baiter of three generations of the Abdullah dynasty. It was during his tenure as the Union home minister in the V P Singh government from December 1989 to November 1990 that militancy heightened in J&K.

When his daughter Rubayya was kidnapped by militants, he had allowed the release of some militants in lieu of her release. He drew a lot of flak for this action.

Notwithstanding the criticisms, Mufti still believes talks with militants could help in ending violence in the state. Born on January 12, 1936, in Brijbehara in Anantnag district, he studied at S P College in Srinagar and went to Aligarh to pursue his master''s and law.

Mufti was member of the state legislative assembly from 1962 to 1972, followed by five years as member of the legislative council.

He was deputy minister of agriculture and cooperation and minister of works and urban development. He came close to becoming the chief minister in 1976 when the Congress withdrew its support to the government led by Shiekh Mohammad Abdullah, the NC founder.

A long time critic of the National Conference, he has a running feud with Farooq Abdullah, who blames him for the dismissal of his governments in 1984 and 1990. Mufti had crossed over to the Janata Dal in 1987 and became a Union minister. He was elected to the Rajya Sabha in 1986 and again, in 1992, but resigned in 1996.

After a long political hibernation, he returned to active politics after the 1998 Lok Sabha elections. He revived the Congress in the valley and won the Anantnag Lok Sabha seat. PTI

8,RSS on disinvestment,"INDORE: The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) has expressed its disagreement with the Centre over the disinvestment of big public sector units.

Sangh spokesperson M S Vaidya told media here on Saturday that though in principal the RSS was not opposed to Centre''s disinvestment policy, it has identified some strategic sectors like oil, defence, nuclear, railways where it was opposed to the Centre.

He said the RSS has already informed the government about its dissension over disinvestment of some strategic sectors. ""Now it was up to the government to take a final decision in this regard,"" he added.

Vaidya said that the RSS was mainly concerned about three major issues security (internal and external), breaking up of the society and religious conversions.

Supporting the Centre''s stand on terrorism, he said India was facing two types of terrorism â€” leftist and Islamic. Of the two, the Islamic terrorism was dangerous.

He said unless social awareness is created, terrorism cannot be wiped out from the country.

9,'Law and order not ground for postponement of polls',"NEW DELHI: Apparently keeping in mind the premise on which the Election Commission had postponed polls in Gujarat, a constitution bench of the Supreme Court has ruled that law and order should ordinarily not be a ground for deferring elections.

Giving exclusive jurisdiction to the Election Commission to conduct polls and fix its schedule, a five-judge constitution bench comprising Chief Justice B N Kirpal, Justice V N Khare, Justice K G Balakrishnan, Justice Ashok Bhan and Justice Arijit Pasayat unanimously held on October 28 that ""ordinarily, law and order or public disorder should not be occasion for postponing the elections....""

The Election Commission in its 40-page order on August 16 had deferred holding of polls in Gujarat to November-December on grounds that the electoral rolls in the state were defective and that the law and order situation was not normal.

The EC in its order had said ""the law and order situation cannot be said to have become normal as fear in the minds of large sections of the electorate, particularly of the minority community, is still a palpable reality and the riot victims would be extremely wary of going to the polling stations to cast their votes fearing risk to their life and property"".

Justice Pasayat and Justice Balakrishnan, who wrote separate but concurring judgements, also indicated that law and order situations engineered by certain persons should be sternly dealt with and ""should not normally be a ground for deferring elections...."".

The Supreme Court also rejected the stand of the Election Commission that ""Article 174 of the constitution must yield to Article 324 in the interest of genuine democracy and purity of elections.""

While Article 174 mandated that six months should not lapse between two sittings of a House, Article 324 gave exclusive jurisdiction to the Commission to superintend, direct and control the polls.

While holding that ""elections should be held within six months for constituting Legislative Assembly from the date of dissolution of the Legislative Assembly"", the court said, ""Article 174(1) and Article 324 operate on different fields and neither Article 174(1) is subject to Article 324 nor Article 324 is subject to Article 174(1) of the constitution.""

Expressing inability to hold elections in accordance with the mandate of Article 174(1), the Commission had stated in its order that ""the non-observance of the provisions of Article 174(1) in the aforesaid eventuality would mean that the government of the state cannot be carried on in accordance with the provisions of the constitution within the meaning of Article 356(1) of the Constitution and the President should step in"".

The constitution bench said, ""It appears that the gratuitous advice of Article 356 by the Election Commission in its order was in all sincerity, although now in our interpretation of Article 174(1), we find that it was misplaced.""

10,SP seeks Thackeray's arrest,"MUMBAI: Demanding immediate arrest of Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray for his alleged provocative speeches, the Samajwadi Party on Sunday blamed the DF government for adopting double standards by failing to meet its promise of implementing findings of the Srikrishna Commission of inquiry into the communal riots of 1992-93.

Merely registering cases against Thackeray under section 153 A IPC would not suffice and the state government should immediately arrest him for allegedly delivering provocative speeches, Samajwadi Party''s Maharashtra unit president Abu Asim Azmi said here.

In the past, cases were registered against Thackeray but they were withdrawn by the BJP-Sena government. Referring to a recent case filed against the Sena chief for openly demanding formation of suicide squads by Hindus to counter terrorist designs, Azmi said this one would also be withdrawn like the others.

What is the use of filing cases when no action was taken against Thackeray?, Azmi asked accusing the Deputy Chief Minister Chhagan Bhujbal of adopting double standards in this regard.

Referring to Bhujbal''s comment of not taking action against Thackeray because it could lead to law and order problem, the SP chief said, ""If the government is scared of Thackeray, it should resign on moral grounds"".

11,SP leaders protest arrest of dissident MLAs,"LUCKNOW: Samajwadi Party leaders led by state general secretary Shivpal Singh Yadav met Governor Vishnu Kant Shastri and told him that the arrests of dissident independent MLAs Raghuraj Pratap Singh alias Raja Bhaiya and Dhananjay Singh on Sunday were ""politically motivated"".

""We told the the Governor that the arrests of the two independent MLAs were politically motivated and the charges against them were cooked up"", party legislative council leader Ahmad Hasan said.

He alleged that the case against the two independent legislators was registered under pressure.

Several SP legislators led by Yadav also staged a demonstration in front of Senior Superintendent of Police Anil Agarwal''s residence and demanded immediate release of the two MLAs.

Some of them later met him and lodged their protest.

Yadav said the administration was persecuting the rebels at the instance of the state government.

The two dissident legislators were arrested on charges of threatening BJP MLA Puran Singh Bundela who has left the dissident camp and reaffirmed his faith in party''s state leadership.

14,Rs 5-cr govt grant for Transport Corporation,"AHMEDABAD: In the wake of a Rs 5 crore grant, sanctioned by the state government earlier this week, Diwali will turn out to be a joyous affair after all for the passengers and staff of the Gujarat State Road Transport Corporation (GSRTC).

While a portion of the fund has been used to pay Diwali bonus and other outstanding arrears to the employees of the GSRTC, a sizeable chunk has been utilised to purchase tyres and spare parts for hundreds of defunct buses lying in the division sheds.

According to officials, till last week, nearly 1,100 buses were taken off the road due to lack of spare parts and tyres, depleting the fleet strength of the corporation substantially. The situation resulted in a tough time for commuters of the rural areas, whose only mode of transportation are the state-run bus.

With the traffic density swelling around the festival time, the corporation usually has to deploy special services in certain divisions of northern Gujarat and Saurashtra.

But with a large number of buses going off the roads due to technical reasons, special services became a distant dream as the GSRTC found it difficult to continue its routine services.

However, with the timely approval of the grant, these defunct buses are now back on the roads.

The most affected was the Rajkot division, where nearly 140 buses have gone off the road, followed by Nadiad with a casualty of nearly 110 buses. Even at Junagadh and Bhavnagar division, more than 100 buses each are lying in the terminal due to lack of tyres and spare parts.

15,Solapur riots aimed at creating communal tension: Pro-BJP outfit,"MUMBAI: Rambhau Mhalgi Prabodhini (RMP), a pro-BJP outfit, has said that last monthâ€™s Solapur riots were a part of the systematic and pre- planned design to create communal tension. According to the RMP, whose team visited the district after the riots, the violence was not spontaneous in nature nor was it a reaction to the bandh,which was called to protest against alleged derogatory remarks about Prophet Mohammad.

The Prabodhini has also demanded an investigation by the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) into incidents of human rights abuse and allegedly apathetic attitude of the police department. Nine persons lost their lives in police firing, while three persons died in mob clashes. Around 338 shops and 110 vehicles were damaged or torched during the riots.

RMP has also condemned the police for its alleged partisan action of filing cases against members of Navratri mandals, booking them falsely as rioters. The police and state government was ill-equipped to handle the riots and the intelligence network of police was virtually non existent, it has alleged.

16,Gujarat polls unfair to fairer sex,"AHMEDABAD: If Chief Minister Narendra Modi does give tickets to 33 per cent woman candidates in the coming assembly elections, it will be nothing short of a revolution for the fairer sex.

In the last 15 years, their performance in assembly elections has gone from bad to worse.

There were 94 woman candidates in the 1995 elections, one of the highest ever, and only two managed to win. A mind-boggling 83 of them had to forfeit their deposits. In the three elections since 1990, only 10 women have made it to the Assembly of 182 seats!

No wonder then that the Congress and the BJP have been reluctant to give them a large number of seats. This was reflected in the 1998 elections, when the number of woman candidates fell to 49, of whom four were elected. The Congress had fielded eight candidates and the BJP six with an army of Independents making up the numbers.

State primary education minister Anandiben Patel admits women are never given ""a winning seat"", no matter which party nominates them. ""If there are 10 seats reserved for women, parties will choose the seats they are bound to lose,"" she says. ""Women have a better chance with the urban educated class, an electorate that is ready to accept a woman MLA, but no matter which party we may belong to,we never get such seats.""

Patel also believes Gujaratis are very happy when a woman of the family is elected to a prestigious position like mayor. However, once the term ends, the same family will pressure her to concentrate on playing wife or mother. ""As a result, they don''t remain active in the organisation and lose support of party workers, becoming politically irrelevant.""

Well known activist of the Ahmedabad Women''s Action Group (Awag) Ila Pathak believes the BJP is responsible for the slide to a large extent. ""There is no room for women''s equality in Hindutva,"" she says. ""Look no further than a recent Bill introduced in Parliament against domestic violence. It has the term â€˜habitual battering'', which means a husband can say in his defence that he does not beat his wife regularly and was only protecting his property!""

Pathak also believes political parties never field more than 10 woman candidates and Independent woman candidates are unable to campaign aggressively.

For instance, in 1980 Kokilaben Vyas of the Congress won against Charumati Yoddha, whom everyone knew as a social worker par excellence. But then Yoddha was an Independent without any party backing.

""Whether you like it or not, we are still a chauvinistic society, where people like to deal with a man more than a woman,"" says Urvashidevi of Baria, who has spent 10 years in the state assembly and more than 20 years in politics. ""I can tell you from experience that we have to make more of an effort to prove ourselves.""

What is even more baffling is that in Gujarat''s less developed neighbours, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, woman candidates have fared much better. In the last assembly elections in Rajasthan, 69 women contested for the 200 seats and 14 of them won with comfortable margins.

Madhya Pradesh, on the other hand, had 181 woman candidates in the fray for 320 seats in 1998 and 26 of them made it to the Assembly.

17,Gujarat polls to have national impact: Rana,"AHMEDABAD: Gujarat BJP president Rajendrasinh Rana has stated categorically that the party will decide on candidates purely on the basis of a good track record, commitment and winnability, adding the 114 outgoing members will also have to fulfil these requirements to get renominated.

Referring to former chief minister Keshubhai Patelâ€™s voice of disagreement, the BJP chief clarified, ""Keshubhai is a disciplined and the seniormost party leader. He is also the convenor of the campaign committee. Contrary to fears in a section of the organisation, he will do nothing that harms the BJPâ€™s interest in the elections.""

In an interview to TNN,Rana ruled out the possibility of dissension among workers over the selection of candidates. He observed, ""Our three-tier process of selection of candidates is fool-proof. It will be a collective decision which will not leave any room for dissatisfaction."" A panel of three candidates for each constituency will be recommended by the observers and the central leadership will take a decision on the final list of candidates by November 15.

Asked to comment on the BJP''s prospects in the wake of the Gaurav Yatra, Rana said, ""It has evoked a spontaneous response, particularly among women and the youth. They are eagerly awaiting December 12 to vent their feelings over what they witnessed in the aftermath of the Godhra massacre.""

""The BJP has won the first battle by traversing 3,500 km and spreading the message of Hindutva through the yatra that has covered all 25 districts. There is no doubt the Congress will be defeated.""

Criticising the ""role of pseudo-secularists"" in defaming Gujarat during the communal riots, he said:""We will continue to expose these elements who have hurt the feelings of five crore Gujaratis in the state and 50 lakh non-resident Gujaratis."" Rana claimed that the electorate would reject the Congress and its leaders, including Shankersinh Vaghela.

""This election is going to give a new direction not only to Gujarat but to the whole nation,"" he said. Rana stated that security and development would be the two main planks of the BJP. ""We have promised a â€˜salamat'' and â€˜samruddh'' Gujarat to the voters.""

Rana said that the party would not leave any stone unturned to win the battle of ballots about which the central leadership was equally concerned. A battery of central leaders, including Prime Minister Vajpayee, deputy prime minister L K Advani, party president M Venkiah Naidu, Arun Jaitley, Sushma Swaraj, Rajnath Singh and Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, will be among the star campaigners.

18,Release arrested farmers: BJP,"BANGALORE: The State BJP on Saturday urged Governor T.N. Chaturvedi to direct the State government to release farmers, who have been arrested for Cauvery agitations, and to withdraw cases booked against them.

After submitting a memorandum, opposition leader Jagadish Shettar said the governor promised to look into the matter.

""A virtual police state has prevailed in the districts of Mandya, Mysore and Chamrajanagar, while innocent farmers have been targeted. Peaceful agitation is an accepted norm in democracy. It is ridiculous to book cases of attempt to murder on farmers who were demanding water for their crops,'''' he said.

Shettar said Chief Minister S.M. Krishna had no moral right to continue in office since he had sacrificed the interests of the state and its farmers for the sake of power. ``There was no reason for him to have disobeyed the Supreme Court in the first instance, if he was bent on obeying it the second time. Even if there is water now for release, the least the government could have done is to make the facts clear before resorting to the move,'''' he said.

He said the State should approach Prime Minister A.B. Vajpayee for a CRA meeting to ensure that the State did not suffer any further hardships.

Shettar said the party also urged the governor to direct the state to make concerted efforts in securing the release of former minister H. Nagappa from the clutches of Veerappan.

Shettar, opposition leader in the Council D.H. Shankara Murthy and other leaders later visited the Central Jail in Parappana Agrahara to meet arrested leaders from Mandya, including G. Made Gowda.

19,HC asks state govt to clarify caste policy,"MUMBAI: The Bombay high court has directed the Maharashtra government to declare its policy with regard to creamy layer among backward classes candidates contesting civic body elections.

The direction was given by chief justice C.K. Thakker and justice Ranjana Desai on two public interest litigations (PILs) challenging the election of a corporator of the Pimpri-Chinchwad civic body. The matter has been adjourned to December 11.

One petition said Prakash Rawale was elected from ward 35, reserved for other backward castes. Rawale is a Maratha and not Kunbi as claimed by the corporator, it added.

The petition said Rawale was among the creamy layer of backward castes and argued that a nine-judge bench of the supreme court had held that the benefit of reservations should be given to those who do not belong to the creamy layer.

While the judgement related to education and employment, it should also be applicable for elections, the PIL contended, and urged the court to inquire into the validity of Rawaleâ€™s caste certificate.
