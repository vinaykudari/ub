1,SGPC stance puts central government in tight spot,"chandigarh: will the strained indo-pak relations cast their shadow on the visit of the sikh devotees to pakistan? unlike what it had decided in the wake of the kargil conflict, the sgpc this time does not want that to happen and has been instead insisting that the 1,800-strong jatha of sikh devotees be allowed to visit gurdwaras in pakistan on the occasion of baisakhi on april 13. with road and rail links snapped with pakistan in the wake of the december 13 militant attack on parliament, the centre, however, has maintained a stoic silence on the sgpc''s request. the sgpc''s stance is likely to corner the centre on the matter, for either way it would be a hard decision for the centre to make. while it might not like to hurt the sikh sentiments by denying them their right to visit gurdwaras in pakistan, it would also not like to send signals of compromise to pakistan. during the kargil crisis, the sgpc had, however, toed the centre''s policy of distancing itself from pakistan, and had banned sending jathas to pakistan as a mark of protest. this time, though, even as devotees are keeping their fingers crossed in the absence of any definite communication from the centre with less than a week to go, the sgpc has shot a number of letters to the union home ministry in the last few days, seeking early clearance for the devotees. officials, here, feel that the centre''s decision to allow the sikh jatha hinges on whether the centre would, at this stage, like to send any positive signals to pakistan for normalising relations. after taking an extreme step of suspending the samjhauta express and severing road links with pakistan, it would be for the first time, if at all, that the centre would be restoring transport link with pakistan, albeit partially. it is pertinent to mention that the invitation to visit the sikh shrines was sent to the sgpc by the pakistan gurdwara prabandhak committee, which, in its communication, promised that it would make all arrangements for the visiting devotees and ensure their safety. the pakistan embassy has also expressed its readiness to grant visas to all those willing to pay obeisance at the sikh shrines there. the sgpc has already submitted a list of 1,600 devotees, both, to the centre and the state. besides the sgpc, the delhi sikh gurdwara committee also proposes to send a jatha to pakistan. if the centre declines to grant its clearance to the jathas, quite a few sikh devotees might visit pakistan by air.

2,Minimum support price cruel joke on farmers: Bhattal,"sangrur:reacting over a mere increase of rs 10 in the msp of wheat, punjab rural development minister rajinder kaur bhathal, addressing a function at lehragaga, on wednesday, said it was a cruel joke on debt-ridden farmers of punjab. she said the akalis, who claimed to be the farmersâ€™ friends, should also come forward to pressurise the vajpayee government to increase the msp. bhattal said they would lodge their protest over the measly increase in the msp for wheat and ask the centre to provide relief. she said the government would develop rural areas and all efforts would be made to provide better facilities, including sewerage, to villages. the flying squads, she said, would be formed to monitor development projects in villages and to ensure that subsidies reached the needy. former haryana minister and convener of the haryana krishak samaj, nirmal singh, told the times of india in ambala on thursday that despite the 10-rupee hike in msp, farmers would suffer, owing to the high production cost per acre. he said that against a production cost of rs 10,000 per acre, farmers who had taken land on lease would be able to get only rs 8,700, going by the msp fixed by the government. he said that the revised msp was a joke on farmers who were facing losses for the last two years because of the â€˜â€˜anti-farmerâ€� policy of the government.

4,Punjab in favour of MSP policy,"chandigarh: the punjab government has told the high-level committee of the ministry of food and consumer affairs that was in favour of retaining a minimum support price (msp) policy and strengthening the public distribution system (psd) to augment the off-take from buffer stocks. the high-powered committee, led by prof abhijit sen, was here get inputs from the state government for the formulation of a long-term grain policy.'' the committee had a meeting with punjab chief minister amarinder singh, agriculture minister rajinder kaur bhattal, minister of food and supplies lal singh. talking to reporters after the meeting,amarinder clarified that his government was committed to diversification, but it was a long and capital intensive process for which it would need genuine support from the union government. amarinder said the punjab farmer was willing to go for diversification of crops but he had to be adequately compensated. not only should there be a market for the new farm produce, but it should yield the same dividend as the farmer gets from wheat-paddy rotation. the punjab government is averse to jettisoning the msp-policy on the illusionary notion of surplus food stocks, on the argument that the consumption of food grains in much less than the optimum requirement because of lack of purchasing capacity. regarding the policy on buffer stocks, amarinder pointed out that the fci cleared out its own stocks, while those of the state procurement agencies continued to mount. he urged that the stocks should be moved much faster to create space for storage of fresh arrivals. the cm strongly dismissed all apprehensions that the sowing of bt cotton could lead to pollution of the environment, arguing that it had been used all over the world without any hazardous results. on the contrary, he pointed out, the present varieties were exposed to 25 to 27 pesticides sprays to protect them from the american bollworm which had affected the soil and environment, and proved more dangerous to farmers spraying the pesticides. unfolding punjab's plan on bt cotton, he said punjab would procure seeds for farm trial this year. ''the process of shifting bt cotton would take a couple of years,'' he added, saying he was confident that there would not be any problem.

7,Sale of water-suction pumps increases,"lucknow: increase in sale of water-suction pumps is the latest in the city that continues to face its regular dose of four-hour daily power cuts. low water pressure has also forced city denizens to connect tullu pumps directly to water pipelines, an activity that is banned. since the power cut is from 10 am to 2 pm, the office-goers and schoolchildren are also facing trying times. â€œ since it is office time, we have to rush through our daily chores as water scarcity is a big problem,â€� said divya sharma of butler palace. housewives too are facing their share of problems as washing of clothes and other sundry daily chores takes a beating. the low income group which depends largely on a regular water supply has to store water in buckets and drums to tide over the crunch period. â€œunlike us, houses with storage tanks have no such water problems,â€� says anita of vinay khand, gomtinagar. the middle andlower income group have to resort to use of suction pumps attached to the main water line to fill up their small tanks. a resident of asharfabad complained that in many instances leakages in water pipelines result from being punctured by people for installing tullu pumps for domestic use. manohar tiwari, a resident of thakurganj lamented that he had to walk long distance to get water as the government handpump was lying defunct. â€œdue to the constant water problems, i have recently bought two tanks of 80 litres each,â€� said mala of indiranagar, adding that she used suction pumps. since low water pressure and subsequent use of suction pumps requires electricity, people are facing problems in filling their tanks. fear of extra power cuts has forced swati of rajajipuram to plan a masonry water tank to store water. residents of high-rise buildings in some colonies of chowk face the problem of lifting water during the power cuts. the affluent class seems to be almost unaffected as they own jetpumps operated by gensets.

9,"Muslim moderates, hardliners clash","mumbai: a symposium on police and minoritiesâ€™ at the anjuman-i-islam school here on tuesday degenerated into a confrontation between the muslim moderates and hardliners. things turned ugly when a section of the audience took offence at the way the president of anjuman-i-islam, ishaq jamkhanawala, who was chairing the seminar, admonished a questioner. asked what the community ought to do to ensure that it could live with dignity in india, jamkhanawala, a moderate, said education was the only way out, and then lashed out against the fundamentalists, whom he accused of keeping the muslims backward. a pandemonium broke out as several in the audience objected to the tone and tenor of jamkhanawalaâ€™s reply. hardly had the dust settled down, when abu asim azmi, the city unit president of the samajwadi party, got up to say that his sympathies were with the uneducated muslims who rose to the defence of the religion when mosques were attacked rather than the educated elite who restricted themselves to statements. by this time, the atmosphere was no longer conducive to a reasoned debate, and jamkhanawalaâ€™s view that muslims ought to use democratic means of protest, such as articles in newspapers and seminars, went unheard. several youngsters, who had come from far-off places such as bhiwandi and mumbra, echoed azmi, who said that the police were not allowing them to vent their feelings in public. however, the first discordant note in the seminar came when s.m. syed, additional police commissioner for south mumbai, walked out of the seminar in protest against retired high court judge s.m. daudâ€™s comment that even a 25 per cent reservation for muslims in the police would not help as the police force was â€œcorrupt and was a tool in the hands of the oppressorsâ€�.

10,Experts debate juvenile law,"new delhi: the incarceration of three juveniles in tihar jail for allegedly stealing a watch in lodhi gardens has raised questions about whether our lawmakers and lawkeepers know how to deal with them. two of the boys are out on bail while the third is still languishing in jail. concerned citizens have been outraged at the treatment meted out to the boys despite the existence of a juvenile justice act which lays down exactly how juvenile offenders should be treated. former additional solicitor general k t s tulsi said the magistrates had failed to perform their duty according to the law. â€˜â€˜allowing the boys to remain in jail even as the age verification process was on is a violation of the law,â€™â€™ he said. abhishek manu singhvi, former additional solicitor general, says the police officials concerned should be punished for the lapse. â€˜â€˜the juvenile justice act was formulated to ensure that a person below 18 years of age is not incarcerated in the normal manner, even for the most heinous crime like murder. this does not mean that the accused escapes punishment but only that he or she has to be lodged at an observation home where precedence is given to reformation. if the boys have been incarcerated in tihar jail, despite being juveniles, they have been wrongly put behind bars. each one of them has the right to claim damages under the legal procedure of â€˜tortâ€™. the children have the right to file a case against the state,â€™â€™ he said. anita pandit, member of the juvenile welfare board also felt that sending the boys to tihar was against the very spirit of the jja. â€˜â€˜the juvenile justice system is meant to reform offenders. by putting them in close proximity of hardened criminals, that very purpose was lost.â€™â€™ senior advocate and social activist indira jaisingh came down heavily on the police. â€˜â€˜this is a clear case of police negligence. action can be initiated against the erring officials. the police should have started a verification process soon after the boys claimed they were juveniles. even the courts did not pay heed to the boysâ€™ representation. the police have made a grave mistake. but the court should have acted promptly and conducted an inquiry conducted since the boysâ€™ families had also claimed that they were juveniles,â€™â€™ she said. she, however, added that our remedial procedure is long and tedious. â€˜â€˜if courts take days to find out whether the boy is a juvenile or not, it might take years to compensate the boys,â€™â€™ she said. taking a different view, jitendra nagpal, psychiatrist at the vidyasagar institute of mental health and allied sciences said violent behaviour in children was rising at an alarming rate and needed to be looked at from other perspectives. â€˜â€˜there is a serious emerging trend of aggressive, defiant and oppositional behaviour in children and adolescents. the cause of this phenomenon has been largely ignored. but everywhere, children and adolescents are turning violent, even resorting to heinous crimes. this is a problem which has to be recognised because these children will enter the world of adult criminals tomorrow. the problem of delinquency spans all sections of society and to tackle it effectively we need mental health counselling, especially in schools. the law cannot be a helpline.â€™â€™

13,"George, Shahnawaz sing different tunes on development","gaya: defence minister george fernandes and civil aviation minister syed shahnawaz hussain who were here on tuesday in connection with the foundation-laying ceremony of the ambitious gaya airport development project, were seen to be on different wavelengths on the issue of the road map of the economic development of the state. whereas, in his speech shahnawaz hussain favoured a consensus and non-confrontationist political approach to ensure bihar''s economic development, george fernandes queered the pitch by indulging in the blame game and virtually holding the present regime in the state responsible for all the ills. the ball was set rolling by union minister of state for coal and mines ravi shankar prasad, who in his speech emphasised the need to end politicking in the larger interest of bihar and make joint efforts by different political parties to get for bihar its rightful place. prasad said that partisan political interest should not be allowed to come in the way of the execution of an economic agenda for the growth of the state. he also said that bodh gaya had immense potential to give a fillip to the bihar economy through the growth of the tourist industry. ravi shankar''s line on the issue was promptly lapped up by the bihar energy minister who echoed similar sentiments and appreciated the gesture made by his former colleague of the patna high court. khan went on to say that opposition for the sake of opposition was injurious to the state''s economic interests. in this respect, he appreciated the response of the non-rjd mps of the state who attended a meeting convened by him in delhi to discuss the strategy to deal with the power crisis in the state. shahnawaz hussain in his speech adopted the same attitude and hoped that the civil aviation ministry and the bihar government will work together for the expansion, renovation and modernisation of the infrastructure in the state. he also hoped that shakeel ahmed khan would be instrumental in removing the bottlenecks of land acquisition for the expansion of the patna airport which was found wanting in safety specifications on account of space constraints. but the apparent bonhomie was too good to last as defence minister george fernandes adopted a politically aggressive line and virtually predicted doom for the state on account of poor law and order, naxalite activities. he went on to say that nothing good was going to happen to bihar so long as private capital did not come to the state in a big way, something that was unlikely to happen in the present circumstances. whatever investment has been made in bihar in the recent years has been made by the union government in the aviation sector, development of the railways and the rs 1,500 crore ordnance factory at rajgir. but private capital has not been coming to the state. without referring to the bihari pride shown by hussain on more than one occasion in his speech, fernandes said that he was no less a bihari as despite being born somewhere else, bihar has sent him to parliament on no less than seven occasions.
