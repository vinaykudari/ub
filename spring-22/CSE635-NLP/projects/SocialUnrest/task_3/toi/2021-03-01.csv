0,Kingpin of Rana's escape arrested in Meerut,"NEW DELHI: The special cell of Delhi Police has arrested two men who allegedly helped Sher Singh Rana, the prime accused in Phoolan Devi murder case, escape from Tihar jail on February 17.

The main accused in the case, Sandeep Thakur (22), was arrested from a village in Meerut on Saturday.

When a police team reached Thakur''s residence in Roorkee, they were told that he had shifted base to Meerut.

The police said Thakur had posed as constable Arvind Kumar of Delhi Armed Police and asked for Rana in Tihar jail for his scheduled appearance in Roshanabad Court at Haridwar on February 17.

He then, apparently, walked out of the jail with Rana and took an autorickshaw to ISBT from where they boarded a bus to Ghaziabad.

""Thakur was subjected to sustained interrogation during which he revealed the involvement of another man, Vikram Singh (24). Both of them used to meet Rana in the Haridwar court where they planned his escape,"" said deputy commissioner of police (special cell) Ashok Chand.

Singh has also been arrested.

1,No feel-good factor for farmers,"HOSHIARPUR: The ''feel good factor'' is set to lose all its sheen as the farming community starts feeling the pinch as prices of farm implements, including trolleys, disc harrow, tillers, centrifugal pumps and seeddrills increase because of the rise in steel and iron prices across the country. Sample this: For Partap Singh of Haryana, the price rise in iron and steel is not a ''feel good factor''.

Not that, Partap Singh is interested in the nitty-gritty of the factors that are influencing the price rise, it is because his budget has been shaken as he cannot by a disc harrow as per plan because the cost has gone up 20 per cent since the last one month.

The same disc harrow that cost Rs 13,000 in January is now being sold at Rs 16,000 because of the unprecedented rise in iron.

""Pehlan le lande ta change rehnade-mahine which hi kimat asman no lag gai hai (I wish I had bought it last month as prices have sky-rocketed). Uchiyaan khedan ne (there are big games being played at the top level), matthar noon ki pata (what does a peasant know,'''' says Partap Singh.

Farmers have virtually stopped buying farm implements, says Tehal Singh, owner of Modern Industries and President Agriculture Implements Manufacturer association. Cost of implements has gone up by at least 20 per cent, says Tehal Singh and the farmers do not have the buying capacity. He says iron that was available at Rs 18 a kilo a month ago is now at Rs 25 per kilo.

Gurmail Singh, a farmer of Nella Naloiyan village, says that his wheat will sell at the same minimum support price (MSP) whereas the cost of implements has gone up manifold.

And while this is not enough tractor prices are also set for a rise.

Amrit Sagar Mittal, managing director of the 500 crore International Tractors Limited, told Times News Network that the tractors manufacturing association has decided to raise tractor prices by March 10 as it had become impossible to sell them at the same price.

He says sops like excise duty cut will only benefit the manufacturer and the middleman. He said the problem is of scarcity of steel and huge amount of steel needs to be imported to solve the problem. Tara Singh Bilga, a leading manufacturer of trolleys in the region, says that a 14 feet trolley that cost Rs 45,000 is now costing Rs 56,000.

He says that no farmer has the paying capacity to buy such expensive trolleys. With such a situation at ground level is India really shining?

2,Amarinder: Cong will sweep the polls,"LUDHIANA: Maintaining that he did not expect the announcement of Lok Sabha election on Sunday, Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh expressed confidence that his party would sweep the polls in the state.

The CM was in the middle of a thanksgiving religious function organised by MLA Surinder Dawar to mark successful completion of two years of the Congress government at a local college in Kidwai Nagar locality here. It was PPCC president H S Hanspal who said during the function that the dates for the LS polls have been announced.

Expectedly, the CM apologised to the gathering for his inability to make some announcements due to enforcement of election of code of conduct.

But this would not pose any disadvantage to his party as required funds have already been sanctioned for works undertaken by the government departments during the last three months, he informed.

Amarinder also said that senior Congress leader Manmohan Singh won''t be contesting the polls from Jalandhar. In an exclusive conversation with TNN on way to Raghunath Enclave in the city for a personal visit after the function, he admitted that the announcement was not expected on Sunday.

""We expected it to be sometime in the first week of March as conveyed to the election commission but a week ahead will not in any way affect us,'''' he said. Besides wheat harvesting, the annual examinations are likely to be over by May 10, the date fixed for the polls in Punjab. The CM landed at Sahnewal airport from Delhi, about 15 kms from the city in the airplane owned by central Congress leader Kamal Nath.

On his claims to sweep the polls, the CM is banking on about 15 per cent floating votes in favour of his party candidates besides the traditional Congress vote bank. He sounded confident about making inroads in the traditional Akali vote bank of farmers on the basis of transparent and corruption-free crop procurement during his tenure so far.

He discounted any adverse impact of delay in announcement of the party candidates as compared to the Akalis. The party could win nine seats in the state last time despite the fact that it got only a fortnight for campaigning, he argued. The CM said the process of finalising the candidates would be completed shortly.

He clarified that all the sitting Congress MPs from the states would contest from the respective seats. However, he did not rule out the possibility of fielding a couple of new faces but declined to disclose names of such prospective candidates.

3,Pathankot SDM arrested for poaching,"PATHANKOT/HOSHIARPUR: Pathankot sub-divisional magistrate Puneet Goyal was arrested for poaching in the forests of Narur area in Hoshiarpur district on Sunday morning while his two accomplices reportedly managed to escape. The trio have been booked under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972.

According to the damage report filed by the forest department, two peahens and four dead partridges were recovered from a Mahindra jeep in which the trio was alleged to be poaching. The forest officials have also recovered a licensed .12 bore gun and some live cartridges.

Kulraj Singh, range officer (Hoshiarpur), said that the SDM was caught at about 9:30 am after a special-tip off. The forest department had laid a trap on the intervening night of Saturday and Sunday and patrolling had been intensified in areas of Mangrowal, Dholbaha but they had failed to catch anybody.

According to Kulraj Singh, a forest team that included range officers of Hariana and Dholbaha, forester Rakesh Sharma and wildlife inspector Tarsem Lal spotted a jeep on Sunday morning and cornered it. After searching the vehicle, six dead birds, including a weapon were recovered. However, the SDM claimed that he was being framed in a false case by the wild life wardens and he had gone to Hariana to spend his weekend.

Sources said that Gurdaspur deputy commissioner Harjeet Singh and SSP Narinder Bhargava were camping at Hoshiarpur. Meanwhile, 100-odd villagers of Narur made a representation to Hoshiarpur DC asking him to reinvestigate the case, as they felt that the SDM had been framed.

4,Hurriyat rules out meeting Vohra,"NEW DELHI: The Centre-Hurriyat talks continued to teeter on the brink of collapse as Hurriyat chief Maulana Abbas Ansari on Sunday ruled out a meeting with central interlocutor N N Vohra, who is being rushed to the Kashmir valley to keep the negotiations going.

The decision to boycott Vohra was announced by Ansari after the state authorities clamped down attempts by the separatist groups to take out a Muharram procession.

The state government was of the view that taking out the procession could lead to security problems in Srinagar.

Ansari was put under house arrest, while detractors of the talks like Syed Ali Shah Geelani were detained.

An upset Ansari announced that he was in no mood to talk to Vohra, who was scheduled to visit Srinagar this week.

""There is no question of meeting Vohra,"" he said. The occasion gave him an opportunity to announce Hurriyatâ€™s traditional stand of poll boycott.

""Election is not in our aims and objectives. Kashmir problem cannot be settled through polls,"" Ansari told reporters.

Asked if Hurriyat would give a call for boycott of the Lok Sabha elections, he replied in the negative, but hastily added that time alone would decide.

5,Turnout crucial in J&K election,"JAMMU: The first state off the block for the election sweepstakes is Jammu and Kashmir. Chief minister Mufti Mohammed Sayeed began his election-related rallies a month ago, just about the time that the principal secessionist leader, Syed Ali Shah Geelani, began his boycott-election campaign.

This is but a slice of the many-layered reality of Kashmir. Sample the others: Ten days ago, Mufti addressed a 15,000-strong rally in Sopore, the heartland of secessionist sentiment.

Last week, Geelani gathered a similar sized crowd at Kulgam for the funeral of a Hizbul Mujahideen district commander Abdul Majeed Wani aka Arif Khan who was gunned down by the security forces.

In 2002, some one-fifth of the people of the Kashmir region or one-tenth of the entire state, boycotted the assembly elections. But, by the same measure, many more participated.

Separatists in the state now have to contend with the possibility that Pakistan may not allow any replenishment, reinforcement or rotation of militants in the Valley across the Line of Control.

Over time, and this could be a matter of months, the militant groups in the Valley, be they Kashmiri or Pakistani, will have no fighting capacity left.

In these circumstances, there appears to have been a change of tactics. This has been manifested by the civil protests against alleged human rights violations in the Valley.

It began with a February 9 incident when five porters died when a terrorist assumed dead by the Army opened up with a light machine gun.

Three army personnel also died in the incident. But the locals claimed that the army had used them as human shields. The situation in the area has remained tense since then.

In another unrelated incident, a person was shot dead by the police to disperse a violent mob that grew out of a minor quarrel.

Every day, the security forces conduct hundreds of raids looking for terrorists. Undoubtedly in some cases, there is high-handedness and in a few, there is use of excessive force.

There is no excuse for the custodians of the law to break it and the government is only now realising how important it is to ensure that the security forces operate in a zero-error regime.

But this is easier said than done. The kind of training and forces needed for the job don''t exist.

6,Centre told to lay rules for HIV+ sailors,"MUMBAI: The Bombay High Court has directed the Union government to enumerate in an affidavit on March 3, the existing rules for considering extension of job tenure for sailors in Indian Navy who are HIV positive.

The direction was given by Justice Ajit Shah and Justice S C Dharmadhikari on a petition filed by a sailor this week who was refused extension merely on the grounds that he was HIV positive.

The petitioner''s 15-year contract came to an end on January 31, 2003 and as per the practice he asked for a three-year extension. However, his application was rejected on the ground that he was HIV positive. He then moved the HC challenging the decision of the authorities.

The petitioner was diagnosed as HIV positive during his 15-year contract period. However, he was allowed to complete the term. Thereafter his request for extension was not considered.

He urged the court to withhold his name from the media. The court said the government cannot come out with a blanket rule of not giving extension to any sailor who was HIV positive.
