1,"State interested in 700 MW of power, govt tells Centre","MUMBAI: In a major shift in its policy, the Maharashtra government has informed the Centre that it would be interested in obtaining 700 MW of power from the controversial Enron project, which has been lying unused because of the litigations surrounding it.

Chief minister Sushilkumar Shinde told reporters here on Wednesday that negotiations were underway with the IDBI and other authorities about the Enron tariff and the conditionalities connected with it. But the litigations filed in London and the US needed to be kept in mind while proceeding in the matter, he added.

Former chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh had steadfastly opposed the Enron project, which was started by then chief minister Sharad Pawar way back in 1993.

Ever since, the Rs 9,500 crore project has been facing one controversy after another as political equations change in Maharashtra.

While the Sena-BJP alliance government tried to revive it, the Deshmukh regime ensured that it was shut down. After Shinde took over the reins, efforts started afresh to revive the project, especially in view of the serious power shortages that have become a daily feature of life in rural parts of the state.

Electricity board chairman Asoke Basak said that the deficit at the moment was between 1,200 MW and 1,600 MW. It could increase up to 2,000 MW, he told reporters.

2,MCD needs policy to check illegal construction: HC,"NEW DELHI: The Delhi High Court has pulled up the Municipal Corporation of Delhi for its failure to check unauthorised construction.

Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul said: â€˜â€˜I fail to appreciate how such construction can go on right upto the top floor without it coming to the notice of the concerned assistant or executive engineer.â€™â€™

He said the civic agency takes action only when a resident approaches the court complaining against unauthorised construction work by his neighbour.

Kaul has directed the municipal commissioner to form a policy for a periodic verification of the construction taking place in various parts of the city.

6,Who is Sitaram Yadav? State's PR minister,"PATNA: A public relations minister is supposed to be the spokesperson of the government. However, very few, if any, would have seen, read or heard Rabri governmentâ€™s PR minister Sitaram Yadav speaking to the media about the governmentâ€™s work in the last four years of RJD governmentâ€™s third term.

But now the PR minister has gained voice. He speaks on law and order one day and on fiscal discipline another day.

On yet another day, he issues press releases on the governmentâ€™s commitment to preserve the stateâ€™s cultural heritage.

Yadav has amused his ministerial colleagues. But they donâ€™t offer prizes for guessing at the reason behind the change in the PR ministerâ€™s â€œstyle of functioningâ€�. â€œCM Rabri Devi had publicly rapped him at a party function held to announce the election of Abdul Bari Siddiqui as the new state party unit chief,â€� recalled one. The CM had said she had never seen or heard PRD minister Yadav speaking about the achievements of the government.

The minister has got the message. On Tuesday he was seen urging fellow ministers to send details about the achievements of their respective departments.

â€œThere are people out to defame us and our government. We will answer them with concrete figures,â€� he said.

Indeed, ruling party politicians, including RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav, appear to have suddenly become â€œimage consciousâ€�. Ministers have been instructed to â€œcooperateâ€� with media persons and answer their queries in â€œJanata Darbarsâ€�.

The RJD chief, who once ridiculed information technology saying â€œyeh IT-YT kya hota haiâ€�, is now inaugurating IT institutes. â€œI donâ€™t know what the media has spread about me and computers. But RJD government is committed to developing IT in the state,â€� he told media persons on Tuesday, refusing to be drawn into any controversy following the laptop demonstration held for state legislators on Monday.

7,NDA leaders to campaign jointly for bypolls,"PATNA: The NDA constituents on Wednesday decided to undertake joint election campaign in favour of the NDA nominees for the November 20 bypolls to Sitamarhi, Fatuha and Barachatti seats of the state assembly.

While the BJP is contesting Sitamarhi seat, the unified JD-U is contesting Fatuha and Barachatti seats.

A decision to this effect was taken on Wednesday evening at a high-level meeting of the state NDA which was presided over by its convener Nand Kishore Yadav. The meeting was held at the BJP headquarters. Nand Kishore Yadav said after the meeting that an NDA delegation will on Thursday submit a memorandum to Chief Electoral Officer (CEO), Bihar, Afzal Amanullah, to demand free, fair and impartial poll in Sitamarhi and Fatuha.

Nand Kishore Yadav said that the NDA had lost Fatuha and Sitamarhi seats in the general election to the state assembly in the year 2000 because of partisan role of the local administration.

This was evident from the fact that the election of sitting members from these two seats was set aside. He said that top NDA leaders, state BJP president Gopal Narain Singh, Samata Party leaders Bashistha Narayan Singh and Upendra Kushwaha and JD-U leader Ganesh Prasad Yadav, were prominent among those who attended the meeting.

8,Reliance 'info' angers state govt,"PATNA: Tourism minister Ashok Kumar Singh said his department is going to file a defamation suit against Reliance Infocomm for the â€œuncharitable and motivatedâ€� remarks against Bihar it had put on its Reliance India Mobile (RIM) website, R-World.

Addressing a press conference here on Wednesday, Singh said the remarks against Bihar put by the company on R-World were a motivated bid to defame the state and adversely affect its tourism. â€œI have instructed the tourism department officials to file a defamation suit against the officials of the company,â€� he stated.

He alleged that R-World available to all RIM consumers had carried unfounded and false contents relating to Bihar. The website had maintained that Bihar was unsafe for tourists on account of its poor law and order situation. It had referred to poor facilities available at the Hotel Tathagat Vihar in Rajgir run by the Bihar State Tourism Development Corporation. The website had also referred to mosquito menace in the state. The contents were later withdrawn following protests from leaders of the ruling party in the state, including RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav.

â€œThere was not an iota of truth in what was written on the website. We have made inquiry after we came to know about the contents on the website. There is not a single tourist coming to the state who has been affected by criminal activities,â€� the minister claimed. He stressed that facilities are being increased at hotels run by the corporation. â€œWe even provide tooth brushes and other items to tourists at Tathagat Vihar,â€� he said. The minister said tourism is on the rise in Bihar. â€œWe earned around Rs 36 crore in 2002 from tourism,â€� he said.

Reliance Infocomm refused to comment â€œAll I can say is that we have a high regard for the people of Bihar, including Laloo Yadav. Right now the website does not contain any uncharitable remark against Bihar,â€� said a Kolkata-based spokesperson of the company.

11,J&K govt for a rethink on CRPF,"SRINAGAR/UDHAMPUR: Though the Centreâ€™s plan to replace the Border Security Force (BSF) with the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) in Jammu and Kashmir is formally on, the Jammu and Kashmir government seems to be having second thoughts.

While CRPF heads insisted they were ready to take charge, first in Srinagar and then in rest of the Valley, deputy chief minister Mangat Ram Sharma said he would urge the Centre to review the decision.

He said the BSF was well-versed with the stateâ€™s topography and had been instrumental in neutralising top militants. Speaking to reporters at a passing-out parade of the BSF in Udhampur, Sharma said BSFâ€™s continuous presence in the state was needed at this juncture.

At Srinagar, CRPF inspector-general V B Singh said his personnel would begin taking charge of parts of the old city from the mid-November. They would then extend their deployment.
