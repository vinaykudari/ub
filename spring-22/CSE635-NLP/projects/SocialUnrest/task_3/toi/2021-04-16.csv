0,"Now, newspapers to account for political ads","NEW DELHI: Newspapers will now be answerable for the political advertisements they carry and will have to furnish details in a particular form to the state election commission, regarding the address and the identity of the agency placing the advertisement.

After directives of the Election Commission of India, Delhi state election commission has sent out notices to the newspapers to ascertain the identity and address of the agency or person placing a political advertisement.

Delhi chief electoral officer Arun Goyal said: ""We have been asked to keep a check on all the ads. According to the latest directives, we have to treat the ads in the newspapers like political pamphlets.

""This would mean that the newspapers, if they place an ad, would have to submit a form which the printers of political pamphlets also do.""

This step has been taken following a spate of slanderous political advertisements in the media. Under Section 127A of Representation of the People Act, 1951, any printer publishing election posters and pamphlets has to establish the identity of the agency or person getting it printed, by filling a form with the name and address.

Any printer failing to do so could get six months'' imprisonment, or a fine, or both.

""These would be the same rules that would govern a newspaper also. They will have to fill and submit the prescribed form to the chief electoral officer within 48 hours of publishing the ad,"" said Goyal.

Special instructions were sent for Delhi because of the spate of political advertisements on dengue and failure of the Congress government before the Assembly elections.

Goyal said: ""At that time when we tried to trace the agencies, we could not as there was no record of who placed those ads. Some ads were attributed to untraceable organisations. This is why there are clear instructions this time.""

1,Delhi's political battleground all set for May 10,"NEW DELHI: Each battle deserves a battle cry, and so it is with the Lok Sabha polls. Variously, Bofors, India shining, feel good, feel bad, feel awful, have all been heard across the country. Delhi, however, seems to be dancing to its own tune; in fact, all seven electoral wars in the city seem to have their own theme song.

South Delhi: It has two ""near relatives"" V K Malhotra of the BJP and R K Anand of the Congress â€” they are cousins of some sort. Both are known to be motormouths, Anand because he is a lawyer and Malhotra because he is the BJP spokesperson. The theme song here is ""what''s the good word?"" as both promise a verbose fight. For both of them the Sikh vote is going to be crucial. Malhotra is fighting the anti-incumbency factor to retain his seat, while Anand is banking on the support of his MLAs and councillors. In a constituency chronically short of water, both of them will have their work cut out for them campaigning in peak summer.

Delhi Sadar: It''s one the oldest areas in the city, and the two who are pitted here BJP''s Vijay Goel and Congress'' Jagdish Tytler. They are poised for a feral fight, famed as they are for street smartness and good managerial skills. A small constituency means that the battle will be fought for every street and polling booth. Though the size of the constituency is small, the Election Commission will surely keep a close watch on the amount of money that is expected to be pumped in here. Tytler and Goel both have lined up several film stars and both of them will keep the city entertained till the elections.

Outer Delhi: This constituency has two Jat strongmen in the ring. If Sahib Singh Verma is the local boy made good who is being asked to account for neglect of his constituency, Sajjan Kumar''s is the prodigal return. After being out of the electoral fray for 10 years, following allegations of his involvement in the anti-Sikh riots, he looks lean and hungry, out to settle scores for being benched for the better part of the match.

Singh has not faced any real opposition on this seat during his absence. Sajjan has a large number of followers who have waited for a decade to fight this election. This constituency is expected to witness the maximum violence in the city.

New Delhi: Its the classic battle of old versus young. The nearly octogenarian Jagmohan versus the young, dapper Ajay Maken, exactly 40 years old this year. Both have a clean image, a reputation for hard work and are poster boys for the ""minister at work"" tag. Both are Punjabi, and have an easy relationship with the media. One can almost mistake them for a before and after picture. An interesting fight, between youth and age.

East Delhi: It''s the home-grown versus the political heir. BJP sitting MP Lal Bihari Tiwari insists that he is the face of East Delhi, populated by lakhs of high caste migrants from western Uttar Pradesh and Bihar (called Purvanchalis).

He takes on this time Sandeep Dikshit, son of Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit, grandson of Congressman Uma Shankar Dikshit, half Brahmin, half Punjabi and perfect fodder for the dynasty crazed country. Though Tiwari is banking on the Purvanchali vote and an active RSS cadre in this constituency, Dikshit will have the support of his mom''s full cabinet, specially education minister Arvindar Singh Lovely, finance minister A K Walia and parliamentary secretary to the CM Naseeb Singh.

This constituency will see the visit of all Congress and BJP stars coming to campaign for their respective candidates.

Karol Bagh: This seat is a women only affair, with BJP''s Anita Arya pitted against Congress'' Krishna Tirath. Put plainly, it''s a Hobson''s choice, with both candidates mouthing rehearsed lines, and remaining in the shadows of mainstream politics despite their impressive electoral records. Arya is a former Mayor of the city and Tirath a former minister and deputy speaker of the Delhi Assembly. But any effort to recall a fixed image is a wasteful exercise. This constituency will witness the most insipid election this time.

Chandni Chowk: Kapil Sibal is a surprise nominee from this constituency. After Vijay Goel fled away from this constituency, it was widely regarded to be a safe seat for Congress. Sibal being a Punjabi contesting from a Muslim and Baniya dominated constituency has surprised all local Congress leaders.

But BJP is in no better shape here. They don''t have a strong candidate. Councillor Vijendra Kumar Gupta, Arun Jain and television star Smriti ''Tulsi'' Irani are the forefront runners for this seat. The fight will not be very interesting here.

2,Man immolates self in protest,"RAJKOT: Nanji Rajani (65) of Lambabandar town in Jamnagar district committed suicide on Thursday by torching himself on Gondal Road opposite Atul Auto Limitedâ€™s showroom. The deceased, along with his wife Lalitaben, had been on fast in front of Atul Auto Ltdâ€™s office since March 22 to protest against the companyâ€™s decision to not compensate him despite winning a case in the consumer court.

Rajani had purchased an autorickshaw from Atul Auto Ltd in 1995 and had sought a replacement or money in return for his vehicle which was damaged immediately after purchase. However, as there was no response to his demand from company authorities, Rajani filed a complaint in the consumer court in 2001. The court ruled in Rajaniâ€™s favour. But company owner Jayanti Chandra appealed against the ruling.

As Rajani had earlier threatened to commit suicide on April 15 if he did not receive justice, police bandobast had been arranged, but taking advantage of time between change in duty on Thursday morning Rajani torched himself.

Mourning her husbandâ€™s death, Rajani said, "" He lost his life because of the companyâ€™s refusal to compensate him. He was the only source of income for our family comprising two sons and four daughters.""

Meanwhile, the matter is being investigated by Pradhyumannagar Inspector S M Jadeja. Speaking to TNN he said,""We have registered a case of accidental death and the victimâ€™s body has been sent for postmortem. The report is being awaited and we are investigating the matter in detail.""

3,HC lawyers second Bar Council resolution on bakery,"AHMEDABAD: A day after the Bar Council of Gujarat passed a resolution expressing concern about the Supreme Court order on transferring the Best Bakery case to Maharastra, the Gujarat High Court Advocatesâ€™ Association on Thursday adopted the same resolution with an added assertion that the association will approach the apex court for a review if nobody else does.

The resolution was passed at an extraordinary general meeting which was convened after being requisitioned by 127 members. While 106 members voted for the resolution, six cast their votes against it.

""If the honourable apex court is not approached for review/modification of the judgment rendered in Best Bakery case, the Gujarat High Court Advocatesâ€™ Association will move appropriate proceedings for â€˜review/modification of the judgment,"" reads the resolution.

The resolution passed by the Bar Council â€” and adopted by the Gujarat High Court Advocatesâ€™ Association â€” had expressed its ""deep concern"" about the observations made by the apex court, as it may have an adverse effect on the anxiety of Gujarat judiciary to render justice.

Vijay H Patel proposed the resolution. However, there were members like Y F Mehta who disagreed stating that ""we should not pass any resolution against the judgment of the apex court as we cannot comment on any judgment"" Senior advocate Nirupam Nanavati, who voted against the resolution told TNN, ""The Supreme Court judgment cannot be questioned and criticised by members of the bar association, and everybody is bound to uphold the dignity of the highest judicial institution of the country.""

However, Yatin Oza, president of the association who chaired the meeting, reiterated that ""the Supreme Court could have set aside the judgment given by the trial court which was upheld by the High Court. But this is for the first time in the history of the country that a case has been transferred outside the state after an appeal was decided by a Division Bench of the High Court.""

4,Gomtipur violence smacks of poll agenda,"AHMEDABAD: The Wednesday night violence in the Gomtipur area here may well have subsided after an hour of stonethrowing and the torching of 4 shops and two auto-rickshaws, but poll observers and intelligence agencies suspect that the ruckus could have been aimed at political mileage in the ensuing Lok Sabha elections.

A total of 36 persons were arrested by the police for rioting and arson that left 15 injured. The trouble had its genesis in a music programme organised at the Shankarpura Ki Chali by the local BJP MLA Jitu Vaghela, a name which had also figured during the riots in 2002.

Hell broke loose after some stones were allegedly pelted by members of another community residing in immediate neighbourhood.

Petrol-bombs and acidbulbs followed as Hindu and Muslim residents of the locality clashed. Mobs poured out onto the narrow alleys and streets of the congested locality while some took up vantage points on roof-tops. The news of the violence spread like wildfire and adjoining localities like Mariam Bibi Ki Chali, Chhotelal Ki Chali and Prakashnagar also erupted soon after.

The police, which used a total of 85 teargas shells, resorted to lathicharge to drive the rioters back in their homes. Vaghela was called in for questioning.

However, the reason behind Wednesdayâ€™s violence still remains a mystery even as Vaghela alleges that it were the Muslims who started it.

But central poll observers have expressed fear that this could just be the beginning of low intensity pre-poll violence in order to polarise the voters. Intelligence agencies, corroborating the observations, said that the temperature had suddenly picked up following the VHPâ€™s decision of helping the BJP in its campaign. The VHP announcement came after a state-level meeting on Wednesday morning.

Given the scarcity of central paramilitary forces, the state police authorities, who fear recurrence of more such low intensity communal strifes, have approached the Election Commission for additional forces for poll duty.

5,"It’s party time, but no-show in Cong","AHMEDABAD: With barely five days left for polling in Gujarat, the ruling BJP has pulled out all stops in its campaign for the 26 Lok Sabha constituencies. The party is now at full throttle, a well-oiled machine gearing up for the checkered flag.

It is saturation point for the party with Chief Minister Narendra Modi launching his â€˜Kesariya Yatraâ€™ on Thursday and Prime Minister Vajpayee scheduled to arrive here on Friday to canvass jointly with his deputy, LK Advani, in the latterâ€™s constituency of Gandhinagar.

The BJPâ€™s campaign headquarters in Khanpur is buzzing with activity with teams chalking out details of VVIP visits, sending out campaign material and using high-end technology to reach out to the voters.

Everyone seems to know what he or she is supposed to do. Even Vajpayeeâ€™s recorded message â€” which begins with ""Namaskaar, main Atal Bihari Vajpayee bol raha hun"" â€” has been sent to lakhs of voters who got to listen to the prime minister over the phone for the first time.

As a part of its campaigning, the BJP has tried to muster support from the influential Patel community by organising community functions in almost every district of Saurashtra. Similarly, big meetings of Dalits were held in Dhandhuka, Surendranagar and Jamnagar constituencies. Throughout the campaign, the BJP has made a big show of Congress workers, including Muslims, switching over to its side. These publicised crossovers have demoralised the Opposition much before the polling day.

The BJP has geographically charted out the campaign very well and its control room is exactly aware of the movements of the campaigners. Star campaigners and Union ministers Arun Jaitley and Sushma Swaraj toured the state intensively on Thursday. While Jaitley addressed meetings in Nadiad and Ahmedabad, Swaraj was in Saurashtra.

Well-known Gujarati film star Naresh Kanodia is a huge hit with rural voters. Advani has also arrived here after his Bharat Uday Yatra and was addressing meetings in the Shahpur area of Ahmedabad which falls in his constituency.

Former chief minister Keshubhai Patel is concentrating on Patel-dominated constituencies in North Gujarat and Saurashtra and has launched his own â€˜Bharat Swabhiman Jagran Yatraâ€™. Filmstar-turned-politicians Vinod Khanna, Hema Malini and Poonam Dhillon are also drawing crowds, as is Apara Mehta of â€˜Kyunki...â€™ fame.

6,Mahila Cong protests stampede,"PATNA: The women''s wing of the state Congress, Mahila Congress, organised protest day on Thursday throughout the state to condemn birthday celebration of UP BJP leader in Lucknow, Lalji Tandon that ended in the killing of 24 people on Monday.

Incidentally, Prime Minister Vajpayee, who represents Lucknow in Parliament, filed his nomination papers for the seat on Thursday. Mahila Congress observed Thursday as protest day against the incident. The protest meeting was held here at the party headquarters, Sadaquat Ashram.

Former Union minister Usha Sinha, who heads the Mahila Congress, said that the function held in Lucknow was aimed to benefit Vajpayee. She also said that distribution of saris among poor women was violation of the code of conduct. She added that the incident was an insult to the country.

According to her, the way Vajpayee has been trying to cover up the incident showed that he had faith neither in the code of conduct, nor in the administration, and nor did he seem to be sensitive towards women.

The venue had BJP posters and banners on a huge scale, while the saris were being distributed by Tandon, she said, adding that it showed that the function was of BJP. Vajpayee has been indulging in double speak, when he says that it was not BJP''s function, she said.

7,NCC official sore at govt apathy,"PATNA: National Cadet Corps (NCC) director general Lt Gen B K Bopanna has said that the NCCâ€™s bid of creating a human resource of organised, trained and motivated youths for the service of nation has been adversely hit in Bihar because of the apathy of the state government.

Lt Gen Bopanna told media persons the NCC directorate was certainly not happy with the way the state government was releasing funds for NCC activities in the state.

Only 40 per cent of the sanctioned amount was released during the financial year 2003-04 as a result of which the NCC could not pursue its training and other activities properly.

Bopanna said 40,000 cadets have been enrolled in different wings of NCC in Bihar for whose training a sum of Rs 2.6 crore was required. But the government could sanction only Rs 1.03 crore. As a result, the stateâ€™s children missed out many opportunities which the NCC provides. Similar is the situation in Jharkhand, he added.

On the other hand, children of states like Karnataka and Assam have been benefited the most because of the good support provided to the NCC by the governments.

8,"It's election time: ABCD chhodo, neta se nata jodo","PATNA: Some are young. Some others are not so young. Come elections, and they are the â€œmost wantedâ€� lot. Of course, by political parties. For, they serve as hulla brigade, cast bogus votes, capture booths and even intimidate people to ensure their partiesâ€™ win. And is it for free? â€œMay be. May not be,â€� some confide in hushed tones. One thing is sure, though: That caste affiliation plays a big role. After all, boysâ€™ hostels in Patna are divided on caste lines.

While a student from Saidpur hostels, a stronghold of Bhumihars, has affinity with BJP candidate C P Thakur, Patel Chhatrawas, having Kurmi students, is said to be soft on JD(U). Similarly, other hostels, too, have their own favourites.

Munna Bhai Patel, an inmate of Patel Chhatrawas, said: â€œWe have already been approached by Ram Kripal Yadav, C P Thakur and Ranjan Yadav. But we are fed up with politicians. We will only support the candidate with whom we have a personal relationship,â€� he said. The hostel is 250-strong, but these days only a fistful could be seen. All of them are said to be busy in election works.

PG Hostel of Patna University has posters of Rabri Devi and Laloo Yadav all over the place.

â€œAlmost 80 per cent of the inmates are devoted to RJD and we can go to any extent for Laloo Yadav,â€� said Pankaj Yadav, an inmate who is also an RJD worker. He claimed that the entire Ranighat campus, comprising, besides PG and Hathwa Hostel of Old and New Law College, Sir CV Raman, Ramanujan, Ansari, Iqbal, Minto and Jackson hostels, have strong affiliation to RJD.

Nitish Kumar of PG Hostel said students take out cycle rallies and hold â€œnukkad sabhasâ€� in favour of RJD. â€œWe have direct access to Laloo. He listens to our problems. Other candidates are beyond our reach,â€� he said. Anil Tiwari, another hosteller, said RJD has given them a new toilet and a hand pump in return for the services.

â€œWe participate in foot march and also do door-to-door campaigning,â€� said Raj Kumar Yadav of New Law College Hostel.

â€œThey (political parties) not only ask us to capture booths but also ask us to cast bogus votes. As a majority of us belong to forward castes, the ruling party tries to create problems for us. About 10 inmates have been framed in attempt to murder cases as elections are round the corner. Police also harass us,â€� said Ajit Prakash, a student of B N College.

â€œThe ruling party wants us to vacate this hostel. They associate us with Ranveer Sena just because we are Bhumihars,â€� said Ashutosh Kumar, NSUI president of PU, who resides in Saidpur hostels.

â€œWe will do whatever the party we support asks for, except murder,â€� said Bunty Chaurasia, who lives in Chaurasia Bhavan where only students belonging to Chaurasia community stay.

â€œPappu Yadav is a regular visitor here and Ram Kripal and Sushil Kumar Modi come occasionally. In our hostel, we mainly have RJD supporters. Most of the students fail to understand that politicians use us for their gain. Students get trapped thinking that they will become MLAs and MPs,â€� said Manoj Kumar Rai of Hathwa Hostel.

9,Congress pinch: Vajpayee scared,"NEW DELHI: The Prime Minister's request for withdrawal of Ram Jethmalani's candidature was on Thursday termed by the Congress as an attempt to buy the latter's silence. It alleged that the PM was ""scared"" of Jethmalani. Party spokesman Kapil Sibal said Jethmalani would not withdraw from the fray and the Congress had fielded an alternate candidate only to ensure a contest in case Jethmalani was unable to return from London, where his son has been taken on a medical emergency. Sibal alleged, ""Jethmalani has been Vajpayee's friend for long and has served under him in the government. So, Jethmalani may have revealed a few of the secrets he shares with Vajpayee. There was a great amount of pressure on Jethmalani not to contest. Vajpayee has something to hide.""

10,NDA to enact law on foreign origin issue: PM,"RAIPUR: Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee on Friday said if voted back to power, the NDA would enact a law to bar persons of foreign origin from occupying top constitutional posts.

""If we will get a majority, we will formulate a law on the foreign origin issue,"" Vajpayee told reporters at Mana airport here before leaving for Ahmedabad.

Asked if foreign origin has any relevance when development is being projected as the main issue in the elections, he said who should become the Prime Minister or the President is also an important question.

Asked whether legal luminary Ram Jethmalani has reciprocated his call to withdraw from contest against him. Vajpayee just laughed off the question.

He said he felt sorry that the son of Jethmalani is not well for which he had to leave for London.

12,"Cong-led alliance lacks principles, ideology: BJP","NEW DELHI: Claiming that NCP Chief Sharad Pawar''s reported statement opposing people of foreign origin occupying high offices showed the ""divisions"" within the Cong-led alliance, BJP on Friday said the anti-NDA grouping was ""not based on any principle or ideology"".

""From Pawar''s statement in Nasik on Thursday that he would support any constitutional amendment, moved by BJP, barring people of foreign origin from occupying high posts, it is clear that the alliance between Congress and friendly parties is not based on ideology or principles,"" Union Law Minister and party spokesman Arun Jaitley told reporters here.

He said though only four days were left for the first phase of Lok Sabha polls, Congress and its allies were yet to come out with a common minimum programme.""

""Sonia Gandhi had said at the time of releasing the Congress manifesto that the alliance may come out with a common programme but the absence of any such documents show that they are pulling in different directions,"" he said.

Citing three examples of ""differences"" among the Congress and its allies, the BJP leader said in Jammu and Kashmir Congress and PDP had ""fundamental differences"" over the Bill, which sought to deprive women of their state subject status if they married outside the state.

""In Bihar, there are sharp differences between the Congress and the RJD on the issue of providing 33 per cent reservations to women in Parliament and state legislatures while Pawar''s statement makes clear the fundamental differences between the two parties,"" he said.

13,"Young & swanky, they’re out to fight 'politics of hate'","AHMEDABAD: The sight of greying politicians standing atop a customised â€˜rathâ€™ has stopped being a crowd-puller. But a group of young social workers campaigning from their swanky Qualis car continues to attract eyeballs.

Mahendra Singh and his team of the Studentsâ€™ Action Committee are in Gujarat to propagate against what they call ""the politics of hate"". For this reason, they have launched a â€˜Rashtriya Dharma Nirpeksh Abhiyanâ€™ (national secular movement).

""Our members have already begun work in Gujarat, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra, where we have been working with the tribals since 1997. The agenda during polls, is to expose the BJP government, which has not done anything to resolve the livelihood issues of voters. Instead it has been successful in communalising the society,"" says 28-year-old Singh.

During their tour in various parts of Ahmedabad, Gandhinagar, Kapadvanj and Sabarkantha, the teamâ€™s modus operandi has been to talk of the failure of the BJP government by means of street-theatre, songs, rallies and contact programmes.

""We perform two 20-minute plays â€” â€˜Feel Good Rajaâ€™ and â€˜Baat baat me baatâ€™ â€” at various tribal hamlets. The plays are political satires that help energising our campaigns and countering the BJPâ€™s ideology,"" says another team member, Vivek Sharma. Sharma is just 22, and he is a full-time worker in the committee.

""We are trying to raise the issues of people in villages where we perform theatre. As our team consists of young members, the young voters relate to us easily. At several places, they also join our campaign,"" he says.

Singhâ€™s team, which is largely young (all of them under 30 years of age), has a contemporary style of functioning. ""We move around in the constituencies in our car, which is fully-equipped with lap-tops, printers, fax machine and photo-copier. This way, we can work in the remote pockets without being totally cut-off from the town,"" Singh explains. The committee has a membership of about 1,000 volunteers, who are working in various tribal regions of the country.

""We set up the committee in 1997, to work towards the uplift of tribals and Dalits. But after the post-Godhra riots, we realised that the BJP was also trying to saffronise the tribals. It was then we launched this campaign. We believe that only with an increased presence of secular forces can we halt this growth of rightist forces,"" he says.

Ganesh Uge, another 28-year-old team member says, ""It is a thrill to be working with a young team which has a secular agenda.We are confident of spreading our network to other states too.""

The team is also working toward creating awareness about use of Electronic Voting Machines (EVM) and dispelling myths about the machine by means of posters and simulating the voting process for villagers, he says.

14,Tribals' migration worries political parties,"VADODARA: They can be seen queuing up at railway stations and bus terminals with their luggage. Itâ€™s that time of the year when tribals of Dahod move lock, stock and barrel to distant places for work.

However, this time around they carry something more crucial than luggage---votes that matter to political parties. And it has become a thing of concern for politicians as polling is expected to go low.

Those following this trend for years point out that no amount of convincing can stop tribals from moving out to make a living. The region has a few irrigation facility and a soil not conducive to extensive cultivation apart from little industrial development.

Neeta Hatkar, who works in the district for a non-government organisation called Anandi, says: ""Tribals stay out of the district for five or six months. The migration begins after Diwali when Makai crop is harvested. They take up work in construction projects and also as agriculture labourers in other parts of the state.""

Tribals return for sometime during Holi which coincides with the marriage season. About 35 per cent tribals migrate again after Holi, says Rajendra Jaiswal of the Prakruti Foundation.

Political parties in Dahod admit that this trend is likely to have a bearing on the coming polls. Says district Congress committee president Bijalbhai Damor: ""Migration would definitely lead to a fall in the polling percentage.We would look into the effect of a low turnout.""

""Itâ€™s not possible to curb the trend as it has been going on for years. It is a question of survival for those who go out for work. They have to earn their daily bread and nothing can stop them from doing so,"" he adds.

BJP district unit president Bachubhai Khabad says that migration would affect the turnout. ""It is a permanent feature here. All parties get affected. It is wrong to say that a particular party would suffer more,"" he adds.

15,"Despite Narmada canal, these farmers buy water","SANKHEDA (Vadodara): ""Gharno chhokro ghanti chate, Upadhya ne atto, (Even if there is nothing at home to eat, one still believes in giving alms),"" quips Vikramsinh Thakore, who lives at a stoneâ€™s throw from a branch canal of the Sardar Sarovar Project, in Bariapura village of Sankheda taluka. He is right because although he sees the canal transporting water to various parts of the state, he cannot even draw a drop for himself.

Itâ€™s the same story in 42 villages in the region, which have a higher topography and its difficult to reach water. As a result the farmers have to buy water from a rich farmerâ€™s borewell.

""There are no minor canals on our side and besides I do not have the money to buy a pump. I have to buy water from a Patel who charges Rs 35 per bhigha for an hour,"" says Thakore, whose cotton fields are only 700 metres from the canal.

""I wonder what the hype around the Narmada is all about. Both the BJP and the Congress during their rule spoke volumes but we are yet to see the results,"" he says.

However, a senior Sardar Sarovar Nigam Limited (SSNL) engineer says these villages are situated in the ""non-command area"" side of the branch canal. Being on a higher topographic plane than the branch canal, these villages which include Chikhodra, Kosindra, Vasna, Vatpur, Malpur, Vadeli, Malo, Modhrul, Amalpur, Gundecha and Aretha have to depend on bore-wells.

Also, 25-odd main branches which pass through Vadodara, Bharuch and Chotta Udepur are mostly shut during peak summer as the network is not designed to water fields during this time. So growing waterintensive cash crops during the Kharif season is not advisable. The water, which flows through some of the main branches, is mainly for industrial and drinking purposes and therefore cannot be diverted for farming.

""There are around 72 Narmada settlements in Chotta Udepur, most of them from Madhya Pradesh. They are the fortunate ones as their fields are adjoining the canal. I grew cotton this year thinking that the minors will be here soon. But SSNL engineers told me that the minors will take some time as my field is situated on a higher topography."" says another farmer from Hareshwar Tadvi.

""I had approached both the BJP and the Congress candidates with this problem but they could not do anything. I donâ€™t want them again. They come with the same empty promises,"" adds Tadvi.

A recent SSNL report says 2,417 kilometres of minor canals are yet to be built between Bharuch and Vadodara. For an efficient penetration, the region should have at least 4,500-km-long minors for the command area alone. This is only possible if the 272-km-long distributaries are in place to feed these minors.

16,PMT paper leak: Ghaziabad school owner arrested,"NEW DELHI: An owner of a school in Ghaziabad has been arrested by Delhi Police for his alleged involvement in the CBSE-PMT paper leak on Friday.

According to the police, Kuldeep Tyagi was one of the main associates of Ranjeet Verma, the main accused in the case.

The two accused in the case who were arrested earlier, Vikas Verma and Rakesh Verma, have revealed to the police that the question paper was solved in Tyagiâ€™s Ghaziabad home. â€˜â€˜Tyagi and Ranjeet studied in the same school in Shakarpur. Tyagi knew all along about the activities of Ranjeet,â€™â€™ said deputy commissioner of police (crime) Dependra Pathak.

The police are now also looking for the two men who solved the question paper in Tyagiâ€™s home. These two men had come to Tyagiâ€™s place along with Ranjeet a few days before the police arrested Vikas and Rakesh. According to sources, they are teachers in the same institute whose staff is being questioned for alleged complicity in the paper leak.

â€˜â€˜There are reports that these two were teaching in the same institute. We will question the owner of the institute soon,â€™â€™ said a police officer who is investigating the case.

Tyagi has apparently revealed to the police that Ranjeet managed to secure a seat for himself in a medical college at Nagpur even though he was a student of commerce in class 12. The police had earlier said that Ranjeet had managed his admission to the medical college through one of his contacts in Bihar. The police have sent teams to Jaipur, Nagpur and Bihar to trace Ranjeet.

The police said that Vikas and Rakesh led them to Tyagiâ€™s home in Ghaziabad. Tyagi admitted to the police that Ranjeet had taken shelter in his home after he came to know about the raid in New Ashok Nagar in which the two other accused were arrested.

Meanwhile, the role of the Delhi government official, who is said to be closely associated with the accused, is getting murkier. The official is said to be close to a few criminals currently lodged in Tihar jail. â€˜â€˜His role in the paper leak is not confirmed, but he seems to have a shady past. He is being questioned,â€™â€™ said a senior police officer. The official had earlier tried to help Vikas and Rakesh in securing bail.
