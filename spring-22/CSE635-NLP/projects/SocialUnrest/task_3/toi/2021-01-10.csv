0,Punjab govt caught in controversial foodgrain deal,"CHANDIGARH: Punjab government is caught in the midst of a controversial foodgrain sale deal in which grains unfit for human consumption are being sold in the open market to traders.

The proposed deal involves roughly four lakh tonnes of wheat that has been rejected by the Food Corporation of India (FCI) as being below acceptable norms. The controversy hinges around the quality of the wheat, as this stock will be processed into flour. The quality of these grains is said to be below the Prevention of Food Adulteration (PFA) Act norms.

Under PFA norms the quantity of damaged and broken grains should not exceed four to five per cent. In this case the quantity of such grains at time is more than eight per cent, sources said.

Interestingly so far the quality of the grains, some as old as the 1997 crop season, has not been assessed so far. The stocks in question are lying in the godowns of different procurement agencies in the state.

While the officer in charge of storage and movement of grains has written that as quality of the wheat is poor the deal should not take place, others in the department feel the traders lobby is behind such pressure tactics to reduce the reserve price of the grains to garner benefits that are not due to them.

When the process for formulating the deal was on, the then director of the department had asked this officer that he either ""softpedal"" his concerns or not write them at all as it would create ""complications"" in the process later, sources said.

The normal procedure in such deals is to auction the grains based on their quality. In case they are not fit for human consumption the procedure is to call tenders and dispose them via this route. The latter route opens chances for collusion with officials and results in lowering of price and consequent benefits to the buyer.

Persons involved in the trade say the danger is not of outright sale of unfit grains directly to consumers by these traders but one of blending very poor quality grains with fresh grains and then selling them to flour mills. In the process unfit wheat flour is passed on to consumers.

""We plan to segregate the grains according to their quality to ensure that only those grains that meet PFA norms are sold by the auction process. In any case the sale will be on as is where is basis and therefore there are no chances of any foul play,"" director food and supplies, V K Singh, said.

1,Alberta minister all praise for Punjabi culture,"LUDHIANA: Punjab Pollution Control chairman Rana KP Singh, on Saturday, felicitated seven eminent personalities with gold medals for their contribution to public life at the Lohri Mela organised by Malwa Sabhycharak Manch at Punjabi Bhawan here.

Noted Punjabi poet Surjit Pattar, hockey Olympian Deepak Thakur, educationist Manjit Kaur Sodhia, bureaucrat Raminder Singh, former IAS officer Gokal Patnaik and music composer Tejwant Kittu were among those honoured.

The community development minister Alberta Province, Canada, who was the special guest, in his address, said he was happy to attend a Mela in Punjab for the first time. He pointed out that Punjabis dominated whichever part of the world they migrated due to their rich and vibrant culture.

Popular singer Gursewak Mann and a number of other folk artistes enthralled the packed Punjabi Bhawan stage. The organisers distributed traditional Lohri fare. The healthy child and turbantying competitions attracted a number of participants.

2,Younger Gandhis: Will or will they not join politics?,"NEW DELHI: Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Friday refused to answer for the umpteenth time media queries if her children, Priyanka Vadra and Rahul Gandhi, would join the party or contest the Lok Sabha elections.

However, going by the persistent clamour among the party leaders and workers alike, and an assessment credited to those close to her, this may be the right time to induct the younger Gandhis.

In all probability, Priyanka and Rahul may be drafted for campaign and perhaps, also fielded in the Lok Sabha polls.

There has been an old proposal that they should contest from constituencies close to Amethi, or those placed strategically across Uttar Pradesh, to ensure victories. Alternatively, they could be fielded from different states to coordinate the campaign effectively.

Both Priyanka and Rahul had campaigned during the last general election. Subsequently, Priyanka has been working in Amethi on behalf of her mother.

But nobody in the party is talking since Sonia herself has repeatedly said that it was for her children to decide. Senior leader Pranab Mukherjee, pressed for answer, far from being amused, found the question â€˜funny.''

The party wants to spring a surprise on the eve of the polls, and Congressmen argue that this element is essential to its strategic planning.

Outside the Congress, political analysts have suggested that the younger Gandhis should have made up their mind long ago. If they decided to take the plunge, go through the mill as social workers before taking the political course, perhaps with elections not around. That would make their entry in public life credible.

3,"Mum says no to marriage, youth commits suicide","HYDERABAD: A 22-year-old man reportedly committed suicide by jumping into a well at Engine Bowli on the Osmania University campus, following his mother''s refusal to perform his marriage.

The Osmania University police, fished out his body from the well on Saturday.

The deceased has been identified as Mohammed Wahed Khan, an autorickshaw driver and a resident of Chilkalguda, the Osmania University police said.

Police said that Wahed left his house last Wednesday saying that he was going out on some work but never returned.

All the efforts of Wahed''s mother Fathima Begum to locate him went in vain, though she inquired about him at his relatives house.

His body was later found in a well, police said.

Police said that Fathima Begum had told her son to first save some money for the marriage and only after that she will perform the wedding.

But he was adamant on getting married at the earliest.

The police shifted the body to the Gandhi Hospital for a post-mortem.

4,"Eye on polls, BJP set to take feel-good message to masses","HYDERABAD: The BJP will try and sharpen its ""feel-good"" message, while finalising its poll strategy for the parliamentary elections most likely in April, at its crucial national executive meeting, starting here on Sunday at Kushabhau Thakrenagar.

Sources said a 20-30 point Action Plan will be issued on Monday.

Party president M Venkaiah Naidu''s opening speech on Sunday will spell out the BJP''s ""line of action"" for the elections.

The national executive â€” in line with the NDA â€” will authorise the Prime Minister to decide the dates of the polls.

A formal announcement on the elections will come after the Cabinet meets later next week.

A public rally at Hyderabad''s Parade Grounds on Sunday evening addressed by Prime Minister Vajpayee will, in a way, kick off the BJP''s election campaign.

Though key NDA ally, TDP chief and Andhra Pradesh caretaker chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu will not be at the rally, sources said he is likely to invite the entire BJP national executive to dinner on Monday.

On Saturday, at a meeting of general secretaries here, held to finetune the agenda for the executive and finalise the drafts of the mandatory political and economic resolutions, it was decided to have a separate resolution on the PM''s recent successful trip to Islamabad.

There will be a greater level of informal interaction between the BJP leaders and the media, party sources said. It won''t be limited to party functionaries but will also include Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani and finance minister Jaswant Singh.

If the running theme of all the three resolutions will be the feel-good factor, the political resolution will focus on the current political situation, compare the BJP''s readiness to face elections with the disarray in the Opposition ranks, underline the stability of the NDA government, and point out that while the NDA has a ""tried and tested"" leader in Vajpayee, the Opposition has yet to choose its leader.

The economic resolution will stress that the 8.4 per cent GDP growth rate, BSE sensex closing at more than 6,000 points, foreign exchange reserves touching $100 billion reflect a booming economy created by the performance of the government, which includes an emphasis on improving infrastructure. Jaswant Singh''s mini-budget announcements will also be mentioned.

To counter Opposition criticism â€” that the announcements are aimed largely at the BJP''s middle class constituency â€” it will highlight the social safety net announced earlier this week for the unorganised sector and the progress on the kisan credit cards.

The fact that the announcements were entirely election- related was underlined when Venkaiah Naidu said he had told Jaswant Singh at Thursday''s meeting of top

BJP leaders that he should do something for the manufacturing and small scale sectors, lower salaried employees and farmers â€” Friday''s announcements took care of this.

With elections now likely in April-May, party sources say it may not be possible to have detailed pre-poll surveys as was done in Rajasthan recently, as 100 days were required to conduct the survey and another 100 to act on the finding.

However, what is being planned is a quick survey to judge the state of the 182 seats the BJP currently holds.

Party general-secretary Pramod Mahajan is likely to make a powerpoint presentation on the ""situation on the ground"" and categorise seats as falling into A, B and C categories, depending on winnability.

5,Draft paper on parking urges changes in Pune's DC rules,"PUNE: A draft policy to ease traffic congestion in the city has called for several modifications in the Pune municipal corporation''s (PMC) development control (DC) rules.

A ban on new schools and colleges in congested areas, compulsory registration for coaching classes, cancellation of licences to restaurants using parking lots for business activities and permission to private property owners to use vacant plots for public parking are among the highlights of the draft policy for ""vehicular parking"" in Pune city.

An expert committee, comprising PMC officials and traffic planners, headed by city engineer Prashant Waghmare, has forwarded the draft to commissioner Sanjay Kumar.

Once the civic body ratifies the proposals, the policy will come into effect, highly-placed sources told TNN.

Kumar and Waghmare had taken the lead in forming the policy, in the background of the growth in the number of vehicles and the congestion caused by street parking.

In the draft, Waghmare has pointed out that the number of vehicles in Pune has crossed the 9.60 lakh-mark, and if all of them are to be parked on the road, it will require 448 hectares of land.

With 435 vehicles hitting the road every day, the problem is set to aggravate further. ""At this rate, the PMC will be required to provide 0.25 hectares of land for parking every day. The PMC''s efforts and the funds spent on widening and constructing new roads will go waste if steps are not taken to keep roads open for traffic,"" Waghmare has stated.

The committee has recommended sea changes in the existing DC rules on parking, which, according to it, has become outdated.

Schools and colleges, in any part of the city, should be allowed to use their open spaces for providing parking facilities for a fee, it has proposed. Pointing out that vehicles, mainly school auto rickshaws and parents'' vehicles, are often parked along the approach roads, the committee has decided to make it mandatory for schools to allow these vehicles to be parked inside their premises.

The PMC should make it mandatory for private coaching classes to get a registration. The owners should specify how many students they will enrol and if they cannot provide parking lot, then they should hire the ground of a nearby municipal school or an open plot.

""In no case, should students be allowed to park their vehicles on the roads,"" the committee has stated.

The draft also called upon the PMC to carry out a survey of the ""seating capacity"" of restaurants and hotels. If it exceeds permissible limits â€” leading to street parking â€” then their licences should be cancelled or a heavy fine should be imposed, it suggested.

6,"Reading between the lines, literally","BANGALORE: Dusty racks, dog-eared pages, musty leather-bound old books, magazines with pages shorn off. These are images of â€˜public librariesâ€™.

But for the 21,000 plus people who visit the 83 public libraries in Bangalore every day, these libraries are still a haven of knowledge, whatever the shortcomings.

Nearly 60 per cent of these visitors come to read newspapers and periodicals, says T. Malleshappa, director of the department of public libraries. The others are students accessing reference material and textbooks for study, or serious readers who just read.

Says Sadashivappa, a government employee at Vidhana Soudha who is a regular at the State Central Library in Cubbon Park: â€œI have a quick lunch and make use of the break to browse through papers and magazines. I canâ€™t afford to buy them at home. Neither do I have the time to read them during the rest of the day.â€�

Many may find the cataloguing messy. Byronâ€™s poetry might appear in the â€˜Cosmologyâ€™ rack. Or itâ€™s likely that the titles you are looking for are unheard of. But the fact that you can sit in some quiet and read makes a lot of difference to students. â€œHardly 15 per cent of the literate make use of libraries. The number of readers hasnâ€™t increased in proportion with literacy,â€� laments Malleshappa.

With the government keen on application of IT in all its departments, the department of public libraries does not want to be left behind. â€œWe launched a pilot project last month at the Basavangudi library to convert it into a â€˜cyberâ€™ library with affordable Internet access. We have computerised the cataloguing in three libraries and will complete all the others this year,â€� says Malleshappa. Next yearâ€™s plans include networking all the libraries.

Taking books to places where there are no libraries in the vicinity are three mobile libraries that travel to the same spots once a week. The entire picture is not really rosy though.

While books can be borrowed in many public libraries on paying a deposit of Rs 25 to Rs 40, many books are never returned because a book worth Rs 200 can easily be kept back for Rs 40 or Rs 50. â€œWe suffer losses when people donâ€™t return books. Anyone can borrow. There are no restrictions. It is very difficult to keep track because we are understaffed,â€� says Malleshappa. Nearly 2,000 books are added every year, 80 per cent of them in Kannada. The city has 65,705 borrowing members. Severe understaffing is proving to be a threat to an extent that some libraries may have to be shut down.

A 6 per cent library cess on property tax paid up by the citizenry is the only source of income â€” it amounts to around Rs 5 crore a year, while their need is nearly Rs 8 crore, says the director. Nearly 45 per cent of this money is spent on acquiring new books, 15 per cent on periodicals, 15 per cent on equipment and the remaining on maintenance. Most of the buildings housing the libraries are rented; many buildings are not in good shape and often have to be shut down to undertake repairs.

Minuses apart, the department is keen on reforms. And optimistic. Plans are on to open a hi-tech â€˜Singapore Libraryâ€™ in RPC Layout at a cost of Rs 1.5 crore.

7,Experts suggest cyber laws to curb child porn,"AHMEDABAD: Alarmed over the increasing internet penetration exposing children to pornography and paedophiles using the Net as a tool, a group of professionals â€” including police personnel, cyber law experts and NGOs working with children â€” recommended ""suggestive laws for India"" to combat the menace. They also stressed on the need to sensitise people towards the issue.

A brainstorming session on ''Child Pornography in the Indian Society'' was organised here on Friday by SnehPrayas, an NGO, Asian School of Cyber Laws and Bhartiya Vidyapith, Pune. The summit discussed various issues related to the subject and spreading awareness about this ""hidden reality"". The Internet Service Providers'' (ISP) Association of Gujarat, Cyber-Cafe Association of Ahmedabad and representatives of Ahmedabad Police also attended.

""The world has opened up with the advent of internet. As children are most susceptible under this medium, we need to acknowledge this menace in our country before it spreads its tentacles. Thus, this gathering is a step towards alleviating this problem even before it starts,"" said additional commissioner of police Keshav Kumar.

As a step towards avoiding such incidents in the city, the cyber cafe association of Ahmedabad has already been regulated in co-operation with the Ahmedabad Police. Every cafe is required to register the details of each customer. ""The model followed by Gujarat''s ISPs as well as cyber cafes will be an inspiration for other states where there is a pressing need to regulate such cafes, especially in metros where there have actually been a few cases of child pornography,"" a Pune-based legal expert said.

However, Indian legislation does not provide any law concerning child pornography. The maximum punishment one faces under IPC for sexual abuse is 10 years.

8,Party animals could bare their beastly instincts,"AHMEDABAD: The suicide of a 24-year-old girl on Wednesday, after being gang-raped by her lover and his friends on the New Year eve, has sent shock waves among the citizens across the state. But this is not the first time that a girl has unsuspectingly fallen prey to the carnal instincts of men she had come to trust completely.

Crime records here are replete with cases where girls walked into the traps laid by their lovers only to meet fatal ends. Women rights groups, in fact, say that a lot of fun parties end in such incidents which are never reported out of shame, and even this incident would have gone unnoticed, but for the fact that the rape victim went on to commit suicide.

Experts caution that the words of Rich Gosse, an American expert on flirting, should be remembered as he says ""when a woman talks to a man, she is thinking about her future, when a man is talking to a woman, he is thinking about tonight"". But even when one is not partying and getting into serious relationships, the pitfalls are plenty.

Take the case of Nidhi Shah (24) who was into a web-designing course after graduation and betrothed to a Mumbai-based stock-advisor Puneet Sancheti in February 2000. On April 16, she disappeared after her class.

Twelve days later, her body, in a semi-decomposed state, bearing strangulation marks was found near Thane in Maharashtra. The Maharashtra police, who were investigating the case, have no clue yet as to what led to this grotesque end of this middle-class girl from Ahmedabad''s posh Law Garden locality.

Nidhi, described as an introvert with a quiet disposition, was engaged to Puneet Sancheti, but was said to be ''depressed'' after the engagement. From the investigations so far, she took a bus for Maharashtra and alighted at Malad, two days after she went missing. Last she was spotted, with a ''longhaired'' boy, close to where she was found dead.

On January 10, 2001, five members of a middle-class business family in Ahmedabad committed suicide by consuming poison. One among them was 20-year old Hetal who had married her lover Raj Jain and was ''forced'' to divorce him later. Raj was arrested for ""abetting the suicide of the Gandhis"", but the police could never get to the bottom of what had exactly gone wrong. Raj was later granted bail because the police failed to file the chargesheet in the stipulated period.

Psychiatrists say that these cases are just a tip of the iceberg. ""For each such case that catches the public eye due to its tragic end, there are innumerable cases of girls getting exploited by boys under the guise of love. Ours is a free society, but it is high time that the girls sharpened their skills in judging the credibility of the person they are falling for. All cases may not end in suicide or murder but more and more girls are getting scarred for life, falling prey to such phoney lovers,"" says Dr Ratna Bilwani.

""With such cases on the rise, it has become imperative that girls realise the risks of getting abused in love relationships, and should never let their guard down,"" says Dr Hansal Bhachech.

9,BKS out to ground Modi's kite party,"GANDHINAGAR: The Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS) has decided to spoil Chief Minister Narendra Modi''s party at the forthcoming kite festival, trumpeted as the â€˜Vishwa Gujarat Parivaar Mahotsav'', commencing here on Monday.

A Sangh Parivar outfit, the BKS, which is on the warpath over the power tariff issue especially after Modi evicted them from their government accommodation in Gandhinagar, has decided to disturb the three-day kite-flying festivities, which will be attended by Prime Minister Vajpayee on Tuesday.

A BKS press release, issued after a two-day representatives'' meet at Pirana under the chairmanship of BKS national president Kunvarji Jadav, said it was unanimously decided to come up with ""surprise programmes"". ""The main aim would be to embarrass Modi in front Vajpayee,"" a BKS spokesperson said here on Saturday.

""We are going to ask the PM a straightforward question â€” do you want farmers or Modi? We are going to make an open statement to this effect before the PM when he is in Ahmedabad,"" the BKS leader said.

The BKS meet also decided to disturb a meeting to be organised in Bhuj for the inauguration by the PM of the reconstructed GK General Hospital on Tuesday. ""We will not disturb Vajpayee.

However,we will certainly not let Modi utter one word. Thousands of Kisans from Saurashtra and Kutch are planning to reach Kutch on that occasion,"" the spokesperson said.

The BKS meet also decided to boycott Modi and four of his ministers â€” IK Jadeja, Anandiben Patel, Amit Shah and Saurabh Patel.

10,CM blasts Kanpur party unit for poor poll show,"KANPUR: The Samajwadi Party sammelan began at the Circuit House here on Saturday, with chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav blasting party workers for failing to perform well in the assembly elections as well as Lok Sabha polls in the city.

Addressing the sammelan, Yadav said, ""The results clearly reveal that there is no coordination among city party workers.""

Announcing that the party would not enter into any new alliances in the next Lok Sabha elections, he said party workers would be directly responsible for the results.

Yadav dropped a hint to party workers to start preparations for the Lok Sabha elections and at the same time warned them of stern action if results were not in the party''s favour.

The city unit of the party was on the receiving end, but the CM appreciated the performance of party workers of Kanpur Dehat. Yadav remarked, ""More than verbal assurance, the party needed ground level workers.""

Concerned over the formation of small groups within the city unit of the party, Yadav gave Harbansh Singh Bhalla the charge of uniting the factions.

Expressing displeasure at the fact that the city Lok Sabha seat had always eluded the party, Yadav called it top priority for the party to keep a tab on the political developments here.

Yadav said that tall claims made by city leaders had failed to impress him as there had been a consistent down swing in the party vote-bank.

Saying that the results of the next Lok Sabha elections would decide the performance of the state government, he asked the party members not to let the golden opportunity pass by.

""The struggle of party members against the Bahujan Samaj Party will be remembered in history,"" added the CM. He appealed to SP workers to take the party to a national status and for the purpose sought arduous efforts from them.

Yadav remarked that party aimed to break the shackles and emerge as one of the leading national parties. He said, ""The next Lok Sabha elections will prove my statement correct.""

Explaining the strained centre-state government relations, he said that it was an old practice.

""Union government is always wary of the UP government as the state gives the maximum number of parliamentarians. But Samajwadi Party is determined not to give any chance to the central government,"" added the chief minister.

Yadav said that the recent assembly by-polls and legislative council elections revealed that people were looking up to the party.

The chief minister announced the starting of the farmers'' pension scheme and 10 villagers were given their long pending pension on the occasion. More than 27,000 farmers would benefit from the pension policy.

Reminding party workers of his assurance to remove unemployment, the chief minister said that either jobs would be created or allowances doled out to unemployed persons soon.

12,BMC officer arrested for taking bribe,"MUMBAI: The Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) arrested Arun Dhumale, an assistant law officer of the BMC, on charges of accepting a bribe of Rs 5,000 from a person outside the sessions court on Friday evening.

This is the second incident of a law officer from the civic corporation being arrested for corruption.

Recently, deputy law officer Rashida Rehman was arrested by the ACB for allegedly accepting Rs 1 lakh as a bribe in a coffee shop behind the BMC headquarters.

In Dhumale''s case, ACB officials said he allegedly demanded the bribe from Jeevan Vijay, a Chembur resident, for getting a stay order vacated.

They said Mr Vijay had complained to the ward office at Chembur against illegal construction in the Lal Dongar area.

13,Shiv Sena chief blasts DF govt for 'corrupt' rule,"MUMBAI: Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray on Friday said that he was ready to ""leap like a tiger"" into electioneering.

Mr Thackeray''s anouncement, which he made at a party meeting, subsequently converted into a pre-poll PR exercise, has set at rest speculation about the Sena chief''s health, say party watchers.

Mr Thackeray''s rare public appearances have for some time been the cause of concern for Shiv Sainiks across the state.

For the Sena, Mr Thackeray, who will turn 77 on January 23, is the biggest vote-gatherer, thanks to his razor-sharp humour and pithy observations about politics. ""Before Balasaheb, Laloo Prasad Yadav pales into insignificance,"" said a Sena activist.

Mr Thackeray, who addressed Shiv Sainiks of the Mumbai north-central district (which is Lok Sabha speaker Manohar Joshi''s parliamentary constituency), looked cheerful and alert.

He joked with publisherastrologer Jayantrao Salgaonkar and party colleague Sudhir Joshi. Indian cricket veteran Madhav Mantri got a hug from the Sena chief, who recalled how, in the early 1950s, the two would take a train to Churchgate from Dadar at 9.58 a.m. sharp.

Back to basics. Mr Thackeray came down heavily on the Congress-led DF government in the state for its ""inept and corrupt rule"" and spoke of the need to save Mumbai from further decline.

""Abdul Karim Telgi is the DF government''s gift to the people of Maharashtra, while the Sena-BJP regime gave us fly-overs,"" he said.

Interestingly, not a word from him on the BJP''s stillborn proposal for a Sena-BJP-NCP alliance in the state.

""We have stated very clearly that we are not opposed to those north Indians who have made Mumbai their home before 1995. But these Mumbaikars should now persuade their brethren not to keep pouring into Mumbai,"" Mr Thackeray said, adding, ""I called up chief minister Sushilkumar Shinde and told him not to extend the cut-off date, for regularising illegal shanties in the metropolis, to 2000.""

""We don''t want Mumbai to be buried under the sea. After all, Mumbai is an island. It is bursting at the seams,"" he said.

Mr Thackeray felicitated Mr Manohar Joshi and described him as the Sena''s Dale Carnegie. ""Mr Joshi should now write a tome on how to win elections,"" he remarked.

The list of those toasted included a Catholic priest, a Jain philanthropist, a Muslim social worker, a neo-Buddhist activist, a Hindi-speaking vegetable merchant and an Oriya student.

Mr Mantri and Mr Salgaonkar could be trusted to lend the ''aamcha'' air to the ceremony.

15,'Jaish planning suicide attacks in Jammu',"JAMMU: The Border Security Force has intercepted messages from commanders of banned terrorist outfit Jaish-e-Mohmmad asking its cadres to carry out suicide attacks in Jammu ahead of Republic Day, top intelligence sources said here.

As per the intelligence inputs, 9 to 12 militants of ''fidayeen (suicide) squads have entered Jammu, the winter capital of the state, during past fortnight and most of them belong to JeM and Lashker-e-Taiba (LeT).

The JeM''s plans were revealed by the intercept between deputy chief of the JeM in Kashmir Valley and another commander in Pir Panchal sector which was recorded by the BSF in Srinagar on January 7, sources said.

Following the threats, security has been upgraded at 21 sensitive installations including VVIP residences and offices, Army camps, migrant shelters, railway stations and airport, which could be targeted by the militants.

16,NLFT faction willing for talks with govt,"AGARTALA: One of the major factions of the National Liberation Front of Tripura, the NLFT Nayanbasi group, has sent a letter to the state government to start dialogue to surrender arms and come overground.

Additional Director General of Police (ADG) Pranoy Sahaya said on Sunday that the state home department received the letter from Nayanbasi Jamatiya, chief of that group, Saturday in which he expressed desire to participate in peace talks and then come overground.

The talks are likely to begin soon but the modalities are yet to be finalised, Sahaya said.

According to assessment of police the NLFT (Nayanbasi group) has about 150 active cadres and 50 collaborators and about 50 sophisticated weapons in its possession.

To a question, Sahaya said the insurgent group, having camps in Bangladesh, might have come under pressure which prompted them to negotiate for surrender.

Tripura Chief Minister, Manik Sarkar and Governor Dinesh Nandan Sahaya had repeatedly appealed to the insurgents to shun the path of violence and come overground for building a developed Tripura.

Sarkar also promised on several occasions that for the sake of peace in the state, free passage would be given to the insurgents if they wanted to talk to the Centre bypassing the state government.

The other major faction of the outfit is the NLFT (Biswamohan group). Both the factions had been involved in insurgent activities.

17,Sukh Ram hopes to win more seats in polls,"SHIMLA: With Lok Sabha elections apparently round the corner, a badly battered and bruised Sukh Ram is now hoping that things may look up for his Himachal Vikas Congress (HVC), which could win just one seat in the last Vidhan Sabha elections in the state, with only the former union telecom minister winning from the Mandi Sadar assembly segment.

Sukh Ram, who did not think twice to blow his own trumpet, when the HVC made its presence felt in the 1998 Vidhan Sabha elections in the state and was instrumental in keeping the Congress out of power by giving support to the BJP in a hung assembly, and also had a member in the Rajya Sabha and the Lok Sabha, ironically fell because of his own ill-timed political moves.

Calling the shots during the tenure of the last BJP government, he however, failed to realise that it was none other than his alliance partner which was trying to weaken him by bringing about a split in the party. And though the HVC did not split legally, its most flamboyant member and public works minister Mohinder Singh, left the party along with quite a few supporters.

The downslide had started, and as the former union telecom minister broke away from the Congress after having been expelled from the party following the alleged telecom scandal, he was initially joined by disgruntled Congressmen all over the state, who found a new platform in the HVC and felt that it would flourish as a regional party in Himachal.

However, the props fell all too fast and any hopes of the party rejuvenating itself in the state dashed when despite expectations, Sukh Ram was not given a clean chit in the alleged telecom scandal case. Ironically, this happened despite the fact that the HVC is an ally of the NDA government at the centre.

But now with the countdown to the Lok Sabha elections having started, the HVC supremo is trying fast to regain lost ground. And though the AICC secretary and observer for Himachal Pradesh, Jaikishen made it very clear in Solan on Saturday, that there was no question of aligning with Sukh Ram as the former union telecom minister had been expelled from the party on charges of corruption, the HVC supremo is trying to paint a different picture.

According to reports, HVC working president Vijay Joshi said in Una that both the Congress and BJP had informally had talked about a possible alliance with the party, though a formal application had yet to be received. Leaders of both the parties have had discussions with Sukh Ram on the matter, he is reported to have said.

At stake for both the Congress and the BJP is the Shimla parlaimentary seat that was won by the HVC in the last Lok Sabha elections. As the BJP and the HVC were allies in the state government, the BJP left the Shimla seat for Sukh Ram''s party, while the HVC was to support the BJP in the other three Lok Sabha seats.

Needless to say the Congress was routed in the last Lok sabha elections in the state, not being able to win even one seat. While the BJP got three seats -- Mandi, Kangra and Hamirpur --, HVC''s Col Dhaniram Shandil wrested Shimla parliamentary seat, what is considered to be the citadel of the Congress.

Political circles are agog with talks that both the BJP and the Congress are trying to woo Shandil to contest on their symbol, as leaders of both parties feel that the retired colonel has prospects of retaining the seat, provided he has the support of the rank and file of their party. The reason, they claim is that the HVC''s rank and file has alomsot deserted the party.

Sukh Ram is trying his best to keep Shandil with him, as he feels that his bargaining prospects with either the Congress, or the BJP for that matter become all that better so long as his MP remains in tow, should the latter slip out, there is not much the HVC supremo will be able to get from the two major parties.

18,New EC to decide on election dates,"HYDERABAD: Uncertainty about the timing of the general elections continued here even though BJP general secretary Pramod Mahajan had announced on Saturday that they would be held in mid-March or early April 2004.

On Sunday, it became clear that this was merely what the party desires with their sources saying that the final election dates can be decided after the new Election Commissioner takes over on February 8.

And it is only after informal consultations with the new EC, that the Prime Minister will advise dissolution of Parliament: ""The PM does not want to be in the position that (Andhra Pradesh chief minister) Chandrababu Naidu is in, he dissolved the state Assembly, assuming that he could have elections in February, something that is not happening.""

Sources pointed out though the PM was now convinced about an early election and had said at last week''s NDA meeting, ""Ab vatavaran chunav ke liye anukul hain."" He would not dissolve Parliament unless he was convinced an early election was possible.

He did not want to be a lameduck PM for six months. Nor did he wish to create a constitutional crisis in case elections were not possible even after that. There is no provision for President''s Rule at the Centre.

So when general secretary Mukthar Abbas Naqvi was asked about the timings of the polls on the opening day of the national executive on Sunday, he said, ""It is 50-50"".

Elaborating, he said, ""It depends, 50 per cent on the party and 50 per cent on the government and EC. The BJP can''t decide the election dates. It can only give its suggestions.""

Party sources said uncertainty about poll timing continued because there were differences among the NDA partners and within the BJP, too, about convenient dates.

First, at the NDA meeting last week, the INLD''s Om Prakash Chautala and the Shiromani Akali Dal''s SS Dhindsa said elections between mid-April and mid-May did not suit them as that coincided with the harvesting season in their states. The JD-U''s Sharad Yadav added that Bihari migrant labour would not be able to vote as they would be in Punjab.

Second, within the BJP, Madhya Pradesh CM Uma Bharati told the PM that since the state police would be deployed to manage the Ujjain Kumbh Mela, scheduled between April 5 and May 5, it would be better not to have elections in that period.

Finally, in Andhra Pradesh, where Naidu dissolved the state Assembly in October 2003, if state elections are not held before end-March, President''s Rule may become necassary as a caretaker government cannot even pass a vote-on-account, leave alone a budget.

Moreover, Naidu would like elections before March 10, as school exams begin on March 17 and continue for a month. If elections are not held before March 17, the exam schedule would have to be changed.

However, regarding President''s Rule, the Andhra CM said on Sunday he was exploring legal alternatives to ensure that monies could be released to the state government without President''s Rule.

Given the lack of unanimity in the party and NDA about the dates of the general elections, BJP sources even said elections in September could not ruled out at this stage, stressing that the subject was yet to be thrashed out by the party.

Meanwhile, sources pointed out that the PM would be at the key BIMSTEC economic conference in Phuket, Thailand, on February 8-10, and though there was no bar on his attending it as a ""caretaker'' PM, it suited the government to continue till then as it would coincide with the appointment of the new EC.

19,PM asks Naidu to join NDA after polls,"HYDERABAD: Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee on Sunday appealed to Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister and TDP leader N Chandrababu Naidu to consider his request for joining the NDA Government after the Lok Sabha polls.

Ever since the formation of his government at the centre, he has been requesting Naidu to join it and, ""I hope he will consider this request after the elections,"" Vajpayee told a public meeting here.

He said his party is committed to coalition politics and had proved that it could be successfully carried out unlike in the past.

Lauding Naidu for extending outside support to his Government, Vajpayee also praised his government in taking up the challenge posed by Naxalites who had made an unsuccessful assassination attempt on the TDP leader''s life.

He asked extremist elements to abjure violence, saying nothing could be achieved by use of force.

The NDA Government was able to give a new look to the country in its four and half years rule, Vajpayee said likewise Naidu had done the same for Andhra Pradesh and complimented the Chief Minister and the people for the strides the state had made in various fields particularly Information Technology and for successfully holding the Afro-Asian Games.

The Centre was considering setting up an Indian Institute of Technology in Andhra Pradesh in line with his Independence Day announcement to expand the IIT network, Vajpayee said.

20,"Punjab, Haryana political scene to effect Chandigarh polls","CHANDIGARH: With clear indications about early general elections coming from BJP conclave at Hyderabad different political parties have started preparing themselves for a solitary Lok Sabha seat in Chandigarh.

Several issues including national as well as local besides the development in adjoining states of Punjab and Haryana are likely to play an all important role in the final outcome.

The BJP is likely to corner Congress on the issue of Prime Ministerial candidate with Sonia Gandhi''s foreign origin, the development plank of the NDA including economic reforms will also remain in focus.

On the other side Congress will be making increasing unemployment as one of its major issue against NDA government. The allegations of corruption against some of the BJP leaders will also remain high on the election agenda.

At the local level incumbent member of Parliament Pawan Bansal will approach the voters with his achievements. Bansal will project the developmental work by him during the last five years. He happens to be on the top of the list of MPs across the country who have spent most of their Local Area Development Funds. While BJP is planning to compare the work done by Congress led MC with BJP led MC.

In last general elections the infighting among the BJP had adversely affected them and this time they are trying to stay united.

Last but not the least political developments in the adjoining Punjab and Haryana will also play an important factor in the elections. Since Chandigarh happens to be the joint capital of the two states most of the employees working in various departments of two states are registered as voters in Chandigarh.

Moreover the population of Chandigarh predominantly consist of Punjabi and Harayanvi Diaspora. Obviously these voters will be influenced to a great extent by the political equations in their respective home states.
