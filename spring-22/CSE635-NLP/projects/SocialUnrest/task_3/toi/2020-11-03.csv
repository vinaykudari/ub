0,14 principals get on-the-spot appointments,"AHMEDABAD: In an unprecedented move, 14 secondary school principals were given on-the-spot appointment in recruitment camps held at three districts of the state, as part of the new recruitment policy announced by the government recently.

The camps are being held through the state from November 3-9. Co-ordinator of the recruitment camps, HN Hingu said it was the very first time that principals were called for an interview and handed appointment letters the same day.

â€œPrincipals came in the morning, gave their interviews and those selected were given approval by the district education officers and appointment letters by school managements the same day,â€� Hingu said.

Of the 14, nine principals were appointed in Sabarkantha and four at Valsad. The interviews did not take off well in Kheda so figures were not available for the district.

â€œOn Tuesday, interviews will be conducted at Anand, Narmada, Bharuch, Amreli and Sabarkantha. Over a period of one week, we propose to recruit 300 principals in the same way,â€� Hingu claimed.

Joint commissioner of schools and co-ordinator of the camps in north zone RC Rawal said the idea of holding such camps was that recruitment was done in a speedy and transparent manner.

â€œAfter the recruitment for principals is over, we plan to conduct similar camps for teachers in December,â€� Rawal said.

1,Vatva victims skip riot panel hearing,"AHMEDABAD: None of the witnesses from the Vatva area of the city, who were scheduled to depose before the Nanavati-Shah inquiry commission probing the post-Godhra riots, turned up on Monday.

In all 15 witnesses, whose deposition could not be recorded during the Diwali break, were listed to depose on Monday morning before the commission, comprising Justice (retd) G T Nanavati and Justice (retd) K G Shah.

2,Chinmayanand in party squabble,"LUCKNOW: In an unsavoury incident, depicting the resentment brewing within the rank and file of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the state, a group of youths, allegedly identified as supporters of Union minister of state for home Swami Chinmayanand, brutally thrashed district party general secretary in Jaunpur, Harish Chandra Singh, on Monday afternoon.

The minister was present at the site when the incident took place and eyewitnesses claimed that he, too, was dragged into the scuffle and his clothes were torn in the free-for-all that ensued.

Though no formal police complaint has been lodged in connection with the incident, party functionaries in Jaunpur were pursuing the issue with the top leaders in Delhi till late evening.

Reports said that Swami Chinmayanand, BJP MP from Jaunpur, was attending the meeting of Samanwai Samiti at a school in Tarapur colony area of Jaunpur.

Names were being proposed for the post of the partyâ€™s district president when it was mooted to first confirm if there was any candidate who could be elected unanimously to avoid a vote on the issue.

A little after noon, the meeting was at its peak and the election of the district president by voice vote was under way when one of the party functionaries announced that all those who were not entitled to vote for the election of the president should leave the room immediately as their presence might not lead to a fair election by way of voice vote.

This announcement left the Jaunpur district general secretary of BJP Harish Chandra Singh a bit uncomfortable, eyewitnesses told Times News Network on phone. Barely had Harish dared to point out that since Chinmayanand himself was an â€œoutsiderâ€� in that context, he should also leave the room.

This left the Union minister angry. Thereafter, some alleged supporters of Chinmayanand swooped down at Harish and began to assault him. Grossly outnumbered by the coterie of the union minister, Harish and his few followers had to bear the brunt of agitated followers of Chinmayanand.

Harish himself was allegedly attacked ruthlessly till he began to bleed from his nose and ears and had to be virtually grabbed away by some other party functionaries. Clothes torn, Harish was taken to a hospital where he was administered first aide and discharged. By late evening, he was trying to communicate the incident to Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and his deputy Lal Krishna Advani on phone seeking their shelter.

District president of Jaunpur unit of BJP Vidya Sagar Sonker, one among the dozens who were witness to the unruly scene, while talking to a local journalist, condemned the incident and said that the issue would be brought to the notice of the party leadership in Delhi.

On the ramifications of the incident, Vidya Sagar said that it was purely an internal issue of the party and, hence, the interference of any third party was not at all necessary.

3,Muslim women politically conscious: Survey,"LUCKNOW: Muslim women in India are more ''politically conscious'' in comparison to their Hindu sisters, but ironically their socio-economic status is only slightly better than the Dalit women and they hold much lower position than the Hindu upper caste and other backward class women.

However, despite variance in the status of education, economic condition and autonomy, the common factor among women belonging to all castes, classes and faiths was â€˜subjugation to patriarchyâ€™, states a survey conducted by Prof Zoya Hasan and Ritu Menon of Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi.

Entitled â€˜Unequal Citizens: Status of Muslim Women in Indiaâ€™, the survey was conducted covering 9,500 households in 40 districts across 12 states in the country, including UP and Bihar. It covered 60 per cent urban population and 40 per cent rural. As many as 80 per cent respondents were Muslim women and 20 per cent Hindus. Women questioned were between 16-60 years of age group.

The questionnaire was based on variables like education in terms of schooling and literacy, economic power in terms of income and employment, autonomy in terms of decision making, political participation, marriage and physical mobility.

While presenting her survey before students at a workshop at the Institute of Women Studies (IWS), Lucknow University, on Monday, Zoya said that though much hullabaloo is being raised in the country on issues related to personal laws and Muslim women, but the reality was that only two per cent of women were affected by it. The government, society at large, political parties and Muslim clergy seemed to be more concerned about raising and defending personal law questions, while neglecting basic issues related to education and upliftment of the socio-economic status of Muslim women in India, she stated.

The survey also dispels the myth that Hindu upper caste women by virtue of being more educated and belonging to economically good background, also enjoyed â€˜freedom of decision makingâ€™. â€œSixty two per cent women said that they find no major benefit of education in decision making in the family. As we moved up in the social status, we found lesser women enjoyed decision making power,â€� Zoya said.

â€œThe reason for low schooling in Muslim girls was found to be financial constraints and not parental opposition. However, due to pardah system their physical mobility and work in public sphere was restricted,â€� she said. Director IWS, Prof Roop Rekha Verma proposed the vote of thanks.

6,Karnataka govt had plenty of time: HC,"MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Monday issued an ultimatum to the Karnataka government to produce complete transcripts of the 56 tapes of telephonic conversations between fake stamp accused Abdul Karim Telgi and senior police officers of the Maharashtra police on November 10.

The judges asked the Karnataka governmentâ€™s counsel, â€œOn what basis is your additional director general of police saying that only the relevant portion will be given? How can you decide what is relevant?â€™â€™

In an affidavit, the Karnataka police officer said the conversations in several languages which extend to more than 100 hours needed at least 350 days to be translated.

â€œIt takes four to five days to transcribe an hourâ€™s conversation,â€™â€™ the Karnataka government advocate said. He said the tapes contained portions which were â€œpurely personal conversationsâ€™â€™ between Telgi and his family and were not relevant to case.

Advocate general Goolam Vahanvati said the Karnataka government had sufficient time to produce the transcripts. â€œIt doesnâ€™t take too long to make copies of 56 tapes. The tapes are required to show whether any unlawful demand has been made by top Mumbai police officers from Telgi.â€™â€™

Anna Hazareâ€™s counsel Majeed Memon also displayed impatience and even suspicion at the Karnataka governmentâ€™s stance. He rued the fact that the government had not complied with the orders for over two months spanning six hearings in the matter.

He said, â€œThe plea for another extension and selectively producing the tapes before the court gives rise to suspicion that the government is trying to shield some very powerful people involved in the scam. They are perhaps scared that either the Karnataka government or the Maharashtra government may fall due to the disclosures.â€™â€™

He pointed out that the taped conversations were about a year old and questioned Karnatakaâ€™s silence on the dates.

â€œWe are afraid that unless the tapes are produced immediately, they could even be tampered with.â€™â€™

7,"Produce Telgi tapes, HC orders Karnataka govt","MUMBAI: The Bombay high court Monday issued an ultimatum to the Karnataka government to produce complete transcripts of the 56 tapes of telephonic conversations between fake stamp accused Abdul Karim Telgi and senior police officers of the Maharashtra police on November 10.

A division bench took strong exception when counsel for the Karnataka government pleaded that the state be allowed submit only the relevant portions of the transcripts.

The conversations allegedly reveal that assistant police commissioner M C Mulani took a bribe of 15 lakhs from Telgi to prevent the arrest of the latterâ€™s wife.

The court directed that if the transcripts could not be produced on that day, the â€œcassettes and CDsâ€™â€™ should be placed in court.

The order came in response to yet another extension sought by the Karnataka government in producing the transcripts of the alleged taped conversations that it possesses.

The court directive comes in the wake of a public interest litigation filed by social activist Anna Hazare questioning the lack of a proper police probe into the multi-crore fake stamp scam.

The Karnataka governmentâ€™s counsel B.R. Nanjundaiah argued that the revealing portions did not pertain to the alleged conversation between Mulani and Telgi and â€œwould create havoc in the proper investigation of the case and its trialâ€™â€™.

However, he said the special investigation team probing the scam in Maharashtra could interact with its counterparts in Bangalore and the MCOCA court in Pune could scrutinise the recorded conversation in camera.However, Chief Justice C.K. Thakker and Justice Abhay Oka said â€œthe argument is irrelevantâ€™â€™.

The proposal assumes significance, considering that Congress president Sonia Gandhi had recently ruled out a pre-poll alliance with the NCP, following the controversial remarks by NCP president Sharad Pawar over her foreign origin issue.

Athawale has a good rapport with Pawar and his statement came as a surprise to party workers.

â€œMai apko jodne aya hoon. (I have come to unite you)â€� Athawale said on Monday while unveiling the statue of Babasaheb Ambedkar, installed at the Aund DP road chowk. Athawale calls for Cong.

9,Mamata's rally stops city traffic,"KOLKATA: Even as Trinamul Congress chairperson Mamata Banerjee on Monday said that her party would not cause any inconvenience to common people, traffic was thrown out of gear in central Kolkata by a rally staged by the Trinamul Youth Congress.

They were protesting against the deteriorating healthcare in the state and assault on journalists at the R.G.Kar Hospital.

The rally organisers occupied almost the entire carriageway from Raja Subodh Mullick Square to Rani Rashmoni Road disrupting traffic flow. Traffic movement along S.N. Banerjee Road, Lenin Sarani, Ganesh Chandra Avenue and J L Nehru Road was interrupted for 45 minutes.

Though there was a police bandobast at RSM square, policemen were conspicuous by their absence as Trinamul Youth Congress leader Sanjay Bakshi led the procession along S.N. Banerjee Road. The 2,000- strong rally took about half an hour to reach the venue of the meeting, where, however, the Trinamul leaders co-operated with the police.

â€œWe have already decided that except on July 21 we will not take out big rallies on weekdays,â€� Mamata said. â€œEven then, Trinamul supporters would walk along one side of the carriageway, allowing vehicles to pass,â€� she added.

Meanwhile, residents of New Barrackpore and Sukantanagar blocked the busy Jessore Road on Monday morning for an hour protesting against the assault on the scribes at the RG Kar Hospital.

Barasat based North 24 Parganas Press Bureau, an umbrella organisation of journalist of the district also staged a demonstration.

11,Conservative credit policy disappoints industry,"NEW DELHI: The Reserve Bank of Indiaâ€™s monetary policy, by all reckoning, has failed to go for the kill. Conditions have never been so good for the central bank to signal a reduction in interest rates and spur investment and growth.

Notwithstanding the customary â€˜â€˜welcomeâ€™â€™ accorded by chambers of commerce, the policy on Monday came as a disappointment to businesses, economists and government officials.

The stock market made history, with the Sensex crossing the 5,000-mark, on Monday but that was well before the RBI policy was out.

At a time when the world is taking note of the giant strides being made by the Indian economy this year, the RBIâ€™s monetary policy review just acknowledged the Indian growth story that everybody is talking about. It did nothing to give it that one more push that everybody expected.

RBI governor Vengopal Reddy scaled up the GDP growth forecast for the current year to 6.5-7 per cent from the 6 per cent projected in April and scaled down the estimate of inflation to 4-4.5 per cent from 5-5.5 per cent.

He pointed to a number of areas of strength in the Indian economy and brought out no obvious areas of immediate worries.

â€˜â€˜The only matter of immediate concern brought out in the RBI document is that banks are deploying most of their funds in government securities and they are still not finding other borrowers, except in one or two sectors like housing, even though interest rates may have consistently moved downward,â€™â€™ said an official.

â€˜â€˜There was a good case for the RBI to have induced further rate cuts to boost investment and growth. It has not done so,â€™â€™ he regretted.

The finance ministry, however, maintained that no opportunity has been lost. â€˜â€˜Any monetary authority worth its salt will take prompt and effective steps when the situation so demands. It wouldnâ€™t have to wait till a particular date of announcement or review of monetary policy,â€™â€™ said chief economic advisor Ashok Lahiri.

So, would the RBI cut its benchmark bank rate at which it lends to commercial banks any time soon? â€˜â€˜Thatâ€™s in the realm of speculation,â€™â€™ retorted Lahiri.

â€˜â€˜Central banks are always conservative. They are the epitome of stability. They could err on the side of caution,â€™â€™ Lahiri said.

â€˜â€˜It is a policy made keeping in view the current global uncertainties,â€™â€™ he said without specifying any particular uncertainty.

The disappointment of the business community was apparent from the way the exporters, for whom RBI made some concessions, reacted to the policy.

â€˜â€˜Nothing substantial has been done for exports particularly at a time when exporters were eagerly awaiting to see the RBIâ€™s response to the appreciation of the rupee which has hit export competitiveness,â€™â€™ said FIEO president Rafeeque Ahmed.

Officials acknowledged that governor Reddyâ€™s first policy was â€˜â€˜over-cautiousâ€™â€™ with the trademarks of a â€˜â€˜conservativeâ€™â€™ governor written all over it.

14,SEC notice to govt on transfer of officials,"BANGALORE: Days after the State Election Commission (SEC) directed the state government to put on hold the recent transfer of officials, chief secretary B S Patil said that not all officials transferred were likely to be directly involved in the election process.

""We will write to the SEC explaining our stand. However, if they still find fault with our move, the government will abide by whatever it recommends,"" Patil told Times News Network here on Monday.

Last week, the SEC had taken objection to the transfer of 126 police officials, including five SPs, on grounds that it violated the election code of conduct which is in place for by-elections to local bodies.

""The SEC has sought specific information on transfer of police and district level administrative staff. Since the elections are happening at the grassroots level - Gram Panchayat - we feel that the transfers may not disturb the election process,"" Patil explained.

With the government yet to reply to the matter, the SEC sent a reminder on Monday.

""Elections will be held in all 27 districts. All that we want to ensure is that the law and order situation is not disturbed because of the transfers,"" SEC commissioner C Chikkanna maintained.

The elections are being held on November 9 for 1,112 seats in various local bodies - 1,058 gram panchayat seats, four zilla panchayat seats, 28 taluk panchayat seats and 22 town municipality seats.

15,Prince Charles gives clap for The Rising,"MUMBAI: Ironical it may seem, but heir to the British throne Prince Charles on Tuesday gave a clap to the mahurat shot of a Bollywood film on Mangal Pandey, the Indian sepoy who revolted against the British Empireâ€™s mighty East India Company.

""Rising, mahurat shot, take one-clap"", a smiling Charles, dressed in a blue suit, said while giving the clap for the Ketan Mehta-directed Indo-British joint venture featuring Aamir Khan, Aishwarya Rai, Rani Mukherjee and Toby Stephens.

There was a loud round of applause as Charles gave the clap and later Aamir and Stephens â€” who play friends in the period film â€” enacted a scene from the movie on the specially erected set in the chandelier-lit Regal room of Oberoi Hotel in South Mumbai.

Earlier, the British Crown Prince was introduced to a host of dignitaries by Bobby Bedi, who is producing the film set against the backdrop of 1857 mutiny.

Charles shook hands and chatted with film-maker and distributor Manmohan Shetty, film-maker Yash Chopra, noted music composer A R Rahman, author Farooq Dhondy, lyricist Javed Akhtar and Ketan Mehta.

However, beauty queen-turned-actress Aishwarya Rai and Rani Mukherjee were conspicuous by their absence. Rai was busy in a shooting in New Delhi.

Later, Aamir told reporters that Charles evinced keen interest in the story of the film. ""The Prince knew about Mangal Pandey but asked a few questions about the main protagonist maybe to test my knowledge"", he said in a jocular vein.

Charles talked to Bollywood personalities, especially composer A R Rahman and actress Kiron Kher and posed for photographs with bigwigs of the film industry.

Aamir said he was ""little nervous"" while giving the shot for the film in the presence of the Prince. ""But I am glad that he came here"", the actor said.

""The film is about equality and the Prince believes in it, that is why he came here and it shows his inclination"", Aamir said.

Asked whether the film is anti-British, Ketan Mehta, who is directing the historical venture, said ""it is pro-human"".

""Basically, it is a story of a friendship between an Indian sepoy and a British officer and how their relationship comes under stress"", Mehta said.

In the much-talked about film, being produced by Kaleidoscope Entertainment Ltd, Aamir plays the main protagonist Mangal Pandey, while Stephens is a British officer, Captain William Gordon.

The shooting for the film would begin in January and is likely to get over sometime in May, Aamir, who has grown a moustache and has turned vegetarian for this movie, said.

Asked which aspect of Mangal Pandey''s character fascinated him most, Aamir said ""the character is not sure of himself but does things which appeal to him"".

The film would be shot on the outskirts of Delhi and Pune, the actor added.

16,Shares rally on foreign funds inflow,"NEW DELHI: Shares rose for the third session on Tuesday on expectations that foreign investments would remain strong in coming months amid sentiment buoyed by hopes of upgrades to earnings outlooks, traders said.

Investors also shuffled money out of bond funds betting that interest rates could have bottomed out after the central bank kept rates unchanged at its mid-term review of monetary policy on Monday.

The 30-issue benchmark Bombay share index closed up 0.69 per cent at 5,097.84 points, taking gains in the past three sessions to 6.5 per cent. The index hit a 43-month closing high on Monday also.

Volume was heavy at 174 million shares, compared with 154 million the previous day but market breadth was negative, with losers outpacing gainers 962 to 691.

â€œOverseas funds donâ€™t want to miss out on the big action in India,â€� said Falguni Nayar, a director at Kotak Securities. â€œInvestors are hopeful of earnings upgrades after a strong quarterly performance.â€�

Foreign funds added $1.5 billion worth of Indian shares to their holdings in October, their highest net investment in a single month since the country allowed foreign portfolio investments a decade ago.

On Monday, they added a further $110.9 million, taking their net purchases in 2003 to around $4.7 billion, more than six times the total for the whole of last year.

Cement shares were driven higher on expectations firm prices and robust demand will boost profits in coming months. Gujarat Ambuja Cements Ltd, rallied 6.8 per cent to Rs 282.35, while Grasim Industries Ltd, gained 4.1 per cent to Rs 920.15.

Hindalco, the top aluminium maker, climbed 4.1 per cent to Rs 1,235.15 after it raised prices between 1.15-2.2 per cent per tonne.

Dr Reddyâ€™s Laboratories Ltd jumped 7.9 per cent to Rs 1,415.50, adding to Mondayâ€™s 10 per cent rise, after it received final approval from the USFDA to sell a version of Pfizer Incâ€™s anti-hypertension treatment Norvasc.

Traders said Mondayâ€™s mid-term review of monetary policy by the central bank had also boosted investor sentiment. The central bank raised its economic growth forecast to 6.5-7 per cent for the fiscal year to March, with an upward bias, from an earlier estimated of 6 per cent.

It left interest rates unchanged, dashing hopes of further falls in bond yields. â€œIf rates are stable, there wonâ€™t be much excitement in the bond markets and a lot of MF inflows will turn to share markets,â€� said Devesh Kumar, at ICICI Securities.

18,"BJP, SP gird up for Vidhan Parishad polls","LUCKNOW: Elections to the 36 Vidhan Parishad local bodies scheduled for December 1 are being viewed as an acid test for both the ruling Samajwadi Party and the opposition BJP, the two main contendors in the poll.

While for the BJP it would be a case of retaining its hold over the 20 seats which are currently in its kitty, for the Samajwadi Party it would be more a case of wresting the same from the saffron party in addition to maintaining its hold over the 12 seats currently occupied by its members.

In the elections to these 36 seats, held in 1998, the BJP had won 20, SP 12, Congress and independants 2 each.The victory of the independants then had also been credited to the BJP.

Though these elections are not contested on party symbols, yet political parties declare the names of their candidates, an exercise currently being undertaken by all the mainstream parties. The state unit of the BJP according to party spokesman Hirday Narain Dixit is expected to finalise the list of the candidates Tuesday night. ""This list would be forwarded to the central election committee for final approval and would be released in a couple of days time,"" stated Dixit, adding that the party would contest in all the 36 seats.

The exercise is already underway in the Samajwadi Party with party president and chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav having already held a meeting of the district and city chiefs in addition to the block level officers on Saturday last.Given the SP hold at the zila panchayat level and with the district administration reportedly known to play an active role in such elections, the prospects of the SP bettering its record is not being precluded.

The Congress which has Mukul Nagar and Rajeshpati Tripathi as its MLCs has apparently yet to get its act together. Insiders however, state that while Nagar is eager to contest again, Tripathi has shown his reluctance.

Around 113,000 voters would be exercising their franchise in these elections. The voters would include MLAs, MPs, gram pradhans, block development committee members, block pramukhs, zila panchayat chairman and members, nagar panchyat and nagar palika chairman and corporators and nagar pramukhs of nagar nigams.

The notification and nomination for the polls would take place on November 7 with scrutiny of the papers slated for the 15th. The last date for withdrawal is also 15th, with the counting fixed for December 3.

The elected MLCs would assume office on January 15, 2004 when the term of the present legislators comes to an end.
