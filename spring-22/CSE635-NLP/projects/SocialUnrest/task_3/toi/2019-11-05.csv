0,State may create problems during polls: Badungar,"AMRITSAR: Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee president Kirpal Singh Badungar fears state-sponsored bloodshed during the ensuing presidential elections of the committee. Badungar said he was apprehensive that Sarb Hind Shiromani Akali Dal president Gurcharan Singh Tohra, with the help of his sympathisers in the Congress government, would try to secure the arrest of his personal assistant Raghubir Singh and the secretary to SGPC Harbeant Singh to influence the committeeâ€™s working just before the elections. Badungar, while talking to TNN on Monday, also expresseed his anxiety on what he called the state governmentâ€™s tactics to wean away the Shiromani Akali Dal Badal (SAD-B) loyal SGPC members by fair or foul means with the sole aim of dislodging SAD chief P S Badal from his last citadel. The larger gameplan of the Tohra-Congress combine, he said, is to take control of the SGPC, also known as mini- parliament of Sikhs, by pitching their favourities in strategic positions in the committee. Badungar, who has also served as an Officer on Special Duty to Badal, alleged that he had information that the government could use policemen masquerading as nihangs to disturb the committee elections and initiate violence if they found their nominees â€˜â€˜in disguiseâ€™â€™ loosing. However, Badungar remained cautious, adding that nothing could provoke SAD-B or their loyal SGPC members to strike back. He preferred using the term â€˜â€˜sacrificesâ€™â€™ to appeal to Punjabis living around the world to keep an eye on the electoral process on the D-Day. He added that they were seriously considering inviting the international media to act as neutral observers. They may also be taking protection of central security forces, he added. The president of the SGPC, who is readying for the ultimate fight with backing from SAD-B, also didnâ€™t rule out the possibility of arrest of some of SGPC employees in the near future on various pretexts while blaming senior Panthic Morcha leader Ravi Inder Singh for allegedly masterminding the whole operation. He alleged that the Ravi Inder group, enjoying the patronage of chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh, had emerged as a parallel constitutional body. As a part of the governmentâ€™s coercive policy, he was allegedly passing orders to the state police to unleash a spate of terror on Badal loyalist SGPC members and their families to force them to shift sides, he said. He cited the examples wherein police personnel had directed the family members of few SGPC members to contact Ravi Inder Singh. Rubbishing governmentâ€™s statements of not interfering with the SGPC elections, Badungar said that it was the governmentâ€™s pressure only that had forced their members to take shelter in the neighbouring states but expressed faith that â€˜â€˜none of their sepoy would betray themâ€™â€™.

The minister said that one way of tackling the issue of social security in the unorganised sector could be by expanding and strengthening the existing institutional mechanism of EPF and Employees State Insurance.
