0,Hindu body protests bias against pilgrims,"AMRITSAR: Surinder Kumar Billa, president of All India Hindu Shiv Sena, has censured Pakistan High Commission for adopting double standards and causing a religious divide in India by refusing pilgrimage visa to one community and allowing another.

1,Raids politically motivated: BSP,"LUCKNOW: The Bahujan Samaj Party has termed the raids conducted by the CBI at residences of former chief minister Mayawati and former minister Naseemuddin Siddiqui as â€œpolitically motivatedâ€� and intended to malign the image of party leaders.

Talking to reporters, BSP legislature party leader Swami Prasad Maurya on Wednesday said that the CBI could not get any thing incriminating during these raids and took away the money which partymen had donated for the medical treatment of BSP founder Kanshi Ram. Maurya said that if such raids were conducted on residences of present or former ministers belonging to the BJP, much more would be recovered.

The raids, he said, had no rationale, more so when elections to the five state assemblies were announced. Maurya said that the BSP would not be cowed down by such raids and would teach the BJP a lesson at an appropriate time.

State BSP president Barkhu Ram Verma also criticised the BJP for raids on the residences of former chief minister and said that the prime minister was behind these raids. Verma said that the BSP would emerge even stronger by these raids because the morale of party workers was high. The BJP, he said, would have to pay heavy price for these raids.

Meanwhile, supporters of Mayawati lodged their protest against these raids by shouting slogans in her favour. â€œBehenji mat ghabrana hum tumhare sath hainâ€� rent the air while the CBI teams were searching the residences of Mayawati and Naseemuddin in the heart of the city.

The extent of loyalty towards these leaders could be gauged from the fact that despite presence of police and other law enforcing agencies, BSP workers and supporters of the former chief minister could not be pushed away from the places where raids were taking place. The protesters refused to believe that Behenji had amassed wealth.

2,PW running parallel govt in Chhattisgarh,"KHAMMAM: A dry run for the claymore mine blast on chief minister Chandrababu Naidu''s convoy in Tirumala last week was indeed conducted several weeks ago by the People''s War (PW) in Dantewada district of Chhattisgarh, sources in the Maoist guerrilla group have confirmed.

Reliable sources reiterated on Wednesday that the trial was carried out in a training camp run by the PW in the thick forests of Dantewada district bordering Khammam.

People''s War sources said the guerrilla group never discloses its ambush attacks or dry runs even to its own lower cadres before or after such attacks. ""We implement the directions of the CC (Central Committee). The CMC (Central Military Commission, the PW''s military arm) had held a camp in the Dantewada forest two months ago. After the dry run, an attempt was made on the life of the Dantewada superintendent of police Purushottam and an attack was carried out on the Gidam police station in Chhattisgarh.

The SP had a narrow escape when he was shot at from a close distance on Sept. 12. On Sept. 13, the PW attacked the Gidam police station, 125 km from the Khammam border, and killed three constables and carried away a large number of arms and ammunition.

In fact, the PW has reportedly been running a parallel government in many blocks in Dantewada district in the last one year. About 100 sarpanches in the district have resigned after the PW asked them to do so or bite the bullet.

Village development committees set up by the PW look into the revenue affairs of villages. People in the AP-Chhattisgarh border villages pay revenue to these committees. A group of tribals from AP who had migrated to Chhattisgarh and who had 15-25 acres of land have started returning to Khammam and Godavari districts as they could not meet the demands of the PW.

The naxalite group has reportedly asked farmers having more than 10 acres to pay 50 per cent of their produce as party fund. ""There is no government in Dantewada district. The police are in the grip of fear,"" said a sarpanch from Kunta block in Chintur mandal, about 8 km from Khammam border.

3,Lyngdoh not to join politics,"PATNA: Chief Election Commissioner J M Lyngdoh said here on Wednesday that the countryâ€™s election process can be improved if the electors are vested with the right to recall an elected representative.

Lyngdoh, who was speaking on the topic â€œStrengthening Ethics in Todayâ€™s Election Processâ€� at a function held at St Xavierâ€™s High School by an NGO, Humlog, to mark its first foundation day talk, said during the elections, neither the executive, nor the legislature, nor even the judiciary is in a position to take on politicians at their â€œfurious bestâ€�. Humlog convener Parveen Amanullah gave details of the activities of the NGO.

Lyngdoh called election time as â€œabnormalâ€�, adding: â€œPeople are in a frenzy. You can see the worst in human beings during elections. The Election Commission (EC) has no instrument, except the Code of Conduct. It is a mechanism that reduces the government concerned to the level of opposition.â€�

Under the circumstances, voters alone enjoy the power to improve the election process and the quality of elected representatives, Lyngdoh said, adding: â€œRight to recall is a good thing.â€� According to him, bureaucrats, for that matter the EC, can only make small beginnings. He felt that bureaucrats and men in uniform had done a commendable job during the Gujarat elections.

On the recent trend of bureaucrats and judges joining politics, he said he has no inclination to join politics. â€œI will never in my life join politics,â€� he said. According to him, the presence and participation of criminals in politics, together with the defection and play of money in elections, have vitiated the election process. Earlier, ideologies used to hold together different political parties, but political parties lacking the ideological glue have now become vulnerable to frequent defections, he said.

Stating that â€œpolitics had always been the seat of criminalsâ€�, Lyngdoh said while the Centre did not readily respond to the ECâ€™s recommendation that a candidate should file an affidavit giving information if he or she has ever been convicted, a voter moved the Delhi HC pleading that candidates should disclose their involvement in criminal incidents, their assets and liabilities as well as their qualification.

4,Patna City observes bandh,"PATNA: The markets of Patna City observed a complete bandh on Wednesday in protest against the failure of the police to nab the killers of Sardar Ravindar Singh, who was shot dead on October 2.

Business community of the area took out a procession and handed over a memorandum to the SDO (Patna City) demanding proper security arrangements for them.

Activists of various political parties, including Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and CPI(ML), also took out procession in support of the agitation launched by the Patna City traders.

Criticising the murder of Sardar Ravindar, the Mahanagar unit of BJP, in a press release, said businessmen of the state live under fear in the present regime. Bihar Textile Chamber of Commerce demanded creation of a special wing of police to check the growing crime graph particularly incidents of attack on the businessmen in Bihar.

The Cement Dealersâ€™ Association organised a condolence meeting to pay tributes to the slain businessman on Wednesday. A press release issued by the association demanded immediate arrest of the criminals involved in the killing.

Bihar Pradesh Marwari Sammelan also supported the bandh and demanded license to purchase arms. A team of the Sammelan, led by Kamal Nopani, also visited several places of the locality to ensure the success of the bandh call.

Bihar Pradeshik Agrawal Sammelan (BPAS) urged the traders to observe an indefinite bandh to check the attacks on the business community. â€œA dayâ€™s bandh call will not help the cause of traders nor will it create an adequate pressure on the state government,â€� said a press release issued by the BPAS. Its president, Jagdish Prasad Mohanka, demanded that the state government should hold a meeting with the tradersâ€™ bodies to work out a concrete strategy for their safety. â€œIf the government fails to check the criminal activities in the state, it will badly affect its economy,â€� the release said.

Shot at: Some unknown miscreants shot at a staff of the local Uma cinema in Park Road area under Kadamkuan police station on Wednesday night. The victim is being treated at the PMCH.

5,"Union, Bihar ministers shed their 'niceties'","PATNA: With elections nearing, Union and Bihar ministers seem to be saying goodbye to political niceties in their mutual dealings as for the second consecutive day on Wednesday Bihar ministers boycotted a function organised by Union minister for small-scale industries C P Thakur here.

""The boycott of Union ministers will continue. They misuse the government machinery and indulge in political drama. They have no commitment to development of the state,"" alleged Bihar minister for small-scale industries Ravindra Charan Yadav.

""We had invited the CM, RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav and state government ministers to attend the exhibition on small-scale industries organised by the National Small-Scale Industries Corporation. But they did not come. If they had any grievance, it could have been sorted out,"" Thakur said, adding that he would undertake development work with or without the state government''s help.

""There is only one industry in Bihar and that is kidnapping. Laloo Prasad Yadav is the chairman of the kidnapping private company and the chief minister is its MD,"" remarked junior Union minister Nagmani. ""We invite the Union ministers to have a debate on the issue. The Union government has virtually kidnapped the nation,"" retorted Ravindra Charan. Railway minister Nitish Kumar said at a function on Wednesday that those who accuse the Union government of giving stepmotherly treatment to Bihar are mentally sick. And Bihar ministers have started calling Nitish ""mentally retarded"".

Five Union ministers, including Nitish and defence minister George Fernandes, present at Thakur''s function on Wednesday claimed that it is the Union ministers hailing from Bihar who are instrumental in whatever development work done in the state. They accused the state government of putting obstacles in the development work like trying to stall the construction of a railway bridge at Nirmali in Madhubani district.

""The Union ministers'' function was not a government one. It was an NDA rally. The platform was used to criticise the state government,"" alleged Charan. He said during the last three years, he has written numerous letters to the Centre regarding demands, including the plea for declaring Bihar an industrially backward state like the North-Eastern states. ""We submitted proposals for industrial projects worth Rs 432.8 crore. But none of the Union ministers bothered to take cognisance of our pleas,"" Charan said.

The mud-slinging goes on. The victim has been Bihar''s development work. The latest survey conducted by the Union ministry for small-scale industries suggests that 80 per cent of the units in Bihar are sick.

6,Power board asked to increase revenue collection,"PATNA: The state government has asked the BSEB to enhance the monthly revenue collection to the tune of Rs 80 crore by December 2003. The present monthly revenue collection of the BSEB is between Rs 60 to 65 crore.

The government has expressed strong displeasure over the tardy progress in the revenue collection of BSEB. All the 16 circles of the state have only succeeded in generating 30 to 60 per cent of the target of revenue collection. These matters were discussed at a meeting of GMs of all the power area boards held here on Wednesday at the BSEB headquarters to discuss the ways and means to enhance the revenue collection of the Board.

7,Pope wanted to break rules for Mother,"NEW DELHI: Breaking all rules and precedents that govern the canonization process of the Roman Catholic Church, Pope John Paul II wanted to declare Mother Teresa as a saint on October 19, but many Vatican officials raised objections to it.

A Boston-based weekly, the Catholic World News, recently reported that the Pope sent letters to the members of the Roman curia in June asking about the possibilities of both canonizing and beatifying Mother Teresa on October 19 â€” unusual in the history of the Roman Catholic Church.

Most of the the bishops the Pope consulted, advised him against such a step.

According to Roman Catholic traditions, beatification is the first step to canonization. A beatified person is called â€˜â€˜blessedâ€™â€™ and will be venerated by the believers in his/her diocese or birth place. A person will be canonized five years after beatification. A canonized person is called a saint and can be worshipped all over the world by the believers of the Catholic church.

The Pope, who was a firm supporter of Mother Teresa, has already made an exemption in case of her canonization process by starting the process much ahead of the presribed time.

According to canon laws passed by the Pope in 1983, the process starts five years after the saintâ€™s death. Mother Tersaâ€™s canonization process ought to have started on September 2002, but started much earlier as the Pope waived the five-year period.

In the history of the Roman Catholic Church, St Anthony of Padua is the only person who was declared as a saint just 352 days after his death.

8,National labour conference likely to reform laws,"NEW DELHI: A major national level Labour Conference will be held on October 16 to 18, which will take a final decision on the three basic labour issues - rationalisation of labour laws and unorganised labour; employment generation and social security issues.

Labour ministry sources told the Times of India on Wednesday that employer organisations, workers organisations, governments of central, state and union territories have been requested to nominate their delegates/advisors to attend the meeting.

He said that each delegate will be allowed to bring one adviser to attend the session but the latter will not be allowed to speak.

The ensuing labour conference will discuss the report of the second National Commission on Labour with emphasis on rationalisation of labour laws and unorganised labour.

There are a plethora of labour laws covering various facets of labour issues such as factories, mines, plantations, transport, shops and commercial establishments, industrial housing, safety and welfare, wages, social security, industrial relations, employment and training, emigration, compensation insurance etc. Labour comes under Concurrent List hence the implementations of the law is incumbent upon both the Centre and states.

With a view to bring about labour reform, the government had set up the second Labour Commission whose job was to suggest rationalisation of existing labour laws in the organised sector and suggest ''umbrella'' legislation for ensuring a minimum level of protection to the workers in the unorganised sector.

While doing this ""the Commission took into account the emerging economic environment involving rapid technological changes, globalisation of economy, liberalisation of trade and industry and emphasis on international competitiveness and the need for bringing the existing laws in tune with the future labour market needs and demands,"" an official said.

9,EC ready for early LS polls: Lyngdoh,"PATNA: The Election Commission on Thursday expressed readiness to conduct early Lok Sabha polls but favoured September next year as the ""ideal"" time if the exercise is held on schedule.

""EC is prepared to conduct election even if the government decides to go for an early poll. But September 2004 would be an ideal month from weather point of view for holding the next parliamentary polls,"" Chief Election Commissioner J M Lyngdoh told reporters here.

To a question whether the present laws were adequate for holding free and fair elections, the CEC said, ""Laws are there. We only need good people to implement them to check rigging and other malpractices.""

Lyngdoh, however, suggested some amendments to the anti-defection law to completely prohibit elected representatives from crossing floors. Crossing floor is the betrayal of the worst kind,"" he said.

He suggested it would be better if instead of the Speaker, the President, in consultation with the EC, decided the fate of a party in case that suffered a split.

He also said it would be better if the EC was armed with some legal powers to take preventive actions against leaders and political parties before announcement of the poll wherever the Commission thought it necessary.

10,Govt failed to protect farmers: Bommai,"MANGALORE: All India Progressive Janata Dal (AIPJD) national presidents, S R Bommai, on Thursday lamented that the failure on the part of successive governments at the Centre in framing a comprehensive agricultural policy was the bane of the farming community and was resulting in suicides.

Speaking after inaugurating the party workers meet and training camp of the party at Palke Krishnachar hall, Bommai alleged that both the state and centre were following anti-people policies because of which the common man, including farmers were in distress.

He said when they were at the Centre, a sum of Rs 3,000 crore in interest and principal was waived off to help farmers in distress during drought.

But what has the state or the Centre done to help farmers, he questioned.

Terming the BJP and Congress as opposite faces of the same coin, Bommai urged party workers to reach out to the people and make possible that the party would emerge as an alternative to both.

Party State president K N Nage Gowda said the party would organise such training camps and conventions at all district head quarters in the next three months.

He categorically ruled out alliances with both the Congress and the BJP in the forthcoming polls.

Party leader B Somashkekar alleged that chief minister S M Krishna was trying to hoodwink people with his people contact programme when the polls were nearing.

M C Nanaiah, M Raghupathy, Jayaprakash Hegde, B A Mohideen, Mahima Patel, Basavaraj Bommai and others were present at the camp.

Third Front: Later speaking to the media, Bommai said there was a possibility that a third front may emerge as an alternative to Congress and BJP at the national level soon.

Though he did not specify the details, he said efforts were on to put down the personal egos aside and form the front to combat the two national parties.

He agreed that personal egos were the stumbling block for the emergence of the third front at the national level.

Bommai also dubbed S M Krishna''s people contact programme as a political stunt before the polls.

""Where was he when farmers were committing suicide? Did any leader visit the farmers'' family when they needed succour,"" he questioned.

He also pointed out that while Maharashtra had defied Apex court''s order on release of Bheema waters to Bijapur, Krishna had let Cauvery waters to Tamil Nadu. All these reflected the concern Krishna government had towards people, he added.

11,Cross-complaints filed over firing incident,"VADODARA: A four-year-old land dispute in the Panigate area here led to firing and violence on Wednesday afternoon. Crosscomplaints in the case were registered by the Panigate police station and two persons were arrested on Thursday.

The incident took place in the Wadi Navapura area at the shop of one Jetha Megha Rabari. Jetha in his complaint alleged that a builder, Ramesh â€˜Michaelâ€™ Kahar, demanded money over a land deal in the past and pointed a gun at him. An FIR filed with the Panigate police by Jetha alleged that Kahar fired a shot at him.

However, Jethaâ€™s son, Sanjay, intervened and pushed Kahar which caused the shot to miss Jetha. A crowd allegedly gathered after the incident and beat up Kahar, who later managed to escape from the spot. He had come to Jethaâ€™s shop with an aide who drove him away from the place on a two-wheeler. Police said the incident took place over a land dispute about four years ago.

Jetha was the caretaker of a 60,000 square-foot plot near Mahesh Complex that belonged to one of his relatives. Another man, Bachu Chuni Mali, was cultivating the land but later made several agreements promising to sell the land. One such agreement was made with Vimal Vasant Shah, a builder based in Karelibag. However, Jetha obtained a stay on the deal. Shah later handed over the matter to Kahar asking him to settle the dispute for him.

An amount of Rs 4 lakh was reportedly paid to Jetha for vacating the stay. After the compromise, construction also began at the place. However, Jetha alleged that late on Wednesday Kahar came back demanding the money. An argument ensued, and Kahar allegedly pulled out his gun and tried to fire at Jetha. The incident was reported to the Panigate police late in the evening.Kahar,who was beaten up, was admitted to a private clinic after the incident.

Kahar, on Thursday, registered an FIR against Jetha and his son alleging that they had called him to settle the dispute at their shop. However, he alleged, they gathered persons armed with sticks there and beat him up. Police arrested both Jetha and his son in connection with the FIR. Investigating officer in the case police inspector Bhagirathsinh Jadeja said while Kahar had made the allegations of his being beaten up, he never mentioned the firing episode in his FIR. â€œWe will question him on the issue once he recovers.â€�

12,"13 Bakery accused arrested, get bail","VADODARA: Thirteen of the 21 persons acquitted in the Best Bakery case were arrested and produced before the fast track court of Justice H U Mahida on Thursday. They were given conditional bail after signing a surety of Rs 10,000 each.

The Supreme Court had, in an observation in the plea filed by the complainant Zahira Shaikh, indicted the Gujarat government for the shoddy handling of the Best Bakery case. This had led to the state government amending its appeal for retrial in the Gujarat High Court. Following this, the division bench of Justice D K Trivedi and Justice M S Shah, had ordered for bailable warrants against the 21 persons on September 29.

The court of Justice Mahida had acquitted the accused after 37 of the 73 witnesses, including Zahira, turned hostile. Fourteen people were killed in the bakery carnage. The 13 who were produced before the court on Thursday include Pratap Ravji Chauhan, Sana Chiman Baria, Bahadursinh Chauhan, Ramesh Jayanti Gohil, Harshad Ravji Solanki, Jayanti Jamsinh Gohil, Mafat Manilal Gohil, Shailesh Tadvi, Raju Gambhir Baria, Pankaj Virendra Gosai, Harish Virendra Gosai, Yasin Ali Khokhar and Jagdish Chunnilal Rajput.

When asked about the remaining eight, defence counsel in the Best Baskery Rajendra Trivedi said, â€œThree persons have gone to Delhi to file an affidavit before the Supreme Court while the remaining five persons have gone to Gujarat High Court. They will be bailed out on Friday and Saturday.â€�

Most of the accused have now left their fate to God. â€œIts tough to continue business with the tag of being an accused in the Best Bakery case,â€� said sJagdish Rajput who had earlier been acquitted in the case. â€œNow we can only wait and watch.â€� Yasin Ali Khokhar, a truck driver who had also been acquitted by the court said, â€œEveryone recognises us as the Best Bakery accused. It has become tough to earn a living with that tag.â€�

13,Haryana govt denies distress selling of paddy,"CHANDIGARH: Financial commissioner and principal secretary (food and supplies) H C Disodia claimed here on Thursday that there had been no distress sale of paddy in any part of Haryana so far.

Denying the allegations being levelled by a section of farmers that paddy was being sold at a price less than the minimum support price(MSP), he said even chief minister Om Prakash Chautala had been paying surprise visits to mandis to ensure that the farmers were not put to any hardship during the ongoing paddy procurement drive.

The farmers themselves had told the chief minister that the arrangements made for procurement operations were quite satisfactory and the paddy was being procured at the minimum support price.

He said nearly 4.65 lakh metric tonnes of paddy had so far arrived in mandis, out of which 69,202 metric tonnes was Basmati and about 4 lakh tonnes leviable. Out of leviable paddy, nearly two lakh metric tonnes had been purchased by the millers and dealers and another two lakh metric tonnes had been purchased by government agencies.

He stressed that 1.88 lakh metric tonnes of paddy had been purchased by millers at a price higher than the minimum support price.

14,Industrial scene looking up in Karnataka: minister,"BANGALORE: Industries minister R V Deshpande on Thursday said the industrial scenario in the state was looking up and the state government had cleared projects worth Rs 5,018 crore upto July this year.

He told reporters that the high-powered committee on investments had cleared 20 mega projects including setting of the Rs 2,060 crore telecom and knowledge special economic zone (SEZ) by Global Telecom City Developers Ltd, near Hoskote and TVS motor company''s Rs 500 crore manufacturing unit at Mysore.

While General Motors had come forward to set up an R&D centre for engineering development, CAD designs, Biocon India had submitted proposals to the government to take up bio-technology projects. ""The single window agency has also cleared 59 projects worth Rs 1,211.92 crore,"" he added.

Stating that the two bills - special economic zone (SEZ) bill and the Industries Facilitation bill had been sent for Presidential assent, he said the bills once approved would revolutionise the industrial scene in Karnataka.

In the Industries Facilitation bill, the government had included a provision whereby anyone desiring to start an industry in the state should get clearance within 35 days.

""If there is a delay, it will be deemed to be cleared and the industry can start functioning. Besides, there is a provision for industrialists to go in for self-certification. This will not only boost our investments but create confidence among industrialists. We hope both the bills will be cleared by this month end,"" the minister said.

Admitting that the SEZ created in Hassan had not evoked good response from industries, Deshpande said the SEZ bill which aims at providing several tax exemptions for industries would attract investments.

15,Development Plan road through BV to remain open,"PUNE: Bowing down to the public pressure, the civic general body meeting on Thursday unanimously passed a resolution asserting that the 60 foot wide Development Plan road, passing through the premises of the Bharti Vidyapeeth, off Satara road, should be kept open for public vehicles.

However, in a contradictory move, the ruling Congress party and NCP together, rejected the BJP-Shiv Sena''s demand to quash the state government''s controversial proposal to delete the BV road from the Development Plan of Pune. Instead, the NCP and Congress resolved to send back the controversial proposal to the state government.

Thus, the general body has failed to take a decision on the state government''s proposal within the mandatory 60 days period. As per the rules, the government can now initiate the road deletion move on its own.

Highly placed sources in Congress told TNN, that though the two decisions taken by the general body seem contradictory to each other, they have been worked out after an elaborate strategy.

The Congress was in minority in the house as the NCP had announced to support the BJP-Sena''s demand to quash the government''s road deletion proposal. The Congress leaders convinced the NCP members that if the government''s proposal gets defeated in the house, then it will send a wrong signal across the state, which is governed by the Congress-NCP combine.

Hence, the two parties decided not to take any decision on the government''s proposal and instead resolved to refer it back to the state government.

This has served two purposes: Firstly, the Congress has been saved from the embarrassment of getting defeated in the house. Also, it may not invite the wrath of the voters as the proposal pressing that the BV road should be kept open for traffic, was tabled by Congress leader Ajit Apte and NCP''s Shantilal Suratwala.

At the same time, the ruling party has kept the doors open for the state government to initiate the process for deleting the road from the DP of Pune. Now, instead of the PMC, the state government can ask the state town planning department to call suggestions and objections from the citizens for deleting the road.

""This is a victory for BJP and Shiv Sena. Owing to our protest the general body, including the Congress, has unanimously passed a resolution in support of road,"" leader of the opposition, Vijay Kale, told reporters.

Admitting that the BJP and Sena would have been more happy had the government''s road deletion proposal been quashed. Kale said, ""We did not had enough numbers to defeat the move.""

He pointed out that the proposal tabled by BJP''s Gopal Chintal demanding the general body to quash the government''s proposal, was defeated with 38 BJP-Sena votes in favour while 53 Congress-NCP votes against.

However, now the PMC administration, the general body and the state Lokayukta, have ruled in favour of a public road from BV premises. ""If the state government honours our democratic system then it will withdraw the road deletion move,"" Kale said.
