0,Punjab teachers hold ‘anti-repression' rally,"AMRITSAR: The Punjab and Chandigarh College Teachers Union (PCCTU) observed the Teachers Day by holding â€˜anti-repression'' rally, staging dharna and raising heated slogans against the management and the principals of DAV Colleges on September 5. As many as 200 teachers of various private affiliated colleges participated in the rally which was held to protest against the suspension of teachers by the DAV College managing committee and principals.

The agitating teachers demanded that the suspension of teachers of DAV Colleges and other privately managed colleges, who were implicated in vigilance cases, be revoked. They said that the Punjab governor had reinstated all the teachers of government colleges who were suspended after the filing of vigilance cases.

It is to be noted that in Amritsar, the local Vigilance Bureau had conducted raids on the residences of KK Gupta, vice-principal; RK Bhatia, VP Bhatnagar and MP Sadana, professors of DAV College in May for allegedly taking private tuitions. The principal had suspended Bhatia and Gupta while Sadana and Bhatnagar had resigned.

HS Walia, unit president, PCCTU, threatened to intensify the agitation if the suspensions were not revoked. RK Kaushal rued that instead of honouring the teachers, government and managing committees were bent on harassing them. The rally was also addressed by VK Sharma, Bhushan Lal, SN Joshi, RS Saini, RK Jha, Neelam Kumari and Sushma Chawla.

1,BJP to protest tribal kids' deaths,"MUMBAI: The state BJP has announced an agitation programme to focus on the Democratic Front (DF) governmentâ€™s alleged culpability in the death of nearly two dozen tribal children in Thane district.

It will begin on Friday. BJP spokesman P Javadekar told reporters that the DF government was trying to cover up its failure by attributing the deaths to malnutrition.

He said that a team which visited the Khanivli area of Wada taluka, Thane, where 23 deaths were reported, had discovered that only partial grants were paid to pregnant tribal mothers last year.

Of the 607 expectant mothers, only 37 received the full grant and 307 others got a partial grant.

2,IA flouted rules in Rane case,"MUMBAI: Indian Airlines (IA) has apparently flouted rules by allowing Mr Sanjay Kaje, the personal security officer of Narayan Rane, to check-in his pistol and ammunition on a Chennai-Mumbai flight on August 16, 2002, without a letter of authority from the agency in Mumbai which had issued the weapon.

This letter has to be attached to the weapon carriage authorisation form also known as the movement control order.

Airport sources said this was a mandatory requirement laid down by the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS).

â€œIt is surprising that IA let Mr Kaje fly with his weapon in the planeâ€™s baggage hold without the relevant papers. This is a serious security lapse and the BCAS is probing into it,â€™â€™ an airport official stated.

Mr Rane and Mr Kaje were earlier booked to travel by a Jet Airways flight from Chennai to Mumbai on that day. However, the airlineâ€™s area manager (security) Vasant Kumar did not permit Mr Kaje to check-in his weapon in the aircraftâ€™s baggage hold since he did not have the necessary documents.

He later paid the price for sticking to the rules. The airline management terminated his services on August 30.

Mr Rane and Mr Kaje were subsequently accommodated on an IA flight to Mumbai.

3,Cong ministers object to Adik’s remarks,"MUMBAI: Eleven Congress ministers called on chairman of the coordination committee S B Chavan and complained against MPCC president Govindrao Adik for his statement criticising Congress ministers for their 'lack of performance'.Mr Chavan gave a patient hearing to these ministers and asked them not to take the matter to the media. These ministers include transport minister Shivajirao Moghe, labour minister Satish Chaturvedi, law minister Vilaskaka Patil, junior home minister, Kripashankar Singh, junior industries minister Prakash Awade and others. Significantly, all of them are staunch supporters of chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh. The CM and Mr Adik are at loggerheads with each other. The CM's camp is trying to remove Mr Adik from the MPCC presidentship and replace him with Mr Moghe who belongs to the tribal community from Yavatmal district.They strongly objected to a statement made by Mr Adik at a training camp organised by the AICC in Nagpur for explaining the intricacies of Panchayat Raj administration. Mr Deshmukh and senior Congress activist Mani Shankar Aiyar were among those present.According to these ministers Mr Adik said the party cannot depend on the performance of the Democratic Front government to seek votes in the next assembly elections since the performance of many ministers was not up to the mark.We will have to depend on the ideology of the Congress and its glorious past to seek votes during the next elections,'' Mr Adik said. These ministers held a meeting on Wednesday night and decided to take up the issue with Mr Chavan who has been appointed as the chairman of the committee formed to ensure coordination between the government and the party.These ministers called on Mr Chavan and expressed their anguish and hurt due to Mr Adik's criticism against their performance. "" If the president of the party accuses us of non-performance how can we function?'' they asked Mr Chavan.Mr Chavan promised them to take up the issue with Mr Adik and Mr Deshmukh. The CM's camp has decided to capitalise on Mr Adik's statement and embarrass him.Mr Adik had launched a scathing attack on the CM's camp when 11 independent MLAs, including nine ministers had issued a statement warning the party high command against removing Mr Deshmukh.Mr Adik and his supporters complained to the party high command that the CM was using these independent ministers to black-mail the leadership into retaining him in office.As part of his on going efforts to bring Mr Adik and Mr Deshmukh closer, Mr Chavan hosted a dinner for Mr Deshmukh and Mr Adik at 'Sagar', which is the official bungalow of his son, Ashok, who is the revenue minister, on Thursday night. A similar dinner hosted by him earlier had yielded no results.

4,Sena leader’s arrest a drama: Dipankar,"PATNA: CPI(ML) Liberation supremo Dipankar Bhattacharya has said that the circumstances leading to the arrest of the Ranvir Sena chief Brahmeshwar Singh have left little doubt about the fact that the entire event was stage-managed.

Making his maiden comments on Singhâ€™s arrest from New Delhi, Dipankar said: â€œIt is well-known that on two earlier occasions, Brahmeshwar was let off by the police at the behest of RJD chief Laloo Yadav.

5,"File returns, govt tells IAS, IPS officers","PATNA: The state government has directed all IAS and IPS officers to submit their immovable property return (IPR) statement for the last three financial years at the earliest.

Reminding the IAS and IPS officers that the submission of annual IPR statement was mandatory under the All India Service (Conduct) Rules, 1968, the government has asked them to submit two copies of their returns for the years 1999-2000, 2000-01 and 2001-02 in the prescribed format.

The joint secretary, personnel and administrative reforms department, Bihar, Haroon Rashid, in a recent communication to all the departmental secretaries, special secretaries, additional secretaries, joint secretaries, divisional commissioners, district magistrates and deputy development commissioners, said that IAS officers often fail to follow rules while filing their IPR statements. The officers have been directed to give full details of the immovable properties owned, acquired or inherited by them.

Taking strong exception to the use of words like â€˜purvavat (as in the previous year)â€™ and â€˜yathavat (no change)â€™ by these officers in their IPR statements, the government has reminded them that the use of such words is not permissible. The state government has sent a copy of a circular, issued in June 1999, in this regard by the department of personnel and training, Government of India, to all chief secretaries. The circular clearly said that the use of words â€˜no changeâ€™, â€˜as in the previous yearâ€™, â€˜no additionâ€™ should be avoided and all details should be filled in the return.

The central circular, sent to the then chief secretary of Bihar on June 8,1999, said that under the All India Service Rules, 1968, every member of all-India Services is required to submit a copy of his annual IPR statement to the department of personnel and training through the respective state government every year.

The department of personnel and training maintains a record of IPR statements of all IAS officers irrespective of whether they are serving at the Centre or in their respective cadre. The central circular said that after the perusal of the records maintained by the personnel and training department, it was found that some of the officers had not been filing their returns regularly.

As a result, property return folders of a large number of Bihar cadre IAS officers had remained incomplete. The director general of police, R R Prasad, said that the IPS officers have been asked to submit their annual IPR statement to the government.

6,School buses violate RTA rule on colours,"HYDERABAD: Instructions issued by the Regional Transport Authority that school buses and vehicles used by educational institutions to transport children should be painted canary yellow by August 1, 2002, have not yet been implemented by a number of schools.

The order was given by RTA joint director (transport) C L N Gandhi in the last week of June.

A senior official of the RTA told The Times of India that it has come to the RTAâ€™s notice that several schools have not made the colour change. â€œWe have booked cases against four schools. We will be booking cases against others too,â€� he added.

When contacted, the principal of a school in Jubilee Hills said he was not aware of the RTA order. This school has blue vans and buses.

â€œWe have issued orders to all schools and the newspapers have also carried this order,â€� the RTA official said. He added that most schools were avoiding getting their buses and vehicles repainted because it would cost them money.

Though the RTA wants to seize the school vehicles flouting the order, it has not done so yet, because it would put children to discomfort.

To incorporate the rule that school buses should be painted canary yellow, the RTA amended Rule 296 of the AP Motor Vehicles Rules 1989 by incorporating a new rule 296 A, Gandhi said. He added that violation of this rule would attract action under the provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act.

This rule is one of the guidelines issued by the Supreme Court about four-years ago when a school bus with 35 children fell into the river Yamuna.

7,Medical students gherao health minister,"HYDERABAD: Health minister N Janardhana Reddy â€” who was disappointed at the poor turnout at the Osmania Medical College auditorium during the felicitation of retired government doctors on Thursday â€” was caught unawares when over 100 medical students gheraoed him after the function demanding better hostel and mess facilities.

The health minister, who was heading for another meeting after the function, was forced by the students to inspect the men''s hostel toilets and the mess.

On inspection of the hostel premises, the healht minister found the drainage pipes leaking, besides most of the bathrooms with improper functioning flushes and leaking ceilings. Overhead tanks were old with faulty valves due to which water overflowed and moistened the ceiling and walls.

The students took the minister to the mess where it was filled with stink from a poor drainage facility. The students, who were led by K Rajashekar and hostel secretary Ujjal Raj, wanted reconstruction of mess ceiling, repair of the old hostel that was crumbling at certain places, repair of the entire drainage system, renovation of water pipelines and overhead tanks, repair of taps and wash basins.

Visibly disturbed by the poor conditions of the hostel and mess and also by the unexpected confrontation by the students, the health minister, after inspection, said: â€œThe condition at the premises is so bad that it is a surprise that students are still studying and residing in the hostelâ€�.

The health minister promised students that all necessary steps will be taken immediately to improve conditions at the hostel, including the mess. He also agreed to meet the students'' representatives later in the evening to work out the modalities.

Earlier, the health minister felicitated retired government doctors including former principal of Osmania Medical College Ferhana Osmania, former additional superintendent of Osmania General Hospital (OGH) Dr P Balamba and former superintendent of OGH Dr T S S Laxmi.

8,NHRC takes up cause of 'Musahars' with govt,"NEW DELHI: The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has decided to take up the pitiable condition of Musahars (rat-eaters) in Bihar with the state government and the Union social justice ministry.

The move comes in the wake of a research done by the A N Sinha Institute of Social Studies, Patna, and sponsored by the NHRC.

The final report submitted on May 17 recommends that an all-round integrated development programme is required to bring in socio-economic changes among the Musahars. But the report says changes should be brought in consultation with the community members.

The most important suggestion made by the institute is that bhoodan land and surplus land be distributed among Musahars.

The report suggests that social forestry be introduced on a priority basis within a given time-frame as the soil and climate of the areas where the Musahars live is conducive for planting coconut, palm and date trees. This will enable them to earn a livelihood.

A training programme in the field of agriculture has also been recommended. Also, there is a proposal for employment generation and emphasis has been placed on vocational programmes.

12,Pak role in J&K violence to feature in PM-Bush talks,"NEW DELHI: Pakistan''s failure to honour its pledge to end cross-border terrorism and its dubious role in the run-up to elections in Jammu and Kashmir are among the issues expected to figure when Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee meets US President George Bush in New York on September 12.

India''s case for permanent membership in the UN Security Council will also come up for discussions between the two.

Besides meeting Bush on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly session, Vajpayee, who is leaving for New York on September 9, will have bilateral talks with leaders of a dozen countries including Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, South Africa, Japan and Mauritius but any meeting with Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf is ruled out, official sources here said on Friday.

During his parleys with them, Vajpayee will reinforce India''s concerns on the continuing cross-border terrorism and Pakistan''s attempts to disrupt the ensuing polls in J and K.

Vajpayee will address the UN General Assembly a day after meeting Bush. New Delhi''s concerns over the cross border terrorism will find place in his address to the world body.

The Prime Minister, who reaches New York on September 10, will attend the commemorative function organised there on September 11 in memory of those who lost their lives in the terrorist attack on the World Trade Centre on this day in 2001.

Along with other special invites, Vajpayee will light a candle at a memorial for the victims. He is also expected to meet a number of relatives of Indians who died in the attack.

In his address to the UN, Vajpayee is likely to underpin the importance of international community taking necessary steps to fully implement UN Security Council resolution 1373 which makes it mandatory for member countries to eliminate all forms of terrorism including action against sponsors.

New Delhi has contended that Pakistan has failed to implement the resolution by continuing to promote terrorism in J and K as also provide safe haven to terrorists in that country.

India is likely to stress the importance of fighting terrorism comprehensively and not confining to ""region or religion"" and press home the point that this fight should be sustained till the menace is totally eliminated.

The Prime Minister''s delegation will include External Affairs Minister Yashwant Sinha, National Security Adviser Brajesh Mishra, Foreign Secretary Kanwal Sibal, India''s Ambassador in US Lalit Mansingh and the country''s permanent representative in UN Vijay Nambiar.

On the US offer of advanced sensors to monitor infiltration, the sources said that a pilot project would be launched soon to determine from various proposals which was the best suited for Indian conditions.

The sources made it clear that such sensors would not be operated and tested on the Line of Control but would be put to test in mountainous terrains and riverine areas. A decision on their procurement would be taken after all aspects of the tests were examined.

The Prime Minister would renew India''s strong demand for expansion of both permanent and non-permanent seats in the UN Security Council.

New Delhi has contended that by any objective criteria of the country''s size and population as also its contribution to the UN including its peacekeeping operations, its claim for permanent membership should be accepted.

""Though there are many difficulties on the way to achieving this, it is a priority issue for us,"" the sources said.

The situation in Iraq is also expected to figure prominently during UN session.

While opposing any armed action against Iraq on the ground that it would be counter-productive and not result in the resolution of current problems faced by Baghdad, India has maintained that such moves would only aggravate the sufferings of the Iraqi people. It supports the implementation of UN resolutions including action on it by Baghdad.

On his way to New York, Vajpayee will have a halt at Frankfurt and on his return journey, he will have a stop-over at Zurich on September 16.

Vajpayee is expected to discuss rehabilitation and reconstruction of Afghanistan during his meeting with its President Hamid Karzai.

A meeting is also being convened by the United Nations to take stock of the situation in Afghanistan which will be attended by about 15 countries including India, Japan and Germany, the sources said.

After addressing the UN General Assembly, Vajpayee will meet representatives of Gopio (Global Organisation of People of Indian Origin) and Aapi (American Association of Physicians of Indian Origin).

Indian Ambassador in US Lalit Mansingh will host a reception in the Prime Minister''s honour to enable him meet members of the Indian community.

On September 14, Vajpayee is expected to meet senators and congressmen of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.

He will attend a commemorative function at Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan in the evening and address a public meeting organised by Indian organisations. The focus of the Vidya Bhavan function will be the messages of Swami Vivekananda. He will also release a book on the occasion.

13,Advani wants law changed to ban cow slaughter,"NEW DELHI: Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani on Friday emphasised on the need to have a constitution amendment for a complete ban on cow slaughter as the existing law was not comprehensive.

Inaugurating a two-day conference and exhibition on the usefulness of the cow in the economy of the nation at the Indian Institute of Technology here, he said Article 48 of the constitution ""should have been more comprehensive in its scope"" on the subject.

Highlighting the need for such a ban, he said it was reverence and faith which was most essential for having such a law.

Citing Article 48, he said it had spelt out that the state shall endeavour to organise agriculture and animal husbandry on modern and scientific lines and shall take steps for preserving and improving the breeds as also prohibiting the slaughter of cow and calves and all milch and draught animals.

He said the need for cow protection was not merely because the animal was useful from the economic point of view but also it had a special place in Indian tradition.

He said the cow was not only revered by the people as part of ""Bharatiyita"" (Indianness) but from time immemorial it had played a major role in the nation''s economy.

14,Gulam Nabi Azad threatens to sue J&K govt,"SRINAGAR: Alleging that the state government has not provided security to most of the party candidates, Jammu and Kashmir Congress chief Gulam Nabi Azad on Friday threatened to sue the government if any of them was harmed during campaigning.

Azad said the National Conference government would be held directly responsible for any harm to Congress candidates. ""The BJP-led NDA government at the Centre also cannot simply wash off its hands,"" he added.

""If the state government is not acting (on the directions of the Election Commission), the Centre can definitely intervene,"" he said, adding ""the NDA government is going all over the world praising the state government.""

15,Congress releases manifesto for J&K polls,"JAMMU: The Congress on Friday promised to initiate a ""comprehensive dialogue"" with the Centre to evolve a package for greater and meaningful autonomy and removal of regional imbalances.

Releasing its manifesto for the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly elections, the Congress said it would remove regional imbalances by setting up development boards and establishing a state finance commission to ensure adequate resources to the three regions. Full powers would be given to the autonomous Hill Council for Ladakh.

It also assures the electorate of a special campaign to bring back Kashmiri Pandits to the state, a comprehensive relief and rehabilitation package for those affected by terrorist violence, alternate land to those families uprooted from border areas due to Pakistani shelling and scheduled tribe status to Pahari speaking people.

Releasing the manifesto, state Congress chief Gulam Nabi Azad said, ""These elections will provide an opportunity to the people to vote for better future where security of life and property of every citizen will be assured and a future in which composite traditions of the state are preserved, protected and promoted.""

Large turnout in the polls would send a signal to the militants and all those who do not want return of peace and normalcy. It would also provide an opportunity to the people to reject those who betrayed their hopes and aspirations and failed to provide a clean administration, Azad added.

19,Non-Karunakaran factions rally behind Antony,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: With factional wrangles in the Congress in Kerala soaring over the power tariff hike muddle, the non-Karunakaran camps have rallied behind Chief Minister A K Antony, asserting that any attempt to score factional points by isolating him would be foiled.

Close on the heels of the UDF government rolling back the power tariff hike in view of the ''public outcy'', Finance Minister K Sanakaranarayanan and Information Minister M M Hassan held that ""attempts by certain quarters to hold Antony alone responsible for the power hike are deplorable.""

Karunakaran had not only opposed the hike, but also seized on the rollback as another opportunity to hit out at Antony, saying that the whole turn of events was due to the government''s failure to gauge the public mood before pushing a key decision like power tariff hike.

While reversing the hike, Antony had admitted that not only the opposition, but even sections in the Congress had come out openly against the hike.

Antony, who had so far refused to be provoked by Karunakaran''s criticism, this time sought to turn the tables on his senior colleague by asking ""Has he ever said anything good about the government. Does anybody expect such a thing from him?""

Sankaranarayanan, a senior cabinet member, said ""Those trying to isolate Antony will only get themselves isolated,"" as it was was by projecting Antony as the leader that the Congress-led UDF had come to power in the last assembly polls.

Hassan said ""Those trying to find fault with Antony should in fact take him as a role model in democracy.""

It was not under opposition pressure that the government had withdrawn the hike in toto, but in deference to sentiments of the people who gave an overwhelming mandate to the UDF, he said.

G Karthikeyan, Food Minister and leader of the ''third group'' in the Congress, too came out in support of Antony, asserting that the withdrawal of the price hike was not a setback to the government.

By reversing the decision, the government had only shown respect to the public feeling, he said, adding that there was no justification for finding fault only with the Chief Minister.

21,Oppn slam govt for not submitting drought report,"AMBALA: Leader of Opposition in the state assembly and senior Congress leader Bhupinder Singh Hooda said here on Friday that it was unfortunate that the state government, as per a statement of Union agriculture minister Ajit Singh, had not sent any report about drought losses to the Union government so far.

â€˜â€˜This is despite the fact that Haryana was the worst-affected from drought,â€™â€™ he added.

â€˜â€˜At a time when the drought-hit farmers are suffering, Chautala, instead of persuading the Union government for assistance, has left for foreign trip along with his MLAs. Such type of anti-farmer government has no right to stay in power,â€™â€™ he said.

Replying to a question, he said that the Congress could not raise several important issues of public interest in the recently concluded assembly session as the Speaker did not accept the adjourned motion placed by Congress.

Moreover, many call-attention motions sent by the Congress MLAs were also rejected. â€˜â€˜In fact, the government could not accumulate the courage to face the Opposition,â€™â€™ he said.

He demanded that the government give compensation of Rs 10,000 per acre to the affected farmers. â€˜â€˜The state government has played a cruel joke with farmers by declaring subsidy on the purchase of seeds when the sowing season has passed,â€™â€™ he said.

Hooda said it was surprising that North Haryana had not been considered drought-hit. He alleged that as many as 1,000 villages in the state were facing water crisis.

25,"Now, farmers to pay Rs 2 per unit of power","CHANDIGARH: The regime of free power for farmers in Punjab came to an end on Friday with the Punjab State Electricity Regulatory Commission (PSERC) ordering a tariff of Rs two per unit of power for agricultural power (AP) users.

The order of the commission, given with retrospective effect from August 1, stated that AP users be charged Rs two per unit in case of metered users or Rs 212 per British Horse Power (BHP) per month in case of unmetered supply. If the government decides to pay subsidy for the supply to AP users from its coffers, the tariff will be 57 paise per unit or Rs 60 per BHP per month.

The tariff structure approved by the commission had been proposed by the Punjab State Electricity Board (PSEB) and was not opposed by the state government in its response to the commission.

The commission, however, left the threat of reduction in tariff for AP users hanging on the PSEB and in its order stated that, â€˜â€˜In the years to come, if the quality of power supplied to AP users remains as poor, the commission may work out a suitable formula for appropriate compensation for the AP set users. The burden of this will have to be shared by the utility and consumers.â€�

Given the situation prevailing in the state, the commission has opted for a flat rate system (Rs 212 per BHP per month in case of unmetered supply), but at the same time it has directed the PSEB to prepare a plan for gradual shift from the flat rate system to metered supply and submit the plan to the commission at the earliest.

The commission had enquired from the state government its willingness to extend subsidy to AP set users and domestic categories.

The state government had replied that it would be in a position to extend a subsidy to the tune of Rs 800 crore during the current year. This includes the retention of electricity duty by the PSEB and adjustment of interest due to the state government by the PSEB.

After imposing tariff on farmers, the net revenue expected from this is Rs 297 crore, a paltry sum compared to the annual revenue requirement of the PSEB, which stands at 6,341 crore. This figure is based on the sale power by the board for 2002-03, as approved the commission.

26,Sena demands arrest of sugar co-op directors,"MUMBAI: The Shiv Sena has demanded the arrest of a dozen exporters and directors of about 14 co-operative sugar factories who had allegedly colluded in diverting sugar meant for export to the domestic market. The directorate of revenue intelligence is already investing the scam.

The commissioner of sugar has confirmed the scam, though his office is still to find out the full extent of the scandal. According to Sena MLC Kanaiyalal Gidwani about three lakh tonnes of sugar has been illegally diverted by a cartel of exporters and sugar factory directors to make use of the price difference between the export and domestic markets.

He alleged that this cartel has made about Rs 80 crores illegally. He said the diversion was done without the sanction of the authorities concerned and no central excise duty was paid which resulted in a huge revenue loss to the government. The export price was Rs 10,500 per tonne, while the local rate was Rs 13,000 per tonne. He said the farmers, who were members of the cooperative sugar factories, were deprived of their dues. During the monsoon session of the legislature, the state government had confirmed that about 2.28 lakh tonnes of sugar was illegally diverted.

27,"As Cauvery protests escalate, state awaits CRA meet","NEW DELHI\MANDYA\MYSORE: As protests intensified on Friday -- the third day of water release to Tamil Nadu -- Karnataka is still awaiting an appointment with Prime Minister A.B. Vajpayee for an immediate Cauvery River Authority (CRA) meeting.

With 3.75 tmcft already on its way to Mettur from the Kabini dam, as per the Supreme Court order, Chief Minister S.M. Krishna told reporters at Delhi airport: ``We cannot be expected to release water to TN indefinitely.''''

Krishna -- who rushed to Delhi with Water Resources Minister H.K. Patil and Law Minister D.B. Chandre Gowda -- said CRA had to be convened ``immediately'''' to assess water availability in Cavuery basin reservoirs as against Karnataka''s irrigation and drinking water requirements. ``I am making a last ditch attempt to impress our case before the PM leaves for his nine-day foreign tour,'''' he admitted.

On TN CM Jayalalithaa''s stand that the Cauvery Monitoring Committee meeting on Saturday was itself ``fishy,'''' and her statement that Cauvery water had still not reached TN, Krishna merely said: ``It takes two days for water to reach Mettur.''''

Away from the political heat of the capital, farmers courted arrest at the KRS and Kabini dams, threw furniture and files out of the executive engineer''s office and locked the doors of the Water Resources Department office. Over 140 agitators were arrested and later released at H.D. Kote town.

Road traffic between Bangalore and Mysore was paralysed for the second day, with farmers, students and others squatting on the highway. Bangalore-bound Tippu Express and Shatabdi from Chennai were stopped at the Mandya station for over 30 minutes.

Vehicular movement came to a complete halt in T. Narsipur taluk, which is entirely dependent on Kabini waters. Farmers leaders said a massive protest rally would be held at the Command Area Development Authority offices in Mysore on Saturday.

In Mandya, two separate rallies led by Film star and Congress MP Ambaraish and former Congress MP G. Made Gowda marched to the Deputy Commissioner''s officer to submit protest memoranda. A relay hunger strike has started, with MLC M.S. Siddaraju and other JD(S) leaders participating, while a Mandya district bandh has been called on Saturday.

Keragodu, Koppa and Killara towns held bandhs on Friday. KSRTC buses between Mandya and Mysore were cancelled. All schools, central and state government offices in the district remained closed.

Made Gowda -- President of Mandya District Raitha Hitharakshana Samithi --mooted the idea of ``KRS Chalo,'''' where one lakh people gather at the dam to bring pressure against release of any more water. All trains between Bangalore and Mysore would be stopped on Sunday, he added.

Ambarish told a rally that Krishna would be ready for ``any sacrifice'''' to safeguard farmers'' interests. ``If the PM does injustice to our farmers, the Central Government will not survive,'''' he warned.

28,More delays in policy decisions,"NEW DELHI: Making laws has never been easy. Now, the Centreâ€™s missive â€” which has triggered off a power tussle between the Delhi and Union governments â€” is likely to make the already complicated journey more tortuous.

Letâ€™s retrace the law-making process. It starts with the state government deciding that a new law is needed for the city.

Orders are dashed off to the department concerned, which is asked to frame the law. This outline is then sent to the state governmentâ€™s law department which adds details and gives it the shape of a Bill. The Bill is then sent back to the state cabinet to be introduced in the Assembly.

It is here that the Centreâ€™s missive has added one more step. According to the Delhi state government, the Centre wants that a Bill be first sent to the Lieutenant-Governor (L-G) before being introduced in the Assembly.

The L-G will send the Bill to the Union home ministry and after consultation will decide whether the Bill is fit to be introduced in the Assembly.

This, argue MLAs, means the Centre will now decide whether they can even introduce a Bill or not. This strips the Delhi Assembly of its fundamental right to make laws, they claim. There is another bone of contention. The missive states that Bills being introduced by the Delhi government will now be called â€˜â€˜legislative proposalsâ€™â€™. What is a legislative proposal?

Delhi MLAs claim the term is not defined in the Constitution. A Bill, they argue, has some constitutional sanctity. It is clearly defined how a Bill will move, who has the power to question it and how it can become a law. Will a proposal have the same sanctity?

MLAs fear in case the L-G decides that a â€˜â€˜proposalâ€™â€™ is not good enough, he may simply discard it and the cityâ€™s elected representatives can do nothing about it.

Even if he recommends its introduction in the Assembly and the proposal is passed in the House, it will still not become a law. The proposal will again be sent back to the L-G for another round of clearance.

The L-G can, if he wants, revert the proposal back to the Assembly. In the best scenario, he can forward it for the Presidentâ€™s consent.

â€˜â€˜How many times does a proposal or a Bill have to go to the L-G? After all, he decides what we introduce in the Assembly. Why does he have to re-examine the same proposal? If he has to do everything on his own, what are the elected representatives going to do?â€™â€™ questioned an MLA.

29,2 govt officials held for graft after 11 yrs,"NEW DELHI: Eleven years after an assistant engineer and a junior engineer of the flood control department of Delhi administration took a bribe of Rs 1,800 from a local contractor, a city court has sentenced the duo to two yearsâ€™ rigorous imprisonment (RI).

Special judge P K Bhasin, who found assistant engineer Vivek Kumar Dutta and junior engineer Dinesh Chand Garg guilty under Prevention of Corruption Act, also slapped a fine of Rs 5,000 on both. In case of failure to pay the fine, the RI would be extended by six months.

The case dates backs to September 20, 1991, when Kailash Chand Gupta who worked as a contractor with the department, lodged a complaint with the anti-corruption branch of CBI.

30,‘No speech’ invite upsets law ministers,"NEW DELHI: In what can be perceived as an open confrontation between the judiciary and the executive, Union law minister Jana Krishnamurty and his deputy Ravi Shankar Prasad boycotted the inaugural function of the National Judicial Academy established under the aegis of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.

The academy was inaugurated by President Kalam in Bhopal on Thursday and the review session of NJAâ€™s course on gender and law by Chief Justice B N Kirpal

Sources say, â€˜â€˜There is some dignity attached to the office of the law minister. Therefore, they decided to boycott the function.â€™â€™ Sources added,â€˜â€˜What upset the two ministers is the way the invitation card sent by Chief Justice Kirpal ignored them.

""Apart from Kalam, the organisers had requested MP governor Bhai Mahavir, the chief justice and chief minister Digvijay Singh to give speeches. The law minister and his deputy, despite being invited, were not among the speakers.â€™â€™
