1,Security major issue in polls: Rana,"VADODARA: ""Security"" and all aspects related to it will be a major issue to be taken up by the BJP in Assembly polls, said state BJP president Rajendrasinh Rana while speaking to newsmen here on Wednesday.

Rana was in the city to attend a meeting of senior western region party functionaries.

Rana said the issue would be treated as something that affects all walks of life. ""We will talk about the security in all aspects of a common man''s life. This will be our main issue for the polls,"" Rana said.

BJP national general secretary Pyarelal Khandelwal hinted at early Assembly polls, but said the state government had to take a decision in this regard. ""It is very likely that the Assembly polls will be before time. However, a decision regarding this has to be taken by the state government,"" he said.

Commenting on the party''s expectations regarding the timings of the poll, Khandelwal said the party was prepared for the polls ""even today"". ""The exact time-table for the polls, however, will have to be decided by the election commission,"" he said.

Khandelwal also made it clear that the polls in the state will be contested under the leadership of Chief Minister Narendra Modi. ""This is understood and I need not comment on it. Modi has been made the chief minister only sometime back,"" he said.

Khandelwal came down heavily on the Opposition for changing its stance on elections frequently. ""Earlier, they were demanding the resignation of the government and polls. When the BJP working committee in Goa indicated at early polls, they started criticising us. Now, they are demanding polls once again,"" he said.

BJP functionaries said the meeting discussed the current political scenario in the states of Gujarat, Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Goa. The results of Goa Assembly polls, fluid political situation in Maharashtra and the ensuing polls for Rajasthan as well as Gujarat assemblies were discussed threadbare, sources said.

Sources added that stress was also laid on strengthening the organisational machinery in these states. Also, the leaders discussed the golden jubilee celebrations of the establishment of the party.

2,New ministers deny split in BSP,"PATNA: In a further twist to the turn of events, all the three newly inducted ministers in the Rabri Devi government â€” Mahabali Singh, Rajesh Singh and Chhedi Paswan â€” have, in a joint statement, denied that they have split up the BSP, saying that they have joined the coalition ministry in their capacity as BSP legislators.

This assertion on the part of the three BSP MLAs has caused an embarrassment to RJD supremo Laloo Prasad Yadav who had publicly stated that the BSP had split up. It has also resulted in a setback to Lalooâ€™s reported efforts to split up the BSP.

The Congress, a major partner in the RJD-led coalition government, has already protested against the induction of the BSP MLAs into the ministry on Tuesday because of the BSPâ€™s alliance with the BJP in UP. When AICC general secretary in charge of Bihar affairs Oscar Fernandes and BPCC chief Shakeel Ahmad lodged the protest, Laloo clearly told them that the three legislators had been inducted into the ministry following a split in the BSP.

In the hard-hitting joint statement, the three newly inducted ministers have sharply reacted to Lalooâ€™s reported statement about the â€œnon-existenceâ€� of the BSP in Bihar.

Criticising the RJD chief for making such a statement, they said, â€œLaloo Yadav is misleading the people by spreading the canard about a split in the BSP.â€� The BSP, they maintained, represents the poor and downtrodden as well as the minorities and would continue to highlight the peopleâ€™s problems and agitate for the mitigation of their sufferings.

Many other BSP leaders, including Zakir Hussain, Suresh Pasi (both MLAs) and Chandrika Das, the state general secretary of the party, decried Lalooâ€™s statement and said none of the BSP legislators would join the RJD.

The BSP has decided to hold dharnas at all district headquarters on July 5 in protest against the â€œatrocities on the weaker sections of societyâ€�. The state-level dharna will be held here on July 10 at the I-T roundabout, they added.

Incidentally, BSP state vice-president F A Khan, who was among those who criticised Laloo earlier in the day, was purpoted to have joined the RJD late in night. His statement, along with a release on the portfolio distribution to the ministers, was delivered in newspapersâ€™ offices by a PRD offical.

While Mahabali has been given the road construction department, Rajesh Singh has been allotted transport department and Chhedi Paswan rural development department. Also, rural development minister Awadh Bihari Chaudhary has been given additional charge of transport ministry while parliamentary affairs minister Ramchandra Purvey has been given additional charge of minor irrigation.

The RJD circles asserted that the three new ministers will join the RJD soon.

Although the state leadership of the BSP, including the newly inducted ministers, is denying any split in the party, its central leadership is yet to make any definite statement on the state of the party in Bihar.

Meanwhile, Laloo has reportedly decided to allot the plum portfolio of minor irrigation to cabinet minister Mahabali Singh.

Ministers of state Rajesh Singh and Chhedi Paswan are expected to get animal husbandry and co-operative departments, said RJD sources.
