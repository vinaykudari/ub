0,Vaghela gets bigger with ministerial berth,"AHMEDABAD: If there was anybody from Gujarat who was sure of making to the Union ministry, it was Shankersinh Vaghela.

There would be many in the BJP, of course, who would be squirming at the prospect of him landing with some important ministry, wherein they will now have to approach him for seeking any assistance towards the state.

His revolt against the BJP in the mid-90 still rankles the saffron leaders.Even till today, both Narendra Modi and Vaghela refuse to share a public platform, and figure against each other in many a television shows.

Congressmen, however, feel Vaghela as a Union minister would not only keep dissidence in the Gujarat Congress at bay, but he could actually use his newly-acquired muscle against the BJP now.

A masters in economics from the Gujarat University,Vaghela was elected to the Lok Sabha first in 1977, then in 1989, 1991, 1999 and again in 2004. He became a force to reckon with in Gujarat when he challenged Suresh Mehta''s BJP government in 1996 by whisking away some MLAs to Khajuraho, dismantling the government, and launching the Rashtriya Janata Party (RJP) to assume power as chief minister in a Congress-supported government.

The episode which launched a third force in Gujarat, remains a nightmare for the BJP which got ridden with factionalism with members being tagged as ""Khajuria"" or moderates (for Vaghela loyalists) and ""Hajuria"" (extremists) for Keshubhai Patel loyalists. The RJP, however,was a short-lived experience when in December 1999 Vaghela, in yet another strategic move, merged his party with the Congress.

Appointed president of the Gujarat PCC over a year back, he was held responsible for the Congress'' debacle in the assembly elections of December 2002. His detractors, from the original Congress, in an agitation led by Congress legislature party leader Amarsinh Chaudhary, refused to sit quiet and had him dislodged a couple of months before the Lok Sabha elections.

As an MP, he has been on the consultative committee for ministry of petroleum and chemicals twice, besides other committees. Today, Vaghela is having the last laugh as he emerges the most formidable among the Congress list of MPs to be chosen for ministership.

1,Regional parties have a party,"NEW DELHI: The government''s new and different impulses are likely to come from the huge regional party contingent, other than the lady behind the throne, Sonia.

The other story of Manmohan''s council is the regional parties; they''ve walked away with the lion''s share, indicating that Congress has been a generous coalition leader. Tamil Nadu has a largest contingent, a full dozen. Bihar comes next with 10, followed by Maharashtra with 8 and Andhra Pradesh with 4. In other words, wherever Congress has found partners, it has had to pay back with ministerial berths.

In the process, Manmohan''s council has underscored the marginalisation of Uttar Pradesh in this election. In all, the state with 80 MPs has two ministers, the same as Delhi with 7 MPs. Karnataka is another loser: it has no one in the Cabinet. Of its four ministers, one is a minister of state with independent charge, and the remaining three plain vanilla MOSs.

In the glam quota, there is one cine star â€” Sunil Dutt. But he''s a veteran MP, winning the Bombay North seat five times. That''s why he has got a Cabinet berth. There''s another super star of a different sort in the Cabinet â€” Laloo Prasad Yadav. Apparently, Yadav fought a valiant battle with his Bihar ally, Ram Vilas Paswan, to have taken a lead for the railways portfolio.

2,Man still a partyman,"NEW DELHI: PM Manmohan Singh seemed to be pretty clear on the importance of the party. Soon after taking oath, he drove down to 10 Janpath to discuss the allocation of portfolios among Congress claimants.

The new-found clout of the organisation vis-a-vis the government was also evident when Ambika Soni turned down the offer of a ministerial berth. Though her â€œsacrificeâ€� had partly to do with the compulsion to appease a sulking Ram Vilas Paswan, Soni wrote to Sonia saying she had been inspired by the Congress chief''s ""unique example"". The popular estimate, however, was that Soni should have no regrets, since being a member of Sonia''s secretariat she will be invested with more power than she could have hoped to wield as a member of the Manmohan ministry.

While the PMO''s authority has often helped graft a larger-than-life persona on the incumbents, the difference in stature between Sonia and Manmohan is considered to be too wide to be bridged with the help of official accoutrements.

4,"Bansal misses Cabinet ride, party upset","CHANDIGARH: Non-inclusion of the lone member of Parliament from Chandigarh, Pawan Kumar Bansal, in the Union council of ministers sworn-in on Saturday has come as a jolt to the local unit of the Congress.

Bansal was widely believed to be a frontrunner for a ministerial berth, having had a long innings (16 years) in Parliament.

Reacting to his non-inclusion, Bansal told TNN on phone from New Delhi that considering his long representation of the party in Parliament â€œof course there was the natural expectancy of finding a berth in the ministry,â€� but â€œit is the prerogative of the Prime Minister and the CPP leader and I have no regrets.â€�

On being asked whether the large number of berths gobbled up by the allies had anything to do with the decision, Bansal''s emphatic reply was â€œI don''t think so.â€�

While Bansal was not very optimistic about a cabinet expansion in the near future because of the 68 ministers already having been inducted, state party president B B Behl was very confident that Bansal would find a place in an expansion. Congress mayor Kamlesh and senior deputy mayor Pradeep Chhabra appeared to be clearly disappointed at his non-inclusion.

5,Concern over species' extinction,"LUCKNOW: As the world celebrates International Biodiversity Day, the world faces the threat of losing some of the exquisite and essential species of flora and fauna.

This aspect was highlighted in the seminar titled ""Biodiversity: Food, Water, Health for all"".

Addressing the seminar, chief guest and environment minister Ram Pyare Singh, said that science had proved a boon as well as a bane.

""We do not have patience. We want to fulfil all our wishes at once. We don''t think before doing something. We are not farsighted and look at present gains only. Population growth is one of the main reasons that have adversely affected environment,"" said Singh.

P Pushpangadan, director, NBRI gave instances of natural disasters that occurred due to man''s exploitation of nature.

""The smog in London that killed many was due to people''s neglect. Acid rain experienced in Mexico was due to human intervention. If we conserve, protect and have sustainable development, we may avoid such disasters,"" said Pushpangadan.

Educational and informative ''scientoons'' were displayed by PK Srivastav, scientist, CDRI, who gave startling facts regarding destruction of nature and biodiversity. Climatic changes are the worst phenomena being experienced at present.

6,Interest rates of domestic term deposits dip: RBI policy,"MUMBAI: The interest rates on term deposits of public sector banks have dipped in the range of 0.25 per cent to 1.25 per cent at the end of April 2004 compared to the previous financial year.

The term deposit rates of public sector banks for maturities up to one year moved down from a range of 4-6 per cent in March 2003 to 3.75-5.25 per cent by April 2004, according to Reserve Bank of India''s annual policy for FY-05.

Similarly, interest rates on term deposits over one-year have declined from a range of 5.25-7.00 per cent to 5.00-5.75 per cent during the period, it said.

During 2003-04, the spread between typical deposit rates of tenor of 15-29 days and over three years offered by public sector banks remained unchanged at 175 basis points.

""Overall, there has been a considerable flattening of the term structure of deposit rates during the last three years"". RBI pointed out.

The central bank said ""despite a fall in deposit rates and lowering of the cost of funds, the range of Prime Lending Rates (PLRs) of public sector banks remained sticky.""

In view of the downward stickiness of PLRs, the scheme of Benchmark PLR (BPLR) was mooted in the annual policy Statement of April 2003 to address the need for transparency in banks lending rates as also to reduce the complexity involved in pricing of loans.

RBI said almost all commercial banks have since announced their BPLR in place of the earlier system of tenor-linked PLR.

The range of BPLR for public sector banks is lower at 10.25-11.5 per cent as compared with their earlier PLR range of 10.0-12.25 per cent.

These banks have reduced their rates by 0.25 to one per cent while announcing their BPLR. The compression in the range of PLRs of foreign and private sector banks is more evident, moving from a wide range of 6.75-17.5 per cent in March 2003 to 10.5-14.85 per cent by March 2004.

As at end-March 2004, public sector banks'' median (representative) lending rate for the demand and term loans (at which maximum business is contracted), in the range of 11.0-12.75 per cent and 11.0-13.25 per cent, respectively, exhibited some moderation as compared with their corresponding levels of 11.5-14.0 per cent and 12.0-14.0 per cent, respectively, in March 2003.

The movement in interest rates in 2003-04 corroborates the view that banks should, in their interest, take steps to build up investment fluctuation reserves (IFR) in a smooth and phased manner for better risk management.

10,"BJP targets Laloo and ""criminal"" ministers","PATNA: Criticising Prime Minister Manmohan Singh for appointing four ""tainted"" RJD ministers in his team, including the multi-crore fodder scam accused, Laloo Prasad Yadav, the BJP in Bihar on Sunday said it would launch an agitation across the state to make people aware of the ''dark'' background of the ministers.

Party workers will hold sit-in demonstrations and protest-marches in every district to protest against the inclusion of Laloo Yadav and three of his party colleagues, chargesheeted in separate criminal cases, in the Union cabinet, state party president Gopal Narayan Singh told PTI.

While the RJD president Laloo Yadav is chargesheeted by CBI in the fodder scam, Md Taslimuddin is an accused in over a dozen criminal cases, including alleged rape of a minor.

Taslimuddin was removed within a week as minister of state for Home from the United Front government headed by H D Devegowda for his criminal background.

Among two others, Jay Prakash Narayan Yadav had to resign as education minister in the Rabri Devi cabinet in 2002 following his implication in the scam involving awarding of fake B.Ed degrees by some colleges of the Lalit Narayan Mithila university. He was jailed in the case.

The MP from Darbhanga, M A Fatimi, was accused of giving shelter to an aide of underworld don, Dawood Ibrahim.

Singh said that his party would make people aware of the ''dark'' background of Laloo Yadav and others and expose the Congress claim of giving a ''clean'' ministry.

The former leader of the Opposition in the Bihar assembly and newly elected BJP MP from Bhagalpur, Sushil Kumar Modi, today said that the NDA would raise the matter of removing ''tainted'' RJD ministers in the Lok Sabha and if required stall proceedings of the House.

Modi told reporters that in the wake of the fodder scam, Laloo Yadav on the direction of then Prime Minister, H D Deve Gowda, had resigned from Chief Ministership of Bihar. He is currently on bail in four cases of the fodder scam and the court''s decision could come on the issue any time.

The BJP MP said that Taslimuddin had in his affidavit admitted that there were nine crimimnal cases against him.

Cases of kidnapping and other crimes are pending against Fatimi. Besides he has been accused of having nexus with Fazlur Rahman, a close aide of the notorious gangster Dawood Ibrahim.

Modi charged that Laloo had ''blackmailed'' Congress to get ministerial berth for himself and other colleagues.

He demanded that the ''tainted'' RJD ministers be immediately sacked and party leaders having no criminal record be included in their places.
