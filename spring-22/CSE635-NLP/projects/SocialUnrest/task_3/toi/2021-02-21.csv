2,'Health policy will ease load',"CHANDIGARH: To strengthen the health care services at the peripheral level that would go a long way in cutting down on the burgeoning patient load on tertiary care hospitals, the need of the hour is the formulation of a ''Rural Health Policy''.

The policy would make it binding on MBBS passouts to be posted at rural areas which would ensure that the posts in the health centres do not lie vacant much to the chagrin of patients residing there.

Reiterating the need for a ''Rural Health Policy'', former director of All India Institute of Medical Sciences Prof P K Dave said, ""To check the ever increasing load of patients on the tertiary level hospitals like AIIMS and PGI, health services in the periphery need to be strengthened and efforts should be made to ensure that the primary health care centres have doctors on duty. Formulation of a Rural Health Policy would be of great help in checking the inflow of patients.""

He said, ""At present the state of affairs is such that even patients suffering from cough and cold rush to the tertiary level hospitals. PGI and AIIMS should ideally not be entertaining such cases and an individual should be made aware about his own responsibility about maintaining his health.""

Pressing for more autonomy for institutions like AIIMS and PGI he said, ""While accountability of doctors is a must similarly institutions like AMMS and PGI should have more autonomy.

For instance, the government can spell out the budget of a particular institute and say that the money should be utilised for construction of super speciality centres, decisions pertaining to which centres need to be created should vest with the director and his team or the institute''s governing body. Autonomy is a healthy concept for any institution.""

When asked about political interference in selection of senior professors and appointment of directors of these institutes, he, however, refrained from making comments.

Talking of disaster management, he said, ""The concept of disaster management is missing in India. It is extremely unfortunate that hospitals lack a disaster plan which is of extreme importance in times of exigencies and calamities.

In Delhi, during the recent dengue outbreak only AIIMS had a disaster plan. Every city, medical college and major hospital should have a disaster management plan which comes in handy in times of crisis be it bomb blasts, floods and earthquake.""

He also spoke about the importance of women''s education and empowerment for improving the public health of the country.

4,"Mystery of the burnt bodies solved, 6 arrested","HYDERABAD: The Cyberabad police on Saturday arrested six persons in connection with the murder of two government employees, whose bodies had been set afire at Krishna Nagar in Jeedimetla late Wednesday night.

The arrested persons have been identified as Syed Ishaq, 28, and his wife Sana, 24, both residents of Moghal Residency apartments in Tolichowki; Mir Majeed Ali, 19, and Shaik Asgar, 20, both residents of Petlaburz; Mohammed Moinuddin alias Moin, 20, a resident of Charminar area, and Syed Amjad, 18, of Puranapul. Another accused Khadeer, a resident of Petlaburz, is still at large.

Police also recovered a scooter, a gold chain, two gold rings, two wrist watches and a cell-phone from their possession.

Disclosing the arrests to media persons on Saturday, Cyberabad police commissioner M Mahender Reddy said the deceased had been identified as V Bhoomaiah, 52, senior assistant in the office of the joint director of agriculture at Nizamabad and Narasimhaswamy, 50, a senior inspector-cum-auditor at the district cooperative audit office in Chandra Vihar complex at Exhibition Grounds.

Investigations by the police revealed that Bhoomaiah''s son V Pavan Kumar came into contact with Sana,who was working as an executive with HSBC, through one of his friends. Sana and Ishaq collected Rs 1.25 lakh from Pavan, promising him a job in HSBC. The couple then began stalling the matter, prompting Bhoomaiah to mount pressure on them.

Fed up with Bhoomaiah''s taunts, the couple hatched a plan with Khadeer to eliminate Bhoomaiah. On February 15, Ishaq informed Pavan to go to Vizag saying there was a vacancy there. But Pavan found that there was no such vacancy.

On February 17, Ishaq spoke to Bhoomaiah and asked him to come to Hyderabad to discuss the matter. Bhoomaiah asked his friend Narasimhaswamy, a resident of Sanathanagar, to pick him up from the Jubilee bus station the following morning.

The duo then went to Sana''s office located in Banjara Hills. Sana informed Ishaq, who called the duo to their residence to discuss the matter.

While Bhoomaiah and Narasimhaswamy were waiting at Sana''s house, two of Ishaq''s friends entered the house posing as electricians.

They strangled Bhoomaiah and Narasimhaswamy to death with wires. In the meantime, Sana returned and Ishaq borrowed his neighbour Mohammed Khan''s Maruti van saying he had to take Sana to her relatives'' house. The bodies were then dumped into the van. Ishaq filled petrol in the van and also bought 10 litres in a plastic can. They then took the body to Jeedimetla and burnt them.

Speaking to media persons, Ishaq said that he decided to kill Bhoomaiah as the latter was threatening him and his wife with dire consequences if he failed to provide a job to the latter''s son.

""We were prepared to refund the money within 20 days, but Bhoomaiah was frequently blackmailing us. We decided to eliminate him as we could not bear the pressure he exerted on us,"" Ishaq said.
