2,"'Student leaders, political bosses told to behave'","gandhinagar: the state government said on monday that it has communicated to student organisations in universities across the state and their political patrons that it will not hesitate to use force to quell violence . referring to the attacks on vice chancellors, deans and college principals, the minister of state for home haren pandya told reporters that it was only after the state government communicated to the senior leaders affiliated to ""a certain political party"" that the violence has stopped since last few days. ""they were told in plain words that the police would be compelled to use the force if the members of the students' wing continued to indulge in violence on the campus and in the vicinity of colleges."" however, the minister did not agree to the statement made earlier by minister of state for higher education bharat barot that some ""bootleggers"" were involved in the attacks on the campus and at some colleges in ahmedabad. pandya made it clear that the police have found out that majority of the students leaders who were involved in the incidents have no connection with the college students and were out only to malign the bjp government. the minister said that the police did not interfere till the demonstrations were peaceful but had to enter the scene as some college principals were thrashed up by some miscreants. he asserted that the government would not tolerate violence any more, disclosing that adequate police force have been deployed in the campus to prevent recurrence of ugly incidents. earlier, while talking to reporters, education and information minister bharat barot had alleged that the violence was perpetrated by some bootleggers and the students should not be blamed. the law will take its own course, he added.

3,HCL staff stage dharna to protest privatisation,"hyderabad: employees of hindustan cables limited (hcl) on tuesday staged a dharna here to protest the privatisation of the public sector company. hcl employees union president m balisetty said the bjp, which came to power by promising to create one crore jobs per year, was now resorting to downsizing of public sector units. he claimed that the company was achieving better results than the targets set in the revival package announced in 1999. ""when the company is doing well, there shouldn't be any reason to privatise it,"" he said. indian federation of trade unions (iftu) general secretary d v krishna rao said the union government was only fulfilling the wishes of the world bank and other multinational companies and had completely ignored the interests of the people of the country. he announced the iftu's support to the agitation of the hcl workers. communist party of india (cpi) city secretary azeez pasha said the privatisation of the hcl would lead to escalation of prices of communication facilities in the country. the centre for indian trade unions (citu) has also extended their support to the cause of the hcl employees, according to a press release.

4,BJP launches backward classes quota politics in UP,"new delhi: political equations are being reworked in uttar pradesh in the months before the assembly elections over the state government's promise of a job quota for the most backward castes. the ruling bjp's efforts to gain political mileage from the recent announcement will get underway on tuesday when union ministers uma bharti and ram vilas paswan join chief minister rajnath singh at a public meeting in lucknow. in an apparent attempt to divide the backward classes and win over a section of them, the bjp has planned a campaign on the issue of the mbc quota. the lucknow show, billed as a thanks-giving meeting, is, in fact, seen as a prelude to the poll campaign. the presence of bharti, one of the most prominent backward politicians in the bjp fold, will clearly acquire unmistakable political overtones. she has reportedly been instructed by her party leadership to get active in the up campaign apparently to offstage the negative impact of former chief minister kalyan singh's expulsion on the backwards. when contacted, bharti admitted as much. ``yes, i am going to campaign extensively in up,'' she told this paper. the opposition camp, however, feels that an overkill on the mbc quota issue is sure to backfire. ``a section of the backwards among whom the bjp has significant support, might veer away from the party as a reaction to the new quota politics,'' former prime minister v. p. singh remarked. the castes he declined to mention in this context, seem to be the lodhas and kurmis. singh who as prime minister had accepted the mandal commission report on obc reservations, interestingly felt that the economic issues were going to determine the political agenda in the coming years. ``the up elections will be a test case for the new kind of politics,'' he remarked. the samajwadi party which has done well in the recent by-elections in the state, sees chief minister rajnath singh's announcement of the sub-quota as an expression of ``desperation.''

6,JD(U) calls for permanent policy on drought,"bangalore: jd(u) mla c. byre gowda on wednesday demanded that a permanent national policy be formulated to deal with drought every year. participating in a discussion on drought in the assembly, gowda said each time the government changes, the same legislators talk differently. instead, if a permanent policy is framed, it will save everyone's time. in the council, m.c. nanaiah (jd) criticised the government for taking farmers for a ride by giving hollow promises and raising false hopes on waiving of penal interest. the penal interest is peanuts and does not make any substantial difference if it's waived. ``what's needed is waiver of interest and converting the loan into a soft and long-term loan.'' he took the centre to task for showing concern for big industrialists and defaulters in nationalised banks and not rushing to the rescue of farmers. the centre has earmarked rs 52,000 crore to repay banks which have been declared as non-performing assets. ``let the centre show the same concern towards farmers.'' b.l. shankar (jd) said there's nothing wrong if the entire fund earmarked for legislators is diverted for desiltation of tanks. ``the problem is lack of will and vision on the political leadership's part mixed with lethargy and too much dependence on bureaucracy whose commitment is skin-deep,'' he declared. p. ramaiah (nominated) emphasised for a permanent mechanism to monitor drought. ``the need of the hour is to create fodder bank and drinking water to both cattle and meaningful implementation of employment assurance scheme,'' he added.

7,BCC begins groundwork for polls,"bangalore: the state election commission has asked the bangalore city corporation (bcc) to gear up for the bcc elections due this year and begin all necessary preparations. the bcc, which is yet to receive an official communication from the government with regard to the polls, has started off by collecting the voter list, identifying polling booths, mustering and demustering centres and counting centres. according to bcc officials, the voter list which was prepared during the assembly elections would suffice for the civic polls. the assembly electoral roll was updated by the state election commission in january 2001, when it had commissioned a summary revision of electoral rolls. ``the state election commission has held discussions with the bcc and wants to review our preparedness to conduct the elections,'' the official informed. the bcc will appoint 28 returning officers (ro) in all the 28 ranges of the city. nearly two to three wards will come under the purview of one ro and the bcc has identified 3,144 polling booths covering all the 100 wards, with each ward comprising of at least 30 voting booths. nearly 12 centres have been listed out for mustering and demustering work, the places where the election material is dispatched and collected. the bcc has zeroed in on 15 buildings which will be the counting centres, the sources added. ``the voting centres that were identified during the previous bcc elections in 1996 holds good for the forthcoming elections also. we have made some additions and deletions to the list based on several factors,'' the sources said. even as the government contemplates delimitation of wards and including the seven city municipal corporations around the city into the bcc limits, so far there has been no move by the government on the issue.

8,"`India, Pakistan have moved an inch closer'","hubli: the reactions to the agra summit in the twin cities have been critical of little progress achieved and talks getting derailed. here is what some citizens had to say: lt.gen (retired) s.c. sardeshpande, dharwad: the summit ending inconclusively was on expected lines. as long as pakistan wants the kashmir dispute to be focal point and india insists that cross-border terrorism should take centrestage, nothing will come out of it. the hope that the talks will pave the way for peace in the valley has fallen flat. the military stand is that de-escalation of violence in the valley is ruled out. in fact, failure of talks will only spur on militant outfits in kashmir. prime minister vajpayee inviting president pervez musharraf for peace talks was not a blunder. unlike india, the military is the most powerful institution in pakistan. musharraf is the right man to hold talks, though the indians blame him for the kargil war. the agra summit though disappointing, both countries have moved an inch closer.'' shyam kulkarni, former air force personnel, dharwad: ``i appreciate pakistan president pervez musharraf's frankness in disagreeing with the indian point of view on kashmir. but musharraf is not a man from whom we can expect anything concrete. does he have the maturity to hold talks of such importance? it requires statesmanship, diplomacy and most importantly, the mandate of the people from the country he represents. after the 1971 war, pakistan is hellbent on taking revenge. that is the reason pakistan is encouraging violence in kashmir. india along with holding peace talks with pakistan, should crush militant organisations in the valley. if militant outfits are wiped out, the atmosphere for future talks will change in india's favour.''

9,Rs 68-cr Bellary project awaits govt nod,"bellary: deputy commissioner jawaid akhtar on tuesday said, a rs 68-crore proposal has been sent for the approval of the karnataka government. the proposal aims at launching projects to generate employment for agriculture labourers besides helping small and marginal farmers. various works have been envisaged under the ``shelf'' project to provide relief to the people affected by monsoon failure. he, however, hoped that rain, though belated, may bring relief to farmers that could engage them in cultivation activities. speaking to the times of india, the deputy commissioner said, only 14 per cent of the land had been cultivated till june-end; but the most worrying fact is a majority of the crops grown in the 14 acres of land are withering away due to lack of rain. ``rain in the last two weeks came to the rescue of the crops.'' speaking about the work envisaged under the ``shelf'' project, the deputy commissioner said the district administration was contemplating handing over the responsibility to the gram panchayat secretaries to ensure ""transparency"" in finding beneficiaries of the scheme. the revenue department had identified as many as 18 revenue hoblis spread across seven taluks as drought-affected. a meeting had been called on wednesday to explore ways and means to provide employment through the scheme, monitoring of works keeping in mind the agriculture labourers and helping small and marginal farmers. akhtar said, an action plan has been prepared which promises a minimum of 5,000 jobs in each of the affected taluks. ``for this, the administration will spend rs 27 crore a month in all the seven taluks.'' the continuity of the scheme will hinge on the rainfall in next two months. mini-water supply scheme, digging and rejuvenating borewells, supply of fodder to the cattle and conversion of farmers' short-term crop loans into mid-term ones have been included in the shelf project. some 403 villages have been identified as facing acute water scarcity and to tide over this situation it has been planned to dig 151 borewells, besides rejuvenating 260 borewells and flushing out 209 borewells. some 172 `shelf' groups of projects will be undertaken to tackle drought this year. besides, rs 51 lakh will be spent on urban water supply scheme, taking the total cost spent on drinking water works to rs 3.78 crore.

10,"Gang of thieves busted, three arrested","new delhi: with the arrest of three persons, the police in south delhi claimed to have busted a gang of thieves who used to target containers at the inland container depot, tughlaqabad, carrying goods for export. the three have been identified as vinod sharma (38), bhikhu prasad (32) and prem pal (38). the police also claimed to have recovered stolen goods worth rs 40 lakh from the accused. police officials said the trio would either lure truck drivers to assist them in the theft of goods from unattended trucks or they would take the vehicles to an isolated place, break open the central excise department's seal and pilfer some of the goods. the seal would then be replaced. because the crime was detected only after the container reached its overseas destination complaints were rarely lodged with the delhi police. a few weeks back the anti-auto theft squad of the south district learnt that vinod sharma, a notorious thief, had started stealing goods from the container depot. a special team was set up and investigations initiated. on july 10, the police were tipped-off that vinod and his accomplices were stealing articles from a container truck near apollo hospital. a raid was conducted and the trio allegedly caught red-handed while removing cartons from the truck. it was found that the goods belonged to alps industries in sahibabad and were being sent to new york. the accused had removed 35 cartons containing goods worth rs 40 lakh. police officials said that vinod is the gang leader and has at least six cases filed against him. during interrogation, vinod reportedly told the police that he was selling the stolen articles to two persons, kishan lal gupta and saluja. a case has been registered by the sarita vihar police and efforts are underway to identify and arrest other members of the gang and receivers of the stolen goods.
