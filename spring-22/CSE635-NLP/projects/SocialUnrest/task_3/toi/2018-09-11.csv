0,RJD ally BSP sore about government's functioning,"patna: even as the rjd chief laloo prasad yadav has to listen to the congress's 'unhappiness' over the slow implementation of the common minimum programme at delhi, the bahujan samaj party-another ally of the rashtriya janata dal (rjd) government in bihar has expressed its unhappiness over the functioning of the state government. the meeting of the state executive of the party has expressed its concern over the falling law and order situation in the state and carnages taking place in bihar. the bsp has also expressed its anger against inadequate arrangements of relief for the flood and drought victims and asked the government to take steps in order to minimise the effect of floods in bihar. the party also spoke of launching mass agitations over public issues for the formation of a viable alternative in bihar. the meeting while announcing the list of 20 district presidents resolved to strengthen the party in the state. meanwhile, the former chief minister of the state jagannath mishra in a fax message to prime minister atal bihari vajpayee has urged the centre to give rs 1,500 crore for undertaking flood protection measures. mishra pointed out that not a single paise has been spent on making or maintaining embankments during the past 11 years. mishra said that a population of about four million in 16 districts have been hit by current spate of floods. he said that property worth rs 150 crore had been damaged and according to a non-government figure, 150 persons have so far died in the floods. he said that the relief work undertaken by the state government was disappointing because the state has received only 30,000 tonne of foodgrains from the centre against the promise of 1 lakh tonne. he pointed out that while an all party delegation to the pm had demanded a sum of rs 967 crore for providing relief to the flood-hit, the centre was yet to take final decision in this regard. he also complained about the lack of medicine to prevent the spread of epidemic once the waters starts receding. in another development, the rjd has criticised union minister ram vilas paswan and dubbed him as anti-dalit. party leaders pitamber paswan and ram kripal yadav charged the union minister of indulging in cheap politics and said that misnistry's headed by him were on the verge of collapse. they charged the centre of trying to cover paswan's irregularity in the purchase of cranes when he headed the railway ministry.

1,Scholars clash over Sanskrit studies,"kolkata: dhyanesh narayan chakrabarti, emeritus fellow in culture with the government of india, attacked both communists and the congress on monday for neglecting sanskrit education in post independence india. speaking at a seminar on 'indian languages in the 21st century' arranged by the press information bureau, he said the centre and state governments have neglected the report of various commissions set up from time to time to decide the future education policy. chakrabarti said although such commissions had recommended the introduction of sanskrit as a compulsory language in schools and colleges, the recommendations were violated by the governments. he made special mention of the bhabatosh dutta commission whose recommendations on this issue was neglected by the west bengal government. he said the language had finally assumed importance under the present central government. he said it has become fashionable to ridicule and criticise anything which is related to indian culture. in this context, he made special mention of 'saffronisation' which has become a common phrase nowadays. shall we go for saffronisaation which is part of our culture or shall we infuse red idealism in our society which is alien to our culture? he said. chakrabarti said sanskrit was not neglected to this extent, even during the british rule. senior journalist geetesh sharma said that if sanskrit was in a sorry state, the so-called protectors of the language were to blame for this. lower castes and women were not allowed to read sanskrit. even today almost all indian languages like maithili and rajasthani, have a declining readership. hindi, he said, has somehow managed to survive due to various translations in the language. bengali is in a relatively better position because there is a large number of bengali readers in bangladesh. sharma said while the oxford english dictionary is updated every year, there is not a single updated hindi dictionary in the market. he said large sections of hindi speaking residents of kolkata prefer to read english newspapers.

6,ABVP students protest outside Thane College,"thane: the akhil bharatiya vidyarthi parishad (abvp) staged several demonstrations in front of the thane college on monday morning to protest against the reported demand made by muslim students to perform namaaz on college premises. ironically, the college authorities have categorically denied that such a demand was ever made by any of their students. according to the abvp activists, education institutions are not religious places where prayers can be offered but centres of knowledge where religion should be kept aside. however, college principal s. d. gokhale told this newspaper that he had never received any such request from muslim students. meanwhile, the nationalist youth congress (nyc) has alleged that the abvp itself is behind these rumours. ``the abvp is deliberately trying to sow seeds of communalism. no demand to offer namaaz on college premises was made by any of the 100-odd muslim students,'' said thane president of nyc, nazim mullah. later, mr mullah along with nyc president jitendra achad met thane police commissioner s. m. shangari and demanded that action be taken against those who are involved in spreading these rumours.

10,Amendment to exam rules gets good response,"bangalore: the bangalore university academic council meeting held last week decided to amend the existing examination rules. it said students should have passed in at least two subjects to enter the second year degree and all the subjects of the first year to enter the third year. the decision has received a positive response from all quarters. but what is beyond one's imagination is what made the university not have one such rule so far! no wonder students, on several instances, took years to complete their degree. they would just enrol for the degree course and forget all about completing it. the resolution which the academic council adopted was moved by a person with a non-academic background. he said: ``if the changes are not effected, the quality of degree education cannot be improved. the changes are very much needed due to fall in demand for general degree education.'' that the decision was taken in the last of the academic council meetings before the academic body is wound up following the new universities bill, is a reflection on the academic affairs of the university.

11,Dharwad SOS to govt for funds,"dharwad: * fourteen farmers committed suicide in dharwad district in the last seven months unable to repay loan. the farmers suffered the twin blows of monsoon failure and crash in prices of agricultural produce. recently, 24-year-old bharamappa kotrappa ended his life by consuming pesticide in halligeri of navalgund taluk. * large-scale migration of labour to urban areas in search of jobs every day. most of them, including women, come to hubli-dharwad and get employed in construction work. some have already left their villages to the neighbouring state of goa. * shortage of drinking water and fodder has forced the farmers to sell their cattle to slaughterhouses at throwaway prices. a healthy cow, which would have fetched not less than rs 4,000, was being sold for rs 600 at the apmc cattle fair on saturday in amargol of hubli. these grim facts demonstrate how severe the drought is in the district. but the government has released only rs 2.48 crore towards drought relief works though the district administration had sought rs 11 crore. fearing the worst situation in the coming days, if rabi also fails, the district administration has sent a contingency plan to the government. the advance action plan with revised proposals would focus on providing drinking water during october and november. amid criticism that the relief measures are not reaching the affected areas, deputy commissioner kapil mohan asserted that works were being taken up on a ``war footing''. he said, ``of the five taluks of the district, the worst hit are kundgol and navalgund. we have found good response to the food-for-work scheme in these taluks compared with other regions. each labourer is paid a daily wage of rs 46.'' mohan said food grains worth rs 1.3 crore had been released for this project. ``in yereboodhihal village alone, 800 persons are provided employment every day.'' however, opposition parties as also farmers allege that the scheme is there only on paper. mohan countered: ``the work starts early in the morning and ends around noon. those who visit the workspot for inspection should come in the morning to known the truth.'' according to him, fodder and drinking water shortage will be severely felt if the rain further fails. mohan opines that not only the rural areas, but also hubli-dharwad would be facing a serious situation. hdmc officials confirm that with the existing water at neersagar and malaprabha, the drinking water supply to the twin cities can be maintained only for a month. denying the allegation that distress sale of cattle was going unchecked, mohan said there was not even 2 per cent increase in the sale of cattle meat from slaughterhouses in hubli. perhaps, cattle are better off in this district. farmers' suicide cases seem to have no impact on the government. when the first two cases of suicide were reported from navalur and gamanagatti villages, the state government compensated the bereaved families with rs 1 lakh. after that, the government took a stand that compensation will be provided only after a magisterial enquiry.

12,Oppn slams govt on drought relief,"bangalore: opposition leader in the legislative council k h srinivas on monday urged the state government to prioritise its expenditure and release more funds for the drought-affected districts. ``it is not right to blame the centre for not releasing funds to karnataka when the state itself hasn't released adequate amount. seeking an aid of rs 908 crore from the centre and releasing rs 15 crore from the state exchequer questions our credibility. the government is yet to understand the gravity of the situation,'' srinivas, who toured the drought-affected districts, told reporters here. in a letter to chief minister krishna, he urged the government to immediately release rs 1 crore for each taluk and postpone the recovery of farmers' cooperative loans and waiving of interest. refuting revenue minister h.c. srikantaiah's claim that the fodder stock is adequate, srinivas said all districts reeling under drought do not even have a blade of grass. ``it is time the government buys fodder from other states to tide over the crisis,'' he added. he urged the government to convene an all-party meeting to review the situation. ``we are prepared to support the government if there is commitment on their part,'' he asserted.

22,ABVP students protest outside Thane College,"thane: the akhil bharatiya vidyarthi parishad (abvp) staged several demonstrations in front of the thane college on monday morning to protest against the reported demand made by muslim students to perform namaaz on college premises. ironically, the college authorities have categorically denied that such a demand was ever made by any of their students. according to the abvp activists, education institutions are not religious places where prayers can be offered but centres of knowledge where religion should be kept aside. however, college principal s d gokhale told this newspaper that he had never received any such request from muslim students. meanwhile, the nationalist youth congress (nyc) has alleged that the abvp itself is behind these rumours. ""the abvp is deliberately trying to sow seeds of communalism. no demand to offer namaaz on college premises was made by any of the 100-odd muslim students,"" said thane president of nyc, nazim mullah. later, mr mullah along with nyc president jitendra achad met thane police commissioner s. m. shangari and demanded that action be taken against those who are involved in spreading these rumours.

27,New health policy will widen inequities,"new delhi: the new health policy, revised after a long gap of almost two decades, will only increase the inequities in provision of health care. the policy not only suggests user charges at the district-level hospitals but also a system of licentiate medical practitioners to meet the needs of primary health centres. undoubtedly, the policy voices the right concerns on patents, medical research and education, communicable diseases, ethics and women's health. it also seems to be interested in reviving the weakest health care link ^ the phcs, with its suggestion of additional 55 per cent of the current outlay for them. the secondary and tertiary sectors get only 35 per cent and 10 per cent respectively. but even as it suggests to revive these sectors, the government does express its inability to get medical doctors to work there. therefore, it suggests encouraging the practice of licentiate medical practitioners and training of paramedical personnel to provide health care in difficult areas. clearly, the government has different standards of care for the rich and the poor. moreover, it wants to open more centres, which will require additional staff as well. as it is, a large part of government money goes into salaries. the issue then is how far the additional allocation will be useful for reviving phcs. it would be worth pointing out that for the 23,000 phcs supposed to be functioning across the country, there is already a sanctioned strength of 25,000 doctors. the phcs are expected to take the major disease load while also working at their prevention. but with the current functioning, the burden spills over to specialised and super-speciality centres. it is at this level that the government proposes a user fee, a suggestion which most likely will push more into the hands of the private sector. public health specialist, dr d banerji, says the concept of user charges is impractical. ``we are talking about health care for poor people. studies have already shown that healthcare expenditure is the second largest cause of rurual indebtedness.'' dr imraana qadir, another public health specialist at the jawahar lal nehru university agrees: ``user charges hit the very poor. we don't invest in hospitals to improve their condition, but talk about cutting subsidies which may make health care inaccessible to the poor.'' and in the present conditions, if people are asked to pay at government hospitals, then it will only push them to the private sector, where there is little control on quality of care. of course, the government does talk about controlling the private sector. the health policy, quite ambitiously, has set a target of two years of bringing into force the necessary legislations on infrastructure and quality control for the private sector. ``they just talk, they don't know how to implement. first, implementation is difficult as health is a state subjecy. and second, the centre has been unbale to improve the administrative machinery of its own institutions, based right here in delhi, banerji adds.

28,Surprised Congress now seeks October polls,"new delhi: the congress was literally caught napping by the samajwadi party, whose legislators in uttar pradesh resigned en masse from the state assembly on tuesday. the congress was particularly cut up as its state unit had planned a similar move and had also made several public pronouncements about this in the past few months. but the samajwadi party has clearly seized the political initiative with an eye on the upcoming assembly elections. the samajwadi party's timing is also significant, since the congress had planned to launch a massive election campaign through the state later this month. while the political drama was unfolding in lucknow, congress president sonia gandhi called an informal meeting of the congress working committee (cwc) in delhi to discuss the fallout of the samajwadi party's decision. acknowledging that its political rivals has stolen a march over it, the congress made a vain bid to salvage the situation by projecting itself to be ``different"" from its rivals. not wanting to give the impression that it is blindly following the samajwadi party's agenda, the congress announced that though it is vehemently opposed to the rajnath singh government, it would not disturb the status quo till october 17, the date when five years will be over since the last assembly polls. ``we would not like to continue as mlas after the term ends. after that, we will agitate,"" said ghulam nabi azad, aicc general secretary in charge of up affairs. according to him, the cwc reiterated the state unit's position which, it believes, is the ``right stand."" azad failed to respond to the samajwadi party's decision, stating that ``their decision was theirs...we are only concerned with ourselves."" azad said in the congress view the up assembly completes its five-year term on october 17, since mlas started drawing their salaries from that date and even participated in the legislative council and rajya sabha elections in november. ``we believe the assembly polls should be held in october and we will press for it,"" he said. s p jaiswal, president of the up congress, declared that the party will launch a massive agitation and resort to a gherao of the assembly to highlight its demand. while the congress made a desperate attempt to distance itself from the sp's decision officially, its leaders were clearly upset that its state unit had failed to read the writing on the wall and respond swiftly to the situation. ``it is clear we had no proper strategy in up. although we had announced that our mlas would resign, it appears we were not serious about this move,"" said a senior congress leader. the congress, they said, is a marginalised force in up, it has no social base and no effective leadership. ``if we had taken the initiative, we could have created some kind of impact in our poll campaign,"" said another up leader, adding it would have been a good talking point in their public meetings.

29,Govt apathy leave farmers in a daze,"koppal: ""today it's our cattle, tomorrow our old parents and the day after tomorrow it'll be our children and finally, we'll follow them."" this is how hiremukrthihal villagers in kushtagi taluk of koppal district react. the statement exposes how grave the drought situation is in koppal district and how dejected are these people about the government which has failed to come to their aid in this hour of crisis. the sudden death of eight cattle last thursday due to starvation has had these hapless people in a funk. it has not only worried the people about the well-being of their livestock but also about their own survival if there is no rainfall within a few days. this tale of woes is not restricted only to hiremukrthihal village. the news of cattle deaths due to starvation has been trickling in from many other villages in kushtagi taluk. livestock is hard hit in siddapur, mannapur and tavargere villages and this does not mean domestic animals elsewhere are safe. according to official sources, drought has affected cattle population severely in almost all 160 villages of kushtagi taluk. ""animals are starving in more than 400 villages of kushtagi, koppal, yelaburga and gangavathi taluks,"" pointed a koppal zilla panchayat officer. the worst part of this sordid episode of cattle deaths is the district administration's decision to close down two cattle camps which were opened in the taluk in august last. the camps were shut down following officials' failure to ensure fodder. the burdened villagers are critical of government's relief works. they lamented this is the first time their animals were dying due to starvation. ""we can't bear the loss and see the cattle dying before our eyes. we are unable to either feed them or drive them out,"" said yamunappa, a farmer in siddapur village, who said the situation would be worse if there were no rains in a couple of days. on the other hand, the veterinary doctors in the district appeared to be fighting a losing battle to save the livestock. ""how could we save them when there is no fodder,"" asks radhakrishna reddy, assistant director of veterinary department, who has been touring the drought-affected villages to treat the animals. confirming the cattle deaths in various villages of kushtagi taluk, dr reddy said: ""though we may not say the deaths were due to starvation, we can say that diarrhoea and dysentery due to malnourishment have caused the deaths."" despite the grim situation, the district administration has failed to draw up any contingency plan for drought relief to save both animals and human beings.
