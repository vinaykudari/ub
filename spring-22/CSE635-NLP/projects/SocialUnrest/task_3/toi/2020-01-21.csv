0,State Congress move to resurrect the party,"LUCKNOW: The UP Congress Committee has stepped up efforts to get feedbacks about the impact of party president Sonia Gandhiâ€™s direct interaction programme with the people in the state. In a directive from the UPCC headquarters, the divisional heads have been asked to furnish a detailed report of Soniaâ€™s interaction programme with the party workers, its impact and reaction in the party.

Itâ€™s part of the partyâ€™s strategy to feel the peopleâ€™s pulse. The divisional heads have also been asked to assess how do the masses rate Mayawati government or what do they think of SPâ€™s chances of staging a comeback?

The circular issued to all vice-presidents, general secretaries, secretaries and district heads, contains an eight-point questionnaire seeking detailed information on their activities, impact and the assessment of their rivals. The information bank compiled thus, says party sources, will finally be sent to 10 Janpath where serious attempts at resurrecting the UP units are currently underway.

The deadline for handing over the report cards is January 29 and 30, the days of their formal meeting with UPCC president Arun Kumar Singh Munna who has been categorically asked to strengthen the party network in anticipation of a snap poll in the state, according to UPCC sources on Monday.

Among other things, the district presidents have been asked to â€œassess the votersâ€™ pulse on the BJP-BSP coalition and also the status of other political parties.

Moreover, the emphasis on cleansing the party is also evident as the district heads have been asked to record the criminal antecedents, if any, of their co-workers along with details on assets and liabilities of their respective units.

â€œDoes your unit have a proper office? If not, where do you run your activities from? What arrangements/ procedures do you follow for redressing public grievances?â€� are some other posers the questionnaire contains. And, most importantly, each unit has been asked to mention glaring problems of their area which has the potential of being converted into major electoral issues for the party.

This time tall claims on papers will not do, according to a UPCC source. The district heads have been ordered to bring along with them the detailed records of their activities and press clippings.

2,Mobile-to-mobile incoming calls to become free,"NEW DELHI: Within a day of calling truce with basic telecom players, the cellular operators on Tuesday decided to make incoming calls from cell phones to cell phones free across various networks.

This is part of their commitment to make weekly announcements, which was derailed for some time due to dispute between cellular operators and basic telecom players over the issue of interconnection.

Two state-owned PSUs -- MTNL and BSNL-- are yet to give their consent to this move. As of now, all other cellular operators have decided to make incoming calls free across their networks, private cellular operators said in a joint statement.

The benefits of free incoming calls would be available through a package to all categories of subscribers-- prepaid and post paid, the statement said.

The free incoming calls would be implemented with effect from now but in certain service areas the network needs to be upgraded and therefore the process could take a week in some circles.

""Consequently, it was agreed that the subscribers would transition from the current regime to the mobile to mobile incoming calls free between now and February, 2003,"" the release said, adding that the date of launch in different markets would be communicated individually by respective operators.

In Delhi the decision is likely to be implemented by the weekend, Bharti officiaL said.

The joint statement issued by private cellular operators including Bharti, Hutchison, BPL Mobile, Escotel, Idea, Oasis and RPG cellular said that they announced free incoming on mobile-to-mobile after they got assurance from the government to come out with a non-discriminatory and cost based interconnection.

Reliance, the cellular operator in Kolkata and northeast, said that they were contacted by the cellular operators only at 1620 hours and were asked for their consent within 30 minutes.

Reliance officials said the time was ""inadequate"" to respond.

MTNL officials said that they would need telecom regulator TRAI''s approval before giving their consent.
