0,Is govt move hindering truth?,"BANGALORE: Karnataka Lok Ayukta Justice N. Venkatachala has said the state governmentâ€™s decision to revoke suspension of three officials of the Drugs Control Department will be of no assistance in carrying out a detailed investigation into the Rs 300 crore drug scam as the disciplinary action against them has been kept pending.

â€œThe government has only revoked the suspension of the officials. It is not sufficient. If truth has to be revealed, the government has to withdraw disciplinary action against them and only then can I conduct the investigation,â€™â€™ Venkatachala told The Times of India. He said the officials might be under pressure not to divulge the truth. â€œIf the government holds back disciplinary action, these officials might never reveal the truth fearing punishment,â€™â€™ he said and added that a decision on resuming investigation would be taken only after conducting another hearing on Tuesday.

The three officers â€” M.N. Ramamurthy, D. Kanti Kumar Bhaskar (both deputy drug controllers) and H. Srinivas (assistant drug controller) have been instructed to appear before the Lok Ayukta on Tuesday.

The same day, Health Secretary S.L. Gangadharappa, would present himself before the Lok Ayukta with regard to the contempt notice on suspending the three officers. Venkatachala said such interference was bound to affect investigations. â€œAfter I took exception to the suspension of the officers, it was revoked. Now that we have sought withdrawal of disciplinary action against them, I will hear the government reaction tomorrow,â€™â€™ he said. Based on a complaint that action was not being taken to prevent sale of spurious drugs, the Lok Ayukta had conducted a raid on drug controllerâ€™s office on March 27. The three officials had come forward to assist the Lok Ayukta in investigating the case by providing further evidence. However, the government had placed them under suspension, which was revoked later.

1,Salary grind for govt teachers,"MOHALI: Itâ€™s noon and there is a large crowd outside the State Bank of Patiala, Phase VII branch. Comprising mostly women and a handful of men, the crowd is busy counting money and signing registers, wiping sweat from foreheads. When asked what was going on, pat came the reply from one of them, â€˜â€˜We are government school teachers and have come here to collect our salaries.â€™â€™

What about the school and the students? â€˜â€˜Well, since we have to collect our salaries, we closed down the school at noon,â€™â€™ said a teacher. But why didnâ€™t they get their salaries in schools? One teacher said that this practice had been going on for quite some time now and had come to be accepted as normal.

But not all teachers were happy with this arrangement. Many of them had come from villages in the sub-division and were unhappy that they had to sit in the open to get their pay. â€˜â€˜There are no fans and water and we just have to wait in the sun or look for some shady spot to stand till we get our money,â€™â€™ said a primary school teacher.

Though none liked this practice of coming to the bank to collect their salary, they were not willing to come on record. One elderly teacher even told others in a stern voice, â€˜â€˜Are you not happy that at least you are getting paid?â€™â€™ A senior male teacher was more accommodating as he told that the move had been initiated for security reasons. Explaining the procedure, he said that the Block Education Officer gets the cheques and passes them on to the respective centre in charge, who handles 9 to 10 schools each. They withdraw the money and distribute it among the teachers.

One of the women distributing the money lamented that they did not even have proper sitting facilities. â€˜â€˜We used to sit inside the bank branch but the management told us to move out as it affected their business with more than a hundred people standing inside. So we have to carry on the business outside. We do feel insecure handling this much money sitting in a corridor but what else can we do,â€™â€™ she added.

â€˜â€˜We are aware that students suffer but we cannot do anything about it. We have to collect our salaries. This practice is applicable to all the schools. On Monday only the middle and primary school teachers had come. There would be days when high school and senior secondary school teachers will also come to get their pay and again students will have to suffer on this account.â€™â€™

2,Need to identify distortions in agricultural policy: Ahluwalia,"LUDHIANA: Leader of World Bank expert group on agriculture Dr Deepak Ahluwalia on Monday strongly advocated doing away with policy distortions in the legal and regulatory framework of Punjab agriculture if it has to become competitive in the post-liberalised scenario of the Indian economy.

Dr Ahluwalia was on visit to Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) along with the group members as part of interaction with the government, agro-processing industry and farmers. The purpose of the visit is to bring out a status paper on the stateâ€™s agricultural policy.

In a discussion with the PAU experts, the World Bank team repeatedly stressed on the PAU efforts on policy analysis for identifying distortions that stand in the way of further growth of Punjab agriculture. Dr Ahluwalia pointed out that though the Indian edible oil seeds were highly competitive by international standards but the quality of edible oil lacked in this respect. Citing reasons, he singled out poor and obsolete technologies used by domestic industry.

Restrictive regulations, he observed, did not permit improvements in the processing industry. Deregulation was therefore essential for strengthening domestic industry, he added. He, however, clarified that it would not be in place to look towards the government for financial support in view of high fiscal deficit situation.

The private sector would step in to provide required logistics if the regulatory environment was made more flexible in this respect, he suggested adding that his team would want PAU to go in for lobbying with the government with a view to bring about policy change in this regard.

The issues of pricing, conservation of natural resources, demand of cereals, subsidies, power tariff and its impact on agricultural development were also discussed. PAU VC Dr KS Aulakh, while concurring with the observations of the World Bank team, remarked that various university recommendations like early sowing of cotton, processing of dairy products could fructify only if a conducive environment was created.

3,PSEB engineers protest against Electricity Bill,"PATIALA: As directed by All India Power Engineers Federation and National Co-Ordination Committee, the PSEB Engineers observed â€œProtest Dayâ€� on Monday by wearing black badges and holding protest meetings and rallies throughout the state, against the re-introduction of â€œElectricity Bill 2001â€� in the Parliament.

The Electricity Bill is a legislation to replace all existing statutes like the Electricity Act, 1910, the Electricity Supply Act, 1948 and Electricity Regulatory Commission Act, 1998. This legislation will convert the remaining state electricity boards (SEBs) of the country into companies and provide an enabling legislative framework for unbundling and privatisation of SEBs in the country, a PSEB Engineers Association spokesman said here on Monday. In the previous cases of unbundling of SEBs, each State had to first enact a Bill in the state legislature and then proceed with corporatisation and privatisation of power sector, he added.

However, with the passing of the Bill there will be no necessity for the remaining states including Punjab to enact any Bill in the state legislature. The concerned State would then only have to issue necessary notification and transfer scheme to corporatise and privatise the power sector, the spokesman said.

PSEB Engineers Association had strongly represented to the central government that imposing structural changes on the countryâ€™s power sector was an infringement of state autonomy. The Bill amounts to an abdication by the government of its duty to supply power to poor section of the consumers such as agricultural and rural areas, the association said.

4,Notice issued to Punjab minister,"CHANDIGARH: The Punjab government decision to remove six elected directors of the Amritsar Central Co-operative Bank had its echo in the Punjab and Haryana High Court when a writ petition challenging the same was taken up for consideration.

Petitioners Gopal Singh Jania, a resident of Jania village, Jandiala Guru tehsil, Amritsar, and five other directors of the respondent bank have sought the quashing of the orders of March 21, 2003, passed by the Joint Registrar, Co-operative Societies, Jalandhar, by which the petitioners were removed.

They alleged the order was nothing but political vendetta unleashed by the present Congress regime against its political opponents at the behest of excise and taxation minister Sardool Singh who has been cited as one of the respondents.

Terming the order as illegal, arbitrary and against natural justice, the petitioners submitted that they had been elected on May 8, 2000, and their term was to continue till May, 2005. They also prayed for quashing of the notice of June 28, 2002, vide which they had been asked to show cause as to why their membership should not cease.

After hearing preliminary arguments, a division bench of Justices NK Sodhi and Adarsh Kumar Goel on Monday issued notices to Sardool Singh, Punjab co-operation secretary, registrar of co-operative societies among others.

Bail confirmed

Justice KC Gupta on Monday confirmed the interim bail already granted to former Haryana minister Brij Mohan Singla in a case registered under Section 406, 420, 201-B of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and under Section 13(1)(d) of the Prevention of Corruption Act.

It was contended by Singlaâ€™s counsel that the case was politically motivated to harass his client as the complaint about the property had been filed in 1997 by one SK Gupta who was not at all connected with the property.

It was also pointed out that during the investigation it had been found that SK Gupta was a habitual complainant and the police had registered a case against him under Section 182, IPC, as it was found he filed false complaints time and again.

It was further submitted that the allegation mentioned in the complaint was the subject matter of an earlier complaint also in which the petitioner had been exonerated.

Notice to GoI

Justice Jasbir Singh on Monday issued notice to the Government of India for July 23 to apprise the court about the action, if any, was proposed to be taken against Anil Kumar, former deputy commissioner, Rohtak, in the context of the inquiry by the vigilance authorities about alleged irregularities in the funds spent in flood-affected areas during his tenure.

The allegation was that he had spent funds for floods in another area at the behest of former Haryana minister Sri Kishan Dass. The permission for the registration of the case under the Prevention of Corruption Act was also awaited.

5,One lakh to court arrest in Delhi: Bhajan,"CHANDIGARH: Voicing concern over the Centreâ€™s failure to get the Satluj-Yamuna Link Canal (SYL) completed as per the ruling of the Supreme Court, Haryana Congress president Bhajan Lal on Monday announced that nearly one lakh people from the state would court arrest in Delhi on May 15 if the Centre failed to start work on the Punjab portion of canal by that date.

Bhajan Lal, who was speaking at a press conference after presiding over a meeting of partyâ€™s executive convened here to chalk out the future course of action over SYL issue, also explained that the â€˜â€˜jail bharoâ€� agitation was to start earlier from April 13, but it had been deferred due to the fact that the farmers had been busy harvesting wheat this month.

Asked as to why Delhi had been selected for the purpose and not Chandigarh, Lal said that once the Punjab government had failed to abide by the January 15, 2002 ruling of the Supreme Court, now it was the responsibility of the Centre to get the canal completed through its agencies. As such, now the fight was against the Central government, said Lal adding that the people of Haryana were ready to make any sacrifice to get the Punjab portion of the canal completed at the earliest.

The apex court in its January 15, 2002 ruling had directed Punjab to complete its portion of the canal within one year and also stated that in the event of Punjab failing to do so, it would be the responsibility of the Central government to get the canal completed through its agencies. The court, however, did not set any deadline for the Centre to accomplish the task.

Sources reveal that a section of leadership, including Congress Legislature Party leader Bhupinder Singh Hooda, at the meeting was in favour of sticking to the original plan of starting the â€˜â€˜jail bharoâ€™ agitation from April 13.

They expressed the opinion that instead of courting arrests in Delhi, it would be more appropriate if the same was done at district headquarters within the state.

Asked if there was any development regarding former finance minister Mange Ram Guptaâ€™s suggestion that all Haryana MLAs and MPs should resign over the SYL issue, Lal said the ruling party should take the initiative and the Congress would definitely follow the suit.

6,Shinde hints at snap polls,"MUMBAI: Chief minister Sushilkumar Shinde urged MLAs of his ruling Democratic Front to keep in constant touch with their constituents because state elections could be round the corner.

He told Democratic Front members at a meeting in Vidhan Bhavan that though the assembly elections were scheduled for the second half of 2004, they could be rescheduled.

He did not say anything categorical on the schedule of these elections or mention any proposal to reschedule them, but asked the legislators to remain prepared.

Mr Shindeâ€™s hint that the government may go in for a snap poll has sent shock waves among the ruling party MLAs. The CM also criticised legislators who kept putting pressure on ministers and the administration to transfer government officers, especially police officers and engineers of departments that implement development projects.

â€œI can understand if you ask for the transfer of an officer from your constituency or seek transfer of an officer to your constituency,â€™â€™ he said. â€œHowever, the general demand for transferring officers in unhealthy and creates a lot of problems for the officers.â€™â€™

7,Illegal structure in Khar demolished after protests,"MUMBAI: The hammer of the civic demolition squad came down on an illegal three-storey building at Khar on Monday even as it was being painted.

Although construction work on the building on plot no 67, Ambedkar Road, Chuim Village, Khar (W), had begun three weeks ago, local residents were too scared to complain about it. Finally, some of them approached civic crusader Edwin Britto last week.

Mr Britto dashed off letters to the local ward officer Anil Khoje, the local Senior Police Inspector Pundalik Bodke and the local corporator Ashish Shelar of the BJP.

The matter was also taken up by architect Madhav Deshpande of the Forum for Justice, who met municipal commissioner K.C. Srivastava along with Mr Britto to complain about the way the H- West ward office was dragging its feet on the issue.

According to Mr Britto, the structure is unstable because it hardly has any foundation and is being put up on a framework of iron girders.

The forum says the builder has put up a brand new three-storey structure in the guise of repairing a ground-floor structure in the â€˜gaothanâ€™ area. A â€˜gaothanâ€™ is a cluster of cottages which housed the original settlers in the area.

Senior Inspector Bodke stopped the construction work on Saturday immediately after getting Mr Brittoâ€™s letter.

Mr Khoje told TNN on Monday that the demolition would continue on Tuesday. â€œWe will reduce the structure to its original size,â€™â€™ he said.

However, Mr Britto fears that the demolition might be an eyewash.He has seen several such demolitions where the civic squad retreats after knocking down a few walls and gives the builder time to get a stay order from the court.

â€œThe stay order is rarely challenged and the builder manages to complete the construction and sell off the flats to buyers,â€™â€™ he alleged.

8,Wildlife: Good news or flawed vision?,"NEW DELHI: The Union environment ministry says tiger and elephant numbers countrywide seem stable and numbers of leopards, lions and rhinos are actually going up. Conservationists question the methodology.

According to census figures released by the ministry, tiger numbers are down from about 3,800 in 1997 to 3,642 in 2001-02. Elephant numbers were put at over 28,000 in 2001, down from 29,000 in 1997 but up from the 1993 figure of 25,541.

Rhinos increased in numbers from under 1,500 in 1993 to 1,817 in 1999. Lions, their range limited to the Gir sanctuary, increased in numbers from 304 in 1995 to over 320 in 2001. UP has the dubious distinction of topping the list in leopard and tiger poaching.""At best, the numbers are stable,"" says recently retired additional director-general (wildlife) S C Sharma. ""Growth has not been possible."" Conservationist Ashok Kumar says numbers tend to be inflated, with the analysis less than believable.

Six-year-old leopard numbers are the most controversial. The ministry says the numbers of this animal rose from 6,828 in 1993 to 7,273 in 1997. The past six years have seen such poaching pressure on the leopard that Kumar doubts very much that numbers could have gone up. This resilient animal, he says, is ""exceedingly difficult to estimate"", the methodology being shaky.

Sharma tends to agree, saying at least a thousand animals must have been killed, even on a rough estimation, since the last census. The ministry says 404 leopard poaching cases were reported between 1999 and 2002.

Kumar''s hypothesis is that the past few years have witnessed a greater demand for leopard skins in the Western fashion industry and poached skins may be mixing with legal skins from Africa.

Tigers are less controversial. The numbers, says Kumar, peaked in 1992, with over 4,000 reported. Since then, poaching, habitat loss and a ""significant"" decline in prey base have seen numbers dip outside tiger reserves. In fact, adds Kumar, tigers are seen in greater numbers in tourist areas even within national parks, possibly because the prey base there is better protected.

The official view is that numbers are stable, the spinoffs seen in the overall environment since the tiger is considered a flagship indicator and its reserves are home to about 300 rivers. The ministry is, nevertheless, planning a study to assess ideal numbers, given the loss of habitat and prey base.

Elephant numbers do not show a perceptible decline. But these are long-living, slow-breeding animals, says Kumar -- and declining numbers will take time to register. Ominous signs are visible in the increasing incidents of conflict with people as these lumbering animals with huge appetites search for new homes.

9,PU principals to get less pay than teachers,"PATNA: Patna University (PU) is likely to face a serious constitutional crisis soon following the implementation of the revised UGC scales of pay.

The university has already notified pay fixation of about 200 lecturers and teachers, promoted as readers and professors under the provision of Merit Promotion Scheme (MPS), in the revised scales. As expected, payment of salaries in the revised scales would start as soon as the funds for the purpose are received from the state government. The government has already sanctioned a sum of Rs 43 crore for the payment of arrears in the revised scales to the university teachers and is awaiting details of funds requirement from the university.

Out of 450 teachers serving the university, at present only 200 will be eligible to get their salaries in the revised scales as per the university notification. The remaining 250 teachers, who have been promoted as readers and professors under the provisions of the Time-bound Promotion Scheme (TBPS), are likely to get lecturerâ€™s scale as per the government notification.

Surprisingly enough, almost all the principals of colleges and the heads of the post-graduate departments in PU belong to the TBPS category. It is going to be a never-before situation when the principal of a college would get the salary of a lecturer and teachers working under him would draw higher salaries of readers and professors. Under the existing system, the head of an institution getting less salary would have to forward the salary bills of his junior subordinate staff getting higher salaries. This would not only sound unethical but illegal, too. Ultimately, the university will have to replace all the principals and heads of the post-graduate departments to avoid legal hurdles, feel the legal experts.

The joint action committee of Futab and Fustab has written letters to the vice-chancellors of all the universities in the state to fix the salaries of all teachers promoted under TBPS in the revised scales in the light of the judgment of the Patna High Court with a view to maintaining academic peace in the colleges and universities. The universities are bound to do so until some stay is granted by the court or the previous judgment is reversed by it. The court is yet to decide the letters patent appeal (LPA) filed by the state government against the high court judgment, says Fustab secretary A K P Yadav.

10,Khatals in govt houses irk HC,"PATNA: The Patna High Court on Monday directed the stateâ€™s chief secretary, S N Biswas, present in the court to hold a meeting of the government officials concerned on illegal and unauthorised constructions on the premises of government quarters and submit a report in this connection in the court within two weeks.

Hearing on a PIL filed by advocate Arun Kumar Mukherjee, a division bench comprising Justice Nagendra Rai and Justice R S Garg sought reports on a number of such constructions at government costs without clearance of the maps of proposed buildings by the Patna Regional Development Authority (PRDA). The chief secretary, S N Biswas, was also directed to see how many unauthorised ''khatals'' have been constructed on the premises of government quarters.

It observed that nobody is above the rule of law. In another public interest litigation (PIL) filed by social activist Ajay Bhattacharya on the conditions of Bihar jails, the same division bench of Justice Rai and Justice Garg sought a detailed report by Wednesday from the state government on the Central grants to be spent in different jails under different heads for the improvement of prevailing condition. In the affidavit filed on Monday by the state government before the bench, it was stated that Rs 35 crore has been sanctioned for improvement in the jail conditions, 75 per cent of Rs 26 crore have been received from the Centre, while 25 per cent (about Rs 8 crore) are to be borne by the state government.

The hearing on the bail matter of Rajesh Ranjan alias Pappu Yadav, an accused in the CPM MLA Ajit Sarkar murder case and the president of the Indian Federal Democratic Party (IFDP), was adjourned on Monday by Justice S N Jha for April 25, as examinations of all the three prosecution witnesses in the trial court could not be completed. Of the three accused persons, Anil Yadav, could not be produced in the trial court on Monday, for which Beur jail superintendent B M Naik was asked to give an explanation.

11,J&K govt to review return plan for Pandits,"JAMMU: Notwithstanding the Nadimarg massacre of 24 Hindus three weeks ago, Jammu and Kashmr government has decided to have a fresh look at the action plan for the return of Kashmiri Pandits forced out of the valley by militancy.

Revenue and Rehabilitation Minister Hakim Mohammad Yasin said: ""We would review the action plan of Kashmiri Pandits'' return to the valley afresh after temporary setback to government''s initiative caused by the Nadimarg carnage in which 24 Pandits were killed on March 22.""

Yasin, who supervised the action plan of return of Pandits to the valley, said: ""The process of return plan has been halted for sometime in view of terror create due to the Nadimarg carnage.""

The government will first re-build the confidence among the Pandit community which has been shattered due to the brutal act, he said.

""We have visited Pandit families in Anantnag and Budgam asked the district authorities to take confidence-building measures,"" Yasin added.

He said 32 families, who have migrated after Nadimarg carnage and are putting up here, would be motivated for return to native places in the valley.

""If they do not return, then those Pandits would be registered and relief given to them,"" the Minister said.

Yasin said some vested interests, which are against the return of peace to Kashmir, were engineering such terror acts with sole aim of scuttling the plans for return of Pandits.

12,RS passes bill changing voting rules,"NEW DELHI: The Rajya Sabha overwhelmingly passed on Tuesday the official Bill making two major changes in elections to this House removing the requirements of secret balloting and state residency. The Bill now goes to the Lok Sabha. The Left parties were opposed; they were eloquently joined by eminent jurist Fali Nariman and another independent member, ex-army chief Shankar Roy Chowdhury (the latter opposed one of the two changes and Nariman, both). However, everyone else was for; the all-party standing committee of both Houses had, thus, cleared it for passage.

Once the Bill passes the Lok Sabha, too, one may contest an election to the Rajya Sabha from anywhere in India instead of formally testifying to residency in the state concerned. And the ballot will not be secret. The details of how this will be done will then be specified in the rules the government will make to enforce it and law minister Arun Jaitley says they welcome suggestions in this regard. The Bill is aimed at ending the new problem parties say they''re facing, of MLAs voting against the official candidate, allegedly in return for bribes. And of having someone who wishes to get elected from a state to get an official address, showing residency, in that state.

Fali Nariman denounced both changes as a fraud on Constitutional values and seeking to change something fundamental in the basic law through ordinary legislation. It was, he said, like seeking to abolish the law against murder because it wasn''t possible to end the crime. Jaitley, in a detailed reply, rejected all of Nariman''s arguments. Parliament had enacted the original rules and was, in the light of experience, reflecting a mass sentiment on changing these, to deal with emerging problems, he said.

The MLAs of each state will continue to elect who is to represent them in Delhi; what are being addressed are practical problems. Earlier, the House passed without dissent some amendments to the Essential Commodities Act to give it stiffer powers to regulate the issue of sugar for sale from factories. The change was necessitated by legal challenges to existing regulations in this regard.

13,"India, Singapore to increase economic ties","NEW DELHI: India and Singapore have signed a declaration of intent, agreeing to open negotiations on an agreement for economic cooperation on the occasion of the visit of Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong.

The agreement which is proposed to be concluded in 12-18 months and is called the Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) will include a free trade agreement, an agreement on investment promotion, protection and cooperation, a revised avoidance of double taxation agreement, a more liberal air services agreement and an open skies agreement for charter flight. The agreement will also facilitate setting up of an India-Singapore fund with a target of $1 billion to address investment opportunities in India and a second India Centre in Singapore and Tourism Cooperation.

The two countries also signed am MoU for collaboration in extending technical assistance to Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam as part of the support to Asean''s new members. Addressing a joibt CII-FICCI luncheon the Prime Minister Goh expressed hope that CECA would be completed early. On the issue of India''s role as a IT superpower Goh said Singapore''s open and accommodating policies had facilitated Indian IT companies. In response to questions on the problems faced by Indian IT professionals in recent past, Goh said a system should be evolved to ensure that the talent, especially the IT talent, stayed within Asia and was not lost to other countries like the US.

In his speech the Singapore Prime Minister said Free Trade Agreements could serve as building blocks for other countries since they were easier to achieve. He however cautioned against losing sight of the multilateral process at the WTO. Goh expressed concern at the lack of progress in the WTO where the progress in negotiations had been slow. It was important for WTO members to muster the political will to begin negotiations.

This could be done by ensuring that the interests of the developing countries especially with regard to agriculture was addressed. While lauding India''s economic reforms programme Goh said foreign investors were watching closely and any signal of a lack of political will would make them move away to other parts of Asia.

14,A clash of two eras in Congress,"NEW DELHI: A crisis is brewing in the Congress, with two veterans of the Indira Gandhi era locking horns with two current favourites of 10, Janpath. Veterans K Karunakaran of Kerala and V C Shukla of Chhattisgarh are on the warpath, with the party leadership firmly backing their detractors and chief ministers A K Anthony and Ajit Jogi.

Shukla is reported to have built bridges with the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and is on the verge of quitting. As if in anticipation, the NCPâ€™s Chhattisgarh unit was dissolved on Tuesday. Karunakaran has put up a candidate to contest against Sonia Gandhiâ€™s choice in the Rajya Sabha polls in Kerala next Monday.

Already, the crisis has led to the resignation of Karunakaranâ€™s son and Kerala MP K Muraleedharan from the state Congress chiefâ€™s post. Muraleedharan is expected to meet Sonia on Wednesday to make amends with the leadership. But Karunakaran has not shown any signs of relenting and the leadership is not ready to give in to his â€˜â€˜brinkmanshipâ€™â€™.

The leadership did not even send an emissary to sort out the issue and has threatened disciplinary action against the MLAs if they violate the whip and vote for Karunakaranâ€™s candidate. The crises in Kerala and Chhattisgarh have a few things in common â€” the old guard has been Indira loyalists, closely associated with the Emergency and accused of being party to its excesses. Both represent the upper caste conservative face of the party in their respective states.

Though the party does not seem to be overtly worried about Shukla quitting, it is wary about the fallout of Karunakaranâ€™s belligerence. The BJP has not opened its account in Kerala yet and the upper caste Nair community, that Karunakaran belongs to, could become a natural ally of the BJP. Yet, the Congress leadership has so far been firm in handling the octogenarian, whose single-point agenda is to dislodge Anthony.

16,"DDA scam: Khattar, Risbud, Chander arrested","NEW DELHI: The Central Bureau of Investigation arrested DDA's commissioner (planning) Vijay Risbud and director (lands) Jagdish Chander from their residences. The CBI also placed the alleged middleman Dharambir Khattar, under arrest after tracing him to a hospital. The doctors did not discharge Khattar who is said to have suffered from a brain stroke. Khattar was traced to a hospital in Panchsheel Park few hours after he had moved an anticipatory bail application before a city court in the court. He had got himself admitted to Max Healthcare hospital. He was missing since April 27, the day CBI raided his office in Jangpura. A CBI official said: ''We had mounted surveillance on him and his family members. A watch was kept at his residence in Gurgaon as well as the office in Jangpura. His cell phone was also under surveillance.'' Khattar is the central figure in DDAgate land scam in which Sharma along with three other DDA officials accepted bribes running into lakhs of rupees for extending favours to a construction company, a hotel and a private educational institution. Khattar also has four plush guest houses, two farmhouses in Gurgaon and untold wealth. A CBI official said that some of his properties are yet to be traced. He is an accused in three cases which have been registered by the CBI. In the first case, CBI alleged that Khattar had helped former DDA vice-chairman Subhash Sharma strike a deal with DLF officials. Sharma had allegedly allowed the company to increase the floor area ratio for a building being constructed at Jhandewalan. The second case against Khattar is in connection with another deal which the he had struck between Sharma and Modern Public School. The third case was registered after the CBI learnt that Sharma and Khattar had allegedly accepted money from M/s APY Hoteliers for permitting them to run an unauthorised lift in a building in Paschim Vihar. While the CBI had managed to arrest most of the accused, Khattar had escaped the investigating agency's net. Finally on Monday the special court of additional sessions judge Prem Kumar issued a non-bailable warrant against him. On Tuesday, Khattar moved an anticipatory bail application. He claimed the CBI had flouted the rules of jurisprudence and that the media had convicted him by printing his links in the DDAgate cases.

17,Contract farming: Punjab pact with Escorts soon,"PHILLAUR, Ludhiana: Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh on Tuesday disclosed that his government has received Rs 5,300 crore from the Centre for wheat procurement scheduled to begin soon.

In an informal chat with mediapersons after annual passing out parade at Maharaja Ranjit Singh Police Academy here, the CM also disclosed that his government would be signing an agreement with Escorts in the contract farming programme on Wednesday to give boost to diversification in agriculture. This would be in continuation with such agreements signed earlier with big business houses like Mahindras and others.

Sharing experiences of the recent agriculture summit at Mumbai, Amarinder said though no formal commitments were made but more than 500 industrial houses had shown willingness to support the contract farming programme. The chief minister had presented Punjab''s case for investment in agriculture and had made an impassioned appeal to industrial houses to help the state tide over crisis in agriculture.

Regarding fiscal health of the state economy, Amarinder expressed confidence that the steps taken by his government, though may seem unpopular for the time being, would yield results in the long run. The gap between income and expenditure has been reduced, he pointed out adding that though the situation has shown definite improvement but much remains to be done.

When asked, he did not attach much importance to the reported unity efforts between Badal and Tohra-led Akali outfits. The CM asserted that his party does not look at the development with awe as is being made out. Breaking and uniting is cyclic process with the Akalis, he said. Responding to a query about a DIG level Punjab police officer sent abroad to collect evidence of overseas property amassed by Badal, Amarinder while categorically denying this said the officer has gone for personal reasons.

However, he declined to disclose progress made in the investigations about Badal''s assets while reiterating that action would be initiated as soon as probe is over.

Amarinder said the chairpersons of various boards and corporations would be appointed soon but declined to give any timeframe for this. He spoke about going to Delhi in this regard but quickly retracted saying that the visit was not related to this.

About allowing kidney transplantation, he said his government does not intend to stop the practice but some sort of mechanism has to be evolved to ensure that system was not abused by vested interests.

18,Bhinder Cong's favourite for Gurdaspur LS polls,"PATHANKOT: With all the Gurdaspur district municipal councillors in the Congress kitty, former Union minister and senior party leader Sukhbans Kaur Bhinder has emerged as a supremo. Closest rival Ashwini Kumar has been further marginalised, not to pose any threat to Bhinder for the Lok Sabha ticket in the coming elections next year.

Party insiders said Ashwini Kumar had been elected to Rajya Sabha based on the Congress high commandâ€™s formula that he would not stake claims to the Gurdaspur Lok Sabha (LS) seat. This left Bhinder as the sole contender for the seat. But having managed to get the party ticket for his loyalist Ashok Sharma, who won the Pathankot assembly seat, Ashwini Kumar had set up his own group within the district to avoid trouble from Bhinderâ€™s side. But, since Bhinder enjoyed good relations with PPCC chief H S Hanspal and chief minister Amarinder Singh, she managed to sideline the â€˜Ashwini Groupâ€™. Most of her loyalists were given key posts in the PPCC and one of her loyalist Rakesh Kumar Pammi was appointed Pathankot Congress chief.

Not only Sharma loyalists were denied party tickets for the Pathankot MC elections, his role was also reduced to that of a second fiddle in the subsequent Pathankot MC president elections.

With Bhinder strengthening her grip, Ashwini Kumar, who earlier used to visit Pathankot on his way from Delhi to his home town in Gurdaspur, avoided the stopover recently.

Political observers said since all Bhinder loyalists had been elected as president in Gurdaspur, Sujanpur, Dinanagar, Dhariwal, Dera Baba Nanak, Batala, Fatehgarh Churian, Sri Hargobingpur besides Pathankot, she had emerged as a supreme leader after the MC elections. She was earlier defeated twice by BJPâ€™s Vinod Khanna in the elections for Gurdaspur LS seat.

Sources said the royal contest for the Gurdaspur LS seat would be once again between BJPâ€™s Khanna and Congressâ€™ Bhinder. With only a year left for the LS polls, Bhinder would start visiting her constituency more often in future to consolidate her position.

Meanwhile, the faculty members of various departments of Mangalore University condemned the US-led attack on Iraq. They protested with a signature campaign. The barbarism unleashed by the US and UK on defenceless citizens is a crime against humanity and the international code, they said. The resultant anarchy is likely to lead to retaliatory sentiments across the globe. The faculty members said they believed that Iraq is not one man, but 27 million people and the Iraqis have as much right to live as Americans and the British. They demanded immediate halt to aggression and pull-out of US, UK troops from Iraq. Udupi: AICC secretary Ved Prakash on Tuesday said the US-led war on Iraq was without valid reason and in violation of all international norms. Prakash, who participated in the protest rally organised by Udupi District Congress Committee, said Iraq had been invaded even after both United Nations and Security Council appealed for peaceful negotiations to settle the issue. He demanded that the BJP-led NDA government which failed to come out with its condemnation on America's war, should adopt a strong resolution condemning the barbaric war on innocent people.
