0,France for political process in Afghanistan,"new delhi: french special envoy pierre lafrance met external affairs minister jaswant singh and foreign secretary chokila iyer here on saturday to discuss future political scenarios for afghanistan in the wake of the ongoing us and british bombing of that country. while france supports the us war, it believes bombing alone will not force the taliban from power and there is urgent need for all interested countries to foster a political process that can unite the disparate opposition groups. in the absence of such initiatives, french officials fear the heavy bombing of afghanistan would only help to consolidate support for the taliban. in particular, they feel that the mounting civilian casualties in afghanistan will rob the us of moral legitimacy since people around the world will say ''terrorism is terrorism'' whether civilians are killed by commercial airliners striking buildings or by military airplanes dropping bombs and missiles on them. though paris recognises the northern alliance as the legitimate government of afghanistan, it is believed to be keen on a more broad-based set-up to replace the taliban as and when they are forced from power.

3,DF govt accused of being anti-labour,"mumbai: congress activist and trade union leader vijay kamble has accused the democratic front (df) government led by his own party as ``anti-labour and anti-people.'' mr kamble, who quit the nationalist congress party (ncp) and joined the congress here a few months ago, told tnn that thousands of workers were being retrenched by their employers under the guise of downsizing, but no effort was being made by the df government to deal with the situation. instead the government is busy taking ``pro-rich decisions'' like grant of total tax exemption to organisers of dandiya programmes and owners of multiplex cinema halls. ``unrest is fast building up among the working class and this could impact on the law and order situation. instead of responding to the situation in defence of the workers, the state government is trying to dilute labour laws. now a factory management employing up to thousand employees can summarily sack them with the full blessings of the state government. congress members are finding it difficult to face the working class because of laws like this,'' mr kamble observed. he also alleged that textile mill managements were being allowed to sell their land indiscriminately. ``mills are being given the nomenclature of processing units and permitted to shut down and sell the land to builders. a large number of millhands have become jobless as a result. the face of mill areas of mumbai have changed with swank offices taking the place of textile units which once upon a time employed thousands of workers. the df government cannot shirk its responsibility by merely blaming the erstwhile shiv sena-bjp government,'' he stated. mr kamble said the party organisation was being kept in the dark by the government about major policy changes. ``mpcc president govindrao adik has gone on record complaining that he comes to know of government decisions from newspapers. this is a sorry state of affairs,'' mr kamble stated. he plans to take up these issues at the national conference of indian national trade union congress to be held early next month in ranchi. ``i don't care if disciplinary action is taken against me for speaking the truth,'' he asserted.

4,"Fresh violence in Malegaon, curfew on","nasik: fresh arson hit maharashtra's powerloom town malegaon, which witnessed violence after the police prevented members of a community from distributing handbills after friday prayers that urged people to boycott us-made goods. the army staged flag-marches and curfew remained in force for the second successive day sunday. the death toll mounted to eight with one more person succumbing to injuries. state reserve police force personnel, strengthened by reinforcements, and police continued to patrol the streets after a few incidents of arson were reported during the night curfew, inspector general of nasik range khanderao shinde said. repercussions of malegaon riots were felt in ravalgaon, vadner-khakurdi, vadel, and karanj-gavhan in malegaon taluka, where rioters set on fire shops, gadi centres and small taparis. shinde said a few more persons were arrested taking the total number of people taken into custody to 137. he said curfew has been extended to 10 am monday and the army staged flag-marches in sensitive localities of the town. curfew has been in place in malegaon since friday afternoon. meanwhile, maharashtra chief minister vilasrao deshmukh, deputy chief minister chhagan bhujbal, mumbai congress chief murli deora and state minister rajendra darda toured malegaon sunday and urged people to maintain peace. deshmukh and bhujbal assured that an inquiry would be made to assess the damage caused to property in the riot. bhujbal said the government was making concerted efforts to ensure a regular supply of essential commodities, including milk. the administration's inability to prevent the situation from getting out of hand has caused considerable embarrassment to the congress with party president sonia gandhi slated to visit the state on monday. sonia is scheduled to visit the cm's home town, latur, to inaugurate a cooperative sugar factory promoted by his son. considering the prevailing situation, she is expected to visit malegaon too. maharashtra pradesh congress committee (mpcc) activists are worried about the political fallout of the riots. ''mpcc president govindrao adik and other members are working hard to ensure the party's victory in the ensuing local bodies' polls. any mishandling of the communal situation can politically hurt the party,'' an mpcc office-bearer said. however, another mpcc activist pointed out that the home portfolio was being handled by bhujbal who belonged to the nationalist congress party. police sources suspect the involvement of the student islamic movement of india (simi) in the riots. bhujbal was the first person outside the sangh parivar to demand an outright ban on the simi. meanwhile, the raza academy has condemned the police firing in malegaon. academy general secretary mohammed syed noori has written to the cm asking him to take stringent action against the ''guilty'' officials.( times news network & agencies )

5,Samata to hold farmers' rally at Hajipur,"patna: a state-level ""kisan rally"" will be held at hajipur on october 31 on the birth anniversary of sardar patel. talking to mediapersons here on sunday, samata leaders p k sinha and upendra kushwaha said the rally will be addressed by railway minister nitish kumar and other central and state party leaders. the two samata leaders said both the state and union governments have ignored the issues relating to the farmers of bihar. the rally will discuss such issues, including the perennial problem of floods in north bihar districts, non-functioning of state tubewells, frequent interruption in power supply to rural areas disrupting irrigation work, waterlogging and wasteland problems, absence of agriculture-based industries and the closure of jute and sugar mills in the state. they said the samata party intends to give voice to bihar farmers' grievances. out of the state's total area of 95.81 lakh hectares, 58.81 lakh hectares is flood-prone. 44.47 lakh hectares of north bihar's total area of 58.50 lakh hectares is flood-prone, they added.

6,Jharkhand officials unhappy with ministers,"ranchi: bureaucrats in jharkhand are unhappy because they feel that their ministers, who have neither the zeal nor the administrative skills, are treating them with disdain. some senior bureaucrats, sharing their feelings with times news network, said this lack of zeal, not funds, stands in the way of implementing the generous announcements made by jharkhand ministers. for example, the government announced to spend about rs 600 crore on urban and rural roads combined, but only a fraction of that amount has been approved by the state cabinet for the purpose. the lack of administrative skills on the part of the ministers is also evident from the way the transfer and posting of bureaucrats is being done. senior bureaucrats are suddenly transferred without any apparent justification. for example, three senior officials were shifted from the road construction, health and forest departments while some technocrats in the state electricity department with the dubious record of having caused huge losses to the state in the past have once again been placed on sensitive posts. this has been done because ""loot ki chhoot mili hui hai"", commented a senior official. regarding the fate of development projects, particularly the road ones, a senior official, on the condition of anonymity, said usually october to june is the working period. the state government announced to spend a huge sum on different kinds of roads. all this sounds good, particularly from a public platform. but the ground realities are somewhat different. during april-september, only rs 100 crore was cleared, and out of this rs 70 crore was approved by the cabinet. however till a few days ago, estimates of the schemes worth even rs 10 crore were not ready. the process of preparing detailed project report itself is time-taking. first the sanction, then comes the process of inviting tenders, and then a comparative statement is prepared. this is followed by approval of tender and award of the tender for a certain work. this whole process takes about three months. even if the process is speeded up, it would take a minimum of two months. so if this process is started immediately, even then a couple of months from the working period would be lost, the bureaucrat confided. besides, only rs 30 crore has been sanctioned to the road construction department. this means that most of the road projects would be delayed as has been the case with many other projects, some officials said.

8,"TUJS, IPFT merge to float new party","agartala: in a major political realignment, two powerful tribal parties of the state - the tripura upjati juba samity (tujs) and the indigenous people's front of tripura (ipft) - have decided to merge and float a new party representing the indigenous people of tripura. the merger assumes immense significance in view of the protracted tribal militancy in the stat and the ruling left front's fast eroding traditional tribal base. the ipft, formed on september 23, 1996 by a breakaway section of the tujs, routed the ruling cpm from its long-held tribal bastion and captured the autonomous district council in last year's election, allegedly with direct help from the underground national liberation front of tripura (nlft). on the other hand, the tujs- till recently an alliance partner of the bjp and trinamul congress- represents four segments in the assembly. it came into being 37 years ago on june 11, 1967. before the vertical split and emergence of the ipft, the tujs was considered the only tribal party staging political fight against the cpm's tribal wing gana mukti parishad. on saturday leaders of the tujs and ipft in a joint press briefing said that two parties would be working jointly until the unification is complete. they claimed that the new political party would be floated to represent the tribal people of the state and provide a strong and meaningful opposition to the ruling left front. a committee of eight leaders from both the parties would work out all modalities for the proposed unification. till then, a working panel of eight members from both the parties, will be in charge of political affairs. ironically, it was tujs which boycotted the adc elections last year alleging large scale violence on their leaders and workers by the nlft at the instance of ipft. ""we were from the same political body. but for differences on political issues we splintered away and formed the ipft,"" said debabrata koloy, former chief executive member of the tripura adc. ""now we have arrived at a political understanding and sorted out the differences to float a new party."" there had been tremendous pressures on the tujs leaders from the nlft militants to merge with the ipft for the past few years. there were threats on the tujs leaders' life. militants even kidnapped many samity workers including former adc chairman jagadish debbarma to exert pressure on tujs for floating a single and strong tribal party for the indigenous people of the state. earlier, the tripura national volunteers led by bijoy kumar hrangkhawl had joined the ipft even as the tujs leadership turned down the proposal.now it seems that keeping in mind the growing influence of the ipft and its own eroding political base, the samity leadership thought it prudent to change their stand. in view of the recent trend in the tribal dominated hills and rural areas, the proposed tribal party would alone be able to stage a decisive fight against the ruling left front in at least 20 assembly segments (out of 60) dominated by indigenous electorate. the ipft has already beaten the cpm in the adc and allegedly enjoy help of nlft militants, which with its sustained terror campaign ensures that the communists lose what is left in the hills. albeit, tujs had suffered serious political setback in the recent past following the split in the party, it has its own 37 years old base which will now come alive with the unification. that the proposed unification of the tujs and ipft would now pose a serious threat to already losing tribal base of the ruling left front is more than obvious. though the tribal leaders glossed over the question as to whether the new party would go for alliance with any national party, the congress which does not have any base in the tribal area seems more than eager to forge an alliance with the new party. the clp leader jawhar shaha met the tribal leaders of both the tujs and ipft last night itself to convince them for such an alliance for the next assembly elections.

10,Five baratis arrested for assault in Chowk,"lucknow: instead of reaching the mandap, a barat landed at a police station, when some inebriated members of a marriage procession assaulted a motorcyclist over a trivial issue in chowk on saturday evening. though the police rounded up five of the baratis who were not named in the fir, two of the named accused remained elusive as they were said to be close to some policemen at the chowk police station. the incident took place near khun khun ji road when the barat procession of a resident of lajpat nagar was proceeding towards munne lal ashram — the venue of reception. a motorcyclist, sidharth dhawan, a resident of chowk was passing from the scene when his vehicle reportedly hit one of the youths accompanying the procession. the revelry came to a stop as some of the baratis allegedly assaulted the motorcyclist before letting him go. the youth then reached home and informed the local chowk police regarding the incident. he also stated that the accused took away his mobile phone and a gold chain as well. the police swung into action. the barat was hauled up and even the dulha (bridegroom) was brought to the police station, while the accompanying band-party left in a huff fearing police action. the bridegroom was held up at the police station for several hours before the police managed to identify five of the baratis who assaulted dhawan. the five, pintu sardar alias kamaljeet, manoj kapoor, surjeet sharma, kapil deo and gulati were arrested and sent to jail. the police were on the lookout for two other named prime accused of the incident. what prompted the police to initiate such stringent action in a case of baratis assaulting a youth remains a mystery.

11,Rupee stages a mild rally against $,"mumbai: the rupee staged a mild rally against the us currency early on monday on light exporter dollar sales in an otherwise quiet and range-bound trade at the interbank foreign exchange market. opening on a positive note at 48.00/01 per dollar, the rupee later edged up and is currently quoted at 47.9950/48.0050, higher from last thursday's finish of 48.0050/0150. the forex market was closed on friday on account of 'dusshera'. bunched up dollar supplies accumulated over the long weekend were seen giving the rupee good underlying support, but dollar demand from state-run banks later in the day will prevent a sharp rupee rise, a forex dealer said. in cross currency trades, the euro was quoted at 42.94/96, pound sterling at 69.05/07 and japanese yen (100) at 39.14/16.

12,India's PC shipment dips 5%,"new delhi: india's personal computer shipments dipped five per cent to touch 4.48 lakh units during third-quarter of 2001 against 4.72 lakh units in the same period the previous year, even as china showed a healthy 12.9 per cent growth during the period. the shipments reflected a marginal 0.8 per cent growth quarter on quarter from 4.45 lakh units in the second quarter of 2001 to 4.48 lakh units in the third-quarter of the current fiscal, preliminary results by international data said. overall the asia-pacific (excluding japan) pc market reached 5.29 million units in q3 2001, representing a one per cent dip from q3 2000 but a two per cent growth from q2 2001. ""the year-on-year contraction reflected slower market conditions further exacerbated by the tragic events of september 11. excluding china, pc shipments plunged by nine per cent from a year before and a further two per cent from the previous quarter,"" it said. idc said that the current situation appeared to be even more severe as corporate replacement cycles were further stretched and any discretionary income are less likely to be spent on buying new pcs, and added that amid gloom china continued to be a beacon for pc vendors as the main fundamentals driving pc demand had not changed. chinese pc shipments touched 2.2 million units in the third quarter of 2001, from 2 million units in q3 2000, translating into a 12.9 per cent growth. compared quarter on quarter, this growth was to the tune of 8.2 per cent, from 2.09 million units in q2 2001 to 2.27 million units in q3 2001. commenting on the outlook, idc said that its revised forecast assumed that the asia-pacific (excluding japan) pc market would grow at 6.4 per cent for 2001, compared to a previous growth estimate of 10.7 per cent. while domestic demand growth would not be strong enough to fully offset the decline in exports, particularly, in trade dependent counties, it would be resilient enough to prevent the region from sliding into a recession resembling the crisis of 1997-98. ""the us economic recovery is expected to be delayed and asian economies are expected to resume their growth paths in the late 2002 or early 2003,"" it said. pc sales for the region are forecast to grow by 14.2 per cent in 2002, driven by the indian and cmarkets which are expected to grow in excess of 20 per cent, it added.

13,Smuggling increases through city airport,"kolkata: the inflow of foreign-made garments and electronic items in large quantities through kolkata airport is giving the customs department sleepless nights. according to senior customs officials, this inflow is nothing new, but the volume of contraband has increased rapidly in the past two years. they said that the lack of regular raids at the airport to block the entry of these illegal goods was responsible for the increased smuggling. they even said that some customs officials helped the carriers who brought in these goods. much of the contraband comes from southeast asian countries like thailand. bangladesh, which has become a transit point for smuggled goods to india, is another source. in a surprise raid conducted at the airport by the department recently, customs impounded 163 cases containing smuggled items and realised rs 21 lakh as evasion of customs duty as well as fines and penalties. under the customs laws, passengers are allowed to bring only bona fide or personal baggage. no baggage of a commercial nature is allowed, said sreela ghosh, commissioner of customs (airport and administration). the law was recently expounded by the central board of excise and customs after the famous 'ogla' case in delhi. incidentally, no customs duty is charged for personal goods worth up to rs 12,000. ghosh said that it was difficult to get tickets for southeast asia-bound flights because the seats were filled by the numerous carriers who, backed by the kingpins, fetched the goods from those countries. she said it was difficult to quantify the amount of goods smuggled to india because they went unchecked out of the airport. that the volume of smuggling has increased is evident by the availability of the goods in greater numbers in the local market, said ghosh. she said that the situation had become so alarming that it could take the shape of the 'ogla' case in new delhi in which 40 customs officials were suspended on charges of conniving with carriers. in this case, quite a few women from uzbekistan and other cis countries were acting as couriers for smuggling of textile goods to india. ghosh, however, added that the rate of smuggling had come down after the recent raid at the airport.

""we are also ready to settle over 3,000 families when the dam height is taken to 110 metre. the entire work will be completed by 2005,"" adds chudasma. the gpcc, however, insists that the state government has ""made little progress in the construction work thereby denying the people of drinking water and putting the burden of debt that the project is accruing with every passing day."" five separate rallies, starting from five different parts of the state, will carry ""kumbhs"" containing narmada water and converge at the dam site at kevadiya on wednesday. five congress leaders, including chaudhary, ahmad patel, urmilaben patel and shankarsinh vaghela, will pour this water into the main canal. the leaders will then address a public rally. meanwhile, keeping in mind the mayhem that took place last year at kevadiya, that saw the public torching three ministers' cars, the police are not taking any chances this year.

18,Modi yet to come to terms with local politics,"surat: narendra modi's maiden visit as chief minister to this silk-cum-diamond city on sunday amply suggests that he is still tuned to national concerns, thanks to his long innings in the national political arena, and is yet to come to terms with the ground realities at the local level. though he appeared to make himself aware of the local needs, the party's organisational local equations and expectations from the state government by the industry, but perhaps time and space proved to be major constraints for him in matters that could have projected him as well-tuned with local aspirations. hence, he banked upon jokes to prove the political bankruptcy the state had gone through since the last two decades and how the infrastructure sector was left unattended by the previous governments. he even took refuse in his exposure to national politics. no wonder, references to developments made by small states like himachal pradesh and the enormous potential of the information technology and bio-technology sectors in india, helped modi keep the audiences pensive at the reception accorded by the southern gujarat chamber of commerce & industry (sgcci). he admitted being out of touch with the local problems but as a seasoned politician he carefully crafted his responses to the queries posed by industry representatives. on an airport and a trade centre, modi assured that things are underway. political observers say the new chief minister needs to do a lot of table work and the right kind of advisors to make him aware of the ground realities. during his visit, modi also inaugurated a bridge and the sardar patel smriti bhavan at varachha.

19,No secret ballot for RS polls: Cabinet,"new delhi: in what could become a controversial move, the union cabinet decided on monday to switch over from secret ballot to open ballot for elections to the rajya sabha, apparently to check the use of money power and cross-voting in the upper house elections. it also decided to do away with the statutory requirement that a candidate for the rajya sabha should be from the state from which he seeks to be elected. this last follows the election commision's plea that the government must end the farce that was played by political parties, including the bjp and the congress. several of their top-ranking leaders have been getting elected from states they do not belong to by providing fake voters' addresses. the cabinet, therefore, approved proposals to amend sections 59 and 128 of the representation of people act, 1951, to ``prevent cross-voting and large-scale use of money power'' in the rajya sabha elections, law and justice minister arun jaitley said here. an amendment bill in this regard will be introduced in the forthcoming winter session of parliament. the minister said the cabinet decision comes in the wake of several political parties expressing concern over the large-scale use of money power and cross-voting in the rajya sabha elections at a meeting convened by the election commission in april 2000. jaitley claimed the samajwadi party, the bahujan samaj party, the telugu desam party and the shiv sena supported the changes, according to the minutes of the meeting. he added that major political parties had also favoured doing away with the provision in section 3 of the r p act which stipulated that a candidate for the rajya sabha polls should hail from the same state. he also added that the term of the constitution review commission, headed by justice m n venkatachalaiah, which was to expire on october 31, has been given an extension till february 28, 2002. so far, the commission has already made public as many as 23 draft proposals and wanted some more time to complete its task.
