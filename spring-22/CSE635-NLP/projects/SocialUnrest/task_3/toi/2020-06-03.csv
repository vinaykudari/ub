0,"Police shielding minister, says BJP","JAIPUR: On a courtâ€™s order, the police here have registered a case of murder into the mysterious death of state home minister Gulab Singh Shaktawatâ€™s servant but did not name anyone as an accused.

The case was formally registered in the Sodhala police station, hours after the chief judicial magistrate ordered police investigation into the complaint filed by the father and brother of Badan Lal Rawat whose body was found near railway tracks.

The state BJP on Tuesday alleged that the police were trying to shield Shaktawat. BJP spokesman Kali Charan Saraf said that the incidents that took place after Badanâ€™s death point out that the full police machinery is trying to save the home minister.

He said that the police had initially refused to file an FIR in this case.

When they finally filed it on the order of the court, they did not name anyone as accused, which clearly shows the intention of the state police, Saraf said.

He demanded the minister should quit so that the CBI investigation can be carried out without any ministerial influence.

3,AP politicians drop protest in Paragodu,"BANGALORE: Though Telugu Desam Party (TDP) members have dropped their â€œParagodu chaloâ€™â€™ protest on Friday, leaders of all parties from Kolar district will hold a rally in Bagepalli on Thursday to condemn Andhra Pradeshâ€™s â€œaggressiveâ€™â€™ stand.

Kolar Congress MP K.H. Muniyappa and MLC V.R. Sudarshan said here on Tuesday that APâ€™s approach to the issue was unacceptable. â€œAfter all, the barrage across Chitravathi river will serve drinking water needs of Bagepalli and Gudibande.AP is accusing us of diverting water for irrigation purpose,â€™â€™ they said.

â€œWe do not mind if TDP activists restrict their rally to AP. If they try to enter Karnataka, we will block them.â€™â€™ Sudarshan said chief minister Krishna will shortly take an all-party delegation to Prime Minister Vajpayee on the issue. â€œThe matter will be brought to the notice of AICC president Sonia Gandhi. We will appeal to our AP counterparts to withdraw their support to the TDP rally.â€™â€™ S.M. Krishna, in another news conference, accused AP of â€œalways politickingâ€™â€™ the water issue.

â€œI like to reiterate that the project is only to provide drinking water to 100 small villages and two urban areas and nothing else. But AP can continue its tirade if it wants to. Itâ€™s a free country.â€™â€™ Municipal administration minister Kumar Bangarappa said documentation for the project was â€œperfectâ€™â€™. AP has decided to send a team to Delhi to seek Centreâ€™s intervention on the issue.

5,Doctor flays govt. over Sars 'blunder',"PUNE: The scare over the killer Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) virus may be over in the city, but the scars of anxiety and social ostracisation faced by suspected patients are still fresh.

This was evident from a lecture on Sars, delivered by Dr Anand Kench of the Siddharth hospital, who not only helped raise a timely Sars alarm in the city, but was among the nine hospital staffers declared Sars positive by the government.

The lecture was organised by the National Integrated Medical Association (Nima) in the city on Tuesday. Recalling the personal trauma of the incident and that experienced by the respective families, Kench said, â€œThey should have at least informed us first. But they never bothered to do that. We learnt about it through media reports,â€� Kench said.

It may be recalled that Kench, along with several hospital staffers and patients, was under quarantine when state health minister Digvijay Khanvilkar made the announcement, about a month ago.

â€œWhile bureaucrats and others spoke of safety norms and flaunted hi-tech masks, we were provided with suffocating masks. Nonetheless, the monthlong turmoil and quarantine period taught us a lot,â€� Kench said.

6,Police fire as jailed MLA's men attack govt offices,"PATNA: Police fired several rounds in the air to quell a mob which ransacked the offices of the sub-divisional officer (SDO) and block development officer (BDO) at Piro in Bhojpur district and also set ablaze a government vehicle on Tuesday.

The violence took place when a mob of Piro MLA Sunil Pandeyâ€™s supporters, under the banner of Swabhimaan Bachao Sangharsh Samiti, were agitating against the arrest of Pandey by the Vaishali police in connection with a kidnapping case.

The mob first gate-crashed into the SDOâ€™s office and then broke the window glass and tore official papers. Later, they barged into the BDO office and damaged the furniture. They also set afire a government jeep parked on the premises. Police forces initially lathicharged the mob and lobbed teargas shells. As they failed to disperse the mob, the police fired several shots in the air.

According to reports reaching here, several persons received injuries due to the police action. Shopkeepers in the Piro market kept their shutters down when the MLAâ€™s supporters moved in the town in a procession, the reports said, adding the shops opened after the police dispersed the mob.

7,CDRI trying to reduce the time of drug development,"LUCKNOW: Drug development process involves screening of nearly 3-4 million compounds, an investment of 20 to 25 years for a potential â€˜hitâ€™ to be discovered, exorbitant sums of money touching crores of rupees and the much higher cost of sometimes non-necessary animal experimentation.

Information revolution and technological advancements may now make this a thing of the past as the Central Drug and Research Institute and the Invenio Biosolutions (IB), for the first time in the country, launched their revolutionary Drug Discovery software platform, â€˜DDAssistâ€™ (DD Assistant) in the city on Tuesday.

Director, CDRI, CM Gupta said: â€œIn this era of intense competition DDAssist will expedite drug profiling by matching structures of active molecules or â€˜hitsâ€™ selected by biological screening processes. Using robotec informatics with structures already present to prioritise, we will make a scientific and informed decision on the development of new drug candidates at drastically reduced cost and time. Information will be available at the click of a mouse.â€�

The CDRI and the IB are in the process of patenting this application for worldwide marketing. Now objective decisions will be made on a solid scientific database, significantly reducing human error, thereby chances of efficacy of the drug are enhanced. Additionally, as only those drugs will be tested which have a potential, it will reduce the number of experiment and drug testing done on animals, which is good news especially in the context of vociferous protests by animal activists. In the CDRI itself the number may be reduced from 5000 animals to a few hundred. The two areas that will be concentrated on, for now, are diabetes and dyslipidemia.

Such databases will also be useful for drug development in case of cardiovascular disease and neurological disorders. The CDRI already has its own library of 15,000 molecules at various stages of development.

Sanjiv Sharma, president, IB, reiterated: â€œTo access such a database from a foreign library will cost one million dollars per annum also some of the material available is based on diseases prevalent in the west. An additional advantage is that we have reduced the inconceivably high cost of research by at least five times and, since the technology is indigenous, it will be customised for the CDRI and India-specific diseases concentrating on diseases like malaria, filaria and TB.â€�

With technological upgradations, the CDRI houses a Combinatorial Chemistry and High Throughput Screening laboratories for chemical synthesis.

Gupta also emphasised that the CDRI had the unique facility for storing information on â€˜withdrawn drugsâ€™ which have side effects. Such a database monitors toxicity, stages of development of drugs worldwide and drug interaction. Any compound that does not conform to the â€˜safeâ€™ parameters of absorption, deposition, metabolism and excretion will not be tested.

This will reduce chances of failure, reduce time and meet corporate standards and growing competition. While worldwide time taken for development of a drug is 12-15 years, in the CDRI till now the time taken averaged 15-20 years. Now using this revolutionary consolidated database they want to reduce this drastically to eight years.

8,US-64 investors to get cash or government bonds,"NEW DELHI: US-64 investors will get either cash or government bonds by June 15. And, most of the cheques and bond certificates have been dispatched. ""They have been send by registered post,"" a UTI spokesperson said.

Around 80 per cent of the 20 million US-64 investors have opted for the 5-year government bonds offering a tax-free return of 6.75 per cent. And, the rest have gone for cash.

The bonds will be listed on NSE and BSE from June 16 for trading. As the scheme ceases to exist from June 1, 2003, the trust has delisted it from the stock exchanges.

Investors who bought units from the secondary market from November 15, 2002 to January 23, 2003 at the prevailing NAV-based price, will get Rs 6.50 per unit â€” the NAV as on May 30, 2003.

These units are not covered under the special package. The unencashed units in this category will be transferred to a new scheme US 2002, at sale price as on June 1, 2003.

The US-64 was divided in three categories. The category ""A"" investors are entitled for a special repurchase price of Rs 12 during May 2003.

Category ""B"" investors are also entitled for special repurchase price of Rs 10 on May 31, 2003.

Investors under category A and B were given an option to convert their holdings into 6.75 per cent tax-free tradeable government guaranteed bonds. But, this bond was not offered to category C investors.

But, the tax free 6.75 per cent bond is equivalent to a pre-tax return of 10.38 per cent for corporates who pay a tax of 35 per cent. Even for the high net-worth individuals who pay 30 per cent tax, the 6.75 per cent tax free return is equivalent to a pre-tax return of 9.6 per cent.

As the prevailing return on the 5-year government bond is around 6 per cent, these bonds are already trading at a premium of 5 per cent of the face value. Sources said that the premium is likely to go upto around 12 per cent when the bond will be listed on June 16, 2003.

9,'Tea labour unrest? Declare lockout',"KOLKATA/GUWAHATI: This is not just another storm in a tea cup. The killing of the deputy and assistant managers of Sapoi tea garden has forced tea majors to go into a state of alert.

Taking no chances, some companies have directed their gardens to declare a lockout at the slightest hint of labour trouble.

On the other hand, the labour workforce has upped the ante, stating that the tea garden managements had flouted an agreement signed in February 1996 that they would provide electrification of labourersâ€™ living lines in all the gardens within five years.The fear, among both workers and management is that Sapoiâ€™s shadow will haunt other gardens too.

Tata Teaâ€™s K.N. Desai said, â€œI do not think the Sapoi tragedy is the last of such things. There is every possibility of its recurrence.â€� According to Desai, garden managers are now caught between the â€œdevil and the deep seaâ€�. The threat from militants still persists. Now there is this additional threat from within the labour forceâ€�. The Goodricke management has urged all its garden managers to be â€œextra cautious and declare an immediate lockout in the event of any labour unrestâ€�, managing director, K.S. David said on Tuesday. Some tea majors are alarmed but are yet to view this as a reflection on the overall situation. Aditya Khaitan of Williamson and Magor group said Sapoi was an â€œisolated incidentâ€� and not a reflection of overall deteriorating industrial relations in Assam.

Meanwhile, Assam Chah Mazdoor Santha has accused the tea managements of not fully electrifying the labourers living lines, promised. ACMS secretary M. Khandait said, â€œThe electrification is supposed to have been completed within five years from 1996. Electricity, an essential need for others, has become a luxury for us.â€� Sapoi is a member of ABITA (Assam Branch of the Indian Tea association) but it did not have the electrification for the labourersâ€™ living lines, forcing the labourers to resort to unauthorised connections. This was the genesis of the Sapoi trouble that led to police firing, killing one labourer. It was also a precursor to the killing of the two officials of the garden.

The unrest is bound to increase as the tea outfits are finding it impossible to bear the social responsibilities (as per the Plantation Act, 1951) towards their workers. Desai puts it aptly: â€œThe garden managementsâ€™ demand to increase productivity is not going down well with the labour force. The workforce not in a mood to sacrifice the facilities they enjoyed so long. They are not prone to change. Wherever there has been cost cutting there has been a problem.â€�

10,The 'Equator Principles' adopted by leading banks,"NEW YORK: Ten leading banks from seven countries on Wednesday announced the adoption of the ""Equator Principles,"" a voluntary set of guidelines developed for managing social and environmental issues related to the financing of development projects.

The banks will apply the principles globally and to project financings in all industry sectors, including mining, oil and gas and forestry.

The banks adopting the Equator Principles on Wednesday are ABN AMRO Bank, N.V., Barclays PLC, Citigroup, Inc., Credit Lyonnais, Credit Suisse Group, HVB Group, Rabobank, Royal Bank of Scotland, WestLB AG, and Westpac Banking Corporation.

Together, these banks underwrote approximately 14.5 billion dollars of project loans in 2002, representing approximately 30 per cent of the project loan syndication market globally.

A bank adopting the ""Equator Principles,"" undertakes to provide loans only to projects whose sponsors can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the bank their ability and willingness to comply with comprehensive processes aimed at ensuring that projects are developed in a socially responsible manner and according to sound environmental management practices.

The Equator Principles are based on the policies and guidelines of the World Bank and International Finance Corporation (IFC).

The banks received extensive advice and guidance from IFC, the private-sector investment arm of the World Bank, in drafting the Equator Principles, IFC said.

11,Indian researcher challenges Newton's law,"KOLKATA: An Indian research technologist in Australia has challenged Newton''s First Law of Motion and called for a revision of the classical theory in the light of modern technology.

An alumnus of the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, Arindam Banerjee, working for Telstra in Melbourne, has contended in his recently published book ''To The Stars!'' that contrary to the hitherto accepted theory, an object can actually be moved without application of any external force.

""Central to my new theory is the proposal that our understanding of Newton''s First Law of Motion should be revised,"" the 47-year-old research technologist said.

Using his unconventional theory, Banerjee has described in a technical paper, what he calls, a design for ''perpetual motion machines'' which can generate energy without burning any kind of fossil fuel or any radioactive process.

The Internal Force Engine, which Banerjee has designed, never runs out of power because it is ''self charging'' without the need for any external source of energy.

""It is a machine derived from energy internal to the body and can achieve unlimited kinetic energy within a short span of time, using much less energy obtained from external sources like a battery,"" he said.

The balance energy generated thus is free and could be produced indefinitely if a feedback loop is created in the system, Banerjee contended.

The technologist has created an eletromagnetically moved Internal Force Moved Body (IFMB) which demonstrates that objects can be made to move from rest without friction, without expelling mass at high speed (as in rockets) or without any externally applied force, thus violating Newton''s First Law of Motion.

Through a series of complex cycles inside a hydraulic system that channelise oppositely directed kinetic energies inside it, Banerjee''s highly technical IFMB produces ever increasing velocity with each cycle with ''no upper limit'' to the velocity that it can reach.

Though his theory is based on the assumption that our present understanding of the Law of Conservation is flawed, Banerjee added that certain new concepts arising out of his own postulations would have to get firm footing first.

""For instance, the concept of ''internal force'', ''internal force moved body'' and ''velocity addition'' as proposed in the new theory would need innovations in the fields of electromagnetic and hydraulic systems,"" he said.

Successful implementation of the concept, fortified with designs and mathematical derivations, could mean a gradual elimination of the conventional sources of energy (fossil fuels) ensuring a pollution-free environment, the technology expert said.

The theory could also be used to describe the principles for the design of interstellar spacecrafts using the perpetual motion machine, Banerjee pointed out.

""Designing an engine that delivers more power than it takes to run has been a dream for all engineers. This concept has the potential to create a portable, cheap and no-noise machine to propel even huge systems,"" he said.

12,J&K govt not to invoke Pota in state,"SRINAGAR: The Jammu and Kashmir government on Wednesday said it would not invoke Pota in the state adding that the detenues who have no serious cases against them would be released.

""The government will not invoke Pota in any case. The government will not sanction or allow prosecution of any person in the state under Pota,"" State Housing Minister Ghulam Hassan Mir told the legislative council during question hour.

He said the government was considering releasing those persons who have been booked under the act but were not involved in serious cases.

Earlier, the Minister Of State For Parliamentary Affairs Abdul Rehman Veeri said no person has been booked under Pota in the state during the past six months.

To a query, Veeri said so far 168 persons have been arrested under the act in the state, of whom 86 persons have been bailed out on the directions of the competent courts.

He said Pota is a Central law enacted by Parliament and is not within the powers of the state government to abolish it.

""The state government has decided not to use Pota as a matter of policy,"" he added.

14,Developments in UP to affect NDA govt: Ajit Singh,"JAIPUR: Former Union minister Ajit Singh on Wednesday said the new political equations being developed in Uttar Pradesh after withdrawal of support by the Rashtriya Lok Dal to the Mayawati government would have national consequences affecting the Vajpayee government at the Centre.

""Four political parties - the Samajwadi party, Congress, RLD and Rashtriya Kranti party of Kalyan Singh - have come together to stake claim to form an alternative government in UP and this alliance could affect the politics at the centre and in states,"" Singh told media persons here.

Defending his party''s decision to join the coalition with BSP and BJP in UP that paved the way for formation of Mayawati government after the last Assembly elections, Singh said fractured electoral mandate forced his party to take the step.

""But we never forgot our issues and in the changed scenario. I now feel that a stable alternative to the Mayawati government can be provided which could have consequences at the national level too to affect Vajpayee government,"" he said.

He also demanded sacking of the Mayawati government as ""it had lost majority in assembly after withdrawal of RLD''s support"".

15,"Advani to lead BJP in next polls, says Vajpayee","NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee bowled a googly on Wednesday, indicating that Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani would lead the BJP in the next Lok Sabha elections.Just back from his three-nation tour, Vajpayee gave a new twist to the raging speculation on leadership, wrapping up his speech at a felicitation programme by saying: ""A self-confident nation and a self-confident party. Neither tired nor retired and Advani will lead the party to victory.""His audience at the function, organised by the party to congratulate him on his ""successful international tour"", included top BJP leaders and Cabinet ministers. Defence minister and NDA convenor George Fernandes was also present.As they sat trying to figure out Vajpayee''s characteristically open-ended statement, party president Venkaiah Naidu was on his feet and pleading: ""The country and the nation will remain under your leadership. Vajpayee is the leader of the nation, the NDA , the party; my leader and Advani''s leader.""Vajpayee''s stunning statement came on a day when BJP leaders were at pains to send out an unambiguous message that ""only the Vajpayee magic works"" and that he was the man who would lead the party''s campaign as the prime ministerial candidate. His statement in the evening was interpreted as many as a subtle rebuke to Naidu after his announcement a few days earlier that the party would project both Vajpayee and Advani as twin mascots.BJP spokesman Muqtar Abbas Naqvi, too reiterated after Vajpayee made his statement that he would still be the prime minister if the BJP won the next elections and that there was no contradiction as Advani had been in charge of previous elections too for the party.Earlier in the day, BJP leaders explained that the vikas purush versus lauh purush debate sparked off by Naidu did not involve a versus at all. It was about complementary figures, Ram and Lakshman, Vajpayee and his deputy L.K. Advani.And also that it was at the behest of state BJP presidents who met in Hyderabad recently, that the concept of branding Advani as lauh purush for the elections was adopted. ""It was felt by the state leaders that since campaign posters have both Vajpayee and Advani, the deputy PM should be projected too in slogans.""It was after the Hyderabad meeting that Naidu announced the party would this time project both Vajpayee, the vikas purush, and Advani, the lauh purush. The party''s electoral message has hitherto revolved around the universal appeal of Vajpayee.A party leader pointed out: ""It is very clear. Atal Bihari Vajpayee will be our candidate for PM. Advani is a second level leader both in the party and the government."" But, ""for Ram Rajya, it is very important for Lakshman to be there too.""Vajpayee''s statement also addressed the other controversy, speculation on his retirement plans after he was quoted as saying that he would retire if the peace process with Pakistan failed this time. The BJP has since clarified that the PM meant not making the effort again.",NEW DELHI
16,New grain export policy to simplify procedure,"NEW DELHI: The government is working on a new policy for the export of foodgrain. The policy, to be announced shortly, will aim at removing logistical bottlenecks as also making exports sustainable, says food minister Sharad Yadav.

Yadav told reporters here on Wednesday that the new policy will result in simpler procedures for exports and also take care of problems faced by exporters where procurement of grain and infrastructural support to sell wheat and rice abroad is concerned.

Notwithstanding the adverse impact the shortage of rail-rakes has had on exports, Yadav said India exported 122 lakh metric tonnes of grain during 2002-03.

Yadav also said that the Food Corporation of India (FCI) has been asked to liquidate within one month nearly 10 lakh metric tonnes of wheat which is three to four years old.

On drought, Yadav pointed out that the affected states have been given priority in terms of making foodgrain available to them. Stating that drought-affected Rajasthan was given the highest allocation, Yadav said the state was given 35 lakh metric tonnes of grain during the last one year. Last month alone, 5.12 lakh metric tonnes was moved to the state, he added.

Fourteen lakh metric tonnes more would be moved to Rajasthan this month and in July, he added.

As for the offtake under the public distribution system (PDS), Yadav said it has increased from 136 lakh metric tonnes in 2001-02 to 190 lakh metric tonnes during 2002-03.

This, according to the food ministry, is the highest level of PDS offtake achieved since the introduction of the targeted PDS in June 1997. The offtake by families coming under the Below Poverty Line (BPL) category has also increased from 117 lakh metric tonnes in 2001-02 to 160 lakh metric tonnes during 2002-03.

17,"Study links teen sex to depression, suicide","WASHINGTON: Teenagers who have had sexual intercourse are more likely to feel depressed and having suicidal tendencies than those who have not become sexually active, says a study by an NGO.

Early sexual activity, in addition to causing teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases, is a substantial factor in undermining the emotional well-being of American teenagers, Kirk A Jhonson of Heritage Foundation said.

Using data from a survey of 6,500 teens aged between 14 and 17 in the US, researchers found teen girls who had sexual intercourse were three times more likely to be depressed than girls who had not. Similarly, sexually active boys were twice as likely to be depressed than peers who had not had sex.

Suicide attempts were found significantly more common among sexually-active teens than their chaste peers.

""A lot of the safe-sex curricula in schools today are very focused on physical health aspects. We think that the safe-sex message to adolescents fails to adequately communicate the emotional risks involved in early sexual experimentation. Clearly, having more of an abstinence message is going to alleviate these concerns,"" Johnson said.",WASHINGTON

19,Lok ayukta indicts two Cong ministers,"MUMBAI: Lok ayukta V.P. Tipnis has indicted two ministers in the Democratic Front (DF) government, for â€œabusing their positionâ€™â€™ and protecting four encroachers on a plot allotted to an educational institution at Vakola, Santa Cruz.

Mr Tipnis wrote to chief minister Sushilkumar Shinde on May 30 that action should be taken against housing minister Sayyed Ahmed and minister of state for home (rural) Kripashankar Singh for â€œunjustly favouring the hutment dwellersâ€™â€™.

Both Mr Ahmed and Mr Singh belong to the Congress. An exhaustive report of the inquiry conducted by Mr Tipnis was submitted to the chief ministerâ€™s office on May 30. The report slammed Mr Singh,who is the guardian minister of Mumbaiâ€™s suburbs, for directing authorities to stop the demolition of illegal hutments despite the Bombay high court ruling that the tenants were encroachers.

In his defence, Mr Singh said, â€œI did ask them to stay the demolition, but asked them to verify if the occupants were residing before 1995. There is nothing wrong in doing that as I represent this constituency.My directions to the officers were only to follow the law of the land and not to evict legal residents.â€™â€™

Mr Tipnis took a serious view of Mr Ahmedâ€™s role in protecting the illegal slum dwellers. The report states that Mr Ahmed ordered that the encroachers be first rehabilitated by the state before their dwellings were demolished. Repeated attempts to contact Mr Ahmed were futile.

The case concerns 2,000 sq mt of a partly encroached plot at Vakola village, which was allotted to the Hind Seva Parishad by the state in May 1990. The additional collector (Encroachments) had successfully evicted the encroachers, barring four who obtained stay orders from the city civil court.

After the Andheri tehsildar served eviction notices to the four, the hutment dwellers moved the Bombay high court for a stay. In 1999, Justice D.K. Deshmukh rejected their plea. The long legal battle delayed the Hind Seva Parishad project to construct an all-womenâ€™s college.
