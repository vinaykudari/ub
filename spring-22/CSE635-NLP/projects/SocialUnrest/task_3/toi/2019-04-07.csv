2,Dam should have been built by govt: CAG,"ahmedabad: the sardar sarovar narmada nigam ltd (ssnnl) had incurred expenditure of rs 10,978.63 crore as of march 31, 2001 (fy01), out of which, rs 2,413.98 crore, or 22 per cent, was towards interest charges and servicing debt liability, says the report of the comptroller and auditor general of india (cag) for the year ended march 31, 2001. ""it was seen in the audit that the components of cost towards interest charges and debt servicing were not identified while submitting the original investment proposal to the planning commission. further, the revised cost estimates prepared in 1991-92 also did not indicate expenditure likely to be incurred on account of debt servicing and interest charges,"" the report says. ssnn''s reply to the cag (july 2001) was that the expenditure on account of interest charges pertained to ''interest during construction (idc)'', which is taken as part of project cost. the cag''s contention is that since the original cost estimates had not identified the borrowings as a source of funding, the question of expenditure on interest during construction does not arise. the cag report''s conclusion on ssnn functioning was ""the ssp was approved without outlining the sources of raising of funds and cost element towards borrowings. the company borrowed in an ad hoc manner and cash flow was not worked out accurately... there was no rationale for forming a separate company to execute the project. this work should have been done through a department of the government. there are no schemes for revenue generation for the company and the company''s main activity would be generation of assets and managing liabilities."" due to huge outstanding of rs 5,023.65 crore as on march 31, 2001, from all the four beneficiary states, ssnn had to resort to borrowings from other sources at rates of interest ranging between 12 and 18 per cent. this has resulted in an avoidable loss of interest of rs 1209.79 crore as of fy01 end. the cag report states that during the audit, it was noticed that a separate and specific permission was required to be obtained by ssnn from the state government for withdrawal of funds so placed in the personal ledger account (pla). as the permission at times was not acceded to, there remained an aggregate amount of rs 1381.30 crore as of fy01 end in pla. though this money was earmarked for ssnn, the state government did not permit ssnn to use it. so, ssnn had to borrow funds to the extent of above balance in pla and had to pay a huge interest of rs 220.77 crore from 1988-89 to 2000-01. due to non-reservation of right to redeem the bonds through a call option, ssnn would suffer an avoidable loss of rs 3033.45 crore by way of interest on redemption of these bonds on their maturity. against the anticipated revenue from sale of water and power of rs 22 crore per annum from 1995-96, no revenue was generated upto march 31, 2001. the planning commission approved the proposal for sardar sarovar project in october 1988 for rs 6,406.04 crore at 1986-87 prices. cost estimates were revised to rs 13,180.62 crore at 1991-92 prices, which were not approved by ssca/pc. revised cost estimates at 1996-97 prices are under preparation.

8,CAG raps J&K govt for diverting SRE funds,"jammu: the comptroller and auditor general (cag) of india has flayed jammu and kashmir government for absence of proper control mechanism, inadequate coordination, poor monitoring, over-statement of expenditure and diversion and misuse of funds in the concerned departments as revealed after a review of security related expenditure. the state government has not devised any accounting procedure to ensure correct and separately identifiable accounting of sre even though this special category expenditure is in vogue since the last 11 years, the cag report for the year ending march 2001, presented in the state assembly here yesterday, said. the outbreak of militancy in the valley in 1989-90 and the cross-border terrorism that followed led to deterioration in security scenario and put additional burden of security related expenditure on the state government, it said. to help the state combat militancy effectively and overcome financial constraints, the centre released security related grant-in-aid to the state government in lump-sum on adhoc basis till june 1994. however, certain specific items were identified by the central government for reimbursement in ''94-95 and sre was put on a firm footing, it said, adding later an sre parameters review committee was constituted in may 1998 for processing the item-wise and norm-wise reimbursement of sre. the committee recommended norms for reimbursement of expenditure for 25 security related activities including 15 items identified during 1994-95, from april 1999. the central government accepted the recommendations in may 1999 with minor modifications. the major items of sre were carriage of constabulary, security related civil works, rent of buildings hired for accommodating security forces, purchase of arms, ammunition, vehicles, material and supplies, the report said. expenses made under sre were shown in records maintained by the state government against which reimbursement was made by the centre, it added. the report said as per the records of the state government an expenditure of rs 1425.04 crores was incurred during the period 1996-97 to 2000-2001 against which, the central government had reimbursed rs 1294.50. however, according to the report, audit found that proper accounting system for booking the sre separately and distinctly in the account for its proper identification and reimbursement had not been devised by the state government. the test checks of paid vouchers and subsidiary records maintained by the drawing and disbursing officers concerned revealed that sre was inflated and overstated in the reimbursement claims submitted to the centre, the report said. audit scrutiny further revealed that in the estates department, expenditure was inflated mainly due to the booking of expenditure on routine estate works including their maintenance under sre.

18,Police use sniffer dogs to nab rioters,"vadodara: police are using sniffer dogs to nab rioters involved in stone pelting in various parts of the city. the idea of using sniffer dogs was discussed at a meeting of police officials and has been implemented since saturday. on sunday, police used a dog to try and locate miscreants who had pelted a few stones in the panigate area. police sources said in several areas people had alleged that police had been reckless in making arrests. at the same time, police officials had found it difficult to pinpoint the premises from where trouble originated. use of sniffer dogs is likely to take care of both the problems. ""police or people present at the spot may lie, but the dogs won''t,"" said additional commissioner of police keshav kumar. kumar said he had tried the idea during the 1992 riots in nadiad. ""there was stone-pelting from several narrow lanes and people used to escape when police arrived. we then decided to use sniffer dogs to track down miscreants,"" he said. the idea revolves around making the dog smell the stones pelted by miscreants. the dog can then sniff the area and identify the person who had thrown the stones. ""in nadiad, we could arrest 27 persons from a single premises using the technique. the dog ''salma'' had become very popular during the riots there,"" kumar said. now police officers have been asked not to touch the stones that lie in the street. police also called on people to take photographs or make video recordings of trouble in their area. if people co-operate with us and are vigilant, there will be documentary evidence against the rioters. we will have something on hand for conviction even if the witnesses turn hostile,"" kumar said. officials said those who help police by doing this would be rewarded.

19,Senior IAS officer quits disillusioned with govt,"gandhinagar: senior ias officer vijay ranchan has decided to quit the services six months ahead of his retirement. he put in his papers earlier this week. his colleagues say, ranchan decided to quit the services because he was feeling ""suffocated and uncomfortable"" under the current political atmosphere. one of the most seasoned bureaucrats, he has not revealed his future plans. when contacted, ranchan confirmed he had put in his papers, but refused to give the reason, saying, ""as seasoned bureaucrats, we refuse to comment on such issues."" ranchan, who worked as additional chief secretary, energy, when keshubhai patel was the cm, was suddenly sidelined and placed in charge of the state''s holy places. he was sidelined though he was never close to keshubhai, puzzling many ias officers in gujarat. at one point he was tipped to head the ipcl, a prized post he failed to get because keshubhai, acting under the advise of certain officials, brought to the fore a 15-year-old inquiry pending against ranchan as the state''s fisheries commissioner. as state''s energy secretary, ranchan was instrumental in clinching a $350 million loan with the asian development bank last year. adb officials hold ranchan in high esteem for his clear views on privatisation. ranchan is the second bureaucrat in the state to quit the ias of late. first was sanjay gupta, a young and energetic high-flying bureaucrat, who was also sidelined after narendra modi became cm. gupta had quit the services to join adani infrastructure as ceo. another bureaucrat, r k tripathi, has already told several of his colleagues that he will quit the ias sooner rather than later, and is said to be in talks with a big business house.
