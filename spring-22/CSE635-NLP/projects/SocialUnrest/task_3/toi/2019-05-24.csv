0,Girl arrested for murder of father,"ROPAR: The Anandpur Sahib police has arrested a girl and her lover for the murder of her father.

A case has been registered against the duo under Sections 302 and 34 of the IPC at Anandpur Sahib police station.

Both the accused, Sukhwinder Kaur Sukhi and Kulwinder Singh were on Thursday presented in the court of civil judge junior division, Karamjeet Singh Sullar, at Anandpur Sahib, and were sent to two days police remand.

Apart from the duo, the police also arrested two more persons, Manjeet Singh Bedi and Bhupinder Singh for concealment of the case.

Sources said Arjun Singh (the victim) an ex-employee of the SGPC, was running a cloth shop in the gurdwara market of Anandpur Sahib for the last 10 years. Arjun Singh, who was physically handicapped, had no issue and had adopted Sukhi about 15 years ago, when she was just two or three years old.

Being physically challenged, Arjun was not able to handle the shop alone and made her daughter Sukhi to sit on the shop, where she developed an illicit relationship with one Kulwinder Singh.

Arjun Singh who came to know of the alleged relationship of his daughter with Kulwinder warned her against it. As, FIR states, Sukhwinder and Kulwinder Singh both conspired to remove Arjun Singh as an obstacle, as well as in an intention to occupy the property.

The duo, then on May 15, 2002, killed Arjun Singh, while he was lying on his bed. Sources said that Sukhwinder caught hold of Arjunâ€™s legs, while Kulwinder tied a cloth around his neck and strangled him to death.

The duo then ran away to Kulwinderâ€™s village in Amritsar district after locking the door of the house from outside.

Two dayâ€™s after the crime, a foul smell began to emanate from the house, which prompted the neighbours to break open the door.

They found the body of Arjun Singh in a decomposed state. The police after registering a case, began the hunt for the two, and finally arrested them. The duo confessed to their crime.

1,Pasla’s group takes out rally,"JALANDHAR: Pasla group of Communist Party of India Marxist) sat in a dharna today to protest against the partisan role played by the police.

They demanded suspension of SP(D) under whose patronage a crowd of some 70 strong armed men of the Surjit group forcibly occupied the CPM office building after beating up and throwing out members of the trust and CPM Pasla group office-bearers.

Around 3,000 CPM workers gathered at the CPM office and Deshbhagat Yadgar hall today on a call given by the Pasla group.

They later marched to the DC office to submit a memorandum. They demanded that the persons involved should be punished and the charge of the building should be handed back to the legitimate trustees Harkanwal Singh, Mangat Ram Pasla and Kulwant Singh Sandhu. Cash worth Rs 1.25 lakh belonging to the office and associates should be returned along with three licensed guns snatched by the assaulting group in the presence of the police force.

They further demanded that the SP(D) under whose supervision the entire incident took place should be immediately suspended and all false cases registered against fellow comrades should be withdrawn. All attempts to arrest party workers to prevent them from joining in a protest in Jalandhar should be stopped, they added.

Earlier, police had attempted to enter Deshbhagat Yadgar hall on Thursday morning where the Pasla group had gathered to participate in the meeting. Freedom fighters inside the hall warned the police against entering the hall. SSP Paramjit Singh Gill said, â€œI received a complaint on May 21 that there would be trouble at the CPM office.â€�

Being short of force as there was trouble in other parts of the city, SP(D) Kulshinder Singh was told to handle the situation. As he was related to Harkishen Singh Surjit, he said with hesitation, he was bound to be blamed later so he ordered Kulshinder to go.

2,Army withdrawal scares riot victims,"AHMEDABAD: Apprehension is rife in the riot-relief camps dotting the city. This time around, the anxiety does not stem from any communal strife but the fact that their ''guardian angels'' -the Army men- have left the city to protect the country''s borders.

Abdul Hamid, who still remembers how he had escaped the rioters'' wrath while his house and belongings were reduced to ashes, said, ""Army is needed for our safety. We understand the compulsions that have drawn away the Army, we are ready to fight for our country, too. But, so long as we have to stay at relief camps Army presence is needed to ensure our safety.""

Hamid used to stay in the Baba Barkulla area of Shahibaug before taking shelter at the Dariakhan Ghummat relief camp. Co-ordinator of this camp in Shahibaug Ataullah Khan says: Though policing has improved in the past 12 days, absence of Army could spell trouble for us. Already this camp has been under attack twice. Army should have left Gujarat only after the Rathyatra.

A team of minority leaders, including Khan, had on Tuesday met police commissioner KR Kaushik to discuss the security aspect. And Kaushik''s assurances of maintaining peace notwithstanding, fears persist among the camp inmates.

""Top police officers have been replaced by better and efficient ones. But, those at the station level remain the same. It is this group that has inflicted maximum damage on us during riots,"" said Khan.

Mohsin Kadri, chief organiser of one of the largest relief camps in the city at Shah-e-Alam Roza, adds, ""I had called up the DIG police to prevent Army from moving out"".

Reposing faith in the local police was Maulvi Shabbir Siddiqui of the Jama Masjid. ""Ultimately it is the local police who will have to maintain peace. With the arrival of super cop KPS Gill matters are moving in the right direction.""

Abdul Karim R Shelat, an organiser of a relief camp that shelters 2,300 victims near Sanklit Nagar of Juhapura, said, ""Withdrawal of Army is a matter of concern but so long as CRPF or paramilitary forces are around in the present trend of ''professional'' policing , we are relatively safe.""

3,Modi favours October elections,"GANDHINAGAR: Chief Minister Narendra Modi strongly favours holding Gujarat assembly elections in October, a close confidant of the CM told Times News Network here on Thursday.The insider said elections in October would help the BJP as Narmada-based drinking water would have reached Saurashtra, North Gujarat and parts of Kutch by then. ''It would mean that the BJP will be fighting the polls not just on the Hindutva card. Besides, if we have a good monsoon, it will be a bonus for us,'' he said.Rather inflated intelligence figures are being quoted by sources close to the CM to say that if the polls are held immediately, the BJP would win 141 seats. References are also being made to a certain opinion poll which said that the BJP would get 121 of the 182 assembly seats if the polls are held right away.''And if we hold the polls in October, there might be some erosion, but according to our estimate, it would not be sizable. Even then, we will be able to win up to 110 seats. It is not advisable to wait longer,'' said a senior minister. Assembly elections are otherwise due in February 2003, before the term of the present assembly ends 10 months from now. It is not known how state BJP president Jana Krishnamurthy, expected here on May 30 to attend the state BJP executive meeting, would react to the CM's wish to hold elections in October. Modi had mooted the idea of an early poll during the thick of the riots but this was turned down by the Prime Minister.But not all ministers are sure the BJP will fight the elections under Modi's leadership and some are still speculating whether there would be a change of guard midstream to appease the NDA allies and also ward off criticism from other countries over the government's role in the riots. They sure want to fight polls as early as possible so that the fires of Hindutva unleashed during the riots remain alive to some degree.But the CM's camp is happy that the issue of leadership has been pushed to the background as violence in the state has abated after supercop K.P.S. Gill arrived on the scene. And, war clouds have shifted the focus from Gujarat. Even liberals belonging to the Suresh Mehta camp believe that Modi is the best bet for the BJP to win the elections.The threat to Modi comes from other quarters, mainly the Patel lobby, which is getting increasingly restive, as also an alienated state party leadership which has been complaining that the CM's style of functioning is highly autocratic. ''Under Keshubhai Patel, state BJP president Rajendrasinh Rana was silent as he was being given due importance, said a source.

5,Sena protests against state govt’s ‘apathy’,"MUMBAI: Shiv Sena leader Narayan Rane led a morcha of over 100 Sena activists and party leaders at Mantralaya on Thursday to â€œshake the state government from its slumber and highlight issues such as water scarcity and power cuts.â€™â€™

Sena MLAs and corporators from Mumbai who had assembled at Nariman Point on Thursday afternoon marched towards Mantralaya shouting slogans and protesting against the Congress-led Democratic Front governmentâ€™s apathy on issues concerning the common man.

The morcha was part of the Senaâ€™s statewide demonstrations outside the government offices.

Armed guards and police personnel immediately closed all the entry points to the seven-storey building and stopped the Sena activists at the main gate of Mantralaya.

â€œWe reached Mantralaya at noon and to our surprise not a single minister was present in his office. Chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh has been away from Mantralaya for the last four or five days. Many of the ministers and their secretaries are holidaying abroad and nobody is attending the office,â€™â€™ Mr Rane told newspersons at a press conference held later at Shivalaya, the partyâ€™s office in Nariman Point.

He said when the Sena delegation demanded an audience with the CM, messages were sent to the transport minister Shivajirao Moghe to rush to Mantralaya to speak with the delegation as Mr Deshmukh is said to be away in New Delhi to attend a party function.

The transport minister met the delegation and assured them that the issues pointed out by the opposition leader will be looked into.

â€œThe situation in the rural Maharashtra is very ccritical. Power cuts are regular affairs and the people have to stay in the dark for as many as 12 hours every day. The water situation is alarming and most of the villages are fed on tanker water as their water source has dried up,â€™â€™ Mr Rane said.

7,No govt flats for officers with houses,"KOLKATA: The state housing department plans to crack down on state government employees and officials occupying government flats despite having their own houses.

The number of such occupants is, however, yet to be determined.

In a circular (CN-386/100), the allotment branch of the housing department has asked all drawing and disbursement officers (DDO) to send in names of employees and officials enjoying government accommodation who have built or purchased houses with house building loans.

9,"Ensure justice to poor, Mayawati urges lawyers","LUCKNOW: Chief Minister Mayawati on Thursday said that court stay taken by the affluent with the help of money delayed justice, which was a great injustice to the poor.

She was speaking at a function organised in the court premises under the aegis of the Awadh Bar Association to felicitate the new advocate general of Uttar Pradesh Satish Chandra Mishra.

The chief minister said that with the rising aspirations of the people, the number of cases had gone up in recent years. But this, she said, should not be seen strictly in terms of increase in the number of pending cases.

Recalling the steps taken by her to revolutionise the legal system in Uttar Pradesh, the chief minister said lawyers should ponder over causes responsible for the delay in justice to the poor and prepare a paper on it. The government, she said, would make serious efforts to remove bottlenecks in this regard.

10,GO thrusts Aids on all govt meetings,"HYDERABAD: Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu on Thursday led by example in implementing a new government rule to enhance awareness about Aids in the state.

Naidu spoke on Aids awareness and prevention methods for over five minutes before the two-day collectors conference took off here.

This was in keeping with a GO (Ms No 228) issued on Tuesday making it compulsory for all ministers, collectors and heads of departments to discuss Aids prior to the commencement of official meetings.

According to the GO, it was felt that it was necessary to â€œmake it compulsory that a discussion on HIV/Aids be taken up before the commencement of all meetings to be chaired by ministers, secretaries and other officials in the secretariat, district collectors and officialsâ€™â€™.

Setting a trend, the chief minister spoke about Aids before turning his attention to routine matters.

Addressing the collectors and senior officials, the chief minister wanted them to â€˜break the silence and speak about Aidsâ€™. He said despite various measures, the state was unable to shake off the tag of being home to the second largest number of HIV positive patients in the country.

The number of people suspected to have been suffering from Aids has been pegged at 4 lakh.

â€œThis new programme is aimed at breaking the silence on Aids. The disease should be discussed in open forums so that more people would be aware of precautionary measures,â€™â€™ the chief minister said.

A joint statement by the DPG on the meeting said the US and India have charted a new course in bilateral relations which entails growth in cooperation on defence and security matters. During the meet, the two delegations approved a range of activities proposed by DPG subgroups responsible for plans for cooperating, including specialized training programmes and joint exercises to be carried out by armed services of the two countries during the next year; developing a defence supply relationship, including through Government-to-Government Foreign Military Sales programme.Highlighting the importance of the ongoing Special Operations Airborne Exercise in building interoperability, the DPG agreed to conduct further exercises.

13,CPM demands President's rule in Gujarat,"BANGALORE: In a departure from its stand on use of Article 356 to dismiss state Governments, CPM Central Committee on Friday demanded the sacking of the BJP government in Gujarat and imposition of President''s rule and decided to step up its campaign on the issue.

CPM had consistently opposed use of Article 356 but an ""extraordinary situation"" prevailed in Gujarat and it warranted invoking the constitutional provision to dismiss the government there, party politburo member Prakash Karat told reporters in his briefing on the committee''s decisions.

Charging the Narendra Modi government with ""brazenly"" violating the Constitution and working in ""an anti-secular fashion"", the party felt that no other state government since Independence had acted with impunity supporting those who carried out violence against the minorities, he said.

""We have gone beyond our earlier position asking for the removal of Modi. CPI(M) has consistently opposed Article 356 but in the present situation intervention can be done only through this.""

The committee authorised the Politburo to take steps to build up a movement by mobilising all ""secular and democratic forces. We will not allow Gujarat to disappear from the political map of the country,"" he said.

Gujarat had to be ""a matter of priority"" for the country, he said, adding while sharing the concern on the Indo-Pak tension, the party would not allow Gujarat to be ""covered up by any other issue.""

15,CPM denies hand in violence,"KANNUR: The district unit of the CPM, allegedly blamed for the fresh bout of violence that had claimed three lives since Wednesday, denied any involvement in the violent incidents and attributed the same to `inner-party rivalry'' in the BJP.

""Every time a party member is attacked, the main rival party is blamed for it and even the police come to such a premature conclusion without proper verficiation,"" CPM District Secretary E P Jayarajan said here on Friday.

Claiming that Uthaman, a BJP activist who was murdered on Wednesday night, was the prime accused in the killing of a CPM activist last year, he said the victim was also accused in several non-political cases.

Condemning Thursday''s bomb attack on a jeep in which two pesons, including a 70-year-old woman, was killed, Jayarajan said the CPM had nothing to do with the incident as Thilankeri, where the incident took place, was a `stronghold of the Sangh Parivar''.

Demanding a high-level probe into the violent incidents at Iritty, he said innocent persons, owing allegiance to the CPM, had been arrested in connection with the attack.

""There is no need for our party to nurture political violence,"" he added.

17,Is govt backing out on support price for areca?,"SHIMOGA: Thousands of growers who were cursing their fate for the steep fall in areca price in the state, breathed a sigh of relief when the state government announced support price for white chali areca at Rs 6,500 per quintal, a month ago.

But to the surprise of all, the order which should have been in force from June 1 is still a mirage and the state government is keeping mum over its decision.

To top it all, the growers are further depressed over rumours that areca will be purchased at support price from growers only through Campcos from Manglore and not with any areca co-operative institutions or private vendors who are running areca trade for the past 50 years.

In fact, the growers say that they have no stock at present to sell it to Campcos and the proposition is not at all tenable due to transport constraints. Only very rich growers who have the capacity and facilities have stored the areca.

Areca growers of Shimoga, South Canara, North Canara, Chikkamagalur and Chitradurga have formed a new federation of growers to fight the predicaments faced by them, especially fall in prices. They have already submitted a memorandum to the state and union government to come to their rescue.

R.M. Manjunath Gowda, president of the federation, said that the federation is holding a big convention of one lakh areca growers at Shimoga during September after the monsoon. He said they have urged the union government to ban the import of areca, allow the growers to sell their products through any cooperative societies and allot 50 per cent of tax collected from growers to the federation to allow it to maintain effective marketing system.

APMC''s in the state have been collecting hundreds of crores from the growers every year by leaving tax for every bag of areca marketed through them. But the growers have been expressing their anger that not even a paise is being spent to support them or help them reduce their sufferings. They are also urging the government to prevent the unscientific expansion of areca cultivation in the state and implement compulsorily the Agro-Climatic Crop Pattern in letter and spirit.

Though the state government has promised on several occasions that it will not let down the interests of important marketing economy of the state areca and that of growers, but still no positive efforts are in the offing nor any move to wipe out the tears of thousands of areca growers and lakhs of their dependents.
