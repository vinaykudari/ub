0,Ballot boxes may be back in rural polls,"BANGALORE: Mission over, nearly 80,000 electronic voting machines (EVMs), used in the recent elections, have gone into hibernation in strongrooms across the state.

A few of them will have to wait till election petitions are decided upon. Others wait for the next elections.

But, good old ballot boxes will have to return if the elections are held to local bodies. The Panchayat Raj Act still does not recognise EVMs. The Panchayat Raj Act, Corporation Act and Municipal Act will have to be amended to replace ballot boxes with EVMs.

C Chikkanna, outgoing state election commissioner, said, ""We have already sought amendment to the Act, but for two years it has been lying with the government. Until the Assembly gives its nod, ballot boxes will continue to be used.""

Over a lakh ballot boxes are in the custody of deputy commissioners and some spare boxes are with the state Election Commission.

Use of ballot boxes invariably means printing ballot papers, which will make green crusaders see red.

State election commission secretary B.G. Nandakumar said, ""It has become inevitable to use ballot boxes. Even if we are allowed to use EVMs, we do not have the fund to buy thousands of EVMs. We may have to approach the Election Commission if we are to use the existing EVMs.""

1,AP farmers need free lunches: Manmohan,"NEW DELHI/HYDERABAD: The man who once declared ''there are no free lunches any more'' made an exception for the farmers of Andhra Pradesh on Thursday.Prime Minister-designate Manmohan Singh certified chief minister Y S Rajasekhara Reddy''s free power for farmers as â€œprobably justifiable'''' in view of the distressed state of the agricultural community in AP.However, at a press conference in New Delhi, Singh made it clear that his support to interventionist doles was more as an exception rather than the norm: â€œThis (not levying user charges) cannot become a norm for all public services; wherever possible we must have the listed user charges.â€�Elaborating, Manmohan Singh said AP farmers had got a â€œraw dealâ€� for years because of drought and other policy variables.â€œTherefore I think some amount of comfort was necessary but that does not mean there should be no user charges,â€� he said and added that the burden to the state exchequer due to free power was manageable.Reddy met Singh in Delhi on Thursday, and in his chat with reporters later, chose to look at the bright side of the picture. He claimed that the PM-in-waiting had praised his government''s schemes, â€œincluding free powerâ€�.â€œHe (Singh) appreciated the ground reality in Andhra Pradesh and how farmers had suffered a great deal during the last few years. He felt that Punjab and AP were alike on this count.''''Though Rajasekhara Reddy isn''t really expecting any financial support from the Centre for his pet scheme, the latest endorsement by the architect of the country''s economic reforms has come as a shot in the arm for him and his supporters.Added to this, Jairam Ramesh is reaching here on May 25 to help the government devise ways to implement its assurances.",NEW DELHI/HYDERABAD
2,4 more farmers commit 'suicide',"HYDERABAD: Two days after chief minister Y S Rajasekhara Reddy announced a slew of measures for families of farmers who have committed suicide, a fresh round of such deaths were reported from different districts.

On Thursday, three loss-hit farmers reportedly committed suicide in different parts of the state, sending the district administrations scurrying to verify the veracity of the reports.

The three new suicides have taken the toll since Tuesday, the day the chief minister announced a Rs 1.5 lakh relief package for affected families, to 12.

Incidentally, the fresh round of suicides were reported on a day the government instructed all district administrations to open helplines and initiate remedial measures to prevent farmers from taking their lives.

Chief secretary Mohan Kanda asked district collectors during a video conference to set of official committees to re-enumerate all suicide deaths since 1998.

The administration should give wide publicity to measures initiated by the government to enable debtridden farmers to claim benefits, he told the collectors.

On Thursday, suicides by farmers were reported from Guntur, Anantapur and Kurnool districts. In Guntur, 40-year-old farmer Pulipati Sambasiva Rao of Tallur village of Phirangipuram mandal killed himself by consuming pesticide.

Sambasiva Rao owned two acres on which he had sown cotton and lost the crop, reports said. He then mortgaged his land and took on lease another piece of land in Errabalem village in Mangalagiri mandal and planted chilli but lost it too. Unable to repay the nearly Rs 2 lakh loan he took from moneylenders, he committed suicide.

District collector K Ramakrishna Rao said the mandal revenue officer had been instructed to verify the case.

In Anantapur district, Bayyapu Reddy (42), of S Brahmanapalli village of Mudigubba mandal who owned four acres, had taken private loans to the tune of Rs 1.5 lakh to sink borewells in his fields. Though he dug four wells, none of them yielded water.

Unable to repay his loans, he consumed monocrotophos and killed himself. The Anantapur collector said a team of revenue officials have been deputed to verify the details of the case.

In Kurnool district, Boya Chinna Kambaiah (45), a farmer of Jaladurgam village in Peapully mandal, committed suicide by hanging at his house on Thursday.

According to the police,Kambaiah was in heavy debts due to crop failure for three consecutive years due to scanty rainfall. He had two borewells dug in his field, but they did not yield water. The police suspect that the farmer committed suicide as there was no way he could clear his debts.

Collector Ajay Jain said an official team will visit the village to verify the case.

3,'CCL's profits hit by law and order problem',"RANCHI: The chairman of Central Coalfields Ltd, J P Sharma, has said interference by ""outside elements"" was affecting mining operation and urged the Jharkhand government to strictly enforce law and order in and around coalfields.

""CCL continues to suffer frequent and serious interferences in its mining operations by illegal stoppage of work from outside elements causing substantial loss of coal production and despat-ches,"" Sharma has said.

The public sector had registered all-time record in producing 37.34 million tonne of coal in 2003-04 and secured a net profit of approximately Rs 250 crore, he said, adding CCL contributed more than Rs 500 crore annually to the state government in the form of royalty and taxes.

The achievements would have been much higher had there been improvement in the law and order environment in and around its coalfields, Sharma said.

""We have a few areas of concern. We need support from the state government to look into law and order problem, release of land and settlement of land disputes retarding our march.""

4,Navy wants govt to seal Scorpene deal,"NEW DELHI: The Navy wants the new government to decide on the $2-billion French Scorpene submarine deal quickly since several submarines in its existing fleet are slated to be decommissioned in the coming years.

It''s also up to the new government to take a decision on the crucial post of Chief of Defence Staff (CDS), who is to act as a single-point military adviser and and will ""administer"" the country''s nuclear arsenal, Navy Chief Admiral Madhvendra Singh said on Thursday.

Denying there was any disagreement among the three Services on the issue of CDS, he said the decision about the post would have to be ""a political one.""

""It''s the government''s prerogative to decide when a CDS should be appointed. Seventy top military nations have it (the CDS post) and it has also been recommended by the GoM (the NDA government''s group of ministers'' report on reforming the national security system),"" he said.

As for the submarines, the Navy chief said it ""was essential to place orders for them now"" or India would land up in a situation wherein the older ones would be decommissioned without any replacement.

""The four German submarines in our fleet have, at best, another 10 years of life,"" he said.

Asked if the finance ministry had objections to the Scorpene deal, Admiral Singh said ""all arms of the government"" had agreed to the project. As per the plan, at least six Scorpene submarines will be constructed at the Mazagaon Docks Limited (MDL) in Mumbai.

5,"CMP to blend tough reform measures, development","NEW DELHI: The Congress-led government''s common minimum programme, whose finalisation was being expedited, will balance reforms and development so that tough measures like containing revenue deficit and cut in subsidies become ""painless"".

In a bid to provide social safety net, particularly to the 37 crore workers in the unorganised sector, the CMP may propose a two per cent cess on salaries of the organised sector employees to fund the insurance scheme in the unorganised sector.

The CMP, which will provide a roadmap for the economic policies to the new coalition government, may also propose to tone down some of the tough labour reforms like the ''hire and fire'' system as contemplated by the previous NDA government.

Congress has already circulated a draft CMP to its allies to be vetted by them. Prime Minister-designate Manmohan Singh has indicated that the CMP would be ready shortly.

Sources said many of the economic issues prioritised in the Congress agenda for action promise to push the economy on a higher growth path of eight to ten per cent.

Singh will have to do a tight-rope walk on the mounting petroleum subsidy bill issue with the global crude prices hovering around 40 dollars a barrel and the Left parties'' reluctance to support any hike in diesel and LPG prices.

He has already indicated that cross-subsidisation could be one of the options, particularly in areas where user charges are not levied like supply of free power to farmers.

9,Post poll clashes in West Bengal,"KOLKATA: Incidents of post-poll violence in West Bengal involving the CPM and the Congress may be a thorn in the flesh for a Left-supported Congress-led government at the Centre.

Irate West Bengal Pradesh Congress Committee leaders have met Chief Minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee with a memorandum and threatened to call a Bangla bandh in the coming month.

According to PCC leader Manas Bhuyan, more than 50 clashes took place between supporters of the two parties since the election on May 10. Four Congress supporters were killed, three in Murshidabad and one in Purulia, a Congress polling agent.

The situation was the worst in Murshidabad, where the CPM was defeated in all the three Lok Sabha seats in the district and also lost the zila parishad to the Congress. ""The CPM is desperate to recover the lost ground in Murshidabad,"" Bhuyan said.

The Congress party office at Khirpai in West Midnapore was attacked. The house of Nadia district Congress president Shankar Singh was ransacked, he said. Bhuyan said supporters of opposition parties were being attacked because the CPM workers was now trying to settle score with those who had not voted for their party.

CPM sources blamed the Congress for attack on a cadre who had worked in a Howrah booth. At Chakda, a CPM victory procession was also attacked by Congress supporters.

Politically, it would be convenient for both the parties if the friendship between the two in Delhi was not translated to the ground level in West Bengal, observers said. If the Trinamul emerged as the only credible opposition party in the state, all the anti - CPM votes would go to the party in the next assembly election.

Significantly, state police DIG headquarters Raj Kanojia said during the day that the police were yet to receive a formal complaint from the Congress about an alarming level of post-poll violence in the state. ""The situation is quite under control,"" he said.

According to Kanojia, the only serious incident took place on Thursday at Gokarna village in the Burdwan district. Two people were killed in a clash between supporters of the Trinamul and the CPM. ""It is an isolated incident."" He said it was possible that clashes over land disputes and other local quarrels were now being described as post-poll violence.

Bhuyan said, however, that this was not surprising. ""The CPM has a way of attacking its political adversaries under various pretexts, like land disputes, family disputes and personal quarrels.""

Trinamul leader Pankaj Banerjee said both the people killed in the Gokarna incident were supporters of the party. CPM supporters made an unprovoked attack on a Trinamul victory rally,. Banerjee led a delegation of party leaders to the spot on Friday.

10,Mulayam govt to file SLP,"LUCKNOW: Taken aback by the Allahabad High Court judgement, the Mulayam government may file SLP in the Supreme Court for the review of the verdict scrapping nine districts and four Mandals.

The chief secretary VK Mittal said that ""the option to file SLP in the Supreme Court was open with the state government"". He, however, hastened to add that the final decision in this regard would be taken after legal examination of the High Court''s judgment.

""We have not yet received copy of the judgment yet. The government would first legally examine the verdict and then take a decision accordingly whether to follow the court order or file SLP in the Supreme Court. Our options are open and a final decision would be taken by next week only,"" said Mittal.

Sources claim that the Mulayam government has already made up its mind to file the SLP as the High Court order would create many administrative difficulties including immediate postings of DIGs, DMs and district police chiefs in the districts and Mandals which were scrapped and now restored.

In a question, the chief secretary, however, denied that the state government was under pressure to issue orders for new postings following the court verdict. ""Since the copy of the judgment would be available only by Monday or Tuesday, it would be very difficult for the state government to take any immediate steps in compliance of the High Court order,"" he clarified.

Defending the government''s decision, the chief secretary claimed that the state government was saving about Rs 250 crores in salaries and allowances and an equal amount in maintenance and establishment costs of the new districts and mandals created by earlier government.

He also pointed that the newly districts and mandals did not fulfil the norms and criteria for the creating a new districts. ""The geographical limits, population and other important factors were not taken into account before creating these new districts,"" he added.

As per norms, a new district is created when the population is over 15 lakh and it has a minimum area of 5,000 square kms. It also requires a minimum of three tehsils, ten development blocs, 12 police stations, 300 lokpals.

12,Laloo hints at RJD joining govt,"NEW DELHI: In a softening of posture, RJD supremo Laloo Prasad Yadav on Friday gave ample hints that his party would join the Congress-led coalition government at the Centre saying there was ""some progress"" in his party''s demand for fair share in the ministry.

A day after the sulking RJD leader returned to Patna in a huff following negotiations on portfolios, Yadav came back to the capital on Friday morning and held a series of meetings with Prime Minister-designate Manmohan Singh and senior Congress leaders Pranab Mukherjee, Arjun Singh, R K Dhawan and Kapil Sibal as also NCP chief Sharad Pawar.

He also met Ahmed Patel, political secretary to Congress president Sonia Gandhi.

At the end of these confabulations, Yadav told reporters that ""there is some progress. That is why I am saying all this.""

""There was no tussle ahead of government formation. You will know everything tomorrow,"" he added.

""I have given a list of suggestions in writing to Congress leaders,"" he said without divulging the contents, but sources close to him said the Bihar strongman demanded a ""fair share"" of power for the allies.

""After all Congress cannot form the government on its own. It does need support of allies and must take them into confidence for stability,"" was his refrain all along as he tried to hammer the point tongue-in-cheek that allies could not be taken for granted.

Dropping broad hints that RJD would be in the government, Yadav said ""we all have to run the government together. This is a coalition government.""

Asked if he was emerging as a new power centre by trying to bring the alliance partners under one umbrella, he said there were many constituents having separate identities and their views must be reflected in the running of the coalition government.

Rejecting the suggestion that he was sore over not getting plum portfolios, Yadav said he was not power hungry.

""I have made four Prime Ministers and I am not Mamata (Banerjee) that I will get upset over small matters,"" he said.

Yadav, however, remained adamant over his demand for an economic package for Bihar and granting of special status to the state in view of its backwardness and poverty after its bifurcation.

13,Oil pricing will be discussed with new govt: Petro secretary,"NEW DELHI: Petroleum ministry will present all facts and data to the new government regarding oil pricing, following demand from oil firms for price hikes, in line with global firming up of crude oilprices.

""The pricing principle will be discussed with the new govt,"" petroleum secretary B K Chaturvedi said at a CII meeting on ""hydrocarbon strategy â€” volatility of oil markets - road ahead.""

Oil companies like IOC are seeking an increase of petrol and diesel prices as the sharp jump in international crude oil price since last month has eroded the over-recoveries from petrol and diesel to subsidise LPG and Kerosene. Petrol and diesel prices were last revised on January 1, 2004 and since then crude oil prices have jumped by over $6 a barrel.

Chaturvedi warned that an increase in oil prices will have a ripple effect on the economy and will drastically reduce country''s ability to invest and grow.

""Increase in oil prices will have a cascading effect on the economy, thereby affecting GDP. A 10% increase in oil prices will result in Rs 35,000 crore moving out of India, 2% of India''s GDP.""

Chaturvedi added that better fiscal management, provision of clean fuel and oil exploration development is the way forward for India to reduce effect of price volatility. He urged Indian companies to invest $ 1 billion per annum till 2015 for acquiring assets overseas and upgrading domestic operations.

Chaturvedi said one way of checking the effect of global oil price rise on domestic markets was to reduce customs (import) duty on crude oil and excise duty on product.

To sustain normal margins, price of LPG would have to be raised by Rs 101.79 per 14-kg cylinder and kerosene prices by Rs 5.68 per litre.

Considering the volatility in world market, Chaturvedi said that it was imperative to promote competition in the domestic market to get oil and gas products at international competitive prices.

14,IOC for Rs 4-5/litre increase in prices,"KOLKATA: Hit hard due to non-revision of oil prices since January this year, Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) is seeking a rise of Rs 4-5 per litre to offset the losses.

Marketing director of IOC, N G Kannan, told reporters on Friday that during the period from April to May this year, the combined loss of IOC and its merged subsidiary IBP due to under-recovery was to the tune of Rs 301 crore.

He said that the desirable extent of revision was Rs 4-5 per litre, adding that the matter would be left to the new government when it assumes office. Kannan said that the in 2003-04, IOC''s loss due to under-recovery in oil, kerosene and LPG was Rs 2,346.86 crore, while that of the total industry was Rs 4,337.50 crore. Subsidy in LPG only accounted for Rs 1,292 crore loss in the last financial year.

He said that the matter had been repeatedly taken up with the government, adding that commercial organisation like IOC cannot afford to lose money like this.

Kannan said though IOC was being compensated by refining margins, IBP was surviving only on marketing margins. To make the IOC brand more effective and visible in view of entry of private and foreign players, Kannan said that the company had already engaged two advertising agencies, Leo Burnett and Rediffusion, for charting out separate branding strategies for its retail, LPG and lubes businesses.

Besides, the two agencies would also build a corporate brand for the company as well. He said that the whole idea for drawing up a new branding strategy was to create an entry barrier for new players.

Talking about investment plans of the company, Kannan said the company would invest Rs 2,000 crore in West Bengal at the Haldia refinery, while substantial money would be pumped in Paradip-Haldia pipeline and Paradip Refinery.
