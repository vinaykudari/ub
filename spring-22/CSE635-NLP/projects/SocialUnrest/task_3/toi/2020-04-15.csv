He alleged that some PMC officials were hand-in-glove with the street vendors.

3,India sees gains in WTO farm talks,"NEW DELHI: India on Saturday saw gains in the modalities for agriculture negotiations underway at the World Trade Organisation (WTO), but pressed for more market access for its products, while making it clear that India would not agree to any dilution of the development focus in the WTO agenda set in Doha in November, 2001.

At the WTO''s mini-ministerial meeting in Tokyo, India, which fielded ministers Arun Jaitley and Ajit Singh, was assertive on greater market access for its goods and services, reports reaching here said.

The first draft of a paper on modalities for negotiations in agriculture was brought out by the chairman of the WTO trade negotiating committee (TNC) Stuart Harbinson after the ministers had left here for Tokyo, but it did not come as an unpleasant surprise.

In the session on agriculture at the Tokyo ministerial, the Indian agriculture minister noted several positives in that draft with regard to the Indian position on the various issues, but pointed out that ""the market access problems faced by countries such as ours with sizeable populations dependent on agriculture have been fully addressed"".

He further said that Indian negotiators would highlight those apprehensions later this month in Geneva.

Both Singh and Jaitley emphasised that any agreement on trade in agriculture must take care of the most urgent livelihood concerns of the farmers dependent solely on agriculture in developing countries.

""Our farmers cannot be redeployed elsewhere, and it will be difficult for us to support any reform agenda which deprives them of their livelihood and brings them onto the streets of our cities in search of jobs,"" Singh told ministers of 23 countries participating in the informal meeting.

Jaitley also spoke assertively during the session on market access in non-agricultural products and articulated India''s development concerns.

He said that for India with its diverse industrial base covering many products and different levels of technology, the development aspect in working out the modalities for negotiations of tariff cuts on industrial products would be vital.

Jaitley also joined issue with some developed countries'' ministers by strongly refuting their criticism that special treatment and implementation issues pertaining to existing WTO agreements were not matters of substance but tactics.

He made it clear that the implementation and special treatment issues were integral parts of the Doha ministerial declaration and cautioned that any attempt to renege from these commitments would mean unravelling of the Doha package.

""We cannot accept the view that issues of concern to the developing countries are less important than other issues or that there is a hierarchy of issues in the WTO,"" he said.

4,'Vote bank politics is the decider',"MYSORE: Karnataka Janata Dal(U) leader P.G.R.Sindhia on Tuesday said the Centre and all responsible persons at New Delhi failed to stand united and condemn the American war on Iraq.

Delivering a lecture, ""Iraq war and global consequences"" organised by progressive organisations, to mark the celebrations of Mahavir Jayanthi here, he said, every leader and his party was guided by ''vote bank politics'' and this prevented them from arriving at a consensus on the war.

On the consequences of war on Indian economy, Sindhia criticised the privatisation process being carried out by governments.

Noted legal luminary and academician C.K.N.Raja said, if one views it from an American angle, war is justified as no foreign policy has a human face.

However, largescale protests witnessed in America and England hold a ray of hope for people.

Writer Devanur Mahadev urged people to start a message campaign and send e-mails to American and Britons on the ill-effects of war on humanity.

Another writer and rationalist Ramdas in his speech said, the war on Iraq is multidimensional and it has many effects on countries and people at large.

5,Psychopath serial killer arrested,"MAHBUBNAGAR: The Mahbubnagar police have reportedly arrested a serial killer, who believed that all prostitutes in the world had to be murdered. Before he was caught, he murdered 12 women on National Highway seven in the last one month alone -- in Mahabubnagar district.

The killings created a sensation in the district. Only of the 12 women killed have been identified. Police suspected that they were commercial sex workers, engaged by the killer. The killer''s modus operandi was to engage a prostitute the highway and take her nearby bushes or hillocks kill her after having sex with her.

6,Jittery TDP chants development mantra,"HYDERABAD: The â€˜Praja Prasthanamâ€™ of Y S Rajasekhara Reddy has put the ruling party on tenterhooks with the government likely to take up development works on a war footing.

According to party sources, chief minister Chandrababu Naidu is likely to instruct party legislators and other elected representatives to identify works to be taken up in their respective constituencies and also release funds accordingly.

It may be recalled that Naidu had been reluctant to react to the â€˜padayatraâ€™ of Rajasekhara Reddy.

However, party leaders are apprehensive about the reports that there was widespread appreciation of Rajasekhara Reddyâ€™s efforts from the public.

In view of this, Naidu reportedly insisted that the ministers complete their tours of the districts prior to the Mahanadu in May to counter the padayatra.

The chief minister is also keen on encouraging the legislators to take active part in government programmes and accordingly asked party leaders to grade the performance of the legislators based on their participation in the â€˜Jalachaitanyamâ€™ campaign, the sources added.

The TDP politburo meeting, scheduled for Wednesday, is likely to discuss the drought, â€˜Jalachaitanyamâ€™ and training programme for party leaders.

8,Increase income limit for issue of white ration cards: CPM,"HYDERABAD: The CPM state committee has alleged that government lacked sincerity in issuing white ration cards to the eligible poor people.

The party said there were several loopholes in the memo issued by the civil supplies department last month on the guidelines for weeding out ineligible ration cards. CPM state secretary B V Raghavulu urged the government to immediately withdraw the same.

The CPM leader, in a letter addressed to chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu on Tuesday, pointed out that the memo has stipulated that ineligible white cards should be weeded out and white cards should be given to the eligible. However, the procedure to be adopted for cancelling the ineligible cards was not mentioned, he said.

As per the memo, the Multi Purpose Household Survey data should be used to determine eligibility for white ration cards. Not even a single white card would be left in the state, as the data showed inflated income figures, he added.

Raghavulu requested that the income limit for issue of white ration cards be increased to Rs 36,000 per year as per the World Bank norms from the existing ceiling of Rs 11,000 which was fixed 15 years back. Even for sanction of scholarships, the income limit was fixed at Rs 33,000 per year, he pointed out. The CPM leader wanted the chief minister to convene an all-party meeting to formulate the guidelines for issue of white ration cards.

9,We need value based politics: CM,"HYDERABAD: Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu on Tuesday stressed the need of value based politics and said, â€œPoliticians, instead of fighting for power, must be service oriented.â€�

People are tense as they are after money, property and are always trying to fulfil their material needs, he said. In this context it is important for young people to read holy books like the Bhagavad Gita, Naidu said.

The chief minister inaugurated the â€˜Gita Darshanamâ€™, a multi-media audio-visual art gallery at Ramakrishna Math on the themes of the Gita and Upanishads.

He promised support to the Ramakrishna Mathâ€™s project called â€˜Gyana Vahini,â€™ a mobile unit that will go to villages across the state to spread the message of the Bhagawad Gita. The project is to be launched on September 11.

An internetweb site, www.humanexcellence.org, was launched by the CM. Earlier, Ramakrishna Math general secretary Srimat Swami Smarananandaji Maharaj inaugurated â€˜Sant Darshanamâ€™, an art gallery of prominent saints of India. One must do their duty and be responsible, but should not worry about results and must not be selfish. This is what Lord Krishna told Arjuna, before the battle of Kurukshetra, he said.

10,Ajit to oppose I-T on farmers,"HYDERABAD: Union agriculture minister Ajit Singh reiterated his opposition to the Kelkar Commission recommendation to impose income-tax on farmers and the proposal to remove the minimum support price.

Inaugurating a workshop on agricultural policies for the 21 century on the occasion of Chowdhary Charan Singh Birth Centenary Celebrations on Tuesday, Ajit Singh said that despite repeated assurances the agriculture sector continued to be neglected.

Addressing the members of the workshop organised by the Acharya N G Ranga Agricultural University, he said there was a need to change the agricultural policies in tune with the change in times. He expressed displeasure at the nationalised banks'' failure to achieve the goal of giving 18 per cent of their loans to the agricultural sector.

Referring to the farmersâ€™-suicides, Ajit Singh said the high input costs and lack of credit facilities were responsible for the most of the suicides, especially by cotton farmers. He said the government of India had increased the credit amount to be given to the farmers to Rs 7.5 lakh crores in the Tenth Plan. In the light of the World Trade Organisation regulations and globalisation, the Union minister said he favoured contract farming and not corporate farming.

Ajit Singh dismissed the arguments opposed to agricultural subsidies and said that the subsidies to agriculture were far less compared to other sectors. He said that there leakages in food subsidies provided to the poor. Chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu also supported the Union minister''s stand on the issue of income-tax on farmers.

He appealed to the researchers and scientists to give suggestions to make agriculture a viable livelihood option. State agricultural minister Vadde Sobhanadreeswara Rao and International Food Policy Research Institute member Suresh Babu were also present on the occasion.

11,Brother slams Chandrababu Naidu's rule,"TIRUPATI: Nara Ramamurthy Naidu seems all set to launch a political platform of his own to embarrass his brother, chief minister Chandrababu Naidu, in the next elections to the state Assembly. He said he would try to recover the legacy of TDP founder N T Rama Rao by going to the people with promises of free power for farmers and 50 per cent subsidised rice for the poor.

In an exclusive interview with The Times of India on Tuesday, Naidu Jr. launched a blistering attack on his brother, describing the latterâ€™s seven and a half years in power as a â€œdark period in the stateâ€™s historyâ€�. The Chandrababu years, he said, began with an act of betrayal and were characterised by â€œa fraud played on the people in the name of hi-tech policiesâ€™â€™ and neglect of the basic tenets of welfare.

He blamed his brother for wrecking the agriculture sector and making farmersâ€™ lives miserable though he hailed from a farming family himself. The chief minister was â€œobsessed with corporate farmingâ€™â€™ and had much to learn from Tamil Nadu CM J Jayalalithaaâ€™s â€œexcellent policies in aid of drought-hit farmers,â€™â€™ Naidu Jr said, and complimented Congress leader S Rajasekhara Reddy for undertaking a padayatra in midsummer to highlight the peopleâ€™s problems due to the drought.

He said his brotherâ€™s governance was marked by high tariffs and failed missions on employment generation, water conservation and self-help by the people. His signature programme, Janmabhoomi, has almost become defunct although the government poured crores of rupees public funds into it.

Turning his ire on TDP general secretary Umareddy Venkateswarlu, Ramamurthy Naidu alleged that the former Union minister had swindled several hundreds of crores of rupees, and challenged him open debate on these â€˜scandalsâ€™. Naidu Jr also alleged that several other ministers and officials were misusing their power â€œNaiduâ€™s governmentâ€�. â€œChandrababuâ€™s rule is a dark period in the stateâ€™s history.â€™â€™

12,"State polls to determine Naidu, NDA ties","

HYDERABAD: With his ear to the ground, Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu, emerging from recent bypoll setbacks, is keenly awaiting the outcome of October assembly polls to see how far the incumbency factor will affect the political fortunes of his arch rival, the Congress.

Not that he is about to switch sides. But it will decide whether he should postpone the elections in the state by 18 months. It will also determine his attitude towards the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA), whose government at the Centre he supports from outside. As of now, it is status quo on both counts.

However, he is clear on one score: The countryâ€™s one-time king-maker does not want to be the future king. Naidu insists he does not aspire for a national role.

He fended off queries on all these issues while interacting with the media. â€˜â€˜Why do you want me to reveal my strategy 18 months before the elections?â€™â€™ he countered.

Naidu does not place his future plans in any timeframe. But he insists, â€˜â€˜I am totally engaged in my state. I have no aspirations to come to Delhi.â€™â€™

The approach is matter-of-fact, that does not over-emphasise the role of a state satrap and a regional ally of the NDA. He is careful not to send any negative signals.

This, at a time when the word in New Delhi is that Naidu, on whose numbers the Vajpayee government enjoys the majority in the Lok Sabha, is no longer the Centreâ€™s blue-eyed boy. His wishlist gets longer by the day, but there is a downswing in the millions he received earlier under various programmes.

Is there opposition from those who want more but have less capacity and lesser imagination to utilise Central funds? All he says is: â€˜â€˜If my state is able to absorb the resources and utilise them wisely, why should anybody grudge it?â€™â€™

â€˜â€˜I have good relations with the BJP. But I am not sharing power at the Centre,â€™â€™ he says. He indicated that as of now, he would not like to disturb the current arrangement.

Would he formally forge an alliance between his Telugu Desam Party and the BJP? He would consider it only on election-eve, he insists.

Is not the TDP concerned about the â€˜Hindutvaâ€™ platform that is gathering strength in the north? Naidu is silent. But those around him betray some worry. At the same time, they insist that they would be able to prevent its fall-out in the state. â€˜â€˜Slogans will not do here. We have enough work to show,â€™â€™ says Ummareddy Venkateswarulu, a senior TDP MP.

Naidu neither boasts, nor avoids talking about the widely perceived role of the king-maker that he has played for over five years now. â€˜â€˜They forced me, but I had refused,â€™â€™ he says referring to 1997-98 when he was pitch-forked onto the national scene. In politics, he emphasises, no two situations are identical, requiring identical action. But nobody knows what the future has in store.

15,Israeli surviellance equipment to be inducted in J&K,"JAMMU: With an aim to modernise the counter insurgency force in Jammu and Kashmir, the Rashtriya Rifles would soon be equipped with the state-of-art-technology, including Israeli night surveillance and body protection equipment, J and K Director General, RR Lt Gen Kapil Vij said.

""We are now equiping our forces with better weapons, equipment and communication system to take on militants during operations in J and K,"" he told reporters here on Wednesday.

These equipment included state-of-art-technology, night surveillance devices procured from Israel and body protection equipment besides some long and wide-range weapons, he said.

""Night surveillance devices would be used as an effective method during night long operations against terrorists by army jawans,"" he said, adding a large number of such equipment are being procured from Israel soon.

""This would increase in neutrilising more militants, even during night hours,"" he said adding body protections equipment would lower the casuality rate during operations.

16,KPCC president to submit report on RS elections,"KOCHI: Kerala KPCC President K Muraleedharan on Wednesday said he will not resign from his post and plans to submit on Wednesday itself the report sought by Congress High Command on just concluded Rajya sabha elections, which saw the ''I'' faction led by K Karunakaran putting up a candidate against the two ''official'' candidates.

Muraleedharan, who was here to attend a function at nearby Koothattukulam, cancelled his programme and was on his way to Thiruvananthapuram when he spoke to reporters briefly.

He said the Congress High Command had asked him for a detailed report of the election and he would be furnishing it ''most likely today itself''.

The KPCC President, who came under a cloud following his role in the run-up to the election, said ""I have been appointed by Congress President for the post and I will continue until she asks me otherwise"".

The anti-Karunakaran factions have been demanding resignation of Muraleedharan following his failure in convincing Karunakaran to withdraw the candidature of rebel candidate Kodoth Govindan Nair.

Three KPCC General secretaries have also faxed a letter to AICC President Sonia Gandhi demanding disciplinary action against Muraleedharan for allegedly working against the official candidates -- Vayalar Ravi and Thennala Balakrishna Pillai.

17,BJP keeps fingers crossed in Vadodara mayoral election,"VADODARA: What is rather curious about the present mayoral election is that everyone seems to know the results even before polling takes place for the hot seat on Thursday.

Gossips galore, the VMCâ€™s power corridors are abuzz with names like Vilas Surve, former mayor Ajit Patel, Praveen Patel and standing committee chairman Bharat Shah.

But quietly whistling in the dark, wooing Independent candidates, taking possible defectors for a treat to Diu, all in the hope to rustle up the required magic number of 39 is the Opposition Congress, which now claims to have equalled the BJP score with 35 supporters in its kitty.

While this declaration by the Congress may have roused fears of horse trading amongst the BJP, party sources in the Congress privately admit that even after close-door parleys and buffet meetings with Sahyog Party chief Shailesh Sotta Mehta, the Congress has failed to conjure up the required three seats to form a board. Senior Congress functionaries now fear stagnation after being in the Opposition since 1995.

â€œThe partyâ€™s continued stagnation for the past eight years can have a negative impact and can encourage defections in the future,â€� observes one senior Congress leader.

Tuesdayâ€™s close-door meetings of BJP councillors with party observers, sitting MLA Mayaben Kodnani and former speaker of Vidhan Sabha Dhirubhai Shah, saw most councillors demanding a candidate who belongs to the eastern part of the city.

However, party sources in the BJP indicate that a meeting has been called on Wednesday night at the chief ministerâ€™s bungalow, where senior party leaders like Jayanti Barot, party observers Mayaben Kodnani and Dhirubhai Shah, and state party president Rajendrasinh Rana would meet Chief Minister Narendra Modi to discuss the issue.
