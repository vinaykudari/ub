0,Why govt schools score over pvt ones,"CHANDIGARH: While four government schools, known for churning out toppers, have registered pass percentages of over 95 per cent in the CBSE class XII results 2004, two failed to cross even 50 per cent.

Among the top four private schools, three have registered cent per cent results. The fourth one scored 99.06 per cent.

Though government model schools in sectors 16, 33, 35 and 37 were the performers with high pass percentages of 98.45, 95.32, 97.12 and 98.6 respectively, the non-model ones in sectors 22 and 27 were the worst with 49.72 and 48.48 respectively.

In contrast, all the students who appeared in class XII exams from Sacred Heart School, Sector 26, Carmel Convent, Sector 9 and Vivek High School, Sector 38, passed. Interestingly, Bhartiya Vidya Bhawan, Sector 27, which had produced three city toppers in 2003, had one failure this time.

The number of students getting above 90 per cent marks were 12 in Sacred Heart, 6 in Bhartiya Vidya Bhawan and 4 in Carmel Convent while there was none in Vivek High School.

Among the government model schools, GMSSS-16 had 10 students getting over 90 per cent marks while GMSSS-35 had 12 while GMSSS-37 had none. Often lagging behind in hogging the limelight, government schools in the city fared well over the private ones, in tune with the regional trend, accounting for three of the four toppers in various streams.

Khushinder Sharma, principal GMSSS-35 which produced two city toppers â€” Tanvi Kiran in the arts stream with 93.4 per cent and Ashish Aggarwal in nonmedical with 92.6 per cent â€” said, â€œGovernment teachers are more experienced and stay with the school longer which gets reflected in the results.

This may not be the case in a private school. Providing good sports facilities to students and coordination among the teachers is also responsible for the feat.â€�

Reflecting on the trend,Ram Kumar Sharma, principal GMSSS-16 said, â€œWe maintain strict discipline and do not indulge in â€˜show-off â€™ in the name of extra-curricular activities. Our infrastructure is just up to the mark as compared to the private schools.â€�

1,"FDI policy will be liberalised, says Nath","NEW DELHI: Commerce and industry minister Kamal Nath on Monday said the UPA government would further open up FDI policy, especially in areas that will boost exports and create jobs. He, however, declined to go into specifics such as whether the sectoral ceilings in telecom and civil aviation would be raised.

Nath said PM Manmohan Singh would decide whether FIPB, which had been put under the finance ministry in the previous government, would now revert to the industry ministry.

The minister said the ""government''s intervention is not required for now"" in the foreign exchange market though exporters have been complaining about erosion of their competitiveness because of the hardening of the rupee against the dollar.

""The exporters should instead think of exchange risk management,"" Nath said. He, however, assured the exporter community that their problems will be taken up with the finance ministry. The rupee gained 5% against the dollar last year and in the first four months of this year, it gained another 5%.

Nath said government''s objective will be to achieve double-digit export growth on sustained basis. The minister said he will begin wide-ranging consultations with trade and industry from Thursday with a view to announcing the Export-Import Policy for 2004-05 by June-end.

Nath also announced that the Board of Trade will be soon reconstituted. He will also constitute a ""core advisory group"" comprising 20-25 of the country''s top exporters to deliberate on policy issues on a continuing basis. On the issues related to the current round of WTO negotiations, the minister stuck to the formulation in the first draft of the Common Minimum Programme of the UPA government. He said protecting the interests of India''s 650 million farmers will be the highest priority of the government in these negotiations.

2,"Chidambaram's key: Invest for growth, jobs and income","NEW DELHI: A regular budget for 2004-05 would be presented in the next Parliament session, said finance minister P Chidambaram, following ""a short recess after this short session (June 2-10)"". He said the government''s priority would be to pump in massive investment in agriculture and manufacturing. The aim: sustain growth momentum while seeking fiscal consolidation.

""My endeavour will be to promote investment which is key to growth, jobs and income,"" he said. ""We will find money for public investment and adopt programmes for private investment.""

""The two (massive public investment and fiscal consolidation) are not irreconcible,"" he said, adding the government would honour its commitment under the Fiscal Responsibility Act to cut down wasteful expenditure and achieve zero revenue deficit by 2009.

""Continuity of economic reforms is perfectly clear as we are going back to the original reforms of Dr Manmohan Singh...We would factor in the experience to carry forward the reforms,"" Chidambaram added.

India must shine for all Indians. He indicated that the ""India Shining"" campaign of the finance ministry was as good as gone. ""Was it a campaign by the finance ministry?"" he asked mockingly. ""To declare India is shining was, in my humble view, mocking at the poor of India. The poor have protested against such a campaign by voting NDA out of power.""

Chidambaram, however, stated that the ""Indian economy is in a resilient mode in terms of growth, inflation and BoP. I am confident that there is scope for consolidation of growth momentum with emphasis on agriculture, manufacturing and employment.""

""We want India to shine. This can happen only through good economics, good politics and hard work. I promise that under the leadership of PM Manmohan Singh, good economics and hard work. I think we can also promise on behalf of the UPA, that we will bring good and sound politics when we appraise and lay out the programmes and implement them,"" he said.

The FM declined to go into specific policy issues such as the interest rate regime for small savings. On the Black Monday market crash, Chidambram said, ""I am told that Sebi chairman Bajpai is looking into it. I expect to get his report in a couple of days.""

3,Legal terms redefined for new building bylaws,"NEW DELHI: Have you ever wondered while looking at building bylaws what a certain â€˜etc'' at the end of the sentence signifies? Nothing much, except a loophole called discretion that breeds corruption, say experts.

As a part of making building bylaws intelligible to the common man, experts are trying to ensure that there are no ambiguities or scope for misinterpretation, or ""discretion"" in the new set of rules.

As a first step towards this, the team working on the new bylaws is busy drafting a list of definitions for terminology commonly used in connection with construction of buildings.

""We are preparing a separate set of definitions. These terms already exist in various Acts. The main aim is prevent any kind of confusion due to conflicting definitions in different Acts,"" said MCD commissioner Rakesh Mehta.

And the terms in question are common enough. Words like land, building and covered area may be used loosely in daily parlance, but give a lot of grief once you talk of their legal implications. Did you know that land, building and covered area are all differently defined in the DMC Act and the DDA Act that are applicable in Delhi.

""Ideally, a term should mean the same regardless of the Act it is used in. But unfortunately this hasn''t been the case so far. This is joy for the lawyers and a lot of litigation takes place because of different interpretations of the laid law. We are looking at ending the scope of interpreting something. The bylaws should be crystal clear,"" said architect Sudhir Vohra, who is a part of the team working on the new bylaws.

The second aspect of the initiative will be ensuring that the definitions and amendments to the bylaws as well as the DMC Act are in complete harmony with other Acts that are applicable on building norms.

For instance, the Disabilities Act and the Delhi Fire Safety and the Fire Prevention Act.

""All these legislations are already in place and going by them all buildings built in Delhi should be disabled-friendly and fire safe, but unfortunately this does not happen. Although the Disabilities Act is there, the MCD has no mandate over it. As the civic body in the city it must have the power to implement these laws. And it can only happen if relevant provisions of those Acts are integrated in the new bylaws in a short but lucid manner,"" said a source.

5,"Steps to tackle suicides, PW","HYDERABAD: The government on Monday went ahead with its task of giving greater clarity to its policy framework when it announced more decisions to put an end to the spate of farmersâ€™ suicides, open negotiations with naxalites and examining key decisions of the previous administration.On a day when four more distressed farmers drank poison in Machlipatnam, Kurnool and Guntur, the cabinet resolved to set up a cabinet sub-committee to look into the issue.Emerging from a lengthy session of the state cabinet, Y S Rajasekhara Reddy said over the past 10 days 40 peasants had ended their lives. Of them, 25 had been driven to death by their debts. Ministers for agriculture, revenue, home and cooperation would sit in the panel which will look into factors that led to farmersâ€™ suicide.He ridiculed suggestions that the farmers had ended their lives to claim government exgratia and said: On May 26, the government will flag off a rally to create awareness among farmers about the schemes floated to address their problems.On another front, the government took the first concrete step to address the naxalite problem. It declared the setting up of a nodal team to chalk out the road map for talks with naxalites.The team would be formed after taking suggestions from intellectuals and people from all walks of life. This decision was announced after a law and order review meeting attended by the CM and police officers. Briefing the press, home minister K Jana Reddy said: â€œPolice officers have a positive frame of mind on opening talks with the PW.â€�Taking a firm step towards charting out its road map in the next five years, the chief minister later announced that all policy decisions taken after January 1, 2003 would be reviewed.Subject to assessment would be infrastructure development and tourism projects, land allocations of more than five acres and â€œthose which caught public attentionâ€� in the immediate past.â€œThere are several scams and allegations of irregularities in some policy decisions taken by the past government. These need to be re-examined,â€� he said.",HYDERABAD
6,Sulking ministers play truant,"HYDERABAD: In a reflection of the disquiet in the CMâ€™s backyard, three of his ministerial colleagues skipped the maiden meeting of the state cabinet on Monday.Those who played truant were N Rajyalakshmi, G Vinod and D Srinivas.On Saturday, Rajyalakshmi, wife of N Janardhan Reddy, touched off a crisis when she quit the ministry the very day she was sworn in.Her grouse: Her husband had been left out of the Union ministry.Vinod, who is G Venkataswamyâ€™s son, too is said to be grumbling for much the same reason and Srinivas is reportedly unhappy with his portfolio.A key player in this drama, Janardhan Reddy is camping in New Delhi. On Sunday, Sonia Gandhi reportedly called him over for dinner and assured him a ministerial berth in the next expansion of the Manmohan Singh team.Janardhan Reddy, who was instrumental in brokering the deal with the DMK, reportedly poured his heart out to Gandhi and told her that Rajasekhara Reddy and Ghulam Nabi Azad had tripped him. Vinod, who initially seemed just as resolute as Rajyalakshmi, relented on Monday.Still in the national capital, he went back on his decision to resign. He had decided to put in his papers to make way for his fatherâ€™s entry into the Union ministry and rushed to Delhi. But his father is understood to have told him to return and take charge of his ministry.Venkataswamy is apparently cut up with Rajasekhara Reddy for not having consulted him before including his son in the ministry. And yet, he has decided against broaching the matter with Sonia Gandhi.Srinivas, still sulking, opted to stick around in Delhi and peddle his cause and Rajyalakshmi apparently took a flight to the national capital about the time when the state cabinet was meeting.The CM, though, didnâ€™t sound unduly worried by this unwarranted absenteeism. â€œThings will fall in place in due course,â€� was all he had to say.",HYDERABAD
7,Traders protest against free-textbook decision,"PUNE: Maharashtra government''s decision to distribute textbooks for free among students of aided Marathi medium schools has left the Pune Booksellers'' Association fuming. Terming the decision haphazard, the association has decided to boycott buying both English and Marathi medium textbooks.

Addressing a press conference here on Monday, association president S V Joshi clarified that the booksellers were not against the free distribution of books. ""They should have done it in a planned manner, after giving notice to the booksellers so that they did not suffer financial losses,"" he said.

""As a mark of protest, we have stopped buying English and Marathi medium textbooks from the Maharashtra textbook bureau. We will sell the old stock,"" he said.

Joshi said booksellers have invested around Rs 2 lakh each for buying books, while wholesalers have put in Rs 10 lakh.

""Students who bought textbooks before the government announcement have started returning them and demanding refund,"" he complained.

Joshi said state school education minister Amrish Patel had asked booksellers to return the textbooks to the bureau by June 7. ""However, the minister said that we will get our refund only after two months. The textbook bureau does not accept credit, so why should we give them time,"" he asked.

Harish Kakade, member of the association, said the textbooks printed by the bureau after inviting all-India tenders were of substandard quality and full of mistakes.

He produced copies of the English medium geography textbook for standard III, where a mirror image of the actual page has been printed.

Kakade claimed that as many as 47 titles of English medium textbooks were not available at the textbook bureau.

Students will not get textbooks in time for the coming academic year, he warned.

Minister Amrish Patel had told TNN recently that textbooks would be given in time and that the quality of books would be good.

Sources in the textbook bureau, too, had refuted allegations about books were of substandard quality, saying that the booksellers and printers were raising a hue and cry because their assured profits have been affected by the state decision.

8,"Drop controversial ministers, PM urged","PATNA: The state BJP on Monday demanded that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh drop Bihar MPs with controversial background from his council of ministers and also ensure that Pota is not withdrawn, but its misuse prevented.

State BJP spokesperson Kiran Ghai said that the presence of controversial Bihar MPs in the government would only embolden elements indulging in crime, corruption and violence.

According to her, the indication that Pota could be withdrawn had emboldened terrorists, who on Sunday killed 29 people, including BSF personnel, along the Jammu national highway.

Stating that the Singh government was responsible for this, she said that the government''s declaration regarding withdrawal of Pota would send wrong signal that would not be in the country''s interests.

The NDA government had improved the situation in Jammu and Kashmir and had also paved the way for talks on peace with Pakistan, she said.

10,Sonia's citizenship issue: Persistent lawyer irks SC,"NEW DELHI: A Lucknow-based lawyer, who failed to persuade SC on Monday that Congress chief Sonia Gandhi''s citizenship issue should be decided by a Constitution Bench, narrowly escaped imprisonment.

A vacation Bench of Justice Ruma Pal rejected lawyer Ashok Pandey''s petition saying with Sonia Gandhi''s ""refusal"" to become PM, the cause of action did not survive.

Pandey had sought a direction to President Abdul Kalam not to appoint Gandhi as Prime Minister for she was a foreign national.

But Pandey''s insistence on having the matter heard by a larger Bench irked the judges who said that the issue had been decided by a Bench of the then Chief Justice A S Anand, Justices R C Lahoti and Doraiswanmy Raju on September 12, 2001.

Faced with dismissal of his plea, Pandey went on to say that the court was in the habit of dismissing petitions without hearing. The Bench then imposed a cost of Rs 20,000 on him.

While Congress-led alliance would have to accomodate ministers like P M Sayeed, Shivraj Patil (both of whom lost the Lok Sabha polls) and Oscar Fernandes (who retired from Upper House on April 2), BJP not only has the tough task of bringing big guns like Yashwant Sinha and Ram Naik (both of whom lost the Lok Sabha polls) to the Rajya Sabha but also has to see that party chief Venkaiah Naidu and senior leaders like Jaswant Singh, Pramod Mahajan and Arun Shourie get another term.

Another daunting task for BJP is to keep its promise of a seat to former chairperson Najma Heptulla in the Upper House. Formely from Congress, she joined recently BJP and will retire on July 4.

The vacancies in the Upper House include six from Andhra Pradesh and four from Karnataka. These seats have fallen vacant following the retirement of sitting members on April 2 which could not be filled due to the non-existence of the electoral college.

12,TRS likely to join govt in AP,"HYDERABAD: After successfully bargaining for cabinet berths at the Centre, the Telengana Rashtriya Samiti is all set to join the Andhra Pradesh cabinet and is also understood to be eyeing for the deputy speaker''s post.

""Our presence in the government will help achieve our goal of separate Telengana faster... It will be wise to join the government,"" senior TRS leader Santhosh Reddy said.

TRS, with 26 MLAs in the house had an electoral tie-up with Congress and nearly swept the Telengana region along with the left parties only with a handful of TDP MLAs returning successfully.

The Telengana party which won five of the six Lok Sabha seats it contested, has two representatives in the Union cabinet -- TRS chief K Chandrasekhar Rao getting a cabinet berth and his deputy A Narendra being Minister of State.

Rao, who was also elected to assembly from Siddipet and elected legislature party leader, will be quitting the seat.

It''s likely that TRS may ask for five cabinet berths in the state cabinet and also put forth its demand for deputy speaker''s post, party sources said.

Chief Minister YS Rajsekhar Reddy, who formed his 24- member cabinet leaving much room for expansion, left some of the districts unrepresented.

17,Modi govt continues to be on the defensive in assembly,"GANDHINAGAR: The growing dissension among the Bharatiya Janata Party members against the state leadership came to the fore in the state assembly on Tuesday when senior BJP legislator Mahendra Trivedi raised queries over acquisition of land by the Bhavnagar district collector in 57 land disputes, much to the discomfort of revenue minister Kaushik Patel.

The vocal member sought the minister''s explanation as to why the collector ordered acquisition within four months of his retirement when these cases were pending before him for past three years. ""What prompted him to expedite the cases so speedily, "" he asked.

Baffled by the difficult supplementary from the ruling party member, Patel said that decisions on land disputes have been taken as per rules and there is nothing wrong as feared by the member.

Despite pleas from some other ministers not to precipitate the crisis over the issue, Trivedi refused to budge and demanded that an inquiry should be made at whose instance the collector had issued orders in the land dispute cases.

As Trivedi argued that the collector had decided a majority of cases last month, the Congress members applauded the BJP legislator and demanded that the minister should order an inquiry. The minister said that of the total 57 cases, as many as 38 cases have been challenged in the court.

Patel, who also holds civil supply portfolio, was grilled by the Opposition members over issuance of BPL cards in Vadodara city. The Congress members alleged that according to their information some members of BPL familes, who had separated, were not given BPL cards and were enrolled as above poverty line( APL) cards.

At one stage, the angry members shouted slogans ""Garib virodhi sarkar nahi chalegi"". Sensing the mood of the Opposition, the minister readily agreed for an inquiry into the matter. Another minister, who had to face the fury of the Opposition, was state water resources minister Narottam Patel as he could not give satisfactory replies on villages supplied drinking water through tankers in Saurashtra and Kutch.

Senior Congress member Babubhai Meghji Shah and Shivjibhai Ahir charged that the government has failed to supply Narmada water to Kutch as has been stated by Patel. they said that several villages are still being supplied water by the tankers. Refuting the charge, the minister asserted that the government has succeeded in providing Narmada water to over 300 villages and remaining 200 would be supplied shortly.

Patel also denied the accusation made by Arjun Modhvadia of the Congress that the government has meted out injustice to Saurashtra in regard to drinking water facilities. He said that the government has reserved one million cubic water feet for Saurashtra and the same quantum was reserved for North Gujarat and Kutch.

Patel said that as against 2,500 villages only 500 villages are now being supplied water by the tankers.In last four years, more than 2,500 villages of Saurashtra and Kutch have been covered by the huge Narmada-Mahi river pipeline network which was a major achievement of the BJP government.

The newly-launched Sujalam Sufalam Yojana also came under heavy criticism from the Congress members who alleged that in the name of this scheme the government has spent huge amount in organising functions to spread the message of the scheme. The minister had to admit that the government had shelled out a whopping Rs 1.78 crore on organi sing ''kisan sammelans'' and other functions and publicity of the scheme in nine districts.
