0,Gandhi incomplete without Sardar: Modi,"KARAMSAD: Mahatma Gandhi would not have achieved anything had it not been for Iron Man Sardar Patel according to Chief Minister Narendra Modi.

Modi was in Karamsad on Friday along with Deputy Prime Minister L Advani on the occasion 129th birth anniversary the Sardar. Sardarâ€™s grandson Bipin Patel handed over the â€˜Bharat Ratnaâ€™ conferred on Sardar 1991 and few of personal belongings to the Sardar Patel Memorial Trust on the occasion.

Drawing parallels Modi said, â€œSwami Ramakrishna Paramhans would not have achieved greatness had it not been for his disciple Vivekananda. Mother was known because of Shri Aurbindo.

In the same way Mahatmaâ€™s struggle for independence would have been incomplete without Sardarâ€™s contribution in uniting small revolutionary movements across the country.â€�

Modiâ€™s comments have not gone down well with the Gandhians. â€œThis is like asking what is bigger, the stars or the moon,â€� said well-known Gandhian Chunibhai Vaidya. â€œThese statements have only one aim â€” to foist Sardar Patel over the Mahatma â€” because they donâ€™t know that it was the Mahatma who inspired Sardar to join the freedom movement. In fact the saffron brigade does not have any heroes which is making them project Bhagat Singh, Subhashchandra Bose and Swami Vivekananda as their icons.â€�

President of the Gandhi Parivar Trust Kanu Brahmbhatt said, â€œDuring times of trouble, Sardar always turned to Gandhi for advice. Todayâ€™s leaders are trying to marginalise Gandhi and glorify the Sardar. In reality it is not possible to isolate Sardar from Gandhi.â€�

Modi even accused the Congress of undermining Sardarâ€™s role in the freedom struggle, which was visible from the delay in conferring the title of â€˜Bharat Ratnaâ€™ to the leader.

â€œIt is an irony that Rajiv Gandhi was conferred the title even before the Sardar. It is a pity that they (Congress) took so long to decide. Even today if an average Gujarati is asked about the great leader he would always say that things would have been different had Sardar become the countryâ€™s first prime minister.â€�

Taking a dig at the Congress, Modi said the party was obsessed with a particular lineage of leaders and that they lacked progressive leaders like Sardar. â€œI have great respect for Sardar Patelâ€™s family who despite being descendants of a great leader did not take advantage of his position to enter politics. However, there are a few political fixtures in the country who have stayed put for the past four generations.â€�

Deputy Prime Minister Advani also spoke at the function. â€œNobody talks of Vithalbhai, Sardar Patelâ€™s elder brother who had played a principle role in the freedom struggle of the country,â€� he said. â€œHe was appointed as the countryâ€™s first speaker to the Central Legislative Assembly. He was a great philosopher and mentor of Sardar.â€�

The belongings of Sardar Patel that his grandson donated to the trust are a tea set gifted to Sardar Patel by Lord Mountbatten, a â€˜charkhaâ€™ and a shawl which the Sardar wore while he signed the final draft of the Constitution of India.

1,Modi sets his ministers a new agenda - fly kites,"GANDHINAGAR: Guess what is the future agenda for IAS officers and members of the Narendra Modi Cabinet? Flying kites!

Bureaucrats and ministers complain that the chief minister is increasingly relegating development issues to the background in order to get into the campaign mode,â€� with most meetings discussing ways to project his achievements â€” from flying kites with â€˜Vibrant Gujaratâ€™ slogans to projecting the first anniversary of his government on December 22 as the â€œturning point in Gujaratâ€™s historyâ€�.

â€œPolicy matters are hardly discussed in meetings these days. The CM is interested only in programmes and functions turning Cabinet meetings into event-management sessions,â€� says a senior minister, who did not wish to be named. Ministers say that burning issues like the poor state of health and education are hardly spoken about.

â€œThe last Cabinet meeting, held on Wednesday, saw the CM break into a monologue and a string of instructions rolled out regarding functions to mark December 22. He wants a superlative programme to highlight his one year in office as unique, a complete contrast to Gujarat under Keshubhai Patel. He also wanted a comparison between his governance and that of his counterparts in other states,â€� says another minister.

The instructions from the CM were straight and simple â€” a dazzling multimedia presentation of his achievements that the media can highlight. â€œThrash out the finer details with the chief secretary,â€� officers were told. And, it would just be the beginning, with a season of functions and festivities.

Come Uttarayan and the government plans to paint the sky saffron.

â€œâ€˜Patangotsav,â€™ to be celebrated between January 12 and 14, will be an occasion to tell the visiting NRIs about the Vibrant Gujarat programme. Kites, with â€˜Vibrant Gujaratâ€™ written on then, will tell the world about the success of the programme that attracted an investment of Rs 66,000 crore,â€� the CM told the Cabinet.

The Republic Day programme, to be held in Jamnagar, will also sing paeans to the government. The Cabinet, especially in its Wednesday meeting, has been focusing on this programme.

Ministers have been told that â€˜Vibrant Gujaratâ€™ should be the theme at the Republic Day too,where private entrepreneurs would be asked to make floats suggesting how Gujarat was the most important investment destination.

â€œYou should start working on this right away. You may hold programmes and meetings in Jamnagar with the local people to ensure that the function is a success,â€� the CM reportedly instructed.

On Friday, officers in the districts began another pet project of the CM â€” the gram sabha, being held in 18,000 villages till December 6, the Babri Masjid demolition anniversary.

All IAS officers are busy preparing notes for reports to be presented when they have an one-to-one meeting with the CM soon, to report on the â€œprogressâ€� made in their departments.

Ministers point out that if discussing and planning campaigns has become a virtual obsession with the CM, the inspiration comes from a number of programmes organised in the year â€” from the Gujarat Day celebration on May 1 in Vadodara, that saw thousands of diyas being floated on the Sur Sagar Lake and the Shiv Tandav and Shahasralinga puja at Patan on Independence Day to the Vibrant Gujarat show at various cities in the state.

2,"Suspend transfers, poll panel tells govt","BANGALORE: The State Election Commission (SEC) has taken Karnataka government to task for transferring 126 police officers including controversial Hassan SP Nanjundaswamy in blatant violation of the election code of conduct, which is in force for polls to be held to 1,032 local bodies.

SEC commissioner C. Chikkanna in a letter to chief secretary B.S. Patil on Thursday has asked him to stay all transfers till the election process is completed on November 12.

Sources said the issue came to light after Nanjundaswamy went to the office of the Bangalore DCP (West) to take charge. However, outgoing DCP (West) G.B. Chebbi, who has been transferred to Chitradurga reportedly showed him the SEC letter and did not hand over charge.

The government transferred Nanjundaswamy, four other SPs, 27 Dy SPs and 94 inspectors on October 30. On Friday, three IPS and one KAS officer were transferred.

Speaking to The Times of India, Chikkanna said: â€œI have written to chief secretary B.S. Patil on Thursday that the transfers effected on October 30 violate the election code of conduct, as polls for 1,032 local bodies were notified on October 13. I have said the transfers have to be stayed till the process is completed on November 12, as we do not know what the effect of these will be on the polls.â€™â€™

Chikkanna said: â€œThe CS himself issued a circular stating that there should be no transfers till November 12. But the orders issued on October 30 violate this. I donâ€™t know how it can happen.â€™â€™

Chief minister S.M. Krishna effected the transfer of Nanjundaswamy after former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda threatened to stage a dharna in front of his house and even lead a protest march defying prohibitory orders against the SP. Gowda has accused Nanjundaswamy of harassing JD(S) workers in Hassan district.

To placate Gowda, the government transferred Nanjundaswamy as Bangalore DCP (South) and had decided to post S. Bhaskar Rao in the present post to Hassan. When Gowda reportedly did not agree to Rao being posted, Chitradurga SP P.H. Rane was posted to Hassan and Chebbi to Chitradurga.

The transfers effected on Friday were: S.N. Borkar as DGP (COD, training, special units and economic affairs); Y. Seeladhari Rao, promoted and posted as DGP (prisons) and M.K. Srivastava, promoted and posted as ADGP (crime and technical services).

KAS officer C. Mohammed Khaleemulla has been transferred as Rajarajeshwari town municipal council commissioner.

4,State yet to get central incentive,"PATNA: Although Bihar government has succeeded in reducing the ratio between its revenue deficit and revenue receipt considerably during 2000-01 and 2001-02, it has not yet received Rs 127 crore from the Incentive Fund (IF) set up by the Centre on the recommendations of 11th Finance Commission, as it is yet to sign a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Centre, giving an undertaking to the latter to reduce the ratio by five per cent every year.

The state government had sent a draft memorandum to the Union finance ministry in July this year, expressing its willingness to sign an MoU with the finance ministry in this regard.

The Union finance ministry, however, returned the draft memorandum two months back, asking the state government to give the projected fall in the ratio for the financial year 2004-05. Apart from it, the Centre also asked the state government to send to it a projectwise action plan in this connection instead of in the form of a draft memorandum.

State finance commissioner U N Panjiyar on Friday said that the state government will comply with the central directive soon. Apart from giving the projected fall in the ratio for the year 2004-05, the state government would also be sending its projectwise action plan to the Centre, he added. The state government will soon sign an MoU with the Centre in this regard.

The state government will become entitled to Rs 411 crore from the IF if it succeeded in bringing down the ratio between its revenue deficit and revenue receipt by five year pecent every year during 2000-05. It has already become entitled to Rs 127 crore by bringing down the ratio from 34% in 1999-2000 to 20% in 2000-2001 and to 13% during 2001-02. The official figure for 2002-03 is not yet available, Panjiyar said.

During 2000-05, a fund of Rs 10,607.72 crore would be deposited in the IF. Fifteen revenue deficit states, which had received revenue deficit grant from the Centre on the recommendations of 10th Finance Commission, would be depositing 15% of their revenue deficit grant in the IF, with the Centre also releasing a matching amount. Bihar was not among the 15 states which had recevied revenue deficit grant from the Centre. Hence, it would not have to contribute to the IF.

The finance commission had recommended for creation of the IF following the demand of the Andhara Pradesh CM that states doing well on revenue and fiscal reform front should also be given some incentive.

5,Cong behind political pollution: BJP chief,"AMRITSAR: Newly elected Punjab BJP president Avinash Rai Khanna, on Friday, blamed the Congress for vitiating the political environment of the state and hurting the selfrespect of the people of Punjab by following â€˜â€˜vindictiveâ€™â€™ policies.

Khanna was addressing mediapersons on his arrival at the Golden Templeâ€™s information centre. Khanna led the Sadhbhavana Yatra dedicated to the 400th year of installation of Guru Granth Sahib organised by the Amritsar district rural unit of BJP.

Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee senior vice-president Alwinderpal Singh Pakhoke flagged off the Yatra from Darbar Sahib, Tarn Taran, which would pass through Amritsar, Meerankokt, Rajasansi, Ajnala, Fatehgarh Churian, among other places, before ending at Verka.

Khanna alleged that the Congress leadership was responsible for â€˜â€˜political pollutionâ€™â€™ in the state as they were engaged only in criticising former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal by ignoring development works in the state.

Khanna said that the relationship between the SAD and BJP workers was cordial. He emphasised the setting up of coordination committees right from the block level.

He also claimed that the BJP was gaining strength and increasing its mass base in rural areas of Punjab as against its reputation of being a urban and â€˜â€˜Hinduâ€™â€™ party. Khanna said that the BJP and SAD would contest the elections together and that the BJP would stand by the SAD through â€˜â€˜thick and thinâ€™â€™.

Anil Joshi, district rural president of BJP said that thousands of SAD and BJP workers from 500 villages were taking part in the 150-km yatra.

He said that the objective behind the yatra was to foster ties between SAD and BJP workers and send across the message of brotherhood. Pakhoke said that SGPC members and Akali workers supported the yatra and have also made relevant arrangements for them.

6,"Docs, lawyers, actors top tax evaders","HYDERABAD: Doctors, advocates and film stars have topped the list of professional tax evaders in the state. At the same time, tax defaulters are not confined to these professions, a vigilance department probe has revealed.

Not even 10 per cent of the 15,000 advocates practising in the city are paying tax, according to sources. Likewise, very few doctors and movie artistes are coming forward to pay professional tax.

In the case of salaried employees, the respective employers deduct the tax at source and pay it in the commercial taxes (CT) department offices. But getting other professionals who do not get regular salaries to cough up their taxes is a major problem for the department.

While doctors and film actors and directors are required to pay Rs 2,500 per annum as professional tax, advocates need to pay Rs 1,000 per year. Chartered accountants, race horse trainers, nursing home owners too have to pay Rs 2,500 per year.

During a routine investigation, it has been brought to the notice of the city vigilance wing that hardly any private security agencies are collecting tax from their employees or remitting the amounts with the government. The vigilance wing has called for a meeting with the agencies on their taxes, which range from Rs 300 to Rs 2,500 per year. An estimated 60,000 security guards are employed in private sector.

The vigilance wing has also shot off letters to the bar associations of the High Court, and other city courts, the movie artistes associations, and the Indian Medical Association asking them inform their members to pay the professional tax regularly.

7,"Muktsar police arrest 4 terrorists, KCF chief","BATHINDA: The Muktsar police claimed to have arrested five terrorists including a selfstyled chief of Khalistan Commando Force (KCF) on Friday.

The police have recovered three .12 bore pistols, many live cartridges and letter-pads of KCF from them.

They were using the letter pads to extort money from the people. According to police sources, those arrested are Paramjit Singh alias Pamma, the KCF chief and Jaskaran Singh, both of Chak Janisar village of Ferozepur, Iqbal Singh alias Kaka of Kalewala, Jatinder Pal Singh alias Lovely of Karaiwala and Gurjant Singh of Sohanewala village of Muktsar district.

The police authorities said that the terrorists were involved in a number of incidents of murder, dacoity, looting and extortion.

All accused were earlier held by the police in one case or the other since 1984 but once they were released from jail, they started extorting money from the people, by writing threatening letters on KCF pads.

The accused were arrested near Phulewala village on Thursday evening when they were riding two motorcycles without number plates, said Amrik Singh, superintendent of police Muktsar.

The police claimed to have recovered a hand-written letter from the accused which they purportedly wrote to a former panchayat member of Karaiwala village, demanding Rs 10 lakh. The police authorities said that Paramjit Singh had earlier sent a letter to his uncle to extort money.

Paramjit Singh and Jaskarn Singh were earlier arrested from Tuti Gandi Gurdwara of Muktsar in 1984 during Operation Bluestar. Jaskaran was involved in a murder case at Lakhewal village in Muktsar. Police said that during interrogation the accused confessed their involvement in number of crimes in the area.

8,Stay on arrest of Taj scam accused,"LUCKNOW: The High Court here on Friday stayed the arrest of former minister Naseemuddin Siddiqui, former principal secretary environment RK Sharma and former chairman-cum-managing director NPPCL, SC Bali till the conclusion of the investigation in the multi-crore Taj Heritage Corridor project scam unless the arrest was absolutely necessary.

9,CM trying to make party headless: SAD,"CHANDIGARH: The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) alleged here that Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh had plotted a political conspiracy to make the party headless by arresting former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal on the pretext of a corruption case close to the impending Lok Sabha elections.

Senior SAD leader and former finance minister Kanwaljit Singh ridiculed the red-alert notice issued by the vigilance bureau against Badal and his family members saying that it was â€˜â€˜cheap gimmickryâ€� that the chief minister was resorting to with a view to tarnishing the image of Badal.

He said the chief minister was fighting a political battle against Badal by cooking up a corruption case against him. The SAD, he said, would give a befitting reply to the government if any attempt was made to put Badal behind bars. He also condemned the VB for targeting Badalâ€™s wife, Surinder Kaur and his son, Sukhbir, in the case.

Taking exception to the red-alert notices reportedly sent by the VB at airports, Badal said the way in which Amarinder was creating sensational news was ridiculous as he only wanted to divert public attention from the dissidence within the Congress and the non-performance of the government.

He said instead of conducting a proper investigation, the chief minister was making a political game out of the corruption case. Badal said his movements were already in the notice of the state home department and the DGP, as being under Z category, there was no scope for him to move without informing the state.

He said if the chief minister was so anxious about his whereabouts he was prepared to make calls to him every morning to tell him about his daily schedule. Badal dared the chief minister to come and face him at any place of his choice.

He said he would be the last person to run away even as the VB had failed to collect any evidence against him.

The VB had been desperately trying to get all persons arrested by it to turn approvers, he said. It has also not been able to procure a single complaint of corruption against him.

Persons arrested by the VB were being subjected to third degree to extract statements against him (Badal), he added.

10,Wounds of '84 riots still fresh for them,"MOHALI: â€œI cannot put in words how I feel when I remember the days of terror we had spent locked in our house in Bhajanpura, Delhi, after Indira Gandhi was assassinated.

But when the entire nation mourns the death of the former prime minister, I remember my friends who were burnt alive on the roads with burning tyres around their necks just because they were Sikhs.

My blood boils when I think of those days,â€� said Preetam Singh, one of the victims of 1984 anti-Sikh riots that followed the assassination of Indira Gandhi. Preetam and his wife Kashmir Kaur are one of around 300 families living in the LIG houses in Phase XI, Mohali, that were allotted to them by the Akali government.

Most of these families are yet to recover from the shock of 1984 riots and have still not settled down even though 19 years have passed since the carnage. Other residents of the colony are not as vocal as Preetam and his wife.

Manjeet Kaur, whose husband was killed in the riots, lives here with her two daughters and sons. She got a job as a peon in Mandi Board, but still remembers her house in Gurgaon that was burnt by the rioters. Some were fortunate to get government jobs, but for others, who had left their everything, life has been a struggle. Many are earning a living doing petty jobs such as selling vegetables, clothes, selling soup and other eatables on the roadside.

â€œWe were promised jobs, shops and free houses by the government, but now we realise that it was all for our votes. For 19 years we have been used by the politicians. Even the houses that were allotted to us are not ours and we have been issued notices by the Puda to deposit the cost.

We feel cheated,â€� said Kashmir Kaur, one of the five women who had threatened self-immolation for the rights of the riot victims. â€œPeople tell us to forget our tragedy and start life anew, but we have seen so much carnage, suffered the loss of friends and family members at the hands of our own countrymen that it is impossible to forget it,â€� added Kashmir Kaur.

11,HC directs govt to check dengue,"LUCKNOW: The Lucknow Bench of the Allahabad High Court on Friday directed the state government to release funds, as an interim measure, for the purchase of 25 cycle-mounted and two big fogging machines for the city, which is reeling under a dengue onslaught.

The Bench, comprising Justice Pradeep Kant and Justice MA Khan, passed the aforesaid order on a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by a city lawyer Prashant Chandra.

The court ordered that the Lucknow Nagar Nigam (LNN) shall purchase the machines as soon as funds were made available, and if any demand has already been made by the LNN in addition to the aforesaid number of fogging machines, the same may also be considered by the government.

The order was passed in presence of principal secretary, medical & health services, Rakesh Mittal, SSP Rajiv Ranjan, director general, medical and health services Dr HP Kumar, municipal commissioner SP Singh, CMO Dr JP Yadav and the malaria officer.

Also, in view of the dengue fever, which requires blood platelets as part of the treatment, the Bench observed that it would be advisable for the state government to get component separators (platelet/blood separator kits) installed at least in one or two government hospitals in the city.

Also, at least one such kit should also be made available in government hospitals in every district in the state, the Bench ordered. Presently, only one kit is available at the SGPGIMS which is capable of supplying concentrated platelets.

The court observed that due to unhygienic condition in the city, there is a rise in the incidence of diseases like dengue fever, cholera, malaria, jaundice, etc. However, the district administration is unable to deal with the same for want of infrastructure, it added.

The court directed the chief medical officer and the urban malaria officer to take effective measures to get stagnating water disinfected at regular intervals all over the city. Also, a report shall be prepared of the work done every week and the quality of the medicine used, the court said adding that sufficient staff shall also be deputed for the purpose. The LNN and the malaria department were also directed to take measures apart from regular maintenance and cleaning of the city.

The court also discussed with the officials the licence to produce blood/platelets by private blood banks. It said that that the action on the application for licences would be taken expeditiously in accordance with the rules after due consideration and approval of the controller general of drugs of India.

The court clarified that directions are being given to issue licence to each and every nursing home or every applicant. It also observed that authorities concerned should issue licences to the genuine and bonafide persons according to rules.

The court fixed November 24 for further hearing and directed the authorities concerned to file compliance report and steps taken on that date. Municipal commissioner, drug controller, malaria officer and the CMO were directed to be present on the said date.

12,Volunteers slam state government,"PUNE: With the state government still short of 13,000 primary school teachers, 60,000 classrooms and with approximately 6,21,000 children between six and 14 years of age still deprived of schooling, the primary education scenario in Maharashtra seems dismal.

The state government therefore came in for brickbats at a two-day state-level seminar on primary education, which concluded here on Thursday. The seminar had been organised by â€˜Education Firstâ€™, a forum comprising non-governmental organisations (NGOs) engaged in education in the state.

The NGOs resolved to submit a memorandum of their demands to the state government shortly.

They include: government must give priority to primary education; Children between 6 and 14 years of age must be enrolled in mainstream schools;

Teachers must be accountable for quality of education; Government must bridge infrastructure gap urgently; All children out of mainstream schools must be designated as child labourers.

According to seminar convener Suryakant Kulkarni of Parbhani, the government had not attached enough importance to primary education. â€œGovernment reports suggest that 70 per cent of the students in class III and IV in government schools cannot read and write easily. Why is the government not taking any action,â€� he asked.

Kulkarni was also critical of the government for doing away with the balwadi (kindergarten) system. â€œBy stopping balwadis, students now go directly to class I and are not able to cope with the studies. This has resulted in a significant rise in dropouts,â€� Kulkarni said.

Vishwanath Todkar from the Aurangabad-based NGO Paryay expressed unhappiness over the governmentâ€™s alternative education systems like the Mahatma Phule Education Guarantee Scheme (MPEGS) and the vasti (hamlet) schools.

In MPEGS, a teacher is paid an honorarium of Rs 1,000 per month to teach child labourers in informal settings. â€œThis scheme is not a good idea because it does nothing to discourage child labour. As per the Constitution, free primary education is the right of every child. These alternatives only end up diluting the mainstream,â€� Todkar said.

Responding to the views of NGOs, Rajan Phansalkar, joint director of primary education, said there were as many as 63,000 students enrolled under the MPEGS. He expressed the hope that a majority of them would eventually be absorbed into the educational mainstream. â€œThe EGS is a central government initiative and has been created specifically to tackle the problem of child labour,â€� Phansalkar said.

Acknowledging the fact that the state was short of 60,000 classrooms, Phansalkar, said that the government is confident of bridging the gap by 2007 through the Sarva Shikhshan Abhiyan (SSA) funds.

About balwadis, Phansalkar said the state government had put a freeze on new balwadis because it felt they overlapped the existing system of anganwadis (day care centres). While the joint director acknowledged the huge shortfall in the number of teachers, he said the existing teachers were well-trained and took refresher courses regularly.

14,New York edge for govt schools,"NEW DELHI: They may not have travelled beyond the cityâ€™s limits, but for students of 11 Rajkiya Pratibha Vikas Vidyalayas it is time to say hello to the United States, courtesy Information Technology.

The State Council for Education Research and Training (SCERT) is all set to initiate student to student exchanges between Indian students and their American counterparts in New York, in the coming month. The project known as â€˜â€˜Culture Questâ€™â€™, is a type of online exchange programme aimed at initiating academic and cultural interaction.

The programme, funded by the New York-based American Indian Foundation, is a joint effort from the Centre for School Development, City College, New York, and SCERT. The pilot project of the programme was conducted in September last year, and the project is now ready to be implemented full steam in the 11 schools. â€˜â€˜We have been in touch with our American counterparts since last year and the pilot phase essentially involved interaction between teachers of both countries.

The focus will now be at facilitating direct student to student exchanges,â€™â€™ said SCERT director Janaki Rajan. Although plans seem to be well in place, officials admit that connectivity remains a major hurdle on the Indian side. â€˜â€˜We identified schools which had at least two computers to facilitate frequent interaction, but the Internet connection remains a problem as their speed is very slow.â€™â€™

â€œWe are hoping to get approval for dedicated lines which will offer instant connection at high speed,â€™â€™ said an official from the SCERT computer centre. The first phase of the programme involved training sessions for familiarising teachers with computers and the internet. A â€˜â€˜cultureâ€™â€™ workshop aimed at promoting better understanding of the culture and traditions of the two countries was also also conducted in January this year. The workshop was attended by Indian teachers as well as American academicians from City college New York.

15,"Badal conniving with Centre, says minister","LUDHIANA: Punjab minister for printing and stationary Rakesh Pandey, on Saturday, strongly criticised SAD chief Parkash Singh Badal for conniving with the NDA government to destabilise Congress government in the state to save himself from the corruption cases.

Addressing a function after inaugurating a set of three newly-developed Municipal Parks in ward number 4 at Salem Tabri here, Pandey asked Badal to refrain from misleading people by twisting the issues of rampant corruption against him as political vendetta. The minister accused Badal of making a mockery of democracy by stressing upon the NDA government to destabilise the democratically elected Congress government in Punjab.

He asserted that the Congress government would honourably complete its full term of five years and was committed to bring the state to the number one position in the field of development in the country. Strongly reacting to rumours of factionalism within the Congress party, he said that the whole party was solidly behind chief minister Amarinder Singh.

Referring to the achievements of Ludhiana Municipal Corporation, Pandey said the financial condition of the corporation has been substantially improved and now the corporation was in surplus of Rs 12 crore after clearing the loss of Rs 11 crore within a period of one year. He claimed that the corporation has executed 42 new tubewells with a short span of one year. Municipal Corporation mayor Nahar Singh Gill said that Ludhiana city had achieved a distinction by providing drinking water to 100 per cent of the population. He said the work on repair of all the roads in the city have been started and all the parks in the city would be properly developed and maintained.
