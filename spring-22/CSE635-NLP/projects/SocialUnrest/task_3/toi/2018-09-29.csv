0,Govt may bend laws to prevent broken homes from shrinking,"ahmedabad: dhiren bhatt and his eight neighbours in the now-collapsed parth apartment in gulbai tekra had three-bedroom flats, each measuring 133 square yard. when parth residents presented their reconstruction plans they were told that the legally the plan would have to be restricted to 55 square yard flats. the residents of parth are among the scores of residents of buildings that collapsed in the january 26 earthquake who are now finding that reconstruction would mean living in much smaller homes. the collapsed buildings had illegal extensions which are not being allowed under the new stricter rules imposed after the earthquake. think-tank of the ahmedabad municipal corporation is hard at work these days. the corporation's administrators are going through the grind trying to stop broken city homes from shrinking in the post-quake reconstruction scenario. no less than 69 complaints are with the amc that speak of irregularities practised by builders and developers. in some cases the fsi has been increased or that extra storey has come up on a low-rise or a pent-house added to a 10-storeyed high-rise. while in others the cantilever portion of a building has been extended illegally for more space without column or beam support and without amc's permission. though the civic body's recommendations, which have been called for by the state government to resolve these cases, will differ on a case-to-case basis, the civic authorities have decided to suggest that minor illegalities be allowed to remain when broken homes are reconstructed. till thursday, corporation authorities were busy holding discussions with individual house owners and discussing the pros and cons on reconstruction of their broken homes keeping the stringent general development control regulations (gdcr) in mind. ""we spoke to the builder-developer community at the outset but dialogues with owners are proving to be fruitful as the latter is prepared to adjust. and, the corporation too is ready to take that extra step towards a humane reconciliation. since other building illegalities are being regularised through levy of impact fee, it is only just that a suitable solution be there for those whose homes were destroyed by the earthquake,"" said a senior official in amc. so, that extra elbow room that you had in your dream home may still be there when the new house comes up but fate of that penthouse or that illegal storey or commercial establishments in place of parking lots may be doomed. residents of shitalbaug apartment in paldi, which collapsed killing seven residents, had to actually buy out some residents to get more space. the flat was built at a time when fsi ceiling was 1.1 but the builder somehow managed an fsi of 2. sanctioned for 96 square metres, on completion the building covered 120 square metres. shitalbaug had 16 flats but the new gdcr allows only 11. ""so we paid back rs 5.25 lakh to each of the remaining five families. now we are faced with reconstruction cost of rs 4,500 per square yard,"" lamented a shitalbaug resident. the state minister for urban development, parmanand khattar told tnn that section 29 (2) of the town planning act empowers the state government to set aside certain rules of the gdcr in special circumstances. of the 69 collapsed-building cases in ahmedabad, studies and recommendations on 46 have reached the urban development department from the municipal commissioner's office. violations of building bylaws and deviations in fsi and original plans are being considered. ""a suitable, humane solution to this impasse will soon be evolved so that reconstruction of the crumbled multi-storeys, with as little changes to its original structure as possible, can start,"" the minister said.

4,Man-beast conflicts rise with increasing encroachments,"bangalore: spotting a deer in one's backyard in the early morning haze on monday at attibele may have brightened the city's humdrum life. but chasing the leopard out of the school premises in mysore on friday last week, has run a shiver down many a spine and if wildlife experts are to be believed, number of leopards straying into urban habitats is on the rise. the reasons cited for such cases over the last five years are attributed to these wild cats being lured by the scent of cattle in the forests close to villages. this may be the case for most carnivores since cattle is the easiest available prey near the forest. animal experts say leopards, deer and many invertebrates are mostly those living on the fringes of the forests. ""it's no wonder then, that these animals frequent human habitats, besides chasing smaller animals like deer into human our habitation."" regular fragmentation of forests by way of making pathways by humans, has led to the habitat loss of invertebrates; arboreal animals like the monkeys, gibbons and lion-tailed macaques are losing their habitat due to high-tension wires; forest degradation due to mining has an impact on elephant habitat, the the experts. ""if quarrying is not stopped in the bannerghatta area, wild elephants may soon stray into bangalore city,"" said vidyasagar, director of bannerghatta national park, noting the leopard rescued in mysore recently will be shifted to the park. however, wildlife veterinarian anand ramanathan of the wildlife trust of india felt the heavy rains that lashed the city recently may have driven the spotted deer and the leopard into the city. ""these animals may have come in search of better habitat and may have accidentally hit city areas,"" he said. a python was reportedly found in the city last week. a tiger was beaten to death by villagers in tarikere of shimoga district in april this year. five pangolins were reported to have strayed into the surrounding villages in the last two months. three leopards have been straying time and again into the arohalli village for the last six months. unlike bigger animals, smaller animals like jackals, mangoose and rabbit can camouflage themselves and escape the human eye. the fact remains these animals dwell in human habitats and have adapted well to urban lifestyles. they are only becoming more visible,"" say animal experts. officials in the forest department speak of scores of incidents of conflicts between man and beast in the last few years. but the question as to who is encroaching whose territory remains unanswered.

""this is baiting of panchayats and calling its representatives to a glorified state party at the expense of public money,"" the bench added. the bench held that ""education cannot come to a halt for political rallies and political conventions. the act is not only arbitrary but crude and lacking sensibility"". the court maintained that ""let no one in power take so much credit by advertising the newly formed local-self government"". the judgment was delivered on a writ petition of the association of independent schools challenging the government order for requisitioning the private school buildings from september 29 to october 3. the state's plea was that about two lakh panchayat members had to be accommodated during the convention and it had no alternative but to requisition the private school buildings as well. the court quashed the requisition order of patna district magistrate and the secretary, secondary education. the bench held that the requisition was illegal and unconstitutional ""affecting some fundamental rights of the students, the teachers and the owners of the schools"". the court held valid the plea of the petitioners that the order was tantamount to ""criminal trespass and lurking house trespass"". this verdict will have far reaching consequences as the bench held in clear terms that ""the action to requisition schools for accommodation and closure of educational institutions as a consequence has no sanction of law"". the court noted with serious concern that even the university examinations for different faculties had been postponed due to the convention. the bench held that ""the panchayat as an institution was not subordinate to state government. any orientation to panchayats need be taken within the districts where they operate."" in the present case ""the state has beckoned the panchayats to its fold. with this the very essence of the local self government in rural areas is affected"".

18,Haryana frames policy for mines,"chandigarh:in a major decision, the haryana cabinet, on friday, decided that a policy be framed for grant of mining leases of minor minerals by public auction. the decision has been taken on the basis of the recommendations made by the task force constituted under the chairmanship of managing director of haryana minerals, on june 29 this year, and a committee headed by the chief secretary, which had considered the recommendations of the task force. it was suggested that leases of all unallotted, prematurely terminated, expired or likely to expire areas in faridabad and gurgaon districts, and the potential areas of rewari and mahendergarh districts be granted by open auction for minor minerals only. it was also decided to keep the duration of the lease to a period of seven years. it was felt that the open auction system would be more transparent as compared to the existing system of inviting applications and holding interviews for mining.this system would also check leakage of revenue as there would be a minimum guaranteed income in the form of annual dead rent, determined on the basis of auction. the committee recommended that the mining leases for minor minerals should be subject to the condition that major minerals extracted incidentally be stacked separately to be disposed of by the haryana mines and geology department. such major minerals will be the property of the state.

21,Haryana frames policy for mines,"chandigarh:in a major decision, the haryana cabinet, on friday, decided that a policy be framed for grant of mining leases of minor minerals by public auction. the decision has been taken on the basis of the recommendations made by the task force constituted under the chairmanship of managing director of haryana minerals, on june 29 this year, and a committee headed by the chief secretary, which had considered the recommendations of the task force. it was suggested that leases of all unallotted, prematurely terminated, expired or likely to expire areas in faridabad and gurgaon districts, and the potential areas of rewari and mahendergarh districts be granted by open auction for minor minerals only. it was also decided to keep the duration of the lease to a period of seven years. it was felt that the open auction system would be more transparent as compared to the existing system of inviting applications and holding interviews for mining.this system would also check leakage of revenue as there would be a minimum guaranteed income in the form of annual dead rent, determined on the basis of auction. the committee recommended that the mining leases for minor minerals should be subject to the condition that major minerals extracted incidentally be stacked separately to be disposed of by the haryana mines and geology department. such major minerals will be the property of the state.

25,"Medicines stolen from Tata hospital, four arrested","mumbai: the bhoiwada police recently arrested four persons, including a wardboy of tata memorial hospital in parel, in connection with the theft of medicines worth over rs 1.62 lakhs from the hospital's dispensary in the past six months. those arrested are chandrakant ghag, the wardboy, rakesh shetty, ramesh shetty and ravindra shetty, owners of ishwar medical store situated behind the hospital. the shettys have been accused of purchasing the stolen medicines from the wardboy. they are currently out on bail while ghag is in judicial custody. investigating officer vijay waghmare said: ``ghag had forged medical prescription slips and registration cards of three patients in the hospital. he used the fake prescriptions to obtain expensive medicines from the hospital's dispensary.'' incidentally, the cost of the medicines was billed to the three patients on whose names the fake prescriptions were prepared. ghag's modus operandi was to approach relatives of other patients and request them to get the medicines for him from the dispensary. ``it is surprising why the relatives obliged and even stood in a queue to get medicines for him. we do not know how ghag managed to trick these relatives,'' another officer said. when one such relative approached the dispensary for medicines on september 15, the compounder suspected foul play. he alerted the vigilance wing of the hospital, which tracked down ghag and handed him over to the police. the hospital, in their complaint, has alleged that medicines worth rs 1.62 lakh have been stolen in the past six months. but the police have not been able to recover the stolen medicines. it is learnt that the police had arrested the three chemist shop owners on suspicion. ``ghag had confessed that he sold the medicines to the shop,'' an officer said. the shop owners were remanded to police custody for four days. but due to lack of evidence, the court released them on bail. the police now suspect the role of other staff members at the hospital in the racket. ``ghag was being assisted by a few other staff members, who are likely to be arrested soon,'' a senior officer stated. the police also suspect the role of some of the patients and their relatives in the racket. ``we suspect that these patients received undue favours from ghag for getting medicines for him from the dispensary,'' an officer, who did not wish to be named, said.

26,Indicted academician continues to head varsity law department,"mumbai: mumbai university's law department now has an unusual claim to fame it is currently being headed by a person indicted by the varsity's unfair means inquiry committee for examination malpractice. barely two months back, the committee had held law faculty dean and head p.c. warke guilty of helping a student pass the ll.m. (masters in law) exam. following the report, mr warke resigned as dean, but continues as the varsity's law department head__much to the consternation of many university observers. ``it reflects badly on the university if one of its departments is headed by a person who has been found guilty of examination malpractice,'' points out a faculty member, adding that the head should take moral responsibility for his actions and step down. the inquiry itself was initiated early this year after certain documents were found in a student's answer-sheet assessed by mr warke. the documents included a xerox copy of the answer-sheet, with a hand-written note saying that the student needed 15 more marks to pass the exam. mr warke, who has consistently denied having indulged in any malpractice, had given the student exactly 15 more marks. in its report, the committee noted that mr warke had given the student more marks than she deserved and recommended keeping him away from all examination work. mumbai university has decided to stick to only those recommendations. although many faculty members are crying foul about the fact that a `tainted' academician is acting as head, university officials seem quite content with the fact that mr warke has resigned as dean. ``by resigning as dean, mr warke will be excluded from all examination work,'' vice-chancellor b.l. mungekar told this newspaper. he further stated that the board of examinations (boe) unanimously felt that it was enough if mr warke resigned from his deanship. ``initially, it was felt that he should be removed from both posts, but the boe reconsidered its decision at a subsequent meeting,'' the vice-chancellor said. besides, the unfair means report only recommended keeping mr warke away from exam work, he said. academicians, however, are not too convinced. ``by letting him continue as head, we are just destroying the credibility of the examination system itself,'' says a department head. as head, mr warke would be ex-officio member of various university bodies and be in a position to influence many decisions, he adds. moreover, many university observers are piqued by the fact that varsity fficials seem to be following different set of rules for teaching staff and non-teaching staff. ``if it is a malpractice involving a non-teaching staff member, he or she is immediately suspended. in this case, they have allowed a person holding an important post continue after his indictment,'' says a faculty member. observers also state that university statutes clearly specify a code of conduct for teachers, which among other things state that `a teacher shall not indulge in or resort to any malpractice in teaching or examination...' varsity sources further say that the boe recently framed guidelines for college officials, stating that persons indicted for examination malpractice should not be allowed to hold any high positions. ``if this is what we are telling colleges, then how can university departments not follow it, that too merely on a technicality,'' says a department head.

27,Buddhadeb for rally clampdown,"kolkata: chief minister buddhadeb bhattacharjee wants to keep the city roads free of processions and political rallies on working days. he is ready to call an all-party meeting on the issue, on october 1, but will he be able to rein in the left front cadres? even as bhattacharjee decided to clamp down on political rallies, central kolkata remained clogged throughout friday afternoon, thanks to a two-day long procession by the left front against globalisation and free market. commuters along rani rashmoni road, one of the main thoroughfares, were badly stranded. cpm state secretary anil biswas, however, said that rallyists converging at esplanade were instructed to keep one side of the road free for traffic. strangely, the chief minister's attempts to free the city of rally hazards, evoked sharp reaction from opposition parties. the trinamul congress is in no mood to relent, especially after its talks with the chief minister on the tolly nullah issue broke down. trinamul leaders point out that as responsible opposition, the party was willing to cooperate with the state government on civic issues. ""the chief minister is taking the right step by convening the all-party meet. but after our last meeting, there is no atmosphere to sit across the table with him,"" said trinamul mla partha chatterjee. the congress camp, however, remained non-committal. the congress made it clear that it will attend the all-party meeting if invited. ""we will listen to what the chief minister has to say on this matter. only then, will we spell out our stand on this issue,"" said pcc leader manas bhuniya. the state bjp said that they are yet to receive an invitation for the meeting. reacting to the move, bjp vice-president muzaffar khan said that the move initiated by the chief minister was mere posturing. ""they are the ones who are blocking the road and causing hardships to people,"" khan said. the bjp camp, however, is not certain how far the cpm will let chief minister buddhadeb bhattacharjee to go ahead with his plans.

28,Medical men attack govt policy,"kolkata: they tried to take the bull by its horns. indian medical association and medical services centre, two premier medical organisations in the state, launched a scathing attack on the new health policy of the west bengal government. medical professionals from all over the state on friday sharply criticised the government's decision on private participation in state hospitals. in a well-attended seminar in the calcutta medical college auditorium, members of these organisations condemned the government's decision to lease out space inside all the government hospitals to private agencies. ""this will escalate the cost of treatment, defeating the aim of the state health policy"" said dr subhash chakraborty, retired professor, calcutta medical college. senior medical professionals from all over the state joined the campaign, including ima vice-president dr atanu bhattacharya, dr asim roychowdhury, former principal, medical college, dr shyamaprasad dutta, dr subhash chakraborty, dr bishnu mukherjee, dr bijgyan bera, dr biswanath paria along with educationists like sunanda sanyal. ""the whole system is suffering from a lack of vision and focus,"" said chakraborty. ""the draft national health policy admits the flaws in the system. but here we seem to have shifted our paradigm completely."" ima (kolkata chapter) secretary r.d. dubey said, ""this will increase the cost of treatment and the rural population who come to the city for treatment will be the worst hit. we at ima think that this move will harm the cause of the poor people of the state"" he said. ""the minimum cost for a ct scan will be rs 800, which is higher than that offered by some of the private health care providers,"" said bishnu mukherjee, vice-president, medical services centre, state chapter. ""growing corruption and vested interests have gone beyond redemption and it is evident in all the moves the government is making,"" he said. ""this privatisation is only a way of fulfilling evil motives. land is being handed over to private parties at throwaway prices, government is providing counter-guarantee to agencies which are supposed to open medicine shops and polyclinics inside the hospitals,"" he said. a committee to secure the patient's rights was formed by the medical services centre, with dr tarun mondol as secretary and dr bishnu mukherjee as president. ""we will continue with our movement against such unethical practice,"" mukherjee said.

29,CM eases SIMI rhetoric but arrests go on,"kolkata: the west bengal government has decided to tone down its anti-simi rhetoric a day after the radical muslim outfit was banned by the centre. chief minister buddhadeb bhattacharjee clarified on friday that his government had not sought a ban on the students islamic movement of india (simi). ""no such appeal was sent by us,"" he said. union home minister l.k. advani had claimed on thursday that the ban was imposed after appeals from several state governments. in bihar, too, the rabri devi government was going slow on the arrests of simi activist. rjd chief laloo prasad yadav in fact criticised the centre for singling out the simi for a ban. political observers, however, said the rjd was reluctant to disturb the carefully cultivated muslim-yadav equation in the state. in new delhi, the opposition while not unequivocally opposing the move, did not welcome it either. instead, they clamoured for a similar ban on the bajrang dal and other sangh outfits. however, after a high-level meeting chaired by advani during the day, the home ministry justified the ban saying there was sufficient evidence to link simi with osama bin laden's al qaida and other pan-islamic organisations. meanwhile, crackdown on simi offices and office-bearers continued across the country. more than 250 activists of the outfit, including its all-india president shahid badr salhi, were taken into custody. curfew continued for the second day in four areas of lucknow, where four people were killed in police firing after thursday's violence. uttar pradesh chief minister rajnath singh on friday ordered a probe into the violence in the old city area but no time frame was fixed for the inquiry. the state government also sent a report on the incident to the union home ministry. while 86 simi activists were taken into custody, no untoward incident was reported from anywhere in the state on friday. in west bengal, 30 activists of the outfit were arrested from five districts. eight leaders were arrested each from north 24 parganas, malda and south dinajpur along with four from murshidabad and two from asansol town. the outfit's offices in asansol and murshidabad were sealed and posters and pamphlets supporting osama bin laden were seized from these offices, dig (headquarters) narayan ghosh said. the eight simi activist arrested from kolkata on thursday were produced in the court of the metropolitan magistrate on friday. they were remanded to police custody for 14 days. according to dc (sb) gourav dutt, the arrested students were charged under unlawful activities act 1967 as well section 153 and 120b of ipc for breaching communal harmony and conspiracy. those arrested include simi state secretary akramul haque, member of state committee and the head of the organisation's south 24 parganas unit shamsul haque. while they were picked up from simi's lenin sarani office, the khiddirpore branch president, ali ahmed, was arrested from ekbalpore.

34,Do or die: Inside the mind of a suicide attacker,"mumbai: the origins of moral dilemma can be traced to that fateful moment when the serpent tempted eve in eden with the fruit of knowledge. eve fell for the bait (or was it bite?), which ultimately led to the fall from paradise. should she have chosen otherwise? moral philosophers say such questions can be asked only in hindsight, with the benefit of knowledge and discrimination that are the hallmarks of humanity. this means that without first arming herself with reason and knowledge, eve could not have made a 'rational' choice. but it would also be wrong to assume that moral judgments are based on reasoning alone. intuition and emotions play a big part. and intuition, in turn, is governed by cultural conditioning about what is 'right' and 'wrong'. this explains why we have situations where one person's 'martyrdom' may equal another's assassination. in this context, the french psychoanalyst jacques lacan goes so far as to argue that there is no such thing as absolute good or absolute meaning that animates or 'authorises' our actions. ""all our actions,"" he says, ""including language itself have no value beyond its own terms of reference."" in all likelihood, therefore, say experts, the attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon on september 11 were ""the work of perfectly sane people"". although such attacks have been termed suicide bombings, these experts add, the bombers themselves are not suicidal in any commonsensical use of the term. ""the conventional psychiatric understanding of what goes on in individual suicides simply doesn't help us understand this,"" dr jerrold post, a professor of political psychology and international affairs at george washington university told the new york times. ""you have to look at this as a social phenomenon. ""the koran forbids suicide,"" he added. ""but the so-called suicide bombers often consider their deaths as acts of heroism, not self-destruction, and they believe they will be elaborately rewarded in the afterlife."" studies carried out on prisoners in northern ireland also suggest that people who launch suicide attacks are fanatical but not suicidal in the usual sense. ""they certainly are not psychotic or suicidal in that sense,"" explains dr john bradford, director of forensic psychiatry at the royal ottawa hospital and author of the study. ""but they are people who are essentially fighting a war..people get to a point they absolutely believe in it (their cause),"" he continues. ""they're not going to waver. what's interesting is how they compartmentalise their belief system, which allows them to justify anything in the name of it."" indoctrination plays a significant part in the creation of such a mind-set. ""it's obviously difficult for anyone to take their own life,"" dr bradford says. ""but in the case of a person who believes martyrdom will bring immortality, all that changes."" group dynamics play a crucial role in the indoctrination process. ""the bomber thrives during indoctrination by a tight-knit group,"" says psychiatrist larry litman of the university of western ontario. ""there's a group dynamic (at work) here. they're part of a group where this kind of otherwise reprehensible behaviour is considered normal and even praiseworthy. so, if they're surrounded by other suicide bombers (and their handlers), they're not going to think there's anything abnormal about this,"" he adds. ""it looks bizarre only to us who are outside the explosive circle of hate."" the people indulging in such politically motivated acts of self-destruction do not see themselves as snuffing out their life prematurely. rather, they see themselves as laying down their life for the greater good of their cohorts or band. in that sense, experts say, suicide-bombers are no different from freedom-fighters or members of any elite fighting group, trained to subordinate their own welfare to the so-called common good. the world trade center bombers have also been likened to japanese kamikaze pilots who underwent an almost hypnotic mental transformation during training that enabled them to sacrifice themselves for what they believed was immortal honour. cultural conditioning, which glorified self-inflicted death (seppuku or hara-kiri), played a key role in the indoctrination process. closer home, this may also explain the 'do-or-die' spirit of certain 'martial' communities like pathans, rajputs and jats which have fierce family or clan loyalties, often guarded at the cost of an individual's life.

37,UP farmers wedded to primitive methods,"lucknow: small and marginal farmers of utta pradesh continue to be in a pitiable condition despite their significant contribution to state's agriculture production that has shown a 10 per cent increase during the last one decade. such is the financial status of nearly three-fourth of them that they are left with no option but to fall back on traditional mode of farming -- using bullocks for ploughing the fields with a primitive hoe. as a result, the mechanisation of agriculture has progressed at a snail's pace in the state. the prevailing situation also does not seem to be set for a change immediately, as there are few takers to the government schemes proposed for this purpose. official figures put the total number of tractors in teh state at 4,51,381, which has remained almost static during the last four years. although the government has launched a scheme for mechanisation of agriculture and proposed to provide a subsidy of 30 per cent, still there are few takers to this. reasons are not far to seek. while a majority of farmers still don't know about the scheme, the cumbersome process for the selection of beneficiaries is yet another deterrent. a large number of complaints revealed that in majority of cases, the beneficiaries got only a part of the total subsidy. the better part of it went to officials engaged in the process. as nankau of sitapur puts it: ""i got only rs 20,000, the remaining rs 10,000 was taken away by the officials"". similarly, a provision has been made under the state-sponsored schemes to provide 15 per cent subsidy -- up to maximum rs 15,000 and rs 3,500 -- for purchasing power-tiller, driller and a variety of other equipment. the government has also proposed to spend a sum of rs 72.01 lakh to provide 200 power tillers. but the targets are hardly met with and the sums sanctioned lapses for want of beneficiaries. further, the electricity consumption by farmers in the state is about 38.32 per cent as compared to 50.19 per cent in haryana, 43.27 per cent in karnataka, 43.61 per cent in punjab and andhra pradesh and 15.15 per cent in bihar. what is thus needed is to lay thrust on a more scientific management of agriculture to improve the conditions of the farming community, feel agricultural scientists. another important shift needed in the government policy is that at least one village should be adopted in each district to undertake the pilot project of popularising the agriculture mechanisation and under this all necessary technological inputs should be given to farmers in order to educate them in better methods of farming. the mechanisation will not only increase the per hector yield, but also reduce the capital cost on agriculture.
