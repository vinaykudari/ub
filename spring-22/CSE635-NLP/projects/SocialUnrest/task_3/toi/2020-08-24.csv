0,It’s TV time for farmers in state,"HYDERABAD: A programme to reach farmers through the electronic media has been conceived by the state government, an experiment reminiscent of the Centreâ€™s Krishi Darshan efforts in the 1980â€™s.

Doordarshan has a role in this scheme too, with its Sapthagiri channel, along with a private Telugu, chosen as the vehicle for airing cropwise demonstration programmes.

A major difference in this time around is that chief minister Chandrababu Naidu has told agricultural extension officers to make sure that a group of farmers sit before the community TV each day for learning the best agricultural practices.

The demonstration lecture would be on one crop a day and only those farmers who are connected with that crop will be brought to watch the programme. The programme will be telecast in the evening so that farm operations are not affected. The lessons should not be theoretical, Naidu has ordered.

The experts would give farmers information about rainfall conditions and moisture levels as on that day, beside details of crop diseases and precautions.

Agriculture department officials have been told to utilise the Mee Kosam programme recently launched on Doordrashanâ€™s Sapthagiri channel and extend its telecast time to four hours from Monday. Officials have also been told to speed up supply of cell phones to the extension officers. Though the government had decided to give cell phones to these officers some time back, it was hanging fire due to BSNLâ€™s procedural delays.

Meanwhile, the once popular Krishi Darshan, looks like making a major comeback after being discontinued on Doordrashan a few years ago.

1,Excise policy to be revised,"HYDERABAD: Stung by the liquor deaths, the state government is contemplating changes in the excise policy. An expert panel will be constituted to suggest changes and plug the shortcomings in the present excise policy.

The new policy will tie up the loose ends in the existing excise rules. The revamped policy will come into force from the next excise year commencing from October 1.

Talking to The Times of India, excise and prohibition minister T Seetaram said that the committee would look into all the issues that needed to be addressed in the wake of the recent liquor deaths in the state. The minister said that â€œenforcement of excise rules has slackened in the recent past due to confusing signals emanating from senior levels.â€�

The panel will examine issues like presence of liquor syndicates, trade rivalries and promotion of certain brands. In fact changes in the existing excise policy were contemplated some time ago, but the government apparently did not go further for reasons unknown.

With the government wanting to boost the revenue from the liquor sales, senior officers are fixing targets for the subordinate staff and forcing them to sell more liquor to step up revenue. When prohibition was in force, the government was not even in a position to pay salaries to its employees.

2,Mumbai PI arrested in stamp scam,"PUNE: Senior police inspector Dattatraya Dal of Mumbai crime branch has become the 50th person to be arrested in the fake stamp paper scam. Dal, who was arrested by the special investigation team (SIT) in Mumbai on Thursday, was produced before judicial magistrate first class M.N. Bondre here on Friday and was remanded to police custody till September 1.

Special prosecutor Raja Thakre said Dal, who was posted at the Dharavi police station, was accused of protecting scam kingpin Abdul Telgi during investigations, fabricating crucial crime branch records and not co-operating with the SIT.

Thakre said Dal was arrested after his role in the scam became clear during interrogation of Telgi''s lawyer, Rashid Kulkarni.

Meanwhile, the magisterial custody of Kulkarni was extended by Bondre up to September 5. The extension preceded some courtroom drama with Kulkarni making a plea for transfer to a Bangalore jail on humanitarian grounds.

He pleaded for leniency, saying his wife was suffering from asthma and his daughter was pregnant.

3,No aid to AIDS patients in govt hospitals,"LUCKNOW: Pregnancy is becoming a curse for Reshma Z, an HIV positive from Jhansi, as doctors in a local womanâ€™s hospital have refused to take up her case. A desperate Reshma, along with her husband, made several trips to the hospitals only to be turned down for being a high risk category.

â€œThe woman is now mother of a bony girl delivered in Jhansi but at a private nursing home,â€™â€™ informs Sapan Barua, male counsellor in the Voluntary Counselling and Testing Centre (VCTC) of the Chhatrapati Shahuji Maharaj Medical University (CSMMU). Out of the 2500 odd counselling cases at the centre, stretching over the last three years, â€œphysicians biasâ€� is emerging as a major problem in AIDS management in UP, Barua said.

Call it a mental block or overcautious approach, government doctors in the state are in the grip of AIDS phobia. Not a single district hospital has ever tried nursing AIDS patients so far, confide health department sources. Bearing testimony to the charge were 12 AIDS patients thronging the AIDS clinic on Saturday from Siddharthnagar, Gorakhpur, Basti ,Faizabad, Sultanpur and Ambedkar Nagar. Records showed that none of them received any treatment at the district hospitals.

Professor of medicine and nodal officer for AIDS in CSMMU, Dr AK Tripathi, a pioneer in AIDS management in the state, frankly admits that during â€œthe last eleven years, he has not received even one inquiry from any district hospital about management of AIDS patient although there have been calls for help from private practitioners from Allahabad, Kanpur, Meerut and Gorakhpur.â€�

â€œModus operandi in government hospitals is either to ignore the patients completely or to tell them that they had little chance of recovery unless they went for further treatment to Lucknow,â€� confided another senior faculty member. This attitude is proving a stumbling block as patients have no local health infrastructural support to manage AIDS-related complications once they get back home, he added.

Significantly, none of the 54 district hospitals allocated Rs 25,000 for treating HIV patients by the UP State AIDS Control Board nearly a year ago, have used the money.The Post Exposure Prophylexis Kits (PEP) supplied to them for accidental exposure to the virus also remain untouched, claimed government sources.

The worst sufferers are pregnant women, fear gynaecologists. With number of HIV women patients on the rise ,UP will soon have a major problem of tackling this segment. The HIV positive women also pose a grave health hazard if they opt for childbirth at home with the help of local daies(midwives). The government, they point out, will have to adopt harsh measures to make doctors attend such patients.

4,CBI quizzes minister: THC,"LUCKNOW: The Central Bureau of Investigations (CBI) team probing the Taj Heritage Corridor (THC) irregularities grilled transport and excise minister Naseemuddin Siddiqui in the state capital for more than four hours on Sunday.

Despite a weekly off, the CBI sleuths held a marathon session ending late tonight. The minister has been directed not to leave the city without intimating the CBI. He is also to make himself available to the investigators as and when required.

Sources said that the CBI team headed by an SP rank officer threw a ring around Naseemuddin Siddiqui who was at the Ambedkar Rally Sthal along with Mayawati a little after noon. When the CM was busy briefing officials about last minute arrangements for the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) Karyakarta Sammelan slated for Monday, Naseemuddin was briefed about the waiting CBI team by the SP heading the investigators. Minutes after Mayawati left the site, Naseemuddin was escorted to a waiting car and the team left for an undisclosed destination.

It was not before 7:30 pm that Naseemuddin reached his government accommodation after what his supporters at his house described as â€œan important meetingâ€�. The minister remained elusive to the mediamen and efforts to contact him for his comments proved futile.

However, sources said that the CBI grilled Nasseemuddin at length over the grounds on which Rs 17.5 crore were ordered to be released for the THC despite the absence of the detailed project report (DPR) on the plan. Though the money was sanctioned by a competent authority of the Pollution Control Board, the investigators believe that Nasseemuddin, who was then the minister for enviorment as well, ensured that the sanction was allowed. The CBI team was categorical of how the money was released to National Project Construction Committee (NPCC) - the agency executing the construction work at site despite a few mandatory formalities being left unattended to, sources said. Questions on the influence of political leaders on the decisions of Nasseemuddin were also put to the minister said to be a trusted lieutenant of Mayawati.

The CBI team is likely to quiz some top bureaucrats involved in the THC project on Monday. Some other eminent personalities of the state, who have been identified as very important persons by the Supreme Court where however expected to be grilled in Delhi in the first week of September.

The demonstration was organised by the Forbesganj Bhangi Sangharsh Samiti and supported by different organisations. An effigy of the executive engineer of BSEB was also burnt by the activists.

The agitationists released both the officials in the evening, only after they talked twice over telephone with B P Sinha, the technical secretary to the BSEB chairman, who assured that the general manager, BSEB, Saharsa, has been directed to immediately sort out the technical snags in the transmission line between Purnia and Forbesganj.

Sinha said that all steps would be taken to minimise the frequent breakdowns in the transmission line and assured that 10 per cent extra power supply would be provided to Forbesganj in future.

The agitationists released the BSEB official and the clerk giving them one week time for the overall improvement in the power supply and its maintenance.

7,"Catch them young, govt tells Army","NEW DELHI: Faced with ''''greying'''' officers at the cutting-edge level of battalion and brigade commanders, the defence ministry is likely to soon implement drastic measures to restructure the armed forces into lean, mean fighting machines.

The ministry is now ''''actively'''' considering the recommendations made by two high-powered committees. One committee, headed by Ajai Vikram Singh, examined the restructuring of officers'' cadre, while the other has recommended making the Short Service Commission ''''more attractive and lucrative''''.

The primary objectives are to arrest the ''''aging profile'''', avoid stagnation at different ranks, and make the armed forces more alluring for youngsters. The measures will be implemented gradually over the next 5-7 years, with mid-term corrections, say sources.

The Singh committee has recommended a viable exit policy at middle to senior ranks, which includes an ''''attractive'''' monetary package and help in locating an alternative career, on one hand, and upgradation of ranks, on the other.

Some drastic measures are indeed required. The average age of an Indian Army colonel who leads a battalion into war is 42. In sharp contrast, the age of battalion commanders of the Pakistani, Chinese, Israeli and other armies is 35-37 years.

An ''''older'''' commander is reluctant to take risks, which can often turn victory into defeat. Moreover, he is less fit for battlefields at high altitudes and glaciated terrains which the Indian Army has to contend with.

10,Iranian foreign minister holds talks with Sinha,"NEW DELHI: The emerging situation in Iraq, other regional issues and ways to bolster bilateral cooperation were discussed at a meeting between visiting Iranian foreign minister Kamal Kharrazi and External Affairs Minister Yashwant Sinha on Sunday.

Kharrazi, heading a high-level economic delegation, also called on Prime Minister Vajpayee soon after arriving in New Delhi on Sunday evening.

Iran''s long-pending proposal for a gas pipeline to India via Pakistan was also understood to have figured in the talks between the two delegations. Iran is also keen to enlist India''s support in reducing its increasing isolation over its nuclear programme.

Bottlenecks continue to persist on the Iranian proposal for an overland gas pipeline through Pakistan, with India saying that Teheran and New Delhi will have to work out ``mutually acceptable, secure and stable arrangements for transfer of gas''''.

Kharrazi had accompanied Iranian President Seyyed Mohammad Khatami on his visit to India in January. The two countries had then signed seven accords, including a landmark New Delhi declaration, in which they had agreed that the global fight against terrorism should not be based on ""double standards"".

11,Police get clean chit in SBS colony clash,"CHANDIGARH: Eyewitnesses have given a clean chit to the UT police and enforcement wing officials connected with the outbreak of violence at the SBS colony in June when an angry mob of over 1,500 slum dwellers clashed with the police and enforcement staff who were fencing off public land cleared of encroachments.

In their joint testimony, recorded before UT deputy commissioner-cum-district magistrate Arun Kumar, over 30 eyewitnesses from the colony have blamed their own brethren for inciting the mob fury that left additional deputy commissioner I S Sandhu, DSP SS Randhawa, two BJP leaders and more than 30 policemen injured.

The eyewitnesses have testified that the new settlers, who had retuned to the colony after it was demolished in the year 2001, were responsible for fanning the violent behaviour of the slum dwellers to scatter whom the police lobbed tear gas shells and fired some shots in the air.

The witnesses have also absolved BJP leaders Sat Pal Jain and Yash Mahajan who were earlier being accused of instigating the mob to take on the police and enforcement wing staff.

UT administrator O P Verma had directed the DC to conduct an inquiry into the incident and put together the sequence of events that led to the showdown between the slum dwellers and policemen.

Now that the witnesses have got their statements recorded, the district magistrate will take the inquiry further by recording the versions of the police officials on duty that day, the enforcement staff and the two BJP leaders.

The Municipal Corporation and the estate office had jointly demolished about 1,200 structures at SBS colony on June 6 as part of UT administrationâ€™s â€˜â€˜previousâ€™â€™ zero tolerance agenda.

12,BJP withdraws support to Maya govt,"LUCKNOW: BJP leader and Uttar Pradesh Urban Development Minister Lalji Tandon met governor Vishnukant Shastri on Monday ahead of Chief Minister Mayawati.

Tandon is believed to have given a letter to the governor conveying the decision of his party to withdraw support to the Mayawati-led BSP-BJP government formed in May last year, sources said.

Tandon met the governor after presiding over a meeting of the ministers belonging to BJP and its allies.

Tandon drove to the Rajbhavan soon after the meeting at his official residence after the meeting of the state cabinet where the Chief Minister Mayawati had offered to quit.

Mayawati had also reportedly shifted her belongings from her official residence at 5-Kalidas Marg to her Mall Avenue residence amidst reports of her quitting office.

Sources said the intention to withdraw support was conveyed to the governor on Saturday night when four top state BJP leaders, led by BJP legislature party leader Lalji tandon had met him.

It was done to pre-empt any move by the Chief Minister to recommend dissolution of the Assembly, they said.

Sources said that the Chief Minister, during Monday''s cabinet meeting said that she was of the view that the House should be dissolved and fresh elections held to prevent the Samajwadi Party from coming to power.

13,SP rally in the city,"LUCKNOW: Despite all the political developments in the state since Monday morning, Samajwadi Yuvjan Sabha (SYS) along with activists of other party units including Lohia Vahini, Chattra Sabha and Youth Brigade went ahead with their demonstration here.

Their protests were against the apathetic attitude of the government both in the state and the centre as well, the call for demonstration was given by SP supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav.

Only a few hundreds of party activists, mostly students, assembled at Chattra Sangh Bhawan on Lucknow University campus took part in the rally. With the district police and provincial para-military forces stationed in great numbers, the party activists drew crowds with their sloganeering.

Shouts of ""Roti, kapda sasti ho, dawa-padai mufti ho"" (Food and clothing should be made cheaper while education and medical facilities should be provided for free) and Bekaron ko kaam do, warna bekaari ka bhatta do (Either provide employment to the jobless or unemployment allowance to the needy) filled the air.

Though barely a thousand activists had assembled at the site when the senior leaders including national president of Samajwadi Yuva Sangathan and Member of Parliament (MP) Akhilesh Yadav led the procession on to the road around 12.15 pm as the district administration had permitted the rally between 11 am and 1 pm.

By the time the demonstrating youths reached Pariwartan Chowk, the crowd had swelled to about three thousand and as activists from the adjoining districts continued to pour in. The number kept on increasing.

The demonstration was completely peaceful barring the solitary attempt of Narahi corporator from SP Bantu Yadav attempting to uproot a pole erected at the Chowk to hold the BSP fags.

The police officials accompanying the procession responded quickly and Buntu along with his supporters were forced to beat a hasty retreat.

Though the district administration in a written permission to the SP had allowed the demonstrators to take the Baradari - Nari Shiksha Niketan route to reach the Collectorate, the procession moved to Kaiserbagh crossing to reach Collectorate from the Kaiserbagh Bus Depot road route.

The police officials, after initial efforts to stop the procession, allowed the demonstrators to take the other route in order to eliminate possibilities of any showdown.

The demonstrators reached the Collectorate around 12.45 pm where the leaders addressed the partymen on the issues against which the protest was held.

While Akhilesh Yadav promised unemployment allowance to all the jobless if the SP came to power in the state, the protest concluded with former SP MLA Gauri Shanker Singh coming down heavily on the corruption and deteriorating standards of politics prevailing in the state.

The district president of SP Faqir Siddiqui appreciated the spirit of the youths who had assembled for the protest and declared that such participation from them would surely lead the SP to hold the reigns of the government in the state in the near future.

SP leaders Vijay Singh and Shyam Kishore Yadav also addressed the gathering which finally began to disperse around 1.30 pm and thinned out within the next 15 minutes.

14,Power Grid awaits govt nod for Afghan project,"CHANDIGARH: With 40 per cent of the power generated in the country carried annually on its extensive transmission network, the Power Grid Corporation of India is now gearing to spread its tentacles in Afghanistan.

Power Grid, a Central government undertaking is also endeavouring to create a foothold in US market and negotiate for projects in the transmission sector.

While officials of the corporation will shortly make a beeline for the American continent, in Afghanistan the corporation which achieved a turnover of Rs 2,419 crore and a net profit of Rs 650 crore in 2002-03 is now awaiting Centre''s clearance for undertaking a survey and soil investigation project of the Kabul to Phulkumari belt in Afghanistan for laying of a 300 km 220 KV transmission system.

While the government-to-government negotiations between India and Afghanistan are underway, the clearance for undertaking the investigation as a preliminary exercise is expected to be obtained within the next 2-3 months,points out Power Grid Corporation CMD, R P Singh.

Singh told ET here on Monday that the Afghanistan project worth Rs 300 crore will be to lay in 2 years time a transmission line network between Kabul and Phulkumari in Afghanistan to bring power to the Afghan capital from Uzbekistan.

Another project linking Phulkumari to Uzbekistan involving another Rs 300 crore is to be cleared by the Asian Development Bank(ADB). Power Grid may also bid for this project, he indicated.

This work entails laying of transmission line over a difficult terrain much of which is covered under snow for most of the year. This terrain between Kabul and the Uzbekistan border is said to be at many places at a height of over 5,000 metres above sea level.

He said in Haryana the corporation was further strengthening the transmission network to strengthen the inter-connectivity of Haryana state grid with the northern region grid by injecting Rs 450 crore over the next 3-4 years.

Already, the corporation has established an extensive transmission network of 3,500 circuit km of extra high voltage (EHV) network along with three substations with 2,520 MVA capacity.

He said the schemes proposed to be implemented include series compensation at Ballabhgarh sub station which is introduced for the first time in the country to enhance power transmission capacity in Haryana.

While other transmission schemes like Rihand-II transmission system of about 600 km and establishment of substations at Kaithal, Narwana, Fatehabad and Gurgaon once implemented will not only ensure delivery of Haryana''s share of power from northern grid but will also strengthen states grid for improved power supply.

Referring to the 10 year perspective transmission plan to install an integrated and resilient national power grid in a phased manner by 2012, Singh said some 60,000 km of transmission lines would be established countrywide to augment the inter-regional transfer capacity from the present 8,000 MW to 30,000 MW.

This will involve an investment of Rs 71,000 crore of which Rs 51,000 crore is proposed to be funded through loans from the government, financial institutions, World Bank, ADB and bilateral loans from KFW.

Nearly Rs 20,000 crore is proposed to be invested through private initiative.

He said the first phase of the national grid had been completed and phase two of the project was underway to create one synchronous electrical system from Arunachal Pradesh to Goa, a spread of about 2,800 km.

Of the proposed investment,around Rs 31,000 crore is to be pumped in the 10 th plan period and the rest in the 11 th plan period.

During 10 th plan period between 25,000-30,000 circuit km will be added to its transmission system.And by end of 2012, the circuit km will increase to over one lakh.

Already, around 40,000 MW of power is being carried on the 47,000 circuit km transmission line network of the corporation.

In terms of units, 200 billion units of power annually valued at Rs 35,000 crore is carried on its 47,000 ckt km system which he claimed is maintained at system availability of nearly 99.46 per cent.

Singh said in the current year, between Rs 3,000-3,500 crore worth of projects would be commissioned as against Rs 5,300 crore worth projects commissioned during 2002-03.

During 2002-03 it also commenced construction of projects worth Rs 3,700 crore. By end of 2003-04, the corporation expects to achieve a turnover of around Rs 3,000 crore and a net profit of Rs 850 crore.

He added the corporation has in hand consultancy assignments worth nearly Rs 300 crore.

Power Grid has now initialed an agreement with the government of Haryana, department of Information Technology whereby the former will establish its broadband telecommunication network in Haryana.

The agreement will facilitate Power Grid to lay communication cable along National Highway 1, 8 and 22 connecting various cities enroute in Haryana with Gurgaon, Delhi and Chandigarh.

This will also enable the corporation to extend its connectivity to other cities like Jalandhar, Shimla and Jammu of its 20,000 km nationwide broadband telecom network under implementation.

17,"Maya ditches BJP, seeks polls","LUCKNOW: Uttar Pradesh is once again headed for a deep political crisis as Chief Minister Mayawati lost the support of the 87-member BJP on Monday.

She recommended dissolution of the Assembly rather than quit, much to the embarrassment of the BJP, the major coalition partner, which was keen to contest the forthcoming Lok Sabha polls in alliance with the BSP.

A decision to this effect was taken by her at a Cabinet meeting, which lasted for only 35 minutes, beginning at 10 am. After a suspense of almost two hours, she went straight to the Raj Bhavan around 12.35 pm to convey the decision personally to Governor Vishnukant Shastri.

Like her Cabinet decision, the workers'' rally, which was addressed by her later in the day, was equally important and she made it clear there that she was not ready to reconcile with the BJP till such time that Rajnath Singh and other critics of the BSP, like Vinay Katiyar, are not removed.

But she was ready to compromise with Mulayam Singh Yadav if he apologises publicly for the June 2, 1995 state guest house incident. In the same breath she even said she was not averse to Congress in case it regrets the ill-treatment to the dalits in the past.

While announcing she had severed her ties with the BJP, Mayawati fervently appealed to her party workers to be ready for Assembly elections, which she said might be held along with the Lok Sabha polls.

Mincing no words in denouncing the BJP, she said the party had betrayed her trust and this was evident by a recent remark by Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee in the Lok Sabha against her government and the posture adopted by Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani on her demand for the removal of Union Culture Minister Jagmohan.

Earlier, in her letter to the governor, she said the House should be dissolved in order to avoid large-scale horse-trading, a possibility of which had become strong in view of the efforts being made by the Opposition to destabilise her.

She pointed out that the situation was more explosive in the BJP and the Samajwadi Party where the legislators were ready to cross the floor to become ministers.

Tactfully, she clarified to the media that she had not resigned from her post. She even refused to take cognizance of the BJP''s decision to withdraw its support from her. A letter to this effect was also submitted to governor even before she met him by the BJP legislature party leader, Lalji Tandon.

Tandon came quietly to the Raj Bhavan at around 12 noon and handed over the letter to the governor and sneaked out of the back door in order to avoid waiting journalists.

The governor said that he would take a decision on the issue only after seeking legal opinion. Although the Cabinet was divided over the decision of dissolution of the House, yet it seemed to have some legalities in view of the fact that BSP ministers are in majority in the Cabinet.

The governor has limited options. He may ignore Mayawati''s contention and impose President''s rule in the state after dismissing Mayawati or keep the Assembly in suspended animation to explore possibility for the formation of an alternative government. However, either way, the state seems to be in a deep political crisis.

The worst sufferer is the BJP, which is left in the lurch. Caught napping by the political development, the BJP finds itself unable to defend its position.

A gloom was descended over the BJP office here where party leaders had left for New Delhi to apprise the party''s central leadership about the political situation in the state.

Addressing a meet-the-press programme organised by the Ernakulam Press Club here, he said, besides, people''s anger towards the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) at the Centre and the wrong policies followed by the CPI(M) would also be highlighted during the campaigning for the UDF nominee in the by-polls.

People had given the mandate for the then sitting Congress member George Eden, for five years, but his death had necessitated the by-election, he said and hoped that people would once again repose faith in the UDF nominee.

19,"HC for state govt to design new law, order plan","PATNA: Without passing a written order the Patna High Court on Monday directed the additional advocate general to apprise the court by next date of hearing of the steps taken by the state government on the decisions taken at the high level meeting held on January 21, 2001, under the presidentship of chief minister Rabri Devi to improve the law and order situation of the state, particularly extortion of money and kidnapping for ransom.

When additional advocate general S K Ghose, appearing for the state government, informed the division bench, comprising of Chief Justice Ravi S Dhavan and Justice S K Singh, that in the light of its (court''s) suggestions made on August 5 the process of transfer of policemen right from constables to inspectors, who have been posted at one place for 4 years and more, will be completed by September 15, the bench adjourned the case for further hearing for September 16.

Earlier on August 5 the high court in its order had stated that posting of policemen at one place for more than 3 years had its impact on the deteriorating law and order situation of the state and had suggested their immediate transfer up to the rank of additional director general of police.

The bench, which was hearing on a PIL filed by the Bihar Vyavasayee Sangharsha Morcha, also refused to make any comment on the affidavit, filed on Monday by DIG (Headquarters) Ajit Dutt on behalf of the state government, saying that the court is currently watching the situation and if stern steps are not taken by the state government in the light of the decisions taken at CM''s level meeting, the court will issue necessary directions later.

In course of hearing on Monday the court asked Ghose whether he was in a position to inform the court if the traders left the state for fear of extortion and kidnapping have returned, whether mothers have faith that their sons/daughters would return homes from schools safely, whether a common man feels safe and secure and whether his complaint is recorded in a police station. ""The court will interfere only when the state government fails to restore faith of the common people in it"", the bench stated.

Appearing for the petitioner advocate M P Gupta submitted before the bench that the state government should submit a photocopy of the report sought by the CID in its letter dated February 17 from SPs of different districts on kidnapping cases reported in their respective districts during last 10 years.

He also sought a list of those persons, who are involved in criminal cases and yet have been provided with bodyguards by the state government, how many police force are available with the state government and where is chief secretary''s report, who had to monitor fortnightly the steps taken by the administration to improve law and order situation of the state.

23,Munde calls for dismissal of DF govt,"AURANGABAD\MUMBAI: The twin blasts of black Monday have shaken the Democratic Front government led by chief minister Sushilkumar Shinde. The government appeared to be helpless in dealing with the crisis, issuing what has become a ritualistic call for peace. The Shiv Sena condemned the blasts, but has not called for a bandh.

The BJP, which is holding its state-level convention in Aurangabad, quickly went on the offensive and demanded the summary dismissal of the DF ministry for its alleged incompetence in preventing the blasts which, it said, had been taking place almost with regularity in the last few months.

The BJP''s national general secretary Pramod Mahajan said the government was lackadaisical in its approach to the law and order situation. State BJP president Gopinath Munde, who had handled the home portfolio in the erstwhile Shiv Sena-BJP government, alleged that the police force was in a mess.

Mr Shinde and his party MP Murli Deora politely appealed to the BJP not to politicise the issue. Deputy chief minister Chhagan Bhujbal, who is handling the home department and belongs to the NCP, the junior partner in the ruling state coalition, said the imposition of President''s rule would make no difference. ""The new dispensation will also have to function through the existing set of police officers. This is not the time to indulge in a blame game,"" he advised.

""We are doing our best to thwart terrorist forces. We are also taking the help of central agencies,"" he said. A senior Congress minister said Mr Mahajan had no right to demand the dismissal of the DF government since the BJP-led government at the Centre had ""miserably failed"" to contain terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir. ""The Vajpayee ministry was thoroughly exposed when terrorists entered the parliament complex and opened fire indiscriminately. If we apply Mr Mahajan''s logic, the Vajpayee ministry too should have been sacked,"" the minister noted.

But the Sena-BJP alliance is bent on turning the heat on Mr Shinde and his team. Senior Sena functionaries will meet party chief Bal Thackeray on Tuesday in a bid to finalise the contours of a popular stir, in tandem with the BJP, against the DF government. The Sena''s working president Uddhav Thackeray cut short his Pune visit and rushed back to Mumbai for consultations with the Sena chief, it is learnt.

""The government should quit office as it has lost the right to govern. The Democratic Front is a glorious failure and the law and order situation has collapsed in Mumbai. Policemen are busy collecting money for ministers. As such, they have no time to protect Mumbai,"" Sena leader Raj Thackeray said.

""The present government has been allowing an unchecked influx into the city with an eye on its vote-bank. There is no regulatory authority to curb the flow of migrants into Mumbai,"" he said.

Sena MPs Pritish Nandy and Sanjay Nirupam visited the Gateway of India soon after the explosion. ""The DF government should quit on its own as it has miserably failed to ensure the safety and security of Mumbaikars as well as Mumbai,"" Mr Nirupam said.

24,"Khanna, BJP workers to court arrest on Sept 2 in Gurdaspur","CHANDIGARH: Union minister of state for external affairs Vinod Khanna would be among hundreds of Punjab BJP workers who plan to court arrest in Gurdaspur on September 2 to protest against the alleged ""high-handedness"" of the Amarinder Singh government.

The BJP would also organise a public meeting in Gurdaspur on the same day to highlight the alleged ""police excesses"" in dealing with the BJP workers who had assembled at the Mukerian-Naushera Pattan bridge last week to see Vinod Khanna inaugurate it.

Talking to mediapersons here on Monday, former BJP cabinet ministers, Balramji Dass Tondon, MM Mittal and SP Saini demanded that the Gurdaspur deputy commissioner and the SSP be immediately transferred and a judicial inquiry instituted into the violent clash that took place between the police and the BJP workers at the new bridge.

The three leaders also demanded that criminal cases against state BJP president BL Rinwa and nine other BJP leaders be immediately withdrawn and all the arrested leaders be released. The BJP leaders condemned chief minister Amarinder Singh for adopting a ""confrontationist stance"" on the matter and depriving the â€˜starâ€™ MP from Gurdaspur ""his share of credit"" in the construction of the bridge.

Tondon said the chief minister was indulging in ""cheap politics"" by claiming entire credit for the project in which his government made practically no contribution. He said if the partyâ€™s demands were not conceded by the state government within a month, the BJP would launch a state-wide protest.

The party constituted a fact-finding committee comprising three former ministers and three other senior leaders to look into the circumstances that led to the violent clash.

The team members left for Gurdaspur on Monday and would submit their report within a week.

25,'Mardangi and domestic violence linked in Punjab',"CHANDIGARH: An educated woman from Punjab was forced to take leave for a year. Reason: her husband was unemployed and so he could not tolerate his wife going to work while he sat idle at home. She relented. This is not an isolated case since the the notions of traditional masculinity continue to remain unchanged and where ''mardangi'' stands for power, control and for legitimised violence.

In a highly patriarchal society, the notion of masculinity is not envisaged by individual men. The concept of ''mardangi'' is constructed by society at large and based on traditions and history.

In a recent study exploring masculinity in the ''martial'' society of Punjab, which has formed part of a study titled ''Men, Masculinity and Domestic Violence in India'' conducted by the International Centre for Research on Women in collaboration with the Indian researchers, a researcher at the local Institute of Development and Communication has observed that the Hindu notion of masculinity rests on man being a provider, since most Hindus in Punjab are traders while among Sikhs masculinity is constructed around being a protector of honour, and women are projected as a symbol of honour.

Assessing the forms of male violence within the domestic sphere, the study has observed that within the domestic domain the concept of masculinity is control-oriented. Aggressive masculinity, even within the domestic sphere, enjoys social sanction in the context of sexual infidelity and disobedience. A socially powerful man is supposed to have control over his woman, who is not allowed to refuse his needs, or, of his family members.

Interestingly, in fact the study found violence within home as a norm rather than an aberration in Punjab. The study tries to find linkages between masculinity and the culture of violence in Punjab that reached its peak during the years of militancy. ""In Punjab there is a lot of fascination for uniform and weapons.

Thus, the police and the Army fits into the macho image of a man,""says the researcher Rainuka Daggar. Even the well-off people like to display guns and swords in their living rooms, thereby reasserting the image of masculinity that is supposed to offer ''protection''.

The violent behaviour of men is also used as a tool for identity assertion.

This demands control over their women''s sexuality and reproduction to maintain group exclusivity.

But all this masculinity and macho image of men is being challenged with economic empowerment of women, which men perceive as their deprivation. Men who suffer from reduction of privileges because their women are more educated or better earning are found more violent towards their wives.

A woman''s financial independence that is treated as an advantage at the time of marriage later challenges the husband''s fiefdom. This results in physical violence. It also affects in the context of male sexuality where men begin to perceive themselves as physically inadequate.
