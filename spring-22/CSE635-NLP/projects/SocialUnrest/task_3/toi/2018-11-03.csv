0,Civic polls may not be held in February,"pune: the fate of the pune municipal corporation (pmc) elections, which have been scheduled for february 2002, again hangs in balance because of the delinking of a few fringe village from the city limits. according to highly-placed sources, the state government on friday issued a formal notification for the complete delinking of 15 villages and part-delinking of five villages from the pmc limits. although the notification was yet to reach the pmc, sources said the state government has given the citizens only 15 days to raise objections to the delinking. a senior pmc official said this might force the pmc's election office to re-draw the municipal ward limits once again. effectively, it may not be possible to hold the elections in february 2002, as planned. it may be noted that just two days ago, the pmc's election office had submitted to the state election commissioner a 146-ward demarcation proposal, comprising all 38 fringe villages. the state election commissioner had accepted the proposal, saying it was due at least three months in advance of the polls. moreover, the process of inviting citizens' objections would have taken at least two months. the election process could not have been kept on hold until then, if the elections were to be held in february. now, with the state government issuing a notification asking the citizens to file the suggestions and objections within an unprecedented 15 days, it suddenly seems possible to reassign ward limits two months ahead of the election. ""however, the question remains, as to when the elections will be held, and if they would be held in all the fringe villages "" a senior officer from the pmc's election office said. meanwhile, sources said a group of bjp corporators were contemplating to challenge the delinking of the villages in the courts. even if the courts issue a one-month stay in the matter, the pmc would be forced to conduct the elections in 146 wards for all 38 villages, a corporator said.

""but this can not be solved by enacting laws that do away with the legal safeguards that are designed to prevent innocent persons from being prosecuted and punished,"" he said. criticising the government for not sending a copy of poto to the commission, he said: ""we got a copy from a journalist."" justice verma also questioned the need for the law saying, ""the problem cannot be solved by providing for a different and more drastic procedure for prosecution of a certain crime, by making confessions before the police admissible evidence - which is contrary to the evidence act - and creating special courts."" the government should adopt strategies to deal with terrorism, which balance the dignity of individuals with national security, he observed. ""public interest will always outweigh individual interest but not to the extent that any one of them is rendered totally irrelevant."" justice verma advised parliament to ""see whether there is any need for such a law"". on his part, pande asserted that the ordinance provided safeguards on nhrc's concerns about the draft bill the law commission had prepared.the nhrc had said the provisions of the draft bill were not in consonance with international treaties/instruments of human rights etc. ""promulgation of the ordinance implements in part the obligation on members states imposed by the united nations security council resolution no 1373 on september 28, 2001,"" pande said. on the nhrc's objection to confession before police officer being made admissible as evidence, pande said: ""section 32(2) of poto provides that no one can be compelled or induced to make a confession. it provides for recording of confession before the chief judicial magistrate within 48 hours, unlike the tada, and recording of confession by a police officer not below the rank of superintendent of police."" nhrc had also objected to the poto provision for punishment to those possessing information relating to a terrorist act and said this would have a chilling effect on human rights and jeopardise professionals like journalists. ""much has been made out of this issue in the media without understanding that this provision already exists under section 187 of the indian penal code and section 39 of criminal procedure code. the only difference is that the ordinance prescribes a heavier punishment... even then additional safeguards have been provided,"" pande explained.

25,BJP to make terror law poll mantra,"amritsar: for the bjp, the controversial prevention of terrorism ordinance (poto) has become the perfect vehicle to carry its creed of ""nationalism"" and also a stick with which to beat the congress, its main rival in national politics, in the run- up to assembly elections in up, uttaranchal, punjab, manipur and jammu and kashmir, all slated for 2002. in fact, bjp parliamentary party spokesperson v k malhotra announced poto would be an election issue. and if a message emanated from the two-day meeting of the national executive of the bjp which concluded here on saturday, it was that party workers should fan out across the country, ""raise the temperature on the terrorism issue"" and create public opinion for the passage of poto by posing the line given to party members by home minister l k advani on friday: ""those who are opposing poto are appeasing terrorists."" the tenor of the resolution that was adopted on terrorism matched this rhetoric, stating that while india had chosen for the moment not to pursue the policy of hot pursuit, ""if the situation demands, circumstances compel and national interest requires it, nothing should come in the way of the country going all out to eliminate terrorism from both inside and outside the country"". to back this, the resolution pointed out that ""the us, aided by the uk...has chosen to pursue the policy of hot pursuit, crossing countries and continents in their fight against international terrorism, thereby justifying their stand"". but even as it was clear that terrorism was on top of the party's agenda with party president jana krishnamurthy announcing that november 18 would be observed as ""national unity against terrorism day"", differences emerged between the pm and home minister on the approach to be adopted. while vajpayee stressed the need for a consensual approach involving opposition parties, advani made it clear that that those who did not support poto were ""appeasing terrorists"". but even if this could be interpreted as two men addressing different constituencies in tandem, what added to the confusion was krishnamurthy denying that advani had used such strong language, even though law minister arun jaitley, while briefing the press friday night on advani's intervention on the subject, quoted him as having said as much. meanwhile, it was evident that the bjp was trying hard to ignore the murmurs of protest against poto coming from its allies in the nda — whether it is the dmk, the tdp, sections of the samata party or even akali dal. the party has decided instead to concentrate its gunfire on the congress, which a senior cabinet minister described as ""our most reasonable partner in the opposition"", given that it was the party which had given the country poto's predecessor, tada. and in up, it will use the same issue to attack the samajwadi party, which is also opposing poto. clearly, the bjp, which has to face crucial assembly elections next year, is hoping the terrorism issue will help it emerge as the sole protector of national interest and make its rivals look ""anti-national"".
