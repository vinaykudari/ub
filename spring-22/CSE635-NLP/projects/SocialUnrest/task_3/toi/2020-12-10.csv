0,Mirchi continues to rule city roads,"MUMBAI: Listening to Radio Mirchi seems to be the favourite pastime for thousands of executives and businesspersons driving to and from work in Mumbaiâ€™s busy rush-hour traffic.

This and many other interesting facts were thrown up by a series of car-track radio surveys conducted by IMRB (Indian Market Research Bureau) between October and December.

The survey, conducted at ten prominent hightraffic locations across Mumbai, revealed that Radio Mirchi 98.3 FM is the most listened to private FM Radio station in the city.

A car-track survey conducted on December 2 had revealed that Radio Mirchi recorded a market share of 37 per cent while its closest competitor recorded a mere 26 per cent.

Car-tracks conducted over the last few months have also thrown up similar results with Radio Mirchi staying ahead of the competition.

Explaining radio listenership surveys in India, Hemant Mehta, vice president and country manager, IMRB, said that unlike print and television, radio was a relatively new medium in India and did not still have any continuous, industry system to track radio listenership patterns.

In the Day-After Recall research method, the maximum emphasis is on the respondentâ€™s memory and Top-OMind Recall, whereas car-track surveys involve the physical checking of the radio station frequency on the deck of the listenerâ€™s car panel, thus leaving little room for errors.

Radio Mirchi is the only private FM Radio channel with the largest national footprint in the country. Radio Mirchi is on air in Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, Chennai, Ahmedabad, Pune and Indore, thus becoming Indiaâ€™s only private FM Radio channel with stations across seven cities, including all four metros.

1,18 band members arrested,"NEW DELHI: A city court on Wednesday sent 18 bandwallahs to jail, a day after they had been arrested by the police from outside a Vasant Kunj farmhouse.

The bandwallahs had been arrested under Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) which prohibits more than five persons from gathering at one place.

The traffic police had imposed this section to ease out the congestion which takes place due to marriages being held in farmhouses.

The police had enforced this on several roads, including the one from Mehrauli to Mahipalpur, Najafgarh road, Chattarpur road and parts of New Delhi.

The accused, who belonged to Maharaja Band, were produced before the metropolitan magistrate S K Saxena, on Wednesday.

But when the owner of the band, Shyam Kumar came to court for their bail, the police arrested him as well.

2,MCD policy not to affect existing shops,"NEW DELHI: The BJP leader in MCD''s standing committee, Vijender Gupta, on Wednesday said the policy to confiscate residential buildings with shops will not affect the existing buildings.

Heading a four-member panel, which proposed guidelines to check shops in residential areas, Gupta said: ""Residential buildings which are already being used for shops should be regularised. But in future, if a shop is opened illegally in a newly-built house, the entire building will be confiscated by the MCD,"" he said.

The standing committee on Tuesday cleared a proposal that will penalise future encroachment and misuse of land, especially shops in residential areas. It seeks to regularise the existing 300 sqm residential buildings on main roads being used for commercial purposes.

The proposal will now be discussed in the the MCD House. Following this it will go to the Union Ministry of Urban Development and Poverty Alleviation for changes in the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, in accordance with the Delhi Master Plan 2021. The entire process may take up to one year.

The committee has also suggested strict action against those buildings with 25 per cent or less commercial activity. ""Buildings, on main roads, with area of 300 sq m or more, that have commercial activity can be confiscated,"" he said.

The committee plans to document the status of these buildings through geographical information system (GIS) maps, so that information is available on unauthorised constructions.

3,Doctor's family incensed with Gurgaon cops,"NEW DELHI: J K Gupta had been camping at the Rajinder Nagar police station for five days. On Sunday, he heaved a sigh of relief when the police told him that his younger brother, R K Gupta''s car was found in Faridabad. But hope soon made way for gloom.

The news of his brother''s murder on early Wednesday morning shattered him. ""The family had hoped to meet him alive,"" said Gupta, also a doctor. ""He was a harmless person and was always pre-occupied with work. Being dedicated to his profession, he had a flourishing private practice at home,"" he added.

While his wife and daughters refused to talk, the other family members criticised the Haryana police for ""their negligence"".

The Gurgaon police reportedly cremated the body without informing their counterparts or the doctor''s family in Delhi. Gupta''s family was incensed at the fact that they were not even able to perform the last rites.

Retired assistant commissioner of police and Gupta''s relative, Mathuram Mittal said: ""The Gurgaon police had recovered the body on December 7, two days after the alleged murder.""

Gurgaon police did not ""perform their duty as a responsible police force"" by informing that they had found a body. They, reportedly, preserved the body for 72 hours at Rohtak Medical College.

""Despite all the publicity in the media, Gurgaon police cremated the body without informing anybody,"" said Mittal.

Ironically, they have preserved just one bone from the doctor''s body for the DNA test, he added. Mittal said the Delhi Police had kept the family abreast with the investigations on the case.

DCP (central) Arvind Deep said his team had sent messages to the Haryana police on time. He, however, refused to elaborate on why they did not receive a timely response from the Gurgaon police.

He claimed that the absence of body as evidence would not affect the case. ""DNA finger-printing will be the crucial piece of evidence for us,"" he said.

4,MCH opposes diverting funds for govt work,"HYDERABAD: The standing committee of the Municipal Corporation of Hyderabad (MCH) on Wednesday unanimously approved the budget estimates for 2004-05.

The panel sought some changes in the budget and also protested against spending MCH money for the government events.

The budget, proposed by MCH commissioner Chitra Ramachandran and approved by the standing committee, will be placed in the MCH general body for approval before January 10. Ramachandran said MCH has placed the budget in time before the committee for its approval.

The total outlay in the budget is Rs 680.69 crore. The standing committee, while approving the budget, proposed reduction of the expenditure on major nalas and storm water drains from Rs 8 crore each to Rs 6 crore each, for parks and traffic islands from Rs 14.50 crore to Rs 6.50 crore.

The committee sought to increase the expenditure on road development and upgradation from Rs 30 crore to Rs 42 crore.

Committee chairman Abdul Rahman Khan said the construction of flyovers not the function of MCH. ""There is already a separate provision in the state budget, ''Transport, roads and buildings'' for them,'''' he said.

Khan said huge amounts were spent on Afro-Asian Games which again was not the function of MCH. The source of revenue and the expenditure incurred for were not given in the budget.

Transfer of funds from MCH to other authorities like Quli Qutub Shah Urban Development Authority, which have their own budget provisions, is against the financial interests of the corporation.

5,‘Riots engineered by political parties’,"HYDERABAD: The clashes witnessed in the Old City last week were political and not communal in nature, City Civil Liberties Monitoring Committee (CLMC) said on Wednesday.

The riots were engineered by the BJP, VHP and TDP combine to gain political mileage in the forthcoming elections, the CLMC, comprising 17 Muslim and non-Muslim organisations, said.

Addressing a press conference here, CLMC leaders Moulana Raheem Qureshi, Lateef Mohammed Khan, Ratnamala, Leo Augustine and others alleged that the police had failed to handle the situation despite having prior information about possible group clashes in the city.

The committee leaders demanded that the state government should announce an ex gratia to the bereaved families besides providing medical aid to the injured.

6,‘Anti-social elements behind clashes’,"HYDERABAD: Representatives of Left-wing parties, who visited the riot-affected areas in the Old City on Wednesday, felt that the clashes were engineered by anti-social elements in a pre-determined manner.

They demanded the government to punish the guilty and pay compensation to the families of those killed in the riots and individuals who were injured.

State secretaries of CPI and CPM, Suravaram Sudhakar Reddy and B V Raghavulu, respectively, CPI-ML New Democracy leader Sambasiva Rao, SUCI leader Sridhar and others visited Gowlipura market, Sultan Shahi, Haveli Kaman, Moghalpura, outside Gowlipura, Lal Darwaja and other localities. They interacted with the locals who bore the brunt of the riots and curfew.

Speaking to reporters later, Sudhakar Reddy said the houses looted did not belong to any particular community.

That indicated that the riots were the handiwork of anti-social forces and was a deliberate attempt to disturb peace and communal harmony in the state, he said.

The TDP government, which was spending crores of rupees for welfare schemes, had not provided any succour to the riot-hit families, he said.

7,"Fresh bout of violence hits Old City, 4 hurt","HYDERABAD: Hours after city police commissioner R P Singh claimed that normalcy was fast returning to the Old City and curfew could be lifted from Friday, fresh riots broke out in Kulsumpura and Mangalhat police station limits of West Zone on Wednesday night.

Four persons sustained stab wounds and head injuries when rioters attacked them late in the evening. The injured have been rushed to the Osmania General Hospital for treatment.

According to eye witnesses, the rioters came in four auto rickshaws and pelted stones indiscriminately near a toddy compound in Jiyaguda at around 9.30 pm. Residents and shop keepers shut the doors out of fear, while passersby tried to escape into lanes and bylanes.

Police forces were rushed to the spot and dispersed the mob. The situation is now under control, Singh said.

8,"Naoroji's house for sale, govt gives NOC","NAVSARI: The row over the ancestral home of Dadabhai Naoroji at Katrakwad here has ended. The government has decided to give NOC to its owner Prakash Joshi. He wanted to sell it at a premium, blocking the governmentâ€™s efforts to preserve it as a monument.

Earlier, the government had declared its intention to make it a monument of historical significance, said resident deputy collector J B Patel. Accordingly, some local trusts were invited to negotiate with Joshi, whose elders had bought the house from Naoroji family decades ago.

In fact, a local trust managed by some Parsis here offered a price of Rs 6.51 lakh and Joshi had agreed to the proposal and even took Rs 51,000 as token money, Patel said. But, later he demanded Rs 20 lakh, to which the Parsis said no, officials said. Meanwhile, expert opinion about the condition of the house was sought.

They felt that the house in its dilapidated form was not fit for preservation, Patel said. Joshi, desperate to get a higher price, went on hunger strike twice, seeking quick action by the authorities, said a local resident. On Monday he undertook a fast which prompted collectorate officials to summon him for a meeting, wherein they decided to give him a NOC, Patel said.

9,Anand riot victims still stay away from home,"ANAND: A large number of residents of Mogri village near here, who were driven out of their homes by mobs on March 3 last year, are still not able to return and complained to the district collector on Wednesday.

About 50 families belonging to the minority community gathered under the banner of Jamiat-E-Ulma-EHind to protest the â€œlack of effective steps by the administration to rehabilitate persons from the minority community who had migrated during the riots last year.â€� The group submitted a memorandum to district collector Y L Dave, informing him about the social boycott they face in Mogri, more than a year after they were driven out of their homes.

â€œWe have learnt that both the police and the officials looking after rehabilitation are working under political pressure. We have been told that we can return to the village only if we take back the complaints we have filed,â€� said secretary of the group,M G Gujarati. â€œHindus shouted slogans during a recent meeting between minority community leaders and government officers,â€� he said. â€œThe mobs destroyed property worth Rs 3 lakh, but I got only Rs 12,000 as compensation. We live in a rented house in Anand and do not have money to build a new house.

When members of our community tried to build 12 houses in Ambawadi and Mafatpura areas of our village, they were razed to the ground. We do not know when we will have a secure future,â€� said Sukhiyaben Vora of Mogri. â€œI have been living with my daughter in Anand since March 2002. I have been stopped every time I tried to return to Mogri. They have abused me and pelted stones on us,â€� said 75-year-old Aminaben. â€œOur complaints have had no effect.

Those named in the FIR are now living in the UK, while others are roaming free,â€� said Ismailbhai Rasoolbhai. â€œMogri is not the only village that experiences this fate. Other villages like Sisva, Sunav,Virsad and Ode have also witnessed social boycott of minorities. In Sunav, only those from the minority community were allowed who had not lodge complaints. In Ode and Sisva, Muslims live in neighbouring fields and are still not a part of the village,â€� said M G Gujarati.

10,State slips in human development,"GANDHINAGAR: Gujarat is placed sixth among states in terms of the human development index (HDI), behind Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Punjab and Karnataka. The state has slipped one rank from its position four years ago.

The Gujarat Human Development Report 2003, which is awaiting official release, regrets that the stateâ€™s economic growth could not get translated into human development. First prepared in 1999, the report has never been made public. Now, it has been revised with the latest available data, but it is still not clear whether Chief Minister Narendra Modi wants to officially release these not-so-pleasing statistics.

The 350-page report, prepared for the state government by the Gandhi Labour Institute with full cooperation of the relevant government departments, says, â€œThe state has reached only 48 per cent of the goals set for human development. Further, it comes in the category of low human development as per the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) definition, where entities with an index value of less than 0.500 are called countries with low human development.â€� Funded by the UNDP and prepared under a Planning Commission directive to 15 major Indian states, the report identifies four states â€” Kerala (0.533), Maharashtra (0.530), Punjab (0.528) and Tamil Nadu (0.512) with a high index value.

Karnataka is fifth with an index value of 0.497. Gujaratâ€™s index value is 0.479, according to the report. It explains that the state has fallen behind in most of the categories â€” income, education, health and gender participation. The report says, â€œThe state is ranked at the sixth position because of its good performance in the housing index, where it ranks second. In the income index, the state is sixth, in education sixth, in health ninth. Good performance in housing is offset by the dismal performance in gender participation, where Gujarat ranks eleventh.â€�

â€œTamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh have remarkably improved values on the health index. Karnataka has improved in education. This has not been the case with Gujarat, which registered a modest improvement,â€� says the report. Written by two women experts, Indira Hirway and Darshini Mahadevia, the report underlines that in gender equality, Gujarat is in the company of Madhya Pradesh (12th), Tamil Nadu (13th) Orissa (14th) and Bihar (15th). The gender equality index (GEI) is a direct measure of equality between men and women.

The poor human development is due to the failure of the state to develop in macro-level aspects comprising of environment, basic services, regional disparity etc. In basic services, the state is second, but it is thirteenth in environment, ninth in regional disparity and ninth in patriarchy. Says the report, if these macro-level indices are not improved, â€œhuman development at the individual level will suffer, in turn adversely affecting economic developmentâ€�.

A significant chapter in the report, on managing disasters and conflicts, was removed under pressure as it contained references to the communal riots of 2002. Yet, the preface to the report says, â€œConflicts are difficult to address. It requires a strong commitment of the civil society and government.... sustainable human development in the state is affected by how these are managed.â€�

11,No public comments on party affairs: Antony,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Kerala Chief Minister A K Antony on Wednesday refused to comment on the reported statement of KPCC president K Muraleedharan that the Congress would have a difficult time in facing next year''s Parliament election in the state with him heading the government.

Answering reporters'' queries on the squabbles in the state Congress, Antony said that he was not going to make public comments on party affairs and trigger a controversy.

""The Congress crisis is a Congress family affair and the party is capable of overcoming it,"" Antony said.

To a question, Antony said that the crisis had not crippled the administration but had dented the image of the government.

On the drubbing the Congress received in three northern states in the Assembly election, Antony, who was also a member of the selection committee of candidates, said it was a setback.

""Victory and failure in elections was part of parliamentary democracy and Congress would bounce back,"" he said.

12,ICHR head flays govt decision to oust him,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Indian Council of Historical Research (ICHR) chairman M G S Narayanan, who was removed from his post by the Union government on Wednesday, said that the action was ""illegal and arbitrary"".

""The ICHR chairman is appointed for a term of three years under rule 3 read with rule 13 of ICHR. According to these rules, there is no provision to withdraw such nomination and that too without assigning reason. The position of the chairman is purely honorary,"" he said in a statement from Kozhikode.

The present order was the culmination of a series of illegal and irregular acts committed by the HRD ministry officials during the last two years under pressure from some ruling party circles, the statement said.

""On assuming charge as chairman on July 4, 2001 I came to know about various irregularities of two of my immediate predecessors as Chairmen who were known as committed RSS activists. We also had to terminate the services of two persons who had violated all rules and claimed immunity from office discipline,"" he said.

""At every stage, obstructionist tactics were adopted by the ministry officials though they were forced to withdraw some of their irregulation actions under strong protest from the chairman,"" Narayanan added.

13,Mahotsav incident finds echo in House,"LUCKNOW: Ugly incidents of alleged molestation of girls at Lucknow Mahotsav on Tuesday night, figured prominently in the House as BJP MLAs demanded a probe and punishment to the guilty.

Raising the issue on the floor of the House, Shayam Deo Rai Chaudhary from the BJP accused senior district officials of acting like awe-struck fans, while the unruly crowd went on the rampage. Officers, accompanied by their wives, he said, were busy being photographed with Hrithik Roshan while young girls were being disrobed by miscreants. He also accused the district police of being mute spectators during the incident.

Highly enraged Hukum Singh, Ghanshaym Shukla and others also joined in alleging total mismanagement on part of the district management which led to the unfortunate incidents.

However, even as BJP MLAs raised pandemonium over the issue, minister for parliamentary affairs Mohammad Azam Khan played down the incident by claiming that their version was highly exaggerated. No such molestation or disrobing had taken place, said Khan, adding functions like these were meant to provide entertainment and were highly appreciated.

14,Officials rack brains over mayor rule,"KOLKATA: The mayorâ€™s diktat will be carried out. The city will be purged of vulgar hoardings... but will someone define â€˜obsceneâ€™.

This question was doing the rounds in the corporation corridors on Wednesday, and none was more desperate for an answer than the three officials the mayor has entrusted with the job.

Joint municipal commissioner Deb Kumar Chakraborty, municipal secretary Sajal Bhowmick and chief engineer (roads) Sajal Banerjee are tasked with identifying hoardings that could be classified as â€œobsceneâ€�.

But more than the dictionary definition, officials are worried about the legal interpretation of the term. They have only a fortnight to complete the job.

â€œIdentifying illegal hoardings is no problem. But how will we brand a hoarding as â€˜obsceneâ€™? It will definitely land us in trouble,â€� said a member of the committee.

The KMC Act has a clause on â€œvisual pollutionâ€� but KMC officials are not very sure whether itâ€™s enough to haul up top advertising agencies for â€œobscenityâ€�. â€œIf challenged in court, we will have no defence,â€� a KMC law official admitted.

The mayor would have none of the debate. He again made it clear to his officials on Wednesday that the drive against obscene and illegal hoardings wasnâ€™t a cosmetic touch-up job but an aggressive crackdown. The corporation might not be able to do anything about Kolkata being a â€œcity of ralliesâ€� but it can certainly clean its image as a â€œcity of hoardingsâ€�.

â€œWe canâ€™t allow hoardings to be displayed in such a haphazard manner,â€� he said. He had support from MMiC Mala Roy, who is confident that the mission has the support of Kolkataâ€™s people. â€œI did not face any resistance when I pulled down several obscene hoardings a couple of years ago,â€� Roy said.

The controversy over obscenity apart, itâ€™s a fact that Kolkataâ€™s skyline is cluttered with hoardings. Over 2,000 rooftop billboards were set up last year alone. The KMDA and PWD have granted permission for dozens more hoardings in central Kolkata.

â€œAt least 500 billboards have come up this year in different parts of the city,â€� said a KMC amusement department official. Department records say that the revenue from hoarding tax jumped from Rs 4.5 crore last year to Rs 8 crore this year. The drive will hit the KMC coffers, but the mayor had made his intent clear â€” â€œcultureâ€� comes first, revenue be damned.

Kolkataâ€™s intellectuals have reacted sharply to KMCâ€™s moral policing of the city skyline. They agree that illegal hoardings should be pulled down, but are critical of the corporationâ€™s sudden prudishness.

Sunil Gangopadhyay: Itâ€™s not the KMCâ€™s job to label a certain advertisement as obscene. Who defines obscenity, any way? The KMC should rather concentrate on beautifying the city.

Shova Sen (theatre personality): Itâ€™s ridiculous to think that engineers are the best persons to determine what is obscene and whatâ€™s not. I certainly havenâ€™t seen obscenity in any of the hoardings displayed in Kolkata.

Shatabdi Roy (actor): I have not known any instance where obscenity was encouraged through hoardings. Besides, who has the final word on such a sensitive issue? But I do feel that there should be some curbs on vulgar film posters.

Shanu Lahiri (painter): I donâ€™t support KMCâ€™s acting as the moral police. Visual pollution, to me, is the sight of billboards shutting out the skyline and masking heritage buildings. This doesnâ€™t happen anywhere else in the world.

15,"Keep away from riot victims: Panel orders Guj police, VHP, BJP","AHMEDABAD: The two-man inquiry commission, probing Godhra train carnage and its aftermath on Thursday ordered Gujarat police, VHP and BJP to ""keep away"" from several riot witness/victims from Vatva area till their cross-examination was completed by the prosecution.

Justice (retd) G T Nanavati and Justice (retd) K G Shah of the commission are on Thursday recording the depositions of 11 witnesses from Vatva, whose names were given to them in a ""sealed cover"" by advocate Mukul Sinha.

The commission also adjourned the cross-examination of these witnesses after state government''s special counsel Arvind Pandya submitted that ""as the identity and addresses of these witnesses were kept confidential and were revealed only today, the prosecution is not in a position to effectively cross-examine them.""

Pandya submitted that the prosecution must get ""adequate time to gather facts and legal papers pertaining to the witnesses"".

Sinha, however, opposed the adjournment expressing apprehension that government agencies, VHP and BJP may try to ""pressurise these witnesses"", since names of several were disclosed during the recording of their deposition on Thursday.

Justice Nanavati and Justice Shah, however, ordered that the agencies, VHP and BJP must not try to contact them or pressurise them directly or indirectly in the period from the date of adjournment till cross-examination is completed.

""If this is done, the commission will take a serious note of it and order appropriate action against them,"" they said.

16,Cong rules out leadership change in Punjab,"NEW DELHI: Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Thursday got a reprieve with the Congress ruling out any change in leadership and all nine MPs coming out openly in his support even as the dissident group, claiming majority in the Congress Legislature Party, declared a ""war on the Chief Minister.""

Convenor of Punjab Congress in Lok Sabha, Jagmeet Singh Brar told reporters here that ""all the nine MPs had informed the three-member AICC committee and the party leadership that Congress in Punjab was fighting a crucial battle against corruption and any change in leadership would prove counter-productive.""

Brar said that all the nine MPs would meet the AICC committee and also the party president on Friday to convey their feelings.

The Congress spokesman, meanwhile, ruled out any change of leadership in Punjab now and said grievances of party members could be sorted out amicably.

""There is no such possibility immediately. I cannot see any such possibility,"" party spokesman Satyavrat Chaturvedi told reporters here. However, he said if there were any grievances from the partymen in Punjab, it could be sorted out amicably through mutual consultation.

Bhattal, meanwhile ""declared a war against the Chief Minister"" and again claimed majority in the ALP, but stopped short of coming out with the signed list of MLAs as she had promised to do.

""We are not coming out with the list of MLAs at this juncture because they could be easily pressurised by the people in power. But we will certainly show the list when the party President invites us,"" Bhattal said.

Openly voicing her demand for Singh''s removal, Bhattal said that she would go back to the state only after Singh was removed from the post by the party high command.

Bhattal group sources claimed they had already received the signatures of 32 MLAs and were expecting three more on Thursday.

But political advisor to the Chief Minister, Rana Gurmit Singh Sodhi, dismissed the claim. ""Governments are not run by I-cards and signatures. The party high command decides the way government would be run in the state,"" he said.

Denying the allegation that they had paraded the MLAs on Wednesday, Sodhi said ""we have just given the list of 40 MLAs who met the AICC committee from our side. We did not parade them.""

""We are now waiting for the decision of the high command and would do whatever they want us to do,"" he said.

The dissident group, however, appeared to be in no mood for compromise with Bhattal openly saying ""what does he think, the government will run according to his style... we will remove him and only then go from here.""
