0,NCP has lost its political identity: Cong,"KOZHIKODE: The NCP has no moral right to continue as a party in the wake of its recent overtures to the Congress, led by Sonia Gandhi, Congress (S) Kerala President Kadanapally S Ramachandran said on Thursday.

""NCP was formed after its founder leaders Sharad Pawar and P A Sangma opposed Sonia''s leadership in Congress and raking up her nationality issue. But, with the party now resorting to a major policy shift, it has lost its political identity totally,"" he told a press conference here.

""NCP''s very foundation has lost basis with its principles becoming quite irrelevant,"" Ramachandran, who earlier quit the state NCP to revive the Congress(S), said, adding the people would also henceforth reject NCP as a party.

Briefing on the decisions taken at the Congress(S) state camp held at Kottayam recently, he said his party would observe March 26 as `black day'' to protest against POTA.

It would also hold statewide protest marches in February against the `anti-people'' policies of both state and Central Governments, while it would launch a membership drive across the state in March, he added.

1,CBI hires Portuguese law firm to fight Bedi,"NEW DELHI: The CBI has hired a law firm in Portugal to fight actress Monica Bediâ€™s appeal to the countryâ€™s supreme court to reject a Lisbon high court order for her extradition to India.

Bedi, who had fled to Portugal with underworld don Abu Salem, has also petitioned the Portuguese government for political asylum. She has claimed she does not expect a fair trial in an Indian court for being a member of a minority community.

Bedi has sought review of the high court order citing apprehension of judicial discrimination.

The CBI has countered her claim by providing copies of landmark judgments of Indian courts in sensitive cases upholding minority rights.

The agency has demanded that she be extradited to face trial for using forged documents to acquire a passport to travel to Portugal. Bediâ€™s passport is in the name of Sana Kamal Malik with an address in Andhra Pradesh. Using forged documents is an offence in Portugal as well.

2,Prabhu keen to convince CM on river linking,"MUMBAI: Suresh Prabhu, chairman of the River Linking Project (RLP) task force, has asked the National Water Development Authority (NWDA) to explore the possibility of supplying the Koyna damâ€™s excess water to Mumbai, to end the water shortage problem of the metropolis and its surroundings.

Mr Prabhu told TNN that this was one of the proposals he had mooted to benefit Maharashtra under the RLP. However, chief minister Sushilkumar Shinde and other senior Maharashtra ministers had told Mr Prabhu in no uncertain terms that the RLP would not help the state in its present form. The former Union energy minister was here to liaise with the Maharashtra government regarding its participation in the RLP, which he feels will change the face of Indian agriculture and economy.

Handpicked by Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee to head the Rs 560 billion RLP after his abrupt exit from the Union cabinet, Mr Prabhu said the task force had been able to achieve a broad consensus among the states and political leaders to participate in the RLP activities. â€œMr Vajpayee will soon inaugurate the ambitious 20-year project,â€™â€™ an elated Mr Prabhu announced.

He clarified that Maharashtra was free to go ahead with its own programme of interlinking the rivers within the state. Such a step would certainly be laudable, he observed. In view of the governmentâ€™s reservation, Mr Prabhu is slated to make another visit to Mumbai shortly. Meanwhile, he has asked the Maharashtra government to prepare a proposal whereby the Centre can extend assistance to the state.

Mr Prabhu recalled that Subhash Desai, Shiv Sena leader and then chairman of the statutory development board for the rest of Maharashtra, had submitted a proposal on supplying Koynaâ€™s excess water to Mumbai over eight years ago, which came to naught. The idea of diverting to Mumbai a substantial amount of water from the Koyna that flowed into the sea after power generation, which could also benefit agriculturists and industries in Ratnagiri and Raigad districts, was worth examining, Mr Prabhu felt.

Mr Prabhu claimed that except for Kerala, he had managed to convince every chief minister about the advisability of the project, and that all prominent political leaders, including Congress president Sonia Gandhi, had accepted the project in principle. Mr Prabhu claimed that he had addressed issues like the rehabilitation of the affected people, impact on the environment and the cost of the project, and that the project would generate one crore jobs every year. Mr Prabhu said he was happy that a fundamental debate on water had started nationwide, as water would become the most precious natural resource in another two decades.

4,Survey on farmers' suicide,"BANGALORE: A TNS Mode survey commissioned by the Jawaharlal National Youth Centre (JNYC) has found that crop failure was the main reason for farmers committing suicide in the state.

JNYC convener (Karnataka) Ashwin Kumar, in a press statement, said extensive research was conducted in 18 villages of Mandya district.

""In all cases, victims had outstanding loans from Rs 10,000 to Rs 1 lakh. The family members and village leaders interviewed reported the inability of farmers to recover the investments made,"" he added.

According to village leaders, farmers, who depended on KRS water faced hardship for three consecutive years owing to drought.

""This apart, the report findings reveal that victims spent considerable amount on loan repayment and interest, which was an added burden,"" he stated.

The farmers sought waiver loans, supply of seeds and pesticides at subsidised rates and crop insurance.

The JNYC urged the government to assist farmers in distress.

6,Panel raps J&K govt for Dal Lake mess,"NEW DELHI: The urgency to save Srinagarâ€™s Dal Lake from encroachment and pollution is as important as countering terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir, a standing committee of Parliament which intervened in the matter has acknowledged.

The famous Dal Lake of Srinagar, which sustains the livelihood of more than 50,000 people, has shrunk 50 per cent from its original size of 22 sq km to merely 11 sq km due to encroachment and pollution. In 1998, Helmut Kroiss, professor at the Vienna University had reported, â€˜â€˜Dal Lake, the beauty of Kashmir, is in a critical state since waste water, solid waste and fertiliser discharge to the lake have caused increased eutrophication with excessive growth of weed and algae in most of the areas.â€™â€™

The Parliamentary committee noted in its recommendations, which was unanimously adopted last week, â€˜â€˜The committee is of the firm belief that conservation of Dal Lake is a national issue. It forms the axis of life for the Kashmir valley and therefore, it is not only important from the point of view of ecology, but also from the point of augmenting economy of the people and ensuring peace in the region.â€™â€™

The chairman of the Parliamentary committee was C Ramachandraiah who, along with other members of the committee, was amazed to note that â€˜â€˜there had been no sustained and serious effort to clean the lake during the last several yearsâ€™â€™. It further noted that of the â€˜â€˜huge sums of money provided by the Central government, only 20 per cent were actually spent and that too towards meeting the establishment costâ€™â€™.

It was pointed out that â€˜â€˜interests of tourists on Dal Lake had declined due to pollution of its water massâ€™â€™. The committee also noted that the state government had spent Rs 267 crores to prepare 24 reports, the implementation of which is hardly there to see. The Centre for Science and Environment representative Richard Mahapatra said that livelihood of a large number of people was linked to the lake. Therefore, people should be involved in its conservation. He alleged that the way the J&K Lake and Waterways Development Authority was going about â€˜â€˜it was preparing for the funeral of the Dal Lake.â€™â€™

Members felt the government should evolve a time-bound programme and establish a monitoring mechanism to implement the plan so that the lake is conserved. As a first step to removing encroachment, the Parliamentary committee recommended that the J&K Lake and Waterways Development Authority, which is located inside the lake, â€˜â€˜must be shifted outâ€™â€™.

So moved was MP Saif-Ud-Din Soz with MPs taking interest in the issue that he remarked, â€˜â€˜Perhaps, this was the first time that any Parliamentary committee was devoting its attention to a matter so deeply and meticulously.â€™â€™
