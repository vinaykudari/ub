0,Sealed emergency gate increased casualty figures,"KOLKATA: Passengers who tried to escape from the ill-fated bus in Howrah through the emergency gate could not do so because the gate was sealed, preliminary investigation carried out by the fire service and the police revealed.

â€œOur preliminary investigation revealed that the emergency gate was sealed from outside, leading to a high death toll,â€� a senior Howrah district police officer said. â€œBut we need the confirmation of state forensic laboratory experts,â€� he added.

The Howrah district police authority carried out a quick inquiry to see how many buses had sealed emergency gates. To their horror, they noticed â€œin an overwhelming majority of buses, not less that 75 per cent in short and long distance buses, had their emergency gates sealed,â€� a DSP revealed.

To their enquiry why the public vehicle department rule was being violated, police faced a strange reason from the bus operators.

â€œThey actually sealed the gate to avert further accident,â€� bus operators argued to the police. Some said that mishaps have occurred after some passengers slipped through the gate which accidentally opened up.

1,Alliance Air to increase N-E flight frequency,"GUWAHATI: Alliance Air, which recently launched its ATR-42 service in the North Eastern region, is all set to increase its frequency and introduce new flights by the end of next March.

The airlines'' managing director, Monet Paes, told reporters that the new flights were aimed at improving air connectivity in the region.

Flights would be run between Guwahati and Aizawl while a direct air link between Kolkata and Shillong would be launched by February 15, Paes said.

Alliance Air, a wholly owned subsidiary of Indian Airlines, launched the operation of ATR-42 aircraft on the Kolkata-Guwahati-Dimapur-Agartala sectors from December 25 next, he said.

The ATR services were launched with aid from the North-Eastern Council which pledged to provide Rs 35 crore every year for the next three years, he said.

Even though there would be an annual loss of Rs 38 crore for Alliance in the ATR service, the flights would continue as an endeavour to help people living in remote areas, Paes said.

Paes said it was further proposed to introduce daily flights between Kolkata-Dimapur as well as between Aizawl, Agartala, Lilabari and Guwahati.

By the end of next month, Paes said, all the four ATR aircraft would be put on operation, thus doubling the capacity from the existing 2125 seats per week to 4177 seats in the region.

Besides increase in frequency and consequent seat capacity, new routes would also be opened and the endeavour would be to connect all state capitals of the seven North Eastern states, he said.
