3,Man declared untraceable a year after arrest,"new delhi: a hyderabad-based car dealer, who was arrested in connection with a car theft racket, has been declared a proclaimed offender although he has been attending court hearings in delhi since march 2000. a proclaimed offender is an accused who is untraceable. arrested by the east district police in 2000, vijay kumar was allegedly involved in 42 cases of car theft. in november 2000, kumar was released on bail by which time he had been discharged in 28 cases of theft after the court failed to find any evidence against him. subsequent to his release, he was discharged in three more cases but faced similar allegations in three new cases. one of them was a case of car theft registered at the lahori gate police station on february 4, 2001. the complainant stated that he had learnt about the recovery of his car from a resident of hyderabad, anand reddy, who had reportedly purchased the car from kumar. the complainant was, however, not the owner of the car when it was reportedly stolen. he also admitted that he had not informed the then owner of the car and got the car transferred to his name six months after the alleged theft. four months after registering the case, the lahori gate police sought the court's permission to declare kumar a proclaimed offender despite the fact that kumar had been coming to delhi to attend court hearings.

4,Advocates slam govt on tenancy act,"kolkata: senior advocates in kolkata on thursday came down heavily on the west bengal premises tenancy act 1997, which they said, had not only curtailed the power of the judiciary for disposing tenancy related litigations but also violated the constitution by giving the same power to the administration. in a press conference, bar council of west bengal convenor amiya kumar chatterjee criticising the act , said the cases arising out of disputes between the landlord and the tenant which were earlier dealt with the civil courts will now on be dealt with a tribunal consisting of members from the indian administrative service or west bengal civil service. chaterjee said that since such administrative persons are preoccupied with different administrative work, there is every chance that litigations might not be disposed of quickly. members said that by transferring the power from the judiciary to the executive, there has been an open violation of the directive principles of state policy which says that the executive and the judiciary should be seperate entities. they said that although tribunals like these take only a short span for disposing of cases at the initial stage, later on such cases get delayed. they said that they will organise a protest rally at rani rashmoni road on september 18 to protest against the act. in a seminar on the wbpta, 1997 organised at the merchants' chamber of commerce, senior advocate of calcutta high court p.k.mallick said that the act had taken away the right to appeal to the high court which was there in the earlier act of 1956. ""the right for appeal which is there in article 226 has been taken away by section 43 and 44 of the act"", he said. he said that it will be a huge financial burden in appointing a large number of controllers required for disposing of litigations. he said it will be a gross injustice on the part of the litigant if the tribunals remain vaccant and there is no one to dispose litigations. advocate general of tripura bikash ranjan bhattacharjee however said that disposing of litigations through tribunals is a positive step because the present legal system takes a prolonged time for disposing of such cases. he said that the new act imposes certain obligations both for the tenants and landlords. for example, it makes it statutory for the landlord to issue receipt to the tenant. similarly it makes it obligatory for the tenant to pay the rent. both of them might be penalised if they do not abide by these statutes.

15,"Farmer suicides mount, but where is the relief?","hubli: with 25-year-old virupaksha sannairappa beesarahalli succumbing to death on friday, one more statistic has been added to the long list of reported suicides by members of the farming community in dharwad district. till now, 22 farmers have reportedly ended their lives in dharwad district over the past seven months. virupaksha of hulambi village of kalghatgi taluka, had in distress consumed pesticide and was rushed to kims hospital in hubli, where he was declared dead. according to the residents of hullambi, virupaksha's family owned 7 acres of land and had cultivated 6 acres, of which 5 acres had paddy and one cotton. the failure of the monsoon resulted in virupaksha taking the ultimate step. ""he had borrowed loans from various agencies, but when he found himself unable to repay them, he decided to kill himself,"" said a relative of the deceased. it is a known fact that farmers borrow huge loans at exorbitant rates of interest. the spurt in suicides in dharwad district is directly linked to the crash in the prices of agricultural produce. the drought has made the situation worse. the first suicide was reported in navalur village near hubli, when a potato grower killed himself. this saw an army of politicians of different colours, including former prime minister deve gowda and former minister p.g.r. sindhia rushing to the village to express their sympathies with the bereaved family. after this, the state government announced rs 1 lakh as compensation. then another farmer from gamanagatti near hubli ended his life and the government also compensated the family. however, the suicide cases reported after these two incidents did not come into focus as the government decided to institute a ministerial enquiry into the deaths before compensating. with severe drought gripping the region, the district administration is at loss to check this suicide phenomenon. the opposition wants the government to postpone the repaying schedule of the loans taken from nationalised banks. but what is worrying is that a majority of the farmers are indebted to private financiers in their villages and middlemen from the cities. the drought relief work is focused on providing work for the dislocated farming community and also providing fodder to the cattle and drinking water. sources in the revenue department pointed out that the relief measures will at best help farmers earn their daily bread. but, what about the repayment of the loans? this is what haunts the farmers in distress.
