0,Delhi frames rules to deal with SARS cases,"NEW DELHI: The Delhi government is planning to make the killer flu a notifiable disease. Sources said on Thursday that the proposal has been ""processed"" and only a final gazette notification is awaited. Officials said the other states were still considering taking such a measure.

Once SARS becomes notifiable, doctors will have to report all cases that they suspect as SARS to the municipal authorities. Health officials said this will help in ""curtailing transmission as well as keeping a specific area under surveillance"".

""This is basically to give proper medical advice to patients and make it mandatory for medical practitioners to refer the patient to the right hospital. The practitioner will also be required to find out the contacts that the infected person may have had during this period,"" the sources said.

The Delhi government had made dengue a notifiable disease during an epidemic in 1996. Diseases that can be transmitted easily are usually put on this list. Smallpox, chicken pox and plague have been on the notifiable list in the country.

Once declared a notifiable disease, doctors will have to follow the definition of the WHO while identifying the suspected SARS cases.

This means that any person with a sudden onset of high fever, cough or difficulty in breathing and a history of recent travel to a SARS-affected country or close contact with an infected person, will have to be reported to the authorities.

1,Cycle rally: SP punishes defaulters,"LUCKNOW: The Samajwadi Party has decided to remove all such office-bearers who have shown no inclination towards participating in the cycle rally.

Announcing this at a press conference on Thursday, state president Ram Sharan Das said reports had been received from certain quarters that some office-bearers were showing no interest in the cycle rally which began on April 19. Accordingly, it had been decided to divest such people of their posts, he said.

Das also said that it was his party''s demand that a privilege motion be moved against chief minister Mayawati for calling the MPs manuwadi. He said by doing so the CM had not only insulted the MPs, but also the entire country.

Referring to the imposition of the Gangsters Act on Mamta Tewari, Das said she was being falsely implicated. Her father Dharmanand Tewari was an old member of the party, he added. Tewari who was also present at the press conference stated that his daughter was being wrongly implicated allegedly at the behest of a BJP MLC.

2,"Monitor drought scene directly, ministers told","GANDHINAGAR: Concerned with intensifying drought situation in Gujarat, Chief Minister Narendra Modi asked his Cabinet colleagues on Wednesday to start monitoring the ground-level reality directly. Till now, only senior IAS bureaucrats were doing the job, with each one having been given a group of talukas.

Modi said at the Cabinet meeting, held after the lapse of a fortnight, that ministers should start taking surprise visits to ensure that the administration was well-geared to take care of the drought.

The CM''s instructions came even as top leaders in the BJP have started feeling uneasy about the government undermining the severity of drought in several areas of North Gujarat, Kutch and Saurashtra. MLAs and senior leaders have complained to ministers that the state has â€˜underestimated the number of villagesâ€™, said a top insider. While the state declared 6,021 villages belonging to 115 talukas of 14 districts as drought-affected, â€˜the real figure should have been nearly 10,000.â€™

BJP sources allege that instructions were issued from the top in Gandhinagar not to include â€˜too many villages as drought-affectedâ€™. As a result, there is acute scarcity of fodder and increasing complaints of animal deaths as also instances of hunger among the workers at relief sites. The Cabinet admitted that the truckers'' strike had affected the movement of essential commodities to the scarcityhit areas. It appealed to the truckers to â€˜cooperateâ€™ at least for carrying fodder and food items to their destination.

Even as seeking to distance from the criticism being levelled by BJP insiders about undermining the drought intensity, the Cabinet admitted that a â€˜drought crisisâ€™ had emerged and it was necessary to take â€˜all necessary steps to fight it so as to help the affected people by providing relief jobs, fodder and drinking water urgently.â€™

Cabinet spokesperson IK Jadeja told newspersons, â€œAlready, 7.29 lakh workers were getting relief at the sites in the affected villages.â€�

Jadeja said the state had so far spent Rs 181.37 crore on drought out of a total of Rs 900 crore drought-relief plan.

Of this, Rs 54.81 crore went as wages to relief workers, Rs 6.21 crore as cash doles to the vulnerable sections of the population that could not work at the relief camps and Rs 12.84 crore as subsidy to the cattle camps. This apart, as many as 1,657 villages were being supplied water by 1,205 tankers. Yet, he insisted, this year''s drought intensity was â€˜less than that of 1999-2000.â€™

He denied reports that above 700 cattle had died in Sabarkantha on account of drought. â€œNot one cattle has perished. This is humbug. Just as there is mortality rate for human beings, there is one for animals, too.One does not notice any sharp rise in the rate of death among amimals.

It remains between 2.5 to 3.5 per cent, depending on different areas as in the past. I have not received any case of people going hungry on account of drought,â€� he said.

3,Gujarat's varsities jittery as govt cuts block grants,"VADODARA/AHMEDABAD: An official note of the state government, informing five universities that they will receive less money in their monthly block grants, has sent shock waves in academic circles. The grants of these universities have been reduced by varying amounts, ranging between about 7 per cent to 37 per cent.

Bhavnagar University has been the worst-hit, facing a cut of 37.3 per cent, followed by Gujarat University at around 33.9 per cent. Sardar Patel University of Vallabh Vidyanagar and Maharaja Sayajirao University of Vadodara come in third with both facing a 25.1 per cent cut. Saurashtra University will face a meagre cut of 7.1 per cent.

Gujarat University vicechancellor A U Patel said they are receiving Rs 41 lakh less from the total grant of Rs 13 crore. â€œThis cut is not going to affect the daily functioning of the university as we have resources to make payments like salaries,â€� he said. Patel added, â€œBut it will definitely affect the future development of the university.

Some development plans will have to be held back.â€� Commissioner of higher education Rajiv Gupta however insisted they had not reduced the grants of any universities. â€œIt is just that not all expenditures that they show are admissible according to government and finance department norms and that affects allocation of funds.â€�

Sources in the MSU here pointed out that their budgetary allocations for the current financial year would go haywire if the said â€˜cutâ€™ was implemented. â€œWe might be able to manage things in the short term. However, it might get difficult in the long run,â€� said MSU chief accounts officer (CAO) N N Shah.

Officials added that with a bulk of the universityâ€™s salary bill relying on the block grant, it would become difficult to manage things. â€œAs much as 90 per cent of the universityâ€™s finances, especially establishment expenditure, relies on the grant. The university will have to cut corners and make other arrangements to take care of finances,â€� said a senior official.

MSU vice-chancellor K C Upadhyay said that it was true that there was a reduction in the grant. â€œWe have already asked the accounts department to prepare a detailed analysis of the effects of the cut and find out ways to deal with it. The complete picture will become clear only after the details are ascertained on how the impact of the cut has hit us,â€� he said.

Sources in the education department, however, privately admit that cutting grants is an arm-twisting exercise to force universities to become more financially prudent. â€œSome of the universities have not given their utilisation certificates for six to seven years,â€� an official told TNN under condition of anonymity. â€œHow can we issue new grant to them if we donâ€™t know how they have spent the money allotted earlier?â€� M S University officials, however, say it is not their fault if government auditors come only once in three years.

When the Joint Board of Vice-Chancellors met state education minister Anandiben Patel recently, they were told to bring in more financial discipline in their universities. As a first step, a common accounting software and a common standard code of accounting has been suggested to bring in more uniformity between universities.

4,PIL on 'lathi' rally dismissed,"PATNA: The Patna High Court on Thursday dismissed a PIL seeking a ban on RJDâ€™s â€œlathiâ€� rally to be held on April 30. The PIL had been filed by the state unit of PUCL, apprehending law and order problems during the rally.

Hearing the PIL, a division bench comprising Chief Justice R S Dhavan and Justice R N Prasad observed, â€œOf actions and reactions between rallies and counter-rallies, it all depends which one suits whom. The high court is not an arbitrator in politics.â€� Neither is it a proper forum for getting a cure for all the ills and problems, the court added.

The judges said maintenance of law and order was the concern of the state government.

Pointing out that ills are not formed or cured instantly, the court said: â€œWe leave it to the conscience of the people to save democracy and find out a cure for all prevailing ills of society and politics. The court does not possess a magic wand to cure all prevailing ills,â€� the bench said.

The bench said there are a number of cases of public interest pending in the high court in which the petitioners have never shown any interest.

It directed the petitionersâ€™ counsel Ebrahim Kabir to ask his clients to show interest in those PILs pending in the court so that they can be disposed of quickly and peopleâ€™s grievances are redressed.

The bench expressed its annoyance over the PUCL PIL being highlighted through the print and electronic media prior to the filing of case in the court. The PIL was filed on Wednesday afternoon after rectification of its defects.

Petitioners Kishori Das and Lakshmi Sahu stated in the PIL that since 10 lakh to one crore people are expected to participate in the April 30 rally with their well-oiled lathis, it would endanger the life and property of 20 lakh residents of Patna and so the rally should not be allowed. â€œSuch a rally is absolutely not permissible under the Constitution,â€� the petition said.

5,IG PAC conducts probe into Ayodhya violence,"LUCKNOW: Close on the heels of the interim report by the additional director general of police (ADG) PAC on the violence by some PAC jawans in Ayodhya recently, Inspector General of Police (IG) PAC Shailja Kant Misra was sent to Faizabad on Tuesday to conduct a comprehensive inquiry into the happenings at Ayodhya and submit a detailed report.

This happened after the ADGâ€™s report was termed as incomplete by various agencies in Ayodhya whose role was put under scanner with regards to their acts during the violence. One of the main contentions was that the interim report of the ADG did not mention anything on the alleged plans of the irate PAC personnel to throng the sanctum sanctorum at the peak of violence.

It was pointed out that the DIG Faizabad range K N D Dwivedi himself had cited this before the ADG when the statements of the former were being recorded during the interim probe.

However, after plan of the PAC jawans to throng the place where idols of gods were kept was published in this newspaper, a top official of the state home department crossed checked the details with the Faizabad authorities. It was after this fact was established that the state government decided to get a detailed inquiry conducted into the incident by the IG PAC.

Though Misra returned to the state capital on Thursday, he remained beyond the reach of the media till late in the night. On the other hand, reports from Faizabad said that the IG recorded detailed statements of more than 50 persons during his two-day stay at the temple town.

Among these were commissioner and DIG, DM and SSP of Faizabad, SP City, ADM City, CO City, SO Ram Janam Bhoomi Complex, sub-inspector who got the post mortem done and the SI who is investigating the cases lodged in connection with the violence.

The IG also verified the wireless messages logged with the police control room in Faizabad during the time violence was at its peak. He recorded statements of government officials who were present at the time of violence.

Sources said that many officials who were on leave and were not available in the town, have been summoned to get their statements recorded later on. The IG was expected to file his report within the next one week after recording of statments was completed.

6,"Protests over random arrests, Pota","AHMEDABAD: Agitated about the random arrests of members of their community and the imposition of Pota on some of them, post the Haren Pandya murder, the minority community has taken up the matter with its leaders to take necessary action.

The Jamaat-e-Islam-e-Hind (JIH) is one of the organisations which is expected to take up the matter soon and is likely to be joined in by several other Muslim leaders from Delhi, said sources. On Thursday, AMC corporator Nazneen Bastawala headed a womenâ€™s delegation of the community to present its case before the Ahmedabad police officers about the random arrests.

Bastawala told TNN: â€œInnocent people are being nabbed, illegally detained for days and being subjected to unfair interrogation by the crime branch officials. Such has been the impact of this heavy handed approach that areas like Kalupur look like a curfew bound locality soon after sundown. Each minority family in the city now live in fear of who would be the next victim.â€�

Said a member of the community, â€œOur people are most agitated at the fact that some of them are picked up in the dead of night on the pretext that their statements have to be recorded and then there is no sign of them for 24 hours.â€�

The imposition of Pota has caused further anguish, this member added. Bastawala added: â€œHow legal is it to impose Pota on some accused who have done nothing anti-national. We took up this matter with the CP and will also take legal opinion on this subject.â€�

Clarion calls for the community to unite against these developments were reportedly made in the areas of Kalupur and Dariapur and police sources admit that there have been some meetings to deliberate over the issue.

A resident of Kalupur Darwaja area whose son has been missing since past two days spoke on condition of anonymity: â€œLaw has become one-sided and being a Muslim seems to be criminal.

Without any reason people are arbitrarily picked up and detained illegally by the law enforcers themselves. Speaking out against this torture makes matters only worse.â€�

When contacted, a JIH member Mohammad Shafi Madni said, â€œWe have not yet charted out our plans for action but I shall be coming to Ahmedabad on Saturday to discuss the nitty-grittiesâ€�.

According to sources, â€œmost of the cases turned out to be of mistaken identities where people were picked up just because they had the same names as the accused!â€� one Tinu Chakku Meldi of having led a mob of about 200 people to attack their cars

7,"Will Maya uphold law, sack Amar Mani?","LUCKNOW: Former chief minister Rajnath Singh had sacked the controversial minister Amar Mani Tripathi from his cabinet without wasting time once the Special Task Force (STF) found him involved in harbouring criminals on December 12, 2001.

Tripathi now stands indicted in another case and it is now time for chief minister Mayawati to act and show her commitment for establishing the rule of law in the state.

Tripathi, presently minister of state for government printing presses, has been ordered by the Allahabad High Court to hand over the possession of a house, forcibly grabbed by him in 1999 in Gorakhpur, back to its bonafide owner Shivpati Devi and also pay her a compensation of Rs 1 lakh for the harassement caused to her.

However, the minister on Thursday remained elusive. Persistent calls made to his office and residence for his comment did not evoke any response as he was stated to be ""untraceable"". While the Samajwadi Party found the court ruling as a strong enough reason for him to be sacked, the BJP played it safe. The state BJP chief Vinay Katiyar said: ""Nobody is above the law and the court verdict should be honoured"". When asked as to whether he would demand his resignation, he quipped: ""It is for the CM to decide as I cannot comment on it without seeing the court ruling.""

A senior officer in the CMâ€™s secretariat said: ""Law should take its own course."" But he then hurriedly asked, what was so adverse in the court ruling? When asked to comment on the issue in Delhi, former secretary general of the Lok Sabha, Subhash Kashyap said: ""The judgement cannot be construed as a constitutional impropriety on part of the minister and as for morality it is a subjective judgement of individual or party or organisation, which he or she belongs to.""

And with the BSP out to reward ministerial berths to defectors and making the party as a stop for all sorts of elements, the moral issue is unlikely to prick the chief minister or the minister. But what is more serious is the observation of Justice M Katju and Justice RS Tripathi who in their verdict on Wednesday had said that Tripathi had abused his power as a minister to occupy the property. The court also directed the district magistrate and senior superintendent of police, Gorakhpur, to ensure the restoration of the house in question to Shivpati.

Shivpati had alleged in her petition that she had been in lawful possession of the house since 1994 before the minister and his younger brother Ajit Mani Tripathi and Yudhishtir Dubey forcibly evicted her by getting the land declared as free hold.

Incidentally, the minister and his brother were also involved in another case of land grabbing in which also the Allahabad High Court had on April 21 directed the district administration of Gorakhpur to ensure transfer of the prime land to its legal owner. The court had set a deadline of a week which is to end on April 27.

8,Lathi rally ridiculous: Mahajan,"PATNA: BJP general-secretary Pramod Mahajan on Thursday lashed out against RJD chief Laloo Yadav for brandishing oil-soaked lathis while exhorting people across the state to attend the â€œBJP bhagao, desh bachao maharaillaâ€� of the RJD in Patna on April 30.

It does not behove a ruling party chief to brandish lathis at public places himself while asking his supporters to reach the rally venue carrying lathis, Mahajan said.

Describing the proposed RJD rally as ridiculous, Mahajan said that Laloo was seeking to divert the attention of the people from the failure of the Rabri Devi government on various fronts including development and law and order by organising a lathi rally.

Mahajan said that the rally was symbolic of the violent mind of the RJD, adding that instead of finding solutions to the problems facing the state, Laloo was indulging in political gimmick. It was evident from the fact that Laloo was seeking to drive away US president Bush by brandishing lathis in Patna. Even Russia, Germany, France and China could not do it, Mahajan quipped while talking to reporters.

Replying to a query, Mahajan said that although the lathi was not a firearm yet injury by it could prove fatal. When his attention was drawn towards the â€œtrishulâ€� training programme launched by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), Mahajan said that the BJP had nothing to do with this programme. He, however, justified the VHP programme saying the latter was a cultural organisation.

Mahajan, who was here to flag off the Veer Kuer Singh memorial long distance run competition, also held discussions with senior BJP leaders of Bihar at the residence of leader of opposition in the state legislative council Ganga Prasad on the political situation in Bihar.

â€œWe discussed ways to improve the performance of the party in Bihar,â€� Mahajan said. Union minister C P Thakur, Leader of the opposition in the state assembly Sushil Kumar Modi and BJP state vice-president Kiran Ghai were also present at the press conference.

9,BJP to go it alone in Assembly polls: Mahajan,"PATNA: BJP general secretary Pramod Mahajan said here on Thursday that the Assembly elections in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Delhi due in October/November would the last trial of strength between the BJP and the Congress before the Lok Sabha (LS) polls next year.

Predicting a landslide victory for the BJP in all the four states, Mahajan said there would be a straight contest between the BJP and the Congress in the assembly elections. Talking to mediapersons at the state BJP headquarters, Mahajan said his party would not enter into an alliance with any other political party in the assembly elections in the four states.

He said the people of the four states want change since the Congress has been ruling Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh for the last 10 years and Rajasthan and Delhi for the last five years. Both the BJP and the Congress have strong bases in the four states, he added.

Mahajan made it absolutely clear that Atal Bihari Vajpayee would be the prime ministerial candidate of the NDA in the next LS elections as well. He said Vajpayee would be taking oath as Prime Minister for the fourth consecutive time if the NDA retains power in the next LS polls. Even Indira Gandhi could not achieve this feat, he maintained, adding that Vajpayee has already become the first non-Congress Prime Minister to have completed five years in office.

Requesting opposition parties, including the Congress, to support the two proposed Constitution amendments Bills to stop defections besides limiting the size of a ministry to 10 per cent of the total strength of the House concerned, Mahajan said these Bills are aimed at bringing about political reforms in the country.

He said the anti-defection law enacted during the regime of Rajiv Gandhi has proved to be totally ineffective as not a single member of any political party has lost their seat either in a state assembly or in the LS during the last 20 years for violating the law. In fact, there are instances when defectors have been made ministers, he added.

Replying to a query, the BJP leader said the opposition parties would get enough opportunity to put across their points of view on the Constitution amendment Bills when they are placed before the standing committees of Parliament. The standing committees have members from all political parties. Any attempt to seek political consensus on the Bills before they are moved in Parliament would have delayed the process of political reforms. Every political party stands to gain once the Bills are passed by both the Houses of Parliament. The Bills need to be passed separately by both the Houses, he observed.

Replying to another query, Mahajan indicated that the BJP is not happy with the way UP chief minister Mayawati has instituted 150 cases against Samajwadi Party (SP) leader Mulayam Singh Yadav and others. In a parliamentary democracy, things should not be done in this manner. There should be some code of conduct for a ruling party in such matters, he said.

Mahajan, however, severely criticised the SP for releasing the CDs of Mayawatiâ€™s speeches at the Bahujan Samaj Partyâ€™s closed-door meetings.

Mahajan said the BJP is yet to assess if it has gained politically by supporting the Mayawati government in UP. He refused to comment on the internal bickerings in the Samata Party.

10,Jagtap arrested for cheating,"PUNE: Crime branch sleuths on Thursday arrested Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) corporator Nitin Jagtap after additional sessions judge B.V. Borikar denied anticipatory bail to him.

The Chatushrungi police had recently registered an offence of cheating against Jagtap (44), a resident of Model colony, and one Prakash Gole (54) of Janwadi.

The action was taken following a complaint by one Ashish Agarwal (25) of Indur that the duo took Rs 50,000 each from him, promising him admission to the master of personnel management course offered by the Symbiosis law college in the year 2002.

The police said the duo neither secured admission for Ashish, nor did they return him the money. Jagtap and Gole, a clerk at the college, were booked under Sections 420 and 507 of the IPC.

On Monday, the duo filed an application for an anticipatory bail in the court of Borikar and was granted an inter-anticipatory bail.

Borikar, however, told them to be present in the court on Wednesday.

The public prosecutor argued that the police wanted to recover Agarwal''s money. He said the police were in possession of a tape of conversation between Agarwal, Jagtap and Gole and sought the court''s permission to interrogate the duo.

Accepting the prosecution''s argument, Borikar rejected anticipatory bail to Jagtap and Gole. Interestingly, Jagtap had announced to commit suicide on Saturday when chief minister Sushilkumar Shinde goes to Solapur to file nomination papers for a by-election.

11,TDP suspends 5 more partymen,"HYDERABAD: Taking a tough stand on internal squabbles, the Telugu Desam Party on Thursday suspended five partymen, even as the final day of the organisational elections went off peacefully across the state, barring minor incidents in a few places.

12,Pramod Mahajan cosies up to Sena as polls loom large,"MUMBAI: All-India BJP general secretary Pramod Mahajanâ€™s recent talks with key Shiv Sena leaders are an indication that the crusty BJP strategist is ready to play Javed to Sena chief Bal Thackerayâ€™s Salim and script the Sena-BJP combineâ€™s soapopera for the state assembly elections.

After keeping the Thackerays at bay for nearly two years, Mr Mahajan held discussions with Sena bigwigs, including Lok Sabha speaker Manohar Joshi, Uddhav Thackeray, Raj Thackeray and Narayan Rane, among others on a sultry April afternoon last Sunday.

Toasted in 1995 as the author of the Sena-BJPâ€™s poll victory which humbled the Congress in Maharashtra, Mr Mahajan, during the last two years, maintained a studied silence on the BJPâ€™s â€˜kabhie saas, kabhie bahuâ€™ ties with the Sena.

A Sena leader, however, claimed, â€œThere is no truth that Mr Mahajan has kept the Sena at a distance. In fact, he has always been monitoring the heartbeats of the Sena-BJP combine in the state.â€™â€™

On Sunday, Mr Mahajan was joined by his senior party colleagues, including Gopinath Munde, Pandurang Phundkar and Vinod Tawde. The meeting, which was held at the mayorâ€™s Shivaji Park residence, deliberated on the poll strategy ahead of the state assembly elections.

The meeting assumes significance in view of Maharashtra chief minister Sushilkumar Shindeâ€™s recent announcement which strongly suggested that the state assembly elections, which are scheduled for next year,may be â€œround the cornerâ€™â€™.

The Congress Party and the Sharad Pawarled NCP have handpicked new headsâ€”Mr Gurudas Kamat and Mr Sachin Ahir, respectively â€”for their Mumbai units in a signal that the ruling Democratic Front partners are all set to revamp their organisational units in view of early elections.

â€œThe assembly elections are scheduled for 2004. However, if they are held earlier we are fully prepared to face them,â€™â€™ BJP spokesperson Prakash Javdekar told mediapersons after the meeting.

The saffron allianceâ€™s theme for assembly elections will be discussed at length at a daylong conclave of Sena-BJP MPs, MLAs and senior functionaries in Mumbai on April 26. Mr Bal Thackeray and Mr Mahajan, among others, will address the conclave.

The saffron combine is planning to step up its crusade against the ruling DF alliance.Mr Gopinath Mundeâ€™s â€˜sangharsha-yatraâ€™ and Mr Uddhav Thackerayâ€™s â€˜chaalte vhaaâ€™ (Get Out) agitation have set the mood for the saffron siblingsâ€™ anti-DF campaign.

Referring to the alteration of the constituency delimitation bill to be based on the 2001 census, he said the BJP and the Congress would have to come to a consensus on the issue.

Venugopalachary said the TDP also favoured the bill to limit ministries to 10 per cent of the total strength both at the Centre and the states.

He added that the Union government should call for an all-party meet and the chief ministers of all states to discuss the issue.

14,Helmet rule fires hands-free sets sale,"HYDERABAD: As the deadline for the helmet rule, May 1, draws closer, it is the turn of manufacturers and retailers of hands-free sets for mobile phones to see a surge in business. Helmet retailers are witnessing a boom in sales.

Though the use of mobile phones while driving is prohibited, the number of such users has not come down significantly, and several two-wheeler riders can be seen juggling between an active mobile phone and the handlebar of their vehicle in the city.

After the helmet rule comes into force, use of mobile phones during travel will become more difficult.

Taking note of this, retailers of mobile phone handsets are procuring stocks of hands-free sets. The price of such sets ranges between Rs 100 and Rs 500, depending on the brand. Some retailers are claiming they have a stock of hands-free sets which are designed for helmet users.

The proprietor of K B N Enterprises at Khan Lateef Khan Estates, Ilyas, said a month ago he used to sell 5-10 sets a day. ""But these days there is a huge demand and I am selling 40-50 sets a day. Hoping that the demand will further go up, I have brought a huge stock,"" he said.

M M Kafil of ATM Marketing Associates, near L B Stadium, said he never expected such a response from the public and claimed sales have gone up four-fold. ""People are not only preferring hands-free sets, but many of them are particular about the brand,"" he added.

B Narayana Goud, an engineer with the DRDL, Kanchanbagh, says when he uses a hands-free set, he is comfortable having a lengthy conversation while driving. P Manjusree, a mechanical engineer who stays at NGOs Colony, said, ""I never preferred hands-free sets before I began using a helmet, but my helmet has left me no option but to buy the set.""

15,State govt portal gets a 'facelift',"HYDERABAD: Chief minister Chandrababu Naidu''s government has silently put on a new facade on the Internet. The new face of the tech-savvy government went unnoticed for a year now, a clear indication that the state didn''t want any publicity.

The new improved and updated website, www.aponline.gov.in, launched in 2002, is an entry point to websites of all government departments and other Andhra Pradesh-related sites.

The government''s earlier portal, www.andhrapradesh.com, has been consigned to the archives of the information technology history. It had an array of features to attract an avid Net surfer. But things are not the same at the new URL.

An official of the IT&C department, speaking on condition of anonymity, said, ""The chief minister, known for wiring the government from top to bottom to make all arms of the administration visible, accessible and usable through the Internet, may find it hard to realise his dreams if he fails to improve and promote the new face.''''

""Public documents that ought to be accessible to everyone are nowhere in sight. In fact, the site which has been designed as a ''tool of propaganda'' seriously falls short of many requirement. It is absolutely a non-effective website,"" CPM secretary B V Raghavulu said.

Portal Player managing director J A Choudary said the portal through continuous maintenance and interactive web services could reach out to more people. ""It is a very well-designed portal keeping in view the rapid strides in e-governance,"" he said.

Special officer of the AP portal, N V J Raju, said a host of changes were in the offing. ""We are waiting for the approval of the chief minister,"" he added.

V Bhanu, a young entrepreneur, said the new website was only good to look at. The focus should have been on avenues for investment and business opportunities in the state, he added.

""I don''t find the website encouraging. All talk of computer literacy and endeavours of Naidu are a waste if the new face does not interest the surfer,"" quips Internet freak M Vyshnav Kumar.

19,Mamata aide attempts suicide,"KOLKATA: Trinamul Congress MLA and party chief Mamata Banerjee''s close confidante, Sonali Guha, was admitted to a city nursing home on Thursday afternoon after she swallowed 40 sleeping pills in a span of 12 hours. Relatives broke open the door of Guha''s bedroom and rushed her to the nursing home.

Guha has been put on saline drip and is also being administered oxygen occasionally. However, doctors said she was out of danger.

Guha said in the evening she attempted suicide because her husband Partho Bose was denied the post of chairman of borough V of KMC. Instead, sitting borough chairperson Pratima Mondol was re-elected to the post by Trinamul and BJP councillors.

Guha, however, blamed KMC mayor-in-council member Pradip Ghosh for her husband''s defeat. ""I could not bear the manner in which I was insulted on Wednesday. They used filthy language against me and Didi (Mamata). I could not bear it and so I took 40 pills,"" a weeping Guha said. ""Didi wanted Partho to be the new chairman. But Ghosh will not listen to any one. He even dared to tell me that I wash Didi''s clothes to please her.""

Denying the charges, Ghosh claimed that Mondol was a unanimous choice for the post. ""We have five Trinamul and one BJP councillor in the borough. All of them voted for Mondol and this includes Partho himself,"" he said. ""Why is Sonali blaming me?"" However, senior Trinamul leaders remained tightlipped on the issue and even thought it prudent to stay away from the nursing home. According to sources, Ghosh, who is MMIC slum development and once a confidant of state Congress leader Somen Mitra, had bluntly ruled out Mamata''s suggestion that Mondol be replaced by Partho as the borough committee chairman.

Things come to a head on Wednesday, the day Mondol was re-elected, when Guha reportedly exchanged blows with Ghosh''s supporters. Both Guha and her husband threatened to resign from the party unless Ghosh and Mondol were expelled from the Trinamul. ""I have reported the entire episode to Didi. But I doubt whether she is capable of taking any action. Unless these two are expelled, we will have to resign,"" Guha said. In a written statement to the police, Guha alleged that Ghosh had provoked her to commit suicide.

20,'Stop farmers from migrating to cities',"BANGALORE: Farmers must be introduced to agricultural reforms to prevent them from switching over to cash crops from traditional crops and they should be stopped from migrating to urban areas, was the sentiment voiced by experts during the Conference on National Unity and Economic Development organised by the Global Economic Council on Thursday.

Present on the occasion were governor T.N. Chaturvedi, former governor of Tamil Nadu and Assam Bhishma Narayan Singh, mayor C.M. Nagaraj and minister of child and social welfare department C. Motamma.

The conference addressed problems on economic development and industrial developmental programmes and also brought out the point that the countryâ€™s strength lies in its economic strength and resources.

Highlighting the need for democratic consensus among parties, consistency in policy and the need to work together, Chaturvedi added, â€œNational unity will express itself in various groups and communities for India is a vast country.

21,Fire minister admits failure to book wealthy promoters,"KOLKATA: State fire services minister Pratim Chatterjee said on Thursday that he had little or no hope at all that well-connected promoters and builders, who were either accused of wilful negligence or suspected of causing fire for profit,would ever be booked.

""I have failed to book the owner of an electronic goods showroom at Ultadanga in a similar case of criminal negligence. Police do not want to arrest moneyed people,"" he claimed.

After dousing the fire at the underground Satyanarayan AC Market with great difficulty on Thursday morning, the fire services department has decided to file a case of criminal negligence against the promoter and lessee of the market, Pawan Kajaria.

Announcing this, Chatterjee said though the market had an in-built fire-fighting system, including fire alarms, lack of maintenance had made it dysfunctional. His department secretary R.K. Prasannan said the sprinkler watering system, installed at the market, had to be repaired and re-activated by the fire brigade.

""This is failure on the part of the lessee of the market and violation of the conditions for the sanction of our permission for building the underground market,"" added Prasannan. According to him, the original owner of the market, Kolkata Municipal Corporation, was not responsible for the fire and the lessee should be blamed.

Prasannan admitted that no FIR had been lodged by his department. Though he had no clue about the source of the devastating fire, he ruled out any sabotage. The fire, which had raged for about 60 hours,was finally tamed by the fire brigade and the KMC by flooding the underground floors. ""It was our men who have accomplished it despite our initial failure due to the inexperience of dealing with an underground fire,"" said Chatterjee.

Though fire experts from Coal India and CISF had arrived, added Chatterjee, they pleaded helplessness at seeing the tremendous heat. Fortunately, the structure of the building was not damaged by the fire, he claimed.

The government has decided to form an expert committee with a structural engineer, architect and a fire expert to draw fire-safety guidelines for underground markets and auditoriums.

22,Brave woman rues lawlessness in city,"KOLKATA: Even after showing courage, one may find it difficult to come out with the truth, particularly if she is a woman. Gayatri Mishra of Salt Lake learnt it the hard way.

On Thursday, Mishra received the Officerâ€™s Choice Gallantry Award instituted by BDA Ltd. Sanjit Das,who was killed after protesting against eve-teasing on a crowded bus in the North 24-Parganas and Falguni Chatterjee who tried to save two children from being run over by a train, were also awarded posthumously.

The awards were given away by Sourav Ganguly.

But Gayatri confessed that she was afraid to identify the miscreant who had attacked her with a revolver. The man was caught following a valiant effort by Gayatri, despite being shot in her forearm.

The incident took place in February last year at HB block in Salt Lake when Gayatri was walking with her son back from school. She grabbed the armed miscreant and did not let him go even after he fired at her. The locals finally caught him and handed him over to the police.

â€œBut when the police contacted me, I did not have the courage to identify the person as I knew that the police would not provide me any security. I also received various indirect threats and decided not to report anything. After all, I have kids and have to think about them as well,â€� she said.

She was candid about the fear that existed around her. â€œI came here 20 years ago and over the years, I feel that the situation has deteriorated. Now everyone takes out firearms. Individuals operate more than gangs, which used to be otherwise even 10 years ago,â€� she said.

23,Nothing good can happen under NDA govt: Sonia,"BHOPAL: Congress President Sonia Gandhi on Friday said unless the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre was removed from office nothing good can happen in the country.

""Under this government, unemployment is increasing even as there is a steep rise in prices and corruption,"" Sonia said in her address at a massive Madhya Pradesh-level ''cooperative convention'' at the historic Lal Parade Ground here.

She said that whatever was happening today had broken the common man''s back, there was total darkness all around and women were facing big burden.

The area under agriculture was shrinking even as materials used in farming were becoming costlier and farmers were not getting enough price for their produce, Sonia said.

The Congress president alleged that whenever BJP came to power either in the Centre or states, it worked for the destruction of the agriculture and cooperative sectors.

In sharp contrast, the Congress had always worked for the betterment of the agriculture and cooperative sectors which were the backbone of our national economy, she said.

The Congress president said the BJP and its allies believed in coming together only for the sake of their vested interests.

She claimed that all the Congress governments in various states in the country were doing a better job than the NDA government at the Centre.

24,Principals deliberate on trends in education,"NEW DELHI: ""It''s the principals in our lives who teach us about the principles in our lives,"" said The Times of India resident editor Bachi Karkaria at the NIE (Newspaper in Education) principals'' seminar â€” Perspectives â€” held at the Conference Hall, Elysee, Crowne Plaza Surya on Friday.

The seminar, an annual feature of NIE, The Times of India, is a continuous effort to build links with guardians of education to give education a new meaning.

Drawing a parallel between education and journalism, Karkaria said both started as noble professions, and were now becoming conscious of market realities. There is a need in both the professions to strike a balance between what is noble and what is practical, she said.

The Times of India consulting editor Dr Dileep Padgaonkar in his address said The Times of India, as a vanguard of society, was aware of its responsibilities.

Educational issues are considered seriously and covered regularly in its pages, he said. He went on to invite suggestions from principals on how a newspaper could supplement its efforts in this regard.

Perspectives, sponsored by HCL Infosystems Ltd, provided a platform to over 250 principals from leading schools of Delhi to present different perspectives on shaping the young during the principal-editorial interface.

Uttam School for Girls principal Asha Nair felt that a powerful medium like The Times of India should do more to reinforce traditional values. Dr Padgaonkar referred to the constant involvement of Times Foundation â€” a special body created by Times Group chairman Mrs Indu Jain â€” in adding the spiritual dimension to our lives.

Army Public School, Delhi Cantonment, principal Lt Col T C Aghi said the NIE should bring aptitude tests to schools. ""Especially for Class 10 students. NIE has been conducting a lot of workshops in art, craft and music, adding psychometric testing would be another plus as it can help students make a choice of career,"" he suggested.

Bhaskar Das, part of the decision making group of The Times of India and brand custodian, The Economic Times, focused on today''s generation. He said this generation of ""screen-agers"" did not live in a cultural cocoon.

The role of newspapers is to build the link with classroom teaching by keeping them abreast, and satisfying their appetite to learn, he said.

The top 27 NIE member school students who scored the highest marks in CBSE Class 10 (2001-2002) exams were awarded Times Scholarship of Rs 4,000 each along with a certificate and a memento by Times Group executive editor Ravi Dhariwal. Delhi Times editor Sabina Sehgal Saikia was also present on the occasion.

HCL Infosystems Ltd focussed on how technology is integrated with our lives, making learning fun, creative and enriching. The presentation by Jyotin Verma, country head Toshiba, and Rajan Rahi, national marketing manager Desktop, provided a glimpse of how technology will compliment education in the changing times.
