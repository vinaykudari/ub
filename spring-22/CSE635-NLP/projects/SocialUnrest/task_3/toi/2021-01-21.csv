0,Bush shows interest in India's polls,"WASHINGTON: US president George W Bush has evinced keen interest in the upcoming elections in India amid what appears to be a broad sentiment in the ruling circles of both countries that their return to power will help maintain the momentum of Indo-US relations.

In the last high-level contact between New Delhi and Washington before India goes to the polls in a few weeks, external affairs minister Yashwant Sinha was invited to meet Bush at the White House Oval Office on Tuesday. Several topics were on the plate, but the most delectable one was Indian democracy, a subject of enduring curiosity and interest for Bush from the time he assumed Presidency.

Bush reportedly asked Sinha several questions about the electoral process in the context of the upcoming elections, expressing surprise at the size of some of the constituencies. Although Sinha later told newsmen that â€œthere is a feeling on both sides that the elections will not be allowed to interfere with bilateral relations,â€™â€™ he left everyone guessing by saying he could not fully share what the American leaders had told him about the subject.

Clearly, there is a great deal of fraternal affection between the Grand Old Party of America and the rather new ruling party of India. They seem to be two rightist brothers-in-arms.

1,"HC advises doctors, govt to make peace","HYDERABAD: Playing the role of an â€˜elder statesman,â€™ a two-member bench of the High Court on Wednesday recommended setting up a committee to sort out the issues raised by the junior doctorsâ€™ strike. At the same time, it nudged the doctors to consider suspending their agitation.

The government said in court that it would consider the advice, but later in the evening, it indicated its continued to stand tough by shifting to hospital two fasting doctors, Dr V Chandra Sekhar and Dr S Udayakumar, who were on an indefinite hunger strike at the Osmania Medical College.

Hearing a public interest petition questioning the strike, the bench comprising chief justice Devender Gupta and justice G Rohini passed no formal order but suggested that an independent committee be set up to find a solution to the dispute. They directed the two sides to nominate their representatives who will put their case to the committee.

Additional advocate-general Ramesh Ranganathan said he would advise the government suitably,while senior counsel K G Kannabiran appearing for the striking doctors complained of arm-twisting by the state. The doctors have suggested the name of former Khammam MP Y Radhakrishna Murty as their representative to the committee.

Asked to comment on the â€˜adviceâ€™ rendered by the court, the chief minister later said he would take a decision after going through the details and consulting his cabinet colleagues.

Meanwhile, the Junior Doctorsâ€™ Association claimed the High Court advice would nullify the state governmentâ€™s move to suspend ten of its leaders.

Claiming that the decision to suspend doctors was only a pressure tactic, the doctors said that if the government wanted to suspend the agitators, all the striking junior doctors were equally â€˜eligibleâ€™ for suspension.

Over 10,000 written requests will be submitted all over the state to respective medical college principals by the junior doctors asking for suspension of every APJUDA member rather than just the ten as declared by the government.

In the city over 2,000 such requests may be submitted.

2,Govt may go for new quota policy,"LUCKNOW: To create fissures in the ranks of dalits and backwards the Mulayam government is toying with the idea of implementing a new reservation policy which is akin to the one propounded by the then chief minister Rajnath Singh in 2001.

Sources in the government told Times News Network the new policy would be worked out on the basis of recommendations made by the Samajik Nyay Samiti. Known in political circle as a baby of Rajnath Singh, the then BJP chief minister who had thought that his new reservation policy would badly divide dalits and OBCs and bring electoral dividends to his party.

However, Singhâ€™s scheme did not bring any cheer to him because the high court had stayed its implementation. Now the stay having been lifted, the government was free to implement it, admitted an official. One of the high points of the recommendations of the Samajik Nyay Samiti was that it proposed that ati-pichhadi castes would get a reservation of 9 per cent in jobs though it had 18.9 per cent population among backward castes in the state. In this category, Kurmi, Lodh, Gujjar and Jat were included.

Then the atyadhik pichhadi castes which had 61.69 per cent population of the backwards were proposed a reservation of 14 per cent. And the other backwards which had a population of 19.40 per cent, were to remain content with reservation of merely 5 per cent.

Similarly, dalits were also categorised by the Samajik Nyay Samiti. Dalits, whose population was 19.03 per cent of before the creation of Uttranchal, has gone up to 21.14 per cent. The Samajik Nyay Samiti had separated Chamars from the rest of dalits. The ati-dalits were offered a reservation of 24 per cent of jobs and, although Chamars constituted 55.38 per cent among dalits, Chamars have a participation of 59.42 per cent in jobs.

Now a look at the share of these communities will reveal their actual population with regard to jobs. Pasis account for 15.91 per cent of dalit population but command 10.95 per cent of jobs. Dhobis are only 6.51 per cent, though they have a job share of 8.26 per cent. Koris are 5.38 per cent of the population though they enjoy 3.96 per cent of the jobs. Balmikis are 2.96 per cent but avail 3.19 per cent of jobs. Other castes among dalits are 13.87 per cent but enjoy 9.49 per cent of jobs.

Similarly, among backwards, Yadavs constitute 19.40 per cent but their 36.12 per cent population enjoys jobs. Kurmis are 7.49 per cent but enjoy 9.52 per cent jobs. Jats who are 3.61 per cent enjoy 6.12 per cent of jobs. Lodhs are 4.90 per cent but have 3.75 per cent job. Others are 18.45 per cent but their job share is 16.72 per cent.

3,Education minister gets tough on schools,"NEW DELHI: The honeymoon is over for about 1,000 public schools in the city which were allotted land at concessional rates by the DDA.

Following the high court''s direction, Delhi education minister Arvinder Singh Lovely has asked schools to submit details on their land allotment and present student enrolment.

The Delhi High Court on Tuesday had issued a directive on reservation of up to 25 per cent seats for underprivileged students, in response to a PIL.

""We will ensure that the court order is complied with. Meetings with principals have already started and all schools have been asked to submit relevant documents,"" says Lovely.

The minister has further made it clear that the schools'' claims that they are already running special ""projects"" for underprivileged students will not be taken into consideration.

""The government welcomes the initiatives that schools have taken to hold special classes for underprivileged students. However, institutions will still have to comply with the court''s directive on reserving a specific percentage of seats for these students,"" says Lovely.

The high court order has left public schools gasping for breath with no escape routes in sight.

The institutions had been given land on concessional rates by the DDA against their promise to reserve a fixed number of seats for underprivileged students. The percentage varies from school to school and goes up to 25 per cent.

The directorate of education which now has four months to submit a feedback report to the high court, says it had tried to implement the DDA agreement in the past as well, but schools did not respond.

6,"Wipe out NDA in polls: Priyanka, Rahul","AMETHI: After having claimed on Tuesday that their visit to Amethi had nothing to do with politics, Gandhi siblings Priyanka and Rahul on Wednesday asked Congress workers to ""wipe out"" the NDA in the coming Lok Sabha polls.

""There is no room for complacency and the need of the hour is to put to use all our might to trounce the NDA in the elections,"" Priyanka told a gathering of party workers at the Sanjay Gandhi Hospital guest house near Munshiganj, 30 km from here.

Members of all the frontal organisations of the party were present at the meeting, which was also addressed by Rahul, who is visiting mother Sonia Gandhi''s constituency after a long time.

The Gandhi siblings asked the party workers to strengthen the Congress at the grassroots level ""kyonki Amethi se uthne wale toofan se BJP ka poori tarah safaya ho jayega (as the storm arising from Amethi will wipe out the BJP)"".

Earlier, they addressed a meeting of the Seva Dal, the Youth Congress, the women cell and block presidents at the guest house.

While Rahul spoke about his mother becoming the next Prime Minister, Priyanka hinted that his brother would henceforth be in charge of the Amethi constituency.

Despite a steady drizzle since early morning, a large number of party workers assembled at the guest house to meet the Gandhi children.

Braving the downpour, Priyanka and Rahul visited about 50 harijan houses in Salon, a segment of the Amethi parliamentary constituency.

7,Raw deal likely for Patna farmers,"PATNA: The state legislature may not be able to help the farmers of the state who suffered on account of high breed Cargill maize seeds marketed by multinational seed company Monsanto last year. In February last year, the farmers found to their dismay that their plants had failed to give fruits, thus creating a major disaster for them in Vaishali, Khagaria, Muzaffarpur, East Champaran, West Champaran and other districts. The crop failure had led to an uproar in the legislature last March and assembly Speaker Sadanand Singh had announced constitution of a House panel to probe the crop failure.

Almost 10 months later, the House panel finds itself in a fix. According to the statistics obtained by it, the multinational company had marketed 28 lakh quintal of seeds in the state. The House committee members are inclined to recommend a Rs 100-crore compensation to the farmers who had purchased the seeds.

However, according to the panel members, Monsanto has obtained certificates from both Central and state agricultural institutions which assert that the seeds sold by the company were perfectly all right. The crop failure has been attributed to the â€œunusually prolonged cold waveâ€� witnessed by the state last year.

â€œHow can we recommend action against the multinational company when the state and the Central government agencies are giving it certificates,â€� remarked a bitter member of the panel.

Before marketing of any seed, the state agriculture department has to certify it to be fit for the farmers of Bihar, the members of the House panel said. They alleged that the state agricultural department was too busy trying to save its own skin than caring for the farmers of the state.

The panel headed by deputy Speaker Bhola Prasad Singh has met more than four times to decide its recommendations. Several of its members like Navin Kishore Prasad Sinha have demanded going ahead with the demand for compensation from the multinational company for the affected farmers.

Incidentally, the state has become a major grower of maize in the last three years.

8,Long hands of law are short for this man,"PATNA: When molestation of some J&K artists and assault of their colleagues took place in Himgiri Express near Patna last month, railway DIG Kumar Rajesh Chandra talked of slapping National Security Act (NSA) on the main accused â€” RJDâ€™s ward councillor Ashok Yadav. One month on, while there is no word about invoking NSA against him, Ashok, an absconder in police files, has laughed all the way to the office of the Patna Water Board chairman.

A protege of CMâ€™s brother Sadhu Yadav, the absconding â€œmolesterâ€� has few critics in the RJD. Several senior leaders and even ministers, when contacted on Wednesday, pleaded they cannot afford to have enemies within the party in an election year.

Soon after the molestation incident, the police raided Ashok Yadavâ€™s house and his in-lawâ€™s place. But at least 15 ward councillors came out in his support, accusing the police of â€œharassing the social workerâ€�. The police seemingly took the cue and gave up looking for him.

A senior rail police official on Wednesday admitted a non-bailable warrant and property attachment order have been issued by the court against Ashok. â€œBut the attachment order was not executed because the accused had applied for anticipatory bail. Now we have heard that the bail petition has been rejected, and the attachment order will be executed,â€� the official added.

Ashok, like many others flaunting their links with the stateâ€™s family no. 1, came to limelight in 1997 â€” beating his chest on the bonnet of the car taking RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav to jail for the first time in connection with the fodder scam. â€œSince then, it has been a rags to riches story for him. Now he owns buses and has even been provided with government security,â€� said a minister.

Last year, Ashok even contested the Patna legislative council seat with the â€œblessingsâ€� of Sadhu Yadav.

9,Is state heading for joint elections?,"BANGALORE: Even as chief minister S.M. Krishna and KPCC president B. Janardhana Poojary spoke in different voices on polls, there were enough indications on Wednesday from ruling party circles that Karnataka was heading for simultaneous elections.

While Krishna chose to describe Poojaryâ€™s persistent stand on simultaneous polls as ""speculation and that the Congress high command will take a decision,"" the latter said, ""take it from me that Lok Sabha and Assembly polls will be together.""

It is learnt that Krishna will firm up his decision on the poll schedule after Congress president Sonia Gandhiâ€™s visit to Karnataka on January 23 followed by cabinet meeting on January 30. Both Krishna and Poojary met party MPs on Wednesday over breakfast to elicit opinion on elections.

Later speaking to reporters Poojary said: ""Ninety five per cent of our MPs feel elections to Parliament and Assembly should be held simultaneously. The matter will be brought to the high commandâ€™s notice.

""I had predicted 11 months ago that general elections will be held in April-May. That time, people, including few ministers laughed at me. Now, my words have come true,"" he added.

When pointed out that CM had made his intentions clear about holding elections in September, Poojary said: ""People have given Krishna a mandate to govern the state for five years. He is speaking in his capacity as head of the state.""

Asked whether he favoured simultaneous polls, Krishna remarked: ""I invite you to speculate on this"".

On the budget being presented early, Krishna said the decision to place it in February was not taken overnight. ""For the last six months, we have been saying that budget will be presented early. It might happen during February second week.""

Former chief minister S. Bangarappa said he too favours holding simultaneous polls. Asked about the state Congress leadership issue, raised by him, he said: ""It is for the high command to take a suitable decision.""

10,Cong assails govt's poll-eve sops,"NEW DELHI: Assailing the NDA government for announcing ""another slew of measures"" for farmers, fishermen and urban street vendors, the Congress on Wednesday said, ""This is nothing but an attempt at collective bribery just before the Lok Sabha polls.""

The measures and concessions announced so far would put an additional burden of Rs 23,000 crore on the state exchequer, Congress spokesman Abhishek Singhvi said. The party would complain to the EC, he added.

It termed as ""unethical and misuse of taxpayers'' money"" the government''s announcements after the Union cabinet''s meeting on Tuesday.

""The ruling NDA is creating an uneven playing field by misusing taxpayers'' money,"" Singhvi said. This, he said, amounted to ""cheating"" and demanded that it must stop.

Although the model code of conduct will come into force only after the poll notification is issued, the government should not have announced the measures, Singhvi said.

11,"Gogoi, Sarkar clash in public","NEW DELHI: The Centre''s policy towards the North-East got an unlikely advocate in Congress chief minister of Assam Tarun Gogoi, who clashed in full public view with his Tripura counterpart, Manik Sarkar, on Wednesday.

The problem began during the joint press conference by five CMs of North-Eastern states when Sarkar said, ""The Centre has consistently ignored the problems of the region and its development since independence."" To his shock, Gogoi retorted, ""I don''t agree with you.""

The matter did not end here. Gogoi went on to say that had he known Sarkar holds this opinion, he would not have come to the conference at all.

Realising that Sarkar was also hitting out at the Congress rule at the Centre for the better part of the last 50 years, Gogoi listed the work done by the Centre in the North-East.

""The Centre has brought development projects like roads and highways, oil refineries and set up universities in the region,"" Gogoi said.

The matter ended with a completely shaken Sarkar saying that there should be no debate and the press conference should continue.

With the issue settled, the CMs demanded action against militants by Bangladesh and Myanmar. ""The Centre should also arrange for the extradition of the identified militants from the neighbouring countries,"" they said, adding the problem of militancy in the North-East should be recognised as a national problem.

They also demanded rapid economic growth of the North-East and substantial boost to trade with neighbouring countries as well as with the South-East Asian countries.

12,French Muslim minister backs headscarf ban,"MUMBAI: It is always refreshing to meet a Muslim woman who wields power in government and does not hesitate to speak her mind. Meet Tokia Saifi, of Algerian origin, minister of state for sustainable development in the French government.

She favours a white pant suit, bobbed hair, lipstick, and shades on her head. And although she was in the city to attend the World Social Forum, she doesn''t spare the Left parties in France.

With a five-million-strong Muslim population mostly of immigrant origin, France is currently exercised over a proposed law banning the prominent display of religious symbols in schools, including headscarves by Muslim schoolgirls.

""I strongly support the ban,"" she says emphatically. ""Insistence on a dress code is one more way in which Islamic people are manipulated by the fundamentalists, and must be nipped in the bud. People must be able to choose what to wear, the mullahs should not force them.""

She is annoyed that the real issues of Muslim immigrants are being side-tracked by distractions like the dress code.

""The real discrimination against immigrants and their descendants is economic. Unemployment in France is around 10 per cent, but among French immigrants it is 60 per cent and must be given priority,"" she says.

Saifi, who has also been a member of the European Parliament and vice-president of the European parliamentary delegation for relations with Maghreb and Gulf nations, has risen from the ranks.

The daughter of Algerian immigrants who migrated to France in 1945, she was born in northern France into a family of seven boys and three girls. Her father used to be a worker in the iron and steel industry.

""Since I was young I have been involved in movements fighting discrimination against immigrants, especially since the rise of (extreme right-wing leader) Jean-Marie Le Pen,"" she says.

13,HP BJP against simultaneous polls,"SHIMLA: The state BJP legislature party at its meeting at Hamirpur in a resolution dared chief minister Virbhadra Singh to hold the assembly elections in the state with the forthcoming Lok Sabha elections, to test the popularity of the Congress party and its government.

It said that there was a lot of talk by Virbhadra Singh and his supporters of the developmental works having been done by the present government, and the popular support it had from the masses, and if this was true the Congress should call for fresh assembly elections, to know where it stands.

The resolution also condemned the attitude of Virbhadra Singh of not allowing BJP legislators to speak from the same platform from which the chief minister is addressing the public gatherings, despite theirs representing the assembly segments, which was against the tenets of democracy.

Alleging that the chief minister was making a mockery of democracy, the resolution said that though the government was spending money on the public meetings, yet the elected BJP representatives were not invited to the functions and if they did reach there, they were not allowed to address the gatherings.

Claiming that because of the factionalism within the Congress party, the chief minister was inviting such people to the meetings who had been expelled from the party, it said that Virbhadra was all out to throttle democracy in Himachal, and that the BJP would fight the ""emergency-like"" situation tooth and nail.

By another resolution the BJP legislature party expressed concern over the deteriorating law and order situation in the state, adding that the police force was being used for the security of the chief minister and his battery of ministers, rather than of the common man. The little of the police force that was not used in security of the ministers, was being used to frame false cases against political opponents, it added.

It highlighted various criminal incidents that had occurred eversince the present government took office to press home its point and appealed to the people of the state to teach a lesson to the Congress party in the forthcoming Lok Sabha elections to ensure that their interests are met.

A meeting of the ""I"" group held at senior leader K Karunakaran''s residence in Thiruvananthapuram on Thursday morning decided to take a final decision on the issue on January 28 when a meeting of all its leaders from the 14 districts are summoned.

The Karunakaran group had been pressing for removal of A K Antony from Chief Ministership. But it has of late scaled down the demand, and instead, has been asking for a cabinet reshuffle. In the reshuffle the Karunakaran group wanted its one time-ally-turned-foe K V Thomas, now tourism minister thrown out and PCC-I president K Muralidharan given an important portfolio.

Briefing the media on the decisions taken by the group meeting, KPCC general secretary Rajmohan Unnithan said that the group would also take steps to strengthen its activities, in view of the coming Lok Sabha elections.

The programme, Jagmohan''s brainchild, will mean the relocation of thousands of dedicated Congress voters.

""I feel we should rise above party politics. I have relocated slums in areas where I do not fight polls, what about that?"" he said.

However, Congress councillor from the area Farhad Suri insisted that Gautampuri Colony II was chosen first as it falls in Jagmohan''s New Delhi parliamentary constituency. ""Why not start from the Okhla end of the Pushta?"" he said.

After a visit to the area late in the evening, Dikshit directed Delhi finance minister A K Walia and Minto road MLA Tajdar Babar to ""inspect"" the plots where relocation has to take place â€” Madanpur Khadar and Narela.
