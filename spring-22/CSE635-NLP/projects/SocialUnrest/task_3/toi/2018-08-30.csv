""the state had received rs 113 crore from nabard. chamba district got rs 70 lakh, hamirpur rs 89 lakh and though shimla district got rs 43 crore, jubbal-kotkhai did not get a single penny. why? because it is represented by ram lal,"" he alleged.

6,'Free power to farmers impractical',"hyderabad:the transmission corporation of andhra pradesh limited, on wednesday has termed demands for free power for as farmers as 'impractical'. it said the scheme would cost rs 2,130 crore per annum and not rs 300 crore as being projected in some quarters. the transco in a press statement also said extending free power supply to agriculture is undesirable and against the spirit of 'common minimum action plan', agreed upon in the of chief ministers' conference in 1996. the transco said if free power scheme if implemented, would lead to indiscriminate use of energy with inefficient pumpsets, non installation of capacitors in addition to over exploitation of ground water potential creating drought conditions. the transco also noted that no financial institution would come forward to provide any assistance if power was supplied free and disclosed that even central government assistance against schemes for reforming states would cease to flow in. explaining the logistics, the transco said the agricultural consumption during 1983-84 was only 1,540 million units whereas it went up to 10,154 million units during 2000-2001, which is more than seven times. the transco recalled that one time cost of average cost of extending power supply to one agriculture pumpset of five horse power capacity worked out to be rs.30,000. the chief ministers' conference has agreed upon a common minimum action plan, according to which the power to agriculture is to be charged at 50 paise per unit initially and gradually increased to 50 percent of average cost of supply in about three years tim. the transco stated that cost to serve the agriculture was estimated at rs 2.19 per unit against the revenue demand per unit of rs 0.23, providing for a subsidy of rs 1.96 per every unit.

7,It's time Indian law gave pre-nups their due: experts,"mumbai: if hollywood idols michael douglas and catherine zeta jones had signed their pre-nuptial agreement in india, she would never have been able to force michael to cough up the five million pounds he had promised to pay each time he cheats on her. though popular in the west, pre-nuptial agreements are yet to gain legitimacy in india. a pre-nuptial agreement, or pre-nup, is simply a contract signed by a couple-to-be to set forth each other's rights in separate property, income,alimony, child support and inheritance from each other during the marriage, in case of divorce, or death of either spouse. however, in india, though a wanna-be couple is free to sign a pre-nup, the agreement is not enforceable by law, except in goa, which follows the portuguese civil code (pcc). for many indians, who believe mangalsutras transcend materialism, a pre-nup at first glance may seem to be a mockery of marriage. however, several legal eagles feel the concept is misunderstood. ""in the absence of a uniform civil code, and with different communities following their personal laws — which are not necessarily based on the concept of equality in marriage — a pre-nup is the best thing that can happen to india,"" says advocate prarthana awasthi. here, the couple waiting to wed can draw up, by mutual consent, the terms and conditions to be followed during the marriage or in case of a divorce or death. ""however, if a spouse chooses not to abide by the pre-nup, the other cannot seek refuge with the law to enforce the terms,"" ms awasthi says. to start with, pre-nups could be recognised in marriages that take place under the special marriage act, she suggests. veena gowda, a women's rights lawyer, says, ""a nikah-nama, which is a contract signed in case of a marriage under the muslim personal law, comes quite close to a pre-nup. but then again, a lot depends on the terms of the contract and what a couple chooses to draw from it."" advocate merlyn monteiro likens a pre-nup to the concept of a live-in relationship, wherein the couple lives together but without their relationship being recognised by law. ""in a pre-nup too, a couple mutually agrees to abide by certain terms, but the agreement does not have legal sanction,"" she says. once the habitat of the rich and the famous, pre-nups in the us have now entered the domain of the common man. the contract is intended to change what would occur by law if there is a divorce or if a spouse dies. explaining the scenario in goa, high court counsel joquin reis says, ""under the pcc, which was enforced when goa was still a portuguese colony, post-marriage, the property of the spouses enters into a common pool with each spouse entitled to a 50 per cent share. a couple can sign a pre-nup contract choosing not to be governed by the pcc and stating that what they own is their own"". mr reis, however, feels that the concept will not work in india as it adds a commercial dimension to a marriage. ""also, in india couples continue to wear blinkers that a marriage is for keeps and it will take some time before they can actually come to terms with the concept of planning a divorce,"" says madhulika mathur, ceo of weddingsutra, a wedding planning portal. with the rise in the rate of divorce and increase in the number of second marriages, pre-nuptials have proved helpful in: protecting property owned prior to marriage, inheritance, proceeds from the sale of separate property during marriage; ascertaining which assets accumulated during the marriage will be joint and which separate; dealing with practical matters of running the household like holding a joint account for day-to-day living expenses, ownership of automobiles, gifts to each other and ownership rights of residence; specifying employment benefits and the method of future distribution of pension plans or stock options; specifying that certain property and income is to remain separate property and is not subject to division in the event of a divorce; protection of assets for children born of prior marriages. in case of a second marriage, each spouse may not want to pass bulk of his/her property to children from prior marriage; in case of inter-religion marriages, parties can state the particular religious environment their children will be raised in; a waiver of either party's right to spousal support; protecting various properties of family members or business acquaintances who may not have a claim under the deceased party's estate.

8,State govt hikes water charges,"mumbai: faced with a huge wage bill and a debt trap, the maharashtra government on wednesday hiked the charges on water utilised for drinking, irrigation and industrial purposes. the move is expected to raise additional revenue to the tune of rs 650 crore. following the decision, the water released to the agriculture sector will now be costly by 50 per cent, while the rates of water utilised for production of aerated drinks or distilled bottled water manufactures will go up by 10 times. this was stated by chief minister vilasrao deshmukh at a press conference held after the weekly cabinet meeting at mantralaya on wednesday. ""we have decided to reasonably raise the water charges on the recommendations made by the second irrigation commission and tenth finance commission,"" mr deshmukh said, adding that such a hike was necessitated as the revenue recovered from the water bills was less in comparison to the expenditure on maintenance of projects and administrative costs. ""presently the charges for water utilised by farmers cultivating banana, sugarcane or fruits is rs 3,00 per hectare per year. the charges for kharif rice and rabi wheat are rs 240 per hectare. drinking water charges are rs 1.80 per 10,000 litre, rs 27.25 per 10,000 litre for industrial use and 0.27 paise for units using water as a raw material,"" he said. mr deshmukh said the revenue from all sources was merely rs 175 crore, as against this, the state spent rs 413 crore annually on maintenance and operation costs of irrigation projects and another rs 375 crore on salaries of its staffers and a whopping rs 1, 155 crore towards interests on its huge borrowings. earlier, the chief minister said the 13,000-odd lecturers in aided and un-aided colleges across the state appointed between september 1991 and december 1999 will be required to clear the national entrance test/ state entrance test before december 2003. ""lecturers who do not clear this examination will not be removed from service but they will not be considered for further promotions,"" mr deshmukh said.

9,Experts see pollution from trucks,"new delhi: the unchecked plying of about 3,000 trucks overloaded with construction material at night in the capital have negated the efforts being made to reduce the pollution level in the city. experts feel the numerous steps which were taken to improve the quality of life in the capital following the supreme court's intervention have been nullified by the polluting trucks that crisscross the city at night. ""either these trucks unload sand dust, grits and crushed stones from nearby stone quarries in the city or pass through the capital at night to reach their destinations in haryana and up, an expert said. referring to a report that the capital did not experience any significant change in the pollution level despite taking steps like closing polluting industries and banning commercial diesel vehicles, he said the pollution control boards had overlooked the fact that each truck, though entitled to carry only nine metric ton of load, was allowed to carry upto a whopping 40 tonnes in gross violation of laws. starting from mines in faridabad and gurgaon, these trucks were also found to be plying on a road through a reserved forest area, thus violating the environment laws as well. ironically, though the fleet of 3000-odd trucks make as many as 10,000 rounds in a day, the authorities were yet to take any action against the polluting caravan. unlike south india where the truck body is half, the trucks in the north are of different shapes which facilitates carrying of goods and material beyond prescribed capacity. the expert said the overloaded trucks also damage the roads and pose a threat to people. ""the increasing number of road accidents involving overloaded trucks the hazardous nature of this caravan,"" he said, hoping that the apex court would take note of this neglected aspect too.

10,Govt initiates changes in civic poll rules,"mumbai: presidents of all municipal councils in maharashtra will henceforth be directly elected by the people for a five-year term and any proposal to unseat an elected president would require sanction from three-fourth majority of the house. these are among the prominent reforms initiated by the state government in the election process to local self-government bodies which were announced by chief minister vilasrao deshmukh at a press conference held after the weekly cabinet meeting at mantralaya on wednesday. ""we have initiated changes in the existing rules that govern the election process to municipal councils and we are also contemplating to extend the same rules for municipal corporations,"" mr deshmukh told newspersons. the changes to the existing election process are politically significant as 172 of the 230 municipal councils in maharastra will go to polls early next year. the polls to the local self-government bodies are crucial to all political parties as it determines the popularity ratings and the acceptability of the party and its leaders at the grassroots level. the state government has also decided to introduce a panel system in municipal councils whereby a maximum of five wards will be clubbed together and will constitute as one panel. each panel will comprise of a women candidate and also those from the reserved category to ensure that all sections of the society are adequately represented. mr deshmukh also said that any councillor who gets elected to the state assembly or parliament will automatically lose claim as municipal councillor and the seat will be declared vacant. earlier, the chief minister said 7,262 villages in 12 districts of maharashtra have been declared as scarcity hit with the locals struggling for drinking water and fodder for their cattle. mr deshmukh said the union government has sanctioned rs 100 crore to the state government for taking up programmes to aid the scarcity-hit villages. among other measures, the state government has decided to waive the examination fees of all students appearing for the board or university exams from these 12 districts. moreover, the government has also decided to give a 33 per cent exemption of payment in the electricity bills to farmers in these districts. aurangabad region is the worst affected with as many as 3, 904 villages declared as scarcity hit, followed by 2,291 villages in pune region and 1,206 in nashik division, mr deshmukh said.

13,Budding netas do BA after BA or MA for political PhD,"new delhi: sporting the tag of a double ba is back in fashion, or so it seems for delhi university student union aspirants. a number of candidates have taken readmission in ba (pass) in a different college this year after completing the course last year. but then it is not academic excellence, but ""leadership"" that seems to be on the mind of these candidates. even where shifting of colleges and repeating a course is concerned, the groups ^ right-wing akhil bharatiya vidyarthi parishad and its rival national students union of india ^ are in neck-to-neck competition. in an era where student elections have become an extension of mainstream politics with parties pumping in moolah and endorsement of national leaders, the dusu seems to have become to a stepping stone to the bigger political arena. the code of conduct remains mainly on paper. the poll war is fought with colourful posters. who cares if the rules ban posters and the ceiling for the money to be spent is rs 10,000. student issues too remain largely on paper and are repeated in party manifestos year after year. considering the fact only 30 per cent of the total du population of 70,000 vote every year, the average student's interest can very well be gauged. moreover, only 52 of the 79 colleges are affiliated to the students union. the academic and political record of dusu candidates is enough to highlight these facts. there are several examples of dusu leaders going on to contest, and win, municipal and assembly seats. then there are those who hold important positions in the city bjp and congress units. dpcc president subhash chopra, for instance, was dusu president in 1970-71. and arun jaitley, bjp's high profile leader, was dusu president in 1974-75. du chief election officer rajiv khanna feels it is more a question of student ``leadership'' than academic excellence, which prompts the aspirants to take readmission. there are no rules that would disqualify the dusu aspirants from pursuing double degrees and therefore continue as students. take the abvp for instance. three of the four candidates have taken readmission in an undergraduate course. the most interesting case is that of presidential candidate pragati badhwar who has taken admission in b com first-year in swami shraddhanand college after completing her ma in buddhist studies and ba (pass) from bharatiya mahila college. secretarial candidate suresh maan and joint secretarial candidate vivek bidhuri have both taken admission in ba (pass) in the same college after having completed the course from satyawati and dayal singh (evening) colleges respectively. the nsui is not far behind. vice-presidential candidate tarun kumar completed his ba (pass) from satyawati college before taking admission in ba (pass) again in swami shraddhanand college this year. two others have shifted colleges after completing iind year of ba (pass). secretarial candidate vikas shokeen completed his two years in rajdhani college before taking admission in swami shraddhanand this year. similar is the case of joint secretary candidate rohit chaudhry who shifted from shivaji to swami shraddhanand. significantly, the disqualification rules are few, the main points being: conviction for criminal offence, debarring by the university for using unfair means or having been penalised for ragging. students within the age limit of 26 years for morning colleges and 30 years for evening are eligible. ``the student also should not have been in the university for more than seven years,'' khanna added.

20,To rename or not to rename roads: BCC evolves policy,"bangalore: the bangalore city corporation (bcc) on wednesday decided to evolve a policy for renaming roads and public places to end indiscriminate name changes. it also set november 1 as the deadline to dispose pending road renaming proposals. the issue was discussed at length in the bcc council meeting on wednesday. former mayor padmavati gangadhara gowda who raised the issue complained that roads were being renamed on the whims and fancies and that bcc had no clear policy to regulate it. in support, corporators cutting across party lines complained that there have been differences on the issue. when the corporators move a proposal to rename a road and implement it, local legislators often oppose it. mayor prema cariappa said in the past, many roads were renamed but the new names are seldom used as they are not involved in day-to-day correspondence. in his reply, commissioner ashok dalwai said there was a procedure to rename the roads but was not followed. henceforth, as per the policy, the member who proposes to rename a road will first have to seek the opinion of the area residents and also get it inspected by bcc officials to verify that the same name is not used elsewhere. the proposal will then go to the town planning standing committee. however, the proposal will also be placed in front of the commissioner who will have a final say in the issue after which the matter would be presented in the council for approval. but, the ultimate discretion rests with the state government as the bcc is empowered to only name the new roads and cannot rename them, he said. dalwai assured the house that all the pending road renaming proposals will be cleared before november 1. chaos over uniforms and sports materials: the council also witnessed noisy scenes over the delay in distribution of sewing machines, uniforms for bcc school students and sports materials. dalwai said the approved resolution to purchase tailoring machines has been sent to the government and the reply is expected within a week. supplementing, deputy commissioner (social welfare) y.k. muddu krishna said the khdc had sent three samples of uniform material which would be examined and the proposal will be sent to the concerned standing committee. he said quality of the textile will be ensured as the samples will be tested as per isi standards. basement issue: to a question raised by gangabhyraiah (bjp) about the status of basements being used for commercial activities, legal officer n. madaiah said in 1999, trade licences of all the establishments functioning from the basements had been withdrawn. nearly eight cases are pending with the government, four in the court and the bcc is planning to file caveats in case of 12 basements hotels. the corporators also made a noise over the delay in the commencement of civil works in several areas. however, engineer-in-chief r. jaiprasad clarified that civil works have already been started and other works would be taken up as and when funds were made available.

23,Extortionists rule the roost in Muzaffarpur town,"muzaffarpur: there has been an alarming increase in cases of extortion in this town in recent months. even betel shop owners are not being spared by them. the demand and payment of ""rangdari tax"" are being made secretly as no businessman wants to invite the wrath of the criminal despite police assurances. according to north bihar chamber of commerce and industry general secretary dilip kumar tulsyan, the state government has no will power to control crimes. otherwise, the high officials, responsible for maintaining law and order, would have initiated hard preventive measures against the kidnappers who enjoy political patronage, tulsyan said. the latest victim of the ""kidnapping business"" was kumud banka alias golu, 14-year-old son of cloth merchant sawarmal banka. he was kidnapped from the vicinity of the marwari dharmashala in the saraiyaganj locality on independence day. the police have so far failed to rescue the boy, thereby adding to the fears of the trading community about their security. many panicky traders, particularly those dealing in cloth, are seriously planning to leave muzaffarpur. on an average, five to ten small or big traders are falling victim to the wrath of extortionists here every month. the kidnapping of kumud is not an isolated case. he was picked up only because the demand was much higher than the paying capacity of his father, according to informed sources. otherwise, the deal would have been finalised without the kidnapping of golu. except for one or two cases, most of the traders kidnapped earlier were released only after some payment was made by the family members of the victims. it is true the police have worked hard in some cases, of course, on orders from patna but the ""kidnapping business"" continues to thrive. the then finance and minor irrigation minister shankar prasad tekriwal had taken an initiative to apprise his colleagues like ramchandra purve, rama devi and ram prakash mahto of the gravity of the situation. thereafter, the chief secretary, the dgp and other high officials held discussions here. that was followed by the opening of a control room, deployment of forces near important trading centres, intensive patrolling and a decision to issue arms licence to needy traders. but these official decisions turned out to be mere assurances given to the people.

33,Kosi badlands a safe hideout for outlaws,"kosi diara (madhubani): nearly 70,000 people living in 12 panchayats of the kosi diara in madhubani district are not ready to leave their land which remains flooded for nearly five months in a year. this, despite the district administration's claim that proper rehabilitation has been provided to them outside the embankment area. madhubani district magistrate (dm) b rajendra says: these people do not want to lose their land because after the flood, they get bumper crops. however, contrary to the dm's views, many agriculture scientists and farmers feel that the flood-ravaged land has lost its potential to yield bumper crops due to excessive deposition of sand and silt in kosi. as a result, only marginal crops could be cultivated, they add. the fact is the kosi badlands have of late become the hotbed of criminal activities. this area serves as a safe hideout for hardcore criminals. as a mark of gratitude, the criminals oblige the influential villagers with cash and kind, says dilip ram, a 45-year-old farmer of the bhargama village. rustam, a 25-year-old tailor of the mahpatia village, says: the law and order in this area is unique. if somebody tries to violate the 'prevailing law', then gunshots start reverberating in the whole diara. kosi ki dhara mein lash bhi nahi milti hai, he says. perhaps that is the reason the villagers living along the kosi do not protest against the criminal activities in the region which serves as a shelter for the hardcore criminals. but then who would bell the cat? replies keshav jha, a 40-year-old resident of the bheeth-bhagwanpur village: even the malik of the village warmly welcomes these strangers. how can you expect any protest from the poor? jaan hai to jahan hai. the free flow of strangers in this remote area has made some impact on the lifestyle of the local folks as well. expensive brands of liquor and cigarettes have replaced toddy and bidi in the village shops. do these criminals, who use this area as their hideouts, have any foreign link? we don't know but their language and arms are quite foreign to us, says sita ram paswan of the bakua village. not that the district police administration is not aware of the rise in criminal activities in the diara area. but due to lack of complaints, nothing tangible could be achieved so far, bimlesh singh, madhubani superintendent of police, told this correspondent.
