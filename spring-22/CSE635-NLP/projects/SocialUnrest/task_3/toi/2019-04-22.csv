0,2 out of 7 fugitives arrested,"lucknow: two of the seven undertrials who escaped from the lucknow district jail were arrested by the police on sunday in a more filmi style than the one in which they escaped. the arrested undertrials, identified as jitendra kumar maurya and ram lakhan, were nabbed after a hot chase, which seems more unconvincing than the screenplay of even the most disastrous of bollywood ventures. according to the police, after their escape from the district jail, the two went to charbagh railway station where they picked the pocket of a passenger sleeping at the platform and found rs 50 in his purse. the two then went to sitapur. why? police do not know. from sitapur, the two made away with a school bus and reached kamlapur where they abandoned the bus and laid their hands on a jeep (up 34 b 1570) to reach bakshi ka talab. in between, they abandoned the jeep and stole a bicycle from aliganj area but later left the bicycle and made away with the jeep. in bakshi ka talab area, the two broke into a kiosk and stole rs 11 lying in the cash box. they also took away a packet of biscuits and that of a chewing tobacco. subsequently, they reached the taxi stand and took passengers for malihabad but were arrested by the police near mehmood nagar in the night. why did they steal the bus, then switched over to a jeep and then a bicycle before they got back to the jeep? or what did they have in mind ? or was it to add some sensation to the jail-break on the lines of a bollywood thriller? there seems no answer.!

1,Rehabilitating victims unsettles govt,"vadodara: rehabilitating riot victims from rural areas is turning out to be a bigger headache for the state government than finding a home for those in urban areas. attempts at trying to resettle muslims back in their villages have so far received stiff resistance from the local residents, even leading to escalating tension in some cases. at panvad village in tribal chhota udepur, a mere attempt to retrieve belongings from the ashes of their homes proved a difficult task for muslims last week. mobs immediately gathered and tempers rose. the situation became so tense at one point that the district superintendent of police had to rush to the spot. trouble also broke out in a couple of other villages around the same time. says a senior police official, ""even in our meetings with the tribal leaders and sarpanches, some very tricky issues were raised by them for which no easy answers are available."" the villagers demanded everything from withdrawing rioting cases to asking a particular community to refrain from raising certain kind of slogans. ""the demands are not only difficult to meet, but also very weird in nature. the only intention behind raising them seems to be creating hurdles in allowing the displaced families from returning,"" the official added. the same resistance is seen in village after village across the state barring isolated instance where families have actually returned. in kheda and anand districts, the discrimination was subtler. muslims were cold-shouldered when they returned to their villagers, with residents preferring to stay away from their shops and small businesses. many of them have preferred to return to relief camps in the larger towns like petlad and anand since then. as tribal activist ganesh devy put it, ""you can''t hide behind anonymity in a village. everybody knows everybody, making it very difficult to build bridges. it is comparatively easier where there is a sizeable presence of the minority. in a city, on the other hand, you can merge into a crowd."" devy also believes that apart from strong religious sentiments, there are strong economic reasons for muslims not being welcomed in their villages. ""money-lending is a big business in the tribal belt with muslims controlling a sizeable chunk of it. as a result, hindu money-lenders have a direct interest in ensuring that muslims don''t return."" district officials in the panchmahals are trying to resettle muslims by giving them security in numbers. having faced one of the worst riots after the february 27 train-burning incident, the collectorate at godhra is focusing on the larger villages only and leaving the smaller ones for later. says collector jayanthi ravi, ""we have taken those villages where the muslim population is large. the able-bodied men have gone and resettled in the villages first. the women, children and the elderly will return only after the broken houses are rebuilt and the villagers have become used to the presence of the muslims."" ravi has also put lower-rank officers in charge of ensuring that the muslims are resettled. commenting on the rehabilitation process, vadodara district collector bhagyesh jha said, ""building confidence amongst the two communities is a gradual process. we have had a series of meetings with them and things are moving in the desired direction. in kanwant, as many as 20 families belonging to the minority community have gone back to their homes. others too are willing to do the same."" jha pointed out that the chhota udepur relief camp had only 2,028 people staying there. some others are learnt to be staying in various camps at vadodara. ""over a period of time, we have realised that the tension between the communities is easing. the irate mood in the first meeting has gradually eased.""

2,Shun politics of hatred: V P Singh,"mumbai: â€œhad atalji participated in the freedom struggle, he would not have said what he said in goa, former prime minister v p singh said at a rally for peace and communal harmony here on saturday. â€œpersonal relationships have to be kept aside on occasions like this,â€™â€™ he added. â€œindia won independence by putting up a united fight against the britishers,â€™â€™ he reminded an audience of 5,000 at the sacred heart school at santa cruz. mr singh also questioned the patriotism of the sangh parivar whose actions, he said, caused the army to rush to gujarat to douse the communal flames. these so-called patriots were actually helping the isi to fulfill its aim of weakening india . he further said that the first terrorist in india was nathuram godse and mooted a pota-like law for those spreading communal venom. the former prime minister said the question was not about gujarat but about the country. â€œthe entire nation can catch fire if the citizens do not assert themselves,â€™â€™ he said, adding that the bjpâ€™s hate campaign had the potential of turning the country into another bosnia. cautioning against the overdependence on the army to quell communal violence, he said no army could keep the country united if, at heart, the people were divided. mr singh cited the example of russia which broke up into several countries despite having the largest army. â€œthe countryâ€™s map is not drawn on paper but in the hearts of its citizens, he said, adding that the venue was most apt.â€™â€™ dwelling on the theme of communal harmony, mr singh said that the nation could not remain a nation if one community rejoiced at the sorrows of another. he said that the minorities had made india culturally richer and it would suffer if they were treated as second-class citizens. mr singh lamented that the politics of hatred had sidelined vital issues such as poverty, hunger, drought and economic imperialism. the former prime minister congratulated mumbaikars for not letting the events in gujarat affect it and said that the presence of people from all parts of the city in the rally was indicative of their resolve to fight communalism. earlier, speakers such as director mahesh bhatt, former high court judge s m daud, dalit leader udit raj, lawyer nilofer bhagwat and john dayal, secretary-general of the all-india christian council, which had organised the rally, castigated prime minister atal behari vajpayee and stressed the need to fight fascist forces.

6,New govt order ‘rewards’ forest land grabbers,"medak: the resettlement action plan (rap), announced by the government for encroachers of forest land under the world bank-funded community forest management (cfm) project, is likely to trigger more encroachments. the rap was formulated for those who could lose their livelihood and â€˜to mitigate the adverse effects due to project interventions.â€™ the forest department carried out a social and environmental assessment (sea) in 20 vana samarakshna samithis (vss) out of more than 6,000 vss in the state.the proposed payment of compensation to the encroachers could stir a hornetâ€™s nest, considering that 1.8 million people are to be benefited under the cfm througout the state. in mohammadnagar village in koudipally mandal of medak district, one of the villages where the sea was conducted, 44.80 hectares of forest land was encroached by 26 people â€˜officiallyâ€™. vss president b manik reddy said more people would be tempted to encroach upon forest land, aspiring for the compensation to be provided under the rap. manik reddy said: â€œif the policy is implemented, people would be getting paid for breaking the forest laws.â€� he expressed the fear that political leaders would encourage occupation of forest land to garner votes, as was already done in mohammadnagar and other villages. in an informal vss meet held on saturday, villagers expressed divergent views on the issue with heated verbal exchanges on the possible increase in encroachment of the forest. jangam maneppa, one of the encroachers, said he would vacate the land as he had been promised an alternate source of livelihood. however, mohammadnagar lambadi tanda headman t ramavath said though the community had agreed to settle for compensation, they would prefer alternate land for the encroached land. similar sentiments were expressed by vss president of kanchenapalli, r lakshmaiah. the villagers of tuniki and its vss president g gopal reddy too expressed similar views. neither the rap, nor the resettlement and rehabilitation (r&r) policy and tribal development strategy, mention about the compensation for loss of livelihood under the earlier joint forest management (jfm) project, which led to the current cfm project. loss of livelihood is a violation of the world bankâ€™s operational directives. interestingly, the r&r policy go for the cfm was issued on february 5, prior to the actual comprehensive orders on the cfm project, which were issued on february 12, reportedly under pressure.

7,Mahesh Bhatt tours riot-ravaged Ahmedabad,"ahmedabad: the riot victims sheltered at the relief camp near dariakhan ghummat in the shahibaug area here left a visitor from bollywood - renowned hindi film director mahesh bhatt - stunned in utter disbelief on sunday. when bhatt came down here, it wasn''t a film on the theme of gujarat riots that he had in his mind. the numerous hurdles and difficulties he had to face in 1998 while directing ''zakhm'' - a film based on 1992 riots in mumbai - is still fresh in his mind. ""only i know the administrative and bureaucratic hassles i had to go through in 1998 while making ''zakhm''. i can imagine what it would be like to make anything even closely related to gujarat riots at this juncture,"" bhatt told tnn. he added, ""reaching out to riot-victims and telling them that they are not alone is more important than making a movie. i am here to see the happenings here and then tell the world (at the top of his voice, one may add) about the murder of secularism and democracy in gujarat. i want to tell my fellow countrymen how their stoic silence is proving costly for india."" bhatt was in city along with mumbai-based criminal-lawyer a majeed memon, another bombay high court advocate iqbal yusuf, maulana athar ali and two other businessmen. the film director also got a taste of the communal violence when he and his team had to cancel their trip to the relief camp in shah-e-alam roza and rush back to holiday inn at khanpur after violence broke out in labour-dominated areas of the city. ""this was when we were talking to city police commissioner p c pande. as we were telling him how the riot victims blamed the ahmedabad police for colluding and assisting the rioters, reports of more violence and mayhem in the city filtered in. we had to forgo our trip to the shah alam area,"" said bhatt. earlier in the day, bhatt met a group of six ngos and ""learnt from them in graphic details about the gujarat riots"", while memon addressed a group of 15 city lawyers. memon said: ""both bhatt and i are emotionally shattered after hearing the inhumane and gory riot tales from victims and ngos. i was very upset when a senior lawyer told me that even the advocates are feeling insecure and are being targeted by communal elements."" ""but, i still have faith in indian judiciary. i have asked the local lawyers to take riot-related cases of both communities as their prime responsibility, and create a special cell to handle this issue. we have resolved to approach higher judiciary as and when the need arises,"" he added. bhatt said: ""i go back with a resolve to tell the people of my country of what i have seen and felt in gujarat. i will also tell them what the pregnant silence of riot victims told me. the state government is indulging in a cover up operation by trying to show light at the end of tunnel by conducting ssc and hsc exams under heavy security. but reality showed me only an unending tunnel of darkness."" he asserted: ""my father, a nagar brahmin, used to stay in porbander along with my mother, who was a shia muslim. i am a physical representative of india''s secular dream. a dream that is still struggling to become a reality.""

8,No word yet on PPSC selection: Member,"patiala: a member of the punjab public service commission ppsc) amarjit singh chawla has denied reports published in a section of press that the commission had taken any decision to cancel the written examination as well as interviews for the posts of deputy superintendent of police, deputy superintendents of jails, bdpos and district probation officers and lecturers conducted in 1998. chawla said the two-member fact-finding committee comprising him and maj gen (retd) gs riar was still probing the appointments made under the chairmanship of ravi sidhu and examining whether proper procedure had been followed. they would submit the report in the next meeting on april 29. moreover, as the matter was in the court of law, how could they take any decision ignoring the court. chawla said the he along with ppsc members rc gupta and harjit kaur randhawa had been fighting against the alleged corruption by the chairman of the commission ravi sidhu for the last one year. he said the whole system of selection had been hijacked by the chairman and other members were totally ignored.the members were merely informed about the list of selected candidates. when they questioned sidhu, he said they should not bother about it and the practice would continue. he said that there was provision in the ppsc act that the chairman would have to call a meeting of the commission at the request of even one member within three days, but sidhu got it amended that the request had to be from three members and the meeting would be called within seven days. but, as his highhandedness continued, and ignored the opinion of majority of the members, they started boycotting the interviews. the ppsc member said after they knocked on the doors of punjab and haryana high court in june last year, the court called a meeting of the commission under the supervision of its observer. despite repeated objections of ravi sidhu, the members by a majority vote suggested radical changes in the selection system. the minutes of the meeting are still lying in the high court. mooting changes in the act of ppsc, he said there should be fixed guidelines for the examination process, examiner panel and method of evaluation.

10,Is PhD a must for college principals?,"chandigarh: the appointment of the principal of mcm dav college for women is not as per the panjab university and university grants commission regulations.a senator raised this issue at the last pu senate meeting. however, the just concluded pu academic and administrative audit of 102 colleges affiliated to the university has revealed that this is not a one-time incident and the posts of 27 principals of private colleges and 11 in government colleges have not been filled through regular procedures. those who conducted the audit have mentioned this as cause for concern. senator rn sharma, while raising the issue pertaining to the appointment of usha gupta as principal of mcm dav said that she did not fulfil the condition of being a phd, which had been made mandatory by the ugc for all principals appointed after a notification to that effect in 1998. however, persons who were approved to be principal before the 1998 notification could continue as principal even if they did not have a phd qualification. usha gupta was appointed officiating principal towards the end of 2000 and she is not a phd. â€˜â€˜the important thing to consider here is that right under the nose of the university, its own regulation is being flouted. the post has neither been advertised, nor have interviews for a regular principal been conducted ever since the last principle retired almost two years back,â€™â€™ said sharma. when contacted, principal usha gupta said she has no comments to give on the issue. the dean of the college development council prof ramesh kapoor said that the university has written to the college almost two months back to rectify the anomaly. ever since the ugc made phd an essential qualification to be considered as principal, the move has generated considerable controversy. a pu senator informed that college managements have a vested interest in not being too keen on appointing merely a phd-qualified principal. â€˜â€˜they look for an experienced person. if they have to choose between a non-phd experienced teacher and an inexperienced but phd qualified teacher then they would prefer the former,â€™â€™ he said. another trouble with phd is that many senior teachers in college have considerable academic experience but are not in a position to do a phd at that later stage. if they are stopped from becoming principal and a younger faculty member who has completed phd is promoted to principal it would create bitterness and reduce co-operation, which would only be detrimental to college interests. pu principalsâ€™ associations and even the punjab government wrote to the ugc about the practical problems being faced but ugc is firm in its proposal that there would be no compromise in the requirement of phd to be eligible as principal. â€˜â€˜in colleges where ma courses are being taught it may make some sense as the teaching may be at advanced level, but in undergraduate courses, which is the case in most colleges that principals have only got to do administration and have nothing much to do with research. so ugc should not make irrelevant regulations,â€™â€™ said a pu syndicate member adding that colleges feel that if they have to employ a regular person then they must find a phd, so they employ on an adhoc basis till further orders. â€˜â€˜these people are not successful in providing proper leadership as they are not sure for how long the management and the university would allow them to continue in such an adhoc manner,â€™â€™ said a syndicate member.

""there is a long process, but it has to be followed"", he said, adding that the six-year-term of sidhu was due to end in september this year. answering a question on some ias and pcs officers allegedly amassing wealth disproportionate to their known sources of income, he said, ""if any specific complaint comes it will be probed to its logical end. ""i cannot announce a commission to probe allegations against all bureaucrats and politicians,"" he added.

14,BSP fires first salvo on govt formation,"new delhi: in its first ''no-confidence'' move even before a government is formed in up, the bsp has shot down the idea of having a bjp deputy chief minister in the state. while big brother bjp elaborately works out modalities for government formation in up, the bsp is making sure that only one voice carries weight in uttar pradesh: mayawati''s. with the two parties set to form government before may 1, bsp chief kanshi ram on monday put all speculation on power-sharing at rest stating categorically: ""the chief minister will be mayawati. there will be no deputy cm."" once bitten, the bsp wants to avoid parallel power centres. ""there cannot be two power centres,"" explained kanshi ram, recalling the government formation exercise in 1997. for the rest, the two parties will follow the 1997 pattern. kanshi ram also said a common minimum programme had been worked out ""for the weaker sections"". the parties are keen to sew up the deal before the weekend is out. political vicissitudes apart, the need for speed is also necessitated by the fact that parliament has to ratify president''s rule in the state. the process would begin at least a week before, on may 1. thus, the two parties have till then to form the government. the coming together hasn''t been smooth. there has been much dissent in the two parties, which are ideologically poles apart. the blunt refusal to have a bjp lieutenant shadowing mayawati as deputy cm is a clear indication that there is little trust in the new relationship. for the bjp, which is believed to have asked for the post of deputy cm, it may come as a blessing in disguise. choosing a second man could have been a tricky proposition. in fast changing developments, while earlier there were few volunteers for the job of mayawati''s deputy, there was speculation that once government formation seemed a certainty, several senior state bjp leaders made it gently known that they wouldn''t be averse after all. the bjp parliamentary board is likely to meet in a couple of days to give a formal go-ahead to the pact. party president k jana krishnamurthy, who returned to the capital from chennai on monday, said ""the date has not been decided for the board meeting"". it was the parliamentary board which had decided immediately after elections that the bjp would sit in opposition in up after its dismal showing. it was decided at a party meeting last week that the board could now reverse its decision in view of more recent developments to facilitate a tie-up with the bsp.

15,Bellary farmers plan stir for water project,"bellary: farmers from areas surrounding the yalpi-kaggallu lift irrigation project are on the warpath, demanding that the government take up the project, which has been pending for 10 years now. if implemented, the project will irrigate fields on 6,500 acres. janata dal (u) state general secretary n. pratap reddy, who has taken up the issue, said on monday that the farmers are assembling at yalpi-kaggallu village on tuesday and strategies would be chalked out to organise agitations. he warned that the stir could get serious and will continue till the government is ready to accept the demand. if completed, the yalpi-kaggallu project will be a lifeline to the region''s farmers, he said. the government has been putting off the project on flimsy pretexts, despite kpcc president allum veerabhadrappa representing the kurugodu assembly constituency for the last three terms. launching a broadside against the congress, reddy said the party is just not interested. in fact, three lift irrigation projects __ yalpi-kaggallu, kolur and kenchana gudda __ have been drafted and designed and are waiting for implementation for 10 years. allum, who has also been minister for horticulture, has failed to get the project going. though chief minister s.m. krishna is very considerate towards bellary district and accepts developmental proposals, leaders representing the district are ineffective, added reddy. this is a good opportunity to include the project in sonia''s special package, the jd(u) leader felt. making allum his target, reddy said the kpcc president frequently ""lies and misleads the people"" to keep them happy. he cited recent budgetary provisions made for some projects: the yalpi-kaggallu scheme has a project cost of rs 13 crore but the 2002-03 budgetary allocation is just rs 50 lakh, the kenchanagudda lift irrigation scheme costs rs 5.5 crore, for which rs 30 lakh has been set aside and a mere rs 10 lakh has been allocated for the rs 1.10-lakh kolur lift irrigation project. under government norms, a minimum of one-third of project cost must be allocated to take up the project, after which tenders could be called for execution of work, as estimation and design is complete. reddy said these projects cannot be taken up with such meagre budgetary allocation, which means that this year too, the projects will not see the light of day. he squarely blamed allum and kolur basavana goud for the delay. similarly, the government is yet to clear rs 1.76 crore to the karnataka construction corporation, the agency which took up the singatalur lift irrigation project. work on this project has been completely stopped, and the farmers are a disillusioned lot. when j.h. patel was chief minister, four mega irrigation projects __ markandeya costing rs 80 crore, the gandorinala project costing rs 34 crore, the harinala scheme costing rs 24 crore and the singatalur project costing rs 67 crore __ had been taken up. but as soon as h.k. patil assumed charge as major irrigation minister, he had the singatalur project discontinued, which could be used to store 2 tmcft water to benefit the farmers of tungabhadra ayacut. even drinking water projects and power supply is hanging fire. the government is not ready to direct a private power company located near hagari village, to supply power to bellary city. it produces about 28 mw power, enough to meet the city''s demand. on the other hand, the kptc denies there is any load shedding, though the power situation is serious with no supply from 12 noon to 6 am, reddy said.

17,Gujarat riots delay BSNL mobile launch,"hubli: the bharat sanchar nigam limited (bsnl), which was supposed to go `mobile'' by the month-end, has run into another hurdle. this time, the delay is directly related to the communal frenzy in gujarat, which refuses to die down. the much-hyped mobile telephone services of the bsnl were supposedly a new year gift for hubli-dharwad, but have been dragged to april. as bsnl''s luck would have it, its order for towers placed with a private company in gujarat could not be delivered because riots began. the launch was grounded, or the telecommunication giant would by now have locked horns with private mobile telephone companies in the twin-cities and belgaum. a source in bsnl told the times of india that the new infrastructure to be set up for the new services is in the process of completion. the company is likely to test-launch their services by may-end, but the commercial launch will have to wait for another two months. the initial delay was due to negotiations re-started by the union telecommunication ministry. all the other equipment for setting up the infrastructure has reached hubli and also been commissioned. the contract is being taken up by motorola. only telephone exchanges, power supply systems, air-conditioners and a few towers will be utilised from the existing infrastructure. the bsnl needs 10 more towers, which are an essential component of the infrastructure for the mobile telephone system, and are manufactured only in gujarat and punjab. bsnl had placed its order with a company in gujarat. a team of engineers has already completed the survey work. when compared to other mobile services, bsnl wants to provide a ``total reach'''' facility in the region, and is set to target 10,000 customers in the region. the reach will range from belgaum to bangalore, covering the entire district headquarters along the national highways, where it includes belgaum, gadag, haveri, ranebennur, harihar, chitradurga, davanagere, tumkur and a few taluks too. itc a hit with students the virtual card calling service, branded as the indian telephone card (itc), is slowly catching on in hubli-dharwad. a bsnl source revealed that the itc has become attractive for those who pay around rs 20,000 in telephone bills. ``by utilising itc, they are hoodwinking the tax authorities.'''' others who find the itc attractive are corporate offices, multinationals and those who are on the move and who do not own telephones. in hubli-dharwad, students are finding it handy. the bsnl has provided a telephone at sdm college and kims for the convenience of students using such cards. ``women staying in hostels are now opting for itc so they can make std calls from the telephone provided at the hostel building.'''' the bsnl is now gearing itself to market the cards aggressively __ agents will be appointed and a 5 per cent commission paid. itcs are available in the denominations of rs 105, rs 210, rs 525, rs 1050, rs 2100 and rs 5250.
