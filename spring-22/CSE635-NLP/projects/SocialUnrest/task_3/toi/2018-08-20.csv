10,Last-minute intervention `saved' Cong Dalit rally,"new delhi: the timely intervention of senior congress leaders and chief minister sheila dikshit salvaged the dalit chunauti rally held on august 19. the infighting that had triggered between the dissidents and the loyalists over who would convene the rally, that was addressed by party president sonia gandhi, was doused by kamal nath and dikshit. they had to take the arrangements in their own hands. several outer delhi mlas had opposed the selection of former mla from sultanpuri, jaikishan, as the convenor of the rally. kamal nath, the aicc general secretary in-charge of city congress, was then forced to take reins. with the help of dpcc chief subhash chopra and dikshit, he was able to mobilise the support of both factions. however, for dikshit supporters, the success of the rally proved to be yet another political victory. by retaining jaikishan as the convernor of the rally, and making it successful despite the boycott by several mlas, the loyalists were able to pit the former mla against the dissidents. jaikishan, a dissident leader himself, had recently fallen out of favour from the group. according to sources, the loyalists were able to cash in on this development. ``by supporting jaikishan, they helped him consolidate his hold in outer delhi. he has emerged as a dalit leader. this is likely to work against the dissident group who also have a stronghold in this area,'' said a senior leader. according to sources, had the senior leadership not intervened at the last minute, the rally would have a fiasco. prior to kamal nath's intervention, the mlas of the loyalist faction had refused to cooperate with jaikishan. according to them, jaikishan's alleged involvement in the 1984 riots, for which he was denied the party ticket in the last elections, did not augur well for the party's image. dikshit supporter raj kumar chauhan, a legislator from mongolpuri, had expressed his dissent in the party meeting at dikshit's residence last week. chauhan and other outer delhi mlas including tughlaqabad legislator shishpal, saket mla tek chand sharma, palam mla mahinder yadav, and kanwal singh yadav from nazafgarh did not even participate in the rally. however, the leadership was able to placate other mlas. ``all city ministers and most of the mlas were present in the rally. dikshit could not attend the rally on health grounds. the congress was able to score a point over the opposition by holding two big rallies in last six months. both were addressed by sonia gandhi,'' said a senior leader. as a run up to the municipal corporation polls, the city congress had held the rally to consolidate its dalit base in the city. previously, the party had organised a kisan rally in outer delhi to make inroads into the rural votebank.
