Former Akali ministers get anticipatory bail: Two former Akali ministers Nirmal Singh Kahlon and Sucha Singh Langah, who were fearing arrest in false cases at the behest of the Congress government were granted anticipatory bail by the Punjab and Haryana High Court on Wednesday.

Justice RC Kathuria, while granting the bail, directed the state government to give the petitioners at least seven day''s notice in the event of the lodging of an FIR or issue of arrest warrants.

However, the state counsel said that no case had been registered against the former ministers so far nor were they wanted in any other case.

Both Kahlon and Langah had filed separate anticipatory bail pleas, under section 438 read with 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code, alleging that they had either been or would be implicated in false cases, which was why they needed at least 15 days notice before being arrested.

9,HC lawyers to boycott courts tomorrow,"PATNA: The coordination committee of various lawyersâ€™ associations of the Patna High Court has decided to boycott the courts on Friday in support of the striking lawyers of the Patna City civil court, who are on strike in protest against the delay in filling of the vacancies of judicial officers.

The committee has formed a fact-finding team of lawyers headed by senior advocate Ram Suresh Rai. The other members of the team are Amarendra Kumar, Abhay Singh and Veena Rani Prasad.

The fact-finding committee formed by members of the superseded Bar Council has found the charges against the lawyers relating to the â€œlockingâ€� of City courts to be â€œbaselessâ€�.

Meanwhile, Patna High Court registrar general S Mukherjee, in a press communique on Wednesday, said the presidents of the Barristersâ€™ Association, Lawyersâ€™ Association and Advocatesâ€™ Association, Rana Pratap Singh, Rajendra Prasad Singh and Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, and Yogesh Verma desired to see the Chief Justice â€œafter an appointment on three identified subjectsâ€�.

These were parking place for members of the bar, cleaning of a passage between the Bar Council building and east of the wall of the high court and unveiling of a portrait in the Barristersâ€™ Association.

Justice Nagendra Rai, Justice S N Jha and Justice Shashank Kumar Singh were present in the meeting with the registrar general in attendance.

Meanwhile, the registrar general has said that as and when vacancies in different cadres have arisen, adequate number of judicial officers have been posted. In a press release, he said that void in the â€œlower rung of the judiciary at the munsif level occurred due to implementation of the Union ministry of lawâ€™s directive to appoint subordinate judges in fast-track courtsâ€�.

Polluting vehicles: A division bench of the HC, comprising Justice Nagendra Rai and Justice R S Garg on Wednesday, directed Patna senior SP to stop plying of tractors and trucks carrying uncovered sand, since combined with noxious automobile emission it forms a poisonous cocktail.

Road construction department secretary Shashi Kant Sharma, PRDA vice-chai-rman Chaitanya Prasad, DM Deepak Prasad and Patna senior SP Sunil Kumar were present in the court.

Lawyer Chakrapani gave to the court an NGOâ€™s survey report providing data regarding quality of air in Patna.

10,Calculated policy best option for India,"NEW DELHI: India has reacted to the Jammu massacre with characteristic caution. Fears that the already mobilised Indian Army would be ordered to go to war have not been borne out either by its actions or the statements of the countryâ€™s political leadership.

Though condemnation has been universal, all that the BJP-led government has done is to call for an all-party meeting while the Congress has emphasised there should be no cross-LoC action and steps be taken to pre-empt such events.

The Prime Minister emphasised in the Lok Sabha on Wednesday that the issue is to end terrorism, not seek revenge.

Eleven years after the onset of militancy in Kashmir, Indiaâ€™s options remain limited. Though the USâ€™s global war on terrorism has given New Delhi some comfort, it has not provided any usable payoff in dealing with cross-border terrorism.

Fears that a cross-border Indian strike, regardless of the provocation that occasioned it, could touch off a nuclear conflict remain the dominant factor in Washingtonâ€™s South Asia policy.

No less important is its goal of hunting Osama bin Laden with the help of the Pakistan Army. So all that was to be obtained from US Assistant Secretary Christina Rocca during her two-day visit were some anodyne statements.

In the circumstances, the best option is the hard option, that is to press on with the battle to defeat the armed militancy in the Valley and simultaneously engage disaffected elements in a dialogue towards addressing their grievances.

Since striking across the LoC is neither militarily nor politically feasible, the security forces will have to continue with their efforts to prevent militants from coming across the LoC besides tracking and neutralising those who get across.

Preventing a recurrence of the Jammu-type attack remains the major challenge for intelligence agencies, both civilian and military. It is not easy to stop terrorists who do not hesitate to kill women or children.

But there are some steps that can be taken. Foremost among these is a complete revamp of the system of perimeter security of armed forces and police camps, housing establishments and offices.

Properly-built and sited guard houses, surveillance cameras and floodlights are not expensive, neither are taut-wire sensors and specially trained dogs for patrolling. Some of these things have been done for VIPs, but there is need to â€˜â€˜industrialiseâ€™â€™ the process and make it the norm for all institutions.

Over the years, misplaced priorities led the security forces to seek big-ticket items and ignore the critical equipment required to fight the war on hand â€” the low-intensity conflict unleashed by Pakistan.
