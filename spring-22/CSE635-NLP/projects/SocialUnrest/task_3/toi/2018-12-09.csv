0,Fermented neera flourishes in `no-rule' period,"bangalore: consider this. october 27: the karnataka government allows neera tapping, says rules for it would be framed within a fortnight. november 17: horticulture minister kagodu thimappa announces ban on neera tapping in 12 districts until march 2002 for pesticides spraying to treat coconut mite. december 10: spraying of pesticide to commence on the lines of pulse polio campaign. result: tapping of neera continues in a ``no-rule period'' while the excise and law departments hum and haw over the framing of rules. ``we have made some suggestions, which are being studied by law department,'' excise department sources told the sunday times of india. however, the delay in regulating the neera tapping business has become a cause of concern for the excise department and the arrack contractors. at least in four taluks -- chamarajanagar, mysore, tumkur and hassan (all coconut growing areas) -- re-auction on the right to vend retail arrack had to be held. ``re-auction is done when the contractor does not fulfill the conditions with defaulting on furnishing the bank guarantee being one. but now, neera also became an issue as the rentals expected from the auction dropped with the lower strata of society switching over from arrack to neera consumption,'' sources said. however, the excise department has not quantified the loss to arrack in terms of consumption and revenue. ``there is nothing we can do about the unhygienic manner in which neera is being marketed. this is a no-rule period. a large quantum of unsold neera is now being disposed of in villages after dusk as toddy at a concession,'' sources maintained. at the same time, sources are sceptical over the neera sales regulating, even after the rules are framed. ``we were never in favour of neera tapping. it converts into toddy, which is banned barring four districts. the primary condition -- that only sale of unfermented neera would be allowed -- is likely to be breached,'' they contended. according to karnataka rajya raitha sangha president m.d. nanjundaswamy, 20,000 litres of neera is consumed in each of the 50 taluks in 15 districts everyday. admitting neera is being sold as toddy, he said: ``this is being done by those who are not farmers, to earn profit.'' nanjundaswamy said the sangha was resisting the government's steps to spray pesticides. ``no farmer is willing to poison the coconut tree. the mite attacks the spathe (where neera is tapped). when the spathe is chopped off, mite is eliminated,'' he claimed.

1,BJP to fight elections along with allies: CM,"lucknow: i want to contest the coming vidhan sabha polls from haidergarh and have communicated my wish to the central leadership, said chief minister rajnath singh on saturday at the up press club. speaking at the meet-the-press programme, singh said it all depended on the central leadership whether he would be in the poll fray or not. he said he was against the idea of projecting himself as future chief minister in the event of his party getting an absolute majority. replying to a volley of questions, singh said the coming election will be contested on his government's achievements. he said since vajpayee happened to be the 'head of the government', he had complete faith in him and there was no need to project himself as the future chief minister. at the same time he did not want to be sidelined by the party, he added. when pointed out by newsmen that state president of the bjp kalraj mishra had already projected him as the future chief minister, singh said he would request kalraj not to do so. spelling out issues for the polls, he said that the bjp would contest the election on 'stability, development and internal security'. singh reiterated that if poto was not passed by parliament, a similar bill would be brought in uttar pradesh to deal terrorism with a firm hand. when newsmen wanted to know about the cases of terrorism in uttar pradesh, singh said he did not remember the exact number, but there were many. on being reminded by newsmen about the critical remarks made by the national human rights' commission and also by the scheduled caste and scheduled tribes commission that cases of atrocity were highest in uttar pradesh, singh quipped: perhaps you do not remember the percentage. on alliance with the supporting parties, singh said his party would have an electoral understanding with the allies, including rastriya lok dal headed by union minister ajit singh. he said seats would be shared with them on the basis of an agreed formula which would be decided in consultation with the leaders of the friendly parties. he said that even if his party won an absolute majority, he would include the allies' representatives in the ministry. when asked by newsmen about haryana chief minister om prakash chautala's expressed desire to put up candidates in up, he said he would not like to comment on it. singh said the bjp would also have a tie-up with the janata dal (u), led by sharad yadav. on ram janmbhoomi, singh said it should was not be made an issue for the polls. he said the opposition parties made it a poll issue solely to take political advantage out of it by creating suspicion in the minds of the muslims. singh said he was confident the vexed problem would be resolved by march 12 as has been promised by prime minister vajpayee. in the meantime, security had been tightened at ayodhya, he added. on kalyan singh, singh termed him as his elder brother but expressed confidence that he would not be able to damage the cause of the bjp.

2,'National health policy seeks to privatise healthcare',"pune: several city-based health activists have decried the draft bill of the national health policy, 2001 and have joined hands with their accomplices across the country to oppose it tooth-and nail. free or subsidised medicare at public hospitals could well become a thing of the past as the government is all set to pass the national health policy, 2001. the bill has come after a gap of 17 years, but some health activists have termed it as anti-people, lacking in vision and a complete sell-out to the private sector. according to dr anant phadke, a leading health activist, who is also a member of the jan arogya abhiyan, a nationwide platform with almost 2,000 health organisations, the bill in the present context is not acceptable particularly in a place like pune which has a sizeable population living below the poverty line. ""it will have serious repercussions on all the over 15 lakh odd people living below the poverty line,"" he said, adding that it will only add to the misery of the poor. ""the situation is all the more grim in maharashtra as all eyes are now set on the us$ 134 million world bank loan on health care reforms,"" alleged dr abhay shukla, terming the proposed bill as a tacit ploy by the centre to allow complete privatisation of health facilities. ""ironically, neither the state government nor the central council of health and family welfare were consulted while framing the draft bill,"" he said. according to audrey fernandes from the bharat gyan vigyan samuday, there are several lacunas in the draft bill, the most important being that there is no mention about the population control programme. instead it says that the population boom is responsible for lack of improvement in health standards! fernandes says the draft is practically silent about the pharmaceutical policy and its impact on health care. ""the new policy being discussed by the industry ministry has reportedly recommended further relaxation of drug production and price controls. does it mean that increased drug prices and non-availability of essential drugs have no impact on the health sector?"" dr phadke said the draft has a very ""inadequate"" section on women's health. ""child health too is dealt with in passing. it is silent on child nutrition though half of the children below the age of five years are malnourished in the country, a dubious distinction that india shares with only one other country (bangladesh) in the world!"" similarly, the health needs of the elderly and the handicapped are hardly addressed in the draft, he pointed out. dr shukla alleged that the draft is framed to serve the interests of urban specialist-based health care with no thought to the needs of primary care and no mention of community health workers. ""the government has also preferred to be mum on capitation-fee charged by private medical colleges,"" he said, adding that even the research section on the draft bill has no mention of the need to strenghten the country's public health system. it may be recalled that eminent virologist dr jacob john, along with other leading physicians from across the country, who were in the city recently, had advocated the need to strenghten the public health system to fight both known and unknown diseases.

4,People's War and terror law,"hyderabad: with the people's war group (pwg) — the most militant outfit operational in andhra pradesh — included in the list of terrorist organisations under poto, police officials engaged in counter-extremist activities in the state are fearing greater violence from the pwg cadres in exchange for little gains. the pwg and its frontal organisations are already banned by the state government and police forces are in hot pursuit of the naxalite cadre, who use the dense forests as their hideout. the andhra pradesh police are presently acting under the ap security act, which unlike poto, has limited provisions to check the naxal group's activities. under poto people providing shelter, food and funds to the naxals can be arrested and tried. the naxal outfit has been maintaining it cannot be equated with terrorist groups as it has a clear political ideology and goals, but the mindless destruction wrought by the cadres prove otherwise. pwg has a very systematic network of couriers, who work as the backbone for the naxalite group and has also developed an excellent support mechanism, be it in the administration, police or media, to air its viewpoints. hundreds of professional revolutionaries (prs) — those who sympathise with naxals, but take up some other job as a cover — form part of this network. though the police could to an extent break the courier network of naxalites and manage to infiltrate ""renegades"" into the underground cadre, they have failed in breaking the pr system. with poto, the police intend to control the prs. it is believed that for some time now the police had stopped arresting naxalites as the extremists in turn kidnapped senior ias officers and politicians to secure the release of their cadres. with the result, the number of fake encounters are on rise in the state. poto is unlikely to change the situation. hoewever, police sources adds that bringing pwg under poto would affect the group's plans to forge a unity among the several cpi(ml) naxalite groups in the country. a few years ago the people's war group, operating in andhra pradesh, and parts of orissa, maharashtra and chattisgarh, merged with party unity of bihar and became a formidable force in both bihar and jharkhand. the resurgent group even entered into a truce with the maoist communist centre (mcc) in bihar, posing further challenge to the law enforcement agencies.

""they do not have any solution so far on the issue of the construction of ram temple"", he added. the sp supremo said that if the prime minister had spoken to the people of the two communities on the issue, he should disclose the names of those people with whom he had conversed. to another question, yadav said his party would not have any political alliance with congress in the forthcoming uttar pradesh assembly elections and added that the party would amicably adjust seats with allies.

12,Sangha wants sugarcane development fund,"hubli: president of karnataka rajya raitha sangha puttanaiah demanded that a sugarcane development fund be established in the state to stabilise the market and improve production of sugar. he told reporters the government does not have any moral grounds to ban the export of sugarcane to the neighbouring states. according to him, when the government cannot interfere and increase the crushing capacity in the aftermath of the increased cane production, it cannot put a ban on sugar export. puttanaiah pointed out that it is the neighbouring states which were buying the surplus sugarcane from the state all these years. puttanaiah was referring to the cane growers of belgaum district demanding that the government lift the export ban. the cane from the border district was transported to maharashtra all these years as the district was witnessing surplus cane production. this year, the sugar mills are running short of cane supply and recently approached the government to stop the farmers from exporting it to maharashtra. he said that half of the sugar mills in the state were in a bad financial condition as the sugar produced was not being lifted and also about rs 4 crore payment was pending. ``when this is the situation,'' he said, ``the government has given 16 licences to start new sugar mills.'' puttanaiah was of the opinion that the government should think on the lines of adopting a technology to preserve and sell cane juice. this will be another alternative for the cane growers and there will be no total dependency on sugar and jaggery production. ""producing softdrinks from cane will be a viable alternative to all the soft drinks that are produced by multinationals,'' he added. ``a scientific and indigenous crop and agricultural policy is not in the consideration of the government,'' he rued and added ""in fact, this has created a situation for the farmers to commit suicide.'' he argued farmers' deaths were not mainly due to price fall and crop loss but also due to unfriendly government policies.
