0,"Some brides are ‘villains’, not victims: lawyers","KOLKATA: City lawyers claim to be surprised at the spate of â€˜patently unfairâ€™ cases alleging cruelty to the bride under section 498A of the Indian Penal Code, which is a cognizable and non-bailable offence offence meaning that the police can arrest without warrants and bails can be obtained only from a law court and not the police station.

They are also surprised to come across many cases which, they feel, are brazenly fabricated and amount to a gross abuse of a legal provision.

Once a woman lodges a complaint, the arrest of the husband is virtually routine. And if he happens to be a government servant or working in a public sector undertaking or bank, his suspension follows again as a routine.

In some cases lawyers have been appalled to find elderly relatives of the husband and even visiting relatives of the husband implicated in the case.

In some cases the husband and his family are virtually being blackmailed into coughing up money and reach an out-of-court settlement.

In one of the cases the bride is said to have won the heart of her in-laws so much that when her sister-in-law gets married, all the family jewellery are put in her lockers.

She takes the jewellery, leaves the house and promptly lodges a complaint against her husband.

Inquiries revealed that she had an earlier affair and had left to live with her love, recalls Ananda Basu, Advocate practising in the Calcutta High Court.

Eminent lawyer Bishnu Charan Ghosh says, â€œAs a lawyer I have never come across such gross abuse of any of the provisions of any Act as I am experiencing in 498A IPC casesâ€�.

He goes on to say, â€œI donâ€™t mean to suggest that brides are always the villains and not the victim. In a majority of the cases, in fact, the brides are at the receiving end. But what is surprising is the large number of cases where the brides actually seem to be villainousâ€�.

Asked about the ways to check abuse of section 498A, B.C.

Ghosh and Gitanath Ganguly, the former suggests a threefold measure: (i) to convert section 498A into a bailable one, (ii) The Ld. court could carefully consider whether the allegations of the bride are indeed genuine at least against the in-laws or other relations of her husband when it directs investigation under section 156(3) of CrPC for an offence under section 498A and, (iii) The Ld. court could carefully take into account whether custodial detention is at all needed for the old in-laws and other relations.

Ganguly suggests that on receiving a complaint under section 498A from a woman, police should immediately approach the Magistrate instead of arresting the accused.

He asserted that the police should collect the materials, place them before the Magistrate and arrest people only with the permission of the Magistrate. He also suggests making the offence under this section a bailable one.

The lawyers also point out the irony that while women belonging to the poorer sections, for whom the section was primarily meant, are not even aware of the provision, the section is being merrily misused by a section of the urban women.

1,Villagers take minister to task,"RAJKOT: Minister of state for rural development Mohan Kundaria was taken to task by the people at Tankara as they get water once in 15 days. Kundaria had to beat a hasty retreat as he was unable to face them.

Incidentally Padhadhari-Tankara is his constituency. So the voters asked him: if Rajkot could be given water for 15 days in a month why did Padhadhari and Tankara get water just once in 15 days.

The minister had gone to the village to solve their problems on the spot. What''s worse, he cut a sorry figure in front of the district officials.

The crowd was not ready to listen to Kundaria who said ""the region has been covered under the sector reform and that Tankara would get water from the Narmada canal. Then their problems would be solved. Besides, the people would also be paid Rs 1250 under the sector reform scheme"". However the people were in no mood to listen to him.

Even the officials had no answer to the people''s queries.

2,"NGOs stage rally, court arrest","VADODARA: A group of NGOs in the city, Vadodara Shanti Abhiyan, staged a rally against the ''unjust'' police action on Muslims. A group of ''Shaheedi jathas'' comprising 27 women and 25 men courted arrest on Tuesday morning, said Jagdish Shah of the Abhiyan.

""The police have embarked on a mission to harass the minority community in the old city area. In the name of combing, they have harassed women and men and entered homes at night and lathi-charged them and arrested innocents. We are telling the police ''we''ll make your job easier. Instead of you having to come to our house to attack us, we''ll come to you so that they can kill us'',"" said Ishaqbhai Chinwala, a Savodaya member and part of the VSA.

""The police detained 27 women and 29 men today. But on Wednesday we''ll repeat the programme"", said Trupti Shah.

3,Ice-cream sales fall due to riots,"AHMEDABAD: Shruti Srivastva, 15, is a dissappointed teen-ager these days. First riots dashed her hopes to spend the summer vacations at a hill station. Now her parents have banned her frequent visit to a nearby ice-cream parlour in the evenings.

Despite staying at Thaltej, a relatively safe area that remained immune to violence, Shruti can not venture out to relish her favourite ice-reams these days.

""I have to satisfy myself with whatever my parents get for me,"" she rues complaining about lack of choice and the thrill she used to get out of venturing out into the night for a post-dinner dessert.

For the past two months, a large section of Amdavadis are missing their late night outings. And, as a direct fallout, the ice-cream sector has begun to feel the heat. Though the temperature has touched 45 degrees, summer sales for big companies have slid down.

The air of insecurity in the city, the night curfew in riot-hit areas and the early closure of shops even in relatively peaceful areas has hit business. And in Ahmedabad, considered the ice-cream capital of the country, sales of the frozen dessert have dipped in peak season.

Ahmedabad has one of the highest per capita consumption in the country gobbling at 250 ml as against the national per capita consumption of 106 ml. The state owes high level of ice-cream consumption to high temperature, overall affluence and disposable income because of prohibition and a matter of habit among Gujaratis.

""There was a severe impact on impulse buying due to tense situation in Ahmedabad,"" says R S Sodhi, General Manager (Marketing), Gujarat Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation (GCMMF) selling Amul brand of ice-creams. Gujarat constitutes 35 per cent of the total ice-cream market in India has suffered at least 15 per cent loss in sales due to riots and tense situation which continues in several parts of the state.

Amul, instead has changed its strategy to cover up the losses by keeping a focus on brick (family pack) sales. ""We have reduced price of a brick from Rs 100 to Rs 60 so that people buy it during day time and consume it in the nights when they cannot come out,"" says Sodhi.

However, local brands like Havmor have also decided to cover the losses focussing on the other cities which have relatively remained peaceful. ""We are focussing on Surat to cover up lossses in Ahmedabad,"" says Pradeep Chona, Director, Havmor Ice Cream Company. Direct losses of Rs 50 lakhs were suffered by 97 outlets after they were burnt in post-Godhra riots.

All the big companies have already lost 35 per cent sales this season. Riots really played spoilsport for the ice-cream sector as it put spanner on sales despite long summer days, school vacation and a wedding season.

""After losing two crucial months we are expecting good business in May but everything depends on situation at that time,"" says S Keraleeyan, deputy product manager, Vadilal Ice-creams.

5,Compensation to farmers: Bungling to be investigated,"FEROZEPUR: D K Tiwari, deputy commissioner, Ferozepur, has ordered an enquiry into irregularities in the allocation and distribution of compensation to farmers of border areas under Ferozepur district, whose land had come under mines and other military activities following amassing of Indian troops near the international border.

It may be recalled that the district administration had received Rs 18 crore to compensate farmers of the border villages after a survey had been carried out by the revenue department. However, farmers complained that the revenue patwari with the help of sarpanches of border areas had manipulated records of survey to suit their interest.

Tiwari told The Times of India that some farmers had approached his office to highlight certain irregularities in land surveys and in the distribution of compensation.

While admitting anomalies in the survey and in the distribution of compensation, the deputy commissioner said that a fresh survey had been ordered and strict legal action would be taken against the culprits.

6,'Dhumal govt manipulated hydro-electric projects',"SHIMLA: Him Loktantric Morcha convenor Mahender Singh, on Tuesday, accused the H P government of altering the criteria for allotting the various hydro-electric projects in the state, in order to favour certain parties, who otherwise would be no where in the reckoning.

He said that criteria adopted in the year 2000 for allotment of eight projects and subsequently in 2001 for nine projects was that the HPSEB gave assessment out of 80 marks and the high powered committee out of 20.

These marks were then added to draw a shortlist of bidders and the cabinet thereafter approved the successful bidder, he added. Singh alleged, ""The marks given by the HPSEB had been ignored by the committee in drawing up the shortlist presented to the cabinet.""

Claiming that the change in criteria had been adopted to favour companies which would not otherwise qualify on merit, he said that the interests of the state could not be safeguarded, if merit was not the criteria for awarding projects for development in the private sector.

Singh said that even foreign companies were applying pressure to get projects, and in the year 2000, out of eight five projects had been allotted to them.

7,Transport industry hit by violence,"AHMEDABAD: If there is one industry that shatters the myth of normalcy the Gujarat government is trying to project after two months of communal violence, it is the transport industry. Ever since riots broke out, transporters have found themselves in one of the lowest ebbs of their business cycles as they rely heavily on Muslims to keep their wheels turning.

The minority community has a large presence here, both as drivers and in the ancillary industries and most of them have refused to return to work fearing for their lives even after two months.

The villages with a large Muslim population often have rampant unemployment. When one of them succeeds as a trucker, he invites others from the community to join the trade.

With communal violence continuing in the state, Muslims have chosen to stick to their safe havens, not venturing on to the roads. Large transporters now say it will take them years to get back on to their feet if the community does not return to work quickly.

Muslims are the â€˜â€˜oxygenâ€™â€™ of the transport industry nationally. Nearly 50 per cent of the truckers come from the community. Even among Hindu-owned transport companies in Gujarat, 40 per cent have a large number of Muslim drivers.

Among ancillary businesses, like garages, batteries and wind shields, the presence of Muslims is more than 60 per cent. Most of these small businesses have refused to open shop, breaking the back of the industry.

â€˜â€˜Of 50 vehicles, I have managed to put barely 15 back on the road,â€™â€™ says Nimesh Patel, honorary secretary of the Akhil Gujarat Truckers Association.

â€˜â€˜My drivers are asking for extra security, but how can I vouch for their lives on the highway. Anything can happen there and I canâ€™t be held responsible for that.â€™â€™

A large number of Patelâ€™s Muslim drivers are from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar who have not reported back to work since the violence started.

There are others like Narendra Patel, who has only three of his 30 vehicles on the road, despite having accounts with large consumer companies like BPL, Samsung and Godrej GE.

â€˜â€˜Drivers apart, you canâ€™t even have a cracked windshield replaced because most of them are Muslims,â€™ says Mukesh Dave, another exasperated transporter.

â€˜â€˜To have a leaking radiator repaired, you sometimes have to join a waiting list of a couple of days, something no transporter can afford. Even the puncture-wallas are Muslims!â€™â€™

The community is so pervasive in the industry that they even control the highway hotels in the state.

As Dave puts it, â€˜â€˜The owners would not only provide every possible object to a trucker, from food to a nail-cutter, they would also ensure security for the trucks. That support system is gone now.â€™â€™

8,Three killed in Gujarat violence,"AHMEDABAD/VADODARA: Three persons, two in Vadodara and one in Ahmedabad, were killed in continuing clashes in Gujarat late on Monday night. In Ahmedabad, one person was killed in police firing in the Ranip area of Sabarmati when an irate mob set a plastic factory on fire which led to stone-throwing.

Interestingly, the police fired only seven rounds at Sabarmati in which two persons were injured of which one died and three others were injured by teargas shells and stones. Explosions continued in the Bakar Ali ni Pol area of Kalupur through the night where one person was seriously injured.

The police firing on mobs clashing in the Taiwada area of Vadodara left two dead on Monday night. A large mob had gathered at Taiwada in the Panigate police station area and resorted to heavy stone pelting around 1.30 a.m. on Tuesday. The police lobbed several teargas shells initially but when the mob refused to disperse, they opened fire.

Tension mounted in the area after the police refused to allow the mob to take away the bodies of the two slain men fearing that this might escalate trouble in the area. Around 2 a.m., an ambulance was called, but it could not enter Taiwada because the situation was extremely tense. The bodies were, however, finally brought to the SSG hospital.

In another violent incident in Vadodara, six persons were injured in police firing at Bhandwada and another was wounded by a teargas shell near Panchmukhi Hanuman temple at Karelibaug. Of the 25 injured admitted to hospital following communal violence, the condition of at least four was stated to be critical.

The police also arrested 40 Muslim women, who took out a rally through the main thoroughfares of the city to protest against the government and the policeâ€™s alleged failure to contain violence and attacks on the minority community in the city.

The slogan-shouting protesters, led by veteran journalist Kirit Bhatt, under the banner of the Baroda Shanti Samiti, were taken into custody at Nyaya Mandir as tension mounted in the city.

9,Spotlight on princely ‘riches’,"PUNE: Currency notes and coins from nearly 700 erstwhile princely states in the country will share the limelight with recently unearthed earthen coins from ancient China and Thailand at a three-day exhibition organised by the Numismatic Society of Maharashtra (NSM) at Bharat English school from May 4.

Addressing a press conference on Tuesday, Devdutta Angal, secretary of the local unit of NSM said coins and currency notes of euros, the latest currency in the world, will also be on display at the show, which will remain open from 9.30 am to 7 pm on all the three days.

The society has been holding similar shows in the city for the last ten years.

In recognition of NSMâ€™s work, the department of post and telegraph has come out with a special cover depicting coins from Shivajiâ€™s era and his stamp.The cover will be released on the first day of the exhibition on May 4 at 10.30 am.

Among the other attractions at the show is a one-paisa note, which looks like a railway ticket, and notes made from cardboard. On display will be stamps and receipts having photographs of erstwhile Indian princes, Angal said.

About the earthen currency Angal said, China and Thailand turned to earthen coins due to shortage of metals. â€œAmong the exhibits are coins which were recovered only recently,â€� he said. Another interesting coin at the exhibition is the rare Shivshahi cut by Shivaji which, incidentally, is from Angalâ€™s personal collection.

11,YSR’s Janmabhoomi remark irks minister,"HYDERABAD: Taking strong objection to Congress Legislature Party leader Y S Rajasekhara Reddyâ€™s criticism of Janmabhoomi, panchayat raj minister P Srinivas Reddy on Tuesday demanded that the opposition leader tender a public apology for criticising the â€˜people-oriented programmeâ€™.

â€œThe opposition leaderâ€™s comparison of Janmabhoomi with a recreation club serving the TDP men is highly objectionable. He is probably not aware about the difference between a recreation club and Janmabhoomi, a programme launched with a noble cause,â€� he said.

Speaking to reporters, Reddy said that criticising Janmabhoomi only amounted to insulting the motherland. He recalled that even Rajasekhara Reddy along with his mother and Cuddapah MP Y Vivekananda Reddy participated in the Janmabhoomi works on June 2 last year.

The Janmabhoomi programme was appreciated by President K R Narayanan and even several Congress leaders also appreciated the conduct of gram sabhas.

Stating that the programme was being implemented in different states including the Congress-ruled states like Karnataka and Rajasthan although with different names, he said that the Congress leaders in the state were worried about the programme as it would help create awareness among the people on various issues.

â€œThey want to scrap the programme for the sake of power. But the people have rejected them in 1999 and they would reject the Congress in the next elections too if it continues criticising the Janmabhoomi programme,â€� he asserted.

To a question, he said that the nodal officers overseeing the Janmabhoomi programme were only acting as coordinators for taking up works and they had no special powers over the village administration.

The allegation that the central funds were being diverted was also incorrect, the minister said.

12,Future riots to be fought over water,"JAIPUR: The desert state of Rajasthan is getting drier with each passing day. To arrest the alarming fall in the level of ground water, a Delhi-based NGO, Stree Shakti The Parallel Force, organised a workshop on effective water management in Rajasthan in collaboration with the state unit of the Confederation of Indian Industry on Tuesday.

N L Kedia, member of the CIIâ€™s state council, said at the meet: The situation is grave and unless steps are taken immediately, things may get out of hand.

Rekha Mody, founder of the NGO, said an interface of industry, NGOs and educational institutions in each village was a must to solve the problem. The problem is grave but some concerted action can solve it, she said. Magsaysay award winner Rajendra Singh warned that in future, water shortage could lead to riots. While people suffer a great deal, even the industry loses money at such times.

Why not spend a few thousand to save crores of rupees, the activists asked.

CIIâ€™s head of the state office Rameshwar Prakash said the confederation had issued circulars to its members asking them to start harvesting water.

While the meet, that was sponsored by the Lakshmangarh-based Modi Institute of Education and Research (MIER), was supposed to be a CII show, neither the industry nor the state government showed much enthusiasm in solving the problem. In fact, when the Central Ground Water Board directorâ€™s name was called out, he had already left the venue. NGOs took most of the initiative at the meet. A majority of the speakers were representatives of NGOs that were doing a lot of work in the state.

Commenting on the official apathy, the chief engineer of a leading five- star hotel here said the state government agencies cannot even make proper plans for water-harvesting.

â€˜â€˜In fact, when we had to do a survey of our hotel for examining its harvesting potential, a team of Sulabh technicians was called from Delhi,â€™â€™ he added. Defending the industry, Prakash said: While there may not be many industrialists present here, Kedia represents the entire state unit of the CII.

He said a portion of the CIIâ€™s news letter will be reserved for issues related to water. â€˜â€˜We will also help any person who wishes to harvest rain water by directing him or her to the right agencies,â€™â€™ he added.

13,"Let us rise above party politics, says Vajpayee","NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee announced a Rs 150 crore rehabilitation package for riot-hit Gujarat but made a strong appeal to all parties to rise above narrow politics in the interests of the nation.

""It is not a question of majority and minority. The country''s existence and honour are at stake. If India comes first, then let us all rise.

""The leader of Opposition Sonia Gandhi in her speech appealed to me to rise above party politics. I respect her sentiments. I want to rise above politics but I cannot do it alone. Sonia Gandhi has also to rise with me,"" Vajpayee said in his 25-minute intervention in the marathon 16-hour debate in Lok Sabha.""

He maintained that had the Sabarmati Express incident been condemned in one voice, the subsequent violence could have been avoided. He accused the Opposition of not allowing the House to function on that day. However, he also admitted his failure in getting a unanimous resolution passed by the House on the Godhra incident.

CPM leader Somnath Chatterjee and Congress member Priyaranjan Dasmunsi were quick on their feet in telling the Prime Minister that he could still move such a motion. Sonia Gandhi too, agreed with them.

Attacking the media for its role in coverage of the Gujarat violence, Vajpayee said there is need for serious self-introspection by the media. Repeated telecasts of gruesome riot scenes ashould be banned and the community of those killed in riots should not be pointed out because it pomoted communalism, the Prime Minister said.

The Prime Minister also refuted the Opposition accusation that he kept changing his statements. His remarks on Islam and Muslims were the same in Gujarat as well as in Goa. He had never made any discrimination on caste or communal lines, and such baseless charges were meant to ruin his image, he said.

He recalled his Goa speech, and said there were two forms of Islam -- one that preached compassion, tolerance, harmony and the path to truth and peace and the other that spread hatred and terror in the name of jehad. He also stated that Hindutva should be liberal and not narrow.

He described what he saw in Gujarat during his visit as ""madness"".

He lamented the atrocities on women, saying: ""Rapists do not feel ashamed and the society does not condemn it. If this disease is not not checked, it will affect our society and culture. This is a new crisis."" However, he also said that a women''s delegation which had recently visited Gujarat had conveyed to the Government that reports of atrocities on women during the disturbances were blown out of proportion.
