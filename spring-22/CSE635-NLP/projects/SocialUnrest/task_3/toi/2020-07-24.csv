0,Ex-armymen call for law against misuse of fatigues,"PUNE: The city-based Initiative for Peace and Disarmament (Inpad), an association of retired army officers, on Thursday urged the Union government to enact a law to punish the unauthorised use, possession and sale of dress material resembling army and police uniforms.

Referring to the July 22 killing near Jammu of a brigadier and the attack on Northern Army commander Lt. Gen. Hari Prasad and two other senior officials by militants in army fatigues, Inpad said the incident highlighted the blatant misuse of army uniform by terrorists.

â€œFrom the Chattisingpora massacre to the Kaluchak carnage, this (misuse of army fatigues) has been one common factor in the modus operandi of the terrorists,â€� Inpad members said in a press release here. The statement has been signed by several former high-ranking defence personnel, including foundermember of the Indian Armyâ€™s college of combat at Mhow, Indore, Lt. Gen. Eric Vas, Lt. Gen. Ashok Joshi, Major Gen. S.C.N. Jatar,Major Gen. Keshav Pendse and Col. Anil Athale.

It said that a person carrying weapons in civilian clothes would attract attention immediately, but since terrorists use army uniform, they escape attention. â€œNot just terrorists, but many private organisations too openly copy the services uniform with impunity,â€� the release said, adding that all this leads to the dilution of army prestige and creates confusion among people. Underlining the importance of enacting a stringent law to prevent the misuse of services uniforms, the release urged parliamentarians to realise the gravity of the situation and take adequate steps.

The association has suggested the use of hi-tech hologram-based badges to make copying services uniforms difficult. According to the release, a similar request was made to the Centre two years ago. â€œUnfortunately, no action has been taken so far,â€� Inpad co-ordinator Col. Anil Athale said.

2,"Talk Tehelka, get George back, Cong tells govt","NEW DELHI: The Congress on Thursday said it would discontinue its boycott of defence minister George Fernandes if the government was willing to debate the Tehelka issue.

The Opposition, led by the Congress, has been boycotting Fernandes ever since he was reinducted into the Union cabinet in November 2001 without being exonerated by the Tehelka commission.

The Congress had declared that it would not recognise the minister, and hence, would not put questions to him or listen to him. Now, the Congress is ready for a debate so that â€˜â€˜the issue is talked outâ€™â€™ of Parliament even if the party gains little after long months of boycott.

In fact, in the last Parliament session, the party had taken disciplinary action against one of its members who had participated in a Lok Sabha debate on MiG crashes. Now, the party has taken a U-turn and underlined that the â€˜â€˜essence is that the House should have a debate on tehelkaâ€™â€™.

Asked whether the party initiated the boycott just for a parliamentary debate or on the principle that Fernandes should not be reinducted into the cabinet until the commission gave its report, party spokesman Jaipal Reddy said: â€˜â€˜Every political issue has a life span. We have exhausted it and now we have to look for parliamentary devices.â€™â€™

The Congress has not consulted other Opposition parties and it remains to be seen whether Fernandesâ€™ regional rival, Laloo Prasad Yadavâ€™s RJD and the Left parties, would agree to a â€˜â€˜you agree to a debate, weâ€™ll lift the boycottâ€™â€™ formula.

The Congress had actually derailed the earlier Venkataswami commission of inquiry into the tehelka expose by accusing Justice K Venkataswami of accepting another office of profit while conducting the tehelka probe.

Justice Venkataswami had consistently opposed former Samata Party chief Jaya Jaitlyâ€™s plea of forensic examination of the tehelka tapes.

9,Maruti expects 55 pc increase in exports,"NEW DELHI: India''s newly listed car giant, Maruti Udyog Ltd, expects a 55 per cent jump in export volumes in the fiscal year to March 2004 as it drives into new markets with its Alto hatchback car.

The country''s biggest carmaker has also drawn up plans to significantly boost local sales of its Alto and Wagon R compact cars and the Versa multi-purpose vehicle this year, it said in its annual report, obtained by Reuters on Thursday.

Maruti, 54.2 per cent owned by Japan''s Suzuki Motor Corp, completed a hugely successful IPO in June. It has been pushing to boost sales after three sluggish years and is cutting costs aggressively to boost profitability.

""The Alto has been a tremendous success in Europe with more than 19,000 units firm orders till August 2003 in hand,"" the company said in the report, adding Algeria and Bangladesh had also been good potential markets.

""We will be commencing exports to Middle East and Far East Asian countries and therefore the outlook for 2003/04 is very bright when we hope to touch even bigger sales of 50,000 units.""

Maruti''s exports nearly trebled in 2002/03 (April-March) to 32,240 units thanks to the success of the Alto in Europe.

The New Delhi-based automaker also said it had drawn up an ambitious growth plan to boost sales of the Wagon R by 56 per cent this year, of the Alto by 94 per cent and to treble sales of Versa, the multi-purpose vehicle.

Maruti sold about 32,000 units of the Wagon R in 2002/03, 26,000 units of the Alto and nearly 2,000 Versas. All the three models have were introduced in the past three-and-a-half years.

It said the higher sales will be achieved by making car financing more available in India through a tie-up with the country''s top commercial bank, the State Bank of India (SBI), and giving more incentives to dealers to sell cars.

SBI controls 20 per cent of India''s banking business and has a network of 9,000 branches across the country.

Maruti sees higher sales of the Wagon R, Alto and the Versa as crucial to boosting profitability since it has invested heavily in making these products locally.

Its vehicles sales rocketed 47.4 per cent in the first fiscal quarter to June 30 to 104,017 units, doing much better than its forecast of a 10 per cent rise in annual sales in 2003/04 made at the start of the fiscal year.

10,Cong flays govt for extending term of co-ops,"HYDERABAD: The Congress has criticised the state cabinet for approving an ordinance to extend the term of the cooperative societies by three more years.

PCC spokesman Gali Muddukrishnama Naidu told reporters on Thursday that the state government had paralysed the cooperative sector by not holding elections to the primary agriculture cooperative societies for the last 11 years.

""The government finds time to hold elections to education committees for schools, water user committees, but has no time to hold PACS polls,"" he said.

Naidu alleged that the Chief Minister was not holding the elections to the cooperative societies because he was threatened at the prospects of the ruling TDP in the elections.

11,Naidu pulls up erring govt officials,"HYDERABAD: Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu on Thursday pulled up officials of the agriculture department for coming for a video conference without the necessary home work.

Naidu threatened to suspend even senior officials if they continued to play truant and not follow the instructions of the head of the department.

The Chief Minister''s outbursts came after a number officials designated as escort executive for each crop and crop specialists failed to turn up at the video conference Naidu had with district collectors over agriculture-related subjects on Thursday.

Naidu was particularly upset with a couple of agriculture scientists who told him that they had joined duty just a day before and hence, did not have any information on the cropping pattern in the state.

He asked agriculture secretary S P Singh to initiate action against the erring officials.

Later, the Chief Minister said that deficit rainfall was reported in Anantapur, Karimnagar and Srikakulam and asked the officials to suggest better crops in such districts.

Naidu also reviewed employment generation, Neeru-Meeru, minority welfare and welfare of the disadvantaged groups with the district collectors.

He asked the officials to concentrate on rain water harvesting methods and enlighten the public about the need to harvest water for future requirements.

He also sought explanation from municipal administration principal Tishya Chatterjee and director Sri Lakshmi, who left the video conference after an initial session on health, without informing him.

Probably for the first time, no minister was present at the five-hour long video conference the Chief Minister had from Secretariat.

Health Minister N Janardhan Reddy participated in the conference from Guntur, while Panchayat Raj Minister appeared from Mahbubnagar. Excise Minister T Seetaram joined from Srikakulam, while Civil Supplies Minister C Mutyam Reddy was seen sitting next to Medak district collector.

The state government has earmarked Rs 1,280 crore to support the shift in crop pattern. ""We have already started with the basmati crop and are now moving towards pulses and oilseeds. These are high value produces but the margins are lower for the farmer. So, we are filling the shortfall for the farmer with this fund,"" Singh added.

14,Sinha clarifies Chinese incursions,"NEW DELHI: External Affairs minister Yashwant Sinha told the Lok Sabha on Friday that the government had taken up with China the issue of incursions by its troops in Arunachal Pradesh, which had arisen as a result of ""differring perceptions"" of the two countries on the Line of Actual Control.

The 1996 agreement on confidence-building measures in areas of defence, Sinha pointed out, contains specific provisions on how to deal with face-to-face contact between the troops of the two countries.

These provisions had not been observed in the latest Chinese incursion into the Asafila area of Arunachal Pradesh on June 26, 2003. He added that differences on the LAC took place from time to time because the ""process of clarification"" was still on.

Sinha was speaking on behalf of the government, responding to the Opposition''s demand for an adjournment motion on the subject.

The adjournment motion was finally rejected by Speaker Manohar Joshi, but not before the Samajwadi Party''s Ramjilal Suman stressed that relations with China was a sensitive issue which demanded more than a statement by the Prime Minister on his recent visit to that country.

The Congress''s JS Brar observed that the PM''s trip to Lahore had been followed by the Kargil episode and his recent trip to China, by the recent incursions in Arunachal, and wanted to know if the government had a policy on national security.

16,Assam govt rice sell-off scheme boomerangs,"GUWAHATI: The Assam government''s first ever effort to protect rice farmers by ensuring them a better price from the Food Corporation of India (FCI) has strayed away from the target triggering off a price escalation of rice in the open market.

With the FCI agreeing to procure the surplus summer crop at the minimum support price (MSP) of Rs 530 per quintal fixed by the government, the farmers were ensured that they would not have to go for any distress sale. In the absence of any agency in the past farmers were at the mercy of the middlemen and had to sell their surplus production at much lower price.

However, traders, who fear losing the product to FCI have started buying the rice at Rs 500 quintal from the farmers. The farmers on the other hand, who have been receiving just Rs 200 per quintal in the past are only too happy to sell it at Rs 500 right at their homes instead of the coming to the market and spending on transportation.

According to the scheme, FCI after procuring the rice at the MSP would sell it back to state at the existing subsidized rate. But, with the traders selling it in the open market instead of giving it to FCI has resulting into a price escalation, the minister said.

""As this is the first time there are some loopholes in the system. The farmers are aware of the government''s minimum support price but traders have started moving into the villages and purchasing the rice at Rs 500 per quintal,"" state food and civil supplies minister Dr Nazrul Islam told TNN.

""But this price escalation would soon be negated as the above poverty line (APL) rice, which no one was lifting because of its higher price but lower than the escalated price.""

The minister admitted that since the scheme was launched with little time in hand all sides could not be examined properly. ""The government would also ensure that every rice miller would have to purchase the paddy from the market and obtain a certificate from the local administration.""

""We will be having the same scheme for the winter crops and so we have decided to start the preparation right away so as to make the scheme free of any loophole."" The state''s monthly allotment of APL rice is 39,000 MT and is priced at less than Rs 9 per kg.

Inaugurating a two-day NCP state leadership training camp here, he called upon the party workers to put in more efforts and work hard to enable the party play an important role in national politics.

Congress was facing acute confusion on the leadership issue, which had not happened in the past, he said. ""I had been in the Congress for over 25 years and the kind of confusion that is going in the party today was not there in the past. The kind of indiscipline that has set in it, I have not seen in the past,"" he said.

Citing an example, he said in Kerala in the recent Rajya Sabha elections, a section in Congress openly voted against the official candidate and the leadership did not take any action against the open revolt.

""How can a party which cannot control its cadres anymore, think of ruling the country anymore,"" he asked.

There was no question of his party compromising on the foreign origin issue of Sonia Gandhi, he said, adding ""India is the biggest democracy in the world and we know how to rule our country"".

Area deputy superintendent of police, Pradip Gupta, said, ""The weapon used by the poachers could not be recovered. That is why they could not be booked under the Arms Act. But, they were arrested under Section 9/50 of the Wildlife Protection Act.""

Gupta tried to cover up by saying that it was not as if a lot of deer hunting was going on in the area. He said that people killed neelgai as they caused â€˜a lot of damage to crops.'' But, he admitted that the killing of neelgai, in any area, required a permit from the district administration. ""However, the locals do not have permits,"" he added.
