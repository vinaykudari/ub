0,Johar shifts Mohali college principal,"MOHALI: ""I hope you wonâ€™t regret calling me to address the convocation,"" Punjab Vidhan Sabha deputy speaker and Kharar MLA Bir Devinder Singh had remarked at the convocation of Mohali Government College, on Sunday. Nobody took the remark seriously then. But it came true on Tuesday, as Bir Devinder, along with Punjab minister for higher education Harnam Das Johar, paid a surprise visit to the college.

This time the teachers and the principal of the college were at the receiving end as the minister was appalled to see the sorry state of affairs in the college. The man at the receiving end was T S Sohi, principal of the college.

After going round the hostel and the canteen which were in a bad shape, the minister told the DPI colleges, ""Make sure that this man is transferred by today evening.""

The minister went around the various labs and classes of the college and remarked on the poor maintenance. In the home science lab, he found that the teachers had made a makeshift kitchen for making tea.

""Is this all you do in the home science department, make tea?,"" he said, reprimanding the lecturers.

The minister also visited the zoology lab and was not happy to see costly animal specimens in the open. ""At least treat the dead men who are helping you study, with respect,"" he told the staff pointing out to a human skeleton kept in a wooden cupboard.

Later, addressing media persons, Harnam Das Johar said that the sorry state of affairs was because of lack of initiative on the part of teachers and the staff. He thanked Bir Devinder for bringing the state of affairs at the college to his notice.

""I am shocked that the 20-year-old college, spread over an area of 28 acres, does not have proper canteen and toilets.

He instructed the DPI (colleges) Nisha Sharad to constitute a three-member committee to inquire into the affairs of the college. ""Those responsible for the mess will be punished.

And the teachers too should get their act right. Let me tell them that they should not take their posting in Mohali for granted,"" he said, sounding a warning to the teachers.

The minister also visited the shooting range which is a part of the college campus.

1,State govt hikes salaries of subordinate judges,"GANDHINAGAR: The state government has issued a notification raising the salaries of the subordinate judges as per the recommendations of the Shetty Commission appointed by the central government to review the pay-scale and perks of judges.

Accordingly, subordinate judges will get a hike in their salaries ranging between Rs 2,500 to Rs 3,000 per month, and the decision will entail an additional burden of Rs 5 crore on the state exchequer.

The hike in the salaries will be given with retrospective effect from July 1996 and therefore the judges will be given arrears totalling Rs 35 crore. A major chunk of the arrears will be deposited in their provident fund, sources in the legal department said.

The recommendations of the Shetty Commission have been implemented by several states as directed by the Supreme Court. However, the state government has not taken any decision on the perks and other facilities as mentioned in the report.

As per the recommendation, the revised salary of civil judges (junior division) will be in the following scale â€” Rs 9,000-250-10750-300-13150-350-14550. (2) Civil judges (junior division first stage acp scale) Rs 10750-300-13150-350-14900. (3) Civil judges (senior division) Rs 12850-300-13150-350-15950-400-17550. (4) Civil judges (senior division, first stage acp scale) Rs 14200-350-15950-400-18350. (5) District judges (entry level, second stage acp for civil judges senior division) Rs 16750-400-19150-450-20500. (6) District judges (selection grade) Rs 18750-400-19150-450-21850-500-22850. (7) District judges (supertime scale) Rs 22850-500-24850.

Sources said the government had, while increasing court fees, stated in the official Bill passed by the assembly that it needed funds to meet the additional expenditure due to revision of pay scales of subordinate judges.

The government has already communicated to the Supreme Court about the notification issued on the hike.

The Supreme Court had, during the last hearing on the implementation of the Shetty Commission, directed chief secretary P K Laheri to see that the recommendations were accepted by the state government at the earliest.

2,BMC rectifies defect in bio-waste incinerator,"MUMBAI: For almost two months, the chimneys of the bio-medical waste incinerator in Sewri''s TB hospital have been spewing out pollutants that are almost eight times higher than the permissible limit.

The BMC found that the incinerator''s levels of particulate matter â€” the tiny particles released from the chimneys â€” stood at 792 parts per million (ppm). The Maharashtra Pollution Control Board''s standard for incinerators is 100 ppm.

The water shower that arrests the suspended particles had stopped functioning, and failed to filter the pollutants, said chief engineer R R Markandeya.

Last month, this newspaper reported on the plight of residents affected by the polluted air in the area. Local doctors had noted increasing allergic bronchitis among the residents. Children and old people were the worst affected.

The BMC warned the operator E A Infrastructure that it would suspend its contract if things didn''t improve.

After the repair of the ''scrub'', which washes the smoke, the air in the chimney was found to have only 16 ppm, Mr Markandeya said.

The BMC had installed an air-quality monitoring vehicle in the area for four days. Curiously, Mr Markandeya said that the BMC''s environment department recorded high pollutants in the area even when the incinerator was switched off. The incinerator is on generally between 3 p.m. and 11 p.m. It burns waste when material is brought in.

""We noticed that from 7 a.m. to 2 p.m., the air contains around 200 ppm of suspended particles, which could be because of vehicular pollution. From 3 p.m. to 11 p.m., when the plant is working, the figure was 250 ppm. However, during the period (from 2 a.m. to 6 a.m.) when the vehicular traffic is lower and incinerator is also shut, the air contained around 50 ppm,"" Mr Marakandeya said.

Last week municipal commissioner Karun Srivastava called a meeting of senior civic officials to discuss the environmental reports. The administration concluded that the pollution in the area was due to the combined effects of incinerator and vehicular pollution. However, Mr Srivastava has asked for a fortnightly survey of the air in the area.

Though the residents claimed that soot particles had started ""raining"" from the chimney two months ago, Mr Markandeya said that the BMC rectified the problem within 15 days of receiving the complaint.

3,HC rebukes govt for not giving power to local bodies,"PATNA: In a recent order, Patna High Court rebuked the state government for maintaining an ""anti-people stance"" by not transferring the real power to the self-governing organisations like the panchayati raj institutions and the urban local bodies (municipal).

A division bench, comprising Chief Justice R S Dhavan and Justice R N Prasad, observed that the manner in which the self-governing institutions were being treated by the state government in Bihar was ""subversive to democracy, self-governing institutions and the Constitution of India"".

The court cannot help but reiterate the guidelines provided by the 11th Finance Commission for transfer of power to the self-governing institutions, allocation of funds, disbursement, utilisation and intimation of the same to the government of India.

The court maintained that the conditions for release of funds to the local bodies in the form of grants were important to be followed.

The 11th Finance Commission envisages that in case powers, responsibilities and resources have not been devolved to the panchayati raj institutions and urban local bodies, the state should ensure that it is done by March 31, 2002.

The high court further said that in such cases the central government would withhold 25 per cent of the grants, as per the provisions.

The 11th Finance Commission has maintained that the local bodies should raise matching resources amounting to no less than 25 per cent central grant in case of panchayati raj institutions and 50 per cent in case of urban local bodies. In case they fail to provide the matching resources, the state government should provide the balance within three months, it adds.

Pointing out these provisions, the court observed that the state government had been providing half-baked information to the court.

""Someone within the portals of power in Patna, politicians or bureaucrats, wants to control the funds meant for these self-governance institutions,"" the court said, adding that this is denial of power to these institutions.

The lawyer of Bihar Rajya Panchayat Parishad, M P Gupta, said that the central fund to be given to the panchayati raj institutions and municipal bodies were meant to provide basic civic amenities to the people.

By not transferring the central fund, the state government had rather denied the people the basic civic amenities, he added.

5,Staff protest RBI move,"PATNA: The Reserve Bank Employees'' Association (RBEA) and Reserve Bank Workers'' Union (RBWU) on Tuesday staged a dharna against the move of the RBI to close note examination sections all over the country and burn old currency notes without counting and examination.

REBA secretary Shiv Thakur said that it was only after counting and examination of the notes that they were sent for destruction. For this purpose the bank had 120 manual note examination centres in the country in addition to the 44 currency processing and verification systems (CPVS), he said.

He said that the RBI had already closed several manual centres in Ahmedabad, Jaipur, Chennai, New Delhi, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Guwahati.

However, GM, rural planning and credit department, RBI, Patna, P Arvindakshan, said that they had not received any notice to close down the note examination section.

Later, members of RBEA and RBWU took out a rally.

Leaders from other trade unions such as the Bank Employees Federation also participated in it.

6,"Widespread violence, no complaints","KOLKATA: State election commissioner Ajoy Sinha on Tuesday claimed that not a single formal complaint had been received by his department about the unprecedented violence alleged by the Opposition during the panchayat polls.

â€œWhy are they complaining only to the media? They have not filed any written complaint. In fact, not even any specific verbal complaint has been made to us by the Opposition members about either the election process or counting,â€� Sinha said.

â€œOnly in Basanti, RSP members refused to be inside the counting centre despite our request,â€� he said, grouping the Left Front partner with the Opposition. â€œIf the Opposition are disturbed about poll violence, they can come and file complaints, which for some strange reason they have not done,â€� he added.

He also reacted sharply to comments made by BJP president Venkaiah Naidu that an independent agency should conduct the polls. Sinha said, â€œI do not know who he is and what is he talking about. Let him say what he wants.â€�

Meanwhile, results of gram panchayat seats will not be available till Wednesday afternoon due to inordinate delay in starting the counting process and wrong estimation by the state election commission which had earlier said that the complete results will be out by Tuesday.

â€œIn some of the centres, counting started late and there was a shortage of manpower,â€� Sinha explained.

By 7 pm, only zilla parishad results were declared and counting for panchayat samity seats had just started.

â€œTo make available all the results in the pram panchayats, another day will be needed,â€� he said.

There was also a mismatch between ballot papers and ballot accounts which delayed the beginning of counting at many places, Sinha claimed.

7,Four arrested in baby swap case,"HYDERABAD: The exchange of Lathaâ€™s and Mehmooda Begumâ€™s babies in the cradle at the nursery of the Government Maternity Hospital, Nayapul, could have taken place on April 17 and could have gone unnoticed on purpose or by accident.

â€œWe are not ruling out anything and the case is still open,â€™â€™ police officials investigating the case told The Times of India on Tuesday.

Additional commissioner of police A K Khan said they made four arrests on Tuesday including two nurses, Suryakala, Suvarna Mary, sweeper Rajender also known as Raju and Mehmooda Begumâ€™s husband Sheikh Nazeer.

They have been charged under sections 336, 167, 201, 419 of the Indian Penal Code for cheating, alteration of documents and injury, Khan said. â€œSection 336 has been applied for rash and negligent behaviour which involves and affects the life of a female infant.â€™â€™

According to the conclusion arrived at by the police that the babies were exchanged in their cradle on April 17, the change could not have possibly gone unnoticed as the babies have a tag referring them to the mother they belong to. â€œSo unless the tag has been removed on purpose, exchanged on purpose or they fall off by callousness and sheer negligence, the babies could not have been exchanged or swapped,â€™â€™ sources said.

And this, they said, could be found out only if the nurses speak up. It is not just the nurses who are keeping an annoying silence, it is Mehmooda Begum and her husband too.

The police is looking into why Latha did not get to see her baby much when he was placed in the nursery. â€œOr was she not allowed to. We do not know what exactly happened in those four days. We can only guess, unless the nurses tell us what happened,â€™â€™ they said.

Though the police have not found any exchange of money they are not taking chances and not ruling out anything. â€œA detailed probe on the possibility of involvement of other people and suspected underhand dealings in the exchange of babies at the hospital is also on,â€™â€™ Khan said. The police say they are willing to keep the identity of those who give information confidential.

Meanwhile, the arrested were produced in a local court and were remanded to two weeks of judicial custody.

8,BJP to downplay Hindutva in state polls,"NEW DELHI: BJP president M Venkaiah Naidu has told party colleagues, particularly in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, not to get distracted by the Congress'' attempts to shift the electoral debate from development to Hindutva.

""I have told our people to return to the development agenda and stress that the Congress governments in these states have failed miserably,"" he told Times News Network.

Referring to the presentation made on development indicators in MP recently by party general secretaries Pramod Mahajan and Arun Jaitley, Naidu said, ""On May 25, Arun will hold another press conference in MP, this time based on what the UNDP report has to say on MP.""

Clearly, it is not to the BJP''s advantage to play the Hindutva card in the forthcoming Assembly elections in the Congress-ruled states of MP, Rajasthan, Chattisgarh, Delhi and Mizoram, as it had done in Gujarat.

It, therefore, sees the Congress'' bringing to centrestage the VHP''s trishul deeksha ceremony in Rajasthan or the issue of cow slaughter in MP or indeed, Uma Bharati''s indiscretions - whether it be the notorious cake kand or her recent journey to Kedarnath with lapsed BJP leader Govindacharya - as attempts to divert public attention from the bread and butter issue of development.

""The Congress wants to hide its failures,"" Naidu said, adding, ""if Togadia wants to make a speech, the heavens won''t fall. The Congress is strident about the trident, but is silent on the use of the AK-47.""

Based on the BJP''s own ""internal assessment"", its ""major electoral theme"" in the in the Assembly elections, Naidu said, would be shortcomings in governance: The BJP will issue separate manifestos for the five states - barring Mizoram, the party will contest on its own.

In MP, the focus, he said, would be the shortage of power and the poor progress in rural roads; in Rajasthan, the malfunctioning of the PDS; in Chattisgarh, the lack of administration; and in Delhi, corruption in the power sector.

Party units have beem asked to prepare dossiers on the Congress: ""We want to face the Congress with facts and figures, not general allegations. And our campaign will not be against individuals, but against governments.""

With most of its chief ministerial candidates unlikely to win personality contests against Congress'' incumbents, the party wants to stick to an issue-based campaign.

In Mizoram, the party wants to attempt its Nagaland experiment, an experiment which saw the BJP through judicious electoral alliances with local parties, joining the ruling coalition there: The BJP state unit is working on roping in some non-Congress parties, including the Mizo National Front, into an electoral alliance.

On June 6, Naidu, his general secretaries, officebearers and ""guardian"" ministers of all the seven northeastern states, and Union minister Dr C P Thakur, who is in charge of the north east, will meet in Guwahati.

""We feel we have potential to grow in the north east, and this will be a beginning,"" Naidu said.

9,Baby swap: Mehmooda Begum likely to be arrested,"HYDERABAD: The city police is likely to arrest Mehmooda Begum, whose girl child was swapped with that of Lathaâ€™s boy at the Government Maternity Hospital, Nayapul.

Mehmoodaâ€™s husband, Sheikh Nazeer, was arrested on Tuesday along with two nurses â€” Suryakala, Suvarna Mary and sweeper Rajender alias Raju.

They have been charged under sections 336, 167, 201, 419 of the Indian Penal Code for cheating, alteration of documents and injury, additional commissioner of police A K Khan said. â€œSection 336 has been applied for rash and negligent behaviour which involves and affects the life of a female infant,â€� Khan said.

â€œAs of now we are going soft on her (Mehmooda Begum) as she is suckling her baby and her health is also not too good,â€� an officer investigating the baby-swap case said.

Mehmooda is likely to be arrested because she had taken the boy home despite knowing that it wasnâ€™t her child. â€œIf her intentions were right, she too could have booked a case and said the hospital was forcing her to take a male child. But she did not do that,â€� the officer said. She only made a feeble confession on Monday. It could be because she wanted to pass the blame on to the hospital staff, police said.

10,"Dalit politics: Noises in the air, ground unclean","BHOPAL: Every day at 4 o''clock in the morning, Asha, 28, and her husband Rajkumar, 30, walk four km on foot from Itwara to reach their ''dera'' or workplace. Their destination: Chandwara, the old city of the Nawabs, where dry latrines need to be cleaned.

Asha knocks on the tin sheet that guards the rear of the latrine. On getting no response, she lifts the tin sheet and collects the day-old human excreta in a bamboo basket. The waste is dumped in a drain 2 km away.

To clean 40 houses here, she makes around six trips to the drain with the basket on her head.

""It''s a flat rate of Rs 10 per month per adult,"" said Rajkumar. ""If a family of six adults and two children use the dry toilet, we get Rs 60 per month for the adults. For the children, the rate is - one roti per child per day. But the rotis are mostly leftovers and stale.""

About 5,000 Dalit families in Bhopal eke out a living cleaning dry toilets. This in a state which has become the hub of Dalit sloganeering in the past year-and-a-half.

Incidentally, in a situation where both the BJP and the chief minister are eyeing the Dalit votebank, CM Digvijay Singh was not permitted to go to Vancouver for a Dalit conference. The BJP is setting the stage to come out with its Dalit agenda.

Although both parties are fighting for the significant 36 per cent of the Dalit votebank, neither has taken note of the fact that these ''valmikis'' or ''mehtars'' continue their dehumanising work hardly five km from the chief minister''s official residence.

The National Human Development Report 2001 says 7.87 per cent households in MP have access to flush toilets as against 90.14 per cent in Karnataka, 58.14 per cent in Bihar and 9.46 per cent in Orissa.

""Why just private cleaners, there are 200 Dalits working with the city municipal corporation for the same purpose,"" said Vijay Shravan, president M P Sakal Valmiki Panchayat, a Dalit NGO.

""The corporation doesn''t give these employees gloves or masks. While others clean dry toilets, the muck is dumped in trolleys manned by the corporation''s Dalit employees.""

""The chief minister says he has distributed land to 3.5 lakh Dalits. My NGO approached the state several times so the contracts to clean medical and human waste may be given to a Dalit organisation. But the government has continued to give it to a Brahmin.""

11,CPM accuses govt of toeing VHP line on Ayodhya,"NEW DELHI: The CPM has accused the Vajpayee government of toeing the VHP line on Ayodhya by submitting before the Liberhan Commission that Babri Masjid was constructed at the site of an earlier temple at Lord Ram''s birth place.

The party in a statement on Tuesday took exception to the government''s offering this viewpoint as ''undisputed fact''. It pointed out that the government stand was a clear echo of the VHP position that the mosque had been built by demolishing a Ram temple.

It further said that while so far the birth of Ram at that place had been a ""matter of faith"" it now became an ""undisputed fact"" for the government.

""This partisan stand has been taken while the judicial process is on and the dispute has not been settled,"" the party said. The government stand, the party said, will help the VHP and go to the disadvantage of the legal process.

12,Bill to amend contempt law stacked in favour of courts,"NEW DELHI: Last week, Law Minister Arun Jaitley announced that the proposed amendment in the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971 - by introducing truth as a defence - would make ""the judiciary more accountable"". However, the draft Bill, which ignores certain key suggestions made by the Constitution Review Commission, still vests considerable power in the courts.

The Bill provides that truth can be a defence in contempt actions only if it is in the public interest. But it sidesteps the CRC''s recommendation that Article 19 (2) of the Constitution - dealing with restriction to the right to expression - be amended by adding a proviso: ""In matters of contempt, it shall be open to the Court on satisfaction of the bona fides of the pleas and of requirements of public interest to permit a defence of justification of truth.""

The draft bill is also silent on the CRC''s recommendation that the power of a court to punish for contempt of itself be limited to the Supreme Court and high courts alone, and, as a privilege, to Parliament and state legislatures.

""No other court, tribunal or authority should have, or be conferred with, a power to punish for contempt of itself,"" the CRC had said.

But law ministry officials said that the government was following the CRC''s recommendation seriously. ""The CRC has said that truth can be a defence if the matter is in public interest. We are going by it.""

However, he admitted that since the power of defining ""public interest"" would be vested in the courts, truth as defence might not be so effective. But he is clear that amending Article 19 (2) would not take place.

""We are not contemplating amending the Constitution at this stage. Let''s see how the amendment in the contempt law works,"" he explains.

The official admitted that amending the contempt law itself had not been easy. According to him, two drafts of the proposed amendment were placed before Jaitley on April 23. ""The minister agreed to the first draft though the second one was more far-reaching,"" he said.

The second draft, while proposing truth as defence if it is in the public interest, also specifically mentioned: ""No court shall impose a sentence under this Act for a contempt of court unless it is satisfied that the contempt is of such a nature that it substantially interferes with, or tends substantially to interfere with, the due course of justice.""

13,Mufti government is short lived: NC,"JAMMU: Alleging that the PDP-led coalition government in Jammu and Kashmir came to power on false propaganda of ""healing touch,"" National Conference provincial president on Wednesday said the Mufti Mohammed Sayeed government is short lived and will collapse soon.

""Mufti government came into power on false and mischievous propaganda, which is eroding day by day,"" Ajay Sadhotra, a senior NC leader and former minister told a delegates conference here.

As a result, Mufti government is short lived and will fall soon, he claimed

Questioning the healing touch policy of the PDP government, Sadhotra said providing jobs to militancy victims is not healing touch and claimed that the National Conference government of Farooq Abdullah provided ""thousands of jobs"" to the militancy victims but never tried to gain political mileage out of it.

The NC leader asserted that his party has prepared a ""historical"" document and a resolution was passed in the Assembly to grant autonomy, which was given to the state as per Delhi agreement of 1952.

""It has been put open for public debate and we believe that this is the only formula, which can solve the vexed problem of the state"" Sadhotra said.

If the present government headed by Mufti Mohammed Sayeed has any other formula better than this he should come forward with that, he added.

14,"Punjab govt to crack the whip on doctors, donors","CHANDIGARH: After the clandestine trade in kidney sale being exposed by the police, the Punjab government has decided to crack the whip on doctors and middlemen to avoid its recurrence.

Sources said the government had formulated a new set of directives for doctors to follow under which the police would have an increased role to play in containing the sale of the organ.

The government proposes to issue a notification under which a DSP rank police officer would be authorised to file complaints regarding irregularities in sale of kidney.

The decisions taken at a highlevel meeting presided over by the state chief secretary, are likely to come into effect within a month or so. While kidney surgeons would be required to conduct transplants with more caution and circumspection, the government proposes to reconstitute the authorisation committees with representatives of the deputy commissioner, police and social organisations being inducted to it in addition to the panel of five doctors that existed earlier.

With the authorisation committees becoming broad-based, the government proposes to take away doctors monopoly on deciding the fitness of cases worthy of transplantation.

Under the Transplantation of Human Organs Act, no transplant could be carried out till it was cleared by an authorisation committee headed by principal of the local government medical college.

The director, medical education and research, would be required to conduct inspections twice a year at all hospitals where kidney transplants are done and in case any hospital is detected to be indulging in malpractices, the DRME would be immediately barring the hospital from carrying on with the business.

In order to contain the menace of poor and gullible labourers falling victim to the designs of middlemen and selling their kidneys in dubious circumstances, the government would make it binding on the authorisation committee to get the credentials of any donor verified by the police before okaying his case for kidney donation.

Besides, at least two relatives of any donor would be required to submit an undertaking to explain the reason and relation of the donor and the recipients. So far, the authorisation committees had been relying on information submitted by donors without any verifications being done thereafter.

Donors would be required to submit their domicile certificates as well to support the evidence of the place they come from.

Principal secretary, medical education and research, Rajesh Chhabra, said a blueprint of new directions had been pending approval of the minister and was expected to come into effect within a month.

15,Hawala operator arrested in city,"NEW DELHI: Five days after the special cell arrested a journalist of Kashmir Press Agency for allegedly acting as a conduit for terrorists organisations, the department arrested a hawala operator in Delhi on Tuesday evening.

Zafar Umar was arrested from near Veer Bhoomi. The police recovered Rs four lakh from Umar''s possession. A pistol loaded with nine cartridges was also recovered from him.

The police claimed Umar acted on behalf of a Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) based terrorist organisation. ""We are yet to identify the organisation,"" an officer said, adding the police are aware of Umar''s associate in J&K.

Umar had apparently received cash from a person when he was apprehended. The police, however, failed to arrest the man who delivered the cash. ""The man had left before we reached the spot,"" the officer said.

During interrogation Umar said he had to contact a person named Omar in Kashmir and hand over the cash to him. Omar is a terrorist, the police claimed.

A team of special cell officers will leave for J&K since they have received Umar is in police custody for five days. Umar has been to Delhi thrice in the past. ""All the visits pertained to hawala operations,"" the police said.

Umar received Rs 25,000 for every transaction, the police said.
