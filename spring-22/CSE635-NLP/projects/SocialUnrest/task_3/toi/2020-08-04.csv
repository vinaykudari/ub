0,State govt to request CBI to investigate smuggling of woods,"HYDERABAD: Alarmed by the increasing incidents of smuggling of the rare Red sanders wood from the forests of Cuddapah, Kurnool, Ananthapur and Chitoor districts, the state government is set to request the Central Bureau of Investigation to probe the smuggling of the rare wood to other countries.

Efforts by the forest department to have the CBI probe the smuggling of Red Sanders, a hard wood so far popular in Japan for making ''Shamosin'', a stringed musical instrument, began some months ago but it was only recently that the state government agreed to request to ask the CBI to probe the smuggling.

The urgency for a comprehensive probe, involving various state governments including those of Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, New Delhi, Sikkim and some other states which have emerged as the route for the smugglers, arose after the November 2002 seizure of 26 tonnes of Red Sanders in Chennai.

""The demand for Red Sanders is now also coming from China and new smuggling routes have been opened up through the northern states. So far, Chennai was a major transit city for Red Sanders smugglers selling the wood to Japanese buyers,"" a source in the forest department said.

Such has been the spurt in demand for Red Sanders that the state forest department officials seized 37 vehicles smuggling the wood since April this year.

Earlier, each kilogram of the wood used to be purchased from wood cutters for about Rs 40. Now with the drought, there are more and more people willing to take a chance to make money by joining hands with the smugglers, a forest department official said. By the time the wood reaches its destination, its price multiplies manifold, the offical added.

Most of the smuggled Red Sanders is passed off as ''patta'' Red Sanders, the trees which are grown in patta land by some persons in Tamil Nadu who have permission to do so.

However, ironically, the Japanese association of musical instrument makers has written a letter to the exporters of Red Sanders that they prefer wood from the naturally grown trees than those reared by the ''patta'' Red Sanders.

Red Sanders is included in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade on Endangered Species (CITES) of Flora and Fauna. It also finds a place in the ''Negative listed'' species of the EXIM policy.

1,"IP University, AICTE clash as students of architecture suffer","NEW DELHI: All those who appeared for the architecture entrance examination of Guru Gobind Singh Indraprashta University (GGSIU) be prepared for the worst. The All India Council of Technical Education (AICTE) has banned two of the three architecture institutes affiliated to GGSIU from admitting students this session.

The ban has come despite the university already having held an entrance examination. Admissions in the third institute are stalled because it is fighting a case against the Haryana government. The three institutes - Sushant School of Art and Architecture (Gurgaon), the Vastu Kala Academy (near JNU) and the TVB School of Habitat Studies (Vasant Kunj), are facing different problems. This has left hundreds of students, competing for 120 seats, in the lurch.

Consequently, the Indraprastha University has been forced to postpone the counselling session which was scheduled for Monday. It will be held on August 19. â€˜â€˜The AICTE has put two institutes under the no-admission category. We were informed after we had conducted the entrance. But we cannot go ahead with admissions until AICTE gives the clearance,â€™â€™ university spokesperson Shevanti Sanyal said. This has upset students who took the examination.

â€˜â€˜Whatever dispute there was, should have been solved before the entrance examination. The university has already postponed the counselling thrice,â€™â€™ said a disgruntled student who scored a good merit. The institutes on their part maintain that the council should not stall admissions once the entrance examination has already been held. The council, however, said the objections were being raised for the past many years. â€˜â€˜Our job is to maintain the quality of education. We gave the institutes enough time to look into the requirements,â€™â€™ Council of Architects president P R Mehta said.

2,Admissions to law faculty suspended,"NEW DELHI: Admissions of students whose names had appeared in the waiting list of Delhi Universityâ€™s Law Faculty, were suspended after students from different unions created a furore alleging foul play.

Authorities summoned the police and have lodged a complaint alleging â€˜â€˜pressure tacticsâ€™â€™ by student union members to get some students admitted. No case has been registered. The point of contention was the â€˜â€˜drastic dipâ€™â€™ in the waiting list whereas the dip after the first cut-off list was not much.

Admissions to the first cut-off list happened between July 10 to 19, while admissions to the second cut-off list were done between July 21 to 29. Admissions to the waiting list were announced on Monday. Admission convener V K Dixit claimed some students already studying there had approached him asking for admission of some students who had qualified in the first cut-off list but failed to take admission within the given time.

Dixit said the sharp dip was caused due to the defence forces (around 75 seats) and physically challenged quota (around 45 seats).

4,Violence erputs after political groups clash,"BANGALORE: Violence broke out in Kanakapura town when two political groups holding separate protests clashed on Monday.

The mobs went berserk burning vehicles, pelting stones at policemen and damaging vehicles. Police resorted to lathicharge to quell the unruly mob.

At about 11 am, members of Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) were protesting in front of the Social Welfare Department office in Kanakapura town demanding the suspension of one Puttamaregowda, child development programme officer accused of mismanagement at a students'' hostel.

Barely a kilometre away, members of Janapara Sangatane were holding a programme in front of the Tahsildhar''s office against the BSP''s demands.

Some BSP members barged into the Sangatane''s programme and a minor scuffle broke out after which the police managed to chase the troublemakers away.

However, an hour later, a large number BSP activists armed with wooden batons attacked the Sangatane''s gathering.

Policemen at the function were injured when the clashing mobs pelted stones at them. Some motorcycles too were burnt.

The situation was brought under control after police reinforcements were rushed from neighbouring areas.

Police have taken up cases of rioting and attacking policemen, and arrested several persons.

6,'Steep increase in white-collar crimes',"HYDERABAD: There is a steep increase in white-collar crimes and the official machinery has failed to minimise the crime rate as officials do not know how fake documents used to commit this type of fraud can be identified, said R K Jain, the government examiner for questioned documents (GEQD).

Speaking on Monday at the inaugural session of a training programme for the officers of the department of company affairs, Jain said people depend on documents whether it is for financial, legal, business or social matter.

The multifarious use of documents and their importance is inviting criminals to commit fraud through falsification of documents, he said.

Though white-collar crimes make only 5 per cent of the total crime, the financial loss caused by this category of crime is 95 per cent.

For instance, fake stamps and counterfeit currency have resulted in losses worth several thousand crores, he said.

Added to the manual document falsification, computer crimes are also on the rise.

Despite this alarming situation, various government departments dealing with documents, particularly banks, and even private organisations are not bothered to devise security measures to prevent white collar crimes, Jain said.

With an intention to create awareness among the officers of various departments, the office of GEQD, Hyderabad, has been organising training courses regarding forensic documents and computer forensics, he said.

7,United Cong may spoil TDP poll party,"HYDERABAD: For many senior Congress leaders, Chandrababu Naidu is not a big challenge for the party. At all previous hustings when the Congress lost, the party leaders blamed internal squabbles, dissidence and groupism for the debacle.

And there is an element of truth in such reasons. In the 1999 Assembly elections, the Congress won 90 seats, while the party lost in another 30 segments with less than 5,000 votes. Congress insiders admit that selection of wrong candidates cost the party another 30 to 40 seats. A simple calculation of the above statistics shows that the party could have secured a minimum of 150-160 seats, enough to form a government in the state.

""It is the ability of Congress''s readiness to choose the winning horses and put the dissidence at bay which matters in the elections, and certainly not the manoveuverings skills of Chandrababu Naidu,"" summed up a veteran Congress leader, when asked whether the party was ready to take on the TDP in the next elections.

An MLA from Rayalaseema had another interesting point to offer on the party''s readiness: ""The Congress is a leaderbased party. If a person is denied ticket, he will ensure defeat of the official candidate. Whereas the TDP has loyal cadre and has only one supreme leader. Even if a leader is refused party nomination, he can do little to damage the prospects of an official nominee as leaders other than Chandrababu Naidu hardly matter in that party.""

Though the Congress has many splinter groups, the party camps now seem to be split between pro and anti Y S Rajasekhara Reddy groups.

Banking on mere anti-establishment mood alone might not help the Congress to secure power.

A united Congress, free of dissidence, complete loyalty to the party leadership, devoid of internal squabbles, can only take on the TDP in the elections. Given the present circumstances, the party has still several miles to go in achieving the objective.

8,CPI-ML demands Siwan MP’s arrest,"PATNA: State unit of the CPI-ML has demanded immediate arrest of RJD MP Mohd Shahabuddin and trial of his cases outside Siwan.

The party has also demanded early completion of the CBI investigations into the killing of JNU studentsâ€™ union former president Chandrasekhar and withdrawal of Tada cases against Shahchand and all other CPI-ML activists of Jehanabad district. The party has decided to organise a â€œMaha dharnaâ€� on August 8 and 9.

This will be preceded by a protest day to be observed throughout the state on August 6. The party further said despite being a known fact that Mohd Shahabuddin is a notorious criminal, yet RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav searching for plea not to pursue his arrest.

â€œIrony is that while a man like Shahabuddin kept on giving challenges to the government machinery over his arrest, party activist like Shahchand is implicated in Tada cases on concocted charges,â€� the party said.

9,No salary for Patan nagarpalika workers since January,"AHMEDABAD: Ironical it may sound but while the government machinery gears up to celebrate the Independence Day in Patan, over 200 workers of the Patan nagarpalika have nothing to cheer about. It''s been six months now that the workers last got their salaries.

""It''s really unfortunate and even ironical. On one hand there will be celebrations, while on the other, there are so many families who haven''t got their salaries after January 2003. How are they supposed to survive,"" says Bansilal Shah of the Patan Nagarpalika Karmachari Sangh.

While the workers'' association have made numerous representations but to no avail. ""All our requests have fallen on deaf ears. Every time we approach the authorities, the standard answer we get is that there is no money with the civic body. Over 200 families have been left in the lurch because of the apathetic attitude of the authorities. We have nothing against the celebrations, but it''s inhuman not to pay these workers for their rights,"" he says.

But then the authorities plead helplessness. ""The civic body is facing severe financial crisis,"" says the nagarpalika president, Mansukh Patel. According to him, the civic body has to pay Rs 27 lakh to the workers every month as salary.

""We have not been able to pay the sum for the past six months. And one of the reasons behind it was the implementation of the new pay-scale last year. There was an additional burden of Rs 10 lakh every month because of the new pay-scale,"" he adds.

The association, however, has requested the civic body to break up the sum and pay the outstanding amount at the earliest. ""Besides having written to the concerned officials, we have also written to Chief Minister Narendra Modi and education minister and Patan MLA Anandiben Patel about our problem. But nothing has been done so far,"" says a Karmachari Sangh source.

However, the civic body president believes that the problem would be solved soon. Patel says, ""We are in the process of raising taxes to increase the revenue. We are trying our level best.""

10,Congmen told to spread party policy,"PATNA: The BPCC president, Ram Jatan Sinha, has directed all Congressmen to visit villages with ''Kranti Jyoti'' between August 9 to 15 and propogate programmes and policies of the party.

Addressing district-level party officials at Sadaquat Ashram on Monday, he asked them to abide by the directives of the AICC. He told them there was a need to regain confidence of the masses so that the party could get back its position that it commanded in the past in the state''s affairs.

Sinha said that the programme in hand was more improtant because an agitation spearheaded by the AICC chief Sonia Gandhi, against the communal forces was going on in the country. Speaking on the contemporary political scenario facing the country, he said that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was trying to incite the religious sentiments of the people, while educated unemployed youths, labourers, farmers and the poor people were feeling helpless and unable to do anything.

He also accused the NDA government of ""surrendering"" before the US. ""The country is not safe in the hands of NDA government,"" Sinha said, adding it was the duty of every Congressman to fan out in the rural areas and apprise rural people of the present situation facing the country.

11,"Badal, 42 party MLAs to court arrest","CHANDIGARH: Undeterred by the Amarinder Singh governmentâ€™s offensive against him, former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal seems determined to consolidate and strengthen his support base.

Contrary to expectations, when his party should be losing popularity in the wake of corruption charges against Badal and his former cabinet colleagues, the SAD president would be launching second phase of the party membership drive hoping to rope in new members.

In an effort to build a counter pressure on the Amarinder Singh government, Badal announced here on Monday that he, along with his 42 MLAs, would offer to court arrest here on September 5 to protest against the Congress governmentâ€™s policies.

Badal, after holding deliberations at the SADâ€™s political affairs committee meeting and another round of talks with all his party MLAs at the Kalgidhar Niwas, said the proposed â€˜â€˜rosh sabhaâ€™â€™ (protest rally) would highlight the alleged murder of democracy that took place during the present Congress rule as also the repression unleashed on the SAD leaders.

In order to boost the sagging morale of the party workers, Badal has, in addition, called the Central leaders like Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani, defence minister George Fernandes, human resources minister Murli Manohar Joshi and law minister Arun Jaitley, to address the Shiromani Akali Dal public meetings in days to come.

Fernandes is scheduled to participate in the SADâ€™s â€˜â€˜rakad punyaâ€™â€™ rally at Baba Bakala in Amritsar district on August 12 and Advani, along with others, would be attending the SAD meeting in Longowal village in Sangrur district on August 20. He said the state was witnessing an â€˜â€˜absoluteâ€™â€™ break-down of law and order situation.

The Amarinder government, he said, had bartered away the interests of Punjab as had been evident the way disinvestment in the profitmaking Punjab Tractors Ltd was carried out and the work on the Bathinda oil refinery obstructed by the state government.

He also condemned the state governmentâ€™s move to introduce privatisation in the Punjab State Electricity Board, which, he said, had failed as an experiment in many other states.

In order to strengthen the partyâ€™s organisational structure, Badal announced to recast the state executive and PAC, inducting members from the Tohra faction.

12,Govt in sync with Advani on joint polls,"NEW DELHI: The Union government is exploring the possibility of holding the five Assembly elections, scheduled for later this year, along with an early Lok Sabha poll. Highly placed government sources said on Monday that the dates being considered were either November this year, when the Assembly elections are due, or February 2004.

The first, these sources added, is possible, as it is constitutionally permissible for the government to advance the Lok Sabha polls scheduled for late 2004, if the BJP''s allies agree to it. As for the second, the government knows it would pose ""legal, constitutional and political"" problems, requiring the acquiescence of the state governments, four of which are ruled by the Congress. The law ministry, therefore, the sources added, has been asked to examine whether there is a constitutional way out.

Election Commission sources said there were two ways in which Assembly elections could be postponed beyond their five-year term: One, through a constitutional amendment, requiring a two-thirds majority in both Houses of Parliament. And, two, the government could take a cue from the Supreme Court judgment on the recent Gujarat elections, and ""persuade"" or ""create conditions"" for the dissolution of these state Assemblies just before their term ends, put the state under President''s rule, and then hold elections within six months. Both, clearly would require a perfect understanding between the BJP and the Congress.

This comes in the wake of Deputy PM L K Advani suggesting on Saturday that clubbing Lok Sabha and Assembly elections would not just save money but also help governments both at the Centre and the states to carry on with the decision-making process rather than being perpetually in election mode.

However, the government is aware it will not be possible to synchronise the Lok Sabha and all the Assembly elections at one go. A top government source said: ""If we can get all political parties to accept the principle, then over the next few Lok Sabha elections, we would be able to achieve perfect synchronicity. Each time, assembly elections due within six months could be clubbed with the Lok Sabha poll.""

What would happen to a legislature that collapsed? ""The legislatures would have fixed tenures and so if the government collapsed, another would have to be sworn in, or an election held only for the remainder of the tenure. This would also require a constitutional amendment,"" the source said. BJP sources said the reasons for the current move goes beyond the desire to save money/facilitate the decision-making process.

Since the BJP''s own assessment of its prospects in the Congress-ruled states of Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Delhi are not as rosy as it had hoped, it feels by holding both the assembly and LS polls together, the benefits that it feels would accrue to the BJP in a Vajpayee versus Sonia Gandhi contest might help it in the assembly elections as well.

13,Advani for wider debate on clubbing polls,"NEW DELHI: With his suggestion triggering off a debate among political parties, Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani on Tuesday said a final decision on the issue of synchronising Lok Sabha and Assembly elections would be taken only after wider consultations within the BJP, Government, NDA and different political parties. Chairing the meeting of the BJP Parliamentary Party in the absence of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Advani said the suggestion, initially made by Vice-President Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, would be discussed extensively within the party, the Government, NDA allies and Opposition parties before any decision is taken, party spokesman V K Malhotra told reporters here. Advani had on Saturday raised the issue saying such a proposal if implemented would not only reduce poll expenditure but would also help Governments to take crucial policy decisions without bothering about poll prospects. Besides holding informal talks with a major NDA ally, the party has also informally sounded off members of the Election Commission on the issue, he had said. Advani said despite multiplicity of parties, ""if BJP and Congress agree on major approaches it will be easy to implement"". The suggestion has met with mixed response with election experts expressing scepticism over the proposal.

15,Gas price decontrol only under new policy: Naik,"NEW DELHI: The government will take up the issue of decontrol of gas prices at the time of framing a long-term gas pricing policy, oil minister Ram Naik said on Tuesday. He said under the New Exploration Licensing Policy (NLEP) contracts, producers were at present free to sell gas at market price in accordance with contractual terms. Under Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs) finalised earlier with a number of companies, they are free to sell gas while government has right to buy it directly or through a nominee at a price mentioned in the respective PSCs, he said. Naik said the impact of gas pricing on power and fertiliser sectors would be clear once the long-term policy was decided. He told the Rajya Sabha that a Group of Ministers (GoM) headed by Deputy Chairman of Planning Commission K C Pant has considered the question of gas pricing. The government will take a view on the recommendations made by the GoM and decide the matter, he added.

They consider propagating Gujarat's investment climate as a ""continuous process"" that is renewed every year, with things improving progressively. Talking with TNN, one of them, industries minister Anil Patel, who is leading a team going to the US and Canada, said, ""We do not intend to go and tell the businessmen abroad about disturbances. If there is any impression regarding this, it is totally wrong. In fact, everyone knows that Gujarat is the best destination for investment among all Indian states."" State industries secretary D. Rajagopalan accompanies Patel. Patel, who departs from Gandhinagar on August 10 and returns on August 20 and plans to meet NGIs and American businessmen, said, ""Gujarat is the most progressive state. It has a cosmopolitan nature. It is known to have assimilated other communities in its culture. Its businesslike atmosphere is well known everywhere. We will be going abroad for the first major event of its kind to attract businessmen. We expect a very good response."" Other ministers likely to go abroad are water resources minister Narottam Patel and law minister Ashok Bhatt. Known for his closeness for Union rural development minister Kashiram Rana, Narottam Patel is likely to propagate for getting foreign investment in the textile and diamond sectors, two main activities in his home town, Surat, which he represents.

20,Group protests against UCIL,"HYDERABAD: The proposed Uranium project in Nalgonda will convert the state into ""Smasana Andhra Pradesh"" instead of Swarna Andhra Pradesh according to the Movement Against Uranium Project, a confederation of people from various walks of life. Talking to reporters here on Tuesday, Capt. J.Ramarao, convener MAUP said the mining site was located right above Nagarjuna sagar, extreme south and east and predominantly occupies reservoir limits. This would mean that the radon gas emission would blow towards Hyderabad, Khammam and Vijayawada endangering the lives of the people. The gas once emanated would take about three hours to reach Hyderabad. Exposure to the gas would affect the chromosome pattern and would lead to birth of malformed babies. Another danger that looms large from this project according to MAUP was contamination of surface water and underground water. The emissions will pollute the Akkampally reservoir as Mallapuram where the uranium-processing zone falls is within 4 km range of the reservoir. This reservoir is expected to supply drinking water to twin cities and 600 fluoride affected villages enroute. The project will also affect the flora and fauna including endangered species such as tigers, crocodiles and rare bird species that inhabit the down stream area of Krishna basin. Challenging the claims of the UCIL that it would take all necessary precautions and the radiation would be within the safe limits, Rama Rao said UCIL proposes to dump the main effluents generated by the plant (230 cubic meters per day) in a slurry close to Mallapuram village in tailing pond which itself could be a major public health hazard. The rain water that would flow into Nagarjuna Sagar would get polluted with four lakh tones of waste material a year and would affect crops, cattle and quality of milk which would convert the state into ""Smasana Andhra Pradesh"", he added. Dr Satyalakshmi, another convener, MAUP said if mining starts at this project, the emissions from the plant would lead to ovarian testicular cancer, death of children, tumour of brain and skin cancer which is so far a rare disease in the country. The MAUP would make an audio-video presentation before the Pollution control board on August 19 opposing the project.

23,Rai trains guns at party leadership,"LUCKNOW: A day after his expulsion, former BJP MLC Ramashish Rai charged the party leadership of surrendering before Mayawati and turning a blind eye to happenings in Uttar Pradesh. ""The Central leadership has become 'Dhritharashtra' while the state unit has totally surrendered before Mayawati. This would lead to certain downfall of the BJP in Uttar Pradesh,"" stated Rai, claiming that about two dozen legislators and one dozen party ministers were in regular touch with Kalyan Singh to pull down the Mayawati government. Refusing to disclose the strategy of the BJP rebels, Rai claimed that they were in regular touch with each other and would act and execute their plans during the budget session of the state legislature. Rai said that he had served the party in different capacities for the past 25 years and his only fault was that he had raised a voice against those who were bartering the party's interests to the BSP. ""Such action against dedicated party workers would prove suicidal for the party during the Lok Sabha elections,"" he warned. Accusing BJPLP Leader Lalji Tandon and state BJP chief Vinay Katiyar of digging the party's grave, the rebel MLC alleged that he paid the price for bringing the truth to the knowledge of the party's central leadership. ""I had written two letters to the party national president Venkaiah Naidu to apprise him of what was on in the party state unit but instead of looking into my complaints I was shown the door,"" he said. Reacting to Rai's charges, the BJPLP Leader Lalji Tandon said that ""he was trash in the party and by throwing him out the party did the right thing."" Issuing a stern warning to those indulging in anti-party activities, Tandon warned that similar action would be initiated against those who raised their heads.

24,Modi urges Kalam to compile data on riots,"AHMEDABAD: In perhaps the first attempt by any chief minister to involve the President of India in the bitter controversy, Chief Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday wrote a letter to President A P J Abdul Kalam seeking his directions for compilation of state-wise data on communal violence in the country and acquital of accused in these cases by the courts. Modi's letter comes in the wake of the recent Best Bakery acquittal of all the 21 accused in one of the worst communal carnages recorded in Gujarat last year. He urged the President to get compiled data on the number of terrorist attacks and communal violence, the chargesheets filed in these cases, the withdrawal of cases even after filing charge-sheets and the acquital rate of such cases after trial by the courts. Claimikng that he was writing the letter to the president ""because the nation has total faith in you"", Modi said, ""if the above data is compiled state-wise and year-wise and placed in the public domain, people themselves will be able to judge who is right. Facts on record will unveil the truth, thereby exposing the vested interests that have targetted not only Gujarat but have tried to weaken the democratic fabric and reputed institutions of the country."" In a direct reference to the NHRC's move in the Supreme Court for the reopening of the Best Bakery case and the transfer of four other carnage cases to courts outside Gujarat , Modi told the President: ""It is more disturbing that soime national level institutions are also carried away by propaganda. This needs serious attention because Gujarat bbeing a border state has a strategic importance for the nation's security"". The chief minister said Gujarat was no exception to group clashes which take place all over the country. However, he said when group clashes take place in Gujarat, there is very sharp focus on these incidents even though group clashes have attained ""alarming proportions"" in other states. He alleged that ""some external forces and non governmental organisations have been trying to raise issues with the pretext of expressing their concern about some stray incidents in Gujarat at international forums thereby tarnishing the image of the country and questioning its democratic strength"". The chief minister, while addressing the president, said: ""You will agree with me that the citizens of the country should stand up and uphold the truth"". Modi regretted that even the judiciary was under sttack in the state from ""self appointed and so called champions of human rights"" and said that this was being done with the help of ""a section of the media"". He said: ""Such activities raise serious doubts about the intentions of such groups which cannot even accept a constitutionally elected democratic government"". Modi told the President that a judicial commission headed by a retired judge of the Supreme Court has been appointed to inquire into all aspects of the communal riots, but added that ""efforts are being made to cast aspersions on the commission and its work through propaganda"". Seeking the President's ""knowledge, wisdom and perspective"" to guide him, the chief minister elaborated on Gujarat's contribution to the national economy by giving figures of the Planning Commission and also citing some initiatives taken by the state government in sectors of water and girls' eduction. He however added that ""vested interests"" were trying to obstruct the path of progress of Gujarat. ""They are identifying stray incidents and exaggerating them with the sole objective of slowing down the pace of development"".

26,Minister apologises for unpatriotic term,"BANGALORE: The Legislative Assembly on Tuesday witnessed emotional exchanges and high drama after urban development minister D K Shivakumar accused BJP members of being unpatriotic. The enraged BJP members staged a dharna in the well of the House, demanding an apology from the minister, even as Shivakumar stuck to his stand and refused to withdraw his words. Law and parliamentary affairs minister D B Chandre Gowda tried to manage the situation by stating: ""The government expresses regret that the opposition is hurt,"" but since Shivakumar remained recalcitrant, the BJP members declined to return to their seats. The ruckus happened after Araga Jnanendra (BJP) raised the issue of Narayan of Moovalli village in his constituency, who has returned home after being a prisoner in Pakistan for 21 years. ""Your government was magnanimous enough to give a bouquet and express sympathy for a little child from Pakistan. Please extend this to Narayan,"" he said. Shivakumar, however, interrupted him as soon as he mentioned Pakistan. ""You are accusing us of supporting Pakistan? We are not unpatriotic, you are,"" he said in a raised voice. Opposition leader Jagadish Shettar and MLAs Vishweshwar Hegde Kageri and S Suresh Kumar stated: ""You cannot accuse us of being unpatriotic. This is an insult to our constituents."" Even as deputy speaker Manohar H Tahsildar tried in vain to control the situation. Jnanendra and Kumar demanded that the records be read out to show that the BJP was not accusing the government of conniving with Pakistan. ""I do not know under what daze the minister was in. I was only appreciating the government's magnanimity,"" Jnanendra maintained. S S Patil (AIPJD) felt that Shivakumar's remark was uncalled for, even as the other AIPJD members remained silent. P G R Sindhia (JDU) suggested that the remarks be expunged. The BJP members went to the well and staged a dharna declaring that unless Shivakumar withdrew his remarks, they would not return to their seats and the row continued till Tahsildar adjourned the House for lunch. The argument carried after lunch as well. Nearly after an hour of arguments, Chief Minister S M Krishna intervened and said: ""What has happened from morning is very unfortunate. Enemies and unpatriotic are terms that are available in the dictionary. We need not give any importance to such terms."" Justifying the state government's gesture in treating Pakistani child Noor Fatima, Krishna said: ""It is in our culture to serve those who are suffering, irrespective of which ever country they come from. We have adopted a humanitarian approach to the whole issue."" An emotional Shivakumar quickly got up and said: ""If I have hurt anyone's feelings, I apologise."" Following the minister's apology, BJP members withdrew their dharna.

27,State govt blamed for water crisis,"GUNTUR: Leaders at an-all party meeting held here on Tuesday have blamed the state government for the present water crisis, which hit the delta areas in the district. They alleged that the inconsistent and impractical policies of the government have contributed to the shortage of water to the delta.

Rayapati Srinivas criticising the government said that it could not escape from its accountability just by saying that the water shortage was due to the drought conditions. He said that it was the duty of the government to asses the situation prior to the crisis and make alternative arrangements if it was sincere to protect the farmers' interests. He demanded that the water released to the Krishna Western delta should be increased to save the fertile delta lands from becoming barren lands.

29,Gujarat govt reduces court fees,"GANDHINAGAR: The Gujarat government on Tuesday issued a government resolution reducing court fees charged for seven different categories of applications placed in the court. The reduction came after negotiations with the Gujarat Bar Council and other lawyers' associations, following a series of agitations and strikes rocking the state's courts. The fees had been raised under the Bombay Court Fees (Gujarat Amendment) Bill, 2003, passed in the state assembly on March 27. Sachivalaya bureaucrats consider this as a precursor to the state coming in to populist pressure. On Wednesday, crucial negotations are to begin with farmers' organisations for reducing the power tariffs, hiked 2.5 times a few weeks ago. With the court fees having gone down, expectations ran high that the farmers too would be obliged similarly. State law minister Ashok Bhatt told newspersons that ""the representations for reducing the fees court made by the Bar Council and other lawyers' groups have been accepted in toto"", despite the fact that the upward revision, made four months ago, was the ""lowest in the country."" He added, ""We held two round of discussions, with the last round being on July 22."" However, Bhatt did not say how the reduction would affect the state coffers. The reduced fees, on an average, are 50 per cent to 75 per cent lower than what they were when fixed, after an unpward revision effected in several decades, in March 2003. In the case of the applications or petitions presented to any officer of the excise department, a magistrate, a land revenue officer, a municipal commissioner, or a civil, criminal or revenue court, the fees have been reduced from Rs 10 to Rs 3. A similar reduction has been effected for the applications or petitions containing a complaint or charge of an offence presented to a criminal, civil or revenue court, a collector or revenue officer. The applications or petitions presented to a competent authority for the purpose of obtaining a certificate of domicile would now invite a court fees of Rs 10 instead of Rs 50, fixed in March. The application or petition presented to the chief controlling revenue or executive authority would invite a fees of Rs 25 instead of Rs 100. Applications for probate or letters of administration for revocation thereof under the Indian Succession Act, for a certificate under part X of the Indian Succession Act, 1925, and for the opinion or advice from a trust or for the appointment of new trustees, the fees has been reduced from Rs 25 to Rs 20, Rs 50 to Rs 40 and Rs 100 to Rs 50 respectively. Significantly, the court fees increase and the power tariff hike were part of of the recommendations made by the Manu Shroff committee in 2000-end ago on raising user charges across the board for earning non-tax revenues as a means to resource mobilisation. The non-tax revenues had remained stagnant for several years. The Manu Shroff committee had also recommended raising the use charges for health, education, water, irrigation, public transport and other government facilities as part of the attempt to bring down government subsidy to different social sectors. Agitations are already on against the increase in the higher education fees, increased recently. Analysts wonder whether other revisions will now take place at all.

35,Two ministers booed at while on inspection tour,"NEW DELHI: Two Union ministers of state faced an angry slogan-shouting crowd on Tuesday evening while on a routine inspection visit and had to flee the spot without accepting ""felicitations"" from the local residents' association. Bandaru Dattatreya, Minister of State for Railways, and Delhi's own Vijay Goel, MoS for Youth Affairs and Sports, were to ""take a round of New Delhi railway station, Paharganj side, Railway Colony (Basant Lane) and Vishwa Karma Mandir to inspect cleanliness"", according to a railway ministry press release. But there was no word from the Railways after the visit. According to eye-witnesses, it could be due to a hostile crowd which booed the ministers who came to inspect cleanliness. ""When the entourage walked across the road from the railway station into the lane, the place was stinking of urine. The LIG-type houses in the Railway Colony were in a dilapidated condition,"" said a Northern Railway official. Apparently the ministers were stopped by a crowd that was not impressed by their promises, old and new. They reminded Goel that Nitish Kumar had visited the area earlier and nothing much had changed in the workers' colony. The minister assured the residents that this time around their complaints would be looked into. But the angry crowd would have nothing of it and did not allow the VIPs to move any further. The entourage could not reach the dais erected to felicitate them and left in a huff. Both the ministers were not available for comment. And the official version of the incident, according to Northern Railway sources, is that there was an altercation between one of the ministers and a railway union leader which led to slogan-shouting by the leaders' followers. The ministers also inspected a temple and wanted it to be spruced up and a hoarding removed so that passengers could see the temple as they get out of the New Delhi railway station. When a Railway Protection Force official reminded the ministers that the temple stood on railway land, he was promptly made to shut up.

36,NGOs to counsel riot victims,"AHMEDABAD: To avoid a repeat of the Best Bakery case, which fell apart as witnesses turned hostile, an NGO here has decided to counsel riot victims on what to do when asked to give evidence in courts or before a riot inquiry commission. Activists of Action Aid, an NGO working with the riot affected victims in Naroda, Vatwa, Shahpur, Dariapur and other areas, have decided to provide victims support and guidelines while deposing.

Former Miss India and social activist Nafisa Ali, who is the brand ambassador of Action Aid, was here to share her views and oversee rehabilitation work. She said the Best Bakery case should be tried outside Gujarat as it had failed to provide a secure environment for the victims to speak fearlessly.

37,"Oppn, BJP clash over NHRC move","NEW DELHI: The Lok Sabha witnessed a prolonged and noisy clash between the Opposition and the BJP members on Tuesday. The former accused the ruling party of targeting a constitutional body like the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) after it petitioned the Supreme Court for a re-trial of the Best Bakery case outside Gujarat. Agitated BJP members were on their feet soon after Samajwadi Party's Ramjilal Suman raised the matter during Zero Hour, resulting in a continuous slanging match as charges and counter-charges flew thick and fast. Suman said ever since the NHRC moved the SC in the Best Bakery case, in which all the 21 accused were acquitted, top BJP leaders had targeted the commission, even going to the extent of calling it ''anti-Hindu''. Suman said BJP chief Venkaiah Naidu, party spokesman V K Malhotra and Gujarat CM Narendra Modi had not just attacked a constitutional body, but also said that the NHRC's petition seeking a re-trial outside Gujarat posed ''a serious threat to the country's federal structure''. He demanded that the party tender an apology to the commission. Suman was supported by CPM members Rupchand Pal and Basudev Acharia, who said that the NHRC was within its rights to seek a fresh trial of the accused outside Gujarat as the victims were not getting justice in the state. Responding to the Opposition charges, BJP's chief whip V K Malhotra said it was true that he had condemned the NHRC for this decision, adding: ''I stand by it.'' He said seeking a re-trial outside Gujarat amounted to expressing ''no confidence'' in the Gujarat High Court. He said, this would set a wrong precedent and have an adverse impact on the country's federal structure. Malhotra said if the Best Bakery case was tried outside, then the Marad riot case, in which eight were killed, should also be transferred outside Kerala. Malhotra also pointed out that the Sikh Forum had asked the NHRC to take a fresh look at the 1984 anti-Sikh riots in which several Congress leaders were allegedly involved, but nothing was done.

38,TDP not in favour of combined elections,"HYDERABAD: Contrary to the desire of its ally the BJP, the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) is not too keen that parliamentary and Andhra Pradesh Assembly elections should be held together. Sources in the TDP said on Tuesday that party president Chandrababu Naidu reportedly expressed this opinion to Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani when he met the latter in New Delhi last week. Several other TDP leaders are against BJP president M Venkaiah Naidu's proposition that Assembly elections in the state be held simultaneously with Lok Sabha elections. However, TDP MP Umareddy Venkateswarlu told reporters on Tuesday that the party was ready for elections whenever they are held __ in February 2004 or September 2004. But he made it clear that the party will not take the lead in suggesting an election date on its own. ""The Election Commission is the rightful authority to decide on the date of elections in the state. Our cadres are geared up for elections. The date is of no consequence,"" he said. He said the view expressed by Venkaiah Naidu was the BJP's opinion and not a consensual statement on behalf of all NDA allies. As a general proposition, Venkateswarlu said, holding simultaneous polls to the Lok Sabha and state assemblies was a good idea as it would save money. But it should not militate against the local aspirations of the people, he said.

43,Victim's family blames in-laws,"NEW DELHI: A 30-year-old woman's charred body was reportedly found in Gujranwala Town late on Sunday night. The incident took a controversial turn with the police registering a case of abetment to suicide, even as the victim's family insists that the girl was burnt to death by her in-laws. The victim's husband, Kamal Sodhi, a businessman has been arrested. The police said, Manju Sodhi committed suicide by setting herself afire around midnight on Sunday. ''There had apparently been problems between the couple. The victim possibly committed suicide due to these differences,'' a police official said. The version given by the victim's family, however, is rather different. Manju's elder sister Mamta Kapoor alleged that the incident was being brushed under the carpet as a case of suicide. ''We received a call from Manju's sister-in-law around one am on Monday. She told us that Manju had just set herself afire. But when we reached there 45 minutes later, the body was already gone cold,'' she said. Mamta further added that her sister, married for 13 years, had been tortured for dowry right from the start. The victim's family claimed that Manju had been very disturbed over the last month. ''We thought things would improve with time, but that didn't happen. Manju was also being forced to take anti-depressant tablets two-three times a day by her in-laws,'' said the victim's father, Om Prakash Sabarwal. Manju's elder sister apparently spoke to the victim a day before the incident. ''She was sounding scared. She told me that her husband's family made her sign a blank piece of paper. Manju told me that she would leave a document at a nearby shop for me to pick up, but her in-laws should not get to know of it,'' Mamta said. According to a senior police official, the victim suffered hundred per cent burns. The autopsy report is awaited.
