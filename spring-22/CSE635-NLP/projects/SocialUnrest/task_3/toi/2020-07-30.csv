0,Crowds disperse as videographers arrive to record scenes of violence,"MUMBAI: Stray acts of violence and stone-throwing marred Wednesdayâ€™s bandh led to four BEST drivers being injured and 40 buses damaged during Wednesdayâ€™s bandh called jointly by the Shiv Sena and its ally, the BJP to protest the bomb blast in a BEST bus at Ghatkopar on Monday.

TNN correspondents covering the bandh witnessed protestors in Lalbaug stopping a Fiat (BLN-1358), jumping on its roof and manhandling the driver. They also damaged the windscreen of a blue Mitsubishi Lancer MH-31AG 7027). A constable accompanying Kalachowkie police stationâ€™s senior inspect Prakash Bhosale was overheard informing the control room over the wireless, â€œSagla shant aahe Everything is peaceful).â€™â€™

Protesters threw stones at local trains in Ghatkopar and Kurla, and food stalls were vandalised at the Santa Cruz, Jogeshwari and Wadala stations. In addition, hundreds of activists blocked traffic on the Western and Eastern Express highways and the arterial S.V. Road and L.B.S. Marg.

In another incident in the Parel area, a plumbing contractor, Hussein Khargonewala, was attacked by Sainiks as he was travelling in a scooter from Dadar to Byculla. Five persons manhandled him and damaged his scooter. The policemen present at the spot rescued Mr Khargonewala but did not take any action against the assailants.

At S.V. Road, Goregaon, activists held up vehicles and damaged them while the police stood by and watched. However, when more police personnel arrived, along with a videographer, the crowd dispersed.All over the city, the police used videographers to record the protest, so that action could subsequently be taken against miscreants.

Several state transport buses, private vehicles and trucks were stranded on the Jogeshwari flyover after their tyres were deflated. Vijay Gaikwad, a Borivli-Pune bus driver, told TNN at about 1 p.m. that he had been stuck since 9:30 a.m.

Among those stranded was a man who was driving down from the airport to the US consulate. When joint commissioner of police Satyapal Singh stopped by on his rounds at Kherwadi, the anxious man pleaded with him to get him to the consulate somehow since a larger mob was waiting just a few hundred metres ahead.

Earlier, the police had to intervene when the crowd stopped a taxi with foreign tourist and started breaking the windows and manhandling the driver, said the stranded man who refused to identify himself.

At Mulund station, former MLC Shishir Shinde and his team successfully blocked trains for over an hour from 8.30 a.m. The Bangalorebound Udyan Express was allowed to pass after a delay of 45 minutes. At Suman Nagar junction in Chembur, Sena leader Suryakant Mahadik led a mob that halted road traffic for a short time. With timely police intervention, the mob dispersed.

The Sena-BJP bandh call evoked a near-total response in Thane, except in Bhiwandi. Barring a stray incident of stone pelting, the bandh went off peacefully. Shiv Sena activists, led by party Rajya Sabha member Satish Pradhan, held a rail roko.

1,Green flutters with saffron on bandh day,"MUMBAI: The Shiv Senaâ€™s saffron flags fluttered alongside the green banners of several Muslim organisations at a dharna in the minority-dominated Bhendi Bazaar area on Wednesday.

Condemning Mondayâ€™s Ghatkopar bus blast as an â€œact of cowardiceâ€™â€™, the gathering pledged work together to ensure peace in the city.

Donning black head-bands, about a hundred Muslims gathered near the Bhendi Bazaar police chowky to express their support for the bandh called by the Sena-BJP combine.

Their claim was buttressed by the fact that most shops, barring a few chemistsâ€™ shops, small restaurants and hawkersâ€™ stalls in the area, remained closed throughout the day. Protestors also burned an effigy of a terrorist to drive home their point.

Summing up Mondayâ€™s bomb blast as an attempt to create a rift between Hindus and Muslims, Muslim Council president Ibrahim Tai said, â€œIn Kashmir, terrorists kill people to achieve their goal of capturing the Valley. Here, the terroristsâ€™ acts have no motive to achieve except to create communal discord.â€™â€™

Thanking the Muslim organisations for supporting the bandh, Bala Nandgaonkar, Sena MLA from nearby Mazgaon, said, â€œTerrorists and bombs donâ€™t differentiate between Hindus and Muslims. The only way to combat them effectively is to join hands and fight.â€™â€™

He said the support for the bandh was a clear indication that the minorities did not perceive the Shiv Sena as anti-Muslim. â€œWe have to fight those against the country,â€™â€™ he said. Several other Sainiks also participated in the dharna. The Senaâ€™s presence at the dharna did lead hushed exchanges at the gathering.

Members of the Muslim Mahila Mandal join in a dharna organised by various Muslim bodies at Bhendi Bazaar on Wednesday to condemn the Ghatkopar bomb blast.

2,Plot holders upset with govt. decision,"PUNE: Owners of small plots are up in arms over the state government''s decision not to register purchase deeds if the plots have not been independently measured and do not have non-agriculture (NA) and urban land ceiling (ULC) certificates.

Approximately 1.50 lakh property transactions have been lying unregistered due to the decision, which was issued through a notification on September 18, 2002. As a result, the revenue earned through purchase deed registration has reportedly gone down by 40 per cent.

Addressing a news conference on Wednesday,D.B. Khaladkar, convenor of the newly-formed Gharkul Panchayat, an association of the affected people, said that the decision has hit the middleand lower-middle-class people who have purchased small plots of land.

""Most of them have bought small portions of bigger plots, but could not get them measured as there is no government machinery to do the job,"" Khaladkar said. Ironically, their names have been put in the 7/12 extract as joint owners, he added.

Khaladkar pointed out that it takes close to two years to get an NA certificate and people usually start building houses on the plots after applying for NA. ""Even getting the ULC certificate takes two months,"" he said.

Khaladkar asked why the government was insisting on the ULC certificate when it is planning to scrap the act.

Khaladkar demanded that the government should first measure the plots and issue the NA certificates before stopping registration of the purchase deeds. The procedures need to be simplified as well, he suggested. He has urged the government to give time to the plot holders to procure the required documents. ""Lack of flexibility in the matter would deprive people of the right to build homes on the plots or sell them,"" he observed.

3,Police order arrest of RJD MP Shahabuddin,"PATNA: In what came as a major embarrassment to the ruling RJD in Bihar, the state police on Wednesday ordered the arrest of RJD MP Mohd Shahabuddin and five others against whom a warrant has been issued in connection with a kidnapping case.

State DGP D P Ojha has also directed the investigating officer (IO) of the case to probe whether junior minister for welfare Ejazul Haque, a close relative of the MP, was part of the conspiracy behind the kidnapping. The police headquarters has also directed the Siwan SP and the Special Task Force (STF) SP to provide all assistance and help to ensure the execution of the warrant at the earliest.

The kidnapping case IO, Shivnath Chaudhary, has also been asked to approach the commissioner, Delhi police, and request him to arrest the MP who might be in Delhi attending the Lok Sabha currently in session. In case of the police failure to arrest him in Delhi, the IO has been asked to conduct raids at all the known places of his stay.

Also, steps should then be initiated to attach the MPâ€™s property under Sections 82 and 83 CrPC, the IO has been told. The state police spokesman, Rituraj, said the DGP has ordered withdrawal of all the bodyguards provided to the MP. Nine security personnel of the state police are currently attached with him. As many as 38 cases are pending against Shahabuddin. He has been chargesheeted in 26 of these cases. While the CBI is probing the case of murder of former JNU Studentsâ€™ Union president Chandrashekhar, the state CID is investigating seven cases. Police have also urged the court to reopen nine cases of Shahabuddin in which he has been acquitted.

In all he has been exonerated in 14 cases. During investigation it was found that witnesses in such cases were hostile or failed to turn up. The DGP, in a letter to home commissioner B K Haldar on Wednesday, urged him to transfer all cases of Shahabuddin from Siwan to Patna for speedy trial. Giving details of the kidnapping case in which orders have been issued to arrest Shahabuddin, Rituraj said the MP and five others were main accused in the case of kidnapping of one Munna Chaudhary, a CPI-ML supporter. Chaudharyâ€™s mother had lodged an FIR at the Siwan Mufassil police station on January 13, 2001.

4,CGHS curbs on govt. employees stayed,"PUNE: Additional director of the central government health scheme (CGHS),

Pune, R.A. Prabhakar on Wednesday stayed the implementation of his July 16 directive preventing central government employees and pensioners from approaching private CGHS-recognised hospitals for routine consultation, following an intense agitation by the beneficiaries.

Over 300 central government employees and pensioners, affiliated to 24 unions in central excise, income-tax, film archive and defence accounts departments and the Confederation of Central Government Employees and Workers, gheraoed Prabhakar for over an hour on Wednesday afternoon, demanding withdrawal of the order.

He was told that private recognised hospitals had completely stopped treating CGHS beneficiaries in the light of the order, although the restriction was only on routine consultation.

It may be noted that The Times of India had, in its issue dated July 26 (CGHS shock for government employees), reported the discontent among central government employees and pensioners over the directive. Central government workers had complained that CGHS beneficiaries were being referred to Sassoon general hospital and not to the 49 private recognised hospitals following the new directive.

Prabhakar told TNN that he had stayed the order in view of the strong protests.He claimed that he had not issued any directive but had merely circulated the minutes of a meeting of chief medical officers and top CGHS officials from Delhi.

He said that the Delhi officials had insisted that routine consultations should be done only at government hospitals.

""I have conveyed the feelings of people to the officials and have sought further clarification in the matter. Till such time as we get any feedback, the status quo ante existing on July 15 regarding medical treatment and reference to private recognised hospitals will continue,"" Prabhakar clarified. He has, accordingly, also given instructions in writing to all seven CGHS dispensaries and polyclinic.

Harish Radhakrishnan, head of the coordination committee of health affairs in the employees'' confederation, said that the Sassoon hospital was already overburdened.

""Such restrictions are fine in a place like Delhi, where they have over 25 government hospitals,"" he observed.

5,Para incident leaves some points to ponder,"Lucknow: Even as the Para incident sparked a debate whether young students should be made part of a violent agitation against pathetic civic amenities by school management without the consent of their parents, police tracing the antecedents of the principal of St Maryâ€™s School discovered that this was not the first time that John Augustine had gone to jail.

He has two other criminal cases to his discredit, including that of land grabbing and electricity theft. In one of these, cases he had been sent to jail.

The belief that young students should not be made tools of murky small-time politics is gaining ground as many parents had stepped out before the police to lodge complaints against the school authorities. What had added fuel to the fire is the revelation that Father John Augustine was arrested in connection with a criminal case lodged with the Hazratganj and another case was lodged with with the Talkatora police in January this year.

In the Hazratganj case, Father John Augustine was accused of land grabbing along with an associate and was arrested on September 10, 2001. Apart from the electricity theft case lodged with the Talkatora in January this year, he now has to his discredit a total of four criminal cases as the two fresh ones comprising one related to attack on the police and another related to violation of the Railway Act by obstructing train traffic.

Such details doing the round among local residents and parents of the students had led to a fresh wave of resentment against the school management which had earlier been charged with instigating the naive students to indulge in violence.

Meanwhile, the State Minorities Commission has constituted an inquiry committee to be headed by Renuka Deen, a member of the commission. In the first phase of conducting the inquiry, she recorded the statements of Father John Augustine and Sapna Chatterjee on Wednesday.

6,"No water for crops, says govt","HYDERABAD: With water level in the reservoirs in the Krishna basin still at an abysmal low, the government has advised farmers to go in for rain-fed crops and promised to provide necessary seeds at subsidised prices.

â€œThe Srisailam and Nagarjuna Sagar reservoirs alone require 500 tmc ft water. The two major sources will get water only after Almatti and Narayanpur in Karnataka are filled to capacity. Hence, the government has decided to advice farmers not to pin hopes on securing water from the river Krishna,â€� major irrigation minister Kadiam Srihari said at a press conference on Wednesday.

About 38 lakh acres were being cultivated under the Krishna river basin with Nagarjuna Sagar alone accounting for 22 lakh acres.

Farmers in the Krishna delta are agitating for the release of water, but the government has ruled out supplying water until the reservoirs are filled to capacity.

The minister assured the farming community that the government would release water to even rain-fed crops if the reservoirs fill up and will even advance the rabi season.

He said chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu reviewed the developments in the Krishna basin on Wednesday and directed officials of the irrigation and agriculture departments to monitor the situation closely.

The minister said catchment areas of the river Krishna in Karnataka witnessed about 40 to 50 per cent deficit rainfall and the neighbouring state would not release water until its reservoir fill up.

â€œAlmatti and Narayanpur can store another 38 tmc ft water. Given the current inflows into the river Krishna, it might take another four to five days to reach maximum capacity. Karnataka will release water into Krishna only thereafter.â€�

He said only 10 per cent water was available in Srisailam, while Nagarjuna Sagar has only 40 per cent water.

Though the state received more than the normal rainfall, the minister said reservoirs, minor and medium irrigation tanks were still dry. He said water would be released from Sriramsagar and Jurala from August 1 onwards.

8,Terrorism part of Pak's state policy: Advani,"NEW DELHI: In an oblique attack on Pakistan, Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani on Thursday said it has made terrorism a part of its state policy threatening peace and development within that country itself.

""Today terrorism has emerged as the most potent foe of peace, development, freedom and social harmony in all the countries that it has targeted,"" Advani said while addressing a national seminar on Development as Freedom-an India Perspective.

""Indeed, it (terrorism) has threatened and jeopardised peace, development, freedom, democracy and social tranquility even in the country in our neighbourhood, which has made terrorism a part of its state policy,"" he said without taking Pakistan''s name.

He said the biggest threat to India''s external and internal security is cross-border terrorism, fuelled by religious extremism.

""It would have been more appropriate for me to speak after hearing Professor Amartya Sen but five persons have been killed in a blast in Bombay (Mumbai), at the very outset I may have to say something in Parliament,"" Advani said.

It is our resolve to crush terrorism and protect our people as well as protect the gains of our freedom and development, the Deputy Prime Minister said.

12,Asif Ali Zardari acquitted in suicide cases,"ISLAMABAD: Former Pakistani premier Benazir Bhutto''s husband Asif Ali Zardari has been acquitted on the last of the two cases aginst him for attempting to commit suicide, and the magistrate has said he may be released from prison if not required in any other case.

Zardari smiled with relief as the Judicial Magistrate Syeda Perveen Shah on Wednesday delivered the order in Central Prison, on an application filed by his counsel Shahadat Awan.

Shah observed that there was no possibility of the conviction of the accused as the prosecution agency itself had admitted that the case was false.

The accused may be released forthwith if not required in any other case, the judge ordered.

The former parliamentarian was arrested in 1996 after the dismissal of Benazir''s government by the then President Farooq Leghari. He was booked on May 19, 1999, by Karachi Police for attempting to commit suicide while in custody.

His counsel said Zardari was subjected to torture during police custody and he received injuries to his tongue, adding the police concocted the entire story to escape the criminal liability of torturing an accused in custody.

He alleged the case was an outcome of political victimisation, to demolish the image of Bhutto''s Pakistan People''s Party.

State counsel Mohammed Ismail opposed the acquittal, saying that it was premature to allow the defence counsel''s application.

Zardari is still facing trial in 14 cases. Earlier on July 9, the same magistrate had acquitted him in another case on attempt to commit suicide.

""Is the Congress opposed to the Naga peace process?"" he asked, referring to the fact that the BJP-led NDA government''s representatives had been in regular touch with the NSCN(M) in a bid to bring peace to Nagaland.

""To allege that we are compromising the country''s security interests (by talking to the NSCN(M)) is unfair,"" he said.

15,ABVP slams govt over fee hike,"MANGALORE: The Akhila Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad on Thursday slammed the state government for increasing fees of professional courses ''exorbitantly''.

Speaking to reporters, ABVP state Secretary Vishwanath Pai noted that instead of filing an appeal against the proposed fee by the high court, the state was justifying the fee structure in the Supreme Court. Pai said by denying the SC/ST students seats, the government was shying away from social justice.

Pai said that after the ABVP''s July 23 protest, Chief Minister S M Krishna has said the governent''s priority was mid-day meals and primary education.

""If the government has no say or is not interested in higher education, why have a minister and a department for the same?"" Pai said.

To protest against the state government''s policy and to urge for a suitable policy to enable poor afford professional education, the ABVP would be sending an e-mail to President A P J Abdul Kalam and post one lakh post cards to the President as well as Supreme Court judges.

Pai also said the Mangalore University was commercialising higher education by increasing the fee ten-fold. He said while the earlier course fee for post graduate courses was Rs 1,850, this year it was about Rs 10,700.

16,Gujarat government to study NHRC appeal,"GANDHINAGAR: The Gujarat government will ""study the legality"" of the National Human Rights Commission''s (NHRC) petition in the Supreme Court for reopening the Best Bakery case and the plea for holding the trial of other communal riot cases outside the state.

Talking to newspersons here on Thursday, government spokesperson I K Jadeja said, ""We have still not received a copy of the NHRC''s special leave petition. It would be premature to say anything on the issue. On getting it, we will call for a legal view and react appropriately.""

Taking a more forthright stand, Minister of State for Home Amit Shah objected to the NHRC''s appeal for holding trial of the riot cases outside Gujarat.

""If this happens, it will open up a Pandora''s box. Hundred of other cases may also be reopened outside the state,"" he said.

Meanwhile, clear indications have emerged in the Sachivalaya that after the NHRC move, pressure on the state government had considerably increased to prove that its investigation agencies were impartial in probing riot cases.

Even while awaiting a ""political decision"" over going into appeal in the high court, officials are learnt to have started examining the implications of the Vadodara special sessions verdict and the government''s report on the Best Bakery case.

""We may decide on an appeal after thoroughly studying the judgement and the public prosecutor''s suggestions in the matter,"" a senior official conceded. State Law Minister Ashok Bhatt was not available for comment.

18,CMC posts 23 pc increase in net profit,"HYDERABAD: CMC Ltd, a leading software company, has recorded a 23 per cent rise in net profit at Rs 8. 15 crore for the quarter ended June, 2003 compared to Rs 6.64 crore posted in the same period of last year.

The unaudited financial results, described by company officials as the best first quarterly results, also saw CMC''s revenues surge 63 per cent to Rs 159.26 crore compared to Rs 97.71 crore posted in the corresponding period last year. The Tata-owned company''s performance was driven by customer services, Indonet (a strategic business unit), and international business despite being pitted against a sluggish economy, S S Ghosh, CMC''s CEO and managing director told reporters on Thursday.

CMC has also bagged new orders of Rs 185 crore in the period under review compared to the Rs 86 crore worth orders booked in the same period last year, he said.

CMC, which plans to recruit around 300 people this year, witnessed its nt value addition per person increasing by 9 per cent. The company also would try to restrict its debt, which is at Rs 48 crore as on June, 2003. ""That we were able to bring down the debt from Rs 52 crore in March this year is a good sign. Despite businesses being dependent on borrowings, we will ensure that there is no a significant jump in debt,"" said J K Gupta, CMC''s chief financial officer.

Without giving a performance guidance for the next quarter due to challenges like pricing pressures, Ghosh said CMC would augment growth by leveraging its domain skills to provide IT-centric solutions. Besides exploiting the synergy between its own knowledge base and group company Tata Consultancy Services for geographical expansion, CMC would also focus on value-added services by integrating end-to-end solutions according to clients'' needs.

The company, which has set up a market in Dubai to target the Middle East and African markets, is also looking at the south east Asian economies. Investments, which will add to 5 per cent of total revenues, will be spend on infrastructure network and manpower training, particularly in ITeS, said Ghosh.

19,Doctors to part with salary if govt employees do so,"CHANDIGARH: Miffed at the decision of the Punjab government for abolishing their non-practising allowance (NPA) with effect from Friday, doctors have agreed in principle to ""part with their pay"" if the decision is taken for all government employees. A section of Punjab doctors based here have forwarded the proposal to chief minister Amarinder Singh.

""If the government is passing through financial crunch, we are willing to part with our pay if the decision is taken for all government employees. Instead of abolishing NPA which would entail saving of a meagre Rs 23 crore, the various fringe benefits given to other Class I employees should be withdrawn,"" notes a Punjab doctor on deputation to Chandigarh.

Punjab Civil Medical Services Association general secretary Dr Manjit Singh too seconds their proposal. ""Our colleagues in Chandigarh have forwarded a proposal to the chief minister. If there is a financial crunch, why is it that only doctors are being targeted? Uniform policy should be followed for all employees,"" he says.

Lauding the ""principled decision"" taken by Himachal Pradesh chief minister Virbhadra Singh of not withdrawing NPA for Himachal doctors in the ""interest of the public"" he adds: ""Himachal does not have its own Pay Commission and always follows Punjab. However, Virbhadra has taken a principled decision of not withdrawing NPA. We strongly support this. Instead of awarding dishonest officers by abolishing NPA and allowing private practice, Punjab should take stringent measures against doctors indulging in malpractices.""

Highlighting the â€˜step-motherly treatment'' meted out to PCMS doctors, a senior doctor says, ""As against the PCMS cadre strength of 4100, only 45 are promotional posts. There is virtually no promotional avenue for nearly 99 per cent doctors, as a result of which they join and retire from the same posts. This is in sharp contrast with the time-bound promotional avenues available to other officers. For doctors who work against all odds, withdrawal of NPA is uncalled for. Who will compensate for the unprecedented stagnation in the cadre?""

Adds another doctor: ""PCMS doctors are the most disadvantaged of all categories of Class I officers. We are the only officers who have not been provided fringe benefits that are available to others including government vehicle, telephone at home and office and personal staff. Many of us don''t even have a designated place to sit in the hospital.""

20,Magsaysay for Lyngdoh: Modi govt sees red,"GANDHINAGAR: The Gujarat government has not taken kindly to the news of Chief Election Commissioner J M Lyngdoh bagging the prestigious Magsaysay award, called the Nobel prize of Asia.

Chief Minister Narendra Modi, who targeted Lyngdoh''s religious background during his pre-poll speeches, told his officials that there was no need to issue a statement congratulating the CEC, said a source close to the CM.

A top CM confidante, pleading anonymity, said, ""The Magsaysay award is meant for only people like Lyngdoh. Baba Amte, who championed the cause of the lepers, was never remembered for the good work he was doing. However, the moment he identified himself with Gujarat''s opponent, Medha Patkar, he was given the Magsaysay award."" He added, ""We all know how the awardees are selected. There is nothing new.""

Minister of State for Home Amit Shah, known for his closeness to the CM, denied it was only because of Lyngdoh that free and fair polls were held.

""I think, it was mainly because Gujarat government officials worked impartially that the state witnessed peaceful polls in December 2002. And the state''s political parties fully cooperated with them. Surely, such a situation would not arise in Bihar.""

Refusing to take such an aggressive stand, government spokesperson I K Jadeja, however, evaded a comment on the award.

""There is nothing to say in the matter. He has got the award. It''s fact,"" he said.

Officials in the CM office, too, took a cautious view. A CMO bureaucrat said it was ""good"" that Lyngdoh, an ex-IAS officer, had got the award. However, he did not wish to go into the merit of the CEC having held a free and fair poll.

Yet, there were dissenting voices among Cabinet ministers as well as BJP MLAs. Especially state Water Supplies Minister Narottam Patel, known for his closeness to Union Textile Minister Kashiram Rana, said he was glad that Lyngdoh had got the award.

""Despite whatever had happened, it is a fact that under him free and fair polls took place in both Gujarat and J&K. We won the polls with a thumping majority. I will personally congratulate him. One should admit what''s good in a man.""

Taking a similar view, state Revenue Minister Kaushik Patel recalled how impartial Lyngdoh was, though careful enough not to take the CEC''s name.

""All good men should be awarded. One should remember the Digvijay Singh government in Madhya Pradesh was indicted for its failure to impartially revise the electoral rolls,"" the senior minister underlined.

BJP MLA Sunil Oza insisted, ""We should be grateful to Lyngdoh for conducting impartial polls. We won 127 seats in the state Assembly. Why should one be afraid of admitting what''s a fact?""

But he added, ""It''s because the BJP cooperated fully with Lyngdoh that the polls were held peacefully.""

The state''s powerful IAS bureaucracy has been mum on the issue, though Lyngdoh was a 1961 IAS batch officer. A spokesperson for the IAS Association said, ""We have still not held consultations.""

The Association had protested against Lyngdoh''s alleged rude behaviour towards Vadodara Collector Bhagyesh Zha, snubbed as ""joker"" for failing replies on Best Bakery case.

When contacted, then state Chief Secretary G Subba Rao, one of the persons who was criticised by Lyngdoh during the polls, said he did not wish to say anything about CEC getting award.

""I am currently chairman of the Gujarat Electricity Regulatory Commission. It''s a semi-judicial body. Hence, it would be improper to say anything in the matter,"" he said.

21,Magsaysay for Lyngdoh: Modi govt sees red,"GANDHINAGAR: The Gujarat government has not taken kindly to the news of Chief Election Commissioner J M Lyngdoh bagging the prestigious Magsaysay award, called the Nobel prize of Asia.

Chief Minister Narendra Modi, who targeted Lyngdoh''s religious background during his pre-poll speeches, told his officials that there was no need to issue a statement congratulating the CEC, said a source close to the CM.

A top CM confidante, pleading anonymity, said, ""The Magsaysay award is meant for only people like Lyngdoh. Baba Amte, who championed the cause of the lepers, was never remembered for the good work he was doing. However, the moment he identified himself with Gujarat''s opponent, Medha Patkar, he was given the Magsaysay award."" He added, ""We all know how the awardees are selected. There is nothing new.""

Minister of State for Home Amit Shah, known for his closeness to the CM, denied it was only because of Lyngdoh that free and fair polls were held.

""I think, it was mainly because Gujarat government officials worked impartially that the state witnessed peaceful polls in December 2002. And the state''s political parties fully cooperated with them. Surely, such a situation would not arise in Bihar.""

Refusing to take such an aggressive stand, government spokesperson I K Jadeja, however, evaded a comment on the award.

""There is nothing to say in the matter. He has got the award. It''s fact,"" he said.

Officials in the CM office, too, took a cautious view. A CMO bureaucrat said it was ""good"" that Lyngdoh, an ex-IAS officer, had got the award. However, he did not wish to go into the merit of the CEC having held a free and fair poll.

Yet, there were dissenting voices among Cabinet ministers as well as BJP MLAs. Especially state Water Supplies Minister Narottam Patel, known for his closeness to Union Textile Minister Kashiram Rana, said he was glad that Lyngdoh had got the award.

""Despite whatever had happened, it is a fact that under him free and fair polls took place in both Gujarat and J&K. We won the polls with a thumping majority. I will personally congratulate him. One should admit what''s good in a man.""

Taking a similar view, state Revenue Minister Kaushik Patel recalled how impartial Lyngdoh was, though careful enough not to take the CEC''s name.

""All good men should be awarded. One should remember the Digvijay Singh government in Madhya Pradesh was indicted for its failure to impartially revise the electoral rolls,"" the senior minister underlined.

BJP MLA Sunil Oza insisted, ""We should be grateful to Lyngdoh for conducting impartial polls. We won 127 seats in the state Assembly. Why should one be afraid of admitting what''s a fact?""

But he added, ""It''s because the BJP cooperated fully with Lyngdoh that the polls were held peacefully.""

The state''s powerful IAS bureaucracy has been mum on the issue, though Lyngdoh was a 1961 IAS batch officer. A spokesperson for the IAS Association said, ""We have still not held consultations.""

22,"Bathinda refinery: Punjab govt, HPCL lock horns","CHANDIGARH: In what appears to be a major stumbling block in the Bathinda refinery project, the Punjab government has held in abeyance the signing of a deed of assurance with Hindustan Petroleum Company Limited.

The HPCL, which has invested about Rs 300 crore in the project so far, had requested the state government a few weeks ago to sign an assurance deed in order to facilitate it to procure bank loans for the Rs 16,000-project.

The reluctance of the state government in signing the deed is in line with the public stance of chief minister Amarinder Singh, expressing strong reservations about the MOU clause that grants sales tax exemption to HPCL for 15 years.

In spite of union petroleum minister Ram Naik''s assurance to the state, that the refinery would be completed despite disinvestment in HPCL, the chief minister had expressed his reservations about the project and had indicated that a fresh memorandum of understanding needed to be signed.

The assurance deed envisages that the state government would adhere to the commitments made with regard to various concessions granted to the project under the memorandum of understanding signed between the two.Significantly, the state government has withheld consent for the deed even after issuing an official notification earlier on the concessions listed under the MOU.

Under the MOU, signed in November 2001 by the then Badal government, it was agreed, besides other things, that the state government would grant complete sales tax exemption to the refinery for 15 years, would exempt it of electricity duty and would share 50 per cent cost of construction to roads linking the highways.

The MOU had also laid down that the Punjab State Industrial Development Corporation would contribute an equity share in the project and act as a facilitator in it.

Sources in HPCL said it would be completely unfeasible to go ahead with the project if the state government decided to go back on its decision to grant ST exemption to it.

In its first phase, the project is scheduled to produce six million tonnes of oil annually, with its capacity being raised to nine million tonnes in the second phase.

Besides helping in the growth of ancillary units in the region, the project was expected to generate large scale employment avenues for the state.

At present, the state is earning about Rs 600 crore in ST revenue by way of oil stocks coming from outside the state.

24,The political importance of Ramchandra Paramhans,"NEW DELHI: Mahant Ramchandra Paramhans, the chairman of the Ramjanmbhoomi Nyas, and the head of the powerful Digambar Akhada in Ayodhya, was closely associated with the Ram Temple movement since December 22, 1949, when he was apparently ""witness"" to the ""mysterious appearance"" of an idol of the child Ram inside the Babri Masjid.

But it is only from the late 1980s, when the Ramjanmabhoomi movement gathered momentum, and a political dimension, that Paramhans became a familiar name to the nation indeed, even international audiences.

With his death on Thursday morning, the BJP which rode to power on the wave of the Ramjanmabhoomi movement has lost a key link in the chain of people who it hoped would help resolve the Ayodhya issue in its favour, party sources admit.

A senior party functionary, closely acquainted with Paramhans over the years, told Times News Network that even in the last weeks of his life, Parmahans had been working on yet another formula.

This formula, sources said, was to persuade the main plaintiff in the fifth title suit, Mohammad Hashim Ansari, who represented the Sunni Waqf Board, to withdraw from the case in exchange for the withdrawal of the three other pending title suits filed by Gopal Singh Visharad, the Nirmohi Akhada and the VHP.

Paramhans, who had filed a fifth suit in 1950, had withdrawn it in 1990. After the legal cases were withdrawn, the next step would have been negotiations between the two communities, a situation in which the Hindu side expected to have leverage, sources said, as Paramhans had also promised to ""persuade'' the RSS/VHP to give up its claims to Kashi and Mathura.

Whether Paramhans would have succeeded in persuading Ansari will never be known now, but the two men did enjoy a personal equation. On Thursday, Ansari saying he would attend the funeral, stressed that Parmhans'' death was a personal loss to him, and credited him with preventing communal tension on many occasions in this temple town. BJP general secretary Mukthar Abbas Naqvi added, ""Even when the Ram movement unleashed violence elsewhere, Ayodhya remained peaceful, thanks to Paramhans'' personal efforts. In the movement, he was a ''moderate'', someone who had the capacity to get on with a variety of people.""

Indeed, Paramhans'' significance to the BJP leadership and the Sangh Parivar can be gauged from the fact that everyone from the Prime Minister, Deputy PM LK Advani, HRD Minister Murli Manohar Joshi, RSS chief K Sudarshan, senior RSS functionaries Mohan Bhagwat and Madan Das Devi to VHP chief Ashok Singhal will be there on the banks of the Saryu on Friday to pay their last respects.

At times, Parmahans had lambasted top BJP leaders, reminding them that their primary commitment should be to the movement that had brought them to power. Most recently, he had expressed his anger against Advani, when the Shankaracharya of Kanchipuram, rather than the VHP, had been roped in, and Singhal accused the government of ""deeply'' hurting Paramhans'' feelings. But, thereafter, Paramhans was again deployed, as BJP sources claim.

A key issue now will be: Who will succeed Paramhans as chairman of the Ramjanmbahoomi Nyas, the cash-rich trust which is to build the temple? For, BJP sources say, in the ultimate analysis, the 90-year-old Paramhans was pragmatic and, despite his often strong rhetoric, understood the compulsions of the Vajpayee government.

25,JD-S activists on rampage to 'protest' lawlessness,"PATNA: The members of Janata Dal (Secular) went on rampage while protesting the deteriorating law and order situation in the state, here on Thursday. The party activists damaged several cars including some government vehicles at the Dak Bungalow roundabout during the ""civil curfew"".

The party workers, who had assembled to protest the increasing cases of kidnapping, murder and deteriorating law and order in Bihar, created panic among the commuters at the Dak Bungalow roundabout for about one hour.

A passer-by sarcastically remarked that ""these people have assembled here to protest rising crime graph by means of vandalism.""

Partyâ€™s state president Jaynendra Kumar alleged that the chief ministerâ€™s residence has become the nodal centre of crime in the state. ""No crime in the state takes place without the knowledge of the CM and RJD supremo Laloo Prasad Yadav,"" he said.

Kumar said that the party is going to form a shadow government at the Raj Bhavan on August 12.

The situation was brought under control only after the Kotwali police arrested seven of the party activists. However, they were later released on bail.

26,Doctors arrested after patient dies,"NEW DELHI: Three doctors have been arrested by the southwest district police in a case where a man reportedly died after he reacted adversely to anaesthesia administered to him in September last. The police have accused the doctors of negligence.

Two of the accused are owners of private hospitals, while the third is a surgeon. They include owner of Bhagat nursing home, Monika Bhagat, owner of Kukereja hospital, Rajneesh Kukreja, and the Dinkar Chawla, a surgeon at Bhagat nursing home who was allegedly responsible for recommending surgery.

The three doctors were, however, put behind bars after their arrest on Wednesday.

The case dates back to September 2002 when Vikramjeet (18) approached Bhagat nursing home in Safdurjung enclave for treatment. He was suffering from pilonidol sinus, for which doctors recommended a minor surgery. The problem began when Vikramjeet developed complications after anaesthesia.

According to the police, the absence of a ventilator caused further deterioration in Vikramjeetâ€™s condition, and the nursing home decided to shift him to another hospital.

â€˜â€˜It was an emergency case, but doctors at Bhagat chose to shift him to Kukreja hospital, when AIIMS was hardly a kilometre away,â€™â€™ said a senior police official.

The main allegation being made against Bhagat is that the nursing home is not a registered one. But defence counsel for the hospital, Ashish Bhagat, contests this allegation. He claimed that the nursing home has a valid registration.

Kukreja has been accused of not providing a ventilator to the patient.

The advocate, however, claimed that a ventilator is not required in such a minor surgery. But then a police officer said that if there was no need, why did Kukreja nursing home put him on a ventilator an hour later.

The advocate further defended his client stating that the police did not conduct autopsy on the victimâ€™s body.
