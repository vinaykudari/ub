0,Nicotine-resistant gloves for tobacco farm workers,"AHMEDABAD: Tobacco is harmful not only for its consumers but also for about six million farmers who work in tobacco farms across the countryâ€” the second largest producer in the world.

To find out ways to prevent â€˜green sign symptomsâ€™ from affecting farmers who are exposed to nicotine while working with their bare hands during harvesting, the ministry of health and family welfare had assigned a project to the National Institute of Occupational Health (NIOH).

The NIOH deputy director in charge of geno toxicity and microbiology, Dr Vasu Gokani, and Dr Jagdish Parikh, deputy director senior grade in charge of occupation and respiratory medicine, worked on the project.

""Workers suffered from severe toxic effects due to their contact with the tobacco plant. The nicotine entered the body through skin contact. They used their bare palms and arms and suffered routinely from symptoms of nausea, vomiting, headache, fatigue and giddiness. The nicotine entered their system and medical examination of urine samples showed its presence in the body,"" said Dr Parikh.

According to Dr Gokani, in western countries workers used gloves made of â€˜Nitrile,â€™ a chemical resistant that could ward off the effect. ""But these are expensive and not suitable for the Indian condition. In India, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka are the three major states where tobacco production is high.""

""We decided to interview farmers in Anand with help of the Tribhovandas Foundation and in AP we sought help from the Central Tobacco Research Institute (CTRI) to devise an efficient and economical way to ward off the green sign symptoms"", she said.

""Workers complained that not only were they affected the symptoms, but also faced the problem of having their arms and palms smeared with tar from the plant sap which needed rigorous washing and caused abrasions and skin peels around the nails. Additionally they complained that the food they ate tasted bitter due to the nicotinelaced hands"", says Dr Parikh.

This led the NIOH team decide to opt for gloves that would be worker-friendly. ""We first experimented with rubber gloves, but these were rejected by workers as they were not user-friendly.We then tried cotton gloves, cotton and polyester gloves and nylon gloves.""

1,"No IT for farmer, assures Ajit Singh","KAKWAN: Union agriculture minister and national president of the Rashtriya Lok Dal Chaudhari Ajit Singh gave assurances to farmers that he would not allow imposition of income tax on farmers whether he remained in government or not. He said that India could not boast of an excess of food grains. However, he added that there was a shortage of space to store this food grain in the country.

Addressing a public meeting, The ''Kisan swabhiman rally'' at Kakwan village, about 70 kms from Kanpur city, the Union minister opposed the move to bring the farmers under the income tax net and said that ""the Union finance ministry is planning to impose tax on farmers... I have urged the government not to implement such a scheme because it will affect the poor farmers of the country"". Taking a note of his plea, the Union government had withdrawn its move, he added.

Critising political parties for overlooking the problems of farmers on ground, Singh said that political parties were raising worthless issues as mandir and masjid but didn''t pay any heed to problems of farmers. None of the political parties had made serious efforts to redress the grievances of farmers. As a result, farmers had failed to get due position in society since independence, he said.

Accusing the government about its assurance to wipe off the debt of farmers, he said that the government had assured the farmers not to realise debt to the tune of Rs 10,000 crore but it had taken no initiative in this connection so far.

On the other hand, the Union government had allocated Rs 13,000 for the survival of the Unit Trust of India. He said that the government should also set up an institutions which would provide loans to farmers on less rates of interest.

About record production of food grains in the country, he said, ""earlier, the country was facing problems due to low production of foods grains but now things have changed... We are producing record agro-products but have failed to suitably store and market them."" He stressed on the need for proper storage and marketing of food grains.

2,INTUC not to participate in April 21 bandh,"MUMBAI: Stating that bandhs were not a solution to the unemployment problem plaguing the nation, the Indian National Trade Union Congress (INTUC) has decided not to participate in the nation-wide industry bandh called by left parties on April 21.

""Already industry is facing problems due to recession and such type of bandhs only add to the woes,"" INTUC president G Sanjeeva Reddy said while addressing a two-day executive of the union that concluded here on Sunday.

The problems faced by industrial workers can be solved by having a dialogue with government and pressurising them to withdraw policies detrimental to workers interests, he said.

Deputy Chief Minister Chhagan Bhujbal while speaking on the occasion, warned labour unions not to fall prey to bandhs, called by political parties to gain political mileage and asked them to care for the interests of workers instead.

3,5 Fernandes supporters expelled from Samata party,"PATNA: The Samata Party feud between the supporters of defence minister George Fernandes and those of railway minister Nitish Kumar on Sunday led to the expulsion of five Fernandes loyalists.

The expelled party men were MPs Raghunath Jha and Brahmanand Mandal and legislators P K Sinha, Bhai Birendra and Ganesh Paswan. Another Fernandes supporter, Umashankar Singh, was removed from the post of leader of the partyâ€™s legislative wing in Bihar.

Decisions to this effect were taken at a meeting convened here by Kumar loyalist and former MP Bashishth Narayan Singh. While Kumar himself preferred to stay in Jharkhand, Fernandes supporters boycotted the meeting, calling it illegal.

The feud between Kumar and Fernandes has been going on since Fernandes as party president wrote a letter to the Election Commission, informing it that the Bihar executive committee of the party had not been dissolved. Kumar loyalists assailed Fernandesâ€™s move as it meant continuance of Kumar-baiters at the helm of affairs in the partyâ€™s state unit. Kumar loyalists had earlier replaced Umashankar and Sinha as leaders of the party in the assembly and the council with their own men â€” Upendra Prasad Kushwaha and Mangani Lal Mandal respectively.

Releasing copies of the resolutions to mediapersons just after the meetings of the partyâ€™s state executive, state legislature party and state council on Sunday, Bashishth said the state executive has sent its â€œadopted resolutionsâ€� to the central leadership with its â€œrecommendationsâ€�. It has demanded that the decisions be approved immediately. If the central leadership fails to approve the â€œrecommendationsâ€�, the state unit â€œwill be free to take proper decisions in the matter in the interest of the party,â€� he added. Kushwaha was also present at the press conference.

But Bashishth did not elaborate what would be the â€œproper decisionsâ€�. Kushwaha said the censure motion passed on April 5 against Fernandes still stands.

He said a majority of the party men had been requesting him to convene the meetings. Asked whether the majority rule or the party constitution prevails in the Samata Party, he and Kushwaha replied, â€œBoth.â€�

Kushwaha said the censure motion passed on April 5 against Fernandes still stands.

4,Mamata seeks President's rule in the state,"KOLKATA: The Trinamul Congress seems to be facing the same predicament which the state Congress had faced in the 1980s. On Sunday, Trinamul leaders said the Centre should impose President''s Rule in the state as Opposition candidates were unable to file nomination for panchayat elections because of CPM threats.

Though the BJP is a partner of the Trinamul in the NDA and its alliance partner for the panchayat polls in West Bengal, senior state BJP leaders indicated that they did not favour President''s Rule.

In the 1980s, Pradesh Congress leaders used to cry hoarse against the ""misrule"" of the CPM, but chief minister Jyoti Basu enjoyed rapport with the Congress government at the Centre, mainly because of national political compulsions of keeping the BJP out.

In fact, it was one of the reasons why leaders like Mamata Banerjee had left the Congress to launch the Trinamul Congress, alleging that the Congress had become the ""CPM''s B-team"".

""It is a constitutional right of every citizen to contest elections and choose the candidates they like. Since the Opposition parties are not able to field candidates, their constitutional rights are not being protected. The Centre should therefore intervene and impose President''s Rule,"" Trinamul leader Pankaj Banerjee said.

A senior BJP leader felt, however, that the demand for President''s Rule would not yield any result, as it would be shot down by the Congress in the Rajya Sabha. That Union home minister L.K. Advani had recently praised chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee''s handling of the situation at the Bangladesh border was also known.

BJP state president Tathagata Roy said though, that the CM was overplaying the threat of the People''s War and the Kamtapur Liberation Organisation to get more Central funds and arms, and instead arresting BJP and Trinamul workers, branding them as PW and KLO activists.

Roy suggested that the panchayat polls scheduled on May 11 be deferred in the seats where the Opposition could not file nomination. Banerjee rejected this, stating that it was not ""legally tenable"". Now that the election had been notified, it could not be postponed, he argued.

He did not give much importance to Saturday''s statement by the CM acknowledging that Opposition parties had not been able to file nominations in many seats. ""We have been complaining about this from day one, but the chief minister has made his statement when only one working day is left for filing nominations,"" he said.

Besides, even after the CM''s statement, threats against Opposition candidates were continuing in many districts of south Bengal, he said.

6,Kerala Cong tussle over RS polls,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: A political crisis seems to be developing in the United Democratic Front (UDF) government in Kerala.

Karunakaran has fielded rebel candidate Kodot Govindan Nair for one of the two Rajya Sabha seats against the official candidates - Vayalar Ravi and Thennala Balakrishna Pillai - to spite the high command for refusing him a ""proper"" place.

His group received a shot in the arm 12 hours before the election when the opposition Left Front (LDF) announced that its surplus votes would be transferred to those fighting against the Antony government.

The message is clear - not only the LDF''s four surplus votes would go to the Karunakaran nominee, but also the 40 Opposition MLAs'' second preference votes would go to Nair. If this happens, one of the two official candidates would be defeated.

The Karunakaran camp on Sunday threw a direct challenge at the party high command with a vow to work for the victory of Nair. There were 26 of the 62 Congress MLAs at a solidarity meeting held at his residence.

7,"Right to privacy is not absolute, rules SC","NEW DELHI: After getting married, right to privacy comes to an end. This is official and also legal as the Supreme Court has put its stamp on an issue which may be very close to one''s heart and dear to his or her life.

When the going is smooth, right to privacy may not crop up at all, but when the driving becomes bumpy it may take the front seat. In all matrimonial disputes, the issue may not be involved and need not be gone into. But, imagine if divorce is sought on the ground of unbearable mental illness or impotency, the courts would have no option but to seek medical experts opinion to do the complete justice.

Of course, refusal to offer oneself for such a medical examination to ascertain the truth would not help as that would draw an adverse inference meaning thereby the allegation made by a spouse is correct.

Now, the constitutional right under Article 21 of the Constitution (right to life with dignity) which also guarantees right to privacy come into play.

Could a spouse faced with the allegation of impotency or of not sound mental health invoke the constitutional provision to negate a trial court''s order asking him or her to offer for a medical examination? Answer is in the negative.

In a important judgment on an issue which is not commonly raised in the matrimonial disputes, a Bench of Chief justice V N Khare, Justices S B Sinha and A R Lakshmanan said: ""... there is no right privacy specifically conferred under Article 21 of the Constitution and with the extensive interpretation of the phrase`personal liberty'' this right has been read into Article 21, it cannot be treated as absolute right"".

Thus, an order passed by the court in this context could not be construed as an infringement of the fundamental right.

Since the courts have been entrusted with very delicate power to enter into the domain of one''s privacy, it is pertinent that the power is exercised sparingly and while keeping in mind dignity and sensitivity of the person on whom it is to be applied.

Thus, an enquiry can''t be roving. The court must have sufficient and cogent material before it prior to ordering a spouse to subject himself or herself for a medical examination to determine the truth.

""Exercise of such discretion would be subjected to the supervisory jurisdiction of the high court"", the Bench has explained. Abuse of the discretionary power at the hands of court is not expected,"" the apex court has hoped, notwithstanding of the fact that discretionary powers vested in any authority are invariably misused.

Right to privacy is not the only freedom which is not absolute. Right to free movement, speech and expression are some other cherished privileges that a free citizen feels he is constitutionally entitled to, but all these civic rights can be curtailed at the whims and fancies of are the executive.

8,Togadia arrested after defying ban,"AJMER: VHP leader Praveen Togadia was on Sunday night arrested shortly after he distributed tridents to Bajrang Dal activists here defying ban and prohibitory orders. Togadia distributed the tridents among a gathering of 3,000 Dal activists amid chanting of hymns and slogans at the Subhash Udyan. But within hours, police arrested the VHP leader near Kishangunj, about 40 km from here, as he headed towards Jaipur after the tridents distribution function (Trishul Deeksha) at Subhash Udyan in this holy town, a senior police official said in Jaipur. Togadia was arrested under the Arms Act, the official said. The Rajasthan government had on April 8 banned distribution, possession and carrying of tridents in the state except at religious places. Earlier, Togadia was briefly stopped by police from entering Ajmer as he was going to attend the 'Dharamsabha' and 'Trishul Diksha' in a convoy of 10 vehicles, Inspector General of Police (Law and Order) A K Jain said. The VHP leader's convoy was returning from Nasirabad via Palra where he addressed trainees at a camp when it was stopped, Jain said. After heated arguments with the police, Togadia and 50 supporters walked from Makhupura towards the city but they were again stopped near Martin bridge, 5 km from the venue of the function. Authorities tried to persuade Togadia to call off his journey to the venue of 'Trishul Diksha' but to no avail. Togadia was then taken alone to the Dharmsabha venue in a bullet proof vehicle, the IG said. Two companies of the Rajasthan Armed Constabulary and three units of the Rapid Action Force were deployed around the venue and in the city.

10,PM to address public rally in Srinagar,"NEW DELHI: Atal Bihari Vajpayee will be the first Prime Minister to address a public rally in Srinagar since the advent of militancy in 1989 when he begins his two-day visit to Jammu and Kashmir on Friday.

State government sources said the Prime Minister would be addressing a rally at Sher-e-Kashmir grounds and all security measures have been completed for the same.

Vajpayee would be sharing the dais with state Chief Minister Mufti Mohammed Sayeed, much to the displeasure of its NDA coalition partner National Conference.

Already some rumblings appear to have started within the National Conference over the decision of Vajpayee to share the stage with a Congress-backed coalition in the state.

The Prime Minister is also scheduled to address a public rally at Qazigund where he would be reviewing work on prestigious National Highway Development project.

Vajpayee''s public meetings come 15 years after the then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi had addressed a public meeting in the Kashmir Valley in 1987.

11,VHP calls for Rajasthan bandh on Tuesday,"JAIPUR: The VHP on Monday gave a call for Rajasthan bandh on Tuesday to protest the arrest of its international general secretary Praveen Togadia after a trident distribution ceremony in Ajmer.

In a statement, state unit president Jagannath Gupta demanded release of Togadia and withdrawal of all cases filed against him under the Arms Act and various sections of IPC.

Terming the ban on distribution of tridents as a step to appease Muslims and hurt Hindus, he warned that the VHP would not tolerate ""Tughlaki ruling"" of the Gehlot government.

State unit of BJP announced its support to the bandh. Its spokesman Kali Charan Saraf appealed to the business community to observe a shutdown on Tuesday to protest the ban on trishul, a symbol of Lord Shiva and sanctity of Hindus.

Meanwhile, prohibitory orders were clamped on Monday in entire Ajmer district and policemen in strength were being deployed in all sensitive cities of the state in view of the bandh, a senior official said.

12,"Sangh Parivar, BJP flay Togadia's arrest","NEW DELHI: Enraged by the arrest of its firebrand leader Praveen Togadia, the VHP on Monday declared it would actively work against the Congress in the coming Rajasthan Assembly polls even as the BJP said that the state government would have to ""bear the consequences"" for the ban on tridents and the Sangh Parivar leader''s incarceration.

""We had stated earlier that we would campaign only if any Hindutva issue is at stake. By banning Trishul and arresting Togadia, the state government has forced us to campaign against it,"" VHP senior vice-president Acharya Giriraj Kishore said on phone from Ajmer.

Kishore, who met Togadia at the Ajmer jail, said carrying ''Trishul'' was the religious and fundamental right of Hindus.

Asked whether VHP would move the court against the government order, he said, ""we are going to the people''s court beginning with the state Bandh on Tuesday.""

He, however, said that the VHP''s campaign would be against the Gehlot regime and not in support of BJP or any other party. Essential services and schools would be exempted from the Bandh on Tuesday, the VHP leader said.

Meanwhile, BJP national treasurer and state party in-charge Ramdas Aggarwal condemned the notification banning tridents and said, ""it is aimed at appeasing one community and harassing the other. By arresting Togadia and others, the government is unnecessarily creating tension in the state.""

""The state government would be fully responsible for any communal disharmony and they have to bear the consequences for banning Trishul and carrying out the arrests,"" he said on phone from Jaipur, and added the party supported VHP''s Bandh call but would not participate in it.

RSS, too, condemned the ban and Togadia''s arrest describing it as ""pure political vendetta to appease certain sections of the society."" Sangh spokesman Ram Madhav said RSS supported the VHP''s bandh call.

13,Power: Now it's all about politics,"NEW DELHI: All those who thought that privatisation would mean fewer power-cuts in the city are in for a major disappointment. There will be no harsh measures against power thieves as the Sheila Dikshit government does not want to risk its popularity in an election year.

Senior Congress leaders are convinced that raids against power thefts will be a huge gain for the BJP. â€˜â€˜The rich steal more power than those living in slums. But the number of slum-dwellers is quite large and they also mean a big votebank. We cannot afford to displease both these segments before the assembly elections in November,â€™â€™ said a Delhi minister.

Officials of the private distribution companies refused to guarantee any drastic change in the power situation this summer. â€˜â€˜We donâ€™t have a magical wand. We are aware that it is just a matter of a few weeks before all political parties start attacking us for not doing enough to tackle the summer power crisis,â€™â€™ said a BSES official.

The power scenario in the city seems grim. Power consumption in the city is likely to peak to 3,700 MW a day this summer. But the peak power supply may hover around 3,300 MW a day, despite the Delhi governmentâ€™s claim to have tied up with other states for procuring 4,000 MW of power.

About 50 per cent of the total power available does not reach the consumer. It goes unaccounted due to thefts and faults.

â€˜â€˜A consumer, who pays his bills and draws only that much power he is authorised to, will continue to suffer power cuts while influential power thieves, including politically-linked industrialists, may continue to enjoy special treatment,â€™â€™ said a Tata Power official.

14,"Man kills his 4 children, runs away to commit suicide","GHAZIABAD: A man poisoned his four children, on Sunday night, after a fight with his wife. Salim (33) then disappeared from his Shahid Nagar residence, leaving a note saying he was going to kill himself too.

Nargisâ€™ brother Gulsher, a steel fabricator, said she called him on Sunday afternoon and asked him to take her away as Salim had beaten her. The children stayed behind.

At about 11.30 am on Monday, Nargisâ€™s sister, Samana, came to check on the children and found them dead in their beds. The police was called and the bodies were removed for autopsies. They said Salim had probably mixed poison with tea and served it to his children.

Salim and Nargis had been married for 10 years. They had four children Rukhsar (7), Reshma (5), Samir (3) and Wasim (1).

â€˜â€˜But, there was discord between the couple from the beginning. Two years ago, Salim had set himself on fire and Nargis also sustained serious burns while trying to save him.â€™â€™

The police said Salim was not traceable. They said he left a note saying, â€˜â€˜I cannot take the fighting anymore. And, Nargis often goes away, leaving the children. I will kill myself where she can never find my body.â€™â€™

15,Prince faces charges of cheque bounce,"NEW DELHI: A Delhi court has issued a non-bailable warrant against Sangram Singh Gaekwad, scion of the Baroda royal family and his son, Pratap Singh Gaekwad in a cheque bouncing case.

The warrants were issued after the father and son failed to appear before a city court. The two are wanted in five cases of cheque bouncing which are more than two years old. Gaekwad and his son are accused of issuing cheques worth Rs 43 lakh to a Delhi based company even though there were â€˜â€˜insufficient fundsâ€™â€™ in their bank account.

Metropolitan magistrate J P Narain also issued the warrants against K K Gaur, deputy general manager (purchase) of Gaekwadâ€™s company, M/s Baroda Rayon Corporation Limited, a Mumbai-based company. Gaur, Sangram Singh Gaekwad and Pratap Singh Gaekwad have to appear before the court on July 7.

The complainant, Asif Garg said he used to supply coal to Gaekwadâ€™s company. Garg heads a company, M/s Hindon Carrying Corporation Prviate Limited, in Preet Vihar.

While appearing for Garg, advocate D K Gupta contended that the cheques were for money which Gaekwadâ€™s company owned to his client. â€˜â€˜We served them legal notices. But when they failed to respond, we got the case registered,â€™â€™ Gupta said.

According to him, the accused have to appear before the court on every date of hearing or file an application for exemption. But on March 9, only two of the accused filed an application. The court has exempted the co-accused, Sangram Singhâ€™s wife Asaraje Gaekwad, and one of the companyâ€™s directors, J P Singh on medical grounds.

16,Varsity teachers protest increase in work hours,"NEW DELHI: A section of the teaching fraternity has come down heavily on Delhi Universityâ€™s (DU) move to â€˜â€˜increase working hoursâ€™â€™ for teachers. They say this a move to implement the University Grants Commission (UGC) directive on 22 hours of teaching in a week.

DU authorities, however, said these fears were misplaced and that the decisions were a result of demands by teachers over a period of time. At present, teachers in most DU colleges teach for 16.5 hours a week on an average.

The Academic Council (AC) in a recent meeting adopted the recommendations of the Tandon Committee on Academic Reforms and Accountability. Among other things, teachers have taken exception to the recommendation for introducing a system of notifying three hours per week where teachers will be available to students for consultation.

â€˜â€˜This is simply an attempt to please the UGC. We donâ€™t have anything against staying for an extra three hours every week, but there is no need to mention this on the timetable. In due course, the contact hours will be converted to teaching hours,â€™â€™ said Academics for Action and Development (AAD) chairman S S Rathi. He said the matter would be brought up in the executive council meet as well.

According to him, the UGC recommendation for a 22-hour teaching week was struck down by the Delhi University Teachersâ€™ Association (DUTA) as it was aimed at proving that DU had surplus teaching staff.

AC member Gurmohinder Singh also raked up the issue of infrastructure. â€˜â€˜The AC has resolved to introduce tutorials. We are not against the move, but a lot of colleges do not have enough classrooms for holding tutorials,â€™â€™ he said.

DUTA president Shaswati Majumdar said she did not have a problem with the recommendations apart from the quantification of contact hours.

17,Disinvestment Commitee to approve rebidding for Shipping Corporation,"NEW DELHI: With no foreign suitors in sight for the soon-to-be-divested Shipping Corporation of India, the Cabinet Committee on Disinvestment will meet Tuesday to decide if the 26 per cent cap on the holding by foreign companies in bidding consortiums should be relaxed.

In addition, Air India and Indian Airlines will be taken off the privatisation list, at least for a year. The meeting is also expected to take up the disinvestment of a host of PSUs and hotels of the Indian Tourism Development Corporation. It would also firm up guidelines for employees making bids for PSUs.

According to sources, SCI would occupy a major part of the CCD''s deliberations. In all probability, the committee would approve ""rebidding"" in the shipping major. So far, four bidders -- Videocon, BPL, Essar and Sterlite -- are in the fray for SCI. Only Essar has a tie up with American Marine Associates. Officials say that the 26 per cent cap on foreign companies is ""a major handicap"" which was acknowledged by the core group of secretaries on disinvestment while suggesting rebidding in SCI.

Disinvestment officials are upbeat with the shipping ministry''s response which had sought a year''s time to change the foreign direct investment rules in shipping. However, it is felt that if the CCD gives a go ahead for change in rules, 51 per cent of SCI along with management control could change hands very soon. The government would be left with 25 per cent while the rest would go to employees.

The CCD would also decide on the disinvestment of Hooghly Printing Company, Hindustan Newsprint Ltd, Tide Water Oil Ltd, Rashtriya Chemicals & Fertilisers, Hindustan Cable Ltd, National Building Construction Corporation Ltd and ITDC hotels in Patna, Bhubaneshwar, Jammu and Jaipur.

Despite a big lineup for Tuesday''s CCD, officials now admit that the process of disinvestment has slowed down to a large extent. ""Despite severe setbacks last year, we were enthusiastic but now it seems there is a general feeling not to hardsell privatisation,"" says a senior disinvestment ministry official. He feels the delay in SCI''s disinvestment is difficult to understand. For months, he says, the government has been aware of the reasons behind the poor response. ""It could have been easily rectified,"" he says. According to him, if big ticket PSUs are a problem, smaller PSUs and ITDC hotels could have been easily disinvested in the past three months.
