0,Mamata wants White Paper on bandh,"kolkata: trinamul congress chairperson mamata banerjee said that the west bengal government should bring out a white paper on bangla bandhs. speaking to newsmen in kolkata on wednesday, banerjee said that it was the cpm that was instrumental in organising most of bandhs in the state. the trinamul also reiterated its moral support to thursday's bandh called by the socialist unity centre of india (suci) and some left political parties. senior trinamul leader and kolkata mayor subrata mukherjee said: we are not bothered whether anybody wants our support or not. mukherjee said that recent state government decision to arrest people blockading roads and railway tracks amounted to curbing people's right to protest. it happens only under military rule or under emergency, the mayor said. mamata banerjee pointed out that as a responsible opposition party, trinamul could not keep away from reflecting public opinion. the hike in electricity tariff, fee hike in colleges and lack of support price for paddy for west bengal farmers were matters of concern. by effecting these hikes, the state government led by chief minister buddhadeb bhattacharjee was merely protecting the interests of petty industrialists and realtors, banerjee said. a conspiracy has been hatched by these people to finish off trinamul congress but it will not succeed, banerjee said. the trinamul chairman also said that though her party cadres would not actively enforce the bandh, they would surely intervene if anybody wanted to foil the strike through use of force. special measures at airport for thursday's bandh: to ensure smooth functioning of work at the nsc bose airport here during the 24 hour bandh called by suci on thursday, the state police is setting up pickets near it and would keep a watch on the movement around it. special police forces would be deployed in an around the airport and all roads leading to it would be guarded from about half a mile by special pickets which would be set up at different road points, official sources said. no one would be allowed to stage demonstration or resort to picketing in and around the airport, the sources added.

1,Hand-tool exporters unhappy with govt: Study,"ludhiana: the hand-tool exporters of jalandhar and ludhiana are not satisfied with the government's export policy and the incentives provided to boost exports. these are the findings of the study of 'problems and procedures in exports: a case study of handtool exporters of ludhiana and jalandhar', conducted by yadvinder singh dhiman, a student of punjab college of technical education, here. the exporters are also unhappy with the custom authorities, who they say, delay the dispatch of their consignments without reason. besides this, the exporters went on to add that the export promotion councils (epcs) have failed. the sample population comprised 40 exporters from ludhiana and jalandhar. college director kns kang said that the government needs to ensure that the share of india in the global market increases, since at present it was abysmally low. more than 65 per cent of the companies were operating exclusively the foreign market. according to the study, high interest rates and inadequate incentives are the major problems being faced by the hand tool exporters. this makes indian goods expensive. many exporters felt that the documentation process was time consuming and needed to be simplified. though, they added, that the implementation of the aligned documentation system (ads), had helped to some extent. the exporters say that the facilities at the ludhiana dry port were inadequate.they say that the port officials waste time, causing delay, and were irresponsible. the main reason for decline in the growth of handtool exports was found to be exporters' lack of knowledge about the market. these exporters, 75 per cent of them, get orders placed through agents, by sending samples abroad and participating in trade fairs. the commission being paid to agents varies between three per cent to ten per cent. the exporters are apparently unable to handle fluctuations in the foreign exchange market. many of them are for the spot rate method and only big players go for forward contracts.

2,State lures investors to farm sector,"mumbai: so what does one do in times of financial drought, with it promises coming a cropper? turn to real crop and show investors how to reap a sunny harvest, if maharashtra's new policy tilt towards the agricultural sector is any indication.aiming greater participation from private players, the state government is working at a model plan which blends social cause with economics. from providing credit facilities to farmers to leasing farm equipment, from counselling on soil, seeds and related matters to processing of farm produce, a number of services could suddenly become easily available and affordable with corporate participation.farmers from vidarbha, marathwada, konkan and western maharashtra may soon be signing agreement papers with firms dealing in agro-inputs, insurance companies, banks, storage houses and food-processing companies. the joint venture of this kind will be aimed at bringing assistance at the farmer's doorstep, say mantralaya officials.a task force of state officials and top corporates is already ploughing on the project. ``privately-run farmer service centres will be set up in villages involving corporate specialists to advise farmers on precision farming techniques. the centres will also house banks and insurance company personnel to financially aid farmers. the processing companies will ensure that the produce is lifted from the field directly and stored, thus reducing costs,'' says an official.significantly, the idea is to do away with middlemen, who are often known to fleece cash-starved farmers desperate to sell off their yield, he says, adding that this would also reduce the market price of farm products.``as many as 65 per cent of the state population is dependent on agriculture and 57.6 per cent of the land in maharashtra is under agriculture. a planned growth in this sector is directly related to growth in the manufacturing sector and stands to boost gdp,'' says another mantralaya official.not surprisingly, chief minister vilasrao deshmukh, a farmer from the marathwada region, seems impressed by this concept, which is reportedly the brainchild of hindustan lever limited (hll) chairman m.s. banga.hll, in a joint venture with rallis and icici, has translated the idea into practice in hoshangabad district in central madhya pradesh. the corporates set up a farm service centre in 1999 on a 250-acre plot and helped wheat cultivators improve productivity.according to a senior hll official, the wheat production went up by 70 per cent and the quality of the grain could be improved because of expert advise.mr deshmukh, who was witness to the hll chief's presentation is said to have immediately extended him an invitation for a slide presentation to the state cabinet.accordingly, prominent businessmen involved in the food industry, including nadir godrej from godrej industries, mr banga and nasser monjee from idfc made a presentation to the cabinet ministers and top state officials.the government has decided to get into the act and has constituted a task force under the chairmanship of the state agriculture minister rohidas patil to prepare a road map for the state's agro-based economy.other members of the task force include mr banga, suketu shah, mr godrej, mr monjee, raju dubey, pallavi jha and secretaries of the departments of agriculture, cooperation and industry.

3,Expert warns against genetic modification,"mumbai: ``don't believe all that hype about the recently cloned piglets,'' cautions sue mayer, executive director of genewatch uk. a research fellow at sussex university and the university of lancaster, dr mayer is taking part in the ongoing indo-british science festival in the city.the piglets-born on christmas day and named noel, angel, star, joy and mary-are said to be bio-engineered in a way that would prevent the rejection of their organs when transplanted into humans. but dr mayer says no matter what the boffins tell you, the physiology of noel the piglet differs from that of its human counterpart, and the issue of immune rejection of xenografts is infernally more complex than it's being made out to be.``also remember that the insertion of foreign genes into an animal's genome is not simply a stage further in the path of selective breeding,'' she warns. ``no matter how skilled or diligent the breeder, cows do not cross with mice, or bacteria, or humans. genetic modification of animals represents a watershed in our relationship with the natural world, bringing the potential to mix genes from species in a way that could not happen otherwise. it represents a significant further step towards seeing animals purely as commodities, to be created for our convenience.''dr mayer, who is on the british government's agriculture and environmental biotechnology commission, adds that such a change-the `marriage' of a mouse with a mooing cow-demands that there should be a presumption against such modification unless there are compelling arguments to do so. with the exception of some medical uses, the use of gm animals in agriculture to produce drugs or as organ donors is yet to be justified, she says.but dr mayer also distances herself from more extreme opposition to biotechnology. in fact, she starts her interview by saying that she and others belonging to her public interest science policy research group are ``not opposed to the new genetic technologies per se''.``we believe these technologies have a great potential to transform our society, to cause harm as well as benefit,'' she told this newspaper after her public lecture on social and ethical issues in biotechnology research at the british council.``but it's when we're making those decisions about biotechnology, as a society we need to make sure that the public interest, the environment and animal welfare are all protected,'' she explains. ``we need to involve people-ordinary people, lay folk, consumers, however you may want to talk about them-in the decision-making process, and their views need to be considered seriously. involving citizens is an important part of ensuring that the social and ethical shaping of biotechnology has a democratic basis,'' she adds. but isn't `people's empowerment' something that everyone loves to talk about? ``it may sound utopian, but it's precisely by discounting those fears and concerns that many biotech and agri-biz companies have created nightmarish conditions for themselves,'' she retorts. ``consider the classic case of the drug giant pharmacia. the company is planning to spin off monsanto, its controversial bio-engineering subsidiary, in the second half of 2002.''(once an $8-billion company, monsanto was was the most profitable life sciences corporation on the planet, with enough money to hire senior members from the former clinton administration to smooth its way through washington.industry-watchers say monsanto thought its mastery of genetics would lead to new generations of crops, drugs, chemicals and industrial materials to suit the needs of the world's burgeoning population. but growing consumer resistance to gm foods, particularly in europe, has shattered monsanto's grand illusions. a year ago, monsanto publicly apologised for its arrogance.)dr mayer adds that the moral of the story is that ``biotech's exclusive focus on commercialisation is making it very difficult to address the social and environmental issues, many of which have negative economic impacts.``so a focus on wealth creation alone isn't necessarily good for a country or for science, nor for that matter, a corporation.''she is currently working on developing a decision-making tool called deliberative mapping for evaluating new technologies. this is examining alternatives for treating organ failure and seeks to integrate expert and citizen assessments within a transparent framework for more democratic and accountable decision- making.

8,SC upholds election of Kamalnath,"new delhi: upholding election of congress leader kamalnath from chindwara constituency in madhya pradesh, the supreme court has ruled that to challenge the election of a successful candidate, a petition has to mention material facts on alleged corrupt practices. a bench comprising justice g.b. pattanaik and justice y.k. sabharwal in a recent judgement allowed an appeal by kamalnath challenging the madhya pradesh high court order to entertain an election petition against him. justice pattanaik, writing for the bench said that there was no averment in the election petition filed before the high court, which indicated that kamalnath had used a helicopter for a period and its expenses were beyond the permissible limit, thus bringing him within the purview of the provisions dealing with corrupt practices. ""it may be stated that mere non-disclosure of expenditure will not be a corrupt practice but incurring of expenditure in excess of the prescribed amount would be held to be a corrupt practice,"" the bench said. on a combined reading of section 77 and section 123(6) of the representation of peoples act, it was clear that excess expenditure must not be incurred by the candidate or by any person authorised by the candidate or his election agent, it said. ""it would, therefore, be necessary to establish a corrupt practice, as contemplated under section 123(6) of the act to plead requisite facts showing authorisation or undertaking of reimbursement by the candidate or his election agent,"" the bench said, adding such material were not mentioned by the person challenging kamalnath's election.

""there are no talks planned with air-india at this stage, though we are in constant touch with them as alliance partners... we are happy continuing our relationship,"" paul richard smitton, the airline's general manager (india), told reporters here. since july 2000, virgin has been flying twice a week direct between delhi and london compared with 19 of british airways and 10 of air-india. talks with air-india on starting the third flight have not made any progress yet. asked which other cities it would be looking forward to start its operations, smitton said that the virgin wanted to consolidate its position in delhi first and then look for other cities in the next 12 months. stating that the virgin flights from here were overbooked now, smitton said that the load factor was ""close to 100 per cent"" adding ""we plan to fly more frequently to delhi and other indian cities to match the growing demand"". while the load factor has initially dropped worldwide after the september 11 attacks, ""we maintained our flights from delhi though load factor of a number of airlines dropped and some of them stopped their services to india.""

10,IOC reviews investment in refinery expansion,"new delhi: the indian oil corporation (ioc) is likely to put on hold its rs 17,000 crore investment in paradip, panipat and koyali refineries in view of surplus refining capacity in the country and low margins. the company board would meet later this month to take a final view on setting up 9 million tonne grassroot refinery at paradip in orissa, doubling capacity at 6 million tonne panipat refinery in haryana and adding 4.3 million tonne capacity to the 13.7 million tonne refinery at koyali in gujarat, ioc chairman m.a. pathan said. asked if the corporation could drop the projects, he said ""we are not dropping any of the project... only the date of commissioning could be deferred."" shrinking of refinery margins due to small difference between crude oil prices and product prices, and declining petroleum product consumption in the country has forced ioc to make the difficult choice between the projects. while demand for petroleum product has remained near stagnant in 2000-01, it has fallen by a little less than 3 per cent during the current fiscal. diesel sales have been worse hit with sales dropping over 5 per cent in november 2001. ""the issue would be discussed at the ioc's board meeting later this month,"" pathan said, adding the board would review the projects while taking into account the future forecast of growth and accordingly consider respositioning of expansion plans.

11,"1,033 arrested in Bengal strike","kolkata: altogether 1,033 people, including 99 women, were on thursday arrested across west bengal for blocking rail and road traffic and preventing workers from joining duty during the opposition socialist unity centre of india (suci)-sponsored 24-hour bandh. state's igp (law and order) chayan mukherjee said the arrested included 916 suci and 117 cpi(ml-liberation) activists, a naxalite outfit, which supported the bandh. mukherjee said 169 of the arrested had been charged under railway and highway security act before their production in court. most of the arrests were made from coochbehar, jalpaiguri, bardhaman, murshidabad, hooghly and north 24 parganas districts, while police chased and dispersed the bandh supporters who squatted on rail tracks and tried to block road traffic to enforce bandh in many areas, he said, adding that some people were arrested for disconnecting hosepipe of a local train at habra station in north 24 parganas district. the bandh was called by suci in protest against the government's decision to hike hospital charges, power tariff, educational fees, and alleged 'anti-people policies' of both central and state governments. police patrols were visible in many parts of kolkata. on many traffic-free streets, children played cricket next to shops that were shut. ""the reaction to the strike is spontaneous. trains and buses are plying but are largely empty. the police are making random arrests,"" amitabha chatterjee, suci spokesman, said. an indian railways spokesman said that services of a few short distance suburban trains were affected by the strike, but added long distance services remained unaffected. in december, the government hiked hospital charges by over 30 per cent and also increased fees for government colleges. kolkata's private electricity provider cesc raised power tariffs by 2.5 per cent. though the suci has only two lawmakers in a state assembly of 294, it is well recognised for the street power of thousands of its cadres. the state's main opposition trinamool party has lent moral support to the strike. passengers at railways stations found it hard to find taxis and the few that were around were overcharging.

17,By-election to rob city of bhumi pujan,"vadodara: on january 26, 2002, elaborate 'bhumi-pujan' - to be performed in the state - will ""save all the cities and villages from natural disasters."" but not all. vadodara, where the model code of conduct has been clamped following declaration of the date of by-elections to the sayajigunj, will have to do without divine blessings. and, the people, shaken as it is after the devastation a year ago in kutch and ahmedabad, are cursing the politicians for their plight. scholars and godmen in the city too say that vadodara should have had its share of ""puja"" too. according to district collectorate officials, the state-wide ""puja"" planned by the state government cannot be held anywhere in the district as the by-election is slated for february 21. ""there were plans to tell the people who gather during the puja about the earthquake relief work done by the government. probably, it is because of this reason that the election commission has raised an objection. this puja will be held in most parts of the states,"" said the official. ""bhumi pujan is an auspicious act as it is believed that ""bhumi"" or earth has ""naudhan."" the puja will always bring good tidings for the people and the city,"" says mahashankar sharma, an astrologer who resides in vadkal on the banks of narmada and has a number of disciples here. people, however, plan to conduct their own puja, with housewives putting ""diya""s all along the foundation of their houses so that the structure remains safe. ""vadodara may have had a close shave last year. but, one cannot predict earthquakes. anyway, though the city was saved, one person had died in nearby padra taluka of the district,"" says a resident of raopura. ""our earth is active too. and, we need to appease it by performing puja. we have seen that many people in kutch, who were afraid to get back to their homes after the quake struck, did so when they performed bhumi-pujan,"" baroda sanskrit mahavidyalaya principal hm pandey. ""a professor from the netherlands, studying the effect of earthquake in kutch, has also written to the state government stressing on the need of the puja in the social context and in bringing about confidence in people,"" adds pandey. professor at ms university's sanskrit department labhshankar joshi too feels that a puja goes a long way in building the confidence of the people.
