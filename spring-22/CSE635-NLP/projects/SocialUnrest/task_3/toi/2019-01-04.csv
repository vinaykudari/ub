1,Poor turnout at all-party meet,"hyderabad: several major political parties failed to turn up at the all-party meeting convened by the district election authority on wednesday to discuss the implementation of the code of conduct for the ensuing mch election and to invite their suggestions over the shifting of polling stations. majlis bachao tehreek (mbt), mim, and congress were the only parties, which sent their representatives for the meeting, while the rest were reportedly busy finalising their candidates. mbt leader amjadullah khan khalid requested the election authority to shift some of the polling stations that were more than two kilometres away from the residential areas. similarly, he wanted the polling station at the deccan medical college premises to be shifted elsewhere since the college belonged to the leaders of a political party. mim mla asaduddin owaisi sought the shifting of polling station no 33, 34, 35 and 36 in jahnuma ward as they were far away. similarly, he wanted the polling booths no 25 and 26 at kishenbagh to be shifted to bahadurpura. asaduddin further wanted the election authority to review the list of 'sensitive polling stations' prepared by the police long back and remove some of them from the list.the situation today is different.the list should be prepared based on the experiences of the last assembly elections, and not on the incidents which took place in the 1980s, he said. representatives of mbt,mim,and congress requested the officials to remove the hoardings of chief minister n chandrababu naidu and prime minister atal behari vajpayee. city police commissioner p ramulu assured the political parties that the officials would act impartially and wanted the leaders to cooperate with police.he also wanted leaders of all political parties to provide the schedule of the campaign a day in advance to the police to ensure law and order. the commissioner said additional forces from the districts would be pressed into service. he also refused to extend the campaign till 11 pm, as sought by mim legislator syed sajjad. mch commissioner and designated election authority p k mohanty wanted all the parties to submit their complaints over shifting of polling stations by friday evening.

2,UP election scene hots up BJP pins hopes on temple,"new delhi: uttar pradesh elections without the ayodhya issue, as prime minister vajpayee exhorted all parties on thursday, seems to be an improbable proposition. so, the bjp this time around appears to have fashioned a rather convoluted strategy to rally support over the temple issue: the vishwa hindu parishad will raise the issue, the opposition will react and blame the bjp, and the bjp will then be ''required to clarify'' its stand. also, the bjp seems to have adopted a three-pronged strategy in up with an eye on its upper caste vote-bank. the ayodhya issue would be raised by the parivar, the bjp would campaign that the congress and samajwadi party are opposed to poto and the ban on simi because they want to woo muslim votes, and, of course, the ''offensive'' against pakistan and ''patriotism'' would loom over the political horizon. the vhp's sant yatra will set out from ayodhya on january 20 and will reach delhi on january 27 to meet the pm. ''our attempt is to appraise leaders of the situation in ayodhya. the dharmacharyas will meet only the pm, and our workers along with certain mps will meet all leaders,'' said vhp vice-president acharya giriraj kishore. those political leaders who oppose the temple would apparently be dubbed as 'anti-hindu'. with a full-fledged vhp programme on, the opposition would have to take a stand on the issue on predictable political lines. and this would be an opportunity for the bjp to ''clarify its stand''. that, parivar strategists believe, would bring the temple issue back into focus just three weeks before the state polls. already, bjp general secretary in-charge of elections, pyarelal khandelwal, has made a serious charge against the opposition over the temple issue. talking to the times of india, khandelwal said, ''congress, bsp and samajwadi party have a hidden agenda. they have come to an understanding with certain groups promising them permission to build a mosque at the ramjanmabhumi if these parties come to power.''

3,Aviation policy proposes fund for social routes,"new delhi: here's some good news for domestic airlines. the draft civil aviation policy has proposed to compensate domestic carriers for their flights on economically-unviable social routes through the creation of an aviation fund. it also intends to scrap the present practice of mandatory linking of some uneconomical routes while allotting commercially-viable circuits to airlines, aviation ministry sources told the times of india. these non-viable routes mostly connect the north-eastern states, remote areas and smaller cities. under the current guidelines, airlines have to operate on these loss-making routes as a social obligation. the ministry has also proposed exempting all the existing flights to the north-east from payment of the inland air travel tax. besides, it will provide aviation fuel at par with prices charged from international carriers, and rationalise airport charges. considering the present norms, every domestic airline has to take up category b routes (social, unviable) amounting to 10 per cent of the total commercial routes (category a) allotted to it by the civil aviation ministry. the creation of the aviation fund has found unanimous support among all aviation bodies. the idea of delinking viable and non-viable routes has been mooted by the planning commission. the plan panel opined that there should be separate allocation of both category a and category b routes without mandatory linking. these views have been incorporated in the draft policy. however, the civil aviation ministry was in favour of retaining the 10 per cent criteria. both these proposals would be placed before ccea, sources said. according to sources, the corpus would be created in tune with the civil aviation development fund, earlier proposed by the aviation ministry. but this time round, the fund would be created only for the domestic air carriers and not for the development of total aviation infrastructure (including airports) as proposed earlier. the new fund would be created primarily from contribution from the finance ministry. a contribution from airlines as a common pool is also being mulled. according to aviation industry officials, creation of this compensation fund can significantly improve the bottomlines of domestic carriers like indian airlines, jet airways and sahara airlines. ia, being a dominant player in this segment, nets a loss of rs 60 crore annually while catering to unviable routes in the n-e states. sources said the draft includes two proposals (26 per cent and 49 per cent) for foreign airline equity participation in domestic carriers.

4,Meet in Pune to question language policy,"pune: the government's policy on marathi, the official language of the state, is likely to come in for some serious grilling at the 75th marathi literary meet, which opens here in two weeks' time.the decision to offer information technology as an alternative to marathi at the junior college level has sparked off a heated reaction in literary circles. some of that heat is likely to be vented at a special session titled, `the language policy of state government is insulting to marathi', scheduled to be held on january 19, said g.n. joglekar, president of the akhil bharatiya marathi sahitya mahamandal, the chief organising body of marathi literary meets. and those who are expected to take the hot seat on behalf of the government include ulhas pawar from the state statutory development board and a.g. patil from the language directorate.addressing a press conference here on wednesday, mr joglekar explained that after the formation of the state in 1960, chief minister yashwantrao chavan had announced several steps and policies to promote marathi. ``people in the state would like to know what happened to those policies,'' he said.on being asked why the literary body accepted rs 25 lakhs from the state government earlier this week, if it was so opposed to its language policy, mr joglekar said that just by accepting assistance from the government, the meeting was not obliged to discuss subjects agreeable to the government. ``we have our views and they will be expressed firmly,'' he added. he, however, clarified that the meeting should not be taken as a battlefield.the meeting will be inaugurated by history scholar babasaheb purandare at the police parade ground on january 18 at 3.30 pm. president-elect rajendra banhatti will take over charge from the outgoing president, vijaya rajadhyaksha. the inaugural session will be followed by a story-telling session in memory of the late vyankatesh madgulkar and the late `vapu' kale who pioneered story-telling in modern times.a seminar on the contribution of public libraries, an interview session with noted author shivaji sawant, an interaction between children and writers, dramatisation of works of departed litterateurs in which stage and screen actors will participate are some of the other highlights of the sammelan

""i am keeping the option of recovering the whole amount from the powerloom sector open,"" he insisted. referring to his meeting with powerloom representatives on wednesday, he said, ""they do not seem to agree with our proposal to appoint a committee of three ministers, myself, industries minister suresh mehta and energy minister kaushik patel to look into the issue."" nitin said, ""i told them whatever the committee said should be acceptable. they wanted an urgent solution and continuation of the subsidy. how can i do that when the matter is pending with the gujarat electricity regulatory commission for hearing?"" narottam expressed surprise at the belligerent attitude of nitin towards a group known to be his firm supporter in surat, but refused to comment. an official revealed, ""the minister believes the demand for subsidy is correct, or else a closure would follow.""

8,Infosys chief Narayan Murthy rejects govt offer,"kanpur: chairman of infosys software limited sr narayan murthy has rejected two important proposals of the state government. the proposals include setting up of software industries in the state and establishment of 'international institute of convergence technology' in kanpur. murthy said: there is a lack of entrepreneur-friendly environment in the state and proper air connectivity with other parts of the nation. inaugurating, the newly-constructed hr kadiam diwan building of the department of computer science and engineering at indian institute of technology here on thursday, he said that though there were several software technology parks (stps) and good companies but there was a dearth of customers in the state which diverted the entrepreneurs' attention. it may be recalled that the state government in collaboration with the industries ministry was planing to set up various departments under one roof. the departments included in this scheme were computer science, telecommunication, information technology, management, entertainment industries and application of biotechnology under international institute of convergence technology (iict) on a huge land near iit kanpur. when the director and commissioner of industries rn trivedi asked the infosys chairman about the iict proposal, murthy said the proposals were good and would also support students in setting up their industries. but the state did not have an ideal infrastructure which included power, air connectivity and entrepreneur-friendly environment, he added. talking to times news network, trivedi said that the infosys chairman had accepted the proposal to set up software industries in kanpur if the the infrastructure was modified and good air connectivity be ensured. addressing a workshop on 'current practices and future challenges in computer science', murthy also gave tips on how to become a successful industrialist. he said: firstly, the company must have a good idea of creating something different; secondly, a market place should be found so that the idea could be sold and thirdly an enthusiastic team in all fields like finance, sales and marketing, research and development, project management and technology should be nurtured. murthy favours autonomous iits kanpur: chairman of infosys, nr narayan murthy on thursday said he favoured autonomy of the iits and said ""direct or indirect interference of the government must be ended, especially in premier technological institutes like iits"". he also stressed on coordination among the government, entrepreneurs and academicians and stated that iits should take inputs from entrepreneurs so they could create a technocrat who could understand the demands of the market. murthy pointed out that state governments, especially of uttar pradesh and bihar should think seriously on why software entrepreneurs refrained from investing in their state.

9,"Now, govt. dithers on revoking helmet rule","pune: the confusion over the implementation of the helmet rule in the city continues with the government failing to file an affidavit on the matter, almost a month after chief minister vilasrao deshmukh announced his intention to revoke the rule. with all parties adopting a populist stand on the eve of civic elections and flaying the helmet compulsion which came into force on december 1, the delay in revoking it, is an obvious delaying tactic on the state government's part. fortunately for the government, the public interest litigation (pil) filed by symbiosis law college students asking for the compulsion of helmets could not come up for hearing on january 2 in the bombay high court. the case is now scheduled for a hearing on january 9. however, for implementing agencies like the traffic police and the regional transport authority, who are treating the cm's statement as an unofficial decree to lift the compulsion, it poses a catch 22 situation. this is because the high court has already hauled them over the coals for lenient implementation of the rule. l.p. khade, regional transport officer (rto), while speaking to this paper said he had not received any directive or notification revoking the original order to implement the helmets rule. in simple terms, the original order of the state to make the headgear compulsory still stands, for all practical purposes. even the traffic police have a similar story to tell. for want of an official orders, they keep wondering whether to penalise offenders of the helmet rule. dcp ravindra sengaonkar denied having received any official communication rescinding the original order. interestingly, on grounds both the authorities are lying low and are hardly taking any action against riders without helmets. sources say the government, in all probability, would take recourse to postponing the helmet rule. a final decision would be taken by the state only after the local body polls which are due in february, said the official. meanwhile, the transport department has sent letters to several ngos dealing with traffic issues to elicit their support in a mass awareness campaign on the use of helmets.

10,Congress to take on Modi in by-elections,"ahmedabad: gujarat pradesh congress committee president amarsinh chaudhary declared on thursday that the congress would take on chief minister narendra modi in the by-election as a unified whole and 'see to it that he does not climb even one step into the vidhan sabha'. talking to reporters at the weekly meeting, chaudhary also declared that ""modi was studying the ellisbridge constituency as a second option, which betrayed the fact that he was not sure of victory in rajkot"". chaudhary suggested modi to accept jaspal singh's offer and contest from sayajigunj in vadodara. according to him, making ex-finance minister vajubhai vala resign to make way for the rajkot -2 seat by-election 'was a strategy to cover up vala's misdeeds and scams'. chaudhary added that modi was perhaps afraid that his own people would aid his defeat in rajkot-2. ""we demand that the cm conduct an inquiry into vala's scams by a retired high court judge, and if he agrees we are ready to provide all the evidence to facilitate the investigation"", he said. asked to elaborate, chaudhary alleged that when he was minister vala and his associates, had 'traded off the prime property around the laxmivilas palace in vadodara spread over 11 sq miles to grant them an noc, which needs to be investigated'. the other charges, he pointed out was about vala being a partner in a firm called 'bleach chem' and he allegedly 'pressurised psus like gacl, gsfc and gnfc to purchase their products'. chaudhary's third charge: a case of land-grabbing by his son in the satyagraha chhavni area of ahmedabad and finally, his links with the cine-multiplexes and other projects when he had declared in the assembly that neither he nor his family had any link with any builder. asked when the congress would name its candidate, chaudhary said that it would be 'sooner than expected'. all said and done, chaudhary exuded confidence about defeating modi in the by-election.

11,MP's kin in hiding after firing incident at Jhalod,"vadodara: two pairs of cross-complaints were registered by the police in connection with the firing at jhalod village on wednesday. bjp mp babubhai katara's son bhavesh, the main accused in the case, is still at large. brother of the injured kalu garasiya, shankar, in his complaint alleged that the mp's sons bhavesh and hitesh were involved in the incident. feud over the mahudi village panchayat polls is said to be the reason for the attack. hirka katara, a friend of bhavesh, had lost the polls. meanwhile, a supporter of bhavesh, shamsu katara, alleged that 17 garasiyas were involved in an incident of stone-throwing at his residence. he said his house was targeted as he was a supporter of hirka. psi i a saiyed, meanwhile, filed a police complaint against a mob of 300 people alleging that they had attacked him. so there was a delay in carrying the victim of the firing incident to the hospital. he said he had gone to the spot on hearing of the firing. a cross-complaint by subhash agrawal, a shop owner, states that he was passing by the spot and saw a crowd. when he inquired about it, saiyed swore him and pointed a revolver at him. agrawal has alleged that the officer fired six rounds from the gun. police officials, however, said that the number of shots quoted by agrawal was inflated.

12,Lack of political clout affects south Gujarat,"surat: although south gujarat has earned the tag of being the most prosperous region in the state, but its failure to emerge as a strong lobby in the corridors of power is now being felt in terms of general apathy and step-motherly treatment by ruling parties to issues pertaining to the region. issues related to development, which have been dragging for years, show that the region do not have any political clout compared with the saurashtra lobby which is known to issue threats to make or break political equations in the state. even after being the biggest contributor to the state and national exchequer by way of taxes, surat and other areas of south gujarat have always been left isolated to nurse their developmental works on their own, say political observers. the most-favoured status to certain region-specific groups within ruling parties over the years has helped to raise lobby politics to such an extent that today political considerations are mostly based on distinctions of 'have-ones' and 'have-nots' in terms of clout. ""politico-demographic observations of various regions are enough indications to find out which region-specific lobby dictates the ruling regime,"" said i j desai, chairman, surat citizens council trust. he added that issues related to this region are taken for granted at gandhinagar. the ruling regime ignores issues related to south gujarat due to the lack of damage threats, either to the organisational set-up of the party or leaving the political space to rival parties. but, if the same issues pertain to saurashtra region, the party gets extra cautious keeping in view its implications, feel political observers. therefore, one finds issues related to surat and its surrounding areas - like developing the airport, a proper court building, suitable premises for the district jail, developing magadalla port, proper use of gidc-owned sheds at icchapore, the garment park, a proper city transportation system and many more - being totally ignored or to be progressing at snail's pace. ""the ruling parties never take these issues seriously and assurances are mostly forgotten,"" said former chief minister amarsinh choudhary. no wonder, parameters set to identify the intensity of regional clout and its inherent damaging capacity have gained a different dimension. ""the feeling among the elected representatives and the general public here is either of being pushed to the wall or showered with favours, depending on the respective political lobby within the party,"" feels city congress unit president pratapsinh kantharia. he added that the region has since long been without any voice at gandhinagar and even delhi. it is, however, ironical that though the maximum funding for political parties are from this region, it never attained a commanding political tone for getting problems solved, he said. ""the feeling of discrimination prevails among the common people. they frequently complain that issues are not being pursued as vigorously as they should be due to poor political clout,"" said city bjp unit president, kishore wanakawala. but there is a difference between the general perception and actual facts as the government too has been doing its best to come up with solutions, he added cautiously. for the development of industries, the required co-ordination of various agencies has been lacking most of the times, said praful shah, president, southern gujarat chamber of commerce & industries. however, city mp and union textiles minister kashiram rana denied of any lobby politics in the state. if the saurashtra lobby has more clout so does have the south gujarat lobby, he said. there is nothing like these divisions and there has been sincere efforts in all fronts for this region as well, rana pointed out. when asked about the ongoing agitation by the powerloom industry on the issue of high power tariff, he said the government should take a favourable decision soon. but, for many in the powerloom sector here, the government so far has done nothing in this regard and even assurances have been just an eye-wash, said yogesh mehra, general secretary of federation of gujarat weavers association (fogwa). on the issue of the court building, the general impression even at the law ministry is that the problem could have been solved long back if it pertained to saurashtra region, according to sources. it is surprising that state law minister hemant chapatwala is from this city and even 11 months after the earthquake, in which the court building was damaged, no suitable decision has been taken, say legal practitioners. but with the removal of former chief minister keshubhai patel, who reportedly patronised the saurashtra lobby, there certainly has been some changes in the political lobby equations in the state. this can be observed from the fact that if the saurashtra lobby compelled keshubhai to grant an interim relief of 30 per cent deferment on power tariff for powerloom units, the same group is finding it difficult to gain confidence of the present chief minister narendra modi, for the continuance of the same relief, feel political analysts.

13,"Now, buy cheap fruits, vegetables from farmers","pune: middlemen have traditionally cornered all the juice in the fruit and vegetable market, but farmers and consumers may get their 'revenge' yet. in a unique initiative the maharashtra state agriculture marketing board (msamb) has decided to open special outlets for farmers to sell their produce directly to consumers. the first such outlet has already started functioning at the grahak peth consumer co-operative departmental store on tilak road, while the second outlet was inaugurated at the maharashtra state co-operative consumer federation in mumbai on tuesday. in the initial stages, seasonal fruits will be sold at these outlets. more outlets will eventually be opened in other parts of the state. the price differential is substantial according to bhaskar patil, manager, publicity and public relations, msamb. he said oranges were being presently sold at rs 25 per dozen at the grahak peth outlet, as against the market rate of rs 35. the oranges are being brought directly from the varud agriculture market produce committee in amravati and transported in special refrigerated vans provided by msamb. the farmers benefit from the system as it bypasses a long chain of middlemen like commission agents, weighing agents and transporters, who have hitherto skimmed the margins in the business. patil explains that earlier farmers earned barely 30 paise out of every re 1 spent by the consumer. with nearly 12.5 lakh hectares of land in the state coming under cultivation, newer distribution alternatives are becoming increasingly important. some six lakh hectares is already in production, and is rest will do so in the next four years, thus making a efficient sales network at the state, national and international levels, crucial. consumer co-operatives, co-operative banks and big housing societies can all act as direct outlets. after oranges, grapes, pomegranates, mangoes and bananas will be directly marketed. the state currently produces 570 million tonnes of grapes every season, while 70,000 hectares of land is under pomegranate cultivation. grahak peth director suryakant pathak told the times of india that the outlet has received excellent response from citizens. as many as 60 crates of 20 dozen oranges each were sold in the first two days. pathak confirmed that other fruits will soon be available at the grahak peth outlet. ""in fact we are also looking for farmers who will sell vegetables directly to people and we are ready to provide space to them,"" he added.

14,Afroze likely to be booked under terror law,"mumbai: mohammed afroze (26), alleged al-qaeda operative who was arrested in october last year, may be booked under the prevention of terrorism ordinance (poto), according to intelligence sources.with the union cabinet re-promulgating the ordinance on saturday, afroze, or prisoner no. 4155 at the byculla central prison, will in all likelihood become the first person in the state to be booked under poto, said the sources. the country's first case under poto was registered in strife-torn jammu and kashmir in november. recently, the delhi police booked those arrested in connection with the attack on parliament on december 13 under poto.the mumbai police had refrained from booking afroze under poto although he had allegedly confessed to being part of a suicide squad that was to crash a plane into the british house of commons on september 11. but the sources explained that afroze should be booked under poto not only because of the nature of his offence (sedition), but also in view of the threat to his life.``ever since he was arrested on october 2, he has been remanded to either police or judicial custody. given the nature of the investigation as well as the threats faced by afroze, the police would ideally prefer to keep him under judicial custody for the longest possible period,'' the sources said.``afroze is being periodically remanded to police and judicial custody because of the different offences that he has been booked for. but this cannot continue for very long,'' they said.moreover, it is only under the maharashtra control of organised crime act (mcoca) or poto that a chargesheet can be filed in 180 days. until the chargesheet is filed, the accused can normally be denied bail in case of serious offences. it's another matter that afroze has so far refused to either hire a lawyer or apply for bail.interestingly, the metropolitan court where afroze is produced for remand does not have the jurisdiction to entertain his bail application since he has been charged for conspiring to undertake terrorist activities in india and abroad under sections 121 (a), 126 and 120 (b) of the indian penal code. these offences can be tried by the sessions court.meanwhile, there has been no further developments in the investigation because most of the incidents relating to the case took place overseas, including afroze's pilot training in the u.s., the uk and australia.``the so-called plan to crash a plane into the house of commons was also hatched abroad, and the key players in the conspiracy are also based there. afroze's maternal uncle, mubarak mussalman, who gave him huge sums of money and is wanted in the case, is based in london,'' the sources said. it is not certain if the police have made any effort to extradite mussalman, but they believe that he can throw light on the source of funding for afroze's aviation training.the sources said that investigations now had to be carried out in foreign countries in order to gather documentary evidence pertaining to afroze's conversations on his global-roaming cell phone. the investigations could also throw some light on the transactions carried out through his anz bank account in australia as well as his debit cards.``but all this could lead to a lot of delay, and is possible only after the cbi, which is the interpol's coordinating agency in india, and the union ministry of external affairs succeed in convincing the police forces abroad about the need to assist our men in the investigations,'' a senior officer said.

17,Forex earnings through books increased 12 times,"vijayawada: the foreign exchange earnings through export of indian books has increased by 12 times in the last six years, director of national book trust (nbt), nirmal kanti bhattacharjee said on thursday. the foreign exchange earnings were rs 30 crore in 1995 and had gradually picked up to rs 350 crore during 2001, he said while speaking to reporters on the sidelines of vijayawada book festival. the nbt, which functions under the aegis of union human resources development ministry, was striving to create awareness among the students about the importance of reading books by organising festivals, fairs and interaction with publishers, bhattacharjee said. since the central government declared this year as a year of books, the nbt would organise a world book fair at new delhi from january 28 to february four wherein atleast 1200 publishers from various countries are expected to take part, he added. bhattacharjee said that nbt with its regional centres at bangalore, kolkata, mumbai and delhi is making every effort to inculcate habit of reading among the students. nbt's prime concern was to encourage publishers and authors by extending support, bhattacharjee said, adding the trust had also launched mobile book shops as part of its promotional campaign.

27,Black coat waiver jolts lawyers,"bangalore: ""during summer wearing black coat is not mandatory. in place of black coat, black gown and white bands are mandatory in all the courts."" this is the clause of resolution no.121/01 of the bar council of india which has caused an uproar amongst a major section of advocates and members of the bar council. for the first time in the legal history of the country, the black coat has been made optional during court sessions. due to grouses of advocates from all over india that the black coat was too uncomfortable in the summer heat, the bar council has amended the rules pertaining to black coats being mandatory making them optional during the months of april and may. v.t.rayaraddi, chairman state bar council, who is totally against this amendment said, ""the black coat represents mourning for injustice. how can it be made optional? it maintains the dignity and decorum of the court. i am very upset about this amendment."" he went on to say that advocates could wear coats of a thinner material during the summer months but doing away with the coat is like wiping out the mark of justice itself. he also emphasised that mostlawyers do not even wear sober coloured shirts which is also mandatory. "" instead we have lawyers who wear brightly coloured shirts and printed sarees which is absolutely appalling. i have decided to appeal to the bar associations all over the country."" advocate hemalatha mahishi agreed with rayaraddi's thought, ""if advocates do not wear black coats then there is no distinction between them and the clients. it is a dignified dress and one should have it on at all times."" according to mahishi a lot of lady advocates also violate the rules of the amendment by not wearing the white band which stands for purity. she said that the dress code is not followed by most advocates which reduces the sanctity of the court. veena, another lady advocate, too felt that a dress code with the coat is necessary. ""the coat is absolutely necessary though i wouldn't mind if the it is of a lighter colour because it does get a little uncomfortable in summer. it should be of a neutral colour like brown or cream."" a.vijay sai, another advocate, also feels that a lawyer's mark is the black coat. ""relaxing the rules regarding the pants is acceptable but not regarding the coat. a lawyer can lose his clients by not wearing a coat."" all these advocates can do right now is wait and see what action the bar association takes regarding the dress code, especially the controversy about the black coat. till then, the scorching summer months are going to be a little more comfortable for the men in black and white.
