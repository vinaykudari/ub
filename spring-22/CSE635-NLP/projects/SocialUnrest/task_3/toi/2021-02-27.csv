0,Costly equipment remain underused at AIIMS,"NEW DELHI: About a year back, the Centre for Cardiothoracic and Vascular Sciences (CTVS) at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) had acquired equipment worth more than Rs 5 crore for robotic heart surgery.

Till date, the equipment has been used to perform no more than five heart surgeries (two of them unsuccessful), a blatant instance of the gross misuse that public funds in India are subjected to.

Compare the AIIMS figures with those of the Escorts Heart Institute and Research Centre and the contrast is striking. In a little over one year and two months'' time, the private institute has performed more than 120 robotic heart surgeries.

Interestingly, before the present equipment was bought, AIIMS already had robotic surgery equipment. A senior CTVS official said, ""That robot could just about prise open the rib cage ahead of an operation. Although it was worth Rs 2 crore, it wasn''t used more than couple of times. The reason: it took more time than a doctor doing the same job.""

The equipment still lies in the CTVS operation theatre. The official added, ""This is because it was bought just six-seven years ago. It cannot be condemned without raising questions at the time of audit.""

AIIMS director Dr P Venugopal, who is also the CTVS chief, refused to comment on the issue. Medical superintendent Dr R K Sarma said, ""I am not the right person to comment on surgeries. But if a particular operation has not been performed too many times, it must be because enough patients are not available.""

That seems strange logic for an institute where senior officials never tire talking of patient overload.

Another question that needs to be answered is that if the institute just gets five patients a year who benefit from such costly equipment, then why was it procured?

Former AIIMS director Dr P K Dave, during whose tenure the machine was bought, said, ""I don''t know anything about this machine. The requisition for buying it was never sent to me.""

This, despite the fact that there is a norm at the institute that any purchase or construction work worth more than Rs 50 lakh, has to be approved by the director, the expenditure finance committee of the Union health ministry and the internal finance division of AIIMS.

Dr Sarma''s excuse that not all methods of surgery are suitable for all patients, also fails to convince.

Because according Escorts executive director Dr Naresh Trehan, the only limitation of the robotic method is that it cannot be performed on obese patients and on people with severe lung diseases.

1,CM rules out water privatisation,"NEW DELHI: Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit on Friday ruled out any moves on the part of her government to privatise water supply.

After Thursday''s cabinet decision to set up a water regulatory commission, fears were raised that this would be the first step towards privatisation like in the case of power.

""The regulatory commission has been set up to keep a check on the wastage and quality of water and to replenish groundwater in Delhi,"" she said.

She denied that the government was in any way ''influenced by the World Bank (WB) report''. She said that the WB report had, in fact, said that privatisation of water had failed everywhere.

""It is, therefore, wrong to say that pressure from the World Bank report drove us to set up a regulatory commission,"" she said.

2,Cong kicks off election campaign in Surat,"SURAT: Kicking off the election campaign in Surat, All-India Congress Committee (AICC) party spokesperson and youth Congress leader Meenakshi Natrajan on Friday highlighted the partyâ€™s â€˜Disha 2004 - Shiksha Aur Rojgarâ€™.

She was speaking at meet of party workers here in Surat.

Speaking to the local media persons, Natrajan said that the Congress, with its development-oriented programmes, promises to provide sustainable and meaningful employment to the Indian youth across the country. She also said that the party was committed to focus on quality education. Outlining the achievements of former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi in empowering the Indian youth, by reducing the minimum age for voting to 18 years, she said it was the Congress initiatives that brought information technology (IT) and modern telecommunications to the country providing jobs to millions.

Adding that the party leaders across the country were in consultation with the local youth to understand needs at local levels, Natrajan said that a comprehensive plan could then be worked out for generating employment. In fact, a core group of the young leaders from various parts of the country had already been formed. This core group would aim at making each youth a skilled human resource person for competing at global level, Natarajan said. But for all this, she emphasised, the restructuring of the Indian education system and a stable harmonious environment was necessary and claimed that the only the Congress party would be able to achieve this.

Hitting out at the NDAled government for its prorich policies, she said that the fee of the elite Indian Institute of Management (IIMs) has been reduced while majority of children in the country were still denied access to primary education. The BJP-led government at the Centre had completely failed to protect the interest of the farmers and the overall economy has suffered badly, Natrajan added.

3,An obese govt eating into exchequer,"LUCKNOW: UP is a classic case of an obese government which is feeding like a glutton on the fast-dwindling exchequer. While there are 32 ministers in excess of the permissible limit of 60 fixed under the Act cleared recently by the Parliament, nearly 100 IAS officers are working on technically non-existent posts of super-time scales.

The Act envisages that the number of ministers should not be more than the 15 per cent of the total strength of the Assembly. Thus in the case of UP, the number of ministers can be 60 as the strength of the House is 404. As against this, there are 92 ministers at present. So chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav is duty-bound to shed the excess weight of his ministry within the deadline of six-months ending on July 6 set under the Act.

But then it is also an irony that a cash-starved state like UP is affording a bloated, top heavy administration â€”a quarter of which is made up of technically non-existent posts. Some 100 IAS officers, mostly of the rank of joint secretary to the Union government and above, have unauthorised jobs in which they draw salaries, have designations, but little work.

These unauthorised posts are a needless drain on the exchequer. There are 467 IAS officers in the state but against the initial norm of having three posts of chief secretary in the scale of Rs 26,000, there are as many as 15 officers working at present on different posts. And strangely, in utter violation of norms, many of them have been posted within the secretariat. Conventionally, officers at par with the CS are posted outside the secretariat.

Likewise, against the sanctioned posts of 16 principal secretaries and 28 secretaries, their numbers are 45 and 60 respectively in the state. The number of secretaries will actually go up to 100 if taken into account all those officers placed on field postings.

The state has thus ended up, being extremely top heavy. This is evident by the fact that the finance department and the CM secretariat have two principal secretaries each as against the sanctioned strength of one each. The home department, which stands divided into three departments, viz., home, jail and home guards, are headed by three principal secretaries.

This has also lead to a piquant situation in which a recalcitrant bureaucrat finds himself saddled with a meaningless post which carries a title and no work while his juniors shoulder important jobs. Thus there are a host of senior officers, who have to contend with departments like programme implementation, fisheries, sports and national integration, etc., without much work.

And still there are many who are given more than one key post, making them more powerful than ministers. Not surprising, officers prefer not to go on deputation to the Central government unless they are certain of plum posting. A case in point is of industries development commissioner (IDC), Sujit Banerjee, who is said to have declined to go to the Centre despite his order for posting.

4,IIM-A to debate govt-assured 'autonomy',"AHMEDABAD: Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad (IIM-A) will â€œseek opinionâ€� from all possible quarters on the Union HRD ministryâ€™s undertakings to the Supreme Court on Friday, especially on the issue of its assurance on not disturbing the autonomy of the IIMs.

The apex court disposed off a PIL filed by two IIM students and an alumnus on the fee cut issue after the ministry gave two undertakings, the other being meeting the shortfall.

In Mumbai, chairman of the board of governors of IIM-A N R Narayana Murthy said the board would meet on April 3 to discuss, debate and review the situation and take appropriate action. Reacting to the Supreme Courtâ€™s decision to dispose off the PIL challenging reduction in fee, Murthy said the PIL was filed by three individuals and not by the IIM board or the society.

The April 3 meet,which was slated to discuss the fee cut issue, will now have another important agenda â€” to â€œexamine the implications of the assurances regarding IIMsâ€™ autonomy given by the ministry to the Supreme Court.â€�

â€œThe board will also discuss the situation arising out of the disposal of the PIL in the context of the specific assurances given by the government. We will examine the issue in detail, including the definition of autonomy as we feel that effective operational autonomy is an important element that determines the quality of all our activities,â€� said IIM-A director Bakul Dholakia.

When asked whether the IIMs would seek legal opinion, Dholakia said the â€œboard will consider the issue in totality.â€� Dholakia said there is no specific action plan regarding the Supreme Courtâ€™s observation about the locus standi of those who filed the petition and why the IIMs themselves did not come forward. Asked whether the IIMs would be able to manage its finances if the government fixes the subsidy at the present difference in fees brought about by the cut â€” Rs 1.20 lakh â€” for times to come, Dholakia said the economics of the fee cut can be â€œworked out in a variety of ways.â€� The IIM-A director had earlier indicated that though the fee per student was Rs 1.5 lakh per annum, the IIM-A spent about Rs 3 to Rs 4 lakh on every student a year.

â€œIt has to be noted that apex court has not dismissed but disposed off the PIL only after the ministry gave the undertakings. This also means that if it goes back on them at any point of time, it can be charged with contempt of court,â€� says one of the petitioners, Saikat Sengupta, a PGP student at IIM-A.

â€œWe got far more than we had wanted in the petition, where we wanted autonomy but not at the cost of a fee cut. The also found that the IIMs were free to pursue whatever remedies they thought fit,â€� said IIM alumnus and lawyer Sandeep Parekh, who is a copetitioner.

5,Excise minister's son wants licence to drink,"MUMBAI: Guess who is rushing to get a drinking permit? None other than excise minister Anil Deshmukh''s son Salil, who admits he has been tippling without one so far.

""The rules were never implemented strictly and I did not know it was needed. Now I intend to get a permit before I party the next time,"" says the 23-year-old Nagpur student, who loves to hang out with friends in pubs. ""I am not a party animal. But I drink occassionally and go out once in 15 days.""

Salil also defends his father''s diktat banning youths under the age of 21 from entering discos and pubs.

""Even abroad you cannot buy drinks without showing your proof of age. I have been asked to producemy passport many times outside India.""

The senior Deshmukh announced his decision on Thursday after he found several youngsters in pubs and discos during his raids on night clubs and dance bars.

Salil does not agree with the young brigade''s claim that partying is not all about boozing and that even though they are under 21 they should be allowed in pubs.

""You are bound to down a couple of drinks in such an environment,"" he claims.

But he sympathises with some of his under-21 friends. ""It is painful for them, but we should also think of the parents,"" he says.

Some of his younger friends have complained about not being able to party. ""But since they are just six months short of 21, I have told them that in a matter of months they will be able to join us,"" he says.

However, he has no answer when asked about the need to implement archaic rules like demanding a permit to buy and drink liquor. ""That''s something I would not like to comment on,"" he says rather uncomfortably.

6,Zira to float party,"FEROZEPUR: Inderjit Singh Zira, senior Akali Dal (Badal) leader and former minister who was denied a ticket for the Lok Sabha elections, has decided to float a new party, ""Shiromani Akali Dal (Longowal)â€™â€™, on March 16 if Parkash Singh Badal does not review the names of candidates for the Lok Sabha polls by then.

Speaking to newspersons, here on Friday, Zira accused Badal of entering into a secret understanding with chief minister Amarinder Singh and fielding weak candidates. ""The history of SAD clearly proves that anyone who dares to speak against Badal or his style of functioning is killed politicallyâ€™â€™, he said.

Zira said they would urge all Akali factions and the Lok Bhilai Party to collectively fight against SAD candidates. Meanwhile, the Akali Dal headed by Simranjit Singh Mann has offered to support the new outfit.

7,Black day observed to protest fee hike,"CHANDIGARH: Protesting against the Panjab University''s proposed fee hike of ten per cent in university department and 25 per cent for the professional courses and the ""anti-student policies"" of the Punjab government, activists of Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) observed black day on Friday in the university and colleges.

The activists wore black badges and raised slogans against the university authorities and Punjab government and burnt the effigy of the both these bodies outside the vice-chancellor''s office.

The activists, led by Saurabh Joshi, claimed that the Punjab government, which had withdrawn the fee hike in universities and colleges across the state has so far failed to refund the excess money to the students, while PU is burdening the students with plans to charge them more fee from the next session.

8,Witty Modi sparks laugh riot,"BETTIAH: BJP''s poll campaign curtain raiser sparked off a riot here on Friday. The Pramod Mahajan-led managers of the saffron brigade gave an indication of what to expect as the campaign picks up momentum in coming days.

Mahajan and Co used their gift of the gab to devastating effect. So what if the crowd was disappointing. That did not deter them from firing on all cylinders. And they triggered a riot. Mahajan cracked jokes, turned serious and promised the moon. He took digs at Sonia and Laloo, called Vajpayee great, promised a feel better tomorrow.

""In five years more with Vajpayee at the helm, beggars will use cell phone, seeking alms by SMS,"" he said. But the surprise package in Mahajan''s bandwagon was Sushil Kumar Modi. Modi retained his deadpan expression and dialogue delivery. Yet, there was definite image make-over. Whether it was the result of exposure to the working of American democracy, or the outcome of BJP''s in-house training programmes, one wasn''t sure, but the leader of opposition in Bihar assembly used wit and satire with deadly effect. It sparked a riot.

Modi compared the performance of the Union and Bihar government. ""Whatever runs in Bihar runs due to the Union government,"" he maintained, elaborating, ""When dacoities are committed on trains, the state government is responsible."" ""The feel good network of basic and mobile telephony has been rung in by the Centre; but when you receive extortion and ransom calls, it is the state government''s doing.""

Modi''s dig sparked laugh riot. He fanned the riot even more. ""When you watch TV, you thank the Centre but when the TV set goes dead due to power failure, you know the state government has spoilt your party.""

The riot of laughter turned into an uproar when Modi said wherever in Bihar you come across roads as smooth as Hema Malini''s cheeks, it is the Centre''s achievement, but the roads, pot holed like our Puri''s cheeks, are the state government''s doing.""

9,Stray incidents mark bandh,"RANCHI: The MCC and the Peopleâ€™s War jointly struck terror a few hours earlier than their proposed bandh on Friday, when the outfits blew up the Hariharganj telephone exchange in Palamu district late on Thursday evening.

The MCC and PW jointly called for a Jharkhand and Bihar bandh to protest against state repression, forced election on the people of the country and fraud committed on citizens in the name of development from funds taken as loan from foreign agencies. The bandh also covered states like Andhra Pradesh and Chhatisgarh.

Though the home secretary, JB Tubid, described the bandh as a near flop, the extremists, however, managed to lock up the Dania railway station near Koderma on Thursday night disrupting rail traffic on the Dhanbad division for a few hours.

On the other hand, the effect of the bandh was felt in strongholds of the outfits in the state. In Garhwa, according to the SP, small and big vehicles largely kept off the roads while vehicles hardly plied on the Ranchi-Tata national highway. Markets in the town areas were open, though the rural areas were affected in most of these places.

In Ranchi, though the effect of the bandh was not felt at all, some private schools preferred to remain closed and the ongoing matriculation examination was also postponed in view of the bandh.

According to Tubid, the state was by and large peaceful barring a few stray incidents of violence last night amidst tight security arrangements as more than 70-80 companies of CRPF and district armed police had been deployed in view of the bandh. The home secretary also claimed that transportation of coal from the various collieries of the Central Coalfields Ltd (CCL) and BCCL was almost normal.

A Kumar adds from Koderma: At about 1 am on Thursday, about 100 extremists stormed the Dasra block halt, about 30-km from Koderma railway station, and after damaging the railway cabin also set it on fire.

The extremists also took away KS Mandal, cabin master, and Jagdish Mahto, a porter, alongwith them and left them at 5.30 in the morning.

Following the incident, train services between Dhanbad and Gaya railway stations on Grand Chord section were disrupted for several hours. Many passenger and goods trains were stranded at different railway stations.

Abhijit Sen adds from Hazaribag: The bandh call badly affected the rail and road traffic in Hazaribag district, said SP Anurag Gupta.

All long-distance buses were off the road. Besides, loading and dispatch of coal in the various collieries of the district were totally paralysed as no trucks turned up at the colliery pits. However, the production of coal continued as per schedule.

The strike did not affect the working of government offices and other commercial organisations.

Barun Sengupta adds from Chaibasa: The MCC-PW bandh evoked a mixed response here. Most of the shops and business establishement remained open and business activities were as usual. However, buses, trucks and heavy vehicles were off the roads.

School, colleges and offices were also open. District administration had made elaborate security arrangements and no untoward incient was reported.

13,Trains bear brunt of Naxal bandh,"NEW DELHI: Rail traffic passing through states of Bihar, Jharkhand and eastern Uttar Pradesh were widely disrupted, when Left extremists of the Maoist Communist Centre and the Peoples War Group, went about attacking railway property and indulging in sabotage activities since Thursday night, as part of their ''bandh'' call.

The disruption that began on Thursday 9 pm onwards continued to adversely affect the rail traffic movement even in the rest of the country till Friday afternoon, even though railway authorities claimed that the situation had been largely brought under control with the help of the state government and central assistance.

The specific target of MCC and PWG attack were the railway properties in places under East Central Railway in Dhanbad, Mughalsarai and Samastipur Divisions.

About 60 persons gathered at Danea station in Dhanbad division at 9.10 pm on Thursday and they abducted the station master on duty, resulting in disruption of railway services on Gomia-Barkakhana section.

There was also a bomb blast in the wee hours around 2 am on Friday, at Dasarah station on Gomoh-Manpur section resulting in the closure of trains movement.

14,GAIL at full blast as govt FIs toe Shourie's line,"MUMBAI: The government''s bullying tactics seem to have had their desired impact. Gail''s mega-issue of Rs 1,600 crore was oversubscribed 1.1 times on the first day itself, while the IBP, CMC and Dredging Corporation issues were finally completely subscribed as well.

The market also behaved; the sensex gaining 2% to close at 5667 points after a slip-sliding week, where it lost 3 per cent.

An ebullient Arun Shourie told reporters in New Delhi that despite the scepticism, the government would meet its disinvestment target. There was no more talk of action against market manipulators. ""When the response is so good why talk about things of the past,"" he said.

The big positive for Gail was the first-day participation of large domestic institutions led by LIC, said brokers. According to sources, the government took no chances with Gail''s issue, and it won''t with ONGC''s Rs 10,000 crore mega-issue either.

""It seems Mr Shourie has managed to jolt domestic institutions out of their usual slumber,"" said a dealer. ""Otherwise these players wait till offer closing day before investing.""

Market players say the finance ministry''s increased involvement is also having an impact, since the Gail and ONGC issues are primarily for meeting the government''s revised disinvestment target of Rs 14,500 crore.

Finance secretary D C Gupta, who met RBI governor Y V Reddy on Friday, is understood to have stressed the role of nationalised banks in making these two mega issues successful.

15,Drug addicts increasing in schools,"HISAR: ""The increasing drug addiction among teenagers is a matter of concern for the parents round the globe. In England the authorities are using sniffer dogs to detect and nab the addicts in the hostels or schools. In my school I had to expel two girls found guilty of consuming LSD. The precautions and strictness have yielded good results and the menace has been contained to a larger extent, said Ms. Pam Barber, Principal, Lancaster Girls Grammar School , Lancaster, United Kingdom, while talking to this correspondent on the last day her four-day visit here on Saturday.

Ms. Pam Barber had come to visit Vidya Devi Jindal School under an exchange programme funded by the British Council. The students and teachers of both the schools have already conducted one tour to each other''s school.

Ms. Pam Barber disclosed that about one hundred girls of both the schools are in regular correspondence with each other and exchange views through internet too. Since the world is now a global village the schools in future shall produce the global citizens having knowledge of culture, religion and traditions of other nations. It cements the

human-bonding.

She said,"" The Indian students are very respectful and polite to their teachers and have maintained age-old heritage. The Indian food and festivals have left indelible impression on my mind. There are many similarities between both the schools but the schools here are spacious and more conducive to the temple of learning.

In the near future the students of both the countries would be able to see each other''s classes live on the TV through video conferencing.

The students of England are taking keen interest in Holi and Diwali festivals of India and the students of

India have adopted the Valentines Day more than us. A society of multi-culturalism is coming up gradually .

In reply to a question she said,"" The children reaching the age of 11 are not given home work more than one hour and the boys and girls between 15 to 18 devote two to three hours for home work but they are provided full opportunity for sports , music and other extra curricular activities.

The teachers are sent for periodical training to fight obsolescence (forgetfulness). Principal of Vidya Devi Jindal School Ms. Shyama Kriplani said that the exchange programme has proved very beneficial for the students and teachers of her school. It has broadened the horizons and perception underlying the need of the times.

16,UDF govt is 'inefficient': Javdekar,"KOCHI: The BJP on Saturday charged the Congress-led United Democratic Front in Kerala with being ''inefficient'' on utilisation of central allocations.

The party would soon come out with a list of allocations which had not been utilised by the state government, BJP''s National Spokesperson Prakash Javdekar told reporters here.

Javdekar, who was here to conduct a media workshop of the party, said the party hopes to open its account in Kerala this time to the Lok Sabha. BJP would put up candidates in all the 20 seats and hoped to win at least six seats. The response of the people towards the party was good, giving them the confidence of winning six seats, he said.

Asked when BJP would finalise its candidate list, he said by March 10, all the state units of the party have been asked to sent their recommendations to the central election committee, which will finalise the list in Delhi.

Describing UDF and LDF as two faces of a coin, he alleged that the two fronts were ''cheating'' Kerala voters.

NDA government was going to polls with the incumbency factor and BJP hopes to do well in the southern states.

The media workshop was held to give the party cadres an insight into the National Information media network being set up which will have 100 well-equipped regional centres all over the country.
