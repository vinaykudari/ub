0,DC seeks removal of tainted principal,"FARIDKOT: The controversy over the appointment of a tainted principal of a private school as head of the flying squad for Faridkot and Ferozepur districts further deepened as the education department authorities took no initiative to remove the principal despite Faridkot deputy commissioner asking the principal secretary, school education, to raise the issue with Punjab School Education Board (PSEB) authorities.

In a semi-official letter to the principal secretary, Faridkot deputy commissioner Hussan Lal has asked the principal secretary to sack Jagdish Rai Sharma, principal of MRSD School, Faridkot, and state president of RASA (Recognised and Affiliated Schools Association) from the post of the head of flying squad for latterâ€™s dubious character.

The deputy commissioner demanded removal of Sharma for he allegedly created nuisance at an examination centre at Government Balbir Senior Secondary School, here on March 2. Though Sharma had no authority to inspect the examination centre, to settle personal scores with the school management, he entered the examination centre and stripped a number of students, appearing in physical test for plus two.

Earlier in a complaint to the secretary, PSEB, the centre superintendent, deputy superintendent, examiners, almost all students of the centre and district development and panchayat officer (DDPO) who was deputed by the deputy commissioner for smooth conduct of examination, accused Sharma of harassing the students and wasting their precious onehour time.

It is alleged that Sharma brought some slips (copying material) in his pocket and attempted to implicate some students in the centre. When the examiners at the centre opposed this act of Sharma, it created a lot of hullabaloo and at the receiving end were the students. Despite such behaviour of Sharma, who was involved in a number of controversies for alleged fake enrolment of science students and mass copying in his school, the authorities in the education department took no action against him. Rather he was elevated in his status by making him head of flying squad for one more district on March 16.

In March 2003, the then deputy commissioner Faridkot, A Venu Parshad, had ordered an inquiry into the functioning of MRSD School.

The inquiry was conducted by ADC Faridkot which demanded the director general (school) and PSEB authorities for necessary action against Sharma for a number of financial and administrative anomalies.

While the education department is still sitting on the inquiry report, this year Sharma changed the name of his school from MRSD School to SD School. Sources in the education department said that the motive for this move was to bury all record of the MRSD School, which was examined by the ADC during the probe. Sharma denied of having such motive for changing the name of the school and accused his rivals in the business for floating all these theories.

Sharma is known for organising frequent parties for political leaders and senior police officers and doling out precious gifts. Some days back, his offering of 100 gm gold bracelet at the marriage of a son of a senior functionary in the education department was the talk of town. But Sharma denied giving any special gift to anyone.

â€˜â€˜It was not so costly but a usual marriage gift to the couple,â€™â€™ claimed Sharma.

6,HC fumes as DSP stays arrest warrant,"PATNA: The Patna High Court on Monday ordered former Tirhut DIG Shridhar Sharma and Sheohar DSP Gagandeo Ram to be present in the court on April 12 in connection with initiation of criminal procedure against them for their interference in the execution of a court order.

The order was passed by a division bench comprising of Justice S K Singh and Justice V N Sinha.

The sub-divisional judicial magistrate, Sheohar, had issued a warrant of arrest against one Pradeep Kumar, who was in Motihari, in a case related to torture of his wife. Later, while granting interim bail to Kumar, the chief judicial magistrate (CJM), Motihari, directed him to surrender in the court. But he did not surrender and a non-bailable warrant of arrest was issued against him by the CJM.

Ram, then posted as Sheohar DSP, allegedly stayed the arrest of Kumar. The high courtâ€™s division bench took this interference seriously and asked the DSP whether the court order was complied with.

On behalf of Ram, it was submitted by his counsel that when his client passed the order, he was not aware of the CJMâ€™s order. The bench pointed out that while filing reply to a show-cause, Ram must have come to know about the CJMâ€™s order. Did he withdraw his order then? the court asked. Ramâ€™s counsel could not give a satisfactory reply.
