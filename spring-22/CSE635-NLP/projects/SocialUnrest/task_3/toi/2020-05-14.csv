0,Row over lecture shortage rules,"JALANDHAR: A peculiar situation has arisen in the law department of GNDU Regional campus here. A war of words has broken out between the teaching authorities and some influential parents.

As many as 10 students of the second semester have not been allowed to give their examination on the ground of lecture shortage. Parents of four students have protested against this. The director and head of department Dr. Daljeet Singh was allegedly assaulted on the campus by one of the parents.

The parents want the rules regarding lecture shortage to be waived. They are asserting it as a matter of right. Talking to TOI Dr Daljit Singh said:

""As per rules, 75% aggregate is necessary for a student to appear before the exam. Therefore, we have disallowed 10 students. Despite repeated warnings these students ignored the lecture shortage rule. Ours is a school of legal studies, the first of its kind in the northern region. In our department, we cover 60% of theory and 40% in practicals.

There are regular seminars, presentations, assignments and project reports which are part of the practical work done by the students. Our department was started in July 2002, and in just 10 months it has managed to arrange for the students to meet the Chief Justice of India, Chief Justice of the Punjab and Haryana High court and other high court judges. Special guest lectures are organised in which the students get an opportunity to gain knowledge. 3 travel agents booked

The local police have arrested a chemist on charges of selling psychotropic drugs without proper prescription. The police recovered vials of norphine injections from the shop of Manish Kochar. Several addicts used to visit his shop regularly. Three travel agents have been booked on charges of cheating youth who wanted to settle abroad. Bahadur Singh and Balkar Singh, residents of Rurka Kalan, were booked on a complaint by Jamuna Bai.

Harjinder Singh, who runs a travel agency, Ms MS Agency on Police Lines road, was booked on a complaint filed by Joginder Kaur while Yograj Singh, resident of Nasarwal, Lohian, has been booked on a complaint filed by Balwinder Kaur.

1,"Gujarat govt borrows, repackages Cong 'date'","AHMEDABAD: Itâ€™s May 21, 2003. At 4.55 pm sharp, NSG commandos enter the Akshardham temple complex.

No this is not the opening shot of a film on Akshardham, but a part of the state governmentâ€™s plans for observing Anti-terrorism Day.

Move over Republic Day, Gaurav Divas and Anti-terrorism Day are now the governmentâ€™s hot-ticket events.

After the much-hyped Gujarat Gaurav Divas celebrations on May 1, the state government is all set for yet another round of rituals to commemorate Anti-terrorism Day on May 21, with the attack on Akshardham symbolising terrorism in the state, which once epitomised peace.

This year on the anniversary of the assassination of former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi, observed as Antiterrorism Day since 1992 throughout the country, the government is taking keen interest in â€œspreading the word about terrorismâ€�. So there will be gram sabhas even in the remote tribal villages of the Dangs, where a television is still a rare sight, to tell the people about the attack on Akshardham â€œand how terrorism is a bad wordâ€�.

Saurashtraâ€™s districts, which are in the grip of a severe drought, will also do their bit, though officials remain divided on whether â€œthe state is more ridden by natural calamities or by terrorismâ€�, as an official in Ahmedabad put it. Surendranagar has already decided to host essay competitions, prabhatpheris, film shows on that day.

Ahmedabad will witness a human chain from the Income Tax Circle to the Sabarmati Ashram, besides a marathon and display of weaponry at the police stadium. The authorities in Vadodara have roped in the ingenuity of the fine arts faculty to drive home the message. Incidentally, a film on the attack on Akshardham, which was premiered in New Delhi, reportedly upset deputy prime minister LK Advani, who represents the Gandhinagar constituency. In Gujarat, newly appointed chief secretary P K Laheri set the ball rolling when he chaired a video conference of home department officials, district collectors, district development officers, municipal commissioners and police chiefs on Monday to chart out the tasks for the event. â€œThe collectorates have been asked to dish out Rs 25,000 from the state coffers for the event, while the rest of the expenses will be met by contributions from industries and business houses,â€� said a senior government official.

The plan is to have Chief Minister Narendra Modi enter the Akshardham precincts (with his NSG commandos) at 4.55 pm, marking the time when the two terrorists barged into the temple on September 24, 2002.

This will be followed by speeches and an oath-taking ceremony.

The idea earlier was to rope in school students, but with the vacation on, NGOs have been asked to pool in with volunteers.

â€œItâ€™s mainly to generate awareness and alert people about any suspicious movement in their locality,â€� adds additional chief secretary (Home) K C Kapoor.

2,Mamata demands CBI probe into rural polls,"KOLKATA: Trinamul Congress chief M a m a t Banerj e on Wednesday demanded CBI inquiry into the ''manipulation'' of the gram panchayat election, which saw the CPM-led ruling Left Front on a winning spree in majority of the seats in the three-tier panchayat bodies.

In support of her contention, she alleged at a press conference that CPM leader Biman Bose had predicted before Sunday''s elections that the left front would secure 73 per cent of seats and the congress would occupy second spot. ""It has happened exactly as he said.

How did he know of this beforehand? Only a CBI inquiry will reveal the truth,"" she said. Asked whether her party would help Congress to form the zilla parishad board Malda district which produced a hung parishad, Banerjee said Congress should first shed their attitude of treating ''Trinamul Congress as untouchable'' due to its alliance with BJP.

Neither the Left nor the Opposition have a majority in Malda. The Congress won 15 seats compared to the CPMâ€™s 14 and one each by the Forward Bloc, CPI, Trinamul and BJP.

WBPCC chief Pranab Mukherjee attributed the success of his party in Murshidabad and Malda zilla parishads to organisational strengh built up by local heavyweight Adhir Chowdhury and former railway minister A.B.A Ghani Khan Chowdhury in the respective districts.

""Congress could not repeat the performance in the remaining districts because organisational failures,"" he said.

3,Vat implementation awaits Union govt clearance,"GANDHINAGAR: State finance minister Vajubhai Vala on Wednesday said that the proposal for Value-added tax (Vat) would be implemented only after it was cleared by the central government.

Vala said that the draft Bill on Vat, prepared by the state government, has been sent to the Union finance ministry and the new system would not be introduced till the Bill was approved by the government. He said that the Union government would have to give assurance to the state to offset the loss on implementation of the new formula.

According to a rough estimate, the state would have to be compensated to the tune of Rs 700 crore, in case Vat is implemented. â€œUnder no circumstances would Vat be implemented without clearance from the Centre,â€� he said.

5,Energy minister hits out at Centre,"PATNA: The state government on Wednesday made a scathing attack on the Centre for meting out â€œstep-motherly treatmentâ€� to Bihar, particularly in the energy sector.

Talking to mediapersons on Wednesday, energy minister Shakeel Ahmad Khan said that the state had demanded a package of Rs 17,755 crore for the energy sector. Out of this amount, the Centre had recommended to provide financial assistance to the tune of Rs 4,420 crore, he added.

â€œTill date, we have not received a single amount,â€� Ahmad said. He also blamed Union ministers, particularly those belonging to Bihar, for not clearing various pending power projects for Bihar.

He said that the government has already signed the tripartite agreement in which it has agreed to issue a bond of Rs 2,600 crore for the one-time settlement of its outstanding dues. The MoU has already been signed by the Bihar government. The cabinet has already approved it, he added.

Only recently, the Bihar State Electricity Board (BSEB) had opened a fresh monthly letter of credit (LC) of Rs 60 crore for making the payment of the consumed energy of the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC), the minister said. The BSEB has also started paying the monthly instalment of Rs 12 crore for NTPCâ€™s dues. In total, the BSEB has been making payment to the tune of Rs 72 crore per month, he said.

The minister admitted that the BSEB has made slow progress in the rural electrification programme in achieving its target in 2002-2003. He hoped that within a couple of months, the BSEB will be able to achieve its target of rural electrification in Bihar. The necessary raw materials to be used in the rural electrification has already been purchased, he said.

He said that Bihar has not been getting adequate amount of coal from Mogma colliery despite assurances from the Union coal ministry. He said it has been agreed upon to send the coal from Mogma colliery but till date it is yet to be supplied, he said.

Bihar will be getting adequate amount of power from Chukkha hydel project in another 15 days in order to meet the increased demand during the summer season, he said.

Junior power minister Shyam Rajak and energy secretary K C Mishra were also present on the occasion.

6,Moles on the wrong side of the law worry officials,"HYDERABAD: Law enforcement agencies often rely on informers — moles — whose tip-offs help them crack cases. But a different set of moles in the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) are reportedly doing the job in the reverse — they are tipping off corrupt officials about impending raids. Senior ACB officials, pleading anonymity, admit that some corrupt'' government officials in fact pay a fixed sum regularly to their moles in the ACB. In the last few months, the ACB failed to trap four officials and also failed in four surprise checks and in a case of disproportionate assets. They blame these on information being leaked by moles. During a surprise check last month at the Shapur checkpost the ACB sleuths could not find anything unusual'' despite waiting for over seven hours. It was the third time that the ACB men failed in their attempt to catch corrupt officials at this spot, a noted place for corruption.'' In Potti Sreeramulu Nellore district, a revenue inspector who was alerted by his mole in the ACB, escaped from landing in the ACB dragnet. Sources said the official was harassing a farmer who had applied for a copy of land records. The farmer was forced to make rounds of the office as he failed to give the bribe demanded by the official. The farmer approached the ACB and a trap was laid. However, the official received the information in advance and sent the land records across to the complainant. When the complainant approached the official with the bribe money, the official refused to accept it and told the farmer that he had sent the land records through the village servant as the applicant had not turned up. In a disproportionate assets case, a motor vehicle inspector fled along with his family after locking his residence in Potti Sreeramulu Nellore town after he received information about the ACB raids. According to the ACB norms, the accused officer has to declare his assets, lest a case cannot be made out easily. Admitting that the ACB had failed in some cases due to leakage of information, ACB director general A K Mohanty said, There is leakage at some stage or the other and steps are being taken to check the trend.''

7,HC notice to govt on vigilance probe,"LUCKNOW: When the government fails, judiciary steps in. In yet another case of exposing Mayawati government''s failure, a Lucknow bench of the Allahabad High Court admitted a PIL seeking CBI probe against 76 bureaucrats, including over two dozen IAS/IPS and PCS, who massed huge wealth.

The division bench, comprising Chief Justice Tarun Chatterjee and Justice NK Mehrotra, passed an order on Wednesday directing the Mayawati government to file counter-affidavit within two weeks and gave one week''s time to the petitioner to file the rejoinder.

Realising the merit and importance of the case, Chief Justice Tarun Chatterjee has tied up the case in his court and ordered for listing it in the third week of July after vacation to argue on its maintainability after hearing the petitioner and opposite parties.

Significantly, the petitioner, Sudhendra Nath Tripathi, has made the chief commissioner, income tax, as opposite party along with the Central and the state governments, besides the secretary and the director, vigilance.

In the PIL No (2529/2003), the petitioner charged the state government with withdrawing as many as 24 vigilance inquiries in the last three years against senior IAS/IPS and PCS officers who were indicted by the state vigilance department for misappropriation of government funds and amassing disproportionate assets in benami in the last one decade.

As per details submitted by the petitioner''s counsel, JS Tomar, in the court, prominent IAS/IPS officers against whom vigilance inquiries were dropped include Akhand Pratap Singh, Alok Jain, Bhupendra Singh, Bhanu Pratap Singh and Prem Chandra.

Interestingly, vigilance probe against Akhand Pratap Singh was ordered on April 6, 2002 but was mysteriously withdrawn by chief minister Mayawati within four months, on July 5, 2002 wide letter No (1602/39-3-3A(7)/99 TC. The officer was posted as APC twice and, ironically, now is heading the vigilance commission.

The petitioner has submitted all relevant GOs and photographs of benami properties amassed by these influential bureaucrats and charged them with non-compliance of GO for disclosure of their properties.

Charging bureaucrats with using their influence, the petitioner also pointed out that as many as 43 vigilance inquiries, including 13 against IAS officers, which were completed have also been dropped at the behest of the chief minister.

The petitioner also rapped the chief commissioner, income tax, for not initiating any inquiry or action against these officers who have constructed palatial houses in posh localities in the state capital. The petitioner claimed that, as a result of corruption in the state bureaucracy, the state government suffered a loss to the tune of a whopping Rs 35,000 crore.

Seeking issuance of mandamus to the Centre and the state governments for recommending CBI probe against these officers, the petitioner has also sought directions to the secretary and director, vigilance and chief commissioner, income tax, to produce records of inquires made by them and action initiated.

8,Dalit politics in Amethi,"LUCKNOW: For days to come, the parliamentary constituency of Congress president Sonia Gandhi is likely to revolve around Dalit politics. Perturbed by the Bahujan Samaj Party''s complete sway over them, major political parties have asked their cadre to take up the cause of Dalits on priority basis, ostensibly to slice away a chunk of their vote bank.

On May 15, former MP of Amethi Sanjay Singh is organising mass wedding for the poor. Of the 51 pairs to be married on Thursday in Amethi, 41 pairs are from Dalit community and the rest are from the OBCs and other castes, said a political worker. Interestingly, a host of senior BJP leaders. including Uttar Pradesh unit chief Vinay Katiyar, have been invited for the marriage ceremony.

Though for Singh the mass marriage ceremony is an annual feature, the preponderance of Dalits has caught the eyes of the local population. It is interesting to know that a month ago, the UPYC had sent a directive to collect information about Dalits whose houses were damaged in fire recently, said a Delhi-based leader of the party.

For the BSP, political parties'' attempt to wean away Dalits would prove to be a blow it cannot afford at a time when Priyanka Gandhi is determined to take challenge thrown at her by chief minister Mayawati.

9,Harassed Kanpur farmers threaten suicide,"KANPUR: Hundreds of farmers in Kanpur and adjoining areas seem to have been caught between the devil and the deep sea. While on the one side are burgeoning loans and crop failures, on the other are teshil revenue collection teams and cops hounding them off from their homes.

Aggrieved, they have now threatened to commit suicide.

The gravity of the situation can be gauged from the fact that about five dozen farmers, who failed to repay loans taken for seed, fertiliser and other purposes, are already lodged in different tehsil jails, including those at Rasoolabad, Hjatampur, Billhuar, Kanpur and Bhognipur. Hundreds of others have gone underground and are spending sleepless nights away from their homes to avoid arrests. The odds have now forced them to consider suicide if the government does not provide them with any immediate relief.

A farmer from Khatharua village, Raju, who is locked in tehsil jail of Kanpur City, told the Times News Network that he had taken a loan of Rs 4,500 to buy a buffalo. However, as he failed to repay the same owing to financial constraints, he was put behind bars. Raju laments: â€œI incurred huge loss due to the drought last year... how can I repay my loan when we donâ€™t even get the production cost of our crops.â€�

Another farmer from Bidhnoo, Wahana, had taken a bank loan of Rs 25,000 about five years back and subsequently failed to repay it. He is now lodged in Kanpur tehsil jail. Wahana told TNN: â€œI was arrested at a time when I had to make arrangements for my daughtersâ€™ marriage. This has tarnished my image in the village and its neighbourhood. I do not know what to do now, kill myself?â€�

Raju and Wahana are no exceptions. There are scores of other farmers who are locked in various tehsil jails of Kanpur City and Kanpur Dehat for similar reasons. Besides, hundreds of defaulting farmers are quitting their villages to escape arrest by recovery teams. Consider the case of Chunna Singh of Bidhnoo, who had taken a loan of Rs 4,000 in 1995 for seeds and failed to repay it. He is now living the life of a vagabond. â€œI have not visited my home for the last one week. I am seeking refuge in a relativeâ€™s house in the city. I am getting regular information that the tehsil team is hunting for me.â€� Chunna informed that though he had taken a loan of Rs 4,000 in 1995, the total debt (including the interest) he has to pay now is Rs 20,000.

Head of Chandra Shekhar Krishi Samiti Anil Kumar Katiyar said that about 15 farmers of Shivrajpur have been arrested this month for nonpayment of dues. He said the government should find a solution to the problem instead of â€œthrowingâ€� farmers behind the bars. Katiyar said: â€œShiv Rajpur lies in the potato belt. The farmers here are incurring huge losses due to low returns on their produce this year. How can you expect them to repay their dues under such circumstances?â€�

However, DM Arvind Kumar had a different tale to tell. â€œThe government had stayed recovery of dues from the farmers only till March this year. Now the administration is free to recover it,â€� he said.

He said there were several thousand defaulting farmers in Kanpur City only. Tehsildar RC Shukla told TNN he had received recovery orders from various banks against defaulting farmers and a â€œmassiveâ€� campaign will be soon launched against them.

However, president of Kisan Kamgar Sammellan KK Shukla urged the government to waive off the dues of the farmers. â€œFramers are being sent to jail. What will happen to their families?â€� he asked adding â€œthe government should waive off loans upto Rs 25,000.â€�

10,Sinha briefs Powell on Indo-Pak developments,"NEW DELHI: Expressing appreciation and understanding of India''s approach to the Indo-Pak dialogue, the US has assured India that it would continue to emphasise to Pakistan the need to take steps on cross border activities.

This assurance was conveyed by US Secretary of State Colin Powell during his meeting with External Affairs Minister Yashwant Sinha in Moscow.

The external affairs spokesperson said that the rationale behind the PM''s initiative - and for adopting a step by step approach - had been conveyed to the US which accepted the validity of the approach.

Sinha impressed on Powell the fact that to ensure that the process of engagement should not be disrupted by terrorist attacks, the end of cross-border terrorism was a practical necessity. The US, it was stated, showed understanding and acceptance of this approach.

The two countries also agreed to remain in touch, especially on the issues of high-tech commerce, civilian uses of nuclear energy and space.

The meeting which took place for about an hour was described as cordial, friendly and relaxed.

11,"Naik rules out MRPL, ONGC merger","MANGALORE: Petroleum Minister Ram Naik on Thursday ruled out merger of Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd (MRPL), with Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), which had recently taken it over, but expressed optimism that it will turnaround in a year''s time.

""With the financial support of ONGC, I can assure that bad days of MRPL are over and the refinery which was already one of the best in technical terms, will soon be one of the most profitable refineries in the country,"" Naik said at function organised here to receive the first shipment of crude oil from Sudan.

Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani was also present at the function.

Ruling out merger of MRPL with ONGC, Naik said ""there is no case for merging MRPL with ONGC. Both will function independently"".

Total revenue is projected to jump to Rs 11,012 crore in 2003-04 as opposed to Rs 8694 crore last fiscal.

MRPL was expected to post cash profits this fiscal and would be in black next year, Naik told reporters here.

12,J&K govt to cooperate with rights panel: Beigh,"SRINAGAR: Jammu and Kashmir government said on Thursday it would fully cooperate with the State Human Rights Commission (SHRC) to investigate the cases of disappearances in the state.

Reacting to the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) directive seeking an explanation from the state government on missing people, State Law and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Muzaffar Hussain Beigh said, ""we will fully cooperate with the SHRC and provide them as many officers as they want to investigate these cases.""

Beigh said he was hopeful that full cooperation from police and government to the SHRC can lead to vital information on many persons who disappeared mysteriously in the state.

Admitting that in the past the SHRC had complained about lack of cooperation from the government in investigating the missing cases, the minister said, ""as per the figures I have collected nearly 4,000 persons are missing in the state since 1989.""

He said it was difficult to say what happened to all of the missing persons but so far it has been established that 140 have died or have been killed.

""It is difficult to say whether those still alive are here or have crossed the Line of Control,"" he added.

""It is my duty as the law minister to see the law of the country is fully obeyed,"" Beigh said responding to NHRC notice and added that making law enforcing agencies accountable was among his duties.

Human rights groups here contest government''s version on missing people and maintain that around 8,000 persons were missing after being taken into custody by security forces.

13,Allow us to fly abroad: Pvt airlines to govt,"MUMBAI: Jet Airways, which inducted the 42nd aircraft in its fleet, has urged government to allow domestic private carriers to fly abroad and also carry out their own ground handling.

""We have urged the government to allow us use the unutilised bilateral air traffic rights and declare us designated carriers ... we can speak with conviction that we will be able to provide better services than even the foreign airlines. Air Sahara has also made a similar appeal,"" Jet chief Naresh Goyal told reporters here.

Asked in which sectors would they be willing to fly, he said ""any sector the government allows us to operate. But that depends solely on them. The British government allows foreign carriers (like Virgin Atlantic) to operate abroad"". He favoured destinations in South, Southeast Asia and the Gulf, but reiterated that it was for the government to decide.

To questions on the government decision to allow only Air India, Indian Airlines and Airports Authority of India to carry out ground handling in all airports in the country, Goyal said the two carriers have also asked the government to allow them do their own ground handling.

""Otherwise, how can we give the product which we promise to the customers. While there should be no compromise on security and safety, we are hopeful the government would understand the practical problems,"" he said.

""The mere fact that there has been no negative response so far makes us feel hopeful. government will take a practical approach to resolve the issue,"" the Jet chief said about ground handling.
