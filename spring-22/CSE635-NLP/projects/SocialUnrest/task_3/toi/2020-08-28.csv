2,Ghaziabad tech college students riot,"GHAZIABAD: Police were called in after students of two prominent engineering colleges in the district who had been suspended for ragging freshers allegedly resorted to rioting.

At Dr K N Modi Institute of Engineering and Technology (KNMIET), police resorted to lathi charge after about a dozen freshers were injured by the rioting seniors. The college has been closed down and the hostel vacated. Institute officials said they dropped the hostel residents at Ghaziabad railway station.

At R K G Institute of Technology (RKGIT), police were called in after 70 seniors, who had been suspended for ragging and vandalism, resisted being sent home. College authorities said they would â€˜â€˜be rusticated if an inquiry confirms the charges against themâ€™â€™. â€˜â€˜We have also fined each of them Rs 1,500 for the damage they have caused,â€™â€™ said faculty member S N Dube.

According to KNMIET administration chief Avinash Sharma, strict steps had been taken to curb ragging this year because of which some senior students were irked.

Sharma said the entire episode was triggered of when some freshers refused to wish the seniors on Wednesday night. An

argument ensued. Later, at about 12 am, the senior students went to the top floor of the hostel where the freshers live.

â€˜â€˜We have very tight security, and the freshersâ€™ section is sealed off with a steel shutter. But these senior students managed to enter and ragged, abused and beat up the juniors. The institute officials rushed to the spot and brought things under control,â€™â€™ he said.

After a while, however, the seniors changed their mind and charged upstairs, said Sharma. They reportedly broke the legs of chairs and attacked the freshers. â€˜â€˜The police had to use their canes to quell rioting,â€™â€™ he added.

About a dozen students were hurt in the incident, however, only two were seriously injured, said Dr Rajinder Trisal of Modi Eye Hospital where the students were treated.

At RKGIT, the seniors had been trying to rag the freshers at night, said Dube. But they could not enter the freshersâ€™ hostel due to the tight security.

â€˜â€˜But at about 4 am on Thursday, about 70 second year students barged into the freshersâ€™ hostel when there was a blackout. They beat up the generator operator and did not allow him to switch on the power standby,â€™â€™ said Dube. They broke the lock on the steel shutter of the hostelâ€™s entrance and smashed furniture and windowpanes. They also ragged the 100-odd freshers and beat them.

â€œRanjit Sharma will continue to be the police commissioner and he will be assisted by joint commissioner crime) Satyapal Singh and additional commissioner Rakesh Maria. I brought in Mr Singh and Mr Maria after the earlier blasts and they have done a good job of investigating them.

5,Principal lodges FIR against students,"DARBHANGA: Some of the third year students of Government Polytechnic, Darbhanga, have taken law into their own hands. They severely assaulted their teacher, lab-in-charge and custodian of examination paper Rajesh Ranjan Das on Tuesday.

About a dozen students approached Das and demanded sessional records, a confidential document submitted by their seniors during the previous session. They had a plan to either copy the document of get it xeroxed and then submit these when they appear for their sessional examination. As they did not attend the practical classes regularly they did not have the faint idea as to how to prepare the records.

When Das refused to oblige them, they started assaulting him with belts and hockey sticks. Das came out of his chamber, but the students followed him and beat him till he fell down and became unconscious. He also got his left leg fractured. Principal Bhagwan Singh lodged an FIR at the University police station in this connection.

6,ECR loses several crores during bandh,"DANAPUR: Frequent bandh calls have put the train movements in all five divisions of the newly created East Central Railway (ECR) completely out of gear causing a huge loss to the railways.

The bandh on Monday in Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal, in Bihar and Jharkhand given by banned Naxalite outfits MCC and PW, cost the railways an estimated loss of about Rs 10 crore to Rs 15 crore alone. According to sources, though the railways suffered incalculable loss due to frequent bandhs in the past, it incurred a whopping loss going in crores on account of burning of an electric locomotive goods train on the Grand Chord (GC) section of the Dhanbad division for about 16 to 20 hours, cancellation of trains and by way of refund of tickets and damage to railway property during the bandh on Monday.

A senior ECR official said repeated attacks on the railway staff by bandh supporters had caused panic among them. As a result, they often shuddered to perform their duty freely on the bandh days, he said, adding that the bandh supporters had made railways a soft target for attack and loot. He said the bandh adversely affects punctuality of long-distance trains.

To normalise traffic movement, at least a week is required, he said, adding that the bandh supporters openly tampered with signalling system to forcibly stop the trains. Another dangerous practice adopted by the bandh supporters at a few places was to remove pandrol clips and fish plates from the tracks, which led to derailment of trains also. â€œThis practice may cause a major mishap,â€� the railway official warned. According to sources, three divisions of the ECR â€” Danapur, Dhanbad and Mughalsarai â€” are most vulnerable to activities of miscreants. These divisions suffered a lot in the past due to poor law and order situation.

In the wake of bandh, anti-social people not only damaged railway tracks by uprooting them, they have also developed a tendency to set the railway property on fire, a railway official said. Danapur DRM P K Goel told TNN that security personnel are on round-the-clock move to thwart any nefarious design of anti-social elements. During the bandh calls, the railways now would take extra security and safety measures in the Danapur division, he said, and added that the railway property, which constitute assets of the country, should not be targeted during the bandh, as this harmed common people most.

7,MIA resents 'unbridled' increase in steel prices,"MOHALI: The Mohali Industries Association (MIA) has expressed its strong resentment against the unbridled increase in steel prices over the last eight months. Due to increase in the prices of steel, which is the basic raw material in almost 95 per cent of Small Scale Industries (SSI) in Mohali, by as much as 50 per cent many units are on the verge of closure.

The MIA has decided to submit a memorandum of demands to the Union minister of steel B K Tripathy at Jalandhar and has warned that if the SSIs'' demands are not met within 10 days they would be forced to take drastic steps.

At a news conference, on Thursday, the MIA members said that the big steel manufacturers have formed a cartel and were increasing the steel prices every 15 days to a month. This has broken the back of SSIs. The manufacturer creates artificial shortage in market and the wholesalers are also resorting to hoarding steel in anticipation of further rise in prices. â€˜â€˜It has become impossible for us to service orders in hand, both domestic and international, because they were booked when the prices of steel were low. This has brought a bad name to Mohali and Punjabbased SSIs. Hundreds of SSIs are being forced to shut down leading to unemployment,"" said Gurmeet Singh, president of MIA.

â€˜â€˜The ancillary units supplying to original equipment manufacturers are also under pressure as the prices are settled on a long term basis and they do not entertain requests for frequent price increase and these SSIs are incurring huge capital erosion,"" said Anurag Aggarwal, the general secretary of the MIA.

Industrialists criticised the government''s policy of subsidising the export of raw steel and providing the same to domestic industry at a high price. â€˜â€˜Our nearest competitor in engineering goods sector is China which is importing raw iron from India at the rate of Rs 12 per kg while we are paying between Rs 21-24 per kg. This has increased the cost of our finished goods and we cannot compete with China in finished goods market,"" said R K Luther, MD Atul Fastners Ltd.

â€˜â€˜Cheap raw steel is available in the international market but government has imposed BIS Standards and anti-dumping duty on the import so even that avenue has been closed and we have been left at the mercy of big manufacturers,"" said Yogesh Sagar, vice-president of MIA.

Mulayam had earlier said he would not submit a list to the governor and demanded a trial of strength on the floor of the House.

Talking to reporters shortly after holding talks with Rashtriya Kranti Party president Kalyan Singh, Mulayam had said he was willing to prove his majority on the floor of the House and was confident about having the requisite numbers.

""We won''t give the governor any list. The governor should respect the will of the people. After all, nobody is celebrating the fall of Mayawati''s government,"" he had said.

Citing past instances when the single largest party had been invited to form government, Kalyan said the SP should be given a chance this time.

Mulayam said barring the BSP and the BJP, all political parties had extended support to him. ""Besides, all the Independents have assured me their support,"" he said.

10,Disinvestment of Jessop formalised,"KOLKATA: The controversial disinvestment process of ailing public sector giant Jessop and Company was finally formalised on Friday with the Centre handing over the 72 per cent shares of the company to Ruia Group, which promised to work for its complete turnaround.

The majority shares of the company was handed over to the Ruia Group, accepted as the strategic partner of the government for revival of the company, according to a statement issued here.

The formal handing of the shares to Ruia Group came after last month''s Supreme Court''s refusal to stay the sale of the engineering giant on an appeal by the Jessop Staff Association challenging an earlier order of the Calcutta High Court.

""I envisage that a complete turnaround of Jessop will be carried out successfully by its skilled and competent employees under the professional managers with defined goals and targets,"" P K Ruia, the chairman of Ruia Group, said in a statement.

The Centre decided to disinvest the majority stake in Jessop in 2002 for its revival as it became sick and was under BIFR.

A consortium of the Ruia Group of companies emerged as the highest bidder with a bid of Rs 18.18 crore and the Centre accepted its bid in February 2003.

The Centre continues to hold 27 per cent stake in Jessop through Bharat Bhari Udyog Nigam Limited, the parent company of Jessop, while about one per cent stake was with the institutions and individuals.

Even after Supreme Court''s July 16 order the Kolkata based Titagarh Industries, one of the original bidders for Jessop, filed a writ before the Calcutta High Court challenging the sale on technical grounds.

11,New system gets govt better revenue,"HYDERABAD: Auctioning of the lease rights of temple lands, a new system introduced by the endowments department had helped the government get better revenue according to the endowments minister, Dandu Sivaramaraju.

Talking to reporters here on Friday, the minister said so far the government was getting Rs 5.12 crore and 67,483 bags of paddy from the farmers who had taken temple land on lease. But the new system of auctioning has helped them net Rs 9.45 crore and 96,744 bags of paddy which amounts to an increase of about 30 percent.

The government, he said was now contemplating extending the system to forest lands and orchids which are under the control of the endowment department. The total land under this category is 60,000 acres and notices would be issued once the department gets clearance from the forest department.

Denying that this system had helped big farmers, the minister said that they had not taken away any land from the small and marginal farmer. If they produce a certificate from the Mandal Revenue officer that they were landless, the government would give them the land at a reasonable rate and collect the amount in four instalments, he added.

12,AP govt favours Austria funds for hydel project,"HYDERABAD: The state government is understood to have shown an inclination to accept the terms and conditions of the loan offer from Austria for the hydel power plants it proposes to set up at Dummugudem and Singareddypalli in Telangana region.

According to major irrigation minister Kadiam Srihari, Austria had offered a loan of Rs 7,981 crore at four percent interest. The chief minister had asked the minister and officials to examine the conditionalities put forward by them as well as their technical abilities to set up the major hydel projects.

After examining the details submitted by Austria government, the department has prepared a feasibility report which would soon be submitted to the chief minister.

Meanwhile, Austria has asked the state government to send a delegation led by the minister for major irrigation for a physical examination of the projects they had taken up.

However, it is not yet clear whether it would be possible for Austria to directly fund the project or whether it will have to be routed via the central government or some corporation in the state. The state government would prefer the latter if direct funding was not possible, the minister said.

13,Minister to sue BSF over 'illegal' arrests,"KOLKATA: State agriculture minister and veteran Forward Bloc leader Kamal Guha on Friday threatened to take the Border Security Force to court while taking a dig at his own Left Front government for â€œreacting rather late in the dayâ€� to the plight of 148 men, women and children, who he said were Indian nationals arrested as Bangladeshis by the BSF.

Expressing his anguish at the lack of initiative taken by the government so far, Guha said, â€œAll 148 were arrested from the New Coochbehar station on August 16 by the BSF on the pretext that they were Bangladeshi nationals. However, after inspection it was revealed that not only were all of them Indian nationals, but that most of them were bona fide voters. Also, all the children either had valid birth certificates or pulse polio vaccination certificates. Despite this, the BSF has forcibly kept all the adults in prison and the children in juvenile homes.â€�

Guha who met chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee during the day said the CM had assured him that immediate steps would be taken to release the prisoners. â€œHe has told the Director General of Police Dinesh Vajpai who in turn has told ADG BSF S.I.S Ahmed to look into the matter urgently. Though rather late in the day, it is good to see the state government finally do something for these poor men and women,â€� Guha said.

Most of the arrested, were on their way to Haryana and Rajasthan where they worked as daily labourers. Reading out from a list, Guha said â€œthere are 49 adult males and 37 women among the arrested, among whom 38 men and 28 women are bona fide voters. There are 62 children too, among those detained by the BSF illegally,â€� he said.

Claiming that the BSF was regularly harassing genuine Indian nationals and arresting them as Bangladeshis, Guha said, â€œDespite having documents to prove their innocence these people were picked up and that too from an area which is outside the BSF jurisdiction. Moreover, the BSF officers in question did not even bother to inform the DM or SP of Coochbehar before arresting these poor labourersâ€�.

An angry Guha later said, â€œI have spoken to the CM in the matter and he is angry at the BSF too. I will not let this case go so easily. I will take the BSF to court.â€�

15,Major battles left for ministers to fight in Cancun,"NEW DELHI: As trade envoys of WTO member-countries in Geneva headed home winding up their discussions on Friday, it appeared that the Cancun meeting of 146 trade ministers in a fortnight''s time could be be less about agreements and more about disagreements.

It is likely that in Cancun, the trade ministers will have to graple with differences on a wide range of issues that their representatives have left unresolved.

Trade diplomats said very little is expected to be accompliced in the remaining few days before Cancun by way of ironing out the sharp differences that have marked the talks to open up world trade in agriculture, services and industrial goods.

Nothing perhaps brought this out more laudly than the eleventh hour stalling of an accord on Friday on the highly emotional and humanitarian issue of access of the poor to medicines.

Even though the deal to override the patent regime for public health purposes was through the WTO''s intellectual property council, representing all its member-states, on Thursday, it got stalled in the world trade watchdog''s ruling General Council on Friday because of what officials said an ""interpretation problem"".

Some developing countries interpreted the text of the agreement differently from other countries.

An attempt could still be made to salvage the crucial deal, which was looked upon as a major ""mood booster"" for the Cancun meeting because of its humanitarian angle, but trade diplomats see little chance of a breakthrough.

In any case the inordinate delay in delivering on this as well as on other developmental promises made by the trade ministers in Doha in November 2001 may have already muddied the atmosphere.

On the reform of the agriculture trade, considered as a ""make or break"" issue for the whole round of WTO trade negotiations, the differences among rich and poor countries and among agricultural exporting states and those industrialised countries which protect their farms through subsidies and high tariffs have remained unmitigated despite two attempts at ""compromise text"" on a blueprint for lowering export subsidies, market-distorting domestic support to farmers and import tariffs.

A covering letter, bringing out both the US-EU proposal in agriculture and the counter-proposal tabled by 20 countries led by India, China and Brazil, will be transmitted to the Cancun meeting of trade ministers along with the ""compromise text"" suggested by the chairman of WTO general council, a top Indian negotiator, additional secretary S N Menon said on Friday.

Similarly, in another crucial area, known as Singapore issues, involving the EU-Japan-led attempt to create global rules under WTO covering foreign investment, competition policy, trade facilitation and transparency in government procurement, major battles remain to be fought in Cancun.

The large number of developing countries have been against the bid to build global rules in areas of domestic development policies and during the Geneva discussions in specified working groups on each of the four subjects, no clarity has emerged.

Top Indian trade negotiators made it clear on Friday that India would oppose tooth and nail any attempt in Cancun to mandate negotiations on the Singapore issues even at the risk of isolation.

In their last meeing in Doha, the trade ministers had agreed that a decision on starting negotiation on making global rules in the four areas would be taken at their next session (that is at Cancun) on the basis of ""explicit consensus"".

Indian officials said the phrase ""explicit consensus"" meant any one of the 146 member-states of WTO can veto the negotiations form proceeding in these four areas and India would fully exercise its right in this regard.

16,Water Board to increase daily water supply,"HYDERABAD: The Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply & Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB) will increase daily supplies to 138 million gallons per day (MGD) from August 31 against the present supply of 120 MGD.

This was in view of the satisfactory inflows to Osmansagar, Himayatsagar, Singur and Manjira reservoirs, municipal administration and urban development minister B V Mohan Reddy told reporters on Friday. He said the total availability of water from the three reservoirs is 24.186 thousand million cubic feet on August 28, as against 19.027 TMCft of water last year.

Apart from the present supply of 120 MGD of water, about 18 MGD of water including 9 MGD each from Osmansagar and Himayatsagar will be obtained on a trial basis. Due to the incessant rains in the catchment area during the last one week, the total water storage capacity has increased in all these four reservoirs by 14.3 TMCft, HMWS&SB managing director M G Gopal said.

In addition to the piped water supply, about 25 MGD of underground water is also being used by consumers in the areas served by HMWS&SB.

Despite the increase in supply, the board will continue water supply through mobile water tankers and drill additional borewells as and when required, he said.

17,Govt bends rules for Sachin's car,"MUMBAI: The hearing in the public interest litigation (PIL) against the customs duty waiver on Sachin Tendulkar''s Ferrari has revealed how the Centre bent over backwards to please him. The central government amended the Customs Act which enabled it to accede to the cricketer''s request.

The replies filed by the Centre in response to the PIL by city advocate VM Bharadwaj establish the sequence of events leading to the exemption of Rs 1.13-crore duty on the car.

The government''s affidavit submitted by additional solicitor general of India SB Jaisinghani last week disclosed the finance minister''s views on the issue. Sachin said that the car was an award from Formula One champion Michael Schumacher on July 8, 2002 for having equalled Don Bradman''s record of 29 centuries and hence he had sought exemption.

Tendulkar wrote to finance minister Jaswant Singh on July 27, 2002, seeking a waiver. A little over a month later, the ministry issued an exemption order under the Customs Act. Tendulkar received a personal reply from Singh. The batsman had also sent a copy of his application to BJP MP Pramod Mahajan.

But on realising, perhaps on legal advice, that the cricketer''s request was not covered under the Customs Act, the ministry pushed through an amendment,which allowed it to pass ad hoc orders to exempt duty on any goods in public interest under ""exceptional circumstances"".

The amended Act came into effect on May 14, 2003. Earlier, only goods of strategic or secret nature or meant for charitable purposes were allowed such exemptions.

In his reply to Tendulkar, the finance minister on September 4, 2002, wrote he was ""glad to inform""that he had given instructions to enable the cricketer to import the car duty free.

Singh was however told by his officers that the duty exemption sought is only meant for a prize that is announced for the winner before the start of a sports tournament. Tendulkar''s request did not fall within this provision, the finance minister was told. However, he disagreed with this contention and reasoned that the ""objections""were ""not relevant"".

He said, ""There was no championship, but equalling Sir Don Bradman''s record of 29 centuries is landmark achievement. The spirit of the exemption notification is that the prize should reflect a landmark achievement...The duty exemption may therefore be granted.""

Based on the minister''s views, the Mumbai customs commissioner was directed to grant an exemption.

19,Medha now acquires a political colour,"NEW DELHI: Medha Patkar of the Narmada Bachao Andolan has taken another route in the fight to secure justice for the inhabitants of the Narmada Valley â€” direct political intervention under the umbrella organisation of the National Alliance of Peoplesâ€™ Movement (NAPM).

The NAPM and Jana Sangharsh Morcha on Thursday released a national agenda â€” the Ayodhya Declaration â€” which they said would be sent to various political parties. Based on their reaction to this agenda, the groups will lend their support to the candidates of these parties.

The NAPM represents over 150 organisations across the country, including those of fishworkers, farmers and adivasis. The Ayodhya Declaration outlines NAPMâ€™s main goals as fighting globalisation and communalisation. The NAPM sees them as two sides of the same coin.

20,SC notice to Maya on MLA's arrest,"NEW DELHI: Former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mayawati, who is expected to be questioned by the CBI in the Taj heritage corridor scam case, suffered a jolt on Friday when the Supreme Court issued notice to her on a legislatorâ€™s petition alleging malafide in detaining him under the National Security Act (NSA).

Ateek Ahmad, five-time MLA from Allahabad who has set up a political party called the Apna Dal, moved the apex court saying Mayawati had also got 88 FIRs filed against him in one day. Ahmad claimed that he earned Mayawatiâ€™s wrath as he refused to support her in the assembly. She managed to wean away two Apna Dal MLAs to the BSP fold and also inducted them in her jumbo ministry.

On the plea of Ahmadâ€™s counsel R K Jain and Manoj Goel that Mayawati had virtually played with the petitionerâ€™s life and liberty and thus violated his fundamental right to life, the court issued notice to her.

A Bench of Justice M B Shah and Brijesh Kumar also issued notices to the state government and its police administration which executed the detention order against Ahmad. On being told by Jain that a petition challenging Ahmadâ€™s detention was pending for long before the Allahabad High Court, the Bench urged the high court to dispose it of within three months.

Ahmad, a supporter of Samajwadi Party chief and chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav, suffered four NSA detentions ordered by Mayawati. Two detention orders were set aside by the advisory board.

Seeking exemplary damages and punishment for Mayawati and others, counsel said that the Mayawati government had even conspired to eliminate him through an encounter. When he was attacked, the police registered a case of murder against him.

As for another petition filed by the Ahmad, the apex court, however, asked counsel to argue before the Allahabad High Court on a CBI inquiry into nine cases registered against him. When asked about the effect of the notice on Mayawati who was not heading the government now, counsel said because Ahmad had charged her with â€˜â€˜mala fideâ€™â€™, she alone would be liable to rebut the serious allegation.

Even if the Mulayam government revoked NSA and set him free, Ahmad would still be entitled to seek exemplary damages and stringent punishment for the erstwhile CM, counsel Goel explained.

21,Cong is yet to come clear on joining govt,"NEW DELHI: Despite a prolonged meeting of the Congress Working Committee on Thursday night, the party on Friday gave the impression of being undecided about joining the Mulayam Singh Yadav government in Uttar Pradesh.

â€˜â€˜We are yet to make up our mind,â€™â€™ party spokesman S Jaipal Reddy told reporters. He was non-committal on an entire range of issues emanating from the Congressâ€™ support to Yadav. However, the party has its internal compulsions to contend with. There is no denying the conflicting views within the party on whether to go the whole hog with him. There is also no denying the fact that the Congress has been out of power in the state for long and some of its MLAs would like to get the ministerial chairs.

One key factor is that the Congress is widely perceived as being ready to talk to the BSP to improve its poll prospects in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. Now that the Mayawati government is out and the Congress has opted to support Yadav, these moves get complicated. A sure precondition that Mayawati would place before the Congress is to withdraw support, just extended, to Yadav.

However, Reddy emphatically denied that the party was talking to Mayawati. â€˜â€˜There is no talk of any alliance. I make it very clear,â€™â€™ he said, adding: â€˜â€˜The BSP-BJP coalition was antagonistic, but a Congress-Samajwadi Party relationship is not antagonistic.â€™â€™ Another factor that the Congress has to contend with is the role of Kalyan Singh and his party. Last week, Reddy had talked of the Congressâ€™ â€˜â€˜reservationsâ€™â€™ about Singh, under whose chief ministership the Babri Masjid had been demolished. On Friday, he dismissed the Kalyan Singh issue as â€˜â€˜a minor oneâ€™â€™.

Reddy said the Congress was â€˜â€˜confidentâ€™â€™ that Yadav would not compromise on issues meant to strengthen secularism, in particular the Ayodhya issue. The party was also sure of the Mulayam governmentâ€™s forthright role against the efforts to let off Deputy PM L K Advani, HRD minister Murli Manohar Joshi and Sangh Parivar activists for their alleged role in the demolition of the Babri Masjid.

As Reddy put it, the Congress was â€˜â€˜not imposing any preconditionsâ€™â€™ on Yadav to whom the support was â€˜â€˜political and ideologicalâ€™â€™. Also, Yadav did not need Congress prompting, he said. As for the issue of joining the government or not, the Congress has two weeks to watch the situation. It may also like to see the pattern of support that Yadav would get to prove majority support in the assembly.

22,Farmers ignoring govt’s advice,"CHABHAL, Amritsar: The governmentâ€™s repeated exhortation to farmers to come out of the â€˜wheat-paddy cycleâ€™ and to sow the crops at a time so that their harvesting and arrival in the grain markets coincides with the governmentâ€™s purchase announcement appears to have fallen on deaf ears.

The farmers continue to defiantly sow early paddy and later blame the government for not purchasing the crop in time. They never miss a chance to rail at minimum support price (MSP) announced by it. They also allege their exploitation at the hands of commission agents.

In Amritsar district, the paddy crop has started arriving in the grain markets even as the government is yet to announce its purchase date which is likely to begin from the end of September.

The farmers are being forced to sell their crops at much below the MSP,which is fixed at Rs 580 for Grade I and Rs 550 for coarse variety.

Speaking to TNN, Harjit Singh of Kahangarh village said that that the farmerssow early paddy so that they could also take vegetable crops on baord.

Kabul Singh, a farmer of Chabhal village, alleged that a few commission agents in connivance with rice sheller owners were exploiting the farmers and were buying paddy at around Rs 400 a quintal.

Suchha Singh, a farmer, said that the MSP should have been Rs 650 due to immense expenses incurred on fertilisers, pesticides and labour.

Ajit Singh, district food and civil supplies officer, said that it might take another two weeks or so before the governmentâ€™s purchase of paddy begins. Ajit said that farmers shouldnâ€™t ignore expertsâ€™ advice of not sowing early paddy.

At present, the paddy arriving in the grain markets has too much moisture content but still they were getting around Rs 500 per quintal as the purchase depends on demand and supply, said he.

Meanwhile, more than one thousand farmers from the three border distircts of Amritsar, Gurdaspur and Ferozpur representing six farmersâ€™ associations held a gathering at Amritsar in support of their demands and register resentment against the alleged â€˜â€˜anti-farmersâ€™ policiesâ€™â€™ of the state and central governments.

They also submitted a memorandum of their demands to deputy commissioner. Pishora Singh, president, BKU,Kulwant Singh Sandhu, general secretary, Jamhuri Kisan Sabha, Hardev Singh Sandhu, president, Kirti Kisan Union and others addressed the gathering.
