3,Industry bye-laws: Vertical expansion has no takers,"chandigarh:the industry bye-laws have been amended. and not a single city industrial unit has come forward to seek permission from the chandigarh administration for construction of upper floors on their industrial sheds. and sources in the ut administration only confirmed this. the administration had amended bye-laws governing industrial units to make provisions for construction of additional floors. since there is no land available in the ut for further industrial expansion, the administration, with a view of vertical expansion had allowed construction of additional floors. ut administrator jfr jacob lamented the fact that no industrial unit had opted for vertical expansion. this was pointed out to a delegation of industrial leaders, who called on the administrator, here, last week. industrial sources, requesting anonymity, said that the lack of interest could be attributed to the fact that many of the industrial units, whose manufacturing, assembling units and offices were in the industrial area phase i and ii, had already constructed structures to suit their needs.these violations, reports say, are beyond the purview of the amended bye-laws. the industrial area phase i and ii are spread over an area of 1,480 acres.the administration had also made it clear that no land was available for industrial expansion. there are nearly 2,200 industrial plots and sheds in the city. however, there is only one large scale industrial unit here, and 14 medium scale units. over 2,950 small scale industries (ssi) are registered with the ut. in some cases, more than one ssi unit operates from the same industrial shed. fear, among the industrialists, of making the violations known, might also be the cause of the poor response. reports say, that in both phases of the industrial areas floors have already been constructed in contravention of the earlier bye-laws. an industrialist claimed that a number of people running units or offices in the industrial areas had taken the premises on rent.â€˜â€˜most of the owners are against changing the earlier structure. in other cases, the owners are not living in the city and have little interest in obtaining permission from the authorities,â€™â€™ he added.

14,History all set to repeat for cotton farmers,"warangal:an additional coverage to the extent of one lakh hectares of cotton crop in warangal district is likely to trigger yet another crisis in the farm sector in the coming days as the current dry spell shows no sign of relenting. farmers in almost all the 50 revenue mandals of the district, who have sown cotton despite instructions to the contrary from the administration and agricultural department, are now expressing fears over their survival as the production is bound to be less in the wake of the current unhelpful conditions. in parakal and chityal areas in particular the situation has worsened during the current season. this is the place where a majority of the suicides have occurred during the last decade. though the land under cotton cultivation has minimised in the subsequent years, parakal sub-division occupied the prime place in the total land under cotton cultivation in the district. farmers in the region still feel that commercial crop rather than traditional crops like paddy, pulses and other food grains, would provide them relief, said bollu sammi reddy of urugonda village. his opinion notwithstanding, the area under food grain cultivation has reduced this year by almost twenty per cent to the average coverage in warangal district and all this has been due to delayed monsoon and frequent dry spell in the region. the present dry spell coupled with the continuing problem of pests has increased the plight of the cotton farmers in the region. almost all the farmers have been administering heavy doses of insecticides and pesticides, which, however, has had little effect in controlling the menace from these pests. moreover, frequent power cuts are adding to their woes and nonavailability of irrigation facility is also affecting them. the symptoms of another crisis is looming large over the farmers in the entire north telangana region this year, particularly after the recent power crisis. though the northern power distribution company has been assuring nine hours of power supply to the farm sector, farmers say that it has failed to fulfil its promises in many parts. the effects of the power crisis is evident in narmetta mandal in particular. e malla reddy of potharam village in narmetta mandal pointed out that his area is still not getting the six hours of power supply after about ten days from the day of the failure of the southern power grid. villages in and around narmetta, cherial and bachannapet mandal, perennial drought zones of north telangana, are witnessing this situation and the farmers said that the symptoms of a crisis in the farm sector have already reached alarming levels in this segment. the farmers said that unless drastic steps are taken to address the plight of the hapless cotton farmers they will be faced with no means to support themselves. the farmers hoped government would do something to ease their burden.

16,Water Board to revive incentives to staff,"hyderabad: with a major portion of its rs 90 crore dues yet to be recovered, the hyderabad metropolitan water supply and sewerage board (hmws&sb) plans to revive the incentive scheme to woo its staff to collect the uncollected dues. earlier when incentives were offered an amount of rs 2 crore was collected by the staff. however, the scheme was withdrawn as the field staff reportedly went after collecting dues neglecting their routine maintenance work. the incentives are now being offered again to the staff as the board's financial position is in a bad shape. at a recent meeting of the water board, official reportedly sought revival of the incentive scheme. the board had threatened to invoke the provisions of the revenue recovery act, which provides for confiscation of properties if the dues are not paid. however, this was not resorted to anticipating opposition from the general public. later, the officials proposed disconnecting sewer and drinking water supply lines as aptransco had done disconnecting power supply if dues were not paid. even this plan was shot down. the water board is due to get over rs 50 crore from domestic consumers and a similar amount from commercial consumers and government departments. however,water board officials say collecting dues from government departments was not a problem, but it was tough collecting dues from domestic consumers. not many people responded when the board offered instalment provision to consumers who owe huge sums to the hmws&sb.

18,BJP rules out leadership change in Gujarat,"ahmedabad: the ruling bjp in gujarat on wednesday said there was no question of replacing keshubhai patel as chief minister following poor performance by the party, that suffered serious drubbing by congress in the recent by-elections in the state. gujarat unit bjp general secretary gordhanbhai zadhapia told pti that there was no alternative to patel in the state and it was under his leadership that the party got a thumping majority in the 1998 assembly elections. voices of dissent became prominent following bjp's embarrassing drubbing in sabarkantha lok sabha and sabarmati assembly bypoll last week and the speculation about the change in leadership was rife as patel was summoned to new delhi by party high command on tuesday. patel is scheduled to meet prime minister a b vajpayee, home minister l k advani and party president jana krishnamurthy on wednesday. ""by-election results cannot be a reflection of the performance of the state government or for that matter any government,"" he said, adding that in gujarat, there was the least chance of the result having any impact on the leadership. ""by-polls are not general elections. the fact that bjp lost the seats to congress does not mean that it's a vote against the performance of the patel ministry. one should not forget that the margin of victories in both the seats were not big. and bjp polled more votes in many assembly segments of sabarkantha parliamentary constituency, a congress stronghold, and to us it was an achievement,"" he added.

""there is a need to incorporate in an unequivocal manner a condemnation of trans-border terorism or the tendency of countries to engage in proxy war, encouraging, supplying and training terrorists while claiming to be champion of freedom and democracy,"" sharma said. khan said india has also proposed in the conference that a mechanism can be devised by which information on terrorism is passed on to the interpol secretariat in a timely manner and is collated and analysed and passed on to the countries requiring the data, and who were in the frontline in the fight against terrorism. khan said so far nearly 170 requests from india were pending with several countries for extradition of criminals out of which nearly three dozen cases were related to terrorist crimes. sharma said terrorism of any sort has to be condemned wherever and however, it takes place. ""this is necessary because when we talk of global terrorism, we cannot ignore it and if we do so, we do so at our own peril. ""hence, this general assembly must unequivocally condemn acts of terrorism such as they have been reported anywhere in the world as a challenge to forces of peace and order all over the world,"" he said. the cbi spokesman said there was a general impression among the member countries for the need to launch a pro-active global strategy to combat terrorism. the international community will have to build a consensus among nations and provide a platform to facilitate and strengthen the mechanism to deal with terrorism at international level, khan said. ""this can be done by aligning effectively and timely sharing of information,"" the cbi director said. when asked whether the cbi director raised the issue of extradition of five hijackers and two of their accomplices from pakistan, khan said ""this is only a part of an issue and could be raised at bilateral level also. here the issue is of terrorism in totality and threats posed by it to the civilised world."" he said maximum of the terrorist wanted in connection with the crimes in the country were either hiding in pakistan or in afghanistan. ""the issue with pakstan has been raised time and again but the issue of terrorists hiding in afghanistan still remains as the interpol does not recognise the taliban administration,"" khan added.

21,2 Congress men suspended for anti-party activities,"ahmedabad: soon after the election wins, trouble has begun to brew in the gujarat congress with all-india congress committee member irshadbaig mirza alleging that gujarat pradesh congress committee amarsinh chaudhary was ""out to ruin his career"". in the city, two congress workers , vishnu patel and op sharma, from sabarmati, have been suspended from the party for anti-party activities. mirza was reacting to chaudhary's statement in an interview accusing mirza of foisting candidates from the minorities in the sabarkantha parliamentary constituency to divide the votebank in the by-polls that concluded recently. chaudhary had also stated that he would bring mirza's dissidence before the congress high command, which seems to have put the aicc leader on a sticky wicket. when contacted on wednesday evening, chaudhary completely denied the report and told tnn, ""i have never made such allegations; it is totally baseless"". he, however confirmed that he had suspended patel and sharma for anti-campaigns in the sabarmati assembly constituency. incidentally, three independent candidates from the minority group cornered at least 43,000 votes in sabarkantha which the party believes are of the minorities and might have given a bigger margin to the congress. this has led the party to do a lot of introspection. mirza stated that he had campaigned for the party in all possible segments of sabarkantha and had no hand in diverting minority votes. meanwhile, the changing political scenario in the state is expected to have the congress buy more time on appointing the congress legislature party leader, say sources. with rumours that the bjp high command might have a change of guard, the congress high command, which was to announce the clp leader for gujarat soon, may wait a while. now that narhari amin is in the state assembly, there are possibilities that he might take over the clp mantle from chaudhary.
