0,"Diversify, reduce costs, PM tells farmers","NEW DELHI: Listing what his government has done for farmers, promising to look after their interests and get them the right price for their produce, Prime Minister Vajpayee on Sunday asked farmers to diversify, reduce costs and ready for global competition.

Addressing farmers who had gathered at his residence to felicitate him for recent announcements such as the reduction in interest rate on crop loans, the PM made one more announcement: the interest rate on agricultural loans upto Rs 2 lakh should not be more than the prime lending rate (PLR). This, he said, should work out to a total benefit of Rs 2,500 crore.

As cabinet ministers Rajnath Singh, Sahib Singh and Sharad Yadav looked on, the PM welcomed farmers brought by the BJP Kisan Morcha to his kiraye ka makaan (rented house)"" amid lyrical mention of the weather but drove home the lesson on what needs to be done, peppering it all with what his government has done so far.

Many countries in the world need grain for their poor but our costs are much higher than international prices. We need to bridge this gap and lower costs, went his appeal.Recommending the formation of monitoring committees to ensure farmers benefit from the lower interest rate regime, he urged them to go in for credit cards on a bigger scale. More than three crore farmers already have such cards.

Describing farmers as a priority for the government, Vajpayee asked them to change their farming styles, diversify into horticulture, grow pulses and oilseeds the country still needs and dwelt on the problems of storage and distribution.

There is, globally, a demand for flowers, he pointed out. And, if we can ensure quality and get these to the market, and out of the country, fast enough, we could benefit, he said. This is why, he said, his government was focusing on roads.

Dwelling on grain production, he said there is more than enough grain so there should be no reason for complaints that it is not reaching everybody. Yet it doesn''t, he said, asking farmers to inculcate the habit of saving each grain, just as the effort is to save each drop of water.

1,Palestinian foreign minister to be in Delhi before Israeli PM,"NEW DELHI: India''s tightrope walk in West Asia will once again be evident in the next few days, with the red carpet being rolled out for the visits by Palestine National Authority''s foreign minister Nabil Sha''ath and Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon.

The government''s balancing act between its traditional Arab ally Palestine and relatively new friend Israel will kick off on Friday when Sha''ath begins his three-day visit to India. Sharon, in turn, is likely to be here from September 9 to 11. Incidentally, the visits come at a time when relations between Israel and the Palestinian authority are at their worst in recent times.

``Sharon''s visit will signify the maturing of our policy of finding the right kind of balance in our policy for West Asia. The relations with Israel, particularly in defence, have expanded in the last few years...it''s a handicap to have an equation with only one side (Palestine),'''' said a senior external affairs ministry official.

Formally announcing Sha''ath''s visit, the ministry spokesperson said, ``India has consistently supported the Palestinian cause. This long-standing position has roots in India''s traditional ties with the Arab world.''''

He added: ``India''s commitment to contribute to peace and stability in this region is a cardinal element of our foreign policy.'''' As part of a broader traditional engagement with Palestine, thousands of its students have studied in India and there are extensive people-to-people contacts.

``India has also assisted the Palestinian National Authority in upgrading its human resource and nation-building capacities,'''' said the spokesperson.

Sha''ath, who heads a three-member delegation, however, will be hosted in India by minister of state Vinod Khanna since the senior minister, Yashwant Sinha, is away on a visit to Singapore, Australia and Indonesia.

``Sha''ath''s visit comes in response to a January 2003 invitation by the external affairs minister...he will hold discussions with the Indian leadership on issues of bilateral, regional and global interest,'''' said the spokesperson.

2,2 principals of LNMU fight,"DARBHANGA: The infighting between the principals of LNMU for plum posting had been a regular feature on the campus, but this time it has gone to the extent of challenging the appointment of a senior LNMU teacher K P Yadav as principal by his junior Kameshwar Jha.

Yadav is presently the principal of CM college, Darbhanga, while Jha is the principal of Marwari college, Darbhanga.

The echo of the fight between the two has also reached the Raj Bhavan which recently directed the LNMU authorities concerned that the chancellor would make a hearing of this case on November 1 and both the parties (Jha and Yadav) and the university administration should remain present on that date.

Earlier, Jha had made several representations to the VC and chancellor in this regard. Yadav had also sent rejoinders. The history of the appointment of Yadav as principal is also interesting.

Yadav had to move to the high court in this regard. Later, HC referred the case to the chancellor, which, in turn, directed the university to consider his case for appointment.

Jha had challenged Yadav''s appointment on the ground that his (Yadav''s) name was recommended for J K College principal, Biroul, in 1980 by the Bihar University Service Commission, but the governing body of the college, which was then an affiliated unit, rejected his appointment.

Later the university appointed Yadav for another college for which his name was not recommended. Jha had said that the decision of the university was illegal.

However, Yadav had mentioned that his appointment was made by LNMU syndicate on the directive of the then chancellor in 1982.

Since 1982, Yadav had been working as a ""bonafide"" principal in various colleges.

3,5 miners hurt in freak incident,"DHANBAD: Five colliery workers were injured when the lift they were boarding to come above the surface banged against the surface from a height of about 12 ft. at Hurriladih colliery under area eight of BCCL on Wednesday morning.

While three workers have been admitted to BCCL''s Central Hospital at Dhanbad, two others with minor injuries have been admitted to Kustore area hospital.

According to K B L Gupta, agent of Hurriladih colliery who was present at the Central Hospital, five miners of pit one of the colliery had taken the lift at about 9 am to come above the surface, but the lift instead of going up came down from a height of about 12 ft and hit the surface with a thud.

As the lift fell down with speed, the miners present in the lift sustained injuries.

While pump operators Hemant Mahto and Fatick Das and switchman Triveni Ram have been admitted with multiple fractures and head injuries, hookman Manglu Harijan and general mazdoor Madan Bhuian have been admitted to Kustore area hospital.

All injured workers were said to be out of danger by the attending doctors.

Colliery agent Gupta claimed that brake failure caused the accident but he failed to give any satisfactory reply to the question why the brakes of such a vital equipment of the colliery failed.

When asked, the injured workers admitted to the Central Hospital alleged that the lift was malfunctioning for the last six months and several complaints were lodged with the management of the colliery to repair the fault.

Colliery agent Gupta, however, refuted the allegations and said that he had not received any such complaints.

4,Mulayam invited to form govt in UP,"LUCKNOW: A day of hectic political activity culminated in governor Vishnu Kant Shastri inviting Samajwadi Party president Mulayam Singh Yadav to form the next government in Uttar Pradesh late on Wednesday night.

Mulayam will be administered the oath of office at 3 pm on Thursday.

The SP leader had met the governor in the evening and claimed to have the support of 210 MLAs. He, however, submitted the list of only 142 MLAs belonging to his party. All other parties and Independents submitted their own letters of support.

Among those who pledged support to Mulayam were 12 BSP legislators, including two former ministers Jaiveer Singh and Yogesh Pratap Singh.

The 16-member Congress also declared that it would back the SP on the floor of the House. UPCC President Jagdambika Pal and Congress Legislature Party leader Pramod Tiwari met Shastri and handed over a letter extending support to Mulayam.

Mulayam had earlier said he would not submit a list to the governor and demanded a trial of strength on the floor of the House.

Talking to reporters shortly after holding talks with Rashtriya Kranti Party (RKP) president Kalyan Singh, Mulayam had said he was willing to prove his majority on the floor of the House and was confident about having the requisite numbers.

â€˜â€˜We wonâ€™t give the governor any list. The governor should respect the will of the people. After all, nobody is celebrating the fall of Maya-watiâ€™s government,â€™â€™ he said.

Citing past instances when the single largest party had been invited to form government, Kalyan said the SP should be given a chance this time. Mulayam said barring the BSP and the BJP, all political parties had extended support to him. â€˜â€˜Besides, all the Independents have assured me their support,â€™â€™ he said.

5,Outlaws in race to become law-makers,"LUCKNOW: Criminals extended their support from different jails and an absconder in police records accompanied rebel BSP MLAs to Raj Bhawan.

The lone remaining MLA of Akhil Bharatiya Congress Party (ABCD), Akhilesh Kumar Singh, who has been declared absconder by the police, was seen brazenly roaming in the Raj Bhawan, shaking hands with district officials and independents and MLAs from the BSP camp.

It happens only in Uttar Pradesh. With the change in power, an absconder becomes a free man and criminals lodged in jails are assured of fresh air. They seem to carry no caste or party affiliation. For them, the only political goal is siding with power â€” to continue with their underworld empire. Till two days ago, they were supporting the BJP-BSP government, led by Mayawati. But their loyalty changes with the change of power.

Those who changed their loyalty within 48 hours include Mokhtar Ansari and Vijay Singh too. An independent MLA from Farrukhabad, Vijay Singh, who has been recently convicted in Brahma Dutt Dwivedi murder case and is out on bail, had led a pack of seven independents when the coalition government was in crisis just on the first day of brief session on February 28 last. He had submitted a letter of support, signed by six other MLAs, to the assembly speaker Keshari Nath Tripathi pledging support to the Maywati government.

Singh and another independent MLA from Mau, Mokhtar Ansari, a TADA convict, had again issued a letter when Mayawati was on a foreign trip and opposition parties had made an abortive attempt to pull down her government. Others who extended support to Mulayam Singh Yadav include Pota-convict Raghuraj Pratap Singh, an independent from Kunda, who is currently lodged in Kanpur district jail and Dhananjay Singh, who is facing many criminal case and is also lodged in jail.

Not lagging behind, the UP Loktanrik Congress Party leader and a former minister in Mayawati government and his ministerial colleague Shyam Sunder Sharma also rushed to Raj Bhawan to take the opportunity of extending support to the new leader. Gorakhpur-based Hari Shanker Tiwari, whose name still send chills in eastern UP, has also extended his support.

Lokayukta-indicted Raja Ram Pandey, who had missed the bus in the Mayawati government, did not waste time to try his luck in the new emerging formation. And the lone Apna Dal MLA Ateeq Ahmad, a listed gangster, too joined him to complete the chorus.

""They are not criminals when they support BJP or BSP. When they can support other governments and even get ministerial berths then why not the new government under Mulayam Singh Yadavji,"" quips a senior SP leader.

8,Biotechnology to help sugarcane farmers,"PUNE: Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Sharad Pawar on Thursday called for disease resistant varieties of sugarcane to help meet the crisis confronting sugar industry in the state.

Pawar was inaugurating a two day international seminar on sugar-cane genomics and genetic transformation organised by the Vasantdada Sugar Institute (VSI) in association with union ministry of food and public distribution and department of biotechnology.

Addressing the gathering, he pointed out that the sugar industry was reeling under piling of sugar stocks, reduction in sugar and sugarcane prices, biotic stresses encountering sugarcane production and credit crunch. ""Recently a new sugarcane pest called the white woolly sugarcane aphide has been creating havoc in Maharashtra and Karnatak and full control of the pest was still not in sight"", Pawar observed. He urged biotechnologists to come to the assistance of farmers by offering disease resistant varieties of sugarcane.

He said that to be competitive at the world level, sugarcane productivity has to be increased substantially, cost of production has to reduce and value addition has to be made to sugar and by-products.

Pawar stated that in the 21st century, the world economy was expected to witness a paradigm shift from hydrocarbon based economy to carbohydrate based one. Sugarcane as one of the most efficient crop in harnessing solar energy will play an important role in this shift, he said.

While making introductory remarks, VSI director general V P Rane said that the sugar industry has to reach production level of 27 million tonnes by 2020 to meet the domestic requirement of sugar. The export market was also expected to grow to reach 175 million tonnes mark, he said.

Rane pointed out that enhanced sugarcane production was needed not just to produce more sugar but also for producing ethanol and bagasse for electricity cogeneration.

He said that it was realised that the challenges could be met only through crop biotechnology. Rane regretted that biotechnology for sugarcane improvement lagged behind that of major crops like maize and soybean. He called for interactions and linkages among VSI and other research institutions to facilitate research.

Over 25 Indian and foreign scientists are attending the seminar to present their papers on mapping of sugarcane genes, genetic transformation for biotic and abiotic stress tolerance.

Some scientists will also present papers on the prospects of developing sugarcane varieties for production of higher sugar content, better quality fibre for cogeneration and paper production, degradable plastics and other topics.

11,ISI mark must for electrical equipment,"NEW DELHI: From now on, look for the ISI mark on electrical products. The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS), custodian of the ISI mark, has just made certification of 24 electrical items mandatory. This means no person can sell, store or manufacture any of these items without the mark.

If they do, it could mean a penalty of Rs 50,000 or imprisonment of up to a year, or both â€” and stiffer penalties are on the agenda.

With more and more homes using electrical gadgets, the Union consumer affairs ministry had been getting complaints on inferior quality. The list of items needing mandatory certification includes immersion water heaters, irons, stoves, radiators, and switches.
