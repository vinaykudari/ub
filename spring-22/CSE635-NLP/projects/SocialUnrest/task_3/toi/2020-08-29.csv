1,Primary teachers protest govt decision,"LUDHIANA: Under the banner of Primary/Elementary Sikhiya Bachao Front Punjab, eight primary teachersâ€™ unions of the state on Friday organised a joint demonstartion against the governmentâ€™s decision to hand over the control of government primary schools, including recruitment of teachers to panchayats, municipal corporations and municipal committees from October 2 at mini-secretariat here.

The speakers, including Punjab Government Primary Teachers Union president Piara Singh Dhillon, accused the government of creating conditions that pervailed before 1957 when these schools were targeted as â€˜â€˜centres of political intriguesâ€™â€™ by the chairmen of zila parishad and municipal committees.

It was after sustained struggle that the control of primary schools was taken over directly by the government, they said. The governmentâ€™s decision to revert to this system was bound to create problems like the delay in releasing of teachersâ€™ salaries for months together, they feared. The speakers warned the government that they would not allow it to leave about 50,000 primary teachers at the mercy of local bodies.

The agitating teachers raised slogans against the governmentâ€™s decisions to form elementary directorate by disbanding primary eductaion directorate, removing avenues of their promotions, stopping admissions to ETT classes, their transfers and suspensions through raids conducted by the officials ofVigilance Bureau. The next demonstration will be held on September 12 in front of the DC office, Faridkot.

3,Cong training camp turns into political rally,"BATHINDA: A district-level workers training camp of the Congress committee which was presided over by All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary Mohsina Kidwai and Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee chief HS Hanspal here on Friday turned into a political rally.

While the workers over the district have participated in the training camp to share their feelings and experience with their leaders in view of the forthcoming parliamentary election but the occasion was used by senior Congress leaders for taking digs at SAD and BJP-bashing and praising the performance of the state government.

While the party workers from rural areas were annoyed and felt resentful as the Congress leaders did not give them a chance to express their feelings at the training camp, Mohsina Kidwai admitted that the objective of the training camp could not be met due to heavy rush of the workers.

Besides, the local Congress party leaders were determined to use the camp as â€˜â€˜a selfpromotion trip.â€™â€™ Everone wanted to capture a chair at the dais and sit beside Mohsina Kidwai. HS Hanspal was very critical of these leaders, saying from the stage that the only motive of these leaders was to get a photo clicked with the senior leaders.

â€˜â€˜I know you are the real workers of the party and am here to talk to you and listen your grievances,â€™â€™ a wary Hanspal said, while trying to mollify the party workers who were annoyed for not having been given a chance to ventillate their grievances. The main complaint of the party workers was that they were ignored by the district administration.

The Congress party workers were shown no regard in government offices and this â€˜â€˜arrogance of the bureaucratsâ€™â€™ was distancing the workers from the party, said Gurjant Singh Kutiwal, a party MLA in Bathinda district.

â€˜â€˜I request you to ask the bureaucrats to change their attitude towards the Congress party workers,â€™â€™ Kutiwal urged Hanspal and Mohsina.

Later on speaking to media persons, Mohsina told that though the alliance governments in the states and at Centre always failed to meet the desired level of development but the Congress was not averse to forming an alliance government in the present circumstances to defeat communal parities like the BJP.

â€˜â€˜The Congress would join hand with only the like-minded and secular parties during the forthcoming parliamentary elections,â€™â€™ she said. She accused the Union government for its partial attitude towards the states which were governed by the Congress party.

4,Blast tales: When the govt needs a hearing aid,"MUMBAI: Ashok Buyar cannot afford to take a taxi to work everyday. But often, he does not have a choice. The 45-year-old suffered leg injuries in the Mulund bomb blast on March 13 and can now walk only with crutches.

â€œI wait for the trains to empty out and I leave for work in the afternoons when there is no crowd,â€™â€™ says Mr Buyar, who is stores incharge at a restaurant at Mahalaxmi racecourse. Sometimes, he covers some of the distance from his house in Thane by taxi. â€œI canâ€™t sit at home,â€™â€™ says Mr Buyar,who draws Rs 8,000 a month. For four months after the blast, he could not work as he had to undergo operations.

He managed to trudge to work only this month and is still worried about his hospital bills of Rs 1 lakh, which his employer paid. â€œI donâ€™t know if that money will be cut from my salary,â€™â€™ the father of two says. Such uncertainty has become a part of life for Mr Buyar and other victims of the Mulund bomb blast. Their stories, splashed across newspapers and television channels for a couple of days after the blast, now lie buried under newer newsâ€”there have been bomb blasts after the one at Mulund, there have been other victims.

Like Mr Buyar, they all lead their lives in anonymity and silence, carrying the scars of a day when the world around them exploded and changed forever. The memories came rushing back this week after the twin blasts in the city that killed 53 and injured nearly 200. â€œI was on duty when I heard about it, I cannot explain how I felt then,â€™â€™Mr Buyar says. â€œFor others, it is just a blast, they walk away and get back to their routine. I know what it is to be in a bomb blast, how it is to walk with crutches with everyday and see other people staring at you.â€™â€™

Like Mr Buyar, most blast victims have not got much of a compensation so far. The government gave them only Rs 5,000 immediately after the blast. Eighty blast victims have applied before the railway tribunal for compensation, meant to cover their medical costs. But then, there are wounds that even money cannot heal. Twenty- four-year-old Ganesh Khore will vouch for that. This Kalyan resident, who used to sell toys near Parel station,was in the compartment where the bomb was kept. Pieces of metal pierced his hands and his hearing was affected because of the explosion. Mr Khore doesnâ€™t travel by trains anymore. He left his Parel job and now works in a auto rickshaw servicing centre in Kalyan to avoid commuting. He is bitter about the politicians who made visits to the hospitals soon after the blasts.

â€œThey talk but donâ€™t do anything,â€™â€™ he says. â€œEven the chief minister came and saw us and just went away.â€™â€™ Salesman Nilesh Bhadra (29), who developed hearing problems after the Mulund blast, is also awaiting compensation. He has no money to go in for a ear surgery. There is still hope, though. MP Kirit Somaiya, who has been handling the Mulund blast victimsâ€™ cases, says that by September, the victims will be compensated for the expenses incurred on medical treatment by a special cell of the railway tribunal.

5,All-party meet on sharing of water,"HYDERABAD: Fearing that the dispute between farmers in Telangana and Krishna delta over water from the Nagarjunasagar project might take an ugly turn, the state government has decided to convene an all-party meeting on Sept 2 to resolve the issue.

Talking to reporters here on Friday, major irrigation minister Kadiam Srihari said the government would place details like rainfall figures, inflows into the Krishna and Godavari basins and the ayacuts under either basin before the leaders well in advance.

Remarking that the state was facing a peculiar situation, he said statistics indicated that the state received 472 mm of rainfall up to August 25, or 3 per cent above normal.

In terms of water flows into various reservoirs, however, the situation was still a cause of worry.

The past two years being drought years, ground water levels had gone down and whatever rain the state received this year went towards correcting this imbalance.

Added to this, the inflows into the Krishna continued to be critical. So far the basin had received only 179 tmc as against the normal figure of 229 tmc. â€œWater is just trickling in thousands of cusecs which does not serve any purpose,â€� the minister said.

Holding Karnataka responsible for the situation, he said it had impounded 127 tmc at Almatti. As per rules, it should have a cushion space of 10 per cent of the available water to meet flash floods. But Karnataka had provided a cushion of only two per cent.

In case of floods, this could adversely effect the safety of the dam. â€œThis greed of the state had prevented Andhra from getting its due share of water,â€™â€™ he added.

6,"Govt will protect affected staff, promises minister","BANGALORE: A day after the Supreme Court dismissed a petition filed by the Karnataka government seeking a review of the apex court''s judgment striking down reservation for rural poor in government recruitment, law and parliamentary affairs minister D B Chandre Gowda on Friday said it will not have any implication on plans to protect interest of affected employees.

""The review petition filed by the government was just one of the options exercised by us. Its dismissal will not have any bearing on our move to absorb employees, who have been affected by the court''s earlier judgement,"" Gowda told The Times of India here.

The review petition was dismissed by the Supreme Court division bench comprising Justice Ruma Pal and Justice B N Srikrishna. The minister said the government had already framed rules to absorb the affected employees as an alternative.

On August 23, the Cabinet approved special rules framed to absorb 4,800 employees selected on rural weightage basis.

The rules titled - Karnataka Civil Services Absorption of Persons appointed to Civil Services under Rural Weightage benefits 2003 - would be published shortly calling for objections.

""The apex court''s judgment will not come in the way of this procedure,"" he contended.

Earlier in the day, the affected employees, under the banner of the Government Employees'' Association, met chief minister S M Krishna in the wake of the dismissal of the review petition.

""The CM has assured the employees that they will be reappointed. The special rules have already been framed. We are awaiting the next step,"" Association president K. Sippe Gowda said.

He said affected employees had been urged not to take any extreme step in view of the developments.

8,"Protesters caned; 52 arrested, freed","HUBLI/DHARWAD: The agitation demanding setting up of a high court Bench at Hubli-Dharwad turned violent on Friday, forcing police to resort to a mild lathicharge.

9,Students union elections not welcome,"LUCKNOW: Student leaders in the state capital are in an upbeat mood after announcement by the new chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav on holding of studentsâ€™ union elections in colleges and universities as early as possible.

However, this decision has sent a chill down the spine of many general students and teachers of Lucknow University, who feel that revival of student politics with the support of political parties will not only spoil the law and order on the campus but also delay the session.

Union elections have not been held for the last three years in LU after the BJP state government put an age bar of 25 years for contesting students union elections. The decision was challenged in the high court. Senior LU officers remained tightlipped over the issue saying that the matter was pending in the court and they would not comment on it.

They, however, promptly dispatched a report sought by the government on the status of students union elections. Announcement on rollback in fee hike was welcomed but with a rider that the government should compensate for over Rs 3 crore loss due to it because LU was already facing a budgetary loss of Rs 10 crore.

The election announcement has not been taken well by general students, who are preparing for their backpaper examinations, scheduled next month. Besides, there was a threat of delay of the LU academic session, which was regularised only two years back after a long gap of over 25 years.

Teachers felt that blatant interference in administrative work would increase. Akriti, a BA III student, pointed out that there would be rise in cases of eve-teasing and harassment of girls by rowdy elements, who are supporters of student leaders.

Most student leaders thrive on extortion and contract business. They give shelter to criminals in hostels. Teachers recalled incidents of violence and bloodshed among these student leaders to grab power during union polls. â€œA government formed with the support of

such student leaders cannot check their criminal activities,â€� they said.

10,Kidnapping: STF arrests DySP,"LUCKNOW: In one of the first ever move of its kind, the Special Task Force (STF) of the state police on Friday arrested a serving deputy superintendent of police (DySP) for his alleged role in the much publicised Dr Maheshwari kidnapping case in Mathura. The STF was now on the lookout for another policeman posted at the office of the divisional commissioner, Aligarh for his role in the crime.

Senior Superintendent of Police (STF) Anil Kumar Agarwal told Times News Network that on August 27, one Surendra Kumar Khandelwal, who owns a chemist shop at Maheshwari hospital in Mathura, was arrested following specific leads that he was collecting ransom payment from Dr Maheshwari to transfer it to the kidnappers.

Dr Maheshwari was kidnapped and later returned home safe after Rs 40 lakh was paid as ransom. As the deal was struck for Rs 60 lakh, Dr Maheshwari was asked to pay the remaining amount after his release. Twice Dr Maheshwari had paid instalments of Rs 5 lakh each to Surendra and when he came to collect the third instalment, he was arrested.

During interrogation Surendra revealed that the ransom which he collected from Dr Maheshwari was being handed over to Trideep Singh, a deputy superintendent of police posted as circle officer Krishna Janambhoomi security in Mathura.

Investigations had also revealed that earlier when Trideep was posted as zonal officer of the intelligence department at Mathura, a policeman identified as Ranveer Singh Malik, who then worked under him, got the DySP in touch with Bobby Jat, a listed gangster of Aligarh who was known for kidnappings and murders.

As Bobby Jat had executed the kidnapping of Dr Maheshwari, Malik and DySP Trideep Singh played the role of the mediator and led to the negotiations for ransom between the kidnappers and the victimâ€™s family. DySP Trideep Singh even collected the first ransom instalment of Rs 40 lakh from the kin of Dr Maheshwari.

The cash, after due share was deducted, was sent to the Bobby gang through Malik who was hand in glove with the kidnappers.

On the statement of Surendra Khandelwal, the STF on Friday arrested Trideep Singh and, following his confession about his involvement in the crime, he was thoroughly interrogated. He is learnt to have confessed to his involvement in the kidnapping case and was leading the police team to conduct raids for the recovery of the ransom money which had reportedly been hoarded at a safe place.

The STF team involved in the investigations contested that their team was in possession of clinching evidences against DySP Trideep Singh and the electronic fingerprints were so much irrefutable that there was little scope for the police officer to sneak out of the case. Efforts were on to trace Malik and other associates involved in the kidnapping case. The kidnapping case was busted by the STF recently after half a dozen people involved in the crime were arrested. Information extracted from these arrested gang members had lead the STF to the arrest of the DySP.

11,Biodynamic farming holds the key,"LUCKNOW: While pesticide and insecticide toxicity and environmental degradation are causes for growing concern, several alternative cropping practices are being increasingly explored as â€˜healthyâ€™ agricultural practices. Prominent among these, are organic farming, nature farming, angara, rishi krishi, panch kavya, biodynamic farming, etc.

The most outstanding aspect of biodynamic farming is that none of the inputs are purchased from outside. According to senior scientist, Dr RA Ram, Central Institute of Subtropical Horticulture (CISH), 500 g of compost developed through a â€˜cow pat pitâ€™ obtained at a marginal cost, is sufficient for an acre of farm land.

For a similar sized field, comparatively, 4-5 bags of relatively expensive urea will be required. In addition to this, the soil usually absorbs only 46 per cent of the nitrogen released, and the rest is wasted. Leeching causes the formation of nitrous oxide that has been linked with the destruction of the ozone layer, and nitrates are responsible for the pollution of groundwater.

A national level symposium on â€˜Organic farming in horticulture for sustainable productionâ€™ was organised by CISH on Friday, and was inaugurated by member agriculture, planning commission, Dr Sompal Shastri. In his inaugural address, Dr Shastri said organic farming is not new to India, as it has been practised by farmers in India for over 10,000 years now.

â€œSome believe that organic farming causes a reduction in crop yield, but with modern varieties, mechanisation and better irrigation facilities, this factor too has been negated,â€� he explained.

Dr RK Pathak, director, CISH, said that chemical-based plant protection practices have led to the compaction of soil, low organic matter content in the soil, increase in salinity, sodicity and land submergence, adverse effect on flora and fauna and also a deterioration in the quality of the farm produce.

In sharp contrast, â€˜Biodynamic agricultureâ€™ means â€˜working with the energies that create and maintain lifeâ€™. Under this system, the energies from the cosmos, earth, the cow and plants, are systematically and synergistically harnessed for enhancing crop production and to establish, maintain and increase the soilâ€™s ecosystem.

Examples of successful farming practices can be seen in mango orchards for the rejuvenation of the trees. A biodynamic tree paste made from mixing cow dung, clay and sand, was used to seal and heal the wounds and for the protection from and control of diseases that are like a plague, wreaking havoc in mango orchards.

G Kalloo, DDG, ICAR, Delhi, said that there are a number of organic compounds that may be used as parasite predators and used to replace chemical fertilisers. â€œThere is a need to develop technology for the identification and development of bio-agents and also a system for certification, inspection and accreditation of organic crops,â€� he stressed.

12,Students fear govt will not meet MCI deadline,"HYDERABAD: Students in the city are on tenterhooks, as counselling for admission in medical and dental colleges has not been completed even three months after the start of the academic year.

The September 30 deadline set by the MCI for completion of admissions has caused further consternation. They are of the opinion that even if the government begins counselling now, it will not be able to meet the deadline.

The directorate of medical education, New Delhi, recently ordered all health secretaries to complete admissions before the stipulated time. If any of the colleges fail to do so, the institute will have to pay Rs 50,000 for each admission.

The latest directive of the Medical Council of India â€” putting a bar on the government to conduct counselling for 270 seats in five government colleges â€” has further aggravated the agony of over 30,000 aspirants in the state.

The delay is also causing anxiety on the financial front for several students, as they debate whether they will get a seat in the government or private medical colleges.

This is especially so among students from poor financial backgrounds, as the government is yet to come out with a clear policy on medical admissions. Almost all universities have completed the admission process for other undergraduate courses.

Veena Sravanthi, who got 113 rank in Eamcet-2003 (Medical) told The Times of India nearly half an academic year was lost due to the delay in conducting the counselling.

Further, the government should get clearance for 270 medical seats in five government colleges as it would pave the wave for commencement of admission process.

Another student U Venkateswarlu, who secured 139 rank, said counselling should be conducted as early as possible to meet the deadline as the admissions of previous years were hampered by legal cases.

G Praveen Chandra, who bagged 186 rank, says the fate of students in AP is hanging in balance while our neighbouring states had come to an agreement with the private college managements on admissions. The government should make an effort to dispel fears on the deadline and on the status of the 270 seats as it would have a bearing on counselling for the medical seats in government colleges.

He said students are wondering how the government can remain a mute spectator to the whole issue, and wanted it to come out with a statement on counselling.

Meanwhile, a senior official said the department had sought legal guidance on some controversial matters and would soon issue a notification.

13,Mulayam govt on damage-control spree,"LUCKNOW: Following Chief Minister Mulayam Singh Yadav''s dramatic announcement withdrawing Pota charges against Independent MLA Raghuraj Pratap Singh, his father Uday Pratap Singh and Akshay Pratap Singh, an MLC, the home department has already begun a damage control exercise.

As per the prescribed procedure, the law department will move an application to the special court in Kanpur, which alone has the final authority to take a decision on the issue.

There were other legal formalities to be completed with which might take some time, said sources in the law department hinting that the detenues were likely to be finally by September 5.

Raja Bhaiyya, his father and the independent MLC were booked under Pota by the Mayawati-led government. Principal secretary home, Pradeep Kumar, clarified to media persons that the Pota detenues had not been charged with anti-national activities (Section 3 of the Act). Kumar said that they were charged with the possession of AK-56 rifle.

Reacting to the news of removal of Pota charges, Raja Bhaiyya said, ""People like Mayawati are dangerous for any democracy. She is a ham-headed dictator. She should be barred from public life.""

He could not hide his gratitude for his ""liberator"", Mulayam Singh Yadav, whose assumption of power followed the bitter break-up of the BSP-BJP coalition.

""I am grateful to Mulayam Yadav for undoing the injustice meted out to me by his predecessor, who hounded me simply because I rebelled against her,"" Raja Bhaiyya said.

14,Eminent citizens rally for peace in Mumbai,"MUMBAI: Is the Maharashtra government doing enough to curb hate speech and writing at a time of growing communal tension?

Communal harmony groups and concerned citizens who believe that enforcing anti-hate speech laws will help promote peace say the state government is reluctant to crack down on rabble rousers. In a meeting with chief minister Sushilkumar Shinde on Wednesday, several prominent citizens pressed for vigorous enforcement of laws like Section 153-A and 295 of the Indian Penal Code, which provide for punishment against inflammatory speeches and writings.

â€˜â€˜The real aim of a terrorist is to polarise society,â€™â€™ lyricist Javed Akthar reasoned. â€˜â€˜Such writings also polarise society, and aid terrorists.â€™â€™ Aktharâ€™s views were echoed by Mumbai University vice-chancellor B L Mungekar, who said: â€˜â€˜Since 1993, the political process in the city has been based on hatred because of communal propaganda and poison spread through various publications.

We need to stop it.â€™â€™ Additional chief secretary (home) U Mukhopadhyay said the state government would consider the citizensâ€™ demands. â€˜â€˜But will wielding a big stick stop communal hatred? In the name of pursuing action, we should not create more conflict,â€™â€™ he said. While it is the recent bomb blasts that have spurred citizensâ€™ groups to lobby for greater enforcement of Section 153-A, momentum on this demand has been building since the Gujarat communal riots last year.

15,"Kadam encroaching on govt land? No, says the minister","PUNE: Close on the heels of the controversial Bharati Vidyapeeth road issue, state industries minister Patangrao Kadam seems to have got embroiled in yet another land-related controversy.

This time, in the upmarket Deccan Gymkhana area.

Kadam is being charged with constructing a personal car shed on the property belonging to the Maharashtra Krishna Valley Development Corporation (MKVDC).

Kadam''s bungalow, opposite the Brihan Maharashtra College of Commerce (BMCC), is adjacent to MKVDC''s branch office.

There is no wall or fence separating the two properties although they have separate gates.

A visit to the place on Thursday revealed that Kadam had constructed a car shed on MKVDC land and was using it to park his cars. The MKVDC gate was also being manned by his staff.

Speaking to TNN on condition of anonymity, senior MKVDC officials said the corporation owns 2,440 square-feet of land on plot number 288 on the BMCC road.

They were categorical that Kadam had encroached on their land by constructing the shed.

An MKVDC official said, ""We had taken up the matter with Kadam''s office, but our complaint has fallen on deaf ears. We have not yet complained in writing. What''s the use? Will the government take action against a minister,"" he asked.

Kadam, when contacted at his residence, said the MKVDC office stands on the land that belongs to the Navkranti residential society, of which he is a member.

According to him, the land was barren and was lying unused till the society developed it a few years ago. ""The MKVDC requested the society for use of the land to construct its office and we agreed.

That is how its office came up there in August 2001,"" Kadam added. ""I, therefore, don''t understand what the fuss is all about. Why can''t I park my cars on the land that belongs to the society,"" Kadam asked.

On the other hand, a senior MKVDC official said the entire land on which the Navkranti society stands belongs to the irrigation department.

""The land was sold to the society many years ago. However, the 2,440 square feet plot of land on which our office stands was always in our possession.

Kadam has definitely encroached on our property. He must remove the shed and construct a compound wall to demarcate the two properties,"" the official added.

According to the official, one of the prime reasons why the MKVDC office was constructed on the plot was to prevent Kadam from encroaching on the entire land.

16,Bangla army torture breeds unrest in Hill Tracts,"AGARTALA: The situation in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) in Bangladesh, adjacent to South Tripura district, has become volatile again following army atrocities on the indigenous people of the region.

The situation has become critical particularly after the killing of an elderly Chakma inhabitant in Khagracherri on August 26 by the Bangladesh army. The murder was followed by largescale arson and an attack on a Buddhist temple.

Though CHT has been facing political crisis for several years now, the latest violence was triggered off when a Bengali Hindu was kidnapped by miscreants from the Mahalchari area. In retaliation, on August 26, the Bangladesh army and the settlers attacked the neighbouring Jumma villages.

â€œThe army first opened fire to scare the Jumma villagers. Thereafter, the illegal settlers (Bengali Muslims), armed with machetes, sticks and axes, swooped down on the indigenous Jummas. They severely beat up Binod Bihari Khisha, a community elder and then handed him over to armymen, who in turn tortured him to death,â€� said an activist of Hill Watch Human Rights Forum from Dhaka.

The rights activist said that on the following day, August 27, the non-tribals accompanied by the army, burnt down 140 Jumma houses and shops at Babupara, Mahalchari and Lemuchari in Khagrachari district. They also ransacked a Buddhist temple and beat up a monk.

Two Marma girls were kidnapped.

The attacks sparked off tension in the CHT. Various Jumma organisations were up in arms demanding probe into Khishaâ€™s killing and the violence. They have also demanded compensation for the affected families.

Ever since 1975, CHT has remained a flash point of conflict with the massacre of Jummas by the Bangladesh security forces in an attempt to settle the plain land Muslim farmers in the hills. This not only led to armed struggle but also forced 70,000 Jummas, 10 per cent of their population, to seek shelter in neighbouring Tripura.

17,SGPC protests against 'misinformation',"AMRITSAR: The SGPC has expressed concern over debates and panel discussions being organised and produced on TV channels regarding certain Sikh issues which, according to the SGPC, are spreading ""misinformation"" to the viewers, specially to the Sikhs.

In a communication sent to the managing director, Zee TV (a copy of which was released to the media on Saturday), SGPC chief secretary Manjit Singh Calcutta claimed that the SGPC''s office in Amritsar was flooded with numerous complaints from different sections of the Sikhs from all over the world, protesting against such representations.

""It has been observed that your moderator betrays utter ignorance about the simple fundamentals of the Sikh religion. He fails to confine the debates to the subject, thus making irresponsible and blasphemous remarks about Sikh tenets, conventions and authority,"" said the letter.

SGPC has raised a serious objection on the debate between Gurcharanjit Singh Lamba and Mohinder Singh Josh about a book written by Gurbax Singh Kala Afghana, which has been banned by Akal Takht. Moreover, the author has been excommunicated by the Takht. The programme was relayed on August 28.

""During the discussion, Josh spoke irreverently about Akal Takht and its jathedar and the institution of ''hukamnama'' leading to utter confusion and strife,"" said the letter.

18,Four arrested in Kavediya case,"PUNE: The city police on Friday afternoon arrested four persons in connection with city businessman Mahendra Kavediya''s murder, which shocked the city earlier this week.

Announcing the arrests at a press conference later on Friday, police commissioner A N Roy said the four - Roopesh Marne (20), Manoj Mangilal Sharma (28), Kondiba Dayal (33) and Vijay Kasurde (36) - all residents of Kothrud, were arrested by a team from the Swargate police, led by inspector Vasant Tambe.

It may recalled that Kavediya was stabbed to death near Sarasbaug in the parking lot of the Harjivan hospital on Monday night.

According to Roy, the four men had confessed to killing Kavediya with choppers and swords.
