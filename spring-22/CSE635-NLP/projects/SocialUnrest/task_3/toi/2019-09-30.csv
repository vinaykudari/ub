0,BSP rally failed to address grievances of people,"LUCKNOW: Big as BSPâ€™s dhikkar rally may have been, bigger were the problems which thousands brought to the rally on Saturday.

Village folks, nursing hopes of getting some redressal, came with their problems written on pieces of papers. They were probably told to do so, because otherwise so many would not have come with it in the first place. Perhaps, they thought, this was the opportune moment to plcae their problems before their leader Mayawati. But little did they know what exactly was to happen to their applications.

Rajmani is a diehard Bahujan Samaja Party (BSP) supporter. He came all the way from his Ahungikalan village hut in Haliya police circle of Lalganj Tehsil in Mirzapur. He learnt that the chief minister could be told about his plight and get help in return.

His plight; earning 2 kg of foodgrain in exchange for a dayâ€™s labour from a money-lender from whom he had taken loan for his daughterâ€™s marriage. He needs money and there is no way he can get it considering the manner in which he ekes out a living. He sought Adharniya Mukhya Mantri Jiâ€™s attention towards his plight and that of the others in his community in the village. He handed over a handwitten application to the authorities apparently with a hope, that â€œsomeoneâ€� would listen to him.

But on Sunday morning, his application was found lying among a heap of other over 20,000 similar applications.

The state government, at the instance of the CM, had made arrangements to collect applications from rallyist at the Ambedkar sthal. On the orders of the chief secretary, the district magistrate Lucknow Navneet Sehgal was designated to collect the apllications and hand them over to the officers of the CMâ€™s office and representatives of Transport Minister Naseemuddin Siddiqui who was also incharge of organising the rally. As per the Chief Secretaryâ€™s order, each and every application received was to be replied.

When contacted by Times News Network (TNN) Sehgal said that he had collected thousands of applications from the rallyist. â€œAfter the rally was over, these applications were tied in stacks and a jeep load of them were handed over to the officers of the CMâ€™s office and that of the Transport Minister,â€� Sehgal said. â€œAll the applications which I had collected are very much there safe and intact,â€� Sehgal said feigning ignorance about those recovered from the rally site.

â€œSome others may have also collected the applications, which they left behind after the rally was over. Or, the applications may have been swept from all over the venue on Sunday morning. These may have been thrown by the rallyists themselves, â€œ he said.

Whatever the truth is, one thing is clear that the near-20000 applications indicate that the rallysts came thinking Mayawati would help them. Right from installation of handpumps, waving off petty personal loans, to any sort of help for the marriage of their daughter, everythign was there. Some were even recommended by their local BSP leaders and MLAs.

1,Civil aviation a victim of govt apathy,"PATNA: Civil aviation in Bihar is in a shambles due to ad-hocism, aging planes, a number of posts of pilots remaining vacant and aging maintenance engineers being given extension time and again.

The Bihar Flying Institute (BFI) has virtually become defunct ever since its acting chief instructor pilot N K Singh was jailed and suspended on the charge of theft of an aircraft part from the Jamshedpur flying club.

â€œAfter spending Rs 10 lakh each to get the requisite 250 hours of flying experience for a commercial pilotâ€™s licence, about 30 BFI students do not know what to do with their licences as there are no jobs around,â€� stated a senior state civil aviation directorate official. Earlier, the Bihar government had three planes and two choppers. One of the planes was given to Jharkhand.

Director-cum-secretary of the state civil aviation department and chief government pilot Avinash Kumar Sinha is scheduled to retire within two months. But like the three maintenance engineers, Sinha is also expected to get extension of service for â€œtechnical reasonsâ€�.

â€œV S Dubey in his capacity as finance commissioner had objected to the repeated extension granted to engineers and remarked that the Bihar government should take initiative to replace the retiring technical staff by advertising for fresh recruits. But whenever such advertisements are issued, the appointment criteria are made so stringent that no applications are received, and this ensures that the old order continues,â€� stated an official of the department, adding that the post of additional director has deliberately been kept vacant for the last five years.

Department officials say so poor is the perception of the intricacies of civil aviation that when a pilot belly-landed his aircraft with a political leader on board, he was given an appreciation letter along with a cash award of Rs 10,000 when he should have been punished for making a technical error while landing.

The BFI, once regarded as one of the best institutes of its kind in the country, is suffering from ad-hocism and lack of discipline. Established as the Bihar Flying Club in 1949, it used to train Royal Air Force cadets. It was taken over by the Bihar government in 1974 and brought directly under the chief minister in 1999. Students of this institute complain that due to the â€œarbitrary way of functioning of BFI officialsâ€� some of them are stuck with the 30-month course for six to seven years.

In 1999, Captain Sachindra Choudhary, an assistant pilot instructor of the institute, wrote a long letter to the DGCA highlighting a series of alleged omission and commission in the BFI.

The same year Choudhary and a student were killed in Patna as their plane crashed. For a long time, BFI students did not have planes to fly.

The Bihar government purchased four new planes for the institute from a company which had offered to send its trainers for giving training to BFI pilots.

Instead a senior official of the department went abroad to take the training.

2,Naidu not to brook any opposition to govt plans,"VIJAYAWADA: Chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu has warned the Telugu Desam Party leaders here not to create impediments in the implementation of the Vijayawada Development Plan.

Talking to The Times of India during his visit to Guntur on Saturday, Naidu asserted that stern action would be taken against any leader, irrespective of his stature, if he opposed the governmentâ€™s decisions.

The chief minister was particularly harsh on agriculture minister Vadde Sobhanadreeswara Rao, Vijayawada MP Gadde Ramamohan Rao and Kankipadu MLA Yelamanchili Nageswara Rao who have been opposing the VGTM-UDAs mega township project at Nunna and the Eluru Road expansion work in the city.

â€œI understand that there are some problems at the local level on various civic issues. But the party leaders can take them up with the government or the high command. If they go public with their opposition of government decisions, we will act very stubbornly,â€� Naidu asserted.

Questioned about city mayor P Anuradhaâ€™s threat to resign from her post over her growing differences with the local party leaders, the TDP president said that senior party leaders have been asked to act in close co-ordination and resolve all issues.

The question of mayorâ€™s resignation does not arise, Naidu observed. About the party leadersâ€™ opposition to the policy initiatives of the government on various civic issues, Naidu said: â€œWhen we undertake some reforms, there will obviously be some problems. But things will stabilise in time. Our policies are very clear and the reforms will not stop come what may. I will not tolerate anyone who tries to block the reforms process.""

Naidu said that he had obtained a report on the anti-party activities of the Telugu Desam Party leaders here and asserted that he would take appropriate action at the earliest to put things on track.

Questioned about the issuing of Government Orders on various civic issuesoverruling the Council resolutions, Naidu pointed out: â€œShould the government remain a mute spectator if the Council adopts any resolution that is against public interest? The Council should take decisions that are in the interest of the citizens and not pursue their vested interests. The Council should take decisions in tune with government policies.â€�

8,2 arhtiyas held for forcing farmer to kill himself,"BATHINDA: The Bathinda police has booked two grain commission agents of Rama Mandi for allegedly forcing a farmer of Chathe Wala village to commit suicide.

The farmer, Jagroop Singh (40), ended his life by consuming pesticide on May, 3 2002 after he was allegedly fleeced by the commission agents Bhola Ram andAshok Kumar of Rama Mandi.

The police registered a case under Section 306/34 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) against the accused at Kot Fatta police station on Saturday.

The farmerâ€™s suicide had stirred a controversy at that time and the police had instituted an enquiry into the incident after the Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) (Ekta) pressed for the registration of a case against the commission agents.

During investigation it was found the deceased owned only four acres of land and was reeling under heavy debt.

In a suicide note that was recovered from his pocket, Jagroop Singh had urged that his children be saved from the commission agents.

9,NDA govt being unjust to farmers: Bajwa,"KAHNUWAN, Pathankot: The standoff between the farmers and the Centre is creating a situation of economic unrest in the state, said PWD minister Partap Singh Bajwa, who was on a stone-laying spree in the area on Monday.

The minister said, â€˜â€˜The NDA government at the Centre has been unjust with the farmers of Punjab by not enhancing the Minimum Support Price (MSP) of paddy. The NDA government wants to create a situation of economic unrest in Punjab. It would not be surprising if tomorrow, the situation in the state is similar to that in Kashmir.

""First the drought, then the delay in announcing the date of procurement followed by the announcement of an unexpected MSP, as recommended by Captain Saheb (Amarinder Singh), will take its toll.

""The anti-Punjab farmer stance of the Vajpayee government smacks of petty politics since there is a Congress government in the state.â€™â€™ He addressed farmers at several places in Kahnuwan constituency.

Bajwa added that the BJP leadership at the Centre was in cahoots with former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal.

The MSP was not hiked despite the chief ministerâ€™s sit-in in front of Prime Minister â€˜s official residence, only to embarrass the Congress government.

Bajwa also said that he was unhappy that the Centre had reduced the cess on paddy, which went into the stateâ€™s kitty, from 11.5 per cent to four per cent.

This despite Punjab contributing more than 52 per cent of its paddy to the central kitty, he added. In the event of the reduction, the Punjab government could lose nearly Rs 1000 crore, Bajwa told mediapersons.

â€˜â€˜When we met the PM recently at his office in Delhi, the reduction of cess did not figure at all in the deliberations. It was later added in the minutes of the meeting,â€™â€™ said Bajwa.

10,‘Tihar rules won’t change for ex-IG’,"NEW DELHI: Prime suspect in Shivani Bhatnagar murder case R K Sharma has reportedly found the treatment at the Delhi Policeâ€™s interrogation cell unpalatable.

His experience at Tihar, his next possible destination, is unlikely to be any different. Here prisoners are served jeera aloo, bread and tea at breakfast and are made to stand in the playground for early morning prayers.

â€˜â€˜Special treatment is the last thing the IPS officer can expect from us,â€™â€™ said jail law officer Sunil Gupta. Tihar officials claimed he would be treated like any ordinary undertrial.

In fact, Sharma, who visited Tihar just four months back as Inspector-General (prisons), stands a greater risk of being thrashed by fellow undertrials. â€˜â€˜Policemen sent to jail always invite the wrath of undertrials who vent their anger against the khaki,â€™â€™ said a jail official.

â€˜â€˜We have had instances of a Seelampur constable and a Haryana SSP being hounded by undertrials. This is why jailed police officials prefer to remain confined to their cells, he said.

Sharma is likely to get jail number 1, where another Haryana cadre IPS official, Harish Kumar, is lodged. â€˜â€˜The jailâ€™s cells are spacious and inmates can be segregated from other undertrials,â€™â€™ said an official.

Sharmaâ€™s fare during his stay in the jail is likely to be dominated by lentils, vegetables and chapati. Evening tea is likely to be served with roasted grams. â€˜â€˜Even if Sharma insists on home-cooked food, it may not be allowed more than twice a week,â€™â€™ a jail official said.

His will be allowed to meet his family or friends up to twice a week. â€˜â€˜We cannot bend rules for him. If someone tries to favour him, other undertrials may drag us to court,â€™â€™ said Gupta.

11,All-party meet on power fails to reach accord,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: An all-party meeting convened by the UDF government on Monday failed to evolve a consensus on steps to overcome the current power crisis in the state as the government and oppostion could not strike common ground.

The meeting was convened to disscus the crisis in the power sector and to find a solution after the government was forced to withdraw a steep power tariff hike following public protest.

""Though both sides agree that there is an acute crisis in the power sector calling for urgent steps, they differ on the steps to be taken to tide over the crisis,"" Chief Minister A K Antony told reporters at the end of the three-hour meeting.

He said this was only a beginning and more unofficial talks would be held with all concerned before taking a final decision. However, he said, a decision on the issue could not be prolonged.

Different views were expressed both on the cause of the crisis and measures to tackle the issue. He said the talks were held without any prejudice and government had an open mind on the issue.

Electricity minister Kadvoor Sivadasan said it was not good for the board to delay a decision on the matter as it was incurring a revenue deficit of Rs.184 crore every month. ""With each passing day, the loss of the board also will naturally mount"", he said.

The minister said suggestions put forward by opposition leader V S Achuthanandan were not practical enough to solve the current impasse triggered by monsoon failure.

12,Weak law may help Salman get away,"MUMBAI: If someone were to hit you, causing even a small crack in your finger, he could be booked for â€˜â€˜causing grievous hurt â€˜â€™ under section 325 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), a non-bailable offence, and made to serve up to seven years behind bars, says noted criminal lawyer P.R. Vakil. But if someone speeding down the road in his car were to knock down a pedestrian and kill him, he need not fear. He can only be booked under section 304 A of the IPC, on charges of causing death due to negligence or rashness. The bail for this section is a mere Rs 950. And even if the courts find him guilty, all he needs to serve is two years in prison. This is the law.So Salman Khan, having deposited a paltry Rs 950 as bail amount, is a free man. Free to walk around, and even drive his car again. As did Puru, son of late actor Raj Kumar, nine years ago, when, on New Yearâ€™s eve, his car mowed down five pavement dwellers, killing three and crippling one.This is so, because, in the eyes of the law, the intent to kill wasnâ€™t there. In the hierarchy of crime, causing death due to negligence is several rungs lower than even an attempt to murder, for in the latter, there is an intent, explains lawyer and human rights activist P A Sebastian.Legal experts feel that a review and amendment of laws such as these are long overdue. Incidentally, under 304 A, just about any case of negligence could be booked â€” from construction workers falling off a scaffolding to doctors messing up with a surgery.Under the Motor Vehicles Act, there are provisions to deal with driving under the influence of alcohol, but even here, the maximum punishment is just three years in jail, admits Salman Khanâ€™s lawyer Waris Pathan. Vakil says, â€˜â€˜A rash driver knows the consequences of his act, but feels he can get away with it.So even though there is no intent of crime, the knowledge that the act can harm or kill is there. And we need separate laws to deal with this.â€™â€™ He notes that stringent laws also have a deterrence value.",MUMBAI
