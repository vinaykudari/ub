0,Milk poured on street in protest against policy,"SOLAPUR: Milk producers from Solapur district poured thousands of litres of milk in front of the district collectorate here on Monday in protest against the state governmentâ€™s â€˜discriminatory policyâ€™ on milk acceptance.

Solapur district milk producersâ€™ association president Manohar Dongre pointed out that the government dairy in Mumbai was accepting 90 per cent of the milk produced in Marathwada and Vidarbha regions while only 20 per cent of the produce was being accepted from Solapur and western Maharashtra region.

But in the last 10 days, the administration had totally refused to accept milk from the district. The association produces 3.80 lakh litres of milk every day. Payments for the last two months have also been delayed, he added.

Addressing the members at the district collectorate, Dongre said that there was no uniformity in milk collection in the state as the government had issued separate orders for each district. He said that the milk producers will have to shut their business if the government did not change its â€œdiscriminatoryâ€� policy.

Solapur ranks second in the state in milk collection. The district had a share of Rs 17 crore in the state governmentâ€™s total milk payment dues of Rs 35 crore, Dongre said.

Solapur zilla parishad president Narayan Khandagale has extended his support to the agitation. Speaking at the meet, he demanded resignation of dairy development minister Anandrao Devkate over what he termed as the wrong policies.

1,It's our duty to topple DF govt: Thackeray,"MUMBAI: Even as Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray paraded 144 MLAs in the 288-member assembly before the media on Monday, the Sena-BJP combine received a severe setback. The Bombay HC dismissed as premature petitions filed by three rebel NCP MLAs challenging the show cause notices served on them by Speaker Arun Gujarathi.

The notices were issued for the disqualification of these MLAs. Petitions moved on Monday by two other MLAs who have defected to saffron combine were also dismissed.

In another development, the CPM, which has two MLAs, declared its support to the Demoratic Front (DF) government. The Peasants and Workersâ€™ Party (PWP), with its five MLAs, may follow suit. Should Gujrathi disqualify the five MLAs from the assembly before the vote of confidence on June 13, the saffron allianceâ€™s strategy to pull down the Democratic Front (DF) government will hit a roadblock. Gujarathi will give a hearing to the defector MLAs on Tuesday.

Thackeray on Monday exhorted the Shiv Sena-BJP and rebel Democratic Front MLAs to dislodge the Vilasrao Desmukh ministry. ""It is your duty to topple the DF government and offer an efficient regime to the people of Maharashtra,"" the Sena chief said.

The attendance of 144 MLAs held at a Bandra hotel triggered speculation about the saffron combineâ€™s numerical strength to bring down the 31-month old DF government in a trial of strength in the assembly on June 13. Last week, the Sena-BJP bigwigs had claimed that they had 152 MLAs on their side.

""We will not reveal all our cards at this juncture. We are watching the DF governmentâ€™s next move,"" leader of the opposition Narayan Rane told reporters after the meeting. Asked whether disqualification of several rebel DF MLAs would affect the saffron combineâ€™s number game, senior BJP leader Gopinath Munde said, ""Even if some are disqualified the Sena-BJP combine will be able to rustle up the magical figure.""

2,VSNL to review Tata Tele investment,"NEW DELHI: Tata-managed VSNL agreed on Monday to study and decide the quantum of investment to be made in Tata Teleservices Ltd (TTSL), ending the two week long controversy over VSNLâ€™s decision to invest up to Rs 1,200 for 20-26 per cent stake in TTSL, over the next four years.VSNLâ€™s agreement with the department of telecom (DoT) on Monday actually further expands the scope of a committee that was to look into the details of the investment.

Last Tuesday, VSNL had agreed to enhance the scope of the committee but that did not fully satisfy DoT because the five-point terms of reference put forward then did not include the study of the valuation of TTSL, based on which the investment decision was made by VSNL board on May 28.

Sources close to the negotiations said the companyâ€™s decision to allow the committee to ""study and decide the quantum and the valuation/price at which the investment will be made by VSNL in TTSL at various points of time,"" was a major development, ending the row between the government and the recently disinvested VSNL.

Replying after a week to Guptaâ€™s last Tuesdayâ€™s letter, DPS Seth, DoTâ€™s member (services), said on Monday that the committee should complete deliberations on the issue by August 15. He directed that YS Bhave, the government director on VSNL board, be on the committee. VSNL CMD SK Gupta wrote back to Seth on Monday itself saying that the company will now ""proceed to circulate the resolution(s) as per your suggestion.""

Sources said the ""circular resolution(s)"" would take into consideration all the discussions and developments since the board decision and serve as a preamble for the committee. In February, Tatas bought 25 per cent stake in VSNL for Rs 1,491 crore.

Tatas picked up another 20 per cent stake through an open offer, shelling out about an additional Rs 1,100 crore.

On May 28, VSNL board announced the investment decision and it was strongly contested by communications minister Pramod Mahajan on various counts, including quantum, destination and timing of the investment as well as the transparency of the board decision.

3,Tiwari should be expelled from party: Dadan,"PATNA: Minister of state for commercial taxes Dadan â€˜Pahalwanâ€™ Yadav has done what he had been prohibited from doing by RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav: criticise publicly excise minister and partyâ€™s spokesperson Shivanand Tiwari.

In a press note issued by Pahalwan on Monday, he has accused Tiwari of trying to defame Laloo and chief minister Rabri Devi from within the party. He has held Tiwari responsible for the controversy created during the mega marriage of the chief ministerâ€™s daughter. He maintained that the controversy over forceful lifting of cars from showrooms was â€œmanipulatedâ€� by Tiwari.

Tiwariâ€™s statement, which appeared in the media, describing Laloo as a man who revelled in controversies was a dangerous one, Dadan has pointed out, and added that Laloo has always been dragged into controversies with political motivation.

â€œLaloo never wants to get into controversies,â€� Dadan stated, pointing out that Tiwariâ€™s statement had encouraged political opponents to create a controversy over the presence of Laloo at the meeting between the chief minister and the Patna High Court Chief Justice.

He claimed that he had verified from automobile dealers that they had denied cars were forcefully lifted from their showrooms. He charged Tiwari with taking the help of railway minister Nitish Kumar in getting the chairman of the Tata Group to meet the PM on the issue and defame the state government.

Dadan maintained that while Tiwari hailed from Bhojpur, he always dabbled in the politics of Buxar, and swore that he would not allow Tiwari to succeed politically in Buxar. He stressed that persons like Shivanand Tiwari should be expelled from the RJD.

The open criticism of Tiwari by Dadan is being perceived within the ruling party as an indication of the growing isolation of Tiwari from 1, Anne Marg, where he is no longer a frequent visitor and has preferred to keep a low profile.

Even while the RJD was finally defending Laloo in the controversy last Sunday, Tiwari was not around. The RJD leaders were unaware that Baba, as he is popularly called, had already sent a separate press release flaying Modi on the same account.Though officially RJD leaders continue to mantain that Tiwari was an honoured minister of the cabinet and also their leader, many of them are also wondering if the days of Tiwari in the RJD are numbered.

4,"Police detains Akalis, foils protest plan","AMRITSAR: The police on Monday detained 33 workers of the Shiromani Akali Dal SAD) near the border village of Valtoha while they were on way to Chandigarh to protest against Punjab governmentâ€™s failure to arrest irrigation minister Gurchet Singh Bhullar in the murder of SAD leader Gurdial Singh Sidhu and others.

Those arrested include former member of Punjab subordinate services selection board Virsa Singh Valtoha and many of his supporters.

They were arrested in apprehension of breach of peace under Sections 107 and 151 of the CrPC. Official sources said about 90 SAD workers, including women, were on their way to Chandigarh in a bus when they were intercepted by a police party.

While the women were let off, the rest were arrested. Sidhu, who unsuccessfully contested the February nine assembly polls against Bhullar, was shot dead along with five others in Bhikhiwind town on May 19.

5,Cong heading for big win in Zilla polls,"CHANDIGARH: Preliminary trends in the just-concluded polling to local bodies in Punjab indicate that the Congress is in for a massive win even as the counting of votes continued at a slow pace and results kept trickling in.

â€˜â€˜The win for the Congress is not due to its unearthing of scams in the state but due to people voting in favour of a party which is already in power. The feeling is that one should go along with a ruling party as this will be beneficial for development works and the like,'''' a senior bureaucrat associated with the election process said.

The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), on Monday, once again complained to the state election authorities about alleged irregularities in the poll process.

On Sunday, SAD leader Manpreet Badal had complained to the state election commission about â€˜â€˜riggingâ€� at various places, and on Monday former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal in his complaint mentioned four of these places again.

â€˜â€˜The commission has had these complaints checked from election observers and it has been found that in these four places â€” Buttarbhakhua, Madir, Husnar and Kotli â€” there were no irregularities. In his letter, Badal added two more places, Chak Duhewala and Bhaliana. The complaints with regard to these two places are being verified and the reports of the observers will be in on Tuesday,â€� sources said.

6,Chaos mars IMA State body polls,"KANPUR: Elections to the state body of the Indian Medical Association have sparked off a fresh controversy with two rival groups levelling charges against each other .

These groups have accused each other of misleading Indian Medical Association members and creating a chaos over the election issue.

While AK Srivastava still claimed himself to be the state president of the Indian Medical Association, member of the all-India working committee Nayeem Hamid said Srivastava had no right to continue on the post as the tribunal formed by the national body of the association had given a judgment against him .

Hamid said that the tribunal had instructed the state unit of the Indian Medical Association to conduct fresh elections within 30 days and the time limit given by the tribunal was already over .

On the other hand, honorary secretary Rajesh Agarwal and state president A K Srivastava claimed that they had not received any tribunal order regarding the fresh elections. They alleged that T N Singh, who had lost the IMA elections held in June last year, was unnecessarily creating controversy over the issue .

Srivastava said that the tribunal had stayed the elections and according to last order, he had every right to continue as the state president of the Indian Medical Association. He alleged that some dejected association members were issuing baseless statements over the election issue.

Meanwhile, Hamid told Times News Network that he had already apprised the headquarter of the ongoing controversy over the issue and the delay made by the present state body of the association in conducting fresh elections.

7,Employment top on minister’s agenda,"RANCHI: Forest projects with emphasis on generating employment for villagers tops the agenda of the Jharkhand minister for forest and environment, Yamuna Singh.

Singh said here recently that in 2001-2002, the tree plantation projects generated employment of 52.82 lakh mandays and cost the department Rs 62.13 crore. The minister said tree plantation offers work to unskilled workers and that too quite close to their respective villages.

The minister''s decision to resume cutting of bamboos in December, 2000, also benefited the villagers. In the Latehar forest division, the villagers received Rs 24.63 lakh as wages and the Jharkhand government also earned Rs 62.75 lakh by selling off bamboos.

Similarly, by cutting 13 coups of bamboos in Chatra and Latehar, the villagers received Rs 46.16 lakh as wages and the department earned Rs 87.87 lakh.

And, under the World Food Programme, Singh said, labourers would get 2.50 kg of wheat and 200 gm of lentil (dal) in lieu of Rs 7 as contribution from their daily wages. That is, against a contribution of Rs 7, they will get food items worth Rs 20 at the market rate. And the labourers'' contribution would go to the labour welfare fund.

Singh also stated that 2,799 trees were felled while widening the National Highway 2, and the department got 3,700 cubic metres of timber in the process.

And to make up the loss of tree cover, the National Highway Authority has given Rs 74.91 lakh to the Dhanbad forest division for planting trees by the roadside between Barakar and Barwadda.

Similarly, to make up the losses caused by the felling of 537 trees in Ranchi for widening of roads, the forest department planted 12,000 trees in 2001-2002.

8,Vacant UPCC chief's post ails party,"LUCKNOW: Congressmenâ€™s perpetual quest for a suitable candidate to head the Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee has cast its shadow on the functioning of the party.

The party, which was in upbeat mood after commendable performance in the bypolls and municipal elections in some states, slumped into a state of inertia.

The complete rout of its candidates in the four byelections, held on May 31, has exposed the organisational weaknesses of the party.

The Congress candidates not only forfeited their security deposits on all the seats it contested but, on Bareilly assembly seat, a rebel Congressman polled more votes than the official candidate.

The Congress Party not only lost Akbarpur Lok Sabha and Jehangirganj, Baheri (in Bareilly) and Dibai assembly seats but its vote percentage also went down).

After the rout in the bypolls UPCC president SP Jaiswal put in his papers. But this has not influenced the central leadership in any way and there is no word who will head the organisation in the state.

The central leadership has fixed June 20 for a discussion on Uttar Pradesh unit of the party. Any decision on the UPCC chief could be expected only after that, said Akhilesh Pratap Singh on Monday.

The coordination committee announced by Motilal Vora, incharge of Uttar Pradesh, in the party did not enthuse the partymen. Rather, said a Congressman, it gave a fillip to group rivalry. The committee was announced to oversee the functioning of the party till there was no president. But this further increased the chasm, said a partyman.

Congress president Sonia Gandhi, during her visit to Amethi early this month, had admitted that the Congress did not have a leader of mass base in Uttar Pradesh. According to her, the other reason for the poor show of the party in Uttar Pradesh was less time given by the UPCC chiefs in the state, said a party leader. For the past seven years the UPCC chiefâ€™s post had been held by those who preferred to run the organisation from Delhi.

While some of them had been able to devote sufficient time for the organisation, others kept on making periodical visits only to buttress their support base, said a partyman.

Commenting on the poor state of the Congress, a former UPCC chief had said in the early nineties that the Congressâ€™s prospects would not improve unless the central leadership left the affairs in the hands of homegrown leaders.

9,Geelani’s arrest may derail J&K poll process,"NEW DELHI: In politics, timing is everything. Even by the tardy standards of Indian law enforcement, it is hard to believe that the Kashmir police and income-tax authorities have only now stumbled upon evidence that hardline Hurriyat leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani had less than innocent connections with terrorists and extremists in Pakistan.

The decision to move against him and invoke the Prevention of Terrorism Act (Pota) is not because the government believes lives will be lost if he is not imprisoned immediately but to ensure that he does not exert any political influence during the Kashmir assembly elections, which must be held before October 9. Under Pota, he can be jailed without bail for a minimum of six months. But while the aim of limiting Mr Geelaniâ€™s political influence is laudable, jailing him may not be the most effective way of accomplishing the task as he will definitely call for a boycott of the assembly elections.

Besides, his arrest means that the governmentâ€™s initiative to get a section of the Hurriyat to contest the elections has come to an abrupt end. No separatist leader or former militant can risk courting public charges of flirting with elections at a time when Mr Geelani is under arrest.

If Hurriyat leader A G Loneâ€™s murder by militants squeezed the moderates from one side, Mr Geelaniâ€™s arrest is squeezing them from the other. Given a choice between the fear of â€˜martyrdomâ€™ and the taint of â€˜treacheryâ€™, most will prefer to stay away from the polls. Rather than isolating Mr Geelani by political initiatives which would drive a wedge between the pro-Pakistan firebrand and others and create a space for moderate elements to emerge, the Centre has succeeded in giving him greater political legitimacy. The Kashmiri politicians who were eager to distance themselves from Mr Geelani have now been forced to rally around him.

Although Kashmiris resent the manner in which Mr Geelani has prospered ever since militancy began, they are equally critical of the other Hurriyat leaders. Since virtually all of them are known to be living beyond their known sources of income, the corruption charge against just Mr Geelani will only invite charges of double standards against the government.

In the past too, the Centre has allowed its hatred of Mr Geelani to get the better of its sense of political judgment.

10,Cong rally on panchayats demands,"GANDHINAGAR: An impressive 5,000-strong Congress-sponsored panchayat representatives'' rally here on Monday put forward the demand for decentralisation and financial independence.

Even as the demands were being placed, the rallyists who had gathered three kilometres from the Sachivalaya complex were mildly lathi-charged as they tried to break the prohibitory orders beyond the open ground near Pathik Ashram after knowing that the CM was not conceding to their demands. Those who addressed the rally included senior leaders Amarsinh Chaudhdary, Sharkersinh Vaghela and Shaktisinh Gohil, among others.

""For 2002-03, a mere Rs 1,385.89 crore, or 4.58 per cent, of the total budget of Rs 30,269.72 crore has been allocated for panchayat spending,"" said leader of the Opposition in the state Assembly Naresh Raval.

Raval said, ""The total budget amount for panchayats has been going down over the years. It was 11.61 per cent in 1998-99. This went down to 11.27 crore in 1999-2000 and further eroded to a mere 6.3 per cent in 2001-02."" He charged the BJP rulers of not giving enough independence to the panchayats because they are all Congress ruled.

Organised by the Gujarat State Panchayat Parishad, nearly 25 representatives of district panchayats led by its chief, Kishore Taviad, submitted a 13-point memorandum to the CM, only to be told that the state is in ""a financial crisis"" and they would have to ""bear with it"". This was in response to the demand that Rs 700 crore worth of unpaid bills for 2001-02 to the panchayats be ""cleared immediately"".

The memorandum said that the yearly central grant of Rs 70 crore for panchayats was not being released meticulously. For the last two years, only Rs 100 crore of a total of Rs 140 crore was released. The Gujarat Finance Commission had recommended extra financial powers in its report dated March 26, 1998. However, it has not been implemented yet. Nor is there any attempt to form a separate commission to look into how to fund the panchayats as is the case in several other states.

State finance minister Nitin Patel denied that funds were not being released to the panchayats. ""We are doing whatever can be done by releasing the grants in accordance with the budget,"" said Patel. He, however, refused to divulge the details. Sources in his department said that for the Rs 700 crore worth of pending bills, a mere Rs 100 crore was released in two months, and this too after a special permission was granted to transfer all pending payments in the district and taluka panchayats'' ghost accounts called PLA in the third week of May.

11,NHRC keeps mum on govt response to report,"NEW DELHI: The National Human Rights Commission on Monday decided not to publicly respond to the Gujarat government''s reply to its confidential report ""since it does not add substantially to the earlier reports received from the government of Gujarat"".

But the commission did say that it was ""deeply disturbed by recent press reports that the charge-sheets filed thus far in respect of the Gulbarg Society and Naroda Patia incidents lack credibility in as much as they are reported to depict the victims of violence as the provocateurs"".

The NHRC has decided to wait for a reply from the Gujarat government to its proceedings of May 31 when it had made its final report public as well as released the confidential report. The commission had given the state government time till June 30 to reply. ""Upon receiving the reply the commission will consider the nature of any further comments that it may wish to make in regard to the situation in Gujarat,"" the NHRC said.

According to the commission, after its May 31 report was sent to Gujarat''s chief secretary, the commission received a faxed reply to the confidential report.

15,PWP decision on support to DF govt today,"MUMBAI: Peasants and Workers Party (PWP), whose withdrawal of support to the DF government had triggered a political crisis in Maharashtra, on Tuesday began its crucial meeting to take a final decision on the party''s stand during the trial of strength on June 13.

PWP''s five members in the 288-member state assembly would have a decisive say on the fate of the beleaguered Congress-NCP coalition government.

According to party sources, the party''s highest policy making body is meeting at their leader Jayant Patil''s room in the MLAs'' Hostel to formulate ""the final stance of the party.""

Party insiders maintained that two opinions have emerged on the crucial issue with a section toying with the idea of abstaining from voting ""to prevent communal forces take advantage of the situation and snatch power"" while others still insisting on voting against the trust motion.

PWP had withdrawn support on June 2 to protest re-induction of NCP Minister Sunil Tatkare, whom it had alleged of masterminding PWP candidate''s defeat in Raigad Zilla Parishad Chairman''s election, ""in alliance with saffron combine.""

The PWP move precipitated the worst political crisis for the two-and-a-half-year old ruling coalition, as close on the heels of PWP decision, a number of NCP and Congress MLAs announced their withdrawal of support to the Government reducing it to a minority.
