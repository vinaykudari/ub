0,Engg colleges under govt glare,"hyderabad: having cleared the way for establishment of private engineering and medical colleges in the state, the government has now taken up the task of ensuring that these institutes, particularly private engineering colleges, are meeting the required academic standards. the government is of the view that there is no further requirement of engineering colleges in the state and decided to cap it at the present level of 174 colleges. top government sources told the times of india that special teams would be constituted with academicians from within and outside the state and representatives from industry like confederation of indian industry, to take up onsite inspection of all engineering colleges spread across the state. during the first phase, the inspection of about 60-70 colleges, which have already sent out one batch of students, will be conducted by the teams. the teams will analyse the performance of the colleges during the past academic years in terms of infrastructure and the teaching faculty provided by the managements. the colleges will be circulated questionnaires asking them to make their self assessment before the actual inspection. if the colleges are found lacking in providing quality education to the students, the government will take up the matter with the all india council for technical education (aicte) and recommend for withdrawing affiliation to the colleges concerned, if necessary, chairman for council for higher education prof c subba rao said. the government will not hesitate to reduce the number of courses in the colleges which fail to fulfil the quality standards and requirements. this exercise is expected to commence from december and will be made mandatory. the government feels that after establishing large number of engineering colleges, top priority should be given for ensuring quality education. the government has received feed back from different sources that many engineering colleges had failed to provide basic infrastructure to the students and did not engage even qualified faculty. there are cases where in, the final year engineering students were asked to take up classes for the first year.

1,‘Govt can’t arm-twist NHRC on terror law’,"hyderabad: despite its opposition to the controversial prevention of terrorism ordinance (poto), the national human rights commission, being an independent and autonomous body, feels that the question of government exerting pressure on it to toe the official line does not arise. nhrc member and former supreme court judge k ramaswamy in an interview with the times of india here on sunday said,nobody would dare touch us as far as its opposition to poto is concerned.the nhrc would take an independent view of poto. according to justice ramaswamy, who is in the city to chair a meeting against child labour, the government has so far refrained from exerting pressure on the commission to nullify its opposition to the bill. earlier, the nhrc had unanimously opposed poto on the ground that existing laws in the country are sufficient to counter terrorist threats. justice ramaswamy, a native of andhra pradesh, retired as a supreme court judge in 1997. he was made a member of the nhrc in 1998. the commission had also observed that the poto may turn out to be as draconian as terrorist and disruptive activities prevention act 1987 (tada), and might lead to persecution of innocent citizens by vested officials in the police or the defence services. drawing a parallel between tada and poto, justice ramaswamy cited a case in punjab in which the petitioner had challenged the validity of the tada. after hearing the arguments in the case (kartar singh vs state of punjab), justice ramaswamy, who was a member of the bench which heard the case, dissented with the majority opinion that confessions recorded by the police be made admissible in court.the poto in the form presented so far also allows such confessions made before the police admissible in the court of law.this might encourage the police to torture innocent citizens to extract confessions out of them, justice ramaswamy warned. according to justice ramaswamy, the commission will meet this week in new delhi and present its opinion after perusing changes made in poto. these changes, as announced by the home minister, are subsequent to the commission's criticism that there was no need to enact the poto bill, 2000.

2,Lalla's arrest stayed,"lucknow: even as the district police gave a long rope to bjp mla from colonelganj ajay pratap singh alias lalla bhaiyya and did not arrest him in connection with the alleged murder of his driver satish in which he has been named as accused, the mla on saturday got a stay order from the high court on his arrest till the next hearing slated for november 11. satish had suffered gunshot injuries at the gomtinagar residence of lalla bhaiyya during the intervening night of september 6 and 7 last. after being admitted to three hospitals, he finally died at the kgmc on september 24. after his death, his father shatrughan lal lodged an fir with the gomtinagar police accusing lalla bhaiyya of murder. despite a named fir, lalla bhaiyya remained scot-free till he got a stay on his arrest on saturday. meanwhile, sources said that lalla bhaiyya was also trying to exert pressure on family members of satish to take back the charges of murder levelled against him. the associates of mla are also learnt to have offered rs 2 lakh as financial relief to satish's family. the final outcome of the offer was yet to be known. interestingly, the police had failed to arrest lalla bhaiyya all this while even though he managed to apply before the lucknow bench of high court and procure a stay. sources said the bjp mla had pulled political strings to keep the police away. in the meantime, he had put up hurdles in police investigations by trying to get the medical reports of satish tampered. tampering of reports came to the fore when the police approached the doctors who had treated satish. the police sources said that some of the doctors even refused to hand over the medical report in the absence of any court order to this effect.

3,JD (S) gets clean chit in Malegaon riots case,"mumbai: the lokshahi hakk sanghatana and the committee for the protection of democratic rights have given a clean chit to janata dal (secular) president nihal ahmed in connection with the recent communal riots in malegaon. the two ngos had sent a team to the powerloom town near nashik to investigate the riots. the ``fact finding report'' released by these ngos blames the police categorically for manhandling a youth first and later opening fire. about 2.15 p.m. on october 26, some youths outside jama masjid in malegaon were distributing handbills in urdu which said ``be indian buy indian.'' though there was nothing objectionable about the contents of the handbill, the srp constables seized a copy from a boy near the jama masjid and dragged him towards their van. this led to protest from others coming out of the mosque after their prayers. the imam of the masjid, mufti mohammed ismail, tried to disperse the crowd along with superintendent of police suresh ahire and dsp r.k. rathod. in the melee, a navratri pandal put up nearby got damaged. ``the police then lathicharged the crowd and chased them out of the jama masjid area. the crowd responded by pelting stones at the police. even as the crowd was chased out, about 50-odd hindus, led by an activist of the pro-shiv sena janata raj organisation, staged a demonstration to protest against the damage to the pandal. their numbers swelled and violence broke out. the police opened fire without provocation, the report says. reports that three persons had been killed in police firing spread quickly and soon, `azaans' were being called from mosques all through the evening and the night. though `azaans' are normally used for calling the devout for prayers at mosques, in times of emergencies they are called to give succour to the people. apart from 12 persons killed in police firing, one hindu and one muslim were murdered in the riots. the report claims that the police did not stop the rioters marching under the banner of the `janata raj'. the six-member team which prepared the report visited the riot-affected areas of malegaon, the relief camps in satana town and the affected nearby villages of patne ajang, wadner, nampur, talavde and antapur. says secretary of the lokshahi hakk sanghatana, anthony samy, ``nobody has talked of this chronology, that it was the pro-sena janata raj which made the situation riot-prone. then, there were lot of rumours about women being raped. but our team found no evidence of this.'' mr samy says there was a major exodus of muslims from the seven villages which had no history of riot. ``these people are now living in lanes and by lanes of nearby towns in neglect. the condition of the thousands who fled the place following the communal conflagration needs to be highlighted.'' in a brief study of the deeper psychological malaise, the report says malegaon has a muslim population of 6.5 lakhs of which 70 per cent are muslims. most of them are ansari muslims who are weavers. the others are dakhani muslims, who speak marathi. ninety per cent of powerlooms in malegaon are owned by ansari muslims but the loom workers are mainly dakhani muslims and hindus from nearby villages like soyegaon and dyanegaon. the traders in malegaon are usually gujaratis and marwaris who supply raw materials to loom owners and buy finished products from them. the economic slump has had its impact on the powerloom industry which now operates only up to 50 per cent now. for the past eight months, says the report, this has caused a schism between the hindus and the muslims, with each community believing the other to be responsible for its problems.

4,"37 laws, crores of rupees fail to protect child's rights","pune: the figures are stark and depressing. as many as 37 laws have been passed in our country to protect children's rights and yet we have 11.20 crore child labourers and 4.50 lakh child prostitutes. over 100 crore rupees are spent annually to improve the lives of disadvantaged children, with no visible results. these stark and depressing facts were highlighted by representatives of non-governmental organisations and government agencies on sunday at a public hearing on the rights of the child. the programme was organised by the shikshan hakka abhiyan, an umbrella organisation of ngos working among child-labourers. the difficulties inherent in getting children out of the labour force was articulated by some of the children themselves. one speaker said that a powerful way to stop children being employed was for the public to stop patronising establishments that employ children. don't get your shoes polished by a shoeshine boy, for example. the opposition came from the boy himself. ""if you don't let us polish your shoes, what will we eat?"" asked 13-year-old raju who earlier worked as a waiter at a dhaba before becoming a shoeshine boy. and there were many stories like raju's. eleven-year-old raja works in a brick kiln because his father is no more and his mother is sick all the time. twelve-year-old wajid shaikh works in a hotel because his father does not earn enough to support his family of nine children. it is obvious that policies need to be put in place to ensure these children do not have to work, but the government has failed to come up with anything remotely like one despite all the laws it has passed. the children present asked for very little. not posh schools or toys. nitin yavkar declared he would be happy if the teacher at the night school he attends turned up on time, and taught them instead of playing cards with fellow teachers, or remains in the class rather than disappears right after taking attendance. kavita, who works as a housemaid, wants decent meals twice a day and some time to play. while everybody was expressing serious concern about child labourers, ramchandra patil, labour commissioner claimed child labour was on the decline and that a recent survey of hazardous industries did not reveal a single case of child labour! he accepted though that often child labourers were temporarily shifted, when owners of these establishments realised a survey was on. madhav kukade, registrar, state human rights commission wondered how employers came to know of such surveys in advance. he said that even when there were enough laws to prevent child labour, they cannot be effectively implemented due to increasing interference. he informed the gathering that although rs 100 crore was spent on providing food and shelter to these children, the food was often unpalatable. he felt that agencies that were involved in implementing government schemes must be scrutinised to check whether the money given to them was being used properly.

6,Drug industry urges govt for speedy pricing policy,"mumbai: the drug industry has urged the government to expedite introduction of the modified pricing policy on drugs as any further delay will have serious and negative impact on the industry which in turn will affect the consumers. the industry recommended that the taxes and duties, currently amounting to 38 per cent of the price, should be reduced to 20 per cent, indian drug manufacturers' association president n h israni told reporters here on saturday. about 74 drugs are in the price control list and it should be brought down considerably, he said. the new drug policy, under discussion for the last two years, is scheduled to come into effect from january 2001, he said. no further delay will be entertained by the industry as it faces stiff challenges in the years ahead with product patents as envisaged under trade related intellectual property rights agreement (trips) coming into effect from january 2005. the present process patent regime which the industry is enjoying, has enabled indian companies to produece medicines cheaply through alternative routes and ""this will not be possible once the product patents come into effect,"" he added.

9,Tax lawyers fear revenue fall,"new delhi: the adverse trend experienced by traders across the country may further worsen if state governments insist on introducing the much-hyped value added tax (vat), replacing sales tax. concerned at the future of trade in the capital and elsewhere in the country, president of the all india tax advocates forum, m k gandhi, said on saturday that ""vat would add to confusion, thus reducing revenue for the exchequer"". gandhi said vat proposes to shift the burden on small traders who would be compelled to adhere to several procedural requirements. in delhi alone, there are 1.60 lakh sales tax assesses who contribute to the exchequer enormously. but, gandhi feared, vat would be counter productive, as it might encourage tax evasion. the traders might not be able to comply with a plethora of procedural technicalities required under the new system. one provision stipulates imposition of penalty up to rs 5000 on a trader failing to file returns. ""the experience of the assesses covered by vat in different parts of the country have not been very encouraging"", gandhi said, adding:""unless the central sales tax act is withdrawn, vat would not be able to serve any one - consumers, traders and the government"". for the capital which has a distributive character as its business depends on goods manufactured outside delhi, gandhi said, vat would be a disaster.

11,Nitish pacifies sore partymen,"ranchi: union railway minister and senior samata party leader nitish kumar on saturday asked his party's ministers in the jharkhand government to act in a responsible manner. he said they should remember that being a partner in an alliance government they also have some responsibilities. it is not a good practice to publicly air all your grievances, nitish told his ministers, who have been cribbing about the shoddy deal meted out to samata party while forming the nda coordination committee for jharkhand. jharkhand samata president and minister of excise in the jharkhand government ramesh singh munda had said that he and other samata ministers had submitted their resignation letters to nitish kumar as they and their party workers felt that despite being in the government, the samata party was being treated as an outsider and was not being given its due. munda had been aspiring for the nda coordination committee convener's post, which has been given to janata dal (united). the bjp and the jd(u) leaders met nitish kumar on saturday afternoon and had apprised him of the situation. nitish kumar told mediapersons these differences arose out of inexperience: dhire dhire ye log seekh jayenge, samajh jayenge. kumar said that open dialogue should precede any decision and it should not be the other way round. there are many things that can be solved by having a dialogue, he said. he also asked his partymen and the jharkhand government to work for the society rather than follow the bihar example of working only for votes. kumar was here to address a meet of the minorities. he assured the minorities that their rights would be fully protected in jharkhand.. and he asked his party's ministers to address themselves to grievances of the people.

12,"Tribals clash with police, 2 killed","bhubaneswar: two tribals were killed and 11 others, including eight women, injured when police opened fire on a large crowd of tribal demonstrators at raighar in orissa's nabarangpur district on sunday. it was the second such incident in the area in the last two weeks. on october 30, three tribals were killed at rengamati village in police firing. the tribals are on a war-path for quite sometime demanding return of their lands allegedly usurped by bengali settlers. sunday's police firing occurred late in the afternoon when about 8,000 tribals, nearly 4,000 of whom were women, staged a demonstration outside the raighar block office in protest against the october 30 incident. the tribals soon turned violent, ransacked the block office and set it on fire. they also tried to set on fire the raighar police station, but failed due to the timely intervention by the eight platoons of orissa state armed police (osap) deployed in the area. the police initially resorted to lathicharge and burst tear gas shells to drive away the mob. as the situation went out of control, the police opened fire. at least 100 houses, including several government offices and quarters, had been burnt down by the tribals. the entire raighar area had been virtually reduced to ashes, forcing panic-stricken residents to flee the place.

13,Is another terror law needed?,"new delhi: two us supreme court judges recently said here that american laws were good enough to deal with terrorists, including the perpetrators of the september 11 attacks. also, during the trial of an accused, the us courts would keep in mind the legal rights of an individual even if he were a terrorist. one of the judges, justice o'connor, said there was no deficiency in law around the world to deal with terrorists. but in india, perhaps, there is a deficiency — if one believes the government. among the existing laws, apart from the ipc, the arms act, 1959, the explosives act, the explosive substances act, the authorities are equipped with the armed forces (special powers) act, 1958, which empowers the armed forces in disturbed areas to use force against any person who is acting in contravention of any law or order. to forestall hijack attempts and other offences related to civil aviation, the suppression of unlawful activities act has been enacted to support the civil aviation act, 1982. in addition, there are at least four central preventive detention acts and some preventive detention acts enacted by various state governments. the government, however, is still bent upon arming itself with additional laws in the form of prevention of terrorism ordinance (poto). noted lawyer and law minister arun jaitley says india needs such a law, considering the risk from international terrorist groups. but for tada, he says, the conviction of rajiv gandhi's assassins would not have been possible. the supreme court, however, ruled that the assassination of rajiv gandhi was not an act of terrorism or a disruptive activity. thus, the accused were not held guilty under tada but under indian penal code and the arms act. poto has found another champion in minister for disinvestment arun shourie, who feels that 130-year-old laws are not stringent enough. increasing terrorist threats may be a valid reason for installing poto, but to say it would effectively fill the lacunae of existing laws would be incorrect. ""one can combat terrorism under the constitution and existing laws,"" said national human rights commission chairman j s verma. poto, fears verma, would unintentionally provide room for gross misuse and violation of human rights. if the purpose of poto is to ensure speedy trial and secure convictions, which may not be possible under the existing criminal justice system, then the government must gear up its investigating and prosecution machineries. the problem cannot be solved by providing a different and more drastic procedure for prosecution of certain crimes — making confessions before the police admissible in evidence contrary to the provisions of the evidence act, and creating special courts — as set out in poto, said the nhrc. if requisite measures are not taken to check misuse of poto's clause wherein confessions before a police officer is made admissible in evidence, the possibility of coercion and torture in securing confession would increase manifold. in other words, this would mean violation of rights of an individual.

14,KPTC seeks ordinance to increase power theft punishment,"mysore: v.p. baligar, chairman and managing director of karnataka power transmission corporation (kptc) said, the kptc has recommended to the union government to bring out an ordinance increasing the quantum of punishment against power thefts. this, he said, was the best way to curb the growing power transmission and distribution loss in the state. speaking after inaugurating a seminar on ``plug the leaks'' organised to mark the seventh silver jubilee celebrations here, he said, though kptc has put in best efforts to check power theft, many offenders have got away with it by paying a minimum fine of rs 500 to rs 5,000, while the losses caused by them ran into lakhs. therefore, he said, kptc wants the centre to increase imprisonment from a minimum of three months up to five years for the offenders in power theft cases with a minimum fine of rs 5,000 and a maximum of rs 50,000. in addition, power should be denied to offenders for the next two years. besides, he said, they have also suggested to the government to include energy audit, meter installation programme including bhagyajyothi and kutera schemes to be completed in three years. moreover, he said, strengthening the security staff, transparency in administration with the support of ngos and obtaining information about power theft through the public will be the continued steps towards restricting power theft. the issue of meter readers and linesmen, who at times work in nexus with the certain customers will also be taken up, he added. he said technical audits carried out by kptc revealed that an investment equivalent to rs 150 crore would be needed for every percentage point reduction in pilferage. for carrying out such operation, kptc is expected to tap the financial markets with a debt issue of approximately rs 600 crore in the current financial year. to eliminate losses at the distribution ends, baligar said, kptc has started carrying out area-wise survey of the connected loads to identify load requirements and accordingly begun installation of single-phase transformers. in addition, kptc has also prepared plans to install tamper-proof meters in unmetered facilities. stating that there are approximately 11 lakh irrigation pumpsets in the state, he said, provision would also be made to install meters in the agriculture load facilities. currently, the transmission and distribution losses in the state have been estimated at 35 per cent per year, out of which, 15 per cent loss is due to power theft. technical losses due to defective transmission lines and transformers have been estimated at 20 per cent. commercial losses, which include pilferages and unmetered connections account for the remainder.

""when i had challenged the renewal of tada in the supreme court, the five-member constitution bench had instructed the government to build in six safeguards to prevent its misuse. all these six safeguards have been incorporated in poto,"" jethmalani said. the main safeguard that has been incorporated is the provision of using confession of an accused as evidence. ""in the new act, it has been mentioned that if the accused mentions in court that his confession has been taken after torture, the magistrate must investigate the matter before admitting the evidence,"" jethmalani said. meanwhile, in an interaction organised by maulana shaukat ali foundation to commemorate maulana abul kalam azad's 113th birth anniversary, participants expressed apprehensions in the wake of the us attacks on afghanistan and the introduction of poto. former chief minister of west bengal siddhartha shankar ray flayed the prevention of terrorism ordinance passed by the centre on sunday. he claimed that there were enough laws in the country to fight terrorism and poto was uncalled for. ray was speaking to muslim clerics and intellectuals in the city. ray spoke of his days as the governor of strife-torn punjab and the way he had succeeded in transforming the citizens' attitude towards terrorists. ""the people's problems have to be understood and addressed. the citizens will themselves stop abetting the terrorists. a similar approach is necessary in other parts of the country where terrorism is a problem. then, there will be no need for such draconian laws,"" he said. sayyad ali, who presided over the meeting, said that the only terrorism in kashmir was sponsored by the state. ""it is clearly aggression of a larger nation against a smaller sovereign one,"" he claimed. a number of participants said that simi was not a terrorist organisation but was only propagating islam. another speaker, habibur rahman, however, asked those present to accept that terrorism was a threat to the country. he felt that lack of sufficient representation and social and economic rights was to blame for the menace.
