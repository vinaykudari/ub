0,Dowry victim says in-laws wanted a son,"NEW DELHI: The day Bulandshahr dowry victim Jyoti Chandra was allegedly beaten up and her daughter brutalised was also the day Jyoti''s brother-in-law had a son. Her husband''s family had reportedly demanded Rs 2 lakh which Jyoti had been unable to pay.

Recuperating from her injuries at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), along with her daughter, Jyoti is now inclined to think that the two events might not be completely unrelated.

On January 2, Jyoti and her daughter Shreya (4) were beaten up by her husband Puneet and his family. Puneet bit off chunks of flesh from Jyoti''s cheeks and also a portion of her right index finger. When she escaped and locked herself in a room, he bit their daughter and inserted a car wiper into her body so that now, even after one operation, the child is excreting through her stomach.

Talking to The Times of India, a visibly depressed Jyoti said, ""They wanted a male child and were never too happy with the fact that I had a daughter. May be my husband was so brutal to Shreya not just because he wanted to make me come out of the room. The intention might have been to deliberately harm her so that a ''burden'' was removed from the family.""

While Jyoti started sobbing as she was recounting the brutalities of the people she had called family for the last five years, little Shreya was sleeping blissfully, scarcely aware that her life was never going to be the same again.

Jyoti said, ""I am just worried about Shreya. Several NGOs have been coming to me with offers of financial help. But, all I want is a government job to secure my daughter''s future. I will never go back to that house again, no matter what.""

Union health and family welfare minister Sushma Swaraj had visited Jyoti recently. ""She assured me that she will talk to the UP government about my job. But I am keeping my fingers crossed till something concrete materialises,"" Jyoti said.

2,Police search for ways to handle mob violence,"CHANDIGARH: The police needs to fast find out ways to handle mob violence in populated colonies so that Tuesday''s incidents in which policemen were beaten up in Sector 25 and 61 are not repeated.

All the incidents in which policemen have either got beaten up or found itself pushed to the wall occurred in city''s densely populated colonies or slums.

""It''s like there are two Chandigarhs here. One an urban one and the other in slums. Both require diametrically opposite solutions,"" summed up a senior police officer. ""The social composition is so different in colonies and slums where residents are packed like sardines and most of the youths unemployed that often even small incidents have a tendency to flare up,"" he said.

On the methods to curb the repeat of such incidents, old timers and seasoned police officers see a solution in traditional style of policing.

""Use â€˜lathi'' (stick),"" they suggested. Unless miscreants and other mischief mongers are afraid of the khaki, they will often take liberties with the law. Police need to crackdown on all sorts of crime in slums, be it bootlegging, sale of drugs or petty crimes, only then can the small-time criminal be restrained, they said.

In most cases of mob violence women actively participate and are often used as shields to launch attacks. The only method then available is working in advance so that such situations do not arise. ""Increased patrolling, frequent visits by senior officers, surveillance over bad characters and making preventive arrests will help solve many problems, as these colonies are also becoming crime underbellies of the city,"" said another police officer. These colonies not only are a policing challenge but also require initiatives at the societal level.

""Unless the pent-up energy of these residents, who face a sharp economic divide, is channelised, anyone rubbing them on the wrong side will meet the same fate as these policemen,"" argued another police officer.

Yadav asks DSPs, SHOs to curb violence It was a revision of sorts for the area DSPs and SHOs, as SSP Gaurav Yadav, on Thursday, held a meeting in the wake of two violent incidents in which policemen were injured. Yadav reminded his deputies to of major instructions that have been issued by him. In two separate meetings held for DSPs and then SHOs, they were asked to inform the SSP immediately of crime cases and make preventive arrest to check nuisance and curb violence.

3,Loss of upmarket image mourned,"NOIDA/GHAZIABAD: Even as Ghaziabad celebrated the denotification of Gautam Budh Nagar, Noida mourned the ""end of its cosmopolitan image"". What most residents resent is the association with ""crime-prone, old-world Ghaziabad"".

""Noida in essence is different from Ghaziabad and bandhs usually fail to evoke any response. But this one was almost total which should indicate the level of dissatisfaction,"" said Noida Medicare Centre chief executive Ritu Sood.

She felt that people had started associating a certain snob value with Noida. Others, however, disliked the idea of creating and dissolving districts at whim. ""We have a distinct identity and people should not disturb that unnecessarily,"" opined Kailash Hospital chairman Dr Mahesh Sharma.

There is, however, a positive side to the story. ""The merger of Noida with Ghaziabad will turn it into a fully urban district,"" said a resident. Ghaziabad district magistrate Santosh Yadav has appointed Ghaziabad city additional district magistrate as ""a resident magistrate of sorts in Noida"".

""We will delegate as much work as possible to officials posted in Noida,"" he said.

6,Birds bear the brunt as kites rule the azure skies,"AHMEDABAD/VADODARA/SURAT: While Uttarayan enthusiasts revelled in bringing down the kites of their opponents on Wednesday, little did they know that their lethal ''manjas'', brought dead birds crashing down along with the kites.

According to the records of Animal Health Foundation (AHF) in Ahmedabad, 11 birds were killed, while about a hundred others were maimed on Uttarayan day.

The birds were brought in with torn muscles, ruptured limbs or chopped wings and 90 per cent of them might never be able to fly again.

AHF co-ordinator Rahul Sehgal blames the glass-powder coated ''manjas'' and nylon Chinese strings for the deaths, as they cut right the through the skin of the birds.

In Vadodara, activists reported that the kite mania spared none â€” pigeons, monkeys, goats, kites, parrots egrets and cows were all victims of the deadly ''manja''. The Vadodara Centre for Animal Rescue & Emergency (VCARE) reported at least five cases of injuries to pigeons and parrots, while the Gujarat Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (GSPCA) reported at least a dozen cases of injuries, which resulted in fatalities.

Says Snehal Bhatt of GSPCA, ""We received at last 15 distress calls in one day. We treated five monkeys, two kites, three egrets, three cows and two calves. However, those birds and animals with serious injuries could not be saved. We anticipate casualties throughout the week as the strings continue to dangle from trees and poles.""

""People rushed pigeons on finding us preoccupied with treatment of critical cases. I am happy to say that people are growing more sensitive towards animals,"" adds Bhatt.

In Surat, as many 42 birds â€” pigeons, eagles, crows and others â€” suffered varying degrees of injuries on Wednesday.

Some of these birds are reported to be in critical condition and chances of their being on their wings is almost bleak, according to Darshan Desai of Nature Club which continued receiving calls even on Thursday for rescuing injured birds from various parts of the city. Most cases were from the main city areas like Bhagal, Chowk, Bhatar Road, City Light Area, Rander and other places, Desai told TNN. All rescued birds are being kept at the club for treatment, he said.

7,Development fee issue rocks minority professional colleges,"HYDERABAD: The issue of development fees in minority professional colleges appears to be taking a turn for the worse with the third semester examinations drawing closer.

The minority college managements are sticking to the All-India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) guidelines on collecting development fees from MBA and MCA students.

On the other hand, the students are adamant that they will not pay the fees following an Osmania University notification that the collection of such fees is illegal. Agitations by students and their representations to university authorities since then have become a routine affair.

However, there appears to be no coordination between university authorities, officials of the State Council for Higher Education, Department of Higher Education and Minorities Welfare Department to solve the issue.

The issue needs to be solved with a joint decision of concerned departments. And in the event of a complaint reaching one of these departments, all that the concerned college is receiving is a notice seeking clarifications.

Two years back, the AICTE had prescribed Rs 9,000 and Rs 4,000 as development fees for MBA and MCA courses in the payment and free seat categories respectively.

But in a notification dated August 31, 2002, and then again on November 6, 2003, the Osmania University asked colleges not to collect more than Rs 24,750 per annum from MBA students and Rs 17,700 from MCA students.

As there are no free seats in MBA or MCA, all colleges collected Rs 9,000 as development fees. Following the OU directive, students are not only refusing to pay the fees for the current year but are also demanding that the fees paid in the previous year be adjusted against this year''s tuition fees.

Recently, the Minorities Welfare Department issued a notice to an institution warning against the fee collection, while the Osmania University issued a show cause notice to another against harassing students for the same.

During the past two months, classes are not being held properly in most of the minority colleges due to the ongoing crisis.

13,HC questions confiscation of buses for Sonia rally,"BATHINDA: Sonia Gandhi came Bathinda on Thursday and left, recharging the party workers and leaders for the forthcoming Lok Sabha elections. But the large-scale arrangements made to receive Sonia and put an impressive gathering at the rally has left the district transport authorities sulking.

The Punjab and Haryana High Court has directed the district transport officer (DTO) and station house officer (SHO) Civil Line police station Bathinda to appear in the court on January 22 to explain the alleged confiscation of a mini bus of a private transporter.

Following a writ petition by Jagdish Puri, a transport of Moga, alleging illegal seizure of his bus by DTO Bathinda for ferrying Congress party workers to attend party rally, the High Court had appointed a warrant officer on January 14 who raided the DTO office Bathinda late evening on Wednesday and recovered the impounded bus, parked in front of the police station and district administration complex here.

On the oral directions of the Punjab government, hundreds of private buses were rounded up by the district transport authorities over the state to ferry Congress party workers to Bathinda from all corners of the state. The party had fixed a target of reaching one lakh people in the rally.

The transporters were reportedly directed to send their vehicles, buses and trucks, to the offices of DTOs in their respective districts a day before the rally.

Jagdish Puri had reportedly declined to comply with the directions of the DTO and the latter rounded up his bus, plying between Nihal Singh Wala and Bhagta Bhai town, on January 13 and taken all its documents in his possession. Aggrieved at the DTOâ€™s alleged illegal action, Puri approached the High Court.

Sucha Singh Mast, DTO Bathinda declined of impounding the bus belonging to Puri. He said that he did not know who brought the bus here. The civil line police authorities also declined of recovery of the bus by the WO from its custody. The bus was not recovered from police station premises, said the police authorities.

In his deposition to the WO, the driver of the bus also reportedly blamed the DTO for seizing of the bus and its papers.

Despite denial by the DTO of confiscating the bus, the authorities admitted in private of impounding about 1700 truck and buses over the state to ferry the people to the rally. ""It is an open secret but still officially we can''t admit it"", said a senior officer here.

The transporters are anguished with the transport authorities for targeting only the small transporters who own one to three buses. Be it in Akalis or Congress regime, for every rally our buses and trucks are impounded, never the buses of big transporters for these being owned by political leaders, said a transporter here, having two mini buses.

Badal and Avtar Henry are two biggest transporters of the state but never their buses are pressed into service of ferry people in their own rallies, he said.

15,Lukewarm response to Cong rally,"KANGRA: The much-hyped public meeting of Himachal Pradesh Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh held in the campus of Tanda Medical College in the Nagrota Bagwan Assembly segment of Kangra district represented by the state transport minister on Friday lacked enthusiasm among the general public as most of the gathering included school children government employees working in various departments and Congress workers.

The presence of general public was far less in the rally as the school children and government employees outnumbered them

The Chief Minister of Himachal Pradesh, Virbhadra Singh, while addressing the gathering alleged that the previous BJP government indulged in vote-politics during its five-year tenure and did nothing for the progress of the state.

He said that development had come to a grinding halt during the previous government and as a result the state did not make any forward movement in terms of progress.

The Chief Minster said that it was his government, which had opened this college adding that it would be made a medical institution of excellence.

He added that his government was committed to provide quality health services to the people of the state and keeping this in view, the construction of the 500-bedded hospital in the Tanda Medical College was underway with half of the work had been completed. Besides this he said that there was a capacity of about 900 beds in other health institutions of the state, which could cater to the health needs of the people of the state.

The Chief Minster said that super specialty Swami Vivekanand Hospital being constructed at Palampur had been allotted a prime land of crores of rupees by the previous Congress government headed by him.

He also criticised the BJP for ignoring the interests of the other backward classes category. The Chief Minster said that Shanta Kumar former Chief Minister of Himachal Pradesh had approached the Supreme Court for non-implementation of the Mandal Commissionâ€™s report in the state recommending 27 per cent reservation for the OBCs.

Virbhadra said that it was the previous Congress government headed by him which had raised the reservation quota for OBCs upto 18 per cent in the government jobs.

Virbhadra asserted that his government would have no hesitation to enhance the quota for OBCs up to 27 per cent in the government jobs as and when the report of Backward Commission is received.

The Chief Minster also announced the upgradation of six local schools including two of the primary schools, two middle schools and two high schools. The primary schools were upgraded to middle level, while middle to high and high were upgraded to senior secondary level. The Chief Minster also inaugurated an auditorium, faculty, library block and lift water supply scheme in the premises of the Tanda Medical College amounting to Rs. 24 crores.

16,Virbhadra govt misleading people: Dhumal,"DHARAMSALA: The former Chief Minister of Himachal Pradesh said that various announcements made by Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh regarding uprgradation of schools and health institutions during his current winter sojourn to Dharamsala were nothing but were just meant for misleading the people of state to gain political mileage with an eye on the Lok Sabha polls likely to be held before schedule.

Speaking to the TNN, Dhumal alleged that most of the school and health institutions do not have any budgetary provision.

He said that the previous Congress government headed by Virbhadra Singh in 1998 had made similar announcements before the assembly elections and as a result, the BJP-led government had to face a great deal of financial difficulty in making them functional.

Dhumal also alleged that three of the colleges opened by the previous government in Kangra, Mandi and Sirmaur had been denotified by the present regime merely for political reasons and considerations.

He said that the Congress government has no concern for the people of lower areas. Dhumal said that if the present regime

was so serious about the lower region, why it was reluctant to make an announcement for the construction of the second phase of the Mini Secretariat in Dharamsala.

17,Peeved transport minister leaves function midway,"KOLKATA: A seething West Bengal transport minister Subhas Chakraborty left the police, PWD and the North 24 Parganas district top brass red-faced on Friday morning after he walked off from a function to innagurate a hi-tech signalling system on the VIP Road.

The minister, the functionâ€™s chief guest, was peeved since he was not allowed to speak before others.

The minister had requested to leave early since he had an important meeting at Writersâ€™s Buildings soon after. Even PWD minister Amar Chowdhuryâ€™s words could not pacify him.

Apart from the signalling system, the minister was also to inaugurate the newly constructed service road along the VIP Road from Durgapur Bridge to Bangur Avenue.

The function was slated to start at half past nine and Chakraborty was at the venue on time. After reaching, he requested senior police officers conducting the function to let him off early for the meeting.

""Please finish my involvement in the function quickly, so that I can reach Writers'' Buildings on time for the meeting. Several important issues would be discussed and I have to be present there,"" was the ministerâ€™s request to the organisers.

But, when the programme started, something different happened. The assembled audience and the minister noticed that it was SDPO, Bidhannagar Sujoy Chanda who was conducting the function and not the president of the function, chairman of South Dum Dum Municipality, Srihir Bhattacharya.

Chanda first invited district police super Basudeb Bag to speak. After Bag, the SDPO called the name of South Dum Dum Municipalityâ€™s Congress councillor Mriganka Bhattacharyaâ€™s name for the speech.

At this point of time, a visibly agitated Chakraborty got up, walked down the stage, climbed down the stairs and went straight for his vehicle.

The stunned organisers and the audience first took some time to understand what was happening, but soon senior police officers including the SP and PWD officers rushed to the ministerâ€™s car and requested him to inaugurate the signals. However, Chakraborty left the venue.

At that point of time, PWD minister Amar Chowdhury, Special IG (Headquarters) Narayan Ghosh, IG-Law and Order Chayan Mukherjee, district magistrate of North 24 Parganas H.K. Dwivedi, chief enginner of PWD and chairman of South Dum Dum Municipality Srihir Bhattacharya were on the stage.

A visibly embarrassed district police top brass wrapped up the programme quickly. The signal system at Gholaghata, Lake Town and Bangur Avenue and the service road were inaugurated by the civic chairman and the PWD minister.

However, the plaques placed for the inauguration bore the name of Subhas Chakraborty as the chief guest.

When asked an agitated Srihir Bhattacharya squarely blamed the district police authorities for the mess. ""People who were in charge of the programme were the ones who did the damage. It was definitely embarrassing for us who had no other alternative than to stay on. If this case happened with me, I would have also done the same thing as the minister did"", reacted Bhattacharya.

18,"Noida recovers, violence in parts","NOIDA: For the second consequent day, reports of sporadic violence were received from Noida and neighbouring areas of Dadri, Surajpur and Kasna. Protesters held up traffic, stoned cars in Noida''s phase 2, sector 39 and 49.

Traffic was held up and cars damaged on the Dadri Road. In Noida city, traffic remained thin in the morning, but things started normalising around forenoon when people started venturing out. Most shops remained open.

In the Greater Noida area, however, there were reports of vandalisation from several factories and educational institutions. Ghaziabad district magistrate Santosh Yadav, however, said that Kasna, Kankod, Dankor, Rabupura and Jehangirpur police station areas were all part of the Bulandshahr district now. These were earlier a part of the Gautam Budh Nagar district that was recently denotified.

""Any incidents that may have occurred in the Kasna area are obviously against the transfer to Bulandshahr district and have nothing to do with Ghaziabad,"" said Yadav.

Large mobs were seen squatting along the Dadri Road, especially in Bhangel and Barola area, ready to attack passing vehicles. Many vehicles were attacked with sticks and stones by the protesters who were also seen burning effigies of Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav.

At Dadri, close to the police station hundreds of school and college students joined in the burning of the chief minister''s. They also jammed traffic on national highway 1 for over an hour.

Police, however, claimed there were only ""sporadic incidents of violence along Dadri Road."" Meanwhile, local BJP MP and Union minister of state for communications, Ashok Pradhan and BJP MLA Nawab Singh Nagar said BJP activists were ""not responsible for the violence that occurred on Thursday and Friday"".

Pradhan said the police should take action against anyone indulging in violence, vandalism or blocking traffic. ""We strongly condemn the violence. We will support Noida''s cause democratically,"" he said.

Earlier in the day, Samajwadi Party MLA Madan Chauhan had held the BJP leaders responsible for provoking violence in Noida. ""They led the protesters themselves,"" Chauhan said.

Noida residents, however, heaved a sigh of relief as things got back to normal in most parts of the city. ""We couldn''t shop yesterday because of the violence because of which the shops are slightly crowded today,"" said sector 28 resident Anju Singh. The only form of protest in the main city area on Friday was a dharna at the residence of the former Gautam Budh Nagar district magistrate.
