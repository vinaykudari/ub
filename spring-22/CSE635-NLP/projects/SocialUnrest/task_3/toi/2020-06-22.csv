0,"HC pulls up government, AIIMS for 'negligence'","NEW DELHI: The Delhi High Court has issued notices to the Delhi government and to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences(AIIMS) after hearing a petition seeking compensation for the death of a doctor who died in the hospitalâ€™s swimming pool.

Justice A K Sikri sought a reply â€” on why the compensation demanded in the petition should not be paid â€” before August 5, 2003. The petition filed by a relative of the victim through his counsel Atul Nigam had demanded Rs 57 lakh as compensation. The Delhi government was represented by its counsel Meera Bhatia. The petition alleged that Dr G K Chaubey, who had earlier worked with the Indian navy, died in the students gymkhana swimming pool maintained by AIIMS. The lifeguard was busy watching a cricket match in the nearby TV room. The petition further alleged that illumination was poor at the swimming pool.

The victim, who was the head of the forensic science department at Safdarjung hospital, died on May 26, 1999. At the time of the incident, AIIMS did not have a licence for a swimming pool. The hospital managed to procure one after some time though. The victimâ€™s family had filed an FIR stating that search was initiated for Chaubeyâ€™s body only after his daughter cried for help. The body was found submerged at the deep end of the pool.

The petitioner claimed that the report filed by the AIIMS department of forensic medicine stated that the victim was not suffering from any illness and that his life could have been saved if provided with artificial resuscitation in time. Apparently, there was no life saving apparatus to save people from drowning when the incident took place. Under the swimming pools licensing and controlling regulations, the pool authorities must deploy lifeguards and provide life saving gear.

The petition sought prosecution of Delhi government, AIIMS and the lifeguard, Yashwant Tokas, for negligence and failing in their â€˜â€˜mandatory and statutory duties.â€™â€™

2,Dalits force minister to leave Buta Mandi area,"JALANDHAR: Some Dalit youths on Sunday raised slogans against Punjab technical education minister Mohinder Singh Kaypee and forced the latter to leave the Buta Mandi area here without attending the bhog ceremony to commemorate death of Vijay Kumar, who was killed in alleged police firing on June 5 following outbreak of violence due to the Dalit-Jat clash at Talhan village.

Meanwhile, the Dalit Action Committee and the Punjab BJP alleged that the BSP was behind the â€˜â€˜whole drama to gain political mileage,'''' which, they maintained, was highly deplorable. The incident occurred on Sunday afternoon, when Kaypee along with his supporters reached Buta Mandi, a part of Jalandhar south constituency, he presently represents in the Punjab Vidhan Sabha, to attend bhog ceremony of Vijay Kumar and some Dalit youths raised anti-minister and anti-Congress slogans.

Though the minister tried to resist the moves of these agitated youths and tried to enter the venue, the continued raising of slogans forced the former to ultimately leave the place without attending the bhog ceremony.

Talking to mediapersons, member of Dalit Action Committee Lahori Ram Bali and vice president of state BJP Vijay Sampla condemned the incident and held the BSP responsible for their alleged attempts to gain political mileage out of killing of a Dalit.

4,"Killer disease has no cure, says minister Surjya Kanta","KOLKATA/BANKURA: There is no cure for the disease that killed scores of children in Murshidabad recently.

State health minister Surjya Kanta Misra conceded this on Sunday, while inaugurating a diabetes clinic at the Westbank Hospital in Howrah.

â€œSome results have come from the National Institute of Virology, Pune. In some cases influenza A viruses have been detected,â€� Misra told journalists after the function.

Claiming that the state government had tried its best in Murshidabad, he said, â€œThere is no treatment for this virus. There is no medicine for the disease.â€�

He observed that malnutrition could have aggravated the infection. Most of the affected children were from very poor families. He also said that the situation was now under control.

â€œWe are expecting the final result [of the tests] by June 24. The government is taking all possible steps,â€� the minister said.

Although the state government has taken stern measures against the Murshidabad doctors charged with dereliction of duty, the CPM-backed Association of Health Services Doctors (AHSD) has decided to stand by them.

â€œSome people are trying to gain political advantage by exploiting the incident. They are maligning people purposefully and should not be tolerated by the government,â€� said AHSD secretary Prodyot Sur.

However, Indian Medical Association headquarters joint secretary R.D. Dubey commented, â€œIt clearly underlines the lack of infrastructure at the district level as doctors could not treat or diagnose simple influenza. Nutritional status was also very poor, which shows that family welfare programmes are of little significance.â€�

Meanwhile, a one-year old died and nine children fell ill in Sonamukhi, Bankura, struck by an undiagnosed illness.

District chief medical officer Murali Mohan Das said he was yet to get a report from the BMOH, Sonamukhi.

A team of experts would visit Sonamukhi on Monday, he added.

5,British rule affected lives of fishermen,"PATNA: The advent of the British rule and its gradual advancement up the Gangetic valley brought many changes in the lives of people living there. One of the most affected classes was the fishing community.

There lifestyle was completely transformed during the long colonial rule. This was found out during the recent research undertaken by a senior University Grants Commission fellow, Ashok Anshuman.

Delivering a lecture on ''The Gangetic fishing community: The colonial experience'', at the K P Jayaswal Research Institute, he said that on account of colonial revenue policies, a sea change was noticed in the lives of fishermen living along the course of Ganga.

The other factor which had a visible impact on their lives was growth in the field of technology. The introduction of steamboats and railways in the late 19th century adversely affected the sources of livelihood of the fishermen. Anshuman said that it began with the restrictions on customary fishing rights of the people. According to him, in order to augment their revenue, they kept on trying to gain control over the Gangetic fishery resources, for which they were trying since 1830.

They finally succeeded in their efforts in the year 1859 when the Board of Revenue decided to lease the Ganga and Hoogly, he said, ading, ""leading to abolition of customary rights of open access to the rivers and hence loss of livelihood for many"", he added.

He further said that the plight of the people engaged in both short and long distance water transport worsened. During the boom period, in about 1870, there were about 45,000 boats engaged in trade and the total haulage registered at Sahebganj (now Jharkhand), was over 1 crore maunds, he said. ""But the introduction and extension of railways, steamboats and improvement of roads had an adverse impact on it, leading to its crash around 1880"", he said.

Anshuman said that the British government also discouraged boat transport as it had given 5 per cent guarantee on capital invested in railways. It was also a major source of employment for the English, he said.

6,Two arrested for selling pirated NCERT books,"JAMSHEDPUR: The police have arrested two bookshop owners on charges of selling pirated NCERT books in the Steel City here.

The shopkeepers, Sanjay Kumar and Prahlad Kumar, were booked late on Saturday night after East Singhbhum deputy commissioner Nidhi Khare ordered crackdown on stockiest and dealers of the NCERT books here. The police have confiscated about 1,000 fake books from the three shops owned by the duo in the Jugsalai area.

The police now are on the look out of two more shopkeepers identified as Ashok Prasad and Munna. The two men have gone into hiding after police confiscated a jeep and an autorickshaw laden with duplicate NCERT books of various classes.

The state education secretary, Amit Khare, informed similar racket has been busted in Daltonganj and Giridih districts also. The police have been trying to zero in on the people behind the printing of these duplicate books. ""We would be conducting similar raids in other parts of the state from time to time"", he said.

Not only the pages and the printing of the pirated books are of inferior quality, Amit Khare revealed. But all sorts of errors have been reported in the pirated books. The government is very serious about eradicating this illegal practice that has a bearing on education.

7,State plans law to check graft,"HYDERABAD: The government is contemplating to bring in a legislation to seize properties of employees who acquire them by illegal means.

Some senior officers have reportedly suggested to chief minister Chandrababu Naidu that an enactment titled â€˜Seizure of Properties Act,â€™ should be brought in to control corruption.

According to informed sources, the Centre has prepared a draft bill containing provisions authorising seizure of properties of people, including employees and politicians, who acquire them through illegal means. But it has been put in cold storage because the inclusion of politicians in the ambit of the proposed law would have wide political ramifications. The Centre reportedly opined that other agencies could take care of politicians.

The state government wants to enact the draft bill after including some amendments to ensure that it would not result in witch-hunting of employees. Top sources told The Times of India that an agency, mandated to discharge anti-corruption duties under the enactment, would be empowered to serve notices on suspects who amass wealth beyond their known sources of income. The notice will be served only after establishing a preliminary verification.

The individual will be given an opportunity to explain his/her fortune. If the reply is not satisfactory, the government will seize properties and attach them. â€œThe present legal provisions relating to attachment of properties are cumbersome and complicated,â€� the officials added. Hence, the government was putting the provisions to close legal scrutiny.

8,BJP meet to draw plan for LS polls,"PUNE: The national executive of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will meet in Gwalior on June 25 to finalise an action plan, â€˜Mission 2004â€™, for the next Lok Sabha elections.

This was disclosed by newly-appointed BJP national spokesman Prakash Jawadekar at a felicitation function organised by the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) on Sunday.

Jawadekar said that the BJP, during its recent conclave, decided to contest 300 seats in the Lok Sabha elections on its own and hopes to win at least 400 seats with the help of allies.

The mission plan envisages meetings of party workers to create an awareness at the grassroots level about various central government schemes. Party workers will also organise demonstrations in Congress-ruled states to highlight its failures.

Jawadekar regretted that political parties were planting misleading information about internal party matters in the media, when they should be concentrating on publicising the positive work done by their respective parties.

BJP city unit president Anil Shirole expressed confidence that Jawadekarâ€™s appointment will help in pursuing city matters,which required central assistance.

Jawadekar was felicitated by Shirole on the occasion. BJYM city unit president Suhas Sonawane and others were also present.

9,Left Front looks set to sweep municipality polls,"KOLKATA: Polls in 13 municipalities across West Bengal were held on Sunday amid the Opposition calling it a ''mockery of democracy'' by the CPM election machinery and CPM state secretary Anil Biswas congratulating voters on ''peaceful polls and reaffirmation of their faiths'' in the ruling Left Front.

While the outcome of Balurghat municipality polls will be most interesting in view of the political fallout of bitter fight between LF partners the CPM and the RSP, most of Opposition-held municipalities are likely to be wrested by the Left Front.

The Trinamul Congress, the Congress and the BJP, all complained of use of muscle power by the CPM, booth capturing, false voting as well as denial to genuine voters of the right to vote all over the state.

State election commissioner Ajoy Sinha claimed that everything was fine except for a few â€˜minor allegationsâ€™.

There was a 75 per cent turnout to decide the fate of 837 candidates despite the inclement weather, he said. Opposition leaders however, described the retired IAS officer as â€˜His Masterâ€™s voice.â€™

According to Trinamul Congress chief whip Sobhandeb Chattopadhyay, the CPMâ€™s â€˜terror campaignâ€™ went unabated in Panihati, Habra, Diamond Harbour and other municipalities, with tacit connivance of the police.

â€œThe police hardly helped despite repeated requests. Two polling officers in Diamond Harbour were shifted as they refused to go beyond the prescribed rules and ensure a free poll. Once again it is being proved that free and fair polls would not be possible in the state as long as the CPM holds the reins,â€™â€™ said Chattopadhyay.

Frustrated Trinamul leaders pinned their hope on the forthcoming visit of the NDA team to the state. Mamata Banerjee seems to have garnered a minor concession from NDA and the BJP, who had agreed to send a team after she raised the issue of poll violence during the NDA meet on Saturday.

State Congress secretary Manas Bhuyian also complained of large-scale intimidation by the CPM and demanded action from the Election Commission. The Congress candidate at Panihatiâ€™s Ward 6 was hospitalised after being attacked by CPM men, he alleged. He however, ridiculed the Trinamulâ€™s dependence on the NDA team.

BJP state secretary Mrinal Das said that Juli Sarkar and Anita Dutta, two of the partyâ€™s candidates in Panihati, were thrown out of booths.

The party demanded a repoll in wards 1 and 21. However, he had no idea when the NDA team would come.

10,Uttaranchal govt approaches SC for Ardh Kumbh,"NEW DELHI: In order to meet drinking water needs of lakhs of pilgrims expected to reach Rishikesh for Ardh Kumbh in January 2004, the Uttaranchal Government on Monday approached the Supreme Court seeking permission for constructing a clear water reservoir at Laxman Jhoola area falling inside the Rajaji National Park boundaries.

A vacation Bench comprising Justice R C Lahoti and Justice Brijesh Kumar issued notice to Ministry of Environment and Forests on the State Government''s application moved by advocate Rachana Srivastava.

The Bench referred the application, in terms of its order dated May 9, 2002, to the Standing Committee of Indian Board for Wildlife (IBW) and asked the body to expeditiously give its remarks on the issue.

The State Government said that after thorough survey of the area, it has identified 0.275 hectares of land situated at a distance of 16 kilometres from Rishikesh for construction of the clear water pond but as the area falls within the Rajaji National Park, it had to approach the Court, which had banned construction activity within national parks and sanctuaries.

""The land is required for construction of the reservoir and for the purpose of laying water pipeline of 986 metres length,"" the Government said and added construction of reservoir would not require felling of even a single tree.

The State Government also said that it would construct another reservoir inside the National Park for the animals and undertake afforestation of similar area in lieu of the land for reservoir at Rishikesh.

11,Hazare files defamation case against state minister,"PUNE: Social crusader Anna Hazare filed a defamation case against the Maharashtra food and civil supplies minister Suresh Jain in the city on Monday.

The case, which was personally filed by Hazare in the court of P K Kulkarni, judicial magistrate first class (JMFC), anti corruption court, has charged Jain with defamation under sections 499 and 500 of the Indian Penal code (IPC).

Speaking to reporters after filing the case, Hazare, said that Jain, had in an interview to the media recently called Hazare, a ''bhondhu'' (an idiot) and accused him of embezzling Rs 75 lakhs from the Bank of Maharashtra and committing fraud with the funds of the Hind Swaraja Trust and CAPART (Council for advancement of peopleâ€™s action and rural technology)

Terming the allegations as baseless, Hazare said, ""The question of embezzlement of bank funds does not arise, as I have not taken any loan from the Bank of Maharashtra. Also the CAPART, is a Government of India undertaking specialising in the field of rural development and I am just an office bearer."" According to Hazare, Jain, would have to produce proof of his allegations or face the judicial consequences.

When asked if he could prove the charges of corruption that he had levelled against Jain in the past, Hazare said, ""We have proof of Jain, having broken rules of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), NABARD ( National Bank for agriculture and rural development) and the Co-operative Societies Act. We will keep documentary proof on display at the August Kranti maidan in Mumbai on August 9.""

Earlier in the day, Hazare, kicked off a state wide protest against the state government for transferring Ratnakar Gaikwad (IAS), former commissioner of co-operation, Government of Maharashtra, in an arbitrary manner after he had led an offensive against co-operative banks committing financial irregularities.

Hazare, undertook a protest march early on Monday morning after garlanding the statue of Mahatma Gandhi opposite the Pune railway station.

Addressing a public gathering outside the Pune district collectorâ€™s office, Hazare accused politicians in the state for spinning a web of corruption in the co-operative banks, co-operative milk dairies and co-operative spinning mills of the state.

12,Star to explain its share holding pattern to govt,"NEW DELHI: The Star Group may have to do some explaining to the government on shareholding pattern in its application seeking permission to uplink its news channel from India, the deadline for which expires on June 26.

Government is likely to seek a clarification from the Rupert Murdoch Group, which is understood to have floated Media Content and Communication Services Ltd with an equity base of only Rs one lakh to meet the requirement of dilution of its stake to 26 per cent for uplinking from the country.

The government is examining Star''s application, the sources said.

Though they said government did not want to delay giving its clearance, if for some reason it could not give its nod before June 26, the Star News channel had the option of uplinking from abroad. But this would mean that for any live coverage in India the channel would have to seek special permission from the government.

The Star Group offloaded 74 per cent stake in its news operations to resident Indians and held 26 per cent of the total paid up capital in the Star News channel business, to abide by the March 26 guidelines issued by the government.

While the Star Group said June 26 was the deadline for submitting its fresh application for uplinking its news channel from India, according to the Government it is the deadline for getting the government''s clearance.

As per the guidelines, the channel must be registered in India, majority of board directors have to be resident Indians as also the CEO or head of the channel and those exercising editorial control.

Government stipulated that permission for usage of facilities and infrastructure for live news and footage collection and transmission be given to only channels uplinked from India but for a smooth roll over the channels were given a maximum of three months to come within the framework of the guidelines.

13,BJP banks on Ayodhya deal for polls,"NEW DELHI: The Vajpayee government may not have the full backing of the VHP and the RSS for its Ayodhya initiative, but the BJP is supporting the move fully. With the BJP uncertain about the results of the assembly elections to four key states at the end of the year, which will set the tone for the general elections in 2004, sources said, it feels a â€œsuccessâ€� on the Ram Janmabhoomi front could make all the difference.

A senior party leader even said that the positive impact in the country of solving the Ayodhya issue, if it includes building a temple at the disputed site, would outweigh any displeasure incurred. Party General Secretary Mukthar Abbas Naqvi admitted on Monday that though the preliminaries were being done without the VHP, the latter would have to be brought in at a later stage to ensure the acceptability of the formula being worked on.

The BJP leadership wanted this time to get the Muslim leadership on board before getting the VHP in as it feels that this approach carries a greater chance of success. On the government''s Ayodhya-for-Kashi-and-Mathura formula, which has been strenuously opposed by the VHP and the RSS, Naqvi was non-committal.

However, BJP sources said with functioning mosques, cheek by jowl with Hindu temples, at both Kashi and Mathura, there was no way that the shrines could be handed over entirely to the Hindus. However, for the moment, the BJP does not wish to say anything publicly on this. One senior leader said: â€œWe don''t mind if the VHP keeps talking about its claim to these two.â€�

Sources say that the starting point for a solution this time will have to be with the withdrawal of the title suit by the Sunni Waqf Board. This could then pave the way for a suitable parliamentary resolution or legislation to hand over the disputed land for a Ram temple.

Equally, the success of the current effort would depend on the government, including some concessions to the Muslim community apart from construction of a mosque beyond a 10-km radius of the disputed site. This could include the throwing open of defunct mosques, currently in the hands of the ASI.

Officially, the line is that it is the Kanchi Shankaracharya, who has floated a formula. But, sources said, it was an entirely government-sponsored initiative. The fact that the PM''s emissaries, finance minister Jaswant Singh and defence minister George Fernandes, flew to Chennai on Sunday to meet the Shankaracharya, these sources said, underlines the government''s involvement in the current initiative.

The Muslim Personal Law Board, which had responded negatively initially to the Shankaracharya''s overtures, is now meeting on July 6 in Lucknow to consider his written proposal. Board spokesperson Qasim Rasool Ilyas told TNN that the community was willing to give serious consideration to any proposal, provided it had the stamp of the government, as â€œonly the government can honour and implement any proposalâ€�.
