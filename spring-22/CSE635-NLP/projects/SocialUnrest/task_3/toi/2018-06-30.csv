0,Focus on farm sector in 10th Plan: Vajpayee,"new delhi: prime minister vajpayee has said that the focus in the tenth five year plan should be on agriculture. he also wants the tenth five year plan to be one that benefits the poor. vajpayee's observations came in his closing remarks during the full planning commission meeting friday to discuss and give approval to the approach paper to the tenth five year plan. noting that previous five year plans have ``left behind a long legacy of unmet targets and unfulfilled objectives'', the pm hoped that the tenth five year plan will not only contain ``better policies'' but also see their ``surer implementation''. stating that the challenge to double the country's per capita income in the next decade has been taken up, the pm said this will need a sustainable annual growth rate of eight per cent in the tenth plan. expressing happiness with the plan's greater committment to the development of the social sector, vajpayee also said that he attaches the ``greatest importance to attracting higher private investment into education and health- care through a new public-private partnership''. the removal of regional, social and gender imbalances too will receive a greater focus in the tenth five year plan, he assured. regarding plan schemes, he said a number of them will have to be reoriented and those that have outlived their utility will have to be wound up while others will have to be merged. there are some sectors in need of immediate attention and action, said vajpayee. ``the power sector is in a crisis,'' he remarked. calling for a review of the existing policies in the power sector, the pm said bold steps need to be taken to push forward power sector reforms. railways is yet another sector which is ``crying for our attention'', said vajpayee. calling for the initiation of comprehensive reforms, he said this will need large investments for expansion, modernisation and improvement in safety standards. earlier, in his opening remarks at the meeting, planning commission deputy chairman, k c pant stressed on another item on the meeting's agenda, that of giving central assistance to states on the basis of agreed programmes of reform. ``we believe that such an arrangement is essential if we are to improve the effectiveness and quality of government expenditure as well as bring about sustainability in public finances,'' he said, adding that the planning commission would take up the issue with the finance ministry to optimise benefits which can be realised from this approach. pant also emphasised the need for power sector reforms. while taking note of steps taken for power sector reforms by the centre and the states, he said the progress had been slow. ``the present state of the power sector is such that unless urgent measures are taken with full political support, it will become a major drag on our growth process,'' he said.

1,Panel calls for freeing agricultural marketing,"new delhi: an expert group constituted to look into the present system of agricultural marketing in the country has made a strong pitch for freeing it from the clutches of regulated markets. it has also suggested that the government examine existing policies, rules and regulations in order to remove all those legal hurdles which inhibit a free marketing system. the 16-member expert committee headed by shankerlal guru, chairman of the international society for agricultural marketing, gave its report to union agriculture minister nitish kumar on friday. estimating that the strengthening of the agricultural marketing infrastructure will cost rs 2,68,742 crore, the committee says most of it will have to come from the private sector. kumar announced the setting up of an inter-ministerial committee which shall be examining the guru committee report. this committee will submit its report within three months, he added. the present problem, where agricultural marketing is concerned, is that farmers get less for their produce and consumers have to pay more, said kumar. explaining the need for this inter-ministerial committee, union agriculture secretary j n l srivastava said it will go into the multi-dimensional issues that have been raised in the report. moreover, he said, if there are any bottlenecks faced by farmers in getting a good price, these will be removed. the guru committee report has noted that regulated markets have only had ``limited success''. it points out that while these regulated markets were expected to ensure ``smooth and orderly development of agri-marketing by ensuring fair-play of trade practices and market forces,'' these have instead become ``restrictive.'' the fallout of this, says the report, has been the absence of free and competitive trade, huge post-harvest losses owing to the extra time required for handling and lack of encouragement to private investors in the area of storage and agri-industries. importantly, the report also notes that the marketing system has failed to reflect situations of plenty or scarcity in production owing to government intervention in the food market and piling of foodgrains in food corporation of india godowns. with the prevailing atmosphere of liberalisation, the committee suggests that direct purchase from farmers should be allowed and mega-markets be developed as joint ventures. as for government intervention, it says this should not happen except in ``rare, critical times.'' the committee has also suggested that the essential commodities act, 1955, be repealed and 27 other acts be amended to facilitate to allow free play of market forces. it also says that the ``government needs to examine all existing policies, rules and regulations with a view to remove all legal provisions inhibiting free marketing system.'' giving reasons for the need to encourage direct marketing, the report says it will help farmers to meet the specific needs of wholesalers as also consumers. also, it says direct marketing serves as an incentive for quality and enhanced productivity, reduces distribution losses and even helps farmers improve their their incomes with the use of better technology.
