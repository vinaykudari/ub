0,Ryots protest Narayanpur water release,"BIJAPUR: The Karnataka governmentâ€™s decision to release water from Narayanpur reservoir near Havinal village has created commotion amongst the farmers of the Bhima river area.

It was decided to release water by making a breach in Indi Canal to the Bori Nala which reaches Ouz Shirnal barrage, said to be utilised for drinking purpose for Sholapur city of Maharashtra. The Bhima River Protection Committee has already announced to gherao Krishna Bhagya Nigam office at Zalki on Tuesday and has demanded immediate stoppage of water to Ouz barrage. They have also said that if water is released, it should be released to all barrages of Karnataka. The district administration has posted police force at important points of the canals. Four companies of KSRP have been deployed. The water released has to flow 8 km and join Bhima river at Sankh village and from there on it has to flow 18 km to reach Ouz village.

1,Muzaffarpur farmer’s move to export litchi to Europe,"MUZAFFARPUR: A farmer of Nawada village under Mushahari block, Sushil Kumar Singh, who was awarded ""Krishi Visharad Samman"" by the Government of India in New Delhi on December 23 last for his rich contributions in popularising the zero tillage system under Asian Development Bank project, is all set to install a Rs 2 crore worth processing plant for exporting 100 tonnes of fresh litchi and 500 tonnes of litchi pulp to European countries from the coming litchi season.

The farmer, who claims to own litchi orchards of 20 bigha, plans to purchase a latest machine of fruit processing plant with bank loans including 25 per cent subsidy from the Union ministry of food processing. It includes sulphur treatment and pre-cooling plants.

Talking to newsman in his village on Monday, Singh said he has a plan to despatch Shahi litchi in 1 to 10 kg packings of cardboards to Europe where one kilogram of litchi is sold at 3 pounds. He may have to spend a total of Rs 180 per kg over processing and transport. The cost of the best quality of Shahi litchi has so far not gone beyond Rs 12 per kg, he informed. While the fresh litchi would be of only Shahi variety, the pulp may be from both Shahi and China, he said.

The packed litchi would be sent first to Mumbai in refrigerated vans and from there to European capitals in large planes. The facility of cargo planes was not provided to Patna even in the last season even after assurance by food and supply minister Sharad Yadav, it may be noted.

Singh also plans to enter into vegetable trade with the help of the processing plant. The life of seasonal vegetables can be extended by three months with this machine, he said. The only help needed from the government is regular electric supply for at least 12 hours a day, he said.

It may be noted that Sushil Kumar Singh would be the third litchi exporter after R K Kedia of Muzaffarpur and Rajesh Kumar of Hajipur. He is being closely guided by a scientist of National Litchi Research Centre, Rajesh Kumar and RAU scientists in plant protection. He has sprayed his plants twice so far, he said.

2,Karmapa aide’s ‘affair’ alerts govt,"GAYA: The proximity between Gyngme Gyatso, an aide of Buddhist spiritual leader Karmapa who is in Bodh Gaya to attend Kalchakra Pooja, and a Chinese girl, Chen Yun Hann, has alerted state government agencies.

Gyatso was found ""flirting"" with Hann in a Bodh Gaya monastery late on Sunday evening. He was found in the girlâ€™s room without any plausible excuse, intelligence sources said.

Sonam N Dagpo, additional secretary, department of information and international relations of the Tibetan government in exile, however, told TNN that the Tibetan authorities had not been formally informed about the incident. Only the local police officials are in a position to give an authentic version, Dagpo said.

According to well-placed sources, both the Karmapa aide and the Chinese girl were let off after questioning as no criminal offence was committed by them. However, the incident has alarmed the security and intelligence agencies as only three years back the Karmapa made a sensational escape from China- occupied Tibet.

The Karmapa was subsequently provided political asylum in the country despite the suspicion being expressed in some circles that the Karmapa did not escape from Tibet but has been planted by China as part of a strategy.

The girl is believed to have told official interrogators that she has been in regular touch with the Karmapa aide and had even been to Dharmashala in Himachal Pradesh, the headquarters of the Tibetan government in exile. Alarmed intelligence officials have sent a report to the state police headquarters on the incident, police sources said, adding the intelligence officials are keeping a close watch on the Chinese girl. Though DM Brajesh Mehrotra could not be contacted, sources confirmed the administration has received a report on the incident.

3,Governor gets memos on RJD ‘misrule’,"PATNA: Governor Vinod Chandra Pande on Monday was flooded with memoranda against the state government. They were submitted by various components of the NDA and also by the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), which is outside the alliance.

The NDA delegation consisted of Nandkishore Yadav, Kiran Ghai, Navin Kishore Prasad, Giriraj Singh (all BJP), Janata Dal (U) legislature party leader Ganesh Prasad Yadav, Samata Party leaders Subodh Kumar, P K Sinha, Shyam Sunder Singh Dheeraj and Upendra Kushwaha. JD (U) leaders Laxmi Sahu and Vijay Kumar Verma submitted a memorandum that was particularly harsh on RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav, as it alleged that he had ""nexus with criminals"".

The NDA delegation informed the governor that the innocent and poor people, mainly labourers, were being framed in false cases for violence during the Bihar bandh. The delegation demanded a special inquiry into ""RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadavâ€™s links with criminals"". The NDA delegation sought the governorâ€™s intervention to check the stateâ€™s rising crime graph.

""Laloo is patronising criminals and abductors. There have been umpteen occasions when people kidnapped from different places in the state were released following intervention by the RJD boss and those who failed in getting the blessings of 1, Anne Marg languished for months together in captivity,"" said BJP state chief Nand Kishore Yadav while talking to mediapersons here. Other NDA leaders were also present.

The memorandum expressed serious resentment over the administrative action taken by the state government over the killing of the three youths in a fake encounter in the Ashiana Nagar locality that occurred here on Dec 28.

According to the NDA leaders, so far only one sub-inspector has been arrested, while the four constables involved in the ""barbaric incident"" have been moving scot-free.

They referred to the power supply snapped in the Ashiana Nagar and Sheikhpura localities on the night of January 3 after the Bihar bandh, when the police forced their way into a number of houses and also beat up local residents, apart from misbehaving with women. The NDA leaders charged that the local administration made a bid to kill the arrested NDA leaders during the bandh by setting ablaze the bus in which they were detained.

""We were saved by the grace of God. The entire administration is in the grip of lumpens .... Nobody is safe in Bihar as long as Lalooâ€™s dummy rule continues,"" they insisted.

The state BJP chief said that the Manjhaul SDPO, responsible for the killing of two innocent youths and causing injury to two others in an indiscriminate firing on a Tata Sumo on Dec 23, had still to be arrested.

The NCP delegation, headed by former chief minister Jagannath Mishra, too submitted a memorandum to the governor, expressing serious concern over alarming increase in cases of blatant human rights violations and deaths in fake encounters across the state. He demanded constitution of the state human rights commission.

4,"RYA, AISA to launch stir against Rabri govt","PATNA: The Revolutionary Youth Association (RYA) and the All India Students Association (AISA) have jointly decided to launch a phase-wise agitation demanding the ouster of the Rabri government in the wake of killings of three innocent youths in a fake encounter at Ashiana Nagar recently.

This announcement was made by the RYA and AISA leaders at its Jan Adalat programme held here at the Patna Junction roundabout on Monday. Abhyudaya of AISA in his ""chargesheet"" against the Rabri government said ""the RJD government during its 13-year rule allegedly killed thousands of innocent people and children of Bihar. It has no right to remain in power for a single day"", he said.

The adalat has demanded the immediate resignation of the Rabri government. ""If it fails to resign then we will launch a sustained movement in the state"", said Kamlesh Sharma of RYA.

It has also decided to take out a youth-student march at the state level on January 22. Speaking on this occasion, Kamlesh Sharma said that Laloo-Rabri government in Bihar have succeeded in making its own brigade of criminal gangs.

The police has been playing the role of ""judge and jallad"", he said. Prominent among those who spoke on this occasion were Shambhu Nath Mehta, Kumar Anil, Paramhans Kumar, Vidyanand Vikal, Anita Sinha, Ram Jatan Sharma, K D Yadav and Mithilesh Yadav.

5,Plans to simplify EIA rules again,"NEW DELHI: Having already amended the rules half a dozen times in nine years, the Union environment ministry is planning once again to â€œsimplifyâ€� regulations on the mandatory environmental impact assessment (EIA) of developmental and industrial projects as well as the procedure for clearance to chop forests.

Environmentalists are dismayed, simply because they feel the law is being, diluted in the name of necessary simplification. â€œIt doesnâ€™t make the law more effective. It just becomes easier for polluters to do what they are doing,â€� says Centre for Science and Environment chief Sunita Narain. The EIA rules were last amended just six months ago. The aim of setting rules for nearly 30 types of projects, which also mandated public hearings for such schemes, was to ensure environmental impact wasnâ€™t a neglected afterthought and give those affected, or concerned, a chance to be heard. Special secretary V.K. Duggal, confirming the move to further simplify the EIA rules, says the process is â€œat a very, very initial stageâ€�. The attempt will be to minimise procedures and set â€œbroad policy guidelinesâ€� instead of deciding â€œcertain things on an ad hoc, case-to-case basisâ€�. The objective, he says, is to avoid red-tape, not dilute the spirit of the rules. Adds Duggal, â€œWeâ€™ve taken a conscious decision that we must allow economic and social development at the desired pace while preserving the environment.â€� What he does not say is that the orders have come from the standing committee of secretaries, which wants to make the clearance process time-bound and transparent. Among the suggestions: simplify the forms for forest clearances, try and set time-limits and look at the possibility of delegating powers to state governments for environmental clearance to projects such as small power plants.",NEW DELHI
6,Centre to simplify rules for environmental clearance,"NEW DELHI: Having already amended the rules half a dozen times in nine years, the Union environment ministry is planning once again to ""simplify"" regulations on the mandatory environmental impact assessment (EIA) of developmental and industrial projects as well as the procedure for clearance to chop forests.

Environmentalists are dismayed, simply because they feel the law is being, and has been, diluted in the name of necessary simplification. ""It doesn''t make the law more effective. It just becomes easier for polluters to do what they are doing,"" says Centre for Science and Environment chief Sunita Narain.

The EIA rules were last amended just six months ago.

The aim of setting rules for nearly 30 types of projects, which also mandated public hearings for such schemes, was to ensure environmental impact wasn''t a neglected afterthought and give those affected, or concerned, a chance to be heard.

Special secretary V K Duggal, confirming the move to further simplify the EIA rules, says the process is ""at a very, very initial stage"". The attempt will be to minimise procedures and set ""broad policy guidelines"" instead of deciding ""certain things on an ad hoc, case-to-case basis"". The objective, he says, is to avoid red-tapism, not dilute the spirit of the rules. Adds Duggal, ""We''ve taken a conscious decision in the ministry that we must allow economic and social development at the desired pace while preserving the environment, have a balanced approach.""

What he doesn''t say is that the orders have come from the standing committee of secretaries, which wants to make the clearance process time-bound and transparent. Among the suggestions: Simplify the forms for forest clearances, try and set time-limits, make the system more efficient, decide pending irrigation projects and look at the possibility of delegating powers to state governments for environmental clearance to projects such as small power plants.

Responds a forest department officer, ""There is a limit to simplification. We take an average time of three to six months to clear a proposal, if it is accurate and inescapable....but we''re not like a shopkeeper keeping stuff ready for sale.""

On the EIA rules, the government''s last amendments in June raised the investment limit for projects exempted from Rs 50 crore to Rs 100 crore for 16 categories. The list included highway schemes, thermal power, nuclear power and river valley projects, ports, harbours and airports, petroleum refineries, chemical fertilisers and the synthetic rubber industry. Even small projects here have potentially serious environmental consequences.

Earlier amendments, says Kanchi Kohli of the environmental group Kalpavriksh, have already chipped away at the number of industries required to get clearance, the quality of EIA reports required and the public hearing process mandated.

""There has been a gradual dilution,"" she says, ""and it has definitely reduced the space for people''s participation."" The information in EIA reports, in several cases, has been ""inadequate or inaccurate"". Kohli cites a Karnataka example where a consultancy firm ""plagiarised"" the report of one project for another. Delegating power to the states, says Kohli, may prove a double-edged sword since regional interests and influences may sway a deal.

7,SP youth rally lambasts Mayawati government,"Lucknow: Hundreds of workers of the Samajwadi Party youth wing courted arrest on Monday against the failure of the government to redress the problems of the youth even as senior state-level leaders slammed the Mayawati government for unleashing terror on traders and allegedly amassing wealth on her birthday.

The demonstration by members of the Yuvjan Sabha, Lohia Vahini, Chhatra Sabha and Mulayam Singh Yadav Youth Brigade began around 11 am when they made their way from the party office to the Vidhan Sabha. Led by MP and national president of the youth wing Akhilesh Singh Yadav, they raised anti-Mayawati slogans such as Behenji aur uska Bhai, kha gaye Janata ki gadhi kamai and Chhatra virodhi sarkar barkhast karo.

While the sloganeering was on, SP workers were huddled in some waiting buses and taken to the Police Lines from where they were released.

Later, addressing a joint press conference, state president Ram Sharan Das and general secretary Shivpal Singh Yadav claimed that similar demonstrations held in other districts were a success. The demonstration was held in support of a six-point charter of demands which included putting an immediate end to commercialisation and privatisation of education, withdrawal of hike in fee, giving employment to unemployed, holding of election to the student bodies, putting an end to the harassment of youth as also farmers and traders.

Referring to the death of an Aminabad trader Jasbir Singh on Sunday, the two leaders alleged it was on account of police harassment and demanded immediate action against the officers responsible for it. They referred to the recent suicide by a police officer of Azamgarh and alleged it was his inability to make available funds, which led him to take the drastic step. The alleged collection of money by chief minister Mayawati was also spoken of by them.

Lambasting the Annexe Fifth Floor officers, Yadav said they were indulging in corrupt practices and requested governor Vishnukant Shastri to dismiss the government.

8,Traders' bandh a success in city,"Lucknow: Traders'' bandh in the city on Monday was a resounding success. Nearly all the shops were closed to protest thedeath of jeweller Jasbir Singh on Sunday allegedly owing to police pressure. The huge demonstrations caused traffic snarls on Sri Ram Road and Qaiserbagh. Later, Jasbir was cremated under heavy security. The body was not sent for autopsy on the insistence of deceased''s family . The district authorities at a press conference, however, reiterated that the jeweller died of heart failure and ruled out police coercion behind the tragedy.

In a rare gesture of solidarity, shops in almost all the major commercial areas including Aminabad, La Touche Road, Maulviganj, Rakabganj, Chowk, Saadatganj, Nakkhas, Alambagh, Hazratganj, Qaiserbagh, Nishatganj, Mahanagar, Indira Nagar, Gomtinagar and the adjoining areas remained closed all day long.

Many processions taken out by the traders threw traffic out of gear in busy Aminabad, Qaiserbagh and La Touche Road areas. The traders assembled at Sri Ram Road trisection where they blocked the road and raised anti-police slogans demanding action against the senior police officials. This caused severe traffic congestions in and around Aminabad and Qaiserbagh areas for better part of the day. The procession then reached city office of the Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) in Qaiserbagh where they burnt old tyres. Here too the demonstration threw traffic haywire.

They later converged at the Nirala Nagar residence of Jasbir from where the funeral procession began. Initially the authorities insisted that the body be sent for post-mortem examination. But the family members of the victim vehemently opposed it. The funeral procession was heavily guarded by police.

Meanwhile, state president of the Uttar Pradesh Yuva Udyog Vyapar Mandal (UPYUVM) Sandeep Bansal who has been spearheading the agitation since day one, announced that the protests by the trading community would continue till the guilty were brought to book. ""We will not allow the sacrifices of Jasbir to go waste,"" Bansal told TNN adding that the traders would again collect outside the Aminabad police station on Tuesday morning to continue their agitation.

Refuting the statement of the district authorities that Jasbir was not subjected to any pressure by the ADM City and SP City, Sandeep said that the jeweller was called for a meeting with the two officials at Bengal Hotel and the traders sitting on a dharna at the gate of Aminabad police station were kept away from the deliberations. ""Why were we kept away and the meeting held in a cladestine manner ?"" questioned Sandeep Bansal .

9,Patriotism? At the cost of merit? Never!,"NEW DELHI: When eight-year-old NRI Jyotsana Jethani was killed on the escalator at Delhi''s Indira Gandhi International airport on the night of December 13, 1999, yet another glaring example of Indiaâ€™s dismal record in public services had left the NRI community in particular aghast.

The escalator''s comb plates had caved in, trapping the Dubai-based schoolgirl, while no one from the airport staff bothered to rescue her till it was too late. The automatic safety device had also failed to work. The escalator was shut for ""repairs"" till June 15, 2000. When it was recommissioned, it had two similar mishaps within a fortnight, though without loss of life or injury to anyone.

The tragic accident has since become history but passengers flying in to the Indian capital still remember the accident or its news coverage with horror. Quite understandably, many of the weak-hearted are still seen taking the staircase down when they arrive in Delhi.

At the height of the taxi and auto strike last month, it was again the inbound traveller who got hit the most. Passengers with all their luggage and longing to get back home, were treated to a harrowing time, either paying a steep tariff for a private car or availing of the crowded bus service to the city.

Mumbai''s Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport is no better. The country''s busiest airport has a transit lounge that sees hundreds of passengers waiting to take a connecting flight - some stretching out on the slumberettes, or some even on the floors. But the entire lounge, which doesn''t permit entry into the city, has no currency exchange counter and only two coin operated phones for local calls. The transit passenger who arrives from abroad is expected to carry Indian currency in their wallets if he wants to make a local phone call before flying out. The manned counter allows only STD and ISD calls, provided he is willing to stand in a winding queue. The spacious Taj Lounge in the departure area overlooking the tarmac was shut down a couple of years ago after becoming unviable.

When compared to the Heathrow in London, JFK in New York or the glamorous Sheikh Rashid concourse of Dubai airport, the services offered at Delhi or Mumbai airports hardly pass muster. National flag carrier, Air India also scores badly in comparison with other international airlines. Hiten Patel, a Scotland-based NRI resolved not to fly Air India since the dawn of the new millennium. Shortly after his arrival from London, the corner-shop owner told Times News Network, ""Why should I pay an equal amount and not avail of superior facilities instead?â€� The likes of Patel, who spend their own money to travel to India, prefer to bypass patriotic sentiments while exercising their choice. Most airlines offer TV screens with every seat. Better lavatories and better decor. Air India bought its last aircraft in 1993, and is yet to offer the latest frills on its flights.

Even local transport in Delhi has its own ills. The age-old problem of errant taxis and autos continue to plague passengers like chronic rheumatism. For all the bold and defiant statements by Delhi''s transport minister, the auto and taxi drivers only have a dismissive laugh to offer. A Delhi Tourist Police counter in the middle of Janpath is of little assistance, since tourists ""donâ€™t come forward to seek assistance.""

""Service is one aspect we Indians never give enough importance to. As long as operations are not affected, quality is a luxury we tend to do without,"" says a senior Air India official on condition of anonymity. Examples like these abound - all pointing to a lack of concern and sensitivity for quality services that can boost or tarnish Indiaâ€™s image.

But it is not an altogether dark canvas. The banking sector has truly gone world class, thanks to economic liberalisation. The suave and responsible MNC personal banker has almost eclipsed the laid back nonchalant clerk at a nationalised bank branch. Banking transactions can now be completed at round-the-clock ATMs and even over the phone. A visit to the bank during banking hours is needed only when absolutely necessary.

With the exponential growth in Indiaâ€™s software sector, has come in yet another boom industry â€“ that of the call centres. These human-intensive professionally managed units, many of them having multinational affiliations, have put the Indian service sector on the world map. With low manpower costs and superior English-speaking skills, big MNC giants like American Express serve their global clientele out of Delhi. Credit cards are now accepted in most commercial outlets, that makes shopping much easier. Airline and railway reservations have also been computerised, which makes travel planning easier.

All this has been fuelled by the telecom renaissance that has changed the face of Indiaâ€™s communication infrastructure. Unlike a decade back, telephones not only work, but are available after almost every 100 metres even in the smallest of towns. Internet connectivity is reasonably affordable and easily available.

All thatâ€™s fine, says the NRI. But the legacy of ineffective law and order enforcement, coupled with a total disregard for civic sense leaves the NRI fuming each time he comes home. Fifty five years after independence, patriotism cuts little ice. Having bred on professionalism and a highly competitive and quality-conscious marketplace, it is not easy anymore to make the non-resident Indian feel at home with just a sentimental diet.

10,"NDA, Left stage dharna against Rabri govt","PATNA: The NDA and Left parties on Tuesday staged dharnas across Bihar to press for dismissal of the Rabbi Devi ministry for its alleged failure to check lawlessness and police brutality.

Braving cold wave conditions, activists of BJP, Samata and JD(U) sat on dharnas in the state capital and district headquarters, protesting the death of three students in a ""fake encounter"" on December 28 and alleged highhandedness of the police with the agitators during the state-wide bandh on January 3.

The main dharna was organised at the Income Tax roundabout here where NDA leaders, including state BJP president Nand Kishore Yadav, JD(U) leader Vijendra Prasad Yadav and Samata Leader P K Sinha launched a vitriolic attack on the Laloo-Rabri regime for allegedly unleashing a reign of terror, corruption, anarchy and chaos.

They demanded that the Centre impose President''s Rule in Bihar if Rabri Devi did not resign.

The law and order had reached its nadir, criminals were ruling the roost with the patronage of RJD leaders and kidnapping was flourishing like an industry while no development work was taking place, they said adding that the chief minister had no moral right to continue in office.

Activists of the Left parties, including CPI, CPI(M) and CPI(ML), too held dharnas at different places to protest ""police excesses"" on bandh supporters.

They rejected the state government''s decision to recommend a CBI probe into the alleged fake encounter as, they claimed, it had already been established that it was a ""cold-blooded murder"".

11,BJP tells its youth wing to work hard for polls,"NEW DELHI: Bouyed by the party''s resounding win in the Gujarat Assembly elections, BJP leaders on Tuesday asked the party''s youth wing to work with renewed vigour for the coming Assembly elections in ten states.

Hitting out at the Congress for deliberately carrying on a ""disinformation"" campaign against BJP, Civil Aviation Minister Shah Nawaz Hussain told the meeting of the Yuva Morcha''s National Executive here that ""it is the BJP which alone can protect the minorities in the country as it was never against any religious group.""

He said the Congress campaign against the BJP government in Gujarat during the Assembly elections was carried out not only in India but also outside the country.

Speaking on the occasion, party general secretary Rajah Singh, who inaugurated the day-long meeting, said, ""Hindutva was a way of life and was complementary to cultural nationalism. Our rivals are unnecessarily seeking to raise a controversy over this issue.""

Singh said Hindutva was the ""lifeline of India and in India''s culture"", a tradition followed for thousands of years.

Yuva Morcha President G Kishan Reddy said the Morcha would be launching a nationwide signature campaign from June 12 to 26 against terrorism specially cross-border terrorism being aided and abetted by Pakistan.

""As part of this campaign, we will be collecting two crore signatures to be given to the United Nations asking it to declare Pakistan a terrorist state,"" he said.

Reddy said the Morcha would be organising a two-day international youth conference against terrorism on February 10 and 11.

12,Kerala govt steps in to help Gulf returnees,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The Kerala government has requested airline companies to offer concessional fares to peolple returning from the Gulf availing the general amnesty to illegal residents declared by the UAE government.

Immigration and customs departments at ports and airports had also been asked to be lenient towards the returnees, the Non-resident Keralite Affairs (NORKA) minister M M Hassan told reporters after the meeting of a cabinet sub-committee formed for the purpose.

The NORKA department was collecting the details of illegal residents likely to come back during the four-month amnesty period which began on Jan 1, he said.

The minister said he would meet External Affairs Minister Yashwant Sinha at New Delhi during the `Pravasi Bharat Divas'' celebrations between Jan 9 and 11 to seek central government''s assistance on the matter.

The minister and officials would visit the UAE if necessary to extend a helping hand to the returnees, he said adding the Kerala government wanted all illegal residents in the Gulf to make use of the amnesty offer.

A co-ordinated effort involving chiefs of three airports in the state, district collectors, passport officers, immigration and customs officers, airline companies, travel agents and police was being planned to help the returnees, Hassan said.

The Railway authorities would also be asked to provide free passage to returnees who land at Mumbai to travel to Kerala, he said.

13,"Panel moots farmers' body on FICCI, CII lines","NEW DELHI: An official committee chaired by Vice-President Bhairon Singh Shekhawat has proposed a national apex body for farmers on the lines of busines and industry associations such as FICCI and CII.

The Shekhawat committee has been constituted to prepare programmes on how best to mark the birth centenary year of the late Charan Singh, former Prime Minister and considered a farmers'' leader. It had its first meeting here on Tuesday with Shekhawat in the chair. It decided to form a sub-committee for each of three things, the first being the proposed national farmers'' association.

The proposed body is to work for the cause of farmers and also be a ``think-tank'''' for the farm sector, besides providing inputs for policy, it was decided.

Another panel will prepare a programme to disseminate Charan Singh''s ideology. The third will decide how to ``create durable assets'''' and like programmes to implement Charan Singh''s ideas.

Among those who attended the meeting were Union ministers Ajit Singh (son of Charan Singh), Jagmohan and Sharad Yadav, Planning Commission deputy chairman K C Pant, BJP president Venkaiah Naidu and some political leaders, including Harkishan Singh Surjeet and Ram Vilas Paswan.

14,Cabinet reshuffle likely after polls,"NEW DELHI: Changes in the Vajpayee ministry will possibly be made during the gap between the conclusion of the assembly elections in Himachal Pradesh slated for early February and the beginning of the budget session in the second half of that month, according to senior cabinet sources.

The sources said the first category of changes planned are largely overdue and will be from among NDA partners. With the acceptance of Omar Abdullahâ€™s resignation from the Union council of ministers, former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Farooq Abdullah is likely to be accommodated in the cabinet, as is Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee, who will complete two years out of government.

The second category of changes planned is to replace ministers now put in charge or to be put in charge of states going to the polls in the second half of the year â€” Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh. The BJP has appointed ministers of state Vasundhara Raje and Raman Singh as state chiefs of Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh respectively, but only the latter has so far resigned from the Union ministry. However, his resignation is yet to be accepted.

In the case of MP, Union Minister for Coal and Mines Uma Bharati has not yet been designated state BJP chief, but she has already launched the election campaign in the state.

By February, there will be barely eight months left for the elections in these states and these leaders will need full-time commitment to the states, the sources said. Hence, these three ministers could well be replaced by then.

The third category of changes remains in the realm of speculation, with the names of two of the party''s general secretaries - both former cabinet ministers - Rajnath Singh and Arun Jaitley making the rounds of party circles for re-inclusion in the cabinet. Singh''s inclusion or otherwise would depend on the BJP''s electoral plans for Uttar Pradesh. Given the former UP chief minister is not one of state CM Mayawati''s backers, it might be considered more prudent to have him in the Centre rather than manage the BJP''s affairs in the state.

15,Police probe financial details of party that failed to set sail,"MUMBAI: The Yellow Gate police are investigating the financial details of the much-hyped new year party that never was. On January 1, the police arrested the organiser, Arvind Gupta, his son Gaurav, and his friend Abhishek Pasari for cheating a large number of people to whom they had sold passes. â€œThe exact amount of money made by way of sale of the passes is yet to be ascertained as they did not have a price printed on them,â€™â€™ senior officer said. The police will also investigate Guptaâ€™s claim that the passes were duplicated and sold by his rivals.

However, an officer said the passes, which were specially designed and resembled a majestic scroll, would have been difficult to duplicate. In fact, the ambiguity about the price tag makes it all the more difficult for those who returned without a party to claim a refund. Interestingly though, the organisers refunded 216 people a sum of Rs 1,500 each on December 31 itself when they started shouting slogans and manhandling the organisers. Gupta, Gaurav and Abhishek were released on bail by the Ballard Pier court. They apologised to the court for the incident and said that they had no intention of cheating any one. Sachin Kshirsagar (25) of Bombay Launch Services Ltd, who owned the barges provided to Gupta, was arrested on January 2.

He, too, was released on bail. The police are now questioning all the accused again to ascertain their role in the event. The police have recorded the statement of Anil Garg of Dynamo Communications, the company which provided infrastructure for the event. â€œHe does not seem to have played a role in the mismanagement of the event,â€™â€™ an officer said. While speaking to this paper,Mr Garg denied Guptaâ€™s allegations that Dynamo had hyped the event. â€œWe were not in-charge of publicity or managing the event. We were only supposed to provide the barges and extend technical assistance for the display screens and music systems which we didâ€™â€™ Mr Garg said.

He said that the first boat carrying revellers had reached the barge by 9.40 p.m. but Gupta had failed to arrange for the DJs. â€œThe music system was ready but there was nobody to play it.â€™â€™ Mr Garg also said that there was some misunderstanding regarding the serving of alcohol on the barge and this had angered several of the guests, some of whom had turned violent.

16,BJP sets up group of ministers for northeast polls,"NEW DELHI: The BJP, which has a marginal presence in the north east, despite concerted work by the RSS in that region, has formed a group of ministers to try and make a beginning in next month's assembly elections in Meghalaya, Tripura and Nagaland. The group, headed by Disinvestment Minister Arun Shourie - also the designated minister for the north east - has six other ministers of state in it, BC Khanduri, Rajiv Pratap Rudy, Ravi Shankar Prasad, Bijoya Chakravarty, Tapan Sikdar and MK Annasaheb Patil. BJP sources said that while the political situation in the three states varied and demanded different electoral strategies, the party would focus in its election campaign on the centrally sponsored development projects for the north east, the fact that the BJP-led NDA government has appointed a cabinet minister specially for the north east, and a north east council headed by the governor of Assam. The tricky and controversial issues of cultural nationalism, conversions and militancy will not be highlighted by the BJP, sources said, unless other parties raised them. In Nagaland, for instance, the role currently being played by the Centre in the peace process and the talks with the various insurgent groups will be a factor; cultural nationalism and conversions may not be an appropriate issue in a Christian-majority state. The decision to form the group for the north east was taken when party president M Venkaiah Naidu and party functionary in charge of the north east Pyarelal Khandelwal met here on Tuesday. The choice of ministers was made, keeping an eye on a mix of those fluent in English - apart from Shourie, the cabinet minister for the north east, Prasad, Rudy and Khanduri - Chakravarty because she is from Assam, Sikdar because as a Bengali, he can address the interests of the community in Tripura and Patil because he is the MOS for rural development.
