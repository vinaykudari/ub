The association of doctors of ESIS has now complained to the health department that Dr Kumbhare should be suspended immediately.

1,BKS members clash near Sena Bhavan,"MUMBAI: The clash between two factions of the Shiv Sena- controlled trade union, Bharatiya Kamgar Sena (BKS), near Sena Bhavan on Thursday evening was an outburst against the unionâ€™s policy of foisting handpicked appointees as members, it is learnt. The activists were the employees of Hotel Oberoi in which the BKS has a unit.

The clash occurred when the rival faction, which is opposed to the continuance of Vijay Walawalkar as secretary of the Hotel Oberoi unit, failed to extract an assurance from the union secretary Jaywant Parab that the pliant 19-member executive should be replaced with the one which would mirror the â€œaspirationsâ€™â€™ of 1,500 employees of Hotel Oberoi, sources said.

The BKS leadership had summoned the two groups to Sena Bhavan for talks, it is learnt. â€œWe were close to defusing the crisis when something went wrong and there was an altercation. Such cases are not unusual in the field of trade unionism,â€™â€™ said BKS general secretary Krishnakant Kondlekar.

While admitting that the acrimony had underscored the need for greater transparency in the appointment of office- bearers in various BKS units, Mr Kondlekar, however, denied that the clash was symptomatic of rampant groupism in BKS which has units in premiere establishments such as Mahindra and Mahindra, Bajaj Auto, Larsen & Toubro, Lilavati hospital and Hotel Oberoi, to name a few.

â€œOur time-honoured practice is to ask our members to choose their executive in a democratic manner. When this is not possible we select functionaries. It is likely that something went wrong with the process of selection in the case of Hotel Oberoi,â€™â€™ Mr Kondlekar said.

Inquiries revealed that BKS secretary Jaywant Parab had called both the groups to the party headquarters to settle the issue amicably. Soon, a few union members began quarrelling among themselves and Mr Parab was unable to control them.

A couple of workers were manhandled following which the Shivaji Park police was called in.

Senior inspector T.S. Loni, who visited Sena Bhavan and brought the situation under control, said that his officers had registered cross complaints and issued warnings to both the groups. â€œI am surprised why the Sena leaders or union workers had not informed the local police about the meeting. I am issuing notices to Sena leaders in this connection,â€™â€™ he told TNN on Friday.

2,Tailor arrested for human sacrifice,"THANE: The Dombivli police on Thursday arrested a Ambernath-based tailor, Anil Singh (32), for allegedly killing his neighbourâ€™s nine-year old son, Rahul Soni. Singh murdered the child reportedly on the advice of a tantrik, Baba Akram Abdul Sattar alias Baba Bengali, who too has been arrested.

Police inspector Shamsher Khan Pathan, said there were frequent quarrels between Singh and his family members and so he had sought the advice of the Bandra-based Baba Sattar to help him ease the tensions at home.

The police said the Baba reportedly instructed Singh to sacrifice a young child to earn peace with his family.

On June 21, on the pretext of taking the boy for a stroll, Singh took Rahul to a forest on the outskirts of Ambernath.

Rahul was never to be seen again. The police said the the tailor allegedly slit the boyâ€™s throat with a knife and left his body there.

Meanwhile, the Soni family, worried over their sonâ€™s disappearance, lodged a â€˜missingâ€™ complaint with the police.

Two days later, the police found a headless body of a young boy, which turned out to be that of Rahulâ€™s.

The Soni family had mentioned in the police complaint that their son was last seen with Singh.

Before the police could nab him, Singh absconded.

He was finally tracked down at Dombivli. During interrogation, he reportedly confessed to killing Rahul.

The police recovered the murder weapon from Singhâ€™s house.

3,"Laloo, Mishra hit out at domicile policy","PATNA: RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav has accused Jharkhand CM Babulal Marandi of misquoting the labour department notification of Bihar of 1982 to justify the stateâ€™s controversial domicile policy which, he insisted will trigger off a civil war in the state.

â€œThe 1982 notification of Biharâ€™s labour department is applicable for employment in private companies and factories and not for government jobs and reservation in educational institutesâ€�, Laloo stressed while speaking to mediapersons. He demanded its withdrawal alleging that it was a violation of article 16 of the Indian Constitution providing for equality in government jobs.

He pointed out that after the implementation of Public Employment (Requirement as to Residence) Act, 1957, Parliament had abolished all rules and instructions requiring residence for public employment. The state governments were not entitled to make laws related to giving employment on domicile grounds, he stressed. â€œOnly Parliament is the competent body to legislate such lawsâ€�, he remarked. He said that Jharkhandâ€™s domicile policy had sparked off violence in the state. â€œJharkhand was going the Assam wayâ€�, he stated insisiting that the stateâ€™s new domicile policy will entitle other states and places like Mumbai, Delhi and Kolkata from banning employment of people of other states. â€œJharkhand is burning and is engulfed in ethnic violenceâ€�, he stressed, asking the Jharkhand government to withdraw its decision., adding the law would isolate tribals.

On the new railway zone, he insisted that the decision of the Union railway ministry remained unchanged. â€œThe new railway zone will start functioning from October 1â€�, he remarked insisting that there was no enmity between the people of West Bengal, Bihar and UP. NCP leader Jagannath Mishra also criticised Jharkhandâ€™s new domicile policy. â€œThe people of the state have been divided into pre and post 1932 domicilesâ€�, he stated.

4,No withdrawal of support to govt: BJP,"LUCKNOW: The BJP state president on Friday ruled out the party withdrawing support from the BSP-BJP coalition government headed by Mayawati.

Scotching rumours which emanated from the stormy BJP legislature party meeting on Sunday last, Vinay Katiyar said that there was no reason for the party to pull out of the government.

Party MLAs had reportedly favoured outside support as the Mayawati government was pursuing only her Dalit agenda. He denied it, saying: â€œ Sarkar coalition agenda se hi chalegi na ki Mayawati ke agenda se (the government would run on the coalition agenda and not of Mayawati).â€� He claed that support withdrawal demand was never raised during the legislature party meeting.

The BJP state chief, however, looked annoyed over party ministers failing to keep pace with the organisation.

5,Congress fear violence during BJP called bandh,"NEW DELHI: Expressing fears that BJP might resort to violence during its July 22 bandh, the city unit of Congress on Friday sought an ""impartial role"" of Delhi police in thwarting any such attempt.

""The people of Delhi feel unsafe whenever BJP calls for a bandh as anti-social elements are employed to intimidate people. We request you not to succumb to political pressure from the Central Government,"" a memorandum submitted by a DPCC delegation led by DPCC president Subhash Chopra to Delhi Police chief R S Gupta, said.

Chopra said that there was apprehension that BJP would use force ""to terrorise people and submit them to downing shutters of their shops and business establishments in different parts of Delhi.""

""Shops in commercial markets and business establishments are forced to down their shutters and vandalism is unleashed on the street, public places and on public property,"" it said.

Requesting additional police force on that day, he said that this would help in ""keeping the BJP cadre and anti-social elements in check.""

The delegation also apprised Gupta about the information that police was putting pressure on theatre owners to suspend shows on the day of the bandh.

The BJP has given a bandh call on July 22 to protest against the grim power situation in the capital.

7,Gujarat announces gas distribution policy,"GANDHINAGAR: The Gujarat government on Thursday declared a new policy for gas distribution in the state.

In order to develop gas distribution networks, the government has decided to encourage and invite private sector participation and investment in the development of gas distribution infrastructure.

The Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation (GSPC) will act as the nodal agency for all matters related to gas pipelines.

Parties interested in undertaking gas distribution projects in Gujarat will have to send their proposals to GSPC. Interested parties will be required to give security deposit of up to Rs 1 crore alongwith the application.

After scrutiny of the application, GSPC shall issue an NOC to such applicants within three months. Upon receiving an NOC from GSPC, a company can undertake the development of gas distribution pipelines. Each and every NOC receiving company shall have to abide by certain conditions.

Gas production in the state, especially in the private sector like GSPC/Niko consortium project, Cairn Energy, etc, is likely to increase in the near future.

LNG import terminals are also being set up in the state in Hazira and Dahej. Regassified LNG is likely to be available in Gujarat by 2004.

GSPL has developed more than 100 km of pipelines from Hazira upwards. Work is in progress on various sections of this pipeline. Pipelines shall be developed up to Vadodara by March 2003 end and up to Ahmedabad by December 2003. Simultaneously, gas pipelines shall also be developed in the Saurashtra region.

As a result, majority of pipeline infrastructure for gas distribution shall be ready by 2004. So when LNG arrives on the shores of Gujarat, it shall be speedily evacuated to all parts of the state.

Explaining the need for the policy, a government spokesman said that gas distribution pipelines in the state were required for safeguarding the environment, in the interest of the general public and for economic development.

Such distribution networks should be ready by the time gas becomes available as LNG. Proposals are being received for development of gas distribution zones in the State. However, since a clear-cut policy on gas distribution was lacking so far, it was difficult to process the proposals.

The main objectives behind having a distribution policy were to ensure development of gas distribution zones across the rural and urban areas in the state by 2005, to ensure competition in the market and to protect the consumer interests, to preserve the environment, to provide piped gas for domestic purposes and to promote investment to the tune of Rs 1,000 to Rs 1,500 crore in distribution infrastructure.

8,Farooq will stay CM till elections,"SRINAGAR: Dispelling speculation about his retirement from politics, Chief Minister Farooq Abdullah has said that he would contest the forthcoming Assembly elections as well.

""I will fight the coming elections as chief minister. I had decided to retire from active politics but party workers insisted that I should continue till the elections,"" he said on the concluding day of the last session of the present legislature.

He, however, did not clarify whether he would be in the running for the top post of the state after the elections.

Though he has repeatedly stated that he will retire from politics, his statement on Friday effectively puts to rest speculation that his son and Minister of state for external affairs Omar Abdullah would succeed him as the chief minister ahead of elections.

The grant of greater autonomy to the state is under active consideration of the Centre, he said in the assembly. Replying to a question on the issue, he said the Centre has already appointed Arun Jaitly as emissary to discuss the matter with the state government.

He added that Modi-u-din Shah, a minister in his government, would, after the assembly session, discuss the autonomy report with the Central leaders.

M Yousuf Tarigami, the lone CPM MLA in the assembly intervening in the discussion, asked whether the state government has agreed to accept the autonomy resolution partially as reported by the media.

Denying the reports, he told the House that the discussion would be on the resolution adopted by both the Houses last year and forwarded to the Centre. No compromise would be made.

9,Strong support for Bill to curb domestic violence,"NEW DELHI: A private member''s Bill to curb domestic violence garnered support in the Rajya Sabha on Friday with Shabana Azmi (Ind) suggesting the government at least refer the Bill to the standing committee.

The government Bill, that left women organisation''s upset, has been referred to the standing committee.

The private Bill, piloted by Sarla Maheshwari (CPM), seeks to counter the growing menace of domestic violence and in particular, empower courts to grant protection orders to victims of such violence.

Women organisations have described the government''s Bill as one ""justifying battery"", and are objecting to the definition of domestic violence and the escape clauses in the Bill.

With Maheshwari setting the tone, Azmi picked up the baton later to demand the inclusion of what women''s groups have termed non-negotiables, such as the definition of domestic violence, a woman''s right to reside in a shared household and mandatory counselling of the abuser, not the victim.

Domestic violence is universal but not customarily acknowledged, said Azmi. One in every three women, she said, has experienced violence in an intimate relationship at some point. A number of incidents are never reported. In India, the situation is worse, with women wilting under societal prejudices and the constant pressure to keep a marriage going.

While most MPs emphasised the need for education and mindset changes, DMK''s CP Thirunav-ukkarasu said domestic harassment could be inflicted on men as well. The definition of aggrieved person should include men, he suggested.

The same point was stressed by BJP''s Sangh Priya Gautam, who suggested the Bill remain centred on the fact of domestic violence, ""Women alone are not the sufferers,"" he said.

10,Riot toll still ticking away with spate of suicides,"AHMEDABAD : The situation might have returned to ""normal"", but the death toll is still ticking. In the past 45 days, 18 suicide cases have been reported in the city and a majority of these cases are directly related to loss of business in a riot-torn city.

Shailesh Panchal is a distraught man today. His wife Meena immolated herself along with their three children on June 25. Riots delivered a body blow to his 10-year-old printing business as he failed to get any kind of order in the last four months. With a seven member family, including ailing parents to feed, there was absolutely no hope.

Narendra Patel and three other family members ended their lives in a guest house near Gita Mandir in Ahmedabad on June 3. Patel was in the dairy business that was badly hit in the recent riots forcing his family to take such a drastic step.

Popat Prajapati along with his wife and two sons hanged themselves at their Naroda-Kathwada residence on July 12. His book-binding business suffered heavy losses - thanks to the communal carnage.

""First came the earthquake. Then the riots. We had virtually no orders in the past four months,"" says Shailesh Panchal, who joined the family business after quitting his job. ""With a job, at least, you are assured of a fixed income. How long can one survive on meagre savings? It has been a real tough time in the last four months,"" he says with tears running down his cheeks.

According to family members, Meena who used to help her husband in the business, took the extreme step following her helplessness to pay the school fees of her twin daughters. ""How can I live without my young son?"" says Panchal, looking blankly at a family photograph.

Talking about the sudden rise in such cases in the city, Additional Commissioner of Police, Satish Sharma says, ""It is difficult to jump to any conclusion but undoubtedly we have come across such cases in the last few days.""

""Most of these suicides are by members of the majority community, who were devastated by the economic fallout of the riots,"" says an analyst. He adds: "" Those who did not find anything wrong with the riots should note this, it was not the minority alone who were affected but the majority community members too.""

""It''s quite natural that when people suffer economic losses or they do not have work, they feel depressed. These suicide cases are also a manifestation of post traumatic stress order. Economic uncertainty can lead to severe depression that sometimes leads to suicide. In the post-riots period, things have been really difficult for many and huge business losses have forced many to end their lives along with family members,"" says Sohan Derasari, a psychiatrist.

It is not easy for somebody who has lost his daily bread, but suicide is not something that a person resorts to easily. This means that for each one who has committed suicde there are hundreds who are still suffering in agony.

11,Can EC decline to hold early polls in Gujarat?,"NEW DELHI: Can the Election Commission (EC), on grounds of law and order, decline to hold early elections to a state assembly, overruling Union and state administrations?

G V G Krishnamurty, the legal expert who served eight years as a member in the EC during the tenures of TN Seshan and MS Gill, has no doubts. ""It is the EC''s prerogative to decide when to hold an election, fixing the date after checking the ground realities, starting with law and order. The responsibility is to the electorate, not the party or Prime Minister of the day. We were diplomatic, but firm, on such pressures (Punjab, Kashmir, etc) in the past,"" he told Times News Network.

The EC is normally expected to organise elections to enable a new House to be in place before six months elapse from the date of dissolution. There is no provision in the Constitution saying so: the practice has grown from two constitutional provisions on related subjects.

An Assembly must be summoned, says Article 174(1), within six months of the previous sitting (this actually refers to sittings in the same five-year term). And Article 164(4) says no minister shall continue in office beyond six months of ceasing to be a member of a state legislature.

And so, the six-month limit for a new poll has come to have the force of law.

Both these articles are in Part VI, the section on state legislatures, not in Part XIV relating to elections and their conduct. Art 324(1) simply says the EC will control this entire process, for polls to Parliament and state legislatures.

In normal times, this means the EC will check law and order, availability of Union and state police and para-military forces, the weather, availability of teachers (government schools are always polling booths) and exam schedules and the absence of any natural calamity or problem, and fix the dates within this six-month period. But what happens when any of these factors pose a problem beyond the six-month stretch?

The only answer in the Constitution comes from Part XVIII, on emergency provisions. Which envisages Union takeover, or direction, of a state administration, to protect security.

Approval by each of the two Houses of Parliament, with a renewal of the okay every six months, upto a maximum of three years. With the EC''s concurrence beyond the second six-month extension; it has to also certify that elections are not possible in this situation.

In other words, the EC, Union government, Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha have to all concur. The Gujarat situation is not directly addressed in the Constitution; if tested, it would be a first.

13,Don't yield to BJP pressure on Gujarat polls: CPM to EC,"NEW DELHI: Condemning the Gujarat government''s decision to dissolve the Assembly, CPM on Saturday asked the Election Commission ""not to be pressured"" by the BJP move and demanded that elections should not be held now as normalcy was yet to be restored in the state.

""The Chief Election Commissioner has recently gone on record boldly and correctly to state that early elections in Gujarat cannot be forced on the Commission,"" the party politburo said in a statement.

It asked the EC ""not to be pressured by the cynical moves of the BJP state government"" and said the dissolution was ordered ""to force an early election so that the BJP can exploit to its political advantage, the sharply polarised communal situation in the state"".

Stating that the present term of the state government expires only in March next year, the CPM said many other parties had also held that ""until normalcy is restored and proper rehabilitation of the lakhs of victims of the worst state-sponsored communal carnage that India has seen in recent years is completed, the elections should not be held"".

14,Manipur govt not to withdraw charges against NSCN(I-M),"MUMBAI: Despite Nagaland government''s withdrawal of warrants of arrest against NSCN(I-M) leaders to enable them to arrive in India to participate in formal negotations with the Centre, the Manipur government on Saturday virtually threw a spanner to the peace process, saying it will not withdraw the cases against them.

""We will not give up,"" Manipur Chief Minister Ibomi Singh, who is here to participate at North-east Chief Ministers'' summit, said adding the ceasefire between NSCN(I-M) and Centre was confined to the state of Nagaland only. NSCN (I-M) Chairman Isak Chishi Swu and General Secretary Thuingaleng Muivah gave a written assurance on July 11 to Prime Minister''s special emissary K Padmanabhaiah in Amsterdam that they would come to India to hold further talks.

Political dialogue between Centre and NSCN(I-M), which began in February 1997 followed by ceasefire from August that year, was held so far abroad, mostly in Bangkok and Amsterdam. The Manipur chief minister''s assertion assumes significance as Muivah, considered the key architect of his outfit, belongs to Tangkhul Naga tribe and hails from the hill district of Ukhrul in Manipur.

In Manipur, Tangkhul Nagas are known for love-hate relation with Kukis and Metei Manipuris, who inhabit the valley and form most of the electorate of the state. NSCN (I-M) is allegedly involved in several ethnic clashes in the hill districts of Ukhrul and Senapati.

15,I'm not against development: Ananthamurthy,"BANGALORE: Jnanpith award recipient U.R. Ananthamurthy had a lot to talk about development at a programme -- ``Maneyangaladalli Maathukathe'''' (a discussion in the courtyard) -- organised by the Kannada and culture department on Saturday.

``I am not against development per se, but I am for that kind of development which brings out total good to the maximum and causes least distress to the minimum,'''' Ananthamurthy said when asked why he opposed Kudremukh iron ore project.

``Continuation of this project will have disastrous effect on the environment for several centuries to come, whereas the employees can either be rehabilitated or given compensation,'''' he argued.

Expressing his deep concern over the brain drain of engineers and scientists from India to the West, Ananthamurthy said the West today needs artisans like drivers, barbers, cooks and maidservants. ``I made my son come back to India. But I do not know if I could stop him from going once again,'''' he admitted.

16,Ex- minister Kashappanavar seeks police protection,"BANGALORE: Dropped minister S.R. Kashappanavar has submitted a letter to Assembly Speaker M.V. Venkatappa seeking police protection, following what he claims a threat from Urban Development Minister D.K. Shivakumar.

In the handwritten letter, dated July 18, Kashappanavar alleged that Shivakumar accosted him in the Assembly lobby and later in the ministers'' lounge on July 17 and in an intimidating manner asked: ``Are you going to demonstrate your strength?''''

A copy of Kashappanavar''s letter was made available to this paper.

Kashappanavar, in the letter, said Shivakumar''s tone and tenor had shaken him and affected his health. ``My constituency is 430 km from Bangalore and I have no one here but my wife. I am frightened and seek protection from you,'''' he added.

Shivakumar was not available for comment as he was away in his constituency. However, a close aide who was present when the incident took place, said there was only a verbal duel between the two.

``Shivakumar only asked Kashappanavar are you going to organise a show of strength. The latter retorted by saying I will see that Krishna and you are removed,'''' the aide said.

When contacted, Venkatappa said Kashappanavar spoke to him over phone on Saturday. ``Any action will be only after hearing Shivakumar''s version. We have provided police protection to expelled BJP MLA Gundappa Vakil. As Speaker, I can write to the home department which has to do the needful,'''' he said.

17,Admn sleeps on case against ex-minister,"BATHINDA: One thousand eight hundred square yards of prime land in the town is encroached upon by a minister and his relative. Punjab Urban Development Authority (PUDA), which owns the land, does not recommend legal action against them. Four years and a change of government later, a case is finally got registered but instead of initiating criminal action what does the district administration do? To all intents and purposes, it continues to twiddle its thumbs.

The plot in question had been allegedly grabbed by Chiranjee Lal Garg, former science and technology minister, and his relative Megh Raj in March 1998.

Once the land had been occupied, a boundary wall was raised and a gate was installed. While PUDA authorities reportedly kept mum to avoid a confrontation with the then minister, a local social worker, NK Garg, filed a civil suit against the minister and his relative in March 2001.

Before the suit could be settled, the Akali-BJP government was ousted and PUDA authorities found the courage to move against the former minister. In the first week of June, this year, they asked the deputy commissioner of Bathinda to take strict penal action against Chiranjee Lal Garg and his relative for criminal trespass and encroaching upon PUDA land.

PUDA authorities wrote that the act of encroachment by the former cabinet minister was unwarranted, illegal, a corrupt practice and amounted to misuse of official power.

It is over a month since PUDA recommended action but the district authorities are still sleeping on the file. While the deputy commissioner of Bathinda was not available for comment, GK Singh, additional deputy commissioner, denied knowledge of the case.

NK Garg, however, says the administration is not taking any action against the former minister, despite clinching evidence, due to his political connections.

18,2 Cong ministers set to go scot-free,"CHANDIGARH: Thanks to lackadaisical approach of the then Badal government in dealing with corruption, the two Congress ministers, Harbans Lal and Ramesh Dutt Sharma, found guilty of procuring fake medical practitioner certificates, would go scot free when the vigilance bureau (VB) files challan in the case.

Both the ministers are among 88 persons who submitted false affidavits regarding their age and residential address to procure ayurvedic medical practitioner certificate from Jammu and Kashmir on the basis of which they fraudulently got themselves enlisted as registered medical practitioners (RMPs) in Punjab. Whatever be the political implications of this, the VB case against the two ministers is expected to come a cropper as the then Badal government had declined permission to prosecute them.

Harbans Lal is the minister of state for forests and Ramesh Dutt Sharma is the minister of state for medical research and education.

While the former was an MLA from the Sirhind assembly constituency when the VB initiated investigation in the case, the latter was listed as a former MLA from the Anandpur Sahib constituency.

According to official sources, in this case the VB proposes to file challan against four persons, Kulwant Singh Sohi, former registrar of the state ayurvedic board; Yogesh Sharma, Harbhajan Singh Yogi and Auyodhya Prasad, all members of the board committee that was constituted to testify the authenticity of registration of the two ministers and others in J-K.

They have been accused of submitting false certification even as none of them was resident of J-K. The VB had registered the case in 1997 and completed its investigation in 2000 when it sought permission to prosecute the two ministers. But the Badal government had turned down its request in spite of the fact that there was tenable evidence to establish the guilt of the two ministers.

20,Dhumal rules out early election in HP,"NEW DELHI: Himachal Pradesh chief minister Prem Kumar Dhumal on Saturday ruled out the possibility of holding a snap poll in the state.

â€œThere is no proposal of holding polls to the Himachal Vidhan Sabha along with the election to the Gujarat assembly,â€� he said here on arrival from Shimla, dismissing media speculation in this regard.

Maintaining that his government would complete its full term, he said the election would be held in March when the term of the Vidhan Sabha expires. While welcoming the decision of the Modi government to hold early assembly polls in Gujarat, Dhumal said it had become essential as â€œthe opposition parties have vitiated the atmosphere in Gujarat by politicising communal riots to gain political mileage.â€�

Early elections in Gujarat would give a â€œbefitting reply to divisive forces and strengthen the hands of patriotic people in the state,â€� he said.

Dhumal justified his governmentâ€™s proposal for creating new districts in Himachal saying it would help in rationalising distribution of assembly seats. At present half of the 68 Vidhan Sabha constituencies fall within three districts while the remaining half are spread over nine other districts. The state government has mooted a proposal to create at least three new districts in the state which is yet to be placed before the cabinet.

However, the opposition parties have criticised the move terming it as a poll plank just before the assembly election. The chief minister said reorganisation of the districts would facilitate administrative convenience as people in some areas have to travel a long distance to reach the district headquarters to get their work done. Dhumal came down heavily on the state Congress leaders for enhancing the support price for apple and announcing various other subsidies to the farmers, saying their criticism gave an impression that â€œsavings achieved by the state should not be passed on to the farmersâ€�.

â€œOur government has always extended every possible help and facilities to the farmers and the market intervention scheme has been launched for the first time to mango growers as the benefit earlier was confined to apple and other fruit growers,â€� he said.

The government has formulated a plan to set up 18 fruit markets in the state to provide direct sale facilities to the growers and eliminate the role of commission agents, said the chief minister, adding this would benefit both farmers and the consumers.

Stating that all regions in the state were getting equal distribution of developmental funds, he said â€œBJP government has been successful in dismantling regionalism and binding people of the state emotionallyâ€�.
