""there is no reason to dismiss this government and it is not easy to do away with an elected government,"" she said. she said that the government would be sending reports to the governor c rangarajan, while the state chief secretary p shankar would personally brief the governor on the situation leading to the violence. deserting her usual efforts to rebuke the journalists at any meetings, press conferences or public meetings, jayalalitha on monday sought to apologise for the police attack on the mediapersons who were covering the violence. she termed the attack on the journalists as unfortunate and promised to take steps to prevent recurrence of such incidents. ""i am distressed to hear that media was attacked. they might have been caught between the arsonists and the police,"" she said. she added that a suitable procedure is being drawn out to ensure that the media is not attacked in future. the commission of inquiry would also look into the damage to the equipment of the scribes. in a separate statement to announce the institution of the commission, jayalalitha accused the dmk chief and former chief minister m karunanidhi of taking a recourse to the 'culture of violence' to get her duly elected government dismissed. there was no time frame given for the commission to submit its report. she charged karunanidhi of instigating the violence as part of 'dmk culture' and that it was planned violence. expressing her sympathies for the victims of sunday's violence, jayalalitha also announced a solatium of rs 50,000 for the next of kin of those dead and rs 15,000 to those injured. meanwhile, karunanidhi who met the governor at the raj bhavan told reporters that it was the aiadmk rowdies who joined hands with the police that created the violence. he too accused the aiadmk of planning the violence with the help of the ayodhya kuppam rowdies who allegedly attacked the dmk processionists. he claimed that he had proper evidence of the rowdy-police nexus as many of the victims admitted in the two government hospitals bore injuries from knives and other sharp weapons. ""no dmk man will stab his fellow cadre,"" he said in response to jayalalitha's charge that violence was instigated by the dmk. ""this only proves that it is the handiwork of the opponents,"" he added. he said his party was not pressing for the dismissal of the jayalalitha government, but was seeking centre's help in bringing down the atrocities of the government. the state bjp, the mdmk and the cpi(m) have also demanded judicial probe into the incident, especially the police attack on journalists and their firing at the rallyists. the bjp in fact demanded a probe by the centre. mdmk chief vaiko termed the attack on the mediapersons by the police as 'attack on the foundation of democracy'.

13,'State govt is facing grim financial situation',"mumbai: maharashtra chief minister vilasrao deshmukh said here on monday that his government was facing a grim financial situation because of the huge loans taken by the erstwhile shiv sena-bjp government, the fifth pay commission recommendations and severe drought in several districts of the state. he said the saffron alliance had left behind a loan burden of rs 48,000 crore whereas the congress ministry which preceded it had created a loan liability of only rs 16,000 crore. he said the implementation of the fifth pay commission recommendations had imposed a burden of rs 5,500 crore. the serious drought situation had also compelled the government to divert funds to face the crisis. he said his government had taken several tough decisions, including a freeze on dearness allowance and stoppage of bonus, to improve the financial health of the state. the decisions on da and bonus alone had resulted in a saving of rs 1,000 crore. despite these challenges, he expressed confidence that the eight-party democratic front coalition headed by him would complete its five-year term. the government will complete two years in office in october. mr deshmukh was speaking informally to journalists at the times of india building. he said that unlike some other states, where the congress was in a majority, he was leading a coalition with a thin margin in maharashtra, which made the task of governance difficult. he said attempts to destabilise his government had failed. referring to reports that bribes of crores of rupees were offered to some mlas to defect, he said some forces had increased their purchasing power at the cost of the state. the reference appeared to be to the corruption indulged in by the erstwhile sena-bjp government. however, the political culture of maharashtra was different, he said, and efforts to destabilise his government on the basis of money power were certain to fail. when asked why his cash-strapped government was giving real estate worth several crores of rupees at nariman point to the s.b. chavan trust for a song, mr deshmukh replied, wryly, that a situation had not been reached whereby the government had to sell its land to raise money. when it was pointed out that the trust was reportedly not even registered when the plot was allotted to it, mr deshmukh insisted that all the necessary procedures had been followed before making the allotment. in reply to a question regarding the tinaikar committee's investigations into corruption in the slum redevelopment scheme initiated by the sena-bjp government, the cm said the issue would come up before the cabinet and a decision would be taken soon. ``the democratic front coalition is working well, but next time we in the congress should come back to power on our own,'' mr deshmukh said. several reforms had been introduced in the field of information technology and other sectors. maharashtra was the only state developing two it centres, mumbai and pune, unlike other states which were focusing on only one city. ``the only problem is that we are not as savvy as andhra pradesh in marketing our achievements,'' he said. a bill on disinvestment had been introduced in the legislature. a committee had been appointed under the chairmanship of former chief secretary sharad upasani to recommend the rehabilitation or winding up of certain state corporations. the decision of the committee would be binding on the cabinet. regarding the controversial dabhol power project, mr deshmukh said the mnc had already expressed its intention to pull out of the venture. he said it was now for the centre to decide who should buy enron's stake in the company. he said it was not possible to stop the influx of people into mumbai but steps were being taken to prevent the growth of slums in the commercial capital. mr deshmukh said the erection of illegal structures had been made a cognisable and non-bailable offence. protection would be given to all hutments which had come up before january 1, 1995. but the government would take tough action against structures which had come up after the cut-off date. officials of the police and other departments would be held personally responsible should illegal structures spring up in areas which come under their jurisdiction. a special grant of rs 1,300 crore was also being sought for the city from the centre. unfortunately, backward states were getting more allocation from the finance commission and better performing states, like maharashtra, were being penalised for their performance, mr deshmukh said. as a result, maharashtra had to suffer along with other states like andhra pradesh, karnataka and tamil nadu. he said if other states like uttar pradesh developed rapidly, the influx of people from there into mumbai would be reduced. as for the threatened strike by civic workers in mumbai, it was for the municipal corporation to solve the problem, he said. curiously, class iii and iv employees of the bmc received 40 per cent more in wages than did state government employees in the same category, he said. mr deshmukh deplored the recent attack on a christian priest in thane district. stern action would be taken against communal elements who were trying to create trouble on the eve of elections to the municipal corporations and zilla parishads, he said. in response to a question regarding attacks by congress activists on college principals, he said these had taken place against the background of shortage of seats for admissions. nevertheless, no one should be allowed to take the law into their own hands.

18,Old Hubli tense after clashes,"hubli: the old hubli area in the twin cities has turned into a sensitive pocket, following recent clashes. if the first major clash was over property, leading to lathi-charge, firing, arson and looting, the other two incidents were over ""trivial"" matters. what is giving the police sleepless nights here is the attempt by vested interests to give a communal colour even to a roadside argument. this was proved right when mohammed sadiq of islampur in hubli, an employee of kptcl, appeared before the police on monday. sadiq, with head injuries, is said to be one of the victims of friday night's clash in durgad bail area leading to tense hours in the twin cities. he has lodged a complaint against the other group in which former bjp corporator nandagopal sapare is also a party. police sources told the times of india, it was sadiq who was first attacked by the rival group over smoking a cigarette. in fact, sources added, sadiq did not want to lodge a complaint but was forced to following the rival group creating a wrong impression that sapare was the ""victim"". it is believed an ego clash had snowballed into a controversy, with bjp and bajrang dal activists joining the fray. it may be recalled that sapare along with friends were dining in a hotel late night, when sapare objected to sadiq lighting a cigarette. this led to heated argument between the two. sadiq and his followers were caught unawares the next day, when supporters of sapare staged a protest in front of the police commissioner's office demanding action against the ""culprits"". the state convenor of bajrang dal mutalik, and bjp corporators led the protest. on monday, the muslim community leaders met police officers and demanded action against ""troublemongers"" for the friday night incident. the delegation consisted of anwar mudhol, corporator altaf kittur, former dy mayor altaf hallur, shafi muddebihal, mohideen jamkhanwale and others. it may be remembered that after the major clash over the hotel some time ago, ne more incident was reported in kamripeth area. this was also a fight between two armed and inebriated groups, which later turned into a communal clash. the police commissioner y.r. patil has already written to the government about the ""sensitive nature"" of the area. when contacted, patil asserted, the police department was all prepared to tackle any situation. he added that there was no need for extra reinforcements at the moment.

""school buildings need repairs and the government says it has no funds,"" they said, adding that ""when we cannot provide basic facilities to students how can we convince their parents to send them to schools regularly?"" they quipped. by shifting the responsibility to the state government the primary school teachers tried to make it clear that they were not responsible for the failure of the drive. but they evaded reply when asked why they always preferred postings near their home towns or villages.

21,Police clueless about woman's suicide motive,"pune: the deccan police are still clueless about the motive behind sana sheikh setting herself ablaze outside mangala theatre in full public view on friday night. no relative of hers has so far come forward to claim the body. rickshaw drivers, who were waiting outside the cinema hall, informed the deccan gymkhana police about the incident. she was rushed to sassoon hospital, where she died while undergoing treatment. according to sources at the police station, sana had married notorious goon sabir sheikh, who was externed from pune, about eight years ago. sabir's body was found in a well in lonavla a few months back and the pune rural police are yet to solve the mystery behind his death. sana, who hails from chembur in mumbai, was mentally disturbed after sabir's death and his parents, who had not approved of their marriage, were not ready to support her, the sources said. a police team has gone to chembur to make inquiries about sana's relatives based on some address they procured.

22,Rajnath may fire some more ministers,"lucknow: if the subtle signals emanating from 4, kalidas marg, official residence of chief minister rajnath singh in lucknow, provide any indication, seven more members of the jumbo ministry whose individual image is allegedly as malignant as that of naresh agrawal may be sacked sooner than later in election-bound uttar pradesh. two of the ministers on the proposed firing line happen to be old-timers of the bjp. the chief minister appears to be vibrating with fresh energy in the aftermath of the sacking of his power minister. he seems to have grown taller in stature. all his intra-party rivals and all his allies have apparently fallen in line. there is hardly any dissenting voice in the government at this point of time. obviously, it is fear that has replaced indiscipline and suddenly everything looks orderly in the otherwise lawless corridors of power in lucknow. gone are the days when junior ministers used to hold separate conclaves to voice their protest against lack of files on their tables. they are all now busy expressing faith in the leadership of rajnath. but all this apart, the sacking of agarwal is unlikely to cause any major upheaval in up politics for three reasons: first, the dropped power minister doesn't have any vote bank under his command. without power, he is worth nothing to his friends and foes. he may meet mulayam singh yadav and kalyan singh time and again but chances are that he wouldn't be given entry into either the samajwadi party or the rashtriya kranti dal. it's a different thing if these leaders use him for exposure purposes against the rajnath government. agrawal's vaishya community is, in any case, disenchanted with the bjp, thanks to the market conditions in the country as a whole. secondly, the political battle lines in the state are already too clearly drawn. while the samajwadi party appears to be going great guns having further consolidated its vote bank of backwards and muslims, the bahujan samaj party's strength looks unaffected despite the state government's move to give the benefit of reservation to what is known as the most backward classes. what has added poignancy to the bjp's problems is the fact that the middle classes are no longer backing the saffron cause as solidly as they did in the early 1990s. a section of this otherwise reliable vote bank has gone to the samajwadi party and the congress. perhaps that was why the bjp came a poor fourth in the shahjahanpur lok sabha byelection earlier this year. and finally, the powers-that-be in the bjp are still undecided on how to stem the rot under the circumstances. it is significant that the rss has criticised rajnath's move to provide special reservation to the mbcs. ""the state government might feel that the decision would help them win elections, but its their feeling not ours,"" rss spokesman m g vaidya said, adding that his organisation didn't believe in dividing a nation on the basis of caste. not too long ago, kushabhau thakre, who looks after bjp affairs in up, had also described the new reservation policy as a double-edged sword. little wonder then that the initial euphoria in bjp circles over the sacking of agarwal is dying down faster than expected. the cold realisation is that the party has to look for fresh aces. and the election is not too far away.

23,WHO workshop to help prevent suicides at NIMHANS,"bangalore: nearly 1,800 persons complete and 15,000 attempt suicide every year in bangalore. most of the suicides are among young people and only 20 per cent of the suicides occur in urban areas, 80 per cent of suicides being reported in the rural regions, according to a recent study by nimhans. a team of doctors from the department of epidemiology and psychiatry at nimhans have conducted a study on suicides during 1998-2000. the complete report of the study will be released on august 29, when nimhans is organising a one-day workshop on ""suicide prevention -- capacity building measures"". according to dr g. gururaj, department of epidemiology, nimhans, ""bangalore is witnessing a spurt in suicides. through a series of such workshops we wish to bring more awareness among the doctors, police, law professionals, social workers, ngos, patient self-help groups, teachers and people from industrial establishments."" the year 1999 witnessed over 1,10,000 suicides in the country, which medical experts say, could be well under-reported. the workshop is sponsored by the world health organisation through the union ministry of health and aims at addressing the relevant issues in the causation of suicides and measures to reduce the same in bangalore. with increasing urbanisation, industrialisation, migration of people from rural areas and consequent changes in health problems of the residents, there's a noticeable socio-demographic transition and change in lifestyle patterns. this has brought suicide as a major public health problem. doctors say, the significant socio-economic burden due to suicides is still not clearly understood. however, worldwide research in the last two decades has clearly demonstrated that suicides are predictable and preventable. ""in our city the prevention programmes are conspicuously absent and the ongoing programmes do not even touch a major segment of the population,"" say dr gururaj and dr mohan k. isaac. the series of workshops will examine the problem, causes, pattern and trend of suicides, the role of health sector and professionals in suicide prevention and specific activities for bangalore. it also aims at sensitising the planners and administrators to develop collaborative activities for preventing the scourge of suicide.
