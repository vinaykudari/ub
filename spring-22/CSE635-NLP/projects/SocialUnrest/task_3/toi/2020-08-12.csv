0,City lawyers complain of vanishing suits,"KOLKATA: Last November, lawyers across West Bengal had vehemently protested against increase in court fees.

They had argued that the enhanced fees would make it impossible for common people to approach courts for settling petty disputes.

Nine months after, the protests have died down, but their worst fears have come true. Lawyers in the city civil and sessions court complain that the number of clients has dwindled considerably.

According to figures available with the court, the number of title suits filed till August 12, 2003, stood at 1,195. In 2002, about 9,000 suits were filed.

""Established lawyers are not exactly feeling the pinch, but new entrants have to face the brunt of increase in court fees,"" advocate Uttam De he pointed out.

In mofussil and sub-divisional courts, the drop in the number of cases was more pronounced, asserted lawyers. ""Those lawyers with a sense of social responsibility are even advising their less affluent clients to go in for out of court settlement,"" said senior lawyer Kashinath De.

Sraboni Ghoshal complained that her clients were down by 50 per cent. ""People are now approaching local politicians and goons to settle their property disputes. It has given rise to a new category of middlemen who take advantage of the gullibility of poor people to make a quick buck,"" she told TNN.

Assistant public prosecutor Naba Kumar Ghosh pointed out that people from the districts had been hard hit. ""I feel sorry for those who earn barely enough to eke out an existence, but have have to cough up more to get justice,"" he added.

Moon Moon Manna, a new entrant in the legal profession, confessed,""We couldn''t have joined the profession at a worse time. Clients are hard to come by and the competition is really stiff.""

Bar council members feared that the number of civil suits as well as criminal cases would go down further if the proposed preconciliation boards at block levels were set up. The emphasis on Lok Adalats would also have the same effect, they said.

2,Chapra college runs without principal,"CHAPRA: Teachers and non-teaching employees of local Rajendra College, a premier institution of J P University, feel sore as this college is running without any officially notified principal or professor incharge for the last few days.

Former professor incharge P N Sinha, who superannuated on July 31, had sent the name of the next senior most teacher, M K Sharan, to the university well in advance and handed over the charge of his office to him in anticipation of the university''s notification. But to date, no notification has been issued by the university causing a sense of insecurity among the staff, said Kameshwar Prasad Singh, a senior teacher of the college. The teachers have not been paid their salary for the last four months and if any contingency arises, there is no one to grant loans from the Provident Fund account of the staff, he stated.

Most of the staff feel that this is the first instance that the university is indecisive over this matter. Prior to this, the notification regarding appointment of the principal was received well in advance, they informed.

The tight lips of the university officials suggest that more than one claimant might be in the fray and the university must be waiting for any direction either from the chancellor or the Inter-university Board, they added. The salary of four months has been released and is expected in the colleges soon and if the present situation is allowed to continue, the staff would starve as there would be none to disburse the salary, saidcollege staff.

3,BNMU teachers assail state govt,"SAHARSA: The teachers of BN Mandal University, specially the senior ones, are sore over what they call the double yardstick of Bihar government even in compliance of the court orders. When it comes to payment of salary to the teachers and non-teaching staff of colleges and universities, the government allegedly picks up one order of the high court or the Supreme Court for execution whereas some other orders of the same court and of similar nature are deliberately ignored.

While releasing the salary grants to various universities, the state government has opted to maintain status quo in case of the new constituent colleges but has preferred complete silence on new UGC pay scale to the teachers promoted under time-bound scheme.

Higher education secretary B B Srivastava, in his letter dated July 18, 2003, has pleaded that the teachers and non-teaching employees of new constituent colleges would be paid salary according to the status quo ordered by the Patna High Court on January 31, 1997, since this order, according to Srivastava, has neither been quashed nor suspended by the Supreme Court while hearing the SLP No. 6098\97 in which inquiry was being conducted by Justice S C Agrawal. It is reliably learnt that the teachers and non-teaching staff of these colleges are likely to be paid salary with 271 per cent of DA although the teachers claim that the apex court had categorically ordered to provide all facilities till the final disposal of the case.

President of BNMU Teachers'' Association Manoranjan Jha, who is also a member of the university syndicate, expressed surprise over the alleged one-sided direction of the higher education secretary and said if status quo is maintained to deprive the teachers and non-teaching staff of new constituent colleges, the same should be applied in the case of senior teachers of old colleges and universities who have been denied time-bound promotion despite a clear-cut order of Patna High Court.

Although the division bench has not stayed the previous order while hearing the LPA filed by the state government, the same has not been implemented. ""It seems, the government has different yardsticks for different court orders, Jha said and added that it is clear-cut defiance of the court order.

4,J&K govt to revise industrial policy,"SRINAGAR: In a bid to revitalise the industrial sector, the Jammu and Kashmir government has decided to reframe the state industrial incentive policy.

The decision was taken at a high-level meeting, presided over by J&K deputy chief minister Mangat Ram Sharma and attended by principal secretary, industries and commerce, Sahsaraman, and head of departments of various industrial corporations.

Sharma said suitable modifications will be made to the present policy to make it more entrepreneur-friendly. The huge losses suffered by the industries in the last 12 years had made investors wary of doing business in the state, he said.

Sharma said a vibrant industrial sector held the key to restoration of peace and order to Jammu and Kashmir.

The deputy CM asked the principal secretary, industries, to review the incentive policy and identify the problem areas. Sharma indicated that the power tariff will be revised so as to ensure that entrepreneurs were not over-burdened.

Stressing on the need for revitalising the mining sector, Sharma said geological surveys would be carried out in the state.

5,"BJP, BSP take to farms in UP","LUCKNOW: Coalition partners Bahujan Samaj Party and the Bharatiya Janata Party are polishing their agriculture marketing skills to widen their support base among the farmers in western Uttar Pradesh.

And their USP is based on contract farming. Borrowed from Punjab, Haryana and Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh is now catching up with this concept. This year, the area earmarked for contract farming is around 4.5 lakh hectares for cultivation of ''Pusha-1'' variety of Basmati. Two lakh hectares have been slotted for wheat.

According to sources, the government has already roped in some corporate houses, including multinationals, for this purpose. In fact, several agreements have been finalised with farmers.

State agriculture minister and BJP leader Hukum Singh says, ''''Necessary inputs such as seeds, fertilisers and technical know-how will be provided to farmers for this purpose through a contract.''''

While Western Uttar Pradesh â€” stretching from Saharanpur to Meerut â€” is ideal for Basmati cultivation, part of Central UP â€” spread over Shahjehanpur, Unnao, Kanpur, Auraiya and Etawah â€” is suitable for wheat cultivation.

Incidentally, these areas are associated with different lobbies of farmers being assiduously cultivated by different political parties. It is said thatMulayam Singh Yadav of Samajwadi Party is to Central UP what Ajit Singh of Rashtriya Lok Dal is to Western UP.

So, with this scheme, the BJP hopes to get its pound of flesh, admits Hukum Singh. But then ''''contract farming is an answer to the failed cooperative system in UP''''. The twin objective of the scheme is to boost agriculture export and improve the farmers'' welfare by providing them assured marketing support, adds Hukum Singh.

To begin with, the minister says, only paddy and wheat had been selected for contract farming. Gradually its scope would be widened by bringing sugarcane and horticulture also in its ambit.

A roadmap, he says, is being prepared and the government would act on it only on the basis of the success rate in the first phase.

Under the scheme, farmers will sell their produce to contractors. The purchase centre set up by them will be deemed as mandis. And the condition of buying farmers'' produce from regular mandis would be done away with.

6,SC for law to enforce fundamental duties,"NEW DELHI: On the eve of the 56th year of India''s independence, the Supreme Court has asked the Centre to incorporate a chapter upholding dignity of the individual and personality development in the educational curriculum.

The government should not hesitate to enact appropriate legislation in order to enforce the constitutional mandate that every citizen must adhere to fundamental duties, the court said while disposing of an unprecedented public interest petition initiated by a former Supreme Court chief justice and MP Ranganath Misra.

Former attorney general K Parasaran, who assisted the court in dealing with Misra''s petition, told the court that the high-power Constitution review commission had already suggested implementation of a report of former Supreme Court chief justice J S Verma on ''operationalisation of fundamental duties''.

The CRC has said that the Verma committee''s recommendations must be implemented.

A Bench of Chief Justice V N Khare and Justices K G Balakrishnan and S B Sinha said ""at present we need not go into the other questions raised in Misra''s petition"".

Justice Misra had also asked the court to review a judgement, which had said that members of a particular community were not under any constitutional or legal obligation to stand up to show respect to the national flag at its hosting or while the national anthem was being sung.

Justice Misra had said that singing of the national anthem and showing respect to the national flag by standing when it was unfurled as a part of fundamental duty, which the citizens must be asked to adhere to.

The Verma commission''s recommendations, which have been upheld by the apex court said, ""It may be necessary to enact suitable legislation wherever necessary to require obedience of obligations by the citizens"".

It further said, ""If the existing laws are inadequate to enforce the needed discipline, the legislative vacuum needs to be filled. The desired enforceability can be better achieved by providing not merely for legal sanctions but also combining it with social sanctions and to facilitate the performance of the task through exemplar role models.""

The CRC has urged the Parliament to work for sensitising the people and to create general awareness of the provisions of fundamental duties. The citizens must be made aware that they have to show respect to every one''s religion and freedoms enjoyed by different religious groups and communities.

It has been stressed that the school education could play a vital role in this respect and education must not remain under the governmental or political control.

7,Indian wins $16 million lawsuit over Toyota,"BALTIMORE: Toyota Motor Corporation has lost its effort to overturn a $16 million judgment that was won by a Bowie man who lost his legs in a car accident because his seat was fully reclined.

Toyota failed to convince Judge James P Salmon of the Court of Special Appeals that it wasn''t responsible for Prashant Kumar''s June 1997 injuries.

Paul D Bekman, a lawyer for Kumar, said on Monday the case was a big win for the consumer.

""This is the little guy bringing a claim against a mega-corporation and saying, ''You can make these products safer,''"" he said.

At the May 2000 trial, Kumar''s lawyers argued that the company was partially responsible for the injury because, other than a note in the owner''s manual, there was no warning that reclining the seat would affect the seat belt''s restraining ability.

Kumar was a passenger who was sleeping when the Toyota Tercel was hit head-on by a Cadillac Cimarron that had crossed the centre line on a New Jersey highway.

Kumar was flung forward by the impact, shattering both legs which were later amputated above the knees. The driver of the Toyota was not seriously injured.

The court upheld that it was unreasonable to have expected Kumar to read the owner''s manual before riding as a passenger in the car and suggested putting a warning on the seat.

Bekman said just noting a safety precaution in the owner''s manual isn''t thorough enough.

""First of all, the owner doesn''t read it; second of all, the passenger doesn''t read it,"" he said.

The court also upheld Dr Joseph Burton''s testimony, who supported Kumar''s claim that the seat''s angle caused the seat belt to be ineffective. Burton testified that if Kumar were sitting upright, he would not have sustained such serious leg injuries.

Toyota spokesman Xavier Dominicis said on Tuesday the company is disappointed with the ruling, especially the warnings decision.

""If all the warnings were placed inside the vehicle, frankly we''d overwhelm the occupants,"" Dominicis said. ""We stand behind safe and practical warnings in the owner''s manual.""

He said Toyota is responsible for paying 30 per cent of the court''s reward and had not decided if it will take the case to a higher court.

A Baltimore jury had originally awarded Kumar $59.7 million, but the following December, the trial judge reduced the amount to $16 million. Some New Jersey laws were applied in the case.

8,India wants info on Patriot missile system,"NEW DELHI: India is looking at several anti-missile systems to boost its air defence capabilities to protect its airspace. Towards this end, India has asked the United States for ""technical information"" on its Patriot anti-missile system.

""A request has been sent to the Defence Cooperation Agency of the US government. The proposal is at a preliminary stage and a decision will be taken on receipt of evaluation of the technical information,"" said defence minister George Fernandes in Rajya Sabha on Wednesday.

India is also talking to Israel on the joint US-Israeli Arrow missile shield system but Fernandes sought to downplay this saying there was no proposal to ""acquire and upgrade"" the system.

Incidentally, Russia has also renewed its offer to provide an integrated air and missile defence system to India in the form of the long-range S-300V surface-to-air missile system, along with the shorter-range Tor-M1 and Buk-M1 systems, to provide theatre-wide air defence capabilities.

India has already acquired the Israeli Green Pine radar system which can detect incoming missiles from around 500 km away.

New Delhi and Washington have also decided to hold a missile defence workshop in India in the next six months.

9,SC/ST students protest curtailing of reserved seats,"KOLKATA: Parents of scheduled caste and scheduled tribe candidates for the MBBS course held a demonstration at the Calcutta Medical College on Wednesday in protest against the plan of the West Bengal government to allot seats reserved for SCs and STs to students ready to pay capitation fee.

ST candidate Sujaya Murmu and her brother Biplab planned to move court against forcing her to take admission in R.G.Kar medical college while seven seats for reserved for ST candidates remained vacant in the prestigious Calcutta Medical College.

Her dreams of studying in the oldest and the best medical college in the state was shattered, even after securing the third rank among the ST candidates. Only one ST candidate had been given admission in CMC.

Similarly, Mridul Saha was forced to take admission in Burdawan Medical College despite having secured the second rank in the category of physically challenged candidates, despite CMC having three seats in the category. Also, the admission fee had been increased from Rs 299 to Rs 4,500 without any prior notice, claimed students.

Director of medical education Chittaranjan Maity claimed that he was not able to guarantee admission to these students in any particular college. â€œI cannot assure admission to any of these students in any particular college. They will have to accept what they are offered,â€� he said.

Apprehending the problem, the Medical Council of India in a report on June 27 had warned the state government that in case the application for starting 150 additional MBBS seats was not approved by the MCI, the state government would have to take the responsibility of the extra number of students who would be given admissions in view of the introduction of the pay seats.

To accommodate the extra students in the existing medical colleges, too, the permission of the Centre would be required for increasing the number of seats. But officials said the state government had planned to avoid the hassle of seeking the permission by reducing seats in general and reserved categories and making them available for pay seat students.

Out of 1,050 medical and dental seats, student upto 611 rank in general category were admitted. The government order specified that 70 seats will be kept aside, seven from each medical college. Till now, 15 SC seats, 36 ST seats, 24 seats for physically challenged have been curtailed along with about 60 more in the general category.

10,Ramashish Rai slams BJP's anti-people policy,"LUCKNOW: Expelled former BJP MLC Ramashish Rai on Wednesday stated his newly floated Rashtrawadi Lok Morcha was not averse to joining hands with any political party or front which aimed at saving democracy.

He simultaneously slammed the BJP for pursuing anti-people and anti-farmer policies.

Addressing a press conference shortly after a meeting of the morcha members Rai said many former and present BJP MLAs had extended support to him in his fight against the wrong policies of the saffron party.

He claimed that representatives of 44 districts who owed allegiance to the BJP had attended the morcha meet as also former and present district presidents of the BJPs youth wing.

Included in them were those of Azamgarh, Deoria, Srinagar, Mau, Ballia and Allahabad. Rai also lauded BJP MLA Ram Iqbal for taking on Chief Minister Mayawati on the Dalit land issue in Ballia. Iqbal has been issued a show cause notice by the BJP.

Maintaining that his outfit was not a political party but merely a movement against forces which were out to crush the democratic process Rai said the BJP excelled in speaking with a forked tongue and there was a world of difference between what the party said and what it did.

Naming BJP Legislature Party leader Lalji Tandon and state President Vinay Katiyar, he said the duo along with a few others were working towards the detriment of BJP, though on the face of it they gave the impression that they were working for its uplift.

The morcha, Rai said would work towards ending the atrocities, corruption and lawlessness unleashed by the present government. With this end in view it would launch a signature campaign in 100 villages of each Assembly constituency.

The campaign would begin on August 21 from Deoria and on completion a memorandum with the signatures appended to it would be sent to the President.

Dwelling on the minutes of the meeting Rai said it had been decided to appoint a convenor of the morcha in each district and also nominate a convenor for each of the 403 Vidhan Sabha constituencies and the 80 Lok Sabha constituencies.

A political resolution was also passed on the occasion.

11,SGCCI for speeding up of developmental projects,"SURAT: Concerned over the lackadaisical attitude of the state government towards developing projects like a full-fledged airport and a seaport in Surat, and a network of roads connecting satellite towns like Navsari and Bardoli, officials of the Southern Gujarat Chamber of Commerce & Industry have urged local MLAs and others concerned to take up the issues for the all-round growth of the region.

SGCCI president Ashok Shah said that a white paper on longpending projects would be prepared soon to apprise the concerned ministries and officials of the state government. A meeting was convened by SGCCI, industry representatives and MLAs of South Gujarat last week to discuss these issues.

Speaking about the airport, Shah told the gathering that all efforts should be made for upgrading Magdalla airport for catering to bigger aircraft like Boeing 747s and Airbus 320s.

He said that though South Gujarat boasts of a long coastline, it lacks a standard seaport to handle cargo not only from Hazira-based industries but also from neighbouring land-locked states like MP.

The economy of the region would get a boost by developing a full-fledged seaport at Hazira. MLA Dhirubhai Gajera said that due to the congestion at Mumbai airport, the one at Magdalla should be fully developed and have night-landing facility.

He also said that the entire coastline in South Gujarat could be developed into a sea highway. Congress MLA Tushar Chaudhary said that power generation at the Kakarapar Atomic Power Station Vyara should be increased for meeting the requirements of sugar industries in the region.

Shah said that four-lane roads connecting Ankleshar-Surat, Dumas-Surat, Bardoli-Surat and Navsari-Surat needs to be constructed to boost trade and commerce in the region.

He also urged the MLAs present to impress upon the concerned ministries to expedite projects to develop the gems and jewellery park, the garment park and to set up an agro-processing zone.

Those present in the meeting included BJP MLAs Dhansukh Patel and Bhavna Chapatwala, Congress MLA Manish Gilitwala and city BJP unit president Kishore Wankawala, among others.

12,State relaxes labour laws for IT industry,"CHANDIGARH: Conceding a long standing demand of the information technology (IT) and IT-enabled industry, Punjab governor and UT administrator on Wednesday announced relaxation in labour laws for them in the city.

Giving away the state software export awards for the year 2002-2003 to IDS Infotech, E3R and Excel Callnet Limited at a function at CII here, he said women employees will now be allowed to work round the clock in maximum of eight-hour shifts on the condition they are provided secure means of transport for doing night duty.

Earlier the women employees were barred from working between 8 pm and 6 am because of which the operations of the IT-enabled companies, especially the call centres, which employ a high percentage of women staff, were suffering.

Most states, including Punjab and Haryana, had already made these relaxations in their labour laws and Chandigarh was seen to be lagging behind on this front.

In his address, Verma hoped that the relaxation in the labour laws will provide further boost to the administration''s efforts to attract investment in technology sector.

Besides a galaxy of entrepreneurs, including former presidents of the Chandigarh committee of the CII Yashovardhan Saboo and I S Paul, among others present were UT finance-cum-IT secretary Karan A Singh, Software Technology Parks of India Additional Director Sanjay Tyagi and UT IT Director Vivek Atray.

13,PeopleSoft adds fresh facts to Oracle lawsuit,"PALO ALTO (CALIFORNIA): PeopleSoft Inc said on Tuesday it expanded its lawsuit against Oracle Corp, alleging it had new facts about Oracleâ€™s ongoing efforts to disrupt PeopleSoftâ€™s business as Oracle pursues its $7.3 billion hostile takeover bid for PeopleSoft.

PeopleSoft said it amended its original lawsuit, filed in Alameda County Superior Court in June, adding â€˜â€˜extensive new factsâ€™â€™ to back what it called Oracleâ€™s ongoing unfair trade practices, including efforts to disrupt relationships with PeopleSoft customers and users of software from JD Edwards & Co which PeopleSoft recently acquired.

PeopleSoft, based in Pleasanton, California, also said it added new information regarding its allegation that Oracle had undertaken a campaign to deliberately mislead PeopleSoft customers about Oracleâ€™s plans to support PeopleSoft products.

PeopleSoft also said it consolidated its lawsuit with the one filed against Oracle by JD Edwards, and as a result would voluntarily dismiss JD Edwardsâ€™ claims.

Portions of the amended complaint have been filed with the court under seal. PeopleSoft continues to seek injunctive relief and damages, including damage caused to JD Edwards.

PeopleSoft has rejected Oracleâ€™s bid, which is currently undergoing an antitrust review by the Department of Justice. â€˜â€˜It would be inappropriate for us to comment without having seen the filing,â€™â€™ said Oracle spokesman Jim Finn, who added that Oracle had expected PeopleSoft to file an amended complaint.

â€˜â€˜It does not change our commitment to acquire PeopleSoft,â€™â€™ Finn said. On Tuesday, Oracle shares closed up 48 cents, or 4 per cent, at $12.16 on the Nasdaq, while PeopleSoftâ€™s stock gained 39 cents, or 2 per cent, to finish at $16.98.
