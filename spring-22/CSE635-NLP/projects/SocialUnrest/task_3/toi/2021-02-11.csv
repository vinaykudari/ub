3,Volvo positions Renault trucks for Indian Army,"NEW DELHI: Swedish heavy vehicle maker Volvo is planning to introduce application-mounted trucks and armoured vehicles under the Renault badge in India. The firm is currently testing ground with the Indian armed forces, regarding the acceptance of Renault''s range of military vehicles. Volvo has acquired Renault''s truck division.

However, there are no plans to introduce Renault trucks in the civilian market here. ""We will look at just a military positioning,"" a spokesman said. ""A decision on introduction of Renault vehicles in India will be based on market feedback and response from the armed forces.""

Meanwhile, the firm is preparing for a major thrust on the north Indian markets with its range of luxury buses. Volvo bus division general manager Akash Passey said: ""We have already made a mark in the west and south Indian markets with our buses.

4,State government fails to meet tax target,"MUMBAI: â€œMaharashtra Leading,â€™â€™ says the innovative punchline advertising the achievements chief minister Sushilkumar Shindeâ€™s government, but a reality check on the stateâ€™s income from April 2003 to December 2003 reveals that tax collection is way behind target.

The state finance ministry, which sets the targets for all departments and accordingly plans its expenditure, is in a tizzy, as revenue has dipped sharply even as the debt burden exceeds Rs 94,000 crore.

Records obtained from the concerned revenue-earning departments indicate that the finance ministryâ€™s expectations are falling short by over Rs 1,200 crore.

Total tax collection in the last nine months has been Rs 17,318 crore, short of the given target of 18,550 crore. â€œThe Democratic Front government, however, is not willing to accept this economic truth and is on spending spree, doling out crore rupees for populist measures,â€™â€™ official said.

Take the case of sales tax,which is the key revenue-earning arm of the stateâ€”total earnings in the last nine months were Rs 1,432 crore, short of the target of Rs 1,522 crore. Income from state excise and transport, two other departments that contribute majorly to the state treasury, has also been dismal and not met the targets.

According to reports from these two departments, the state excise collection was recorded at Rs 1,611 crore till December â€˜03, but the target was Rs 1,687 crore, indicating a shortfall of over Rs 70 crore. â€œThe transport department managed to collect Rs 747 crore against a target of Rs 855 crore.

The difference is above Rs 100 crore and it is surprising given the fact that the number of vehicles on roads is increasing and the state has now decided on a one-time vehicle tax,â€™â€™ said a transport department official.

The only glimmer of hope for the cash-starved Maharashtra government is the stamps and registration department, which not only hit the target but registered an income growth of Rs 154 crore over the past nine months.

â€œIt is basically the streamlining of systems by Dr Nitin Karir, who heads this department, that has led to the rise in revenue. Till December 2003, the stamps and registration department collected Rs 2,354 crore against a target of Rs 2,199 crore. It is an achievement that none of the other departments have managed to do,â€™â€™ an official said.

Another sales tax official pointed to a grim scenario in taxes collected from sugar barons in the state. â€œIn the last nine months, the sugar purchase tax collection was a mere Rs 2.76 crore against a target of Rs 111 crore. It is like giving a tax holiday to the sugar daddies. Cane farmers and cooperatives are already heavily subsidised, now they are even reluctant to pay tax to the state government,â€™â€™ he said.

5,Bhatt plans film on scam prince,"MUMBAI: Noted director Mahesh Bhatt has decided to produce a film on the life of Abdul Karim Telgi, prime accused in the multi-crore fake stamp paper scam.

â€œI was inspired to make a film when I read the report in The Times of India on Wednesday mor n i n g about Telgi squandering as much as Rs 93 lakh on dancer in bar,â€™â€™ Mr Bhatt told TNN on Wednesday.

Irfan Khan, who has become a celebrity overnight following the rave reviews he received for his acting in Maqbool, has agreed to play the lead role in the as yet untitled film.

Mr Bhatt had a meeting with his investors on Wednesday and they have approved the project. In all probability, the movie will be directed by his daughter Pooja, who recently made her directorial debut with Paap. The film on Telgi is likely to be released at the time of the Lok Sabha elections.

â€œTelgi has neatly exposed the claim that India is shining. In fact, by systematically subverting the system to feed his greed for money, he has shown the depth of the rot in our country and effectively proved that India is collapsing and not shining,â€™â€™ Mr Bhatt said.

â€œA man who started life as a street vendor has shrewdly exploited the venality of our police and politicians across several states to amass a fortune. He took out the entire printing machinery from a socalled high security government press.

""He thought nothing of throwing Rs 93 lakh at a dancer in one night and ripped open a system where money is everything. He has made nonsense of the moral posturings of the people who man the establishment in India,â€™â€™ he added.

â€œI am producing the film since news stories tend to fade from peopleâ€™s memories. I want to use the medium of entertainment to tell people that the Telgi affair is a wakeup call for the entire nation.â€™â€™

7,"Mid-term elections are likely, says Kalyan","LUCKNOW: Newly appointed chairman of the 14-member BJP poll management committee Kalyan Singh on Wednesday caused a flutter by announcing that mid-term assembly polls could be held in Uttar Pradesh along with the Lok Sabha polls.

""Political situation in Uttar Pradesh is changing fast. People are fed up with the misrule of the present government which may fall sooner than expected,"" declared Kalyan during the joint working committee and state council meeting at Ravindralaya on Wednesday.

Launching an attack on the rainbow coalition, Kalyan said that it had failed on all fronts. ""The crime graph is spiralling on each passing day. The government has done nothing to redress grievances of farmers. There is total anarchy in the state,"" said Kalyan, who was part of the coalition till last month.

Changing track after his home-coming, it was for the first time that Kalyan came out in the open against the Mulayam-led coalition government keeping in mind that his party''s main fight would be against the Samajwadi Party followed by the BSP and the Congress.

BJP general secretary Pramod Mahajan, too, made it clear that the Samajwadi Party and the BSP were their the main opponents in the state as the Congress was nowhere in the contest in Uttar Pradesh. ""The Congress is no challenge to the BJP in Uttar Pradesh. The Samajwadi Party and the BSP are the main opponents,"" he said.

Thus, the advice was to mount attack on the Mulayam government and use the anti-incumbency factor in favour of the Lotus. Accordingly, highlights of Katiyar''s inaugural and Kalyan''s speeches were misrule of the Mulayam government besides rendering of â€˜Atal mantra''.

A word of caution came from Union minister Sangh Priya Gautam. ""The party state leadership should put up a united front to achieve the target,"" advised Gautam causing a flutter by openly taking names of leaders who were responsible for the party''s debacle in 1999.

Taking cue from the party high command, the BJP state unit on Wednesday passed on the â€˜Atal mantra'' to party leaders and workers for sailing through the Lok Sabha polls.

â€˜Atal, Atal and Atal'', speeches of party state president Vinay Katiyar, Kalyan Singh as well as Union agriculture minister Rajnath Singh, state incharge Kalraj Mishra and other party leaders during the joint working committee and state council meeting on Wednesday revolved in glorifying Vajpayee and achievements of his government.

Directions were issued accordingly to party workers. The message was to keep fluid political situation in the state also in mind while launching campaign for the Lok Sabha polls.

The party has chalked out a two-pronged strategy: step up attack on the Mulayam-led coalition and take the â€˜Atal sandesh'' to people to counter whatever little effect the Nehru-Gandhi family has on masses in the state.

To achieve the target, the party has organised a series of seven more rallies in February and planned to take out Atal Sandesh yatras and meetings in all 80 Lok Sabha constituencies by March.

8,Cops use horsepower to check clashes,"AHMEDABAD: Itâ€™s horse-trading, but of a different kind. The phenomenon, while involving negotiation accompanied by mutual concessions and shrewd bargaining, has more to do with policing than politics.

The Ahmedabad rural police are now renting out horses to farmers to protect their fields from intruding cattle. While the police make money from this arrangement, they are not looking for financial gain. The horses prevent bloody fights from breaking out between groups when cattle stray onto fields and are thus helping the police to keep the peace.

In fact, the horses have become so popular that even local MLAs are rushing to hire horses to help keep their electorate peaceful and happy. Villagers are flooding the police authorities with requests. The lucky few have no qualms in paying up Rs 1,500 per month for a pair of horses with two police jawans. Cops say horses do the job of keeping cattle at bay better when operating in pairs.

The Ahmedabad rural police have already rented out 30 horses this year and other districts are also following suit.

Police say the horses-on-rent scheme has prevented clashes like the one in August last year in Dangad village when a Bharwad (cattle owner) was shot at by a landlord after cattle strayed into his field. ""A government resolution allowing rural police to rent out horses was passed about a decade ago. With this, farmers can secure their farmlands, and clashes between land owners and cattle rearers have come down,"" says Manoj Agarwal, superintendent of police, Ahmedabad.

In the rural areas around Ahmedabad, about 75 to 80 cases used to be registered in each of the two crop seasons in a year â€” from January to March and July to September. This figure has dropped to just 25 in the season gone by. Police sources say this drop in grazing-related violence came after the Ahmedabad police increased the number of horses being rented out from 12 to 30. Looking to the success of the experiment in Ahmedabad, police in Kheda and Junagadh districts too, have started deploying horses.

Even local MLAs are using political clout to use horses in their respective areas. So high is the demand that the Kheda police recently recalled six horses it lent out to Ahmedabad after being ""pressurised"" by a local MLA. ""The horses have ensured peace in rural areas where it does not take time for trouble to flare up,"" says PSI of Viramgam police station, Ajay Rajput.

""We need at least 50 horses in Ahmedabad to meet the demand, there is still a shortfall of around 20 horses,"" says Agarwal. Junagadh SP RJ Sawani had to ask for the two horses the force lent to Ahmedabad. ""There are 16 horses here in Junagadh but we need more,"" says Sawani.

9,NDA wary of Pak tour ahead of polls,"NEW DELHI: The ruling BJP-led NDA is said to be concerned that a defeat for Sourav and his boys in Pakistan may be jarring in a season when it expects to romp home in the Lok Sabha polls on the strength of the feel-good pitch.

Taking on Pakistan on their home turf has not been an easy task even in ordinary circumstances. But the risk of a team saddled with security concerns not measuring up to its potential is real and this is acknowledged by a Board official.

The mauling that Ganguly & Co took against Australia in the One-day series has also contributed to the lack of enthusiasm about the team''s prospects in Pakistan.

A Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) official revealed that Andhra Pradesh chief minister and NDA partner N Chandrababu Naidu also wanted the Board to put the matter into the pause mode until after the elections.

BJP leaders who would like the tour to be put off also argue that the postponement of the tour by a couple of months will not interfere with the process of normalisation of bilateral ties â€” a point that the external affairs ministry does not dispute.

10,Sikh children hold rally in favour of wearing turban,"AMRITSAR: Sikh children wearing turbans and holding placards in support of right to wear turbans by French Sikhs held a demonstration near Golden Temple on Thursday.

The demonstration was organized by Culture and Heritage Conservation Initiative (CHCI) and Sikh Nations Organization (SNO).

The demonstration coincides with the reported visit of French foreign minister Dominique de Villepin in India. Sikh children including from Miri Piri academy raised slogans in favour of wearing turban.

Children issued global appeal to the Sikh nation to unitedly rise to the occasion to preserve its heritage, ideology and identity and also appealed them to wear golden yellow head gear on Gurpurabs and every Thursdays as part of global campaign to make the world community understand that unshorn hair and head gear was an integral part of the Sikh body and soul and was as per the directives of Sikh gurus.

Manjit Singh Randhawa, convenor of CICI and president of SNO alleged that the proposed law by French government was arbitrary and unjust. He said it violates the internationally accepted principles of human right to personal freedom.

Giving logic behind supporting golden yellow turban on a particular day, Randhawa said that would help Sikhs to effectively project their unique identity and ideology of Sikhism to treat all humans as equal and selfless.

11,SGPC to meet French minister on turban issue,"AMRITSAR: Honorary secretary of Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) has cautioned the Sikh sangat to be aware of the people who were making baseless statements about the role of SGPC with respect to defending the right of wearing turban by Sikhs in France.

In a press release issued here on Thursday Calcutta, without naming anyone, said these people were trying to create divide and confusion among Sikhs.

Notably Chain Singh, president Sri Guru Singh Sabha, Paris who is spearheading the agitation in France, upon his arrival in India had stated that SGPC was not coordinating with them in their movement for defending their right of wearing turbans. However he had hailed the role of SAD(Amritsar) president Simranjit Singh Maan in extending support to them. Chain Singh had also stated that he would meet Calcutta and other Sikh leaders.

Calcutta said those who were raising unnecessary if''s and but''s on the role of SGPC should reveal their efforts and its results in public.

Calcutta said that general secretary of SAD and Union minister for Chemical and fertilizers Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa, general secretary SGPC Sukhdev Singh Bhaur and additional secretary Dalmegh Singh would meet the visitng French minister in Delhi on Friday and submit a memorandum with him about concern of Sikhs against the French government''s decision of imposing a ban on wearing turbans. He said SGPC had urged the government to take up the issue with French government through diplomatic channels.
