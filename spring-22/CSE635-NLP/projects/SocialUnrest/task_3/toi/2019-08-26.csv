0,Builders to contribute trucks for BMC cleanliness drive,"MUMBAI: A buildersâ€™ association has decided to help the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation get its cleanliness drive rolling.

The Maharashtra Chamber of Housing Industry (MCHI) will provide 55 trucks to help the civic administration clear and transport garbage. The cleanliness campaign,which was launched on August 15, will continue for three months. â€œWe were falling short of vehicles,â€™â€™ municipal commissioner Karun Srivastava said. â€œThe procedure to hire trucks from private contractors takes a long time. So I appealed to the MCHI.â€™â€™

Last week, the civic standing committee rejected the administrationâ€™s Rs 67-crore proposal to hire trucks from contractors to transport garbage to the dumping grounds. Committee members said there were several irregularities in the tendering process. The MCHI, which has 300 members, also plans to adopt gardens, beaches, footpaths and streets as part of the cleanliness campaign. Three developers have agreed to beautify a four-km stretch of the Eastern Express highway, starting from the Mulund check naka. Several other builders have agreed to provide litter-bins and trolleys. They will also sponsor newspaper advertisements about the cleanliness drive, Mr Srivastava said.

A MCHI spokesperson said not all its members were contributing to the campaign. Only some prominent builders have committed themselves to the drive. For instance, Mayfair Housing is planning to beautify Azad Road in Andheri (west) and clean the approach road on both sides of Santacruz station. Raheja developers will beautify two bus stops at Kalina in Santacruz by installing seating planks with attached dustbins. Keystone Realtors will beautify five bus stops at Madh, in Malad. It will also adopt parts of Prabhadevi and pave the footpath opposite Siddhivinayak temple with chequered tiles.

The Hiranandani construction company will beautify the Ghatkopar-Vikhroli area. On the Mahakavi Bhushan Marg, starting from Regal Cinema junction to the Gateway of India, the Clean Mumbai Foundation, a non-governmental organisation, has taken responsibility to ensure that garbage is not dumped in the community bins during the day. Kunti Oza of the foundation said, â€œShop and hotel owners throw garbage round the clock. As a result, the community bins overflow.

Now they throw garbage only at night and the conservancy staff clears the garbage in the morning.â€™â€™ But what do traders do with their garbage throughout the day? According to Ms Oza, â€œThey keep it with themselves. It is quite simple, like we keep our garbage in the dustbin the entire day and the sweeper collects it the next day.

The road which is frequented by tourists looks cleaner during the day.â€™â€™ To motivate the BMC conservancy staff in its work, Ms Oza, her colleagues and girl students from city schools tied rakhis on the hands of sweepers for â€˜protecting us against dirtâ€™ on Friday.

1,Gujarat election hearings may be marathon,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court may have to go through marathon hearings before forming its opinion on the the brief three-point Presidential reference, a fallout of the Election Commission's refusal to hold elections in trouble-torn Gujarat by October. Going by the EC's perception of the ''muddy'' situation in Gujarat, polls could be considered sometime in November. But the Modi government wanted early polls, preferably before October when the six month-deadline expires.Some of the issues which are likely to come under the SC's scrutiny are: The EC's constitutional role to hold ''free and fair'' elections, the governor's power to recommend President's Rule and the correct understanding of Article 174 (1)(2) of the Constitution . In fact it is because of this provision, which is presumably meant for an existing House and not for a dissolved assembly, that the issue has become significant. Article 174 (1) says: ''The governor shall from time to time summon the House or each House of the state's legislature ..., but six months shall not intervene between its last sitting in one session and the date appointed for its first sitting in the next session. An important rationale behind Article 174 is to ensure that the government is not run by Ordinances. The government cannot promulgate an Ordinance when the assembly or House is in session. An Ordinance expires when the assembly is in session and it is incumbent upon the government to move a Bill, if need be, to legislate on the Ordinance. ''A parliamentary democracy cannot be allowed to run by Ordinances''. If that was done, the role of people's representative in governance would be reduced to zero.The apex court's Constitution Bench would consider whether the time frame provided under Article 174 is subject to EC's order under Article 324.Second, can the EC under Article 324 draft an election schedule if the timeframe provided under Article 174 is not complied with? Will the President step in under Article 356? Three, is the EC bound by the mandate of Article 174 and therefore bound to conduct elections within the timeframe drawing the forces as required from the Central government for conducting free and fair elections?Modi on July 19 recommended dissolution of the assembly thinking that by October 6, six months after the last assembly session in April, the state would have constituted its new assembly. But the EC felt that free and fair polls would not be possible under the prevailing situation in Gujarat. It said President's Rule could be imposed in the state in case a new assembly was not constituted by October 6. According to Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani: ''The Election Commission's job is to hold elections and not to stall the polls''. Now, the Supreme Court has to resolve the tangle.

2,Katiyar to partymen: Regain No 1 spot,"LUCKNOW: BJP state president Vinay Katiyar exhorted party workers to put up a united front to regain the number one spot in Uttar Pradesh as lack of coordination and infighting had only resulted in party slipping to number three in the state. Inaugurating a five-district training camp in Firozabad, Katiyar pointed out that neglect of party workers could never enable the party to win elections. Development works alone could not make party win. Party should also think about the 'development' of party workers too. Katiyar claimed that neglect of the party workers in the past had led to the party's downfall in the state. Despite being in the government we could not drive home its advantages. Instead of taking the policies and programmes to the people, we indulged in mud-slinging and change of leadership. This created a wide gulf between the government and the organisation resulting in party suffering a jolt in the assembly polls, he said taking a dig at the previous government led by Rajnath Singh. Whenever there is lack of coordination and communication, the party's graph nosedives and bickerings come to the fore. We must introduce a system in which there is no place for such things. This can be achieved only through training, said. Laying emphasis on organising such training camps all over the state at all levels, the BJP state president said that it was necessary to activate cadre round the year and update party workers in the changing political scenario. The party has decided to organise such training camps at the district and then commissionerate levels to train party workers. During the camps the party workers will be exhorted to take the party programmes to the grass-root level and rope in the support of Dalits and backwards. The party has also set up Pt Deen Dayal Updhyaya Antyodhya Cell which will make and implement programmes for the welfare and uplift of Dalits and backwards in order to bring them into the party fold. The party has also lauded the step of the coalition government to double the budgetary allocation for the uplift of poor and Dalits. The party president said that the coalition government, headed by Mayawati, was committed to remove all disparities in the social.

3,Lack of coordination hits govt probes,"HYDERABAD: Many missing cases, including those of children, youngsters and senior citizens, go undetected due to lack of proper coordination in the police department.

From 1999 to July 2002, of the 1,905 cases of missing children below 15 years reported in the city, 425 remain undetected.

Of the 3,257 cases of missing persons above 15 years, 821 are undetected, according to deputy commissioner of police in detective department Satyanarayana Reddy.

Though missing cases could lead to serious offences or even murder cases, no proper feedback exists at the state level, according to police sources.

The feedback exists for property offences, while for missing cases efforts are made at the district level but there is no state-level coordination.

An individual reported missing from one district could be traced in another district but it needs for a proper state-level coordination in the department, the officer said. Often, when the complainants themselves find the missing person they do not report that to the police.

The case remains as undetected in the police records. It should be made mandatory for complainants to report back, he said.

With about 700 police stations in the state and 63 in the city, the task of detecting missing persons would be easier if there exists a coordination and feedback facility, the police officer said.

From 1997 to June 2002, the highest number of missing cases â€” 2,712 â€” have been reported from the west zone of Hyderabad covering Punjagutta and S R Nagar.

East zone with 1,442 missing cases follows this. South zone covering Old City areas with 1,405 cases comes next, according to the Central Crime Records Bureau in the city.

The highest number of missing cases reported are of children. This is due to child abuse at home, workplace or corporal punishment at educational institutions.

Reasons for youngsters missing are failure in examinations or elopement. Missing cases of elders are due to family tensions or being mentally challenged, the officials said. Naidu said.

4,"SC issues notices to EC, state govts","NEW DELHI: Hearing the Presidential reference on the controversial order of the Election Commission on Gujarat assembly poll, the Supreme Court on Monday issued notices to the Commission, all the state governments and the six recognised political parties.

A five-judge constitution bench comprising Chief Justice B N Kirpal, Justice V N Khare, Justice K G Balakrishnan, Justice Ashok Bhan and Justice Arijit Basayat fixed on Thursday for working out a time-table for hearing of the reference.

When Solicitor General Harish Salve, appearing for the Union government, said under Article 174 of the Constitution, the Gujarat Assembly has to be reconstituted by October two deadline, the bench said ""you don''t worry about that for the time being. We will work out a time schedule for hearing of the reference on Thursday.""

When certain regional political parties pleaded that they should also be given an opportunity to address the Court on the reference, the bench refused saying ""then it will be difficult to control the proceedings.""

The six national political parties to whom notices were issued on Monday were Congress, BJP, CPI(M), CPI, Nationalist Congress Party and BSP.

Except BSP, all other parties accepted the notices inside the court.

The Supreme Court Registry has already issued notices to the Attorney General Soli J Sorabjee and Solicitor General Harish Salve. The law ministry had specifically mentioned to the Registrar General that Salve would represent the Union Government in the reference matter.

The three questions on which President A P J Abdul Kalam sought the opinion of the Supreme Court were:

â€¢ Is Article 174 subject to the decision of the Election Commission of India under Article 324 as to the schedule of elections of the Assembly?

â€¢ Can the Election Commission of India frame a schedule for the elections to an Assembly on the premise that any infraction of the mandate of Article 174 would be remedied by a resort to Article 356 by the President?

â€¢ Is the Election Commission of India under a duty to carry out the mandate of Article 174 of the Constitution, by drawing upon all the requisite resources of the Union and the State to ensure free and fair election?.

5,Security alert in Nagaland following NSCN clashes,"KOHIMA: Security forces were on alert in Zunheboto district of Nagaland following factional fighting among Naga militant groups in the past couple of days, official sources said on Monday.

Patrolling was intensified in vulnerable pockets of the district to keep off a large number of activists from both the NSCN (I-M) and the NSCN (K), as part of the heightened security arrangements, the sources said.

Tension mounted in Zunheboto in the wake of the NSCN (I-M)''s recent decision to ''abrogate the peace zone arrangement'' in the district, levelling charges at its rival NSCN (K) on hunting down its cadres in connivance with the security forces.

The situation turned alarming when the NSCN (K) on Sunday announced imposition of an ''indefinite economic blockade'' in Zunheboto from August 28 to protest killings of its cadres by the rival group.

Four activists - three from NSCN (K) in the outskirts of Dimapur and one from NSCN (I-M) in Zunheboto - were killed in factional clashes since Friday, the sources said.

The state had witnessed comparative peace in recent times after the initiation of the peace process between the Centre and the Naga underground outfits.

6,Geete replaces Prabhu as power minister in Cabinet reshuffle,"NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee on Monday sprang a surprise by inducting Madhya Pradesh BJP leader Vikram Verma into the Cabinet while elevating Minister of State Anant Geete of Shiv Sena to Cabinet rank to take the place of Suresh Prabhu who resigned last week.

Verma, a Rajya Sabha member, was the leader of the Opposition in the state Assembly and was tipped as chief ministerial candidate in 1998 elections which he lost. He was later brought to the Rajya Sabha.

Another new entrant in Monday''s exercise, which was essentialy meant to be Shiv Sena-oriented, was Shiv Sena MP Anandrao V Adsul, a dalit, who has been made a minister of state to take Geete''s place.

President A P J Abdul Kalam administered the oath of office and secrecy to the new members in the Ashoka Hall of the Rashtrapati Bhavan. The brief ceremony was attended by Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani and their ministerial colleagues.

The minor expansion was necessitated following resignation of power minister and Shiv Sena leader Suresh Prabhu on the directive of his party supremo Bal Thackeray.

With these changes, the strength of the council of ministers has gone up to 78.

The representation of Madhya Pradesh in the Union Cabinet has risen to three with the induction of Verma -- two other Cabinet ministers being Uma Bharti and Satya Narain Jatiya.
