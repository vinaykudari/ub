1,Two special courts to try violence at Marad,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Kerala government on Wednesday decided to constitute two special courts to try the cases connected with incidents of violence at coastal hamlet of Marad in Kozhikode district on May 2 this year and in 2002, respectively.

Talking to reporters after a Cabinet meeting, Chief Minister A K Antony said the special courts--Additional Sessions Court and Chief First Class Magistrate court-- would speed up the trial of cases connected with the incidents. Both courts would function at Kozhikode.

Investigation into the May 2 violence was almost over and chargesheet would be filed soon. The violence had claimed nine lives while last year five persons were killed.

As the Kerala High Court and high courts of South Indian states had expressed their inability to spare the services of a sitting judge as Judicial Commission to probe the May 2 violence, the government had asked the High Court to provide the services of a senior sitting district judge for the purpose.

On the rehabilitation of minority families that fled the area after the violence, Antony said government was preparing details for rehabilitation. With the setting up of special courts and framing of chargesheet, it was expected that a peaceful atmosphere would emerge in the area, Antony added.

3,MLCs grill minister on fee hike,"PATNA: Cutting across party lines, MLCs grilled junior secondary education minister Ram Prakash Mahto over his dissatisfactory reply on the non-registration of many poor students of Bihar.

Kedar Pandey of CPI, during call attention motion of council, said that at least 10,000 poor students have been debarred from registration. The steep hike in registration fee has also prevented the poor and downtrodden sections of society.

Quoting the rules of the Bihar School Examination Board, Arun Kumar of Congress said that BSEB has to take prior approval from the state government for making any hike in the registration fee. He sought specific reply from the state government whether the department has given approval to the BSEB.

Mahto, amidst noisy scenes, said that there has not been any significant rise in the registration fee since 1994. He said that in 1994, it was Rs 40 and after 10 years, it had gone up to only Rs 100.

Pandey also cited glaring examples of the irregularities in the BSEB in the scrutiny of answersheets of matriculation examination.

He also said the BSEB has fixed Rs 500 for the scrutiny of answersheets which is very high.

The minister said the BSEB has maintained total transperancy by making various provisions in its scrutiny of answersheets.

4,Total bandh in Danapur to protest killing,"DANAPUR: While the Danapur police failed to make any breakthrough in the murder case of Dr Om Prakash Verma, the entire town on Wednesday observed total bandh for the second consecutive day at the call given jointly by the local citizens forum, Danapur Doctors'' Association and the businessmen of the town to protest the killing of Dr Verma.

Verma was shot dead by the armed criminals at his residence on Sunday night following his refusal to pay Rs 5 lakh as extortion money to the local goons.

The call for the total Danapur bandh was given in the late evening meeting held on Tuesday at the cantonment area in which doctors, lawyers, businessmen, youths and various social organisations participated.

The impact of bandh in the main market area was total. Most of the shops and business establishment spontaneously downed their shutters. None of the medical store shops, private clinics and nursing homes were open in the town as a part of their three-day strike. Traffic movement in the town was sparse since early morning hours. However, attendance in the government offices was normal.

Working in the Danapur civil court was badly affected for the second day on Wednesday due to the bandh call.The Danapur Bar Association on Tuesday went on a pen-down strike to condemn the doctor''s murder as well as to register protest on sudden escalation in crimes in the town.A delegation of the local people met Danapur SDO M Bari and handed over a memorandum to him which demanded immediate arrest of the criminals involved in the doctor''s murder and safety to life and property of the people.

It also urged senior police officials to transfer all the policemen from the Danapur police station who have already completed five years in the police station.

When contacted, Danapur SDO said that there was no untoward incident reported from anywhere in the town during the bandh. He claimed that traffic movement in the town was by and large normal.

Meanwhile, the panicked businessmen who had earlier received threat calls for having not paid rangdari tax to the local goons, shifted to a safer place from Danapur following the killing of Dr Verma, sources said, adding that many other medical practitioners were planning to shift from Danapur.

5,Walkout in House over minister's reply,"PATNA: Refusing to be cowed by the opposition criticism that the Bihar government has failed on all fronts, including law and order, parliamentary affairs minister Ram Chandra Purbey claimed in the assembly on Wednesday that the state is moving fast on the development track under the stewardship of Chief Minister Rabri Devi.

Purbey said Bihar was placed sixth in the country in the implementation of 20-point programme during 2002-03, which was no mean achievement considering the fact that it had been placed 15th during 2001-02.

Replying to a two-and-a-half-hour debate on the Rs 6.59-crore budgetary demand of the cabinet secretariat and co-ordination department for 2003-04, Purbey said the incidence of cognisable offence per one lakh population was only 123.4 in the state as against the national average of 176.4.

In the matter of complaints lodged against police, the national average was 5.3 per cent as against only 0.1 per cent in Bihar. It resulted in increased flow of tourists to the state during the last three years, he maintained.

Rejecting the cut motion moved by Navin Kishore Pra-sad Sinha (BJP), the House passed the budgetary demand by voice vote in the absence of BJP, Samata, CPI-ML and JD-U members who had staged a walkout expressing their dissatisfaction over the ministerâ€™s reply even as he was half-way through it.

Initiating the debate on the cut motion earlier, Nand Kishore Yadav (BJP) said Bihar has created a record of sorts in respect of bank dacoities, kidnapping and violation of human rights. Bihar has fallen far behind the national average in the matter of per capita income. The ministers have no control over their departmental secretaries, he added.

Narendra Singh (Lok Janshakti) demanded an inquiry into the issues raised by former Darbhanga commissioner Amita Paul in her letters to the personnel secretary.

He said Ajit Poddar, an assistant in the office of Darbhanga commissioner, is virtually running the commissionery even as he was placed under suspension by Paul. Purbey said that the matter would be probed and that appropriate action would be taken in the light of the inquiry report.

Ram Swarth Rai (RJD) said several important posts are lying vacant in the state. Purbey expressed his dissatisfaction over the credit-deposit ratio of banks in the state though he maintained that it had increased to 24.59 per cent in 2002-03 from 22.79 per cent in 2001-02.

He said 1,422 primary schools would be upgraded to middle schools. The government is to appoint 34,000 teachers, including 10,000 Urdu teachers, for schools of whom 50 per cent would be women, he added.

Intermediate Education Council: The printing of answer books for the Intermediate Education Council for the intermediate examinees at high cost rocked the state assembly. The Speaker, Sadanand Singh, said that he would himself look into the matter and if needed could constitute a House Committee to probe into the matter.

Oppn grills minister: The opposition members put the road construction minister, Mahabali Singh, in the dock for the failure of the government to construct even a temporary by-pass road to ease traffic pressure on the Vikramshila bridge on Ganga at Bhagalpur.

The minister was caught on the wrong foot when he said that his department was yet to get a no-objection certificates (NOCs) from rural and urban development departments.

The Speaker, however, informed him that both the departments had already given the NOC to the road construction department.

6,Child deaths return to haunt minister,"KOLKATA: Health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra admitted on Wednesday that 4,567 children had died in nine state-run hospitals in the city in 2002.

The ministerâ€™s startling admission in reply to a question in the state Assembly severely undermined his claim that West Bengal was the third best in the country in terms of child mortality rate.

Mishra said of nine hospitals, an investigation had been ordered only at the B.C. Roy Memorial Child Hospital where 1,309 child deaths were reported during the year. He said the investigation report had been submitted to the National Human Rights Commission.

The minister said a number of steps, including action against three doctors and an official of the B.C. Roy hospital, had been taken on the basis of the report. He, however, refused to disclose the observations made in the report saying it was with the human rights commission.

This led to a serious altercation between the minister and several Opposition members with some like Abdul Mannan raising questions as to how a report prepared by the state government could be kept secret from members of the House on the pretext that only the NHRC could publish it.

The minister faced a barrage of questions from several Opposition members for his â€œlack of concern over the increasing child deaths in the stateâ€� and his â€œinhuman and condemnable commentsâ€� after the spate of child deaths earlier this year in Lalgola in Murshidabad district. The minister had not bothered to visit the district at the time.

However, an aggressive Mishra told Opposition MLAs that he would â€œalways be arrogant to people who were rudeâ€�, and refused to divulge the contents of the investigation report.

While stating that the child mortality rate in West Bengal was below only Kerala and Tamil Nadu, the minister defended the stateâ€™s decision to do away with incubators from most paediatric wards of state hospitals.

â€œIncubators are old fashioned and passÃ©. New technology and advanced medical science says they may be harmful for babies and so we have now new methods in place,â€� he said.

However, Opposition MLAs refused to buy his argument with Ambika Banerjee alleging that incubators were still used in hospitals across the world and the state health department was trying to hide its deficiencies.

7,Four arrested for 'ISI links',"HYDERABAD: A Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) team, assisted by the state intelligence officers, on Wednesday picked up four men suspected of having links with Gujarat-based ISI agents.

The arrested men are Zameeluddin Ahmed of Santoshnagar, Abdul Samad of Mallepally, Manzoor Siddiqui a resident of SBH Colony in Saidabad and Maulana Mufti Akbar of Karimnagar.

Police sources said that Manzoor was having links with some Gujarat-based ISI activists. Last year, three men suspected to be ISI agents from Gujarat had contacted Manzoor and taken shelter in his house, according to sources.

It was not clear whether Manzoor was part of the Asgar Ali gang involved in the killing of former home minister of Gujarat, Haren Pandya. The man was apprehended near a medical shop in Saidabad when he was going on a two-wheeler along with his friend, according to sources. Saidabad Inspector Vasusena confirmed that Manzoor was picked up by the CBI officials.

Efforts to talk to Manzoorâ€™s family proved fruitless as they locked the house and left soon after they were informed about his arrest.

8,AMC should abide by govt decision : Jadeja,"GANDHINAGAR: State urban development minister IK Jadeja has termed the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation''s resolution appointing Mayor Aneesa Mirza as chairperson of the city''s river front development project ''improper.''

He wished that the corporation would reconsider it and appoint Municipal Commissioner RK Tripathy as chairman.

While replying to queries at his weekly news conference here, the minister said that the government had decided to appoint the commissioner after taking into confidence former mayor Himmatsinh Patel and other senior leaders of the Congress, but unfortunately the standing committee reversed the decision.

He said that the commissioner, being head of the civic administration, could handle the important project in efficient manner and in the larger interests of Ahmedabad and, therefore, the AMC should not make any change in the government''s decision.

9,Krishna rules out early polls,"BANGALORE: Chief Minister S M Krishna on Wednesday ruled out early elections to the state Assembly. Krishna told reporters here that he would stick to the original schedule of October 2004 for conducting the polls.

â€œAs much as it is the prerogative of the Prime Minister to advance the Lok Sabha elections, it is my prerogative as chief minister to hold elections on schedule,â€™â€™ he said.

He said he preferred elections in October. â€œIf there is a direction from my party presidents â€” of the AICC or KPCC â€” as a humble chief minister, I will carry out their orders.â€™â€™

He said the Congress was no longer â€œallergicâ€™â€™ to alliances with the like-minded parties or groups to fight the BJP-led NDA government. He denied any role in preventing the unification of Janata Parivar.

â€œI met Ramakrishna Hegde when he left for London for treatment. When he came back, we did not discuss politics. I will be meeting S.R. Bommai also soon to enquire about his health. Again, there will be speculation. But as and when the occasion demands, Iâ€™ve to meet people.â€™â€™

Asked if he proposes to visit former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda, Krishna quipped: â€œTouch wood, he is in good health.â€™â€™

On consolidating the Congress and preparing for the 2004 elections, Krishna said KPCC chief B. Janardhana Poojary has been given full responsibility. â€œThe Congress is ready for any contingency. Weâ€™ll wait and watch the political developments. You (newspapers) are the best judge to say whether there is an alternative to the Congress in Karnataka.â€™â€™

Asked if former Union minister Ananth Kumar taking over as state BJP president had posed a challenge to the Congress, he said: â€œEvery political party has its own strength. No one can accuse them of not making efforts to win the elections. They will have their own strategies.â€™â€™

Reshuffle: Declining a direct reply on the matter, he said: â€œI am thick in the ongoing legislature session. The trend is to expand the ministry as elections approach. Trimming takes place in the first year of governance.â€™â€™ Asked if his cabinet will touch the 100-mark, Krishna quipped: â€œI hope not.â€™â€™

MLC nominations: Krishna said he would soon complete the exercise of nominations to the Legislative Council.

15,Bihar doctors protest colleague's killing,"PATNA: Peeved over failure of police to nab killers of a medical practitioner, doctors across Bihar on Thursday closed their private clinics much to the suffering of patients.

Doctors decided to close clinics across the state to protest killing of their colleague Om Prakash Verma on Sunday by unidentified persons at Takiapa in Danapur for reportedly refusing to pay extortion money, Indian Medical Association (Bihar unit) general secretary Dr Shahjanand Singh said.

Government hospitals had been exempted from the purview of the strike, Singh said.

The IMA had on Monday set a 48-hour deadline to apprehend the culprits but the police failed to do the needful, he said.

The doctors would also hold a protest rally here to protest Verma''s killing, besides the issue of frequent attacks on the medical fraternity, Singh said.

He further said that the doctors were expected to meet Chief Minister Rabri Devi in this regard soon.

The IMA has demanded protection to the family of the slain doctor and a compensation of Rs 10 lakh, besides a government job to his kin.

16,UN to promote private sector's role in development,"UNITED NATIONS: The United Nations is launching a commission to analyse and evaluate key factors that inhibit the private sector from playing a stronger role in development and fighting poverty in developing countries.

The commission, which will be launched by Secretary General Kofi Annan on Friday, has been established as experts increasingly feel that the involvement of the private sector was essential for the achievement of the world body''s Millennium Development Goals and to meet the challenges facing humanity.

""Its main purpose is to develop strategic recommendations on how to promote a strong, indigenous private sector in developing countries, and to initiate concrete programmes with the highest potential impact in private sector development,"" says Mark Malloch Brown, Administrator of the UN Development Programme (UNDP) and convener of the Commission.

Co-chaired by Canada''s former Finance Minister Paul Martin and former Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo, the group of experts is expected to report back to the Secretary General by the end of the year with policy recommendations for countries and multilateral development agencies.

The decision by such prominent persons to co-chair the Commission ""sends an important signal of their recognition of the role that the private sector is playing as the key engine of growth in developing countries,"" Annan said.

Top-ranking individuals from the private sector, political and academic sectors are among its members.

18,No Indian hand in Quetta attack: Afghan minister,"ISLAMABAD: Rejecting Islamabad''s charge that Indian diplomatic missions in Afghanistan were behind the attack on a mosque in Quetta early this month, visiting Afghan Interior Minister Ali Ahmed Jalali on Thursday said the incident was the result of sectarian violence in Pakistan.

""It is not true that Indian embassy and consulates in Afghanistan had any involvement in the Quetta attack. The incident was the result of sectarian violence in Pakistan. Such incidents take place in Pakistan even when the Indian embassy and consulates were closed,"" Jalali said at a press conference here.

His Pakistani counterpart Faisal Saleh Hayat, who was also present, did not comment on the issue. Pakistani leaders and media had linked the Indian consulates in Afghanistan to the July 4 attack on a Shiite mosque in southwestern Quetta, which left more than 50 dead. Prime Minister Mir Zafarullah Khan Jamali had said that the attack could be a ""fallout"" of the Indian consulates in Kandahar and Herat in Afghanistan and Zahidan in Iran.

Jalali said Afghanistan has also witnessed such incidents by the Taliban and other extremist elements and pointed to the attack on the Iranian consulate in Mazar-e-Sharif, which killed 10 Iranian diplomats and a journalist in 1998.

When asked as to how he can speak on behalf of another country (India), the Afghan Minister retorted, ""How can other people blame a third country for actions in a sovereign country?""

19,No hope for pvt health care: Health minister,"KOLKATA: West Bengal health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra on Thursday expressed his displeasure at the commercialisation of private health care facilities.

""I don''t see any ray of hope and don''t know how to tackle the situation or how to make the system more cost effective but we must keep on trying,"" he said, speaking at the inaugural session of a two-day seminar on Quality Assurance and Cost Effective Methods for Health Care and Hospital Management organised by the Indian Institute of Social Welfare and Business management.

""It is also a matter of concern that the number of cases of non-communicable diseases is on the rise. Stress should be on prevention rather than on the cure,"" Mishra said.

The minister''s speech, however, left much to be expected as the setting was just right for some interesting inputs into the existing health system in West Bengal. Mishra refused to shed any light on the existing health care facilities at the government hospitals.

He stressed on the need to develop low cost technology for the benefit of the masses. ""We have managed to develop an endotrainer for Rs 8,000. This has been installed at the Sambhu Nath Pandit Hospital. Had we tried to procure a similar piece of equipment from an MNC, the cost would have been a few lakhs,"" he said.

It was left to educationist P C Chunder to point out the lacunae that exist in the health system. ""There have been a number of instances when the Grade IV staff at the hospitals don''t work and create a lot of trouble for the administration. This is something that needs to be curbed if quality health facilities are to be provided,"" he said.

Former chief secretary of the state T C Dutt felt that stress should be on domiciliary treatment rather than on hospitalisation. ""There is an increasing knack among people of getting admitted to hospitals, even for minor ailments. When in hospital, people are on the lookout for cabins or special wards where they feel treatment will be better. This is incorrect and puts a lot of pressure on the existing health system,"" he said.

20,Assam tea lobby unhappy with govt's efforts,"GUWAHATI: The Assam government''s efforts to keep the financially powerful tea lobby happy by proposing to bring the tea labourers under the below poverty line (BPL) scheme and reduce the financial burden on the tea companies has been turned down by the union ministry of consumer affairs.

The state government proposal to have the labourers under the BPL scheme was aimed at relieving the tea gardens of a huge chunk of its expenditure incurred against supply of above poverty line (APL) wheat and rice to the labourers at a highly subsidized price that has not been revised since 1951.

Assam food and civil supplies minister Dr Nazrul Islam told TNN, ""The union ministry of consumer affairs has rejected our proposal saying that the regular employees of gardens cannot be brought under BPL scheme as the annual income along with the annual ration of these employees is more than the BPL mark of Rs 15,000.""

With the subsidy factor weighing heavily against them for over fifty years now, tea companies recently moved the state government to bail them out of the crisis and sought introduction of BPL scheme for the labourers, which if implemented would cut off the subsidy by a huge margin.

At present the tea garden labourers are getting wheat at subsidized rate of 54 per kg from the garden management, who purchase it at Rs 620 per quintal under the APL scheme. However, the gardens do not lift the APL rice priced at Rs 830 per quintal, which is higher than that the open market rate of Rs 600 to Rs 800 per quintal.

However, the consumer affairs ministry''s rejection of the government'' proposal has apparently not deterred Chief minister Tarun Gogoi from extending his efforts to the prime minister''s office. Gogoi has dashed off a letter to the Prime Minister on Wednesday last seeking his intervention in getting the proposal through. Gogoi has pleaded for ""easing out the tea industry''s financial problem by allotting foodgrains for its plantation workers at a special concessional rate.

""We can implement this scheme only among the part time and the ex-tea garden labourers. We are now re-assessing the situation and taking into account the ex-tea labourer and the part time labourer."" The minister said that the government would press for introducing the BPL scheme in the sick gardens, which primarily is aimed at the 15 sick gardens of the state-owned Assam Tea Corporation.

""Some of the work were doing on an onsite basis has been converted to offshore model. So, this accounts for the increase in the domestic income,"" Satyam chairman B Ramalinga Raju told reporters on Thursday.

With an other income of Rs 10.7 crore, the company''s total income stood at Rs 570.35 crore. This is an increase by 20.97 per cent over the corresponding period''s Rs 471.48 crore total income.

The company has provided Rs 21.94 crore towards taxation and ended up netting a profit of Rs 121.49 crore. This is an increase of 12.03 per cent from the year-before period''s Rs 108.44 crore.

""Based on the broadbased revenue momentum and the increased opportunities we see in the market, we are increasing our revenue growth guidance for the year. This would now be 18 per cent to 20 per cent up from 15 per cent to 17 per cent stated earlier,"" Raju said.

However, the company has not revised the EPS projection. It had earlier stated that the EPS guidance would be of Rs 15.65 to Rs 16. ""Considering the rupee-dollar fluctuation, we have revised the income guidance in dollar terms. However, when converted to rupee terms the revenue may not change much. Based on this, the EPS guidance remains unchanged,"" Satyam''s chief financial officer V Srinivas said. For the whole year, the company is expecting income from software services to the tune of Rs 2,281 crore to Rs 2,320 crore.

The state government demanded Rs 1.02 lakh crore as devolution of funds from the Centre for the five year period beginning on April 1, 2005, besides Rs 12,000 crore assistance for meeting expenditures for natural calamities and improvement in roads and irrigation facilities. The 11th Finance Commission had agreed to an outlay of only Rs 34,000 crore.

He also sought greater devolution of state''s share of central taxes from 29.5 per cent at present to 50 per cent to match the developmental responsibilities borne by the states.

Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and Dasgupta made no bones about West Bengal''s precarious fiscal situation and sought immediate aid to prevent an imminent financial collapse. â€œApart from the persistent imbalance in Centre-state relations, national-level natural calamities accentuated the crisis,â€� Bhattacharjee told the commission.

The chief minister argued that while the Centre''s development expenditure in 2001-02 was Rs 1.39 lakh crore against Rs 3.5 lakh crore borne by the states, two-thirds of the revenue was collected by the Centre. Besides, the salary burden on states that had doubled following the implementation of Fifth Pay Commission recommendations.

Mounting debt burden on states with the Centre borrowing money from the market at 6 per cent and lending it to the states at 10.5 per cent and a shortfall in revenue collection by both Centre and states were also shown as reasons for the financial crisis.

To reduce the interest outgo that amounts to a whopping 49 per cent of West Bengal''s revenue receipts, the finance minister wanted the Centre to allow states greater market borrowing to retire high interest debts at 12 per cent by money raised at six per cent from the market. He, however, rejected a debt swap scheme offered by the Centre earlier.

Replying to newspersons'' questions on the state''s creditworthiness, Dasgupta pointed out while the budget size of all 28 states put together was Rs 4.02 lakh crore against Rs 3.9 lakh crore of the Centre in 2001-02, the revenue deficit of states was at Rs 44,000 crore against Rs 80,000 crore of the Centre.

â€œWhen we issue bonds, it is always over-subscribed,â€� Dasgupta said. In 2001-02, while the Centre was allowed to borrow Rs 1.13 lakh crore, states were allowed to tap the market for only Rs 17,000 crore.

Claiming improvement in revenue collection by the state government through levy of user service charges in several sectors and checking growth in the salary and pension bills, the finance minister chalked out a recovery path that contained reintroduction of the voluntary disclosure of income scheme that had netted Rs 10,000 crore black money during the United Front government''s regime in the mid-90s.

23,Docs challenge govt order in court,"KOLKATA: The Calcutta High Court on Wednesday directed the West Bengal government, the West Bengal Medical Council (WBMC) and other respondents to file affidavits within three weeks on an application by Indian Board of Alternative Medicine (IBAM), Kolkata, challenging a government circular against them.

The circular, published recently in newspapers, had requested the city police commissioner to take steps against a few fake medical institutions which were mushrooming in the city and were offering fake degrees in alternative medicines. The police were also requested to take steps against fake doctors who were practicing alternative medicines.

The IBAM filed the application on the strength of an earlier High Court judgement passed in 1990 allowing some institutions to impart training and education in alternative mdicine to the interested students.

Earlier, the IBAM, registered under the West Bengal Society Registration Act, had filed a writ petition in 1996 against various actions taken by state government for curbing the practice of Alternative Medicine on the ground that so called alternative medicine doctors have been practicing particularly in remote areas by prescribing allopathic or homoepathic medicines.

The state government took steps on the plea that those fake doctors were not recognised by any medical council or by the state or by the Centre under any statute.

WBMC counsel Saibalendu Bhowmick earlier, in opposition to the petitioner, had contended that those so called doctors had been using the abbreviations â€˜MBBS (AM)â€™ or â€˜MS (AM)â€™ which were very much synonimus to the regular degrees of registered doctors like MBBS and MD in allopathic medical practice.

Bhowmick further had alleged that those fake doctors were prescribing allopathic and other recognised medicines those were strictly prihibited under Bengal Medical Act and the Indian Medical Council Act. The Supreme Court in a case had restrained the doctors practcing in a particular system to practice and prescribe medicine in other system, Bhowmick had added.

The matter came up for hearing on Wednesday before justice Maharaja Sinha. Though the state government was a party to the case none appeared on behalf of them.

The court, however, while directing to file affidavit further directed to maintain status quo in this matter.

24,Attacks put a strain on Mufti's healing touch policy,"SRINAGAR: Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed''s ""healing touch'''' policy will come under severe strain following the latest terrorist attacks on an Army camp in Akhnoor and on pilgrims at Katra.

After the incident in which a brigadier and seven jawans were killed, the Army will not only be tightening security but will also intensify its counter-insurgency operations. Although the Army has promised to minimise its own and civilian casualties in its future operations, these cannot be ruled out completely. This could end up compounding the Mufti''s worries as questions will then be raised about his election promise to minimise harassment and human rights violations by security personnel.

As it is, the Mufti has been doing a tightrope walk ever since he came to power nine months ago. On one hand, he has to keep his promise to provide a ""healing touch'''' to people of the strife-torn state. And yet his government can hardly afford to let down its guard as it is officially admitted that infiltration in J&K is still continuing and that another 2,500 to 3,000 militants are already operating in the state. The latest terrorist attacks have only strengthened the case for allowing greater freedom and flexibility to the security forces.

To some extent, the Mufti has ensured that the common man is not subjected to harassment from security forces. The visible presence of security forces personnel, at least in Srinagar, has been reduced. On the other hand, there were three custodial deaths in the space of five days last week. While the Mufti''s government has been quick to respond whenever any such incident takes place in this case he immediately ordered a judicial probe disillusionment among the people is building up.

More and more people are questioning the efficacy of the CM''s healing touch. ""The government claims it has disbanded the dreaded Special Operations Group...the name might have changed but the old atrocities continue,'''' remarked a Srinagar resident. Others describe the Mufti''s much-touted healing touch policy as a mere facade for, according to them, nothing has changed on the ground.

The Mufti''s aides are well aware that these incidents of civilian deaths are not being received well by the public. But they maintain though the scale of violence has come down since their government came to power, all such cases get magnified as ""people do not expect that any such incident will take place during our regime''''.

25,Stringent laws for panchayat polls,"KOLKATA: In the wake of large-scale violence in the just concluded panchayat polls, Left Front government is poised to enact a law making violence in polling stations, booth capturing, instigation of communal or class hatred and other malpractice a cognizable offence punishable with prison terms. Persons convicted for ''moral turpitude'' or dismissed from government jobs and panchayats would be barred from contesting.

The West Bengal Pancahayat Election bill 2003 will be discussed in the state assembly on Saturday. The Opposition is apprehensive about the ''real designs'' behind the bill, it made the state election commission solely responsible for conducting the panchayat polls. The bill apparently is meant for a '' closer convergence'' between the pancayats election election procedure and the Lok Sabha and Bidhansabha polls.

Communal and other hate campaign will be punished by three years prison term. Booth capturing will invite one to three years prison terms while it will be three years in case the accused is a state government employee. Removal of ballot papers would fetch one year term while it will go upto two years in case anybody except cops carry weapons near the polling booths.

Even misconduct inside the poll stations would be punishable. No canvassing will be allowed near booths and any officials on poll duty influences voters on behalf of any party may land in jail for six months.Violation of secrecy of the polls by election officials and others will fetch three months terms.

More controversial will be the criteria for recognition of local political parties. The bill says that such parties will have to be engaged in political activities for a continuous five years.

All disputes regarding the validity of polls will be judged by civil judge in respect to gram panchayt and panchayat Samiti and by the district judge in case of Zila parisad. No MP, MLA or municipality member would be allowed to retain their panchayat berths neither any person will be allowed to contest all the three tiers.

26,Sena activists rough up ‘extortionist’ principal,"MUMBAI: Approximately 60 Shiv Sena activists roughed up the principal of Mulund High School on Thursday, alleging that the school admitted students who had failed in other schools after extorting money from them.

The activists slapped the principal A.K.Meghani, who immediately went down on his knees and promised to return the money to the parents by Monday. The school authorities were not available for comment.

Sanjay Mashilkar, the shaka pramukh who led the delegation, claimed that a Mulund resident had told him that the school had asked her to pay Rs 50,000 for admitting her two children to standard four and standard six. The children had been asked to leave Lawrence high school and junior college, Thane, after they failed twice.

The woman had already paid Rs 35,000. But when she could not pay the remaining amount, senior school officials called and threatened to expel her children, Mr Mashilkar said.

He claimed that the school had turned down his repeated requests to forego the remainder. â€œWhen they continued to insist on payment, we decided to take a morcha to the school,â€™â€™ Mr Mashilkar said.

Asked why the activists decided to act themselves instead of approaching the police, he said that it was for the education officials to approach the police. When the news report appears, they will take it up, Mr Mashilkar said.

27,Cong withdraws bill for govt takeover of Shirdi temple,"MUMBAI: The Nationalist Congress Party on Thursday forced the Congress to withdraw a bill providing for the government takeover of the hugely popular Sai Baba temple at Shirdi in Ahmednagar district on Thursday.

â€œIt was Babaâ€™s miracle at work,â€™â€™ said an NCP activist.

Internal conflicts in the ruling Democratic Front came into the open in the Maharashtra legislative council when law and judiciary minister Govindrao Adik announced that the bill,which was introduced on Monday, was being withdrawn. The bill will now go to a select committee of the house.

Senior NCP member Vasant Chavanâ€™s prolonged argument made it absolutely clear that the Congress had been caught on the wrong foot on the issue of controlling the temple, which is reputed to be second only to the Balaji temple at Tirupati in terms of wealth and the number of devotees it attracts.

28,"Panned by Amnesty, govt shuts door on its chief","MUMBAI: In an unprecedented move, the government of India has denied an entry visa to Irene Khan Zubeida, the secretary general of the UK-based human rights group Amnesty International.

The Bangladesh-born Ms Zubeida, who took charge in 2001, had planned her first visit to the sub-continent from July 9 this year.

Sources said that Ms Zubeidaâ€™s visa application had been rejected by the Indian high commissionerâ€™s office in London without mentioning a specific reason.

The refusal of a visa to the chief of the world-renowned human rights body comes close on the heels of the organisation mobilising its members from around the world to call on the government of India to carry out a re-trial of the Best Bakery case and commence other trials in riot cases in Gujarat last year.

Amnesty International has been critical of the Indian governmentâ€™s record on human rights violations, the denial of justice to women with reference to the Gujarat riots as well as the rehabilitation of tribals affected by the Narmada dam.

Officials in Delhiâ€™s Amnesty India office confirmed to TNN that a visa been denied to their secretary general, who was supposed to be on an official visit to its India office. â€œWe are making a public statement regarding this development,â€™â€™ a senior official of the organisation said. Vijay Nagaraj, India co-ordinator of Amnesty India, however, refused to comment the issue.

In its report published in February this year, the international body criticised the role of the government the Gujarat riots. It said, â€œthe constitutional rights and in particular the right to redress continued to be violated the state.â€™â€™

The manner in which the police investigated the massacres highlighted a severe bias against Muslims and survivors, the report said.

â€œAt the time of the violence in Gujarat, India dismissed international expressions concern as â€˜interferenceâ€™, arguing Indiaâ€™s criminal justice system and other institutions, including the National Human Rights Commission, would able adequately to address the situation in Gujarat.

â€œThose statements today appear hollow,â€™â€™ Amnesty had said in its latest report in July.
