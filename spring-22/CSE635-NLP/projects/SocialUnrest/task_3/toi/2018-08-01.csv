1,Oust BJP government' from Aug 9: Jaiswal,"lucknow: the state unit of the congress on tuesday gave a call for `oust bjp government' beginning august 9 to coincide with the quit india movement. addressing a press conference, upcc president shri prakash jaiswal said that torchlight processions would be taken out on august 9 all over the state in the evening. meetings and rallies would also be held at the block headquarters which would continue the next day also. similar rallies would be held at the tehsil headquarters on august 13 and in district headquarters from august 14 to 16. on august 20, which would be the last day of the first phase of the `oust bjp government'programme, a massive dharna would be organized near the statue of mahatma gandhi in lucknow. workers from all over the state would be participating in this dharna, he said. the objective of the 10-day programme would be to mobilise support for the ouster of the bjp government by highlighting the plight of the farmers, dalits, the backward classes and the other weaker sections of the society. jaiswal said in up there was a complete breakdown of the constitutional machinery, with the legislature and the executive unable to work independently. he said the state was in the grip of mafias and referred to the murders and kidnappings of leading industrialists, doctors and businnesmen. the upcc president referred to the murder of phoolan devi and said it appeared more like a well organized design of the bjp government and the sangh parivar to eliminate opposition members. clarifying, he said since law and order came directly under the home department, phoolan's killing was the result of a near absence of law and order. jaiswal said that extra constituional institutions like the rss, vhp and bajrang dal were virtually controlling the government and referred to the massacre of dalits in mirzapur, aligarh and fatehpur districts, in this connection.

8,"Abdullah hits out at RSS, VHP; hints at early polls","new delhi: expressing strong displeasure over continued opposition by ""vested interests"" to the autonomy resolution passed by the jammu and kashmir assembly, chief minister farooq abdullah on wednesday hinted at an early poll saying ""if need arises my government will again go to the people and seek a fresh mandate."" ""one has to understand that, i was elected to the post of chief minister not to hatch eggs but on my party's manifesto which promised greater autonomy to the state... if the centre is unwilling to even hold talks then i think it is time to go back to the people,"" abdullah, who met several union ministers during his three day stay in the capital, said here. ""if the need arises, i may seek a fresh mandate later this year,"" the chief minister said. charging some ""vested interests"" in the ruling national democratic alliance and other religious-political fronts like rss and vhp with trying to sabotage the autonomy resolution, abdullah said, ""i had put up the resolution for a debate and the union cabinet did not even find it worth a proper reading and rejected it."" asked whether he was venting his anger or holding out a threat of early elections, the chief minister said, ""i do not believe in threatening. i have full confidence in the leadership of prime minister atal bihari vajpayee and i hope the cabinet will soon initiate a dialogue on the autonomy resolution."" asked about the recent statement of union home minister l k advani in parliament that the centre will not grant the pre-1953 status to jammu and kashmir, the chief minister said, ""i have never asked for a pre-1953 position and it is only misinformation being spread against the genuine wishes of the people."" ""my only case is that let us debate and arrive at an agreeable solution on the issue of autonomy,"" abdullah said, and added: ""at least i have not committed a sin and my demand is very much within the constitution of the country."" he claimed that no other package would be acceptable to the state government or the people of the state. ""this resolution represents the widest aspiration of people of the state and no government can afford to ignore it for long,"" he said. asked how hopeful he was about an early dialogue on the autonomy resolution, abdullah said: ""you know hope never dies and so is the case with me. one day the centre will have to accept that autonomy is the only solution to the kashmir problem."" about the continued militancy in the state, he said militancy had been trying to raise its ""ugly head but the security forces in the state were alert."" abdullah said he had conveyed to pakistan president pervez musharraf during the lunch hosted by the prime minister that ""people in india and pakistan want peace and god has given you an opportunity... of course, he (musharraf) did not click on to it later."" abdullah said it is unfortunate that pakistani rulers make their people get into the ""bogey of kashmir"" and forget other issues. ""they could at least have a dialogue on visa relaxation, trade and other such issues which could have provided a milestone in finding a solution to the kashmir issue,"" the chief minister said. highlighting the achievements of his government, which will soon be completing five years in office, abdullah said, ""the state government provided employment to nearly one lakh youth besides re-establishing law and order in the state."" the jammu and kashmir assembly has had the unique distinction in the country of completing a term of six years.

10,FIEO suggests flexbility in labour laws,"new delhi: in order to make labour laws more flexible, federation of indian export organisations (fieo) has made a series of suggestions specific to the export sector to the second national commission on labour (ncl). some of the ideas, say labour unions, are so outrageous that if implemented it will lead to unrest. fieo has asked that exporters should be granted the prerogative for retaining the workforce depending on their visibility in the business enterprise. the reason, says fieo, is that export is a dynamic business with variations in the volume of work depending on orders received from overseas buyers. highlighting the chinese laws wherein each individual enterprise has an agreement with their workers individually or severally, fieo has asked that the same be applied for indian exporters. in case of contract labour act, 1970, fieo has suggested that in case a worker wants to work overtime voluntarily, he should be allowed to earn more wages without attracting the provisions of double payment for overtime. also, in activities like loading, packing, gardening and canteen work only contract labour be employed. also, women workers should be allowed to work after the second shift. similarly, industrial disputes act, says fieo, be so amended that the term ""public utility service"" and ""exporting units"" be replaced by ""any exporting organisation."" the clause ""14 days of giving such notice"" must be replaced by at least 30 days. also, sections of the act requiring prior permission for lay-off, retrenchment and closure should be deleted. on social security schemes, fieo wants that employees provident fund, employees state insurance act, maternity benefits act, workmen's compensation act, payment of gratuity act be clubbed together. ""these acts are very cumbersome... it is difficult for exporters in the small and medium sector to maintain and comply with the various procedures involved in the same,"" fieo argues. however, a senior labour ministry official is not so sure if all the suggestions made by the fieo will find favour with ncl. says he, ""commission has already shown its displeasure over finance minister's announcement of amendments in labour laws. moreover, many of fieo's suggestions will not find favour with members of nda.""

11,Rajasthan govt rejects subquotas,"new delhi: the rajasthan government's decision to reject subquotas within the reservation for backward classes has come as a shot in the arm for the opponents of a similar exclusive reservation for most backward classes decided upon by the rajnath singh government in uttar pradesh. the rajasthan government rejected the proposals of the obc commission for dividing 21 per cent reservation for backward classes into three categories saying ""the classification has no scientific or logical basis and no survey based on economic, educational and social status of the classified castes was done by the commission"". rajnath singh, seeking to lead the bjp-led coalition in the assembly polls scheduled for early 2002, sought to play the card of quota within quota for the most backward castes. the move was seen by observers as aimed at striking at the support base of the samajwadi party by utilising the contradictions within the backward classes. bsp has lent support to the idea and since then mulayam singh yadav too has been asking better-off sections among the obcs to make sacrifices for the less fortunate ones, but the move has been strongly opposed by some members of the rajnath ministry itself belonging to backward classes, particularly om prakash singh and ashok yadav.

13,'Use foodgrains for watershed development',"pune: the man who helped india create surplus food stocks through the green revolution is now pleading with the government to use surplus foodgrains to combat poverty. noted agricultural scientist, dr m s swaminathan has been repeatedly urging the government to create ""community grain banks as an instrument to create water banks"" and promote ecological restoration of the villages. pointing out to the paradox of ""grain mountains and hungry millions"" in the country, dr swaminathan has proposed that the surplus grains could be used to generate employment for developmental works in villages. ""a number of soil and water conservation programmes could be undertaken in the country through a food-for-work programme,"" dr swaminathan said while addressing a news conference here on wednesday. he was here to receive the tilak award instituted in the memory of lokmanya tilak. he regretted that despite surplus foodgrain stocks of 65 million tonnes in the country, there were millions going hungry as they could not afford foodgrains. he said that india needed stocks of barely 20 million tonnes to ensure its food security. even a small portion of the remaining stocks could be used to ensure food security at the individual level and promote ecological development in the country. ""we have proposed to the government that it should create community grain banks in a food-for-work programme and employ labour for ecological restoration of villages,"" dr swaminathan said. he said that a number of water harvesting projects could be undertaken through this programme which could simultaneously help in combating malnutrition and in generating developmental works. dr swaminathan said that the government was seriously examining the proposal and prime minister atal bihari vajpayee had established a committee headed by the agriculture minister to look into the scheme. the agricultural scientist has suggested that ""community grain banks each with 200 tonnes of wheat or rice or locally acceptable staples could be established in ""hunger hotspots"" villages."" these banks could then be used food-for-work or food-for- nutrition programmes, wasteland and watershed development and ecological restoration of villages.

14,Mother-in-law as an agent of change,"bangalore: sixty-year-old gangamma frowns as she holds up a strip of birth control pills. the message she's getting isn't a welcome one. a young doctor is trying to get her to warm up to a new idea -- birth control for her daughter-in-law -- an uncomfortable change for gangamma who's too used to telling her son's wife what to do. this could well be a scene from tu-tu-mein-mein, where the mother-in-law tries to call the shots. but in this case it indicates the progress being made by the bangalore city corporation to get some good work done. as part of the india population project (viii), an outreach programme is being conducted for mothers-in-law throughout 500 slums. here, a group of doctors talk to mothers-in-law about the positive results of birth control methods. and in turn, all the mothers-in-law who have manage to convert to the idea, talk to their friends about how good it is. most of the young mothers in slums have more than two children. this means that most of the children don't even have access to a decent village education. while they may be open to the idea of a tubectomy or using copper t, the mother-in-law gets in the way. the bcc health officers found that they had to talk to the mothers-in-law if the wanted to make a difference. known as the focus group, the mothers-in-law were asked to gather on a regular basis and talk about their fears related to birth control, one of which included the fear of losing control or importance. once the programme was initiated at the 55 health centres, the `good' mothers-in-law spoke to the others and tried to convince them. this week, an unusual mix of women gathered at gutadahalli anganwadi to discuss this equally odd subject. says puttamma, a mother-in-law, who has come to attend the programme, ""if you have an operation, you can't work. i never had an operation, daughter-in-law doesn't need to have one either."" dr m n sandhya, a medical officer, is working along with dr parimala to get these women comfortable with the idea of birth control. they have carried condoms, birth control pills and copper t along with them and are showing them to the older women. ""this group has around 20 ladies. initially, they were reluctant to tell me about their fears, but now they have opened up,"" says dr sandhya. she explains that one of the messages she gives includes the benefits of having a small family. ""often, the women are made to have children till she gives birth to a son. girls are still considered unlucky in many places and we try to change that,"" she explains. at meetings like this women like gowramma stand up and talk to the others about how it's best to have just two children. she says, ""at least that way you can keep an eye on your children and make them good citizens. also never shout at your daughter-in-law in front of the neighbours. treat her as your own daughter.""

17,Industrial policy to boost technology: Govt,"bangalore: industries minister r.v. deshpande on wednesday maintained that karnataka is the first state to introduce industry deregulation measures as well as setting aside massive funds for infrastructure and technology upgradation. replying to d.h. shankara murthy (bjp) on the new industrial policy in the council, deshpande said the karnataka udyog mitra, which had been made the nodal agency to implement deregulation measures, will be given more powers for better coordination and discharge of functions. ``the thrust of the new policy is on hrd, infrastructure, technology upgradation and research orientation. we have set aside rs 100 crore for infrastructure and rs 5 crore for technology upgradation. there is recession due to the overall economic slowdown, but it will pick up,'' he said. as for concessions, deshpande said no sales tax exemption will be given for new industries except for those in the pipeline, whereas entry tax exemptions, up to 50 per cent exemption on stamp duties and subsidies for some industries, were given to create a level-playing field.'' to a question on the global investors meet (gim) raised by m.v. rajashekaran (congress), b.l. shankar (jd), b.s. yediyurappa (bjp) and basavaraj bommai (jd-s), deshpande said there had been a delay in setting up the industries because the gestation period between signing agreements and the physical set up coming up is between 18 months and three years. ``we have devised fast-track mechanism whereby instead of over 30 procedures, it has been reduced to just three. approval for industries is given within 35 days, or if nothing is forthcoming from the department, permission is deemed to have been given after this period,'' he informed. of the 254 agreements signed during gim, 36 have already been started, 76 are in different stages of implementation and 119 in process of being approved. deshpande agreed that industries were, at the moment, concentrated in and around bangalore, with over 120 approved during gim. ``we are making efforts to attract investment in other parts of the state. under the new policy, we have put bangalore in `a' zone which enjoys no exemptions or concessions, and yet investors want to set up units here. how can we turn them down,'' he asked. on accusations that the government is neglecting the agriculture sector, deshpande said 26 agro-based industries have been approved, leading to an investment of nearly rs 780 crore. ``the state intends to establish five food processing parks, out of which the centre has granted permission to set up two in bagalkot and malur,'' he added.

18,Building bye-laws violations placed under scanner,"bangalore: the violation of building bye-laws by a minister's relative has brought to light the increasing number of deviations and also the ``i-do-not-care'' attitude of the offenders. last week, during the bcc council meeting, some corporators raised a furore about a building on commercial street which they said was being renovated allegedly in blatant violation of the rules. while the bcc has approved the plan only for renovation of the building, the owner had gone ahead to reconstruct the building, they alleged. according to sources, the owner of the building has replied to the notice stating that the building in question was coming up as per the rules and the sanctioned plan. however, the bcc is not satisfied with the reply and has decided to issue a confirmation order -- which is issued to confirm the offence prior to issuing a demolition notice. the incident is yet another example of building bye-law violations which has increased by leaps and bounds. as per a recent study conducted by the institute of town planners, bangalore, the city has a staggering 50,000 or more illegal constructions with over 300 per cent deviations. the bcc sources said several buildings which have more than 100 per cent deviations are free of litigation and are ready for bcc's action. however, the bcc or the government do not seem to be keen on initiating action against the violators. two years ago, the bangalore metropolitan task force had identified 21 multi-storey buildings which had deviations to the tune of more than 211 per cent. the cases were referred to the government which subsequently asked the bcc to demolish the buildings. but the cases have been gathering dust. same is the case of 32 restaurants in the city situated in the basements. though the law specifies that the basements be used only for parking and not to carry out any commercial activity, these hotels have been functioning despite the non-renewal of the trade licences. though the high court has cleared the cases, it has asked the government to listen to the aggrieved parties and instruct the bcc to initiate action. till date, there has been no response by the government on this issue. ``the bcc is also confused about initiating action as the building bye-laws say that deviations up to five per cent can be regularised. but most of the buildings have more than five per cent violations and the bcc is in a fix whether to collect compounding fees and regularise it or demolish it,'' the sources said.

20,Poll panel seeks govt directive on reservation issue,"patna: the state election commission (sec) has sought directive from the secretary of the urban development department on reservation of the posts of chairpersons of the patna, muzaffarpur, darbhanga, gaya and bhagalpur municipal corporations for scheduled castes, scheduled tribes and women in the coming local bodies elections. the joint election commissioner, in a letter dated july 31 to the urban development department secretary, stated that the sec is of the view that the elections for these five municipal corporations are to be held under the provisions of the patna municipal corporation act, 1951. but no provision for reservation of the post of municipal corporation chairperson for scs, sts and women has been made in the patna municipal corporation act, 1951. since the reservation of the posts of chairpersons is mandatory according to the constitutional provisions, the patna municipal corporation act, 1951 becomes unconstitutional and hence it is impossible for the sec to implement the mandatory provisions of the constitution while holding elections for the posts of chairpersons of the five municipal corporations, the sec official maintained. the joint election commissioner asked the secretary to state the process through which reservation of the posts of chairpersons of the five municipal corporations can be made for scs, sts and women according to the constitutional provisions in the coming elections.
