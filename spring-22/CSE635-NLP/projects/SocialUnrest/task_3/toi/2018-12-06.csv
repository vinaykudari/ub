2,Inquiries double since WTC attacks,"pune: if foreign universities are holding education fairs in india to woo indian students to their shores, the university of pune is pitching for foreign students to study here. it is also banking on students from developing countries and arab states, who may otherwise have chosen american or european universities, doing a rethink post september 11, and finding a warmer welcome in pune. the international centre of the university will showcase what it has to offer at a two-day youth festival which begins in the city on december 8. representatives of several foreign diplomatic missions are to be present to look and learn and hopefully send a positive message back home. the university is gearing up to admit at least 1,500 international students in the next academic session. ""this will be an increase of 115 per cent over the intake this year,"" reveals university deputy registrar sitaram joshi. ""this year, the university admitted 676 students from 45 countries in 84 courses, with yemen topping the list with 115 students, followed by iran with 88, and mauritius with 75. although the international centre seems hesistant to link the additional admissions with the world affairs in aftermath of the wtc attacks, sources reveal it has been receiving inquiries from different embassies about the conditions available in the varisity. ""we recently got a call from the consulate general's office of yemen asking if more students from the country could get admissions here,"" a senior source said. the university has made entrance procedures for foreign students easier. dr shantishree pandit, director of the international centre claims that it is the only varsity in the country to have a single window cell for all affairs related to foreign students.

3,Officials hail ban on extremist outfits under terror law,"patna: state police officials have hailed the centre's action in banning the extremist outfits maoist communist centre (mcc) and people's war group (pwg) under the provisions of prevention of terrorism ordinance (poto) on wednesday. officials at the police headquarters here said now the extremists can be booked under the stringent provisions of poto, which would help them tackle effectively the activities of the banned extremist outfits. the police have been given sufficient powers to book extremists. the significant aspect of the ordinance is the admissibility of confession made by an alleged extremist before a police officer, an official said, adding that this provision would help the field officers tame the extremists. the police officials, quite contrary to the stand taken by the rjd-led government in bihar, lauded the effort of the centre and expressed the hope that the poto would soon become an act. rjd supremo laloo prasad yadav had earlier rejected the centre's move to get the poto bill passed in parliament, saying that bihar would never implement it as it reminded him of the internal emergency days of 1975. though the bihar government had already banned the activities of the two outfits a few years ago, the police had no option but to book such elements under the softer provisions of the indian penal code, the officials maintained. a police officer said that the politicians should rise above petty politics and think of the national interest. they must get the bill passed by parliament at the earliest as otherwise the act concerned would not come into effect. this would certainly be detrimental to the effective handling of the extremist problem in bihar, added another police official. the two outfits have expanded their areas of operation in andhra pradesh, jharkhand, bihar, madhya pradesh and chhattisgarh and are now spreading their tentacles on the bihar-nepal border. during the last two months, the two outfits have killed a dozen police personnel and looted nearly two dozen firearms and ammunition by carrying out landmine blasts in different parts of bihar. the developments in nepal, where extremists made a series of killings, have alarmed both the union and bihar governments.

4,World Bank censures govt on education project,"patna: the state is lagging behind in the implementation of centrally sponsored and world bank (wb) aided phase three of the district primary education project (dpep). this has been referred to in a communication sent to bihar chief secretary by union human resource development secretary b k chaturvedi. the state government has failed to utilise the fund, chaturvedi's communication has stated, adding that the expenditure had been only 32 per cent of the target till the review made in june 30 this year. consequently, the world bank has directed that the project be restructured, as is evident from chaturvedi's letter. according to the communication, under the project, a large number of vacancies of teachers still remained unfilled. while the agreement with the world bank stipulates that the vacancies of teachers should not exceed 5 per cent of the total, the current vacancy of posts of teachers, however, was around 15 per cent. this largescale vacancy is not only a breach of covenant, but, more importantly, these large scale vacancies have a very adverse impact on any effort to achieve the goal of universalisation of elementary education, chaturvedi has pointed out. the state government has been asked to finalise the state policy for the recruitment of teachers at the earliest, as this had lingered on for a long time. chaturvedi's communication has also mentioned that 170 posts for the project staff of the dpep in the state and district offices still remained vacant. while steps have been initiated to fill up these vacancies, we are told that the reservation roster is yet to be cleared by the government, chaturvedi has stated, insisting that the same should be expeditiously completed. with regard to civil works, chaturvedi has stated that a close watch should be kept both on the pace of construction and also on the quality of school buildings constructed under the project. chaturvedi has said even though the timely supply of textbooks had improved, supplies continued to be made till the end of the academic year. the state government has been asked to streamline the position of supply of textbooks for children at the beginning of the academic year.

11,"Development challenges should be area-specific, says Digvijay","mumbai: departing from the conventional approach to major development challenges such as those of nutrition, literacy and population, madhya pradesh chief minister digvijay singh said here on tuesday that it was time planners stopped seeing them as ``indian challenges'' at the national level and evolved state-specific strategies, and within them, district-specific action plans. ``if you take nutrition, kerala and tamil nadu as well as punjab and himachal pradesh have substantially addressed this problem whereas in the field of literacy and basic education, most states in the south, west and east, except orissa, have moved to satisfactory levels,'' he said, adding that for curbing the rise in population, india now needed to move beyond even states and focus on ``problem districts''. mr singh was speaking on the `roles and responsibilities of panchayats in population, health and development' at the seventh jrd tata memorial oration. citing the example of madhya pradesh, he said that out of its 45 districts, there were 14 districts that needed attention as they had not shown a declining trend in population. madhya pradesh, he stressed, was better able to do this because of the framework of decentralisation and the panchayati raj in the state. according to the 2001 census, the population growth in madhya pradesh has come down from 27.24 per cent to 24.34 per cent, while the national growth rate has reduced from 23.82 per cent to 21.34 per cent. ``this is the first time mp has recorded a reduction in its rate of growth of population and we believe this has happened largely because of the impact of panchayati raj in our state,'' said the cm. the mp experience on population reduction, mr singh said, pointed out that only multi-sectoral action was effective. the mantra is action across sectors __education, poverty reduction, nutrition, community and citizen empowerment along with the health sector in areas such as infant mortality. the mp government has initiated the health services guarantee scheme and has trained 18,000 barefoot doctors to implement it. asked if the mp government was not letting loose quacks on the people, mr singh explained that these community health workers were given a six-month intensive training after which they passed a tough examination. ``since qualified doctors do not want to go to the villages, the choice we have is between a trained quack and an untrained quack,'' he quipped. mr singh allayed fears about bureaucrats, the feudal system and corruption derailing the panchayati raj. once the bureaucracy realised that politicians meant business, he said, they would fall in line. and, corruption, he said, could be controlled to a large extent by making procedures transparent and by implementing the right to information act. the cm said that the panchayati raj was slowly breaking the stranglehold of feudalism over society and that firm action by the administration was aiding the process. he pointed out the instance of the dalit woman sarpanch of bhikamgarh, who was invited to hoist the national flag at the district headquarters after it came to light that she was not allowed to unfurl the tricolour on the republic day. ``of course, action was also taken against the villagers who prevented her from doing so,'' he added. stressing the need to see people as a strategic resource, mr singh said that it was important to move from an understanding of panchayats as mere agents of the state or as the lowest tier of the government. ``instead of seeing panchayats as contractors for social mobilisation, we need to see them as units of local government who have been empowered to intervene in areas that can affect population reduction__be it health, education, nutrition, potable water, sanitation or poverty reduction.''

17,"Bouquet for CM, brickbat for partymen","lucknow: kushabhau thakre, incharge of up affairs, patted chief minister rajnath singh for his good governance but admonished party workers for being highly ambitious. thakre asked the party workers not to feel disenchanted if they were denied tickets to contest elections. rajnath singh government has done a good job. social barriers have been broken. if we lose this election it will not be because of the failure of the government but because of disenchanted workers who may not work wholeheartedly, he said. the warning was not received kindly by party workers, a section of whom had opposed party leaders' attempt to give tickets to allies at the expense of bjp leaders. suresh saini, district president of moradabad, was among the prominent dissenters. he was opposed to the bjp move to ally with rashtriya lok dal in western up. one thing party leaders and workers should understand is that all of them cannot contest elections. i do not need candidates, i need dedicated workers who are ready to work to bring the party back to power, thakre said. tear all those biodata and applications you have brought with you and get ready to face elections, he told the workers. according to thakre, the elections in up would be held before february 15. we have got only 70-plus days. do not waste a single day, he told them. thakre was speaking on the concluding day of the two-day working committee meet here on wednesday. the meeting discussed at length management of election. district presidents were also invited to air their views about the election manifesto. every ruling party has anti-incumbency factor working against it but rajnath's government had taken some pro-people steps which have helped in nullifying this effect, thakre said. but those achievements had failed to reach the masses as the beneficiaries do not read government press releases, thakre said and added: party workers should carry the message to the public to build a pro-bjp atmosphere. he said the workers should understand that 'we cannot ignore allies at this stage'. chief minister rajnath singh admitted that his government had not been able to provide benefits to party workers. he explained that it was very difficult to transfer officials as per workers' demand.

18,TDR deal: Plea for stay on govt order withdrawn,"mumbai: a division bench of the bombay high court on tuesday allowed rommel estate private limited to withdraw its petition, which had sought a stay against the state government's order stopping a tdr (transfer of development rights) transaction between it and the maharashtra housing and development agency. justice a.p. shah and justice s.a. bobde were on the verge of dismissing the petition at the admission stage itself. however, rommel's advocate requested the court to allow the petition to be withdrawn. mhada's move to surrender two lakh sq ft of its expensive slum tdr in exchange for the relatively cheap road tdr of proportionate size with romell in september was viewed as highly questionable by the government. the court found no merit in the petitioner's plea that the stay given by the state housing department and the lok ayukta against the tdr transaction was ``illegal, arbitrary, capricious and passed without any application of mind and amounted to gross abuse of power''. the lok ayukta's office, which is already conducting an inquiry into the transaction, is likely to submit its report to the state government in the next few days. government sources had termed this transaction as ``dubious'' as mhada had never undertaken such a deal in the past. rommel's attempt to approach the court and get a stay against the state government's order comes at a time when several mlas and mlcs have submitted probing questions regarding this controversial deal during the ongoing winter session of the state legislature in nagpur. shiv sena mlc shishir shinde is one those who has decided to take up this issue as and when it comes up for discussion. ``if the court had admitted rommel's petition, the matter would have been treated as sub judice by the government in the assembly,'' sources said. the controversial agreement was initiated by mhada vice-president and chief executive officer uttam khobragade and approved by the board. he is currently in nagpur and may be summoned by the house to explain and justify the transaction, which has now been stayed pending an inquiry by the lok ayukta and the housing department. mr khobragade had earlier defended his decision, saying that mhada would have gained rs 50 lakhs from the transaction. however, government sources observed that if the transaction had been carried out, mhada would have lost rs 8-9 crores as the difference between slum and road tdr is as high as rs 350-rs 400 per sq ft. chief secretary v. ranganathan had asked the housing department to conduct an inquiry after he received an anonymous letter exposing how mhada had exchanged its slum tdr without calling for any tenders. the housing board wanted to purchase road tdr for its projects in swadeshi mills at chunabhati and at goregaon. on august 30, 2001 romell put up a proposal to mhada offering it road tdr in exchange for slum tdr for these two projects. strangely, in the proposal letter, romell does not mention the area in which it had road tdr. at express speed, mhada wrote to the bmc on the very same day, asking it to send it the list of properties in the city which have road tdr. four days later, on september 4, the bmc submitted a list of such properties, which included the vijaynagar housing society in anik. the bmc's list, however, did not contain the name of romell as one of the parties holding road tdr. on september 5, romell gave mhada just five days to accept its proposal. mhada agreed, without even asking romell in which part of the city it had road tdr. romell then entered into an agreement with the vijaynagar housing society to sell its road tdr to mhada. the question that was raised was: why did mhada not buy the cheap road tdr directly from the vijaynagar society instead of entering into an agreement with a middleman? under pressure from the government, mhada finally called off the deal and decided to advertise for buying road tdr. however, it was alleged that holders of road tdr formed a cartel and jacked up the rates of this commodity after mhada publicly announced that it wanted to purchase road tdr at a rate of rs 250 a sq ft. as a result, the housing board got offers for road tdr at a staggering rate of rs 400 a sq ft.

19,"It's all up to the govt. now, says Jog","mumbai: much like the project it self, madhav jog's touted `test drive' on the andheri flyover on wednesday turned out to be a rather slow and bumpy ride. on december 5, the deadline for completing the flyover, journalists were taken across the flyover. but the rough ashpalting, occasional bumps and scores of workers still labouring on the just concretised section c showed that while the bridge was ``structurally ready'' it was far from usable. so when will the flyover be ready, really and truly? mr jog won't set a deadline this time. ``it is all up to the government now, '' he says. ``ninety-seven per cent of the work is done. all that remains is a week's work of asphalting and finishing, while curing of the concrete will take two weeks,'' mr jog said. `if the government wants, it can speed this up by sanctioning rs 5 lakhs for high-speed curing,'' he added. the public works department has already rejected this proposal. it was a self-assured, slightly belligerent mr jog who spoke to the press on wednesday, blaming everyone but himself for the delay in completing the flyover. ``instead of looking at the delay of a few days in finishing it, you should look at the 24-month delay.'' mr jog blames the delay on the public interest litigation which was filed against the project in november 1999, but also on the government for late payments. ``the government still owes me rs 25 crore for the additional work commissioned by the pwd, which was supposed to have been paid by september,'' he said. ``which contractor works before being paid? i could have stopped work but in the interests of the public i am finishing the flyover without being paid.'' on the other hand, he points out, his source of financing __ the sale of commercial space under the flyover __ was scuppered by the pil which had challenged the commercial use of that space. ``the nature and the structure of the project have changed from a build-operate-transport project to a part regular works contract,'' he said. ``and technically, i can claim time upto may 2002, given the clauses in the indian contract act.'' the act makes allowances for delays which are due to ``extraneous factors''. ``as a contractor i have my responsibilites but i also have my rights,'' he asserted, accusing the media of distorting the picture. ``i must thank the press for giving so much coverage. it is a rs 175 crore project but the column inches it has generated is worth much more,'' he said caustically. indeed, it was an aggressive, sarcastic mr jog, staking ``his rights'', who took on old and new allegations over the controversy-mired flyover head on, and without prompting. * on allegations that he instigated the pil himself: ``that's an interesting proposition. am i that big a fool to initiate a case against myself after already investing rs 65 crore on the project.'' * on rumours that he prolonged construction deliberately: ``jog must be stupid or a bloody fool to do that. of the three components of the bridge, the subways and the commercial space, i am only interested in the last which i can only profit from once the other two are complete.'' * on this being the most expensive flyover, at rs 110 crore: ``in the original project, the government would only spend rs 9 crore since i would sell space to finance it. in addition, it had six lanes, nine ground lanes, three subways and 1.5 lakh square feet of parking space.'' mr jog also revealed that the cost of the project had gone up from rs 110 crore to rs 175 crore, with rs 40 crore being the interest on finance during the period of work suspension and rs 25 crore incurred on extra work commissioned by the pwd. * on whether the project has damaged his reputation: ``my credentials are impeccable. my firm completes 50 next year and one bridge does not make any difference to my prospects.'' box: after the 'over, the subways in the next chapter of the saga of the andheri flyover, the fate of three subways hang in the balance. the subways, which will be at hanuman nagar, sahar junction and andheri-kurla junction, will ease pedestrian crossing on these roads as well as help vehicular traffic heading into the commercial centre under the flyover. but, according to mr jog, permissions have only been received for one subway at hanuman nagar. ``although we have sent the papers for the other two six months ago, we have not yet got the clearance,'' he said. ``and the commercial development cannot commence till the subways are completed.'' the deadline for finishing the subways is march 31, 2002.
