3,Power minister supports CESC's act,"kolkata: west bengal power minister mrinal banerjee on friday supported the cesc's 'right' to collect arrears of enhanced tariff from consumers. claiming that the state government had nothing to do with the increase in the power bill increases, he asked the opposition to approch the high court against the tariff revision recommended by the state electricity regularity commission, a quasi-judicial body. he was speaking in the state assembly in response against a non-official motion tabled by the suci member debaprasad sarkar opposing the tariff hike and accusing the government of taking the brief of the cesc, on friday. ""the state goverment has opposed the cesc on budge budge power station case and i have reservations against them. it was the serc which allowed cesc to hike tariff, not the state government. the company has the right to collect the arrear. on the other hand, the state electricity board as well as dpl have been asked to lower their tariff. we have to comply with that,'' maintained the minister. both the trinamul congress and congress supported suci and criticised the government for 'heaping the burden' of huge power bill on the poor and the middle class consumers, including small traders. the entire opposition voted together on the motion on the last day of the winter session. the motion was defeated. meanwhile, all bengal electricity consumers association has ugred the voters to boycott the payment of cesc bills from january. the serc has allowed the company to collect the arrears of the electricity bills for the current financial year. the company is likely to start the collection from january in four or five installment. the opposition members felt the resultant staggering figure of the bills would be unbearable for many a smal consumers. sarkar charged the lf government with practising double standards as the left opposed the central power bill while enforcing the same provisions of 'power sector reforms'. he said that reform formula wanted to stop the pratice of providing cross subsidy to the agriculture and urban middle class at the expense of big industry. ""the lf govt is not just copying the policy but also empowered the electricity companies with with draconian powers to harass and intimidate common consumers. if you are no party to the serc decision, why don't you move to court as a committed government,'' he said referring to the recently passed bill in the assembly empowering the state to raise a power sector police force and making provision for jail term for five years in case of conviction in power theft case. opposition leader pankaj banerjee said that former power minister sankar sen had to resign as he clashed against the politically well connected cesc group. he pointed out the common consumers would be most hurt.

4,Quick-fill potholes do not enthuse govt,"pune: you must have often wondered why potholes never get filled up in the city, why new roads wear out rapidly and why bridges collapse well before their time or are frequently closed for maintenance. while corruption which encourages poor quality of construction is almost synonymous with public civil work, manufacturers and dealers of construction equipment say that government departments are not in tune with the latest in construction equipment. at the ongoing constro 2001 exhibition at the college of engineering grounds at shivajinagar, a sophisticated array of heavy construction machinery is on display. but, say manufacturers and dealers, the response from government departments and the public sector to modern construction equipment has been lukewarm as compared to private entrepreneurs. take this contraption for filling potholes, called the 'pit filling trough', which fills potholes in roads more efficiently and faster than the laborious manual method currently in use. considering the fact that potholes are the bane of every puneite, it is surprising when ragesh nair of universal sales corporation the manufacturer says, there has been no response for this equipment from any of the government agencies so far. the rs 4.5 lakh machine has a compressor to clean the pits before filling it up with metal and tar. nair said the company, which has tie-ups with german-based knig krane for tower cranes and triax srl from italy for bar cutting machines, desig-ned the trough rider keeping in view the bad condition of city roads. tower cranes, spray plastering machines, trenchers and horizontal directional drilling equipment, to name just some of the impressive machinery on display, could all give a far better output than what is currently in use. for example, scavenger trenchers and horizontal directional drilling machines are used for laying underground cables without digging up the roads - something citizens of any indian city would love to witness. but, says shiv n. mathur of the manufacturers bharat underground and environmental equipment company, the demand has come mostly from private parties for the equipment which just requires making two holes at both ends of the road. in a country - and city - with acute water shortages, you would think godrej and boyce mfg. co. ltd's recently designed wastewater management system would find interested government parties flocking to try it out. not so. there is an acute shortage of water in most parts of the city and with so many new constructions coming up in and around pune, our water recycling mechanism has great potential. our product is easily adaptable to nutrient removal; there is no need for external clarifiers and it is better resistant to sludge bulking since the biomass undergoes cyclic feast-famine conditions, explained dr s.p. sivanand, senior manager (environment) of the company. however, the public response to the event has been overwhelming. the big crowd pullers are the heavy machinery, like the vacuum dewatering system, and the virtual sky bus metro displayed by the konkan railway corporation ltd, which the pmc is contemplating using in the city.

5,Pasla defied party: Surjit,"garhshankar, hoshiarpur: with cpm general secretary harkishen singh surjeet ruling out possibility of rapprochement with the dissident faction led by mangat ram pasla, the division in the party's state unit seems inevitable. it would be formalised after both the factions declare their respective state committees and state secretaries within a day or two. talking to mediapersons here on friday, surjeet blamed pasla for defying party policies and raising a banner of revolt at the instance chief minister parkash singh badal. surjeet was here to inaugurate the three-day session of the state unit even as the pasla faction concluded its parallel two-day session in jalandhar on friday. dismissing pasla's attempt to split the party as futile, surjeet said the party would go from strength to strength while detractors would bite the dust. commenting on reports that merely four of 15 politburo members had put their stamp on pasla's expulsion, surjeet said it was a unanimous decision in which all members were consulted even if they did not participate in the meeting. surjeet, who was accompanied by two other politburo members, prakash karat and s r pillay, admitted that both, he and pasla, also differed vis-a-vis tie-ups with other political parties like the congress, bjp and akali dal. he said in no condition was he prepared to have truck with communal forces represented by the bjp and the akali dal. and as this viewpoint did not go well with pasla, it exacerbated their differences. on reaching electoral understanding with the congress in the coming vidhan sabha elections here, surjeet remained non-committal. he, however, ruled out forming an alliance or a front with the congress, but indicated that they could have a tacit understanding. as for an alliance with the state cpi unit, he said proposals couldn't materialise as the cpi has been holding talks with the congress ""without consulting us"". earlier, addressing an impressive public rally at the grain market here, the cpm leader condemned the centre for its ""unpardonable security lapse"" reflected in the militant attack on parliament. he said prime minister atal behari vajpayee and home minister l k advani had publicly admitted to knowledge about a possible attack by militants, yet no effective preventive measures were taken. he also wondered if the poto could be effective in checking such incidents. demanding immediate abrogation of it, he said the poto, in fact, might help militants in the long run.

6,Main conspirator in Shirole murder case arrested,"pune: the deccan police have arrested the man they believe to be the main conspirator in the murder of lawyer trymbak shirole. estate agent kailas kadam was picked up by the police in kharlewadi near pimpri on thursday night. it may be recalled that mr shirole was murdered in broad daylight on bhandarkar road on november 5.a dispute over some real estate owned by him at pimple-nilakh was believed to be the cause. the police had arrested one of the assailants, nilesh sutar, as he was fleeing the murder scene. subsequently two others believed to have murderously assaulted mr shirole, gautam chikotikar and sanjay sutar, were arrested. all three assailants are residents of belgum in karnataka. during the course of the investigation, police discovered that a family by the name of kashid had tenancy rights over shirole's land and a civil dispute was ongoing between the kashids and the shiroles for the past few years. in 1999, the kashids gave their power-of-attorney to estate agents sarjerao deshmukh, hambirrao patil and sadguru kadam, who is the brother of kailas kadam. the three were authorised to undertake any deals on this land on the kashids' behalf. last year, the three power-of-attorney holders found a buyer who, however, demanded a no-objection certificate (noc) from the owner of the land before completing any deal. the police say that by now, kailas kadam had managed to get the earlier power-of-attorney cancelled and a new one assigned to him alone. when mr shirole, the owner of the land, was not ready to give the noc, the police allege that kailas kadam twice tried to murder him, once in february and again in july this year. mr shirole survived both attempts. finally, a thug from kolhapur named pradip chavan was hired by kailas kadam to carry out the murder of mr shirole for rs 5 lakh. and it was he who, with the help of his three henchman murdered mr shirole on november 5, according to the police. the police have also arrested those suspected of the two earlier attempts on mr shirole's life. senior inspector of the deccan police station p.u.kohinkar is investigating the case.

8,'Army asked govt to hit PoK terror camps',"new delhi: the military leadership had advised the government in october this year, as operation enduring freedom was under in afghanistan, to go militarily pro-active and hit terrorist bases and camps inside pakistan occupied kashmir, claims a just published book. ""it was not not enough for the government to give evidence of the jaish-osama-taliban nexus to the united states"", the military argued saying while the united states hit terrorist bases in afghanistan, the indian military should do so in pok, says the book authored by soldier-turned journalist pravin sawhney. this was not not the first time, when political leadership discarded military advise for decisive action on the kashmir issue and on american advise, lost yet another opportunity to checkmate islamabad by putting military pressure on it, said the book the defence makeover, 10 myths that shape india's image. the book says it was the same story in 1993, when the late army chief b c joshi had advised the p v narasimha rao government to hit terrorists bases in pok. these lost opportunities, the book claims, would result in kashmir continuing to burn in the coming days ahead with the army remaining under relentless pressure. the author contends that pakistan will not not start an all out conventional war with india, unless provoked by the latter and should a conflict break out, it would not not be easy for india to defeat pakistan, because both sides were matched at the operational level of war. the book says both sides, moreover, will be hesitant to employ nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles even with conventional warheads which explains why the two belligerent neighbours should welcome a ""missile stabilisation regiment and setting up of a ""nuclear risk reduction centre"" regarding kashmir, the author says that counter-insurgency operations have become the primary task of the indian army and in the absence of a genuine political process the unabated mayhem can prove disastrous. the book counsels that unless new delhi buys internal peace, the simla agreement will remain defunct, pakistan will continue to support insurgency, and the siachen war will not end. the book infers that the siachen war which was started by india was politically necessary but bungled by the military leadership. on nuclear tests, the book argues that india's security has been compromised. ""india calls itself a nuclear weapon state when its military is unaware of the nation's nuclear weapon capabilities and is not in the policy making loop. the book argues that this can be done best by the creation of a chief of defence staff post. pakistan, on the other hand, leads india in nuclear weaponisation and in having better ballistic missiles because the needed employment, deployment and declaratory policies are firmly under the control of the pakistan army.

13,Revised Singatalur Project won't help farmers: Expert,"bellary: v.s. malleemath, retired chief justice of karnataka high court, said here on saturday that the government must think about farmers' welfare when it formulates irrigation projects. malleemath was speaking after inaugurating a seminar on `singatalur yetha neeravari-saadhaka baadhakagalu' organised by the district janata dal (united) as part of m.p. prakash abhinandana samarambha at basava bhavana here. ``irrigation projects must be completed in time so that it does not affect the progress of a region and the farmers' interests'', he added. citing the cauvery dispute as an example, he added, the delay in completion of certain projects in the cauvery belt had halted work on projects such as hemavathi, kabini and so on. ``the delay was only because the projects were not executed in time'', he added. k.m. rudraswamy, retired chief engineer, pwd, who is also a technical advisor for the tungabhadra jalasadhana samithi, said, ``the karnataka government seems to have overlloked the fact that while executing the revised comprehensive singatalur lift irrigation project (slip) over 5 tmc ft is being released into andhra.'' he added that out of 212 tmc ft of water in the reservoir, the tb board had fixed karnataka's share (139 tmc ft) and andhra's share (73 tmc ft) every year. since the deposit of silt in the reservoir was unchecked, the storage of the reservoir came down to 103 tmc ft, he added. also, about 40-42 tmc ft of water was unutilised, he said. ``the karnataka government's main concern should be how to tap this unused 42 tmc ft of water by envisaging projects in the krishna basin'', he added. rudra swamy said, ``water in the tb reservoir is not enough to supply water to perennial crops such as sugarcane. also, the government had made several provisions to mega industries and allotted 3-4 tmcft of water for their use.things have come to such a point that it has become difficult to supply water in the rabi season to farmers.'' the formulation of slip will make things worse and reduce the water level by 5 tmc ft. water will also be demanded by farmers in the andhra region as according to slip, an additional 11 tmc ft of water has to be diverted, he added. darur pullaiah, president of the tungabhadra jalasadhana samithi, who is spearheading the movement against the revised slip irrigation project, said the main demand of farmers' in this region is an alternative arrangement to store water. if the construction of projects such as slip is done without a thought, it would not benefit any region, he added. former legislative council member n.thippanna, former legislator and vice-president of tungabhadra jalasadhan samithi c.m.revana siddaiah also spoke. rural development minister m.y.ghorpade who was scheduled to inaugurate the seminar, the main speaker captain rajarao, retired secretary, ministry of irrigation, and all congress representatives were conspicuous by their absence.

""for placing the bahujan samaj party on the top slot, it should be number one party in 10 to 12 states,"" he said. he said that a look into growth of congress, bjp and the communists showed that these parties took around fifty to seventy years to reach the position of eminence. but the bahujan samaj party, he said, captured the third slot in ten years. in 1996, the election commission declared it a national party which was a unique feat, ram said adding, now the thrust would be to make it a ""hukamrano ki party (rulers party)"". on coming assembly polls in some states, the bsp supremo said that in punjab his party would make a serious bid to capture power. on performance of the nda government, the bsp president said that it was like a cart being pulled by many horses in different directions. ram asked the assembled crowd to continue their fight against the `manuvadi' system with all sincerity of purpose and said in his absence mayawati would lead them. profusely praising mayawati, the bsp supremo said: ""mayawati's achievement during her chief ministership was tremendous. what she did in six months was equal to five years work."" ram said mayawati never wavered in her mission and worked for the cause of the bahujan samaj with complete dedication. mayawati in her 45-minute speech set the agenda for party workers. she began her speech by reminding the gathering how the congress party had tried to sabotage ambedkar's entry into the constituent assembly. mayawati continuously referred to gandhi and nehru. she held these leaders responsible for the plight of dalits and said had the britishers not been there, ambedkar would not have been able to stay in the constituent assembly. then she came down to mulayam, holding him solely responsible for the survival of the bjp government. she said the bjp leaders had bowed before kanshi ram to seek his support for the rotational chief ministership. she said once bjp assumed power, it rescinded all decisions taken for helping the dalits. ""but we paid back by voting out the vajpayee government at the time of vote of confidence at the centre"", she said asking the bsp workers to teach them a lesson at the time of elections. on attack on parliament, she said the central government should quit owing the responsibility for its failure to protect the epitome of democracy.
