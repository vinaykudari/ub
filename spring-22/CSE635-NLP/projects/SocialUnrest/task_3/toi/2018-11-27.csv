""the programme is designed to equip field functionaries to change the approach of a particular cluster to eliminate mistrust and negative competition inside the cluster to ensure better results,"" das said. citing the case of a floor rug-making cluster in tonk district of rajasthan, she said, ""the intervention of cda changed the mind-set of the cluster, thereby increasing its productivity. the cluster was able to fetch an export order of rs 3.5 lakh, which was not possible for any individual artisan of the same cluster."" ""the concept has proved helpful in building local capabilities, competence building, public-private partnerships, skill upgradation, technological development and a host of other aspects necessary for the growth of a cluster,"" said mukesh gulati, focal point manager, unido cluster programme. the cluster development programme which started in italy in 1970 against a large investment model was later followed by many developed nations. unido replicated the cluster development programme in latin american countries in 1993, while the concept came to india in 1996. there are an estimated 350 modern sses and 2,000 rural and artisan-based clusters in india contributing up to 60 per cent of the country's manufactured exports.

8,Vasai polls will witness bitter fight,"mumbai: after a gap of almost 29 years, the congress will once again enter the troubled waters of vasai municipal council. in the forthcoming civic elections, the party will put up candidates using its symbol. the last time the party fought election in this historic municipal council, which is one of the oldest councils in the country set up in 1856, was way back in 1972. after that, the then congress leader from the district, bhausaheb vartak, and advocate j.s. rajani set up the vasai shahar sudharak mandal. the congress suffered another blow in this region in 1999, when the breakaway nationalist congress party was set up in 1999. this time, the mpcc has fielded candidates by using its party symbol and appointed youth congress president muzaffar hussein as the incharge of the polls. although ncp and the shiv sena-bjp alliance is in the fray, the real fight will be between the congress party and the vasai vikas mandal, which was set up by independent mla hitendra thakur. the vasai vikas mandal is fighting elections in nalasopara, virar, manik-navghar municipal councils and controls these local bodies. as these areas are considered the fastest urban development in the region, the fight for controlling these local self-government bodies has intensified in recent times. the congress has put up former municipal council president michel futardo, while the vasai vikas mandal has put up sitting council president ajay kokani. deepak gavankar is sena-bjp candidate. although the ncp fielded 22 candidates, five candidates were disqualified and seven withdrew from the contest. in jalgaon, the shiv sena is facing problems as the sena mla and former minister suresh jain has put up a separate front for the jalgaon council elections. meanwhile, bjp stalwart and former minister eknath khadse took strong objection to the front and the sena leadership has sent mlc arvind sawant to take stock of the situation. he has asked the sena candidates to withdraw from the vikas aghadi set up by mr jain.

10,"Govt, Oppn fail to resolve terror law issue","new delhi: the government will now try to resolve the difference between it and the opposition on the prevention of terrorism ordinance (poto) at an all-party meeting to be convened by the prime minister vajpayee as the home ministry consultative committee on monday failed to enlist opposition support on the terror law, for the second time. government sources on monday admitted that the stand-off continued but they insisted that by and large the opposition too agreed to the necessity of having such a law against terrorism. home minister advani, chairing the meeting, assured the mps opposed to the poto that the government would not bring the bill into parliament until the prime minister holds an all-party meeting on it. he said the pm wanted the all-party meeting to discuss the subject threadbare, in a bid to evolve a consensus on it. advani did not say when the meeting would be held. he said the government had heard views of the opposition and a final decision on poto would be taken after the prime minister consulted all parties. during the 90-minute meeting, congress leaders shivraj patil and ghulam nabi azad opposed poto in its present form, bjp leader madan lal khurana told journalists later. khurana said the congress, however, maintained that there was a need for a law to combat terrorism. he also indicated the government was open to amending certain provisions of poto, including those affecting the freedom of the press. communist party of india (marxist) leader somnath chatterjee, on the other hand, said ""lines are drawn"" and his party would continue to express its reservation against poto. muslim league member g m banatwala along with samajwadi party members strongly opposed the ordinance. the congress said there was no change in its stand on poto. ""there is no dilution or change in our stand on poto. we have strong reservations about poto. any anti-terror law can be considered only after wide-ranging consultations with political parties and the states,"" party spokesman anand sharma said. he said if the government was so serious about bringing in such a legislation why it went for the ordinance just two weeks before the commencement of the current session. sharma said the bjp was trying to mislead the people that the congress had diluted its stand on poto.

13,Monks lock horns with RJD govt,"gaya: the bodh gaya monks and the rabri devi government are heading for a showdown on the issue of the appointment of kalicharan yadav, a laloo loyalist, as the secretary of the mahabodhi temple management committee, the most sacred buddhist shrine. kalicharan replaced bhadant prajyasheel, a monk, who was somewhat unceremoniously shown the door to install kalicharan yadav as the secretary of the buddhist shrine. all india monk association president bhadant surai sasai and general secretary bhadant anand have already served an ultimatum to meet its three-point charter of demands or be prepared to face agitation by the monks. besides demanding the immediate dissolution of the temple management committee having kalicharan yadav as secretary, the monks have also reiterated their long pending demand for the amendment of the temple management committee act, 1949, to facilitate the transfer of shrine management to an all buddhist committee. the third demand of the monks pertained to the repair of the shrine which is showing alarming signs of decay due to poor maintenance and almost criminal violation of the guidelines for the upkeep of protected monuments. the archaeological survey of india is to carry out the repair work. cracks have surfaced and the indiscreet electrical fittings and nail insertions have further caused damage to the shrine visited by a large number of pilgrims and tourists from different parts of the world. in the joint representation addressed to the bihar chief minister rabri devi, the monks have pointed out that whereas the shrine is managed by the donations made mostly in foreign exchange by buddha followers from different parts of the world, the bihar government has done great injustice by installing a non- buddhist as the shrine secretary. the temple belonged to the buddhists and they will continue to fight for the fulfillment of their long pending demand. though, agitation by the buddhists for the dissolution of the temple management committee and amendment of the temple management act in itself would not be an earth shaking event, it is bound to cause immense embarrassment to the state government on account of its impact on the growth of the tourist sector and the perceived injustice being done to the followers of a faith which has been fast gaining acceptability in the west. the ultimatum given to the state government does not carry a time frame for the fulfilment of their demand for the dissolution of the shrine management committee. however, the agitation may begin sooner than apprehended, may be it is made to coincide with the birth anniversary of bhim rao ambedkar, on december 6. the monks, in the representation made to the chief minister, have also put the blame on the bihar government for sabotaging the initiative of the former union home minister for an amicable and negotiated settlement of the vexed issue of shrine management. if signals emanating from the state government sources are any indication, the rabri devi government is not inclined to oblige the monks either by dissolving the shrine committee or appointing a buddhist as secretary in place of kalicharan yadav. both the sides seem to be itching for a confrontation which is likely to further malign the state in the eyes of buddha followers.

14,MCC-PW bandh call evokes mixed response,"patna: the 12-hour dawn to dusk bihar bandh jointly sponsored by the maoist communist centre (mcc) and people's war (pw) to protest the us attack on afghanistan failed to evoke any response in the state on monday. no untoward incident has been reported from any district. special vigil was maintained in mcc-pw dominated areas and police personnel were deployed at all sensitive locations, including near railway tracks. earlier, the security alert was sounded throughout the areas considered mcc stronghold in parts of jehanabad, aurangabad, gaya, sasaram and bhojpur to deal with the situation if extremists resorted to violence to enforce the bandh call, according to official sources. road traffic in the district came to a near halt in view of the bihar and jharkhand bandh sponsored by the mcc and the cpi ml (pw). reports reaching the divisional headquarters at gaya say that even the grand trunk road wore an almost deserted look as the transporters went off the roads fearing naxalite attack. the bus passengers had to face great inconvenience as the buses did not ply on all the important routes, including the gaya-patna, gaya-tekari and gaya-sherghati route. long distance buses too did not ply on monday. however, the bandh did not affect movement of trains and rail traffic on the grand chord section and the patna-gaya section was reported to be normal till the time of reporting. apart from throwing road traffic out of gear, the bandh did not affect other spheres of life and most of the shops in the sub divisional head quarters of tekari, sherghati and bathani opened as usual. in an incident of arson, bandh supporters put a truck on fire in village gulariachak of the tekari police station area on monday morning. only partial damage was caused to the truck as police force rushed to the village and the miscreants fled the scene. the jharkhand bandh call given by the mcc failed to evoke any response in dhanbad. the divisional railway manager (drm), dhanbad, ak vohra said there was no report of disruption in rail services and blockade of rail tracks from any part of his division. he said bandh supporters had blocked railway tracks at hindgir near patratu in dhanbad division but it was cleared immediately. the bandh, however, had a massive impact in bagodar area of the adjoining giridih district. according to reports reaching dhanbad, the extremists kidnapped a commander jeep and shot dead the driver vishwanath rai. the divisional railway manager (drm), dhanbad, ak vohra said there was no report of disruption in rail services and blockade of rail tracks from any part of his division. he said bandh supporters had blocked railway tracks at hindgir near patratu in dhanbad division but it was cleared immediately. the mcc-sponsored bandh call on monday had its maximum impact in girdih district of jharkhand where two people were killed and another injured in exchange of fire between the former and the police. a truck carrying hay was also torched near bagodar in the district. no one was however injured in the fire. in another related incident the mcc set fire to two engine tower wagons between tori and chetar railway stations in hazaribagh district. though the mcc also opened fire here nobody was reported injured and the fire was also brought under control soon. another truck was set afire on nh 33 at mandu near the charhi outpost in hazaribagh district at 2.30 am where the outfit had set up a road blockade.

15,Only rich can win elections: MP,"new delhi: the government has no time-bound programme to implement the indrajit gupta committee report on state funding of political parties for elections. replying to a question in the rajya sabha on monday, law minister arun jaitley said the government will soon take a decision on the report and the process of consultation is in an ""advanced stage"". deviating from the academic debate, lachman singh of the congress pointed out that only the rich can win elections and the poor have no chance in the present electoral system. singh's supplementary evoked laughter from both the treasury as well as opposition members as he said he had contested many elections and if anybody employed honest means he would only lose. he pointed out the impracticality of several recommendations on state funding. apparently, most of the opposition members believed that the source of corruption in public life is the clout of money power in electoral politics. congress and samajwadi party members, while asking supplementaries, pointed out that politicians are being held to ransom by corporates and good political workers are being restrained from entering electoral politics because they lack money power. but despite repeated queries from the opposition, the minister declined to give a time-frame within which the union government would enact laws to change the way elections are funded in the country. in fact, karan singh of the congress asked the government whether it will bring in a law before the assembly elections that are just a few months away. the minister said it is not possible to give a time frame. the member who raised the question, balkavi bairagi of the congress, sought a ""full stop"" rather than evasive answers.

16,NCERT circular: Cong fumbles on govt's offensive,"new delhi: the congress found itself on the backfoot in the lok sabha on monday when it failed to make an effective case against the government regarding the ncert's circular deleting certain portions from history textbooks. in fact, when the issue was raised during zero hour, the congress was left fumbling for an adequate response when the treasury benches went on the offensive, justified these deletions and categorically rejected the opposition demand for the withdrawal of the controversial ncert circular. an assertive parliamentary affairs minister pramod mahajan asked the congress whether by asking for the withdrawal of the ncert circular it was seeking restoration of the objectionable reference to guru tegh bahadur and the jats in the school history books. the congress, whose government in delhi had ordered the deletion of the reference to guru tegh bahadur, was effectively silenced. it eventually took recourse to a walk-out after other opposition parties had already left the house to protest the government's stonewalling on the issue. during an hour-long discussion, aggressive treasury benches maintained the ncert had done nothing wrong, and mahajan asserted, ""we have not tampered with the books...we have not re-written the books... we have just deleted certain objectionable portions to restore the glory of guru tegh bahadur and the jat community. there is no question of withdrawal of the circular."" stating that the opposition had not given a single proof to justify its allegation, mahajan demanded to know whether schoolchildren should be taught that guru tegh bahadur was a ""murderer and rapist"" and that the jat community comprised plunderers. the bjp position was bolstered when former prime minister chandra shekhar supported the ncert circular. the congress' problems were further compounded when its deputy leader shivraj patil admitted that the congress government in rajasthan had deleted certain objectionable references about nehru and gandhi introduced by the previous bjp government. he then went on to say there was nothing wrong in deleting objectionable references in a book but ""there is a way of going about it"" and that the matter be left to experts and academics. the lack of the congress homework and floor coordination among the opposition parties showed up as they spoke in different voices. the issue was raised by cpm members suresh kurup and basudev acharia, who protested the deletion of certain portions in the history textbooks and charged that this was being done at the behest of the sangh parivar and there was no difference between the taliban and them. ""taliban and the sangh parivar are two sides of the same coin,"" kurup charged, adding that the bjp is destroying the country's secular fabric by tampering with the education system. they demanded the immediate withdrawal of the ncert circular. the issue also figured in the rajya sabha when opposition condemned ncert chief rajput's pronouncements and the re-writing of history text books. nilotpal basu of the cpm raised the issue immediately after the question hour. basu said the government was refusing to give out names of those who have re-written the history text books. referring to a newspaper report on rajput's press conference, basu accused the ncert chief of relying on an rss pamphlet and thus maintaining blatantly political and partisan views on the issue. though the opposition members had not sought permission from the chair to make a special mention, nilotpal basu told the chair that since it is an important issue and since the timing is important, he had to raise the issue immediately.

17,Laloo ‘yatra’ makes partymen euphoric,"ranchi: euphoria sweeps through the jharkhand unit of the rjd over the success of party supremo laloo prasad yadav's surrender yatra. the crowds' response in jharkhand was overwhelming. i have never considered jharkhand a separate state despite the bifurcation. this also is my own state. i will continue my public contact programmes in jharkhand in future, said laloo while talking to times news network on monday morning for about 15 minutes before he proceeded to surrender before the special court for cbi cases here. the rjd chief's night stay in ranchi on the eve of his surrender was at the russian hostel, which now serves as a guest house for mlas and mps visiting jharkhand. anyone familiar with the patna political scene would have mistaken the place for one located in bihar's capital instead of being in jharkhand's capital. almost all the bihar ministers, including ravindra charan yadav, shakuni choudhary, shivanand tiwari, baswan bhagat and sri narayan yadav, were present, not to forget sadhu and subhash yadav, the two high-profile brothers of bihar chief minister rabri devi. so were the usual hangers-on seen with them in patna. the jharkhand government has virtually become non-existent in ranchi, boasted an rjd minister from bihar. girinath singh, leader of the nine-member rjd group in the jharkhand assembly, was among a few faces from outside bihar recognisable in the crowd. lalooji's visit is a great boost for us here. the people perceive him as their saviour from the discredited marandi government, said girinath while insisting that not a single minister or senior official of jharkhand dared to meet laloo even for the sake of formality due to a sense of guilt. even in undivided bihar, the jharkhand area having 83 assembly seats was considered to be a weak spot of the rjd. even in the days when laloo's popularity was at its peak and his party used to sweep north and central bihar, it got third or even fourth place in polls in the then south bihar. its influence was largely confined to districts like palamu and koderma. that's because the party never fought the elections here independently. we were always tagged with other parties like the jmm or congress. but now this party is going to grow, said girinath. the truth is that the mega carcade of laloo drew thinner crowds in jharkhand than in bihar. after koderma, the people of hazaribagh and ramgarh largely ignored the carcade. there were, however, large gatherings in koderma and barhi. there is something about laloo which no leader in jharkhand has, said maula singh, who runs an std booth in koderma, as he saw laloo lashing out at the marandi government from his air-conditioned garib chetna rath. laloo is a kalakar (a showman) and charismatic leader but his 'yatra' will not have any lasting effect on the politics of jharkhand. no matter how badly the marandi government rules, stated alok kumar dubey, an nsui activist of ranchi. surprisingly, rjd allies like the congress and jmm showed no enthusiasm for greeting laloo in jharkhand. the jharkhand unit of the congress remained neutral even though a large number of bihar congressmen accompanied laloo to ranchi. jharkhand congressmen resented the terror created by laloo's mega carcade. on monday, commercial establishments in the main road area of ranchi remained closed not due to the bandh call given by the naxalite outfit mcc but because of laloo supporters storming across the city in their sumos and balleros. you would have found innumerable ministers crossing the main road in their ambassadors equipped with red beacon light a dozen time. today, they have vanished, said a businessman.

18,Dropped ministers seek reasons for facing axe,"hyderabad:the reconstitution of the state cabinet appears to have left unanswered questions among the dropped lot of ministers, with most of them unable to understand why they have had to face the axe. most of the eight ministers dropped feel there was no need for a four-day exercise to reconstitute the cabinet. in fact, such a long exercise was an error of judgment on the part of the leadership, as it gave greater scope for dissension among partymen, they feel. according to former minister for tourism and sugar e peddi reddy, the exercise does not appear to have yielded the desired results. on the other hand, it has left some of them feeling hurt, as they have not been provided with any valid reason. peddi reddy said on monday he was still at a loss to understand why he was dropped.the performance indicators of the department of tourism have been rated high by the chief minister.there are no cases of corruption against me. i have taken the turnover of the tourism corporation from rs 2.25 crore to rs 20 crore in the past two years. the corporation, which was listed to be wound up, has been revived and is now making profits,'' he said. my district has bagged the award in family planning. i am still bewildered as to why i have been dropped,'' he added. the chief minister, according to reddy, said you are like my family member, we have been working together for 20 years.there were certain political compulsions''. reddy feels he deserves a clear answer. another former minister alapati rajendra prasad feels their removal from the cabinet without assigning any reason, at least orally, would cause embarrassment in their constituencies.we need to explain to our cadre,'' he said. k pushpaleela, another dropped minister, also feels this amounts to character assassination. the only minister who took the reconstitution in a spirited manner was former minister for information n sivaprasad. he said he had no regrets or complaints.

""i expect a broad-based rally led by old economy majors to take sensex upto 4,800 points level within next three months if there is no external impact. this is quite possible because when the market rebounds from low levels, it generally tends to seek higher levels,"" he said. the top gainers at the bombay stock exchange included zee tele (rs 139, up 4.67%), sbi (rs 215.50, up 4.46%), acc (rs 161.75, up 3.82%), reliance petroleum (rs 35.30, up 2.92%) and grasim (rs 290.95, up 2.52%). the main losers were satyam computers (rs 211.65, down 5.53%), m&m (rs 84.50, down 4.84%), colgate (rs 162, down 4.65%), infosys (rs 3,755.25, down 3.96%) and mtnl (rs 140, down 3.55%). after an overnight surge, the nasdaq had closed 31.48 points higher at 1934.68 points on monday while dow closed 19.45 points up at 9979.16.

24,Parliament extends President's rule in Manipur,"new delhi: the government on tuesday said it desired to hold assembly polls in manipur in february-march next year along with assembly elections in up, punjab and uttaranchal as parliament approved extension of president's rule in the state for another six months. home minister l k advani said in the rajya sabha though the government wanted to hold the manipur polls along with the three other states, a decision in this regard would have to be taken by the election commission. the rajya sabha later adopted the statutory resolution, already passed by the lok sabha on november 20, seeking extension of president's rule in manipur for another six months effective from december 2, 2001. winding up the discussion on manipur, which had recently witnessed political turmoil because of frequent defection of mlas, advani said he agreed with the members that there was an urgent need to have a ""re-look"" at the anti-defection law. reacting to congress member c apok jamir's suggestion that the anti-defection law should be reconsidered in the context of what had happened in manipur, the home minister said it was strange that while ""wholesale defection"" of mlas is allowed, the ""retail defection"" of legislators is not permissible. advani said there was need to arrive at a consensus for limiting the size of council of ministers not only in manipur but all over the country. he said when the delhi government was formed it was decided by the centre that it should not have more than seven ministers. this limit, he said, had ensured the stability of the government and created a healthy precedent. the home minister said this formula should be applicable in all states for political stability. intervening in the discussion, minister for north-east arun shourie said ""there can be no question about the need to instal a popular government in manipur, but we must realise that the situation there is more grave than being perceived."" he said the poor fiscal health of manipur could be gauged from the fact that its non-plan expenditure had doubled in five years and almost all the rs 500 crore plan expenditure was being diverted to pay salaries. shourie said rs 48,000 crore had been transferred to north-east states from central coffers till date but the fiscal health of the states was poor due to several inherent problems in the region.

32,"Amidst protests, AI pulls down hoardings","mumbai: a few days after air-india (ai) put up hoardings across the city advertising its ""improved profitability"", it was forced to withdraw them on monday evening following protests from sections of the public and airline employees. it was, perhaps, one of those rare occasions when a hoarding was removed even before the canvas was dry. according to sources, the `improved profitability'' hoardings were removed after ai''s officiating managing director j.n. gogoi issued explicit instructions to this effect. under normal circumstances, a message on the hoarding lasts for three weeks. the new message on the hoarding was the brainchild of ai commercial director v.k. verma, ai sources told tnn on tuesday. when contacted, mr verma said that the hoardings were taken off because ""some people did not like it"". asked if he was responsible for the hoarding, he replied, ""it was the idea of the management and the advertising firm."" incidentally, the controversial hoarding had proclaimed, `improved bottomline. ai makes rs 12 crore profit in april-september 2001''. according to sources, the notice was a cause for embarrassment for the airline''s top brass since no corporate has ever highlighted its profitability and definitely not when the figure is not a landmark in its history using outdoor media. an ai official said, ""ai made a rs 1 crore profit daily in 1992-''93, but it was never publicised."" incidentally, even though ai has boasted of an ""improved bottomline"" in the controversial hoarding, the airline is currently in the red. ""its profitability has been wiped out mainly because of the steep fall in air travel following the terrorist strike in the u.s. on september 11,"" said the official. ""the rs 12 crore profit mentioned in the hoarding,"" he explained, ""was not an outcome of operational results because on two prime physical parameters load factor and the number of passengers carried between april and september 2001 the figures have been comparatively lower than in the previous year."" the load factor between april and september dropped by eight per cent and the number of passengers by two per cent. the load factor is defined as the percentage of seats occupied in a flight. according to ai sources, the airline''s revenue registered a modest increase only because the rupee depreciated vis-a-vis the dollar. ""there has been a big difference in the perception of ai''s financial performance between the commercial director and other members of the management team,"" they admitted. although the commercial director maintained during his media briefing that ai would end the financial year with a profit of rs 20 crore, the airline has already pressed the panic button and sought to contain costs in order to meet its daily financial needs. ai recently availed itself of a rs 100 crore loan from different banks to meet its working capital needs. the sources said this clearly established that the revenue was not in excess of expenditure which would be a ""must if the airline was making a profit"".

34,Cane farmers forced to sell produce to sick factory,"haveri: this year, sugarcane farmers are wary of bringing their produce to the karnataka cooperative sugar factory at sangur in haveri district. the factory is in the red. but the ban on export of cane to neighbouring states has forced the farmers to send their produce to this factory. the scenario has sparked off doubts among the farmers: will the factory pay up the dues of the previous years? how will the factory come out of its financial crisis? is there any guarantee of getting money for the sugarcane supplied this year? but these are questions unanswered by the factory management. despite this, the government has asked the factory management to crush sugarcane this year. crushing began on a dull note with farmers unwilling to risk their source of income for the next year. according to sources, the factory is yet to pay dues of rs 200 per tonne, amounting to rs 3.5 crore for 1999-2000. the factory does not have money to clear the dues, and the management has decided to ask the government for a loan of rs 2.24 crore. apart from this, the factory is yet to pay rs 50 per tonne as dues, amounting to rs 70 lakh for 1998-99. the farmers are bent upon getting back their dues first. but the factory management is mum over the issue. the factory has the capacity to crush 1,500-1,800 tonne of cane during the year. but the farmers, fed up with the management, have gone in for crop rotation and grown cane in limited areas. they are expected to supply only 1 lakh tonne of sugarcane to the factory. the new president of the factory, gurubasappa hanchinal, is confident of getting money from the government to clear its dues. ""i don't think a miracle will save us, but i am requesting the farmers to supply sugarcane immediately. it has been decided to pay rs 800 per tonne of sugarcane. out of this, farmers will get rs 300 per tonne immediately, rs 300 as the second instalment within 10 days and the remaining rs 200 will be paid within two months. i am confident of arranging payment for the sugarcane supplied this year.""
