0,Enthusiasm for polls missing in Baramulla,"BARAMULLA: In this militancy-dominated district of north Kashmir, voters are not only apprehensive of militant reprisals but are also largely disinterested in exercising their franchise due to ""repeated rigging in the past elections"", they say.

""All elections were rigged in the past. Besides all leaders who get elected never fulfil their promises,"" says Abdul Rashia a medicine shop owner in Patan town, 25 kms from Srinagar.

""We are not in favour of elections. We want azadi (independence),"" shouted a youth. As one goes from Srinagar to Baramulla, all the signs of elections are missing.

There are no election flags or banners, barring in some places. People are also not as enthusiastic as had been reported in newspapers earlier. When asked about this, local people say: ""There was a lot of enthusiasm initially, as people wanted to teach a lesson to the ruling party and they felt that voting them out of power would be the best way to do it. However, the killing of Hurriyat leader Abdul Ghani Lone, and some other fatal attacks by militants in this district has brought in the fear factor,"" said a local official. However, deputy commissioner Naveen Chowdhary discounts the fear factor in the minds of voters. He claims sufficient security measures have been taken to provide security to the electorate.

""The Army will provide security cover from outside in the whole constituency.

""The para-military forces will provide security in and around the polling booths.""

He said that the security forces will also be deployed in all vantage positions in villages, towns where polling booths would be located.

He also discounted the rigging factor, saying 50 per cent of the polling staff are from outside and local polling staff are deployed from different areas.

""There is the EVM system for voting. Identification of voters is easy. There is no question of rejection of votes due to EVMâ€™s,"" he added.

4,Samastipur bandh over trader's abduction,"SAMASTIPUR: Samastipur observed bandh on Saturday in protest against the abduction of one Umesh Kumar, a resident of Bengalitola locality of the town. Over 100 protesters were taken into custody during the bandh.

Umesh, an employee in the commercial department under the Samastipur railway division, has been missing since Tuesday morning.

However, the mystery behind the abduction deepened further when the nephew of the kidnapped lodged an FIR at the town police station on Thursday alleging that the divisional commercial manager had an indirect hand in the kidnapping.

Umesh is the brother of another railway employee, S N Rai, posted at Muktapur railway station as station master where a dacoity was committed in which armed criminals looted cash over Rs one lakh on September 2.

In the FIR lodged with the town police station by the nephew of Umesh, the names of an alleged criminal and a police constable have also been mentioned.

Meanwhile, sources said, great resentment prevails among the first class railway officers here over the mention of their colleagueâ€™s name in the FIR lodged in connection with the Umesh kidnapping case. They said that the officer was being implicated to misdirect the course of investigation into the dacoity case.

5,CM hints at scam in own govt,"KOLKATA: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on Friday stunned the Left Front by hinting at a major scam in his own government. At a Left Front committee meeting, Bhattacharjee raised the issue of the agricultural marketing department, headed by senior Forward Bloc minister Chhaya Ghosh, appointing 1,700 people to collect tax â€œworth croresâ€� on agricultural products in complete violation of rules.

There was no legal provision to collect such a tax, he declared, and went on to charge that the money being raised illegally was not being deposited in the treasury.

The charge against a Cabinet minister, brought by the CM himself, shocked Left Front leaders. Forward Bloc state secretary Ashok Ghosh was snubbed by the CM when he tried in vain to stop the CM. â€œWhy do you raise this issue here? You should discuss the issue with our party first,â€� he is quoted as saying.

The chief minister, however, reminded Ghosh that he had discussed the issue with him and the minister at least thrice during the past one year.

â€œI first brought this to your notice before the last Assembly elections. Though you said you would discuss the issue after the polls, you did not. Then I discussed it again with the minister.

â€œA few months ago, when a truck carrying jute was stopped at Uluberia and forced to pay the tax, I had again raised the issue,â€� the CM said. Chhaya Ghosh was not available for comment as she was unwell. But her party state secretary claimed that there was nothing illegal about the tax.

â€œThe money collected is being duly deposited in the government exchequer. What the chief minister said is not correct,â€� he said.

â€œThis tax is being collected by the agri-marketing department for 25 years. Had there been no legal provision, how could this continue for such a long time?â€� Ghosh asked and claimed the tax was being collected in accordance with the Regulated Markets Act.

The spat has left several questions unanswered.

The foremost being what or who stopped the CM from stopping the allegedly illegal practice on his own. The other being why he never raised the issue in Cabinet meetings.

6,TDP scales down attack on govt,"VIJAYAWADA: The city Telugu Desam Party unit on Saturday scaled down its attack on the state government on issues relating to the Vijayawada Municipal Corporation (VMC) and said it was not opposing the GOs as such and only trying to safeguard the interests of the people.

Addressing a press conference on Saturday evening, city TDP convenor K V P Basaveswara Rao said the party only suggested to the government that marriage halls in the city be handed over to private parties for maintenance on a â€˜no-loss, no-profitâ€™ basis.

â€œWe fear that the marriage halls will be out of the reach of the common people if they were totally privatised without any set conditions. Hence, we represented to the ministers to reconsider the issue in the interest of the people,â€� Basaveswara Rao said.

He said there was no clash between the mayor and TDP leaders on the issue.He, however, failed to spell out his partyâ€™s stand on the proposed sale of municipal shopping complexes.

Municipal commissioner Praveen Prakash placed the issue before the VMC council for a discussion on the merits and demerits involved. The opposition parties did not allow the council meeting to proceed smoothly forcing the mayor to suspend it till Monday.

Replying to a question, Basaveswara Rao confirmed that mayor P Anuradha sought a replacement for TDP floor leader V Dange Kumar but said she had not threatened to resign over the issue.

7,Naidu govt against more engineering seats,"HYDERABAD: The state has asked the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) to withdraw its proposal of granting 1,660 more engineering seats for this academic year.

The AICTE had sent the proposal to the state government during the last week of August. By the time the proposal was received, counselling for admissions into engineering courses had already begun. If the state government accepts the proposal, it would have to restart the exercise of counselling.

Hence the government is of the opinion that the additional seats be granted from the next year, according to official sources.

The sources said the government had conveyed to the AICTE its opposition to piece-meal sanctioning of additional seats and new engineering colleges after the process of admission was set in motion. The sources said it takes a minimum of 30 days for enrolling students under open category and 28 days for reserved categories.

Moreover, the department has to follow the reservation system. Under the system, 85 per cent of the seats have to be filled with local candidates and the rest with nonlocal candidates, besides implementing 33.3 per cent reservation for girls, the sources said.

In view of this, the government had returned the AICTEâ€™s midcourse sanctions.

Meanwhile, Adams Engineering College, Paloncha, filed a petition in the high court on the governmentâ€™s decision and the government also filed a caveat in the Supreme Court regarding this issue, a senior official said. A judgement is expected by the end of this month, the sources add.

8,Transco blames farmers for power crisis,"HYDERABAD: Even before monsoon is over, the state faces prospects of widespread power cuts. With the demand for electricity zooming to 145 million units (MU) a day from about 130 MU a day, the APTransco on Saturday held the farming community responsible for the shooting demand for power. The Transco stand comes even as farmers are facing the danger of losing their crops due to lack of irrigation. If the continued increase in demand from the farming sector is not controlled, Transco might be compelled to avail of load reliefs, a Transco statement, quoting its chairman-cummanaging director Rachel Chatterjee said. Transco said it had come to its notice that there was largescale use of phase converters to run pumpsets during single phase domestic power supply hours. The fact that the demand has shot up from 115 MU to 145 MU clearly indicates that the farmers were using power for more than nine hours a day, the company said. Rachel Chatterjee, who reviewed the power supply situation on Saturday, said that wrongful usage of power by using such devices is pushing up the demand aggravating the distress. She called on people to provide information on those using phase converters. The Transco statement said that the entire southern region was facing power shortages due to the shutting down of the 1,470 mega watt Neyveli power station on September 4. Moreover, the 340 MW Kalpakkam atomic power station was also closed for maintenance. The hydel power generation in the state has almost come to a standstill and some thermal units too have been shut for maintenance.

9,ONGC to fund investments from internal accruals,"KOLKATA: Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, a Navratna PSU, will fund all its investments mainly from internal accruals, its Chairman Subir Raha said on Saturday.

Speaking to reporters here, Raha said ONGC has lined up massive investments for the next five to seven years which would amount to Rs 10,000 crore.

He said the investments would be funded from internal accruals, adding, the corporation might raise money from the market also if needed.

""We will depend upon the government for support,"" Raha said. Raha said debt might also be raised to some extent.

One-third of the investments will be made in exploration, while the balance would be shared equally to fund development programmes and acquisitions, the ONGC chairman said.

He said the PSU plans to make overseas acquisitions for which the corporation was having dialogue with a number of countries.

ONGC has recently picked up ten per cent stake in a gas field in Louisiana, USA and substantial equity in two onshore exploration blocks in Libya, he said.

Raha said with the acquisition of AV Birla''s stake in MRPL, the refining capacity of ONGC would be 9.71 million tonnes per annum.

Discussions were going on to buy out HPCL''s stake in MRPL, he said.

The ONGC chief said the company would set up retail outlets on its own, for which substantial fund allocations would be made.

Raha said ONGC had already obtained marketing rights for transport fuel, adding, the company was seeking permission in the states of Karnataka, Kerala and Goa.

He said the company was making huge investments for development of oil fields by purchasing equipment.

10,Tata Group not to change views on disinvestment,"KOLKATA: Tata Group on Saturday said it would not change its views on disinvestment because of its experience with the government on the VSNL sale-off.

""Tata Group will continue to look at disinvestments in exactly the same way we have looked at it in recent times"", R Gopalakrishnan, executive director, Tata Sons said here on Saturday.

Scotching rumours that Tatas might try to get out of VSNL, one of its most publicised takeovers through the government''s disinvestment plan, the Tata Sons ED said, ""I cannot say that because of VSNL, Tatas will stop looking at the divestment process.""

Tata had a bitter stand-off with Union Information and Technology Minister Pramod Mahajan barely four months ago over VSNL''s decision to invest Rs 1200 crore in Tata Teleservices.

Gopalakrishnan, asserted on Saturday that the group was ''comfortable'' with VSNL and emphasised that telecom continued to be one of the thrust areas for future growth of the Tata Group.

The crisis took place only two months after government divested 25 per cent of its stake in the company to the Tatas.

The decision by the VSNL board to make a large investment in Tata Teleservices, another group company in the telecom sector, evoked strong reaction from Mahajan.

The matter was finally resolved after Deputy Prime Minister LK Advani intervened and the decision of the VSNL board was referred to a sub-committee for review.

Refusing to be drawn into controversy over the VSNL issue, Gopalakrishnan said the group was clear in its vision that telecom was one of the three thrust areas which the group identified for future growth, the other two being passenger cars and insurance.

He said the restructuring process in the group began about a decade ago and was still continuing. Currently the group was present in seven areas namely materials, energy, chemicals, engineering, IT and communications, consumer products and services.

Over the last 120 years, Gopalakrishnan said Tata Group was into 30 different business sectors with recent years being years of consolidation in fewer sectors and building of the Tata brand.

To a query he said that there was every likelihood that the group might decide to sell off some of its companies in the next five years but did not identify them.

He said that 85 to 90 per cent of the group''s total turnover came from only 12 companies and the remaining 60 to 65 companies contributed only 10 to 15 per cent of the turnover.

The Tatas, he said did not follow the logic of selling only loss-making companies and gave the example of Lakme and Goodlas Nerolac which were sold even though they were profit making ones.

""Selling only loss-making companies is a financial approach. We are not making any financial approach but we are looking at a strategic approach,"" he said, adding, ""companies may be profitable but you may sell it because it does not fit into your scheme of things"".

11,Stage set for first phase of J&K polls,"SRINAGAR: The stage is set for the first of the four-phased polling in J&K on Monday in 23 Assembly constituties, spread over five border districts of the state, amidst the tightest-ever security arrangements in view of recurrent attempts by militants to disrupt the poll process.

Leh district, which was to go to the polls in the first phase, has already returned two candidates for the 9th Assembly unopposed.

Security forces and police have taken positions well in advance in and around 2052 polling booths in Kupwara, Baramulla, Rajouri, Poonch and Kargil to instill confidence among the voters and to foil attempts by militants to disrupt the electoral process, officials said.

Almost all polling stations have been described as either hyper-sensitive or sensitive, they said.

An electorate of nearly 15 lakh will choose their 23 representives for the ninth Jammu and Kashmir Assembly on Monday in the most keenly-fought Assembly elections in the state''s chequered political history.

Their counterparts in 28 Assembly segments will register their choice on September 24 in the second phase, 27 Assembly constituencies in the third phase on October 1 and six segments of the militancy-infested Doda district in the fourth and final phase on October 8.

12,ONGC to move govt against British Gas,"NEW DELHI: The State-run Oil and Natural Gas Corporation will move government next week for intervention in its row with British Gas over management of Panna-Mukta and Tapti oil and gas field as the British oil and gas major has refused to share power with partners as previously agreed.

ONGC will write to the government, ahead of the September 30 deadline set by Petroleum Minister Ram Naik for arriving at a mutually acceptable model of joint operatorship of the field, complaining about the BG''s tactics of ""delaying"" arrival at a joint management structure, informed sources said here.

While ONGC, BG and Reliance Industries (the third partner) had in March agreed to jointly operate the offshore oil fields, there are differences among the Indian partners and the foreign investor on the structure of joint management.

Sources said BG has rejected the joint management model proposed by ONGC-RIL combine which suggested giving ONGC the Chief Operating Officer''s post while delegating Chief Operating Officer''s (COO) job to BG. RIL, as per the model, would have claim on the post of Chief Finance Officer (CFO).

BG has instead proposed an alternate model which has one ''boss'' running the show and partners (ONGC and RIL) involved the macro-level planning, they said adding ONGC has contested the model saying it deviates from the March MoU signed by the three partners to equally share responsibility in the field.

While Naik is in favour of Indian partners being involved in day-to-day functioning of the field, ONGC-RIL would bring into force the notice of removal of operator which was kept in abeyance after BG in March.

13,Hurriyat may break up after polls: Omar,"SRINAGAR: Accusing the Hurriyat Conference of being responsible for the ongoing bloodshed in Jammu and Kashmir, National Conference chief Omar Abdullah on Sunday said the separatist amalgam was facing an ideological crisis and was likely to disintegrate after the Assembly elections in the state.

""Each constituent of the Hurriyat is pushing its own thought process and ideology while sharing a common platform which is showing signs of disintegration,"" Omar told a group of foreign journalists here.

""While the Lone brothers (sons of slain Peoples Conference founder Abdul Gani Lone) were participating in the elections through proxy candidates, former Hurriyat Chairman Mirwaiz Umar Farooq was in USA and not toeing the boycott theory. Present Hurriyat Chairman Abdul Gani Bhat has climbed down from azadi to India or Pakistan,"" he claimed that this was a clear indication of the fragility in the 23-party conglomerate.

""Hurriyat leaders are now talking anything short of azadi,"" Omar, who is the NC''s chief ministerial candidate, said.

Defending NC''s main poll plank of autonomy, he said even the Hurriyat Conference is talking of autonomy while the Congress has placed autonomy in its manifesto.

This is a clear vindication of the stand of the NC which understood the mood of the people much before others, he added.

14,Pak attempt to disrupt J&K polls a failure: Advani,"NEW DELHI: Terming Pakistan''s bid to disrupt Assembly elections in Jammu and Kashmir as ""failure"", Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani on Sunday asserted there would be free and fair polling in the state as people are participating in the process with ""enthusiasm"" in their quest for an end to terrorism.

""Despite stepped-up terrorist attacks in Jammu and Kashmir as part of Pakistan''s attempt to disrupt polls, people are taking part with great enthusiasm as they feel violence should stop and, for this, impartial election is needed,"" Advani told reporters here.

""They think increasing participation in the poll process would play a significant role in stamping out terrorism"", Advani, who was speaking after inaugurating a photo exhibition of veteran photographer Vijendra Tyagi, said.

Even the assassination of state law minister Mushtaq Ahmed Lone has failed to create any adverse impact on the election process as intended by Pakistan, he said adding that Sunday''s attack on state tourism Minister Sakeena Itoo was yet another attempt to disrupt elections.

Asserting that security forces have succeeded in curbing terrorism effectively, Advani said the biggest success is the fact that Pakistan has now failed to lure Kashmiris for armed training and send them back to Kashmir for violence.

""Now only foreign merceneries including Afghans and others are being sent for terrorist violence in Jammu and Kashmir"", he said.

15,UP govt being pressurised in Babri case: Arjun Singh,"

NEW DELHI: Veteran Congress leader Arjun Singh on Sunday accused the Union home ministry of applying pressure on the Uttar Pradesh government not to issue fresh notification needed for framing of charges in the Babri Masjid demolition case.

In a letter to Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani, he said the chargesheet filed by the CBI in the case has been lying in ""suspended animation"" since the Lucknow bench of the Allahabad High Court quashed framing of charges on technical grounds but held that the legal infirmity could be rectified through a fresh notification.

Stating that some prominent BJP leaders, including ministers of the Central government are accused in the case, Singh said, ""The fact that the process of law have been held up in such a crime because of system stalemate is a matter of great concern to the law abiding citizens of the country"".

""Unfortunately, on the contrary there have been persistent reports that the Union home ministry, instead of extending its support for a prosecution in the case, is applying subtle pressure on the UP government not to go ahead to have the new notification issued"", he said.

Singh, further said, that he would raise the matter in the meeting of the consultative committee of the home ministry scheduled to be held on Monday.

17,Six-seaters to hold protest on Sep 24,"PUNE: Over 1,000 six-seater operators gathered at Ambedkar chowk in Pimpri on Saturday in protest against the ban on their vehicles proposed by Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad municipal (PMC and PCMC) limits from October 1.

They resolved to stage a mammoth rally in front of the divisional commissionerate on September 24.

Addressing the meeting, Shiv Sena MLA Gajanan Babar sought to know why only six-seater diesel rickshaws were being targeted by the authorities.

â€œDo they mean to say that other diesel vehicles like jeeps, cars, trucks and buses do not cause any pollution,â€� he asked.

To counter the proposed ban, six-seater rickshaw unions are holding talks with rickshaw manufacturers to explore ways of drastically cutting pollution caused by their vehicles.

â€œThe Bombay high court had rejected our petition challenging the ban saying that the six-seater rickshaws cause pollution. We will prove that the six seaters can be operated without causing pollution,â€� boasted Nitin Jagtap of Pune Nationalist Six-Seater Rickshaw Union.

Babar told the protestors that he and Jagtap had Abhay Firodia, managing director, Bajaj Tempo, of the prominent manufacturers of six-seaters.

Jagtap said that he had requested the manufacturer to explore the possibility adapting the vehicles to non-polluting liquefied petroleum gas.

Firodia, however, told TNN, â€œIt is not easy to convert diesel rickshaws LPG. We are not considering it at the moment,â€�. asserted that the sixseaters manufactured his company â€œare non-polluting and safe.â€�

The industrialist alleged that no action was being taken against vehicles primarily responsible for pollution â€œbecause vested interests.â€�

Jagtap said that would move a review petition before the high court bringing to its notice rickshaw drivers were willing to make necessary changes in their vehicles to reduce pollution.

Also, diesel with low sulphur contents is to be made available in Pune in October, he added.

19,This village has a ‘home truth’ for policy makers,"DHUNIKE: Most government schemes begin with much fanfare only to cause disillusionment later on.

About 35 dalit and poor families of this village, who had demolished their mud (â€˜kuchaâ€™) houses in the hope of getting concrete houses under a union government scheme, are now without a roof over their heads.

The scheme to convert kucha houses of the poor and landless families in villages into concrete two-room houses was started three-four years ago.

In response to the scheme, about 50 dalit families demolished their mud houses. But before the houses could be constructed, the funds dried up.

Punjab Khet Mazdoor Union (PKMU) general secretary Laxman Singh Sewewala said that under the scheme, except for six none of the houses had roofs.

With no hope of any help from the government in sight, some affected families have again constructed mud houses, while others have laid temporary roofs. The affected families alleged that there was misappropriation of funds meant for the construction of the houses.

Similar is the fate of 150 landless and homeless Dalit labourers of the Lambi area in Muktsar district, the home constituency of former Punjab chief minister

Parkash Singh Badal. Just before the assembly elections this year in Punjab, the poor dalits were promised five-marla plots by politicians. Most of the beneficiaries were even distributed allotment letters to this effect.

â€˜â€˜But now these allotment letters have been reduced to mere pieces of paper as as the present government has no intention to oblige those fooled by Badal to secure votes,â€� alleged Laxman Singh.

He said the PKMU has decided to organise a dharna in front of the office of the block development officer, Lambi, to pressurise the government to hand over the possession of the land.

â€˜â€˜In Bathinda district, 4,225 allottees were allotted plots during the SADBJP regime, but none of them have been given possession of these plots,â€� he added.

Addressing a training programme of party workers in Gangarampur in South Dinajpur district on Saturday evening, the Trinamul chief alleged the ruling LF has failed to bring about any improvement in health, education and power sectors. It has done very little to provide adequate employment opportunities to the people despite having been in power for the last 26 years, she alleged.

23,Bengal to be party in Railway zone case,"KOLKATA: The West Bengal government getting ready to become a party to the case before the Supreme Court filed by some railway unions challenging the decision of the railway ministry to create seven new railway zones, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said at a public meeting in Kolkata on Sunday.

â€œWe will tell the court the arguments we had given to Prime Minister Vajpayee, opposing the creation of new railway zones,â€� he told an SFI-DYFI meeting.

Referring to the Rajdhani Express accident, he said Rs 3,500 crore would be spent on creation of new zones, yet there were not enough funds to ensure safety of passengers. In the infotech age no worthwhile purpose would be served by creating new zones. â€œIt is now possible to control things centrally.â€�

He added that the state government would tell the Supreme Court that the Election Commission was right in saying the time was not appropriate for elections in Gujarat. The state government, along with other state governments and major political parties, is also a party to the case before the apex court on Guajarat elections.

He said thousands of people in Gujarat were still living in refugee camps, not confident going back home. Thousands of others, belonging to the minority community, had left Gujarat feeling the state was not safe for them.

He said the head of the physics department of Baroda University,who had recently been in the city, was unable to attend the university or go home, because he belonged to the minority community.

â€œIf this happens to a professor, one can imagine how others are suffering.â€� According to him, what had happened in Gujarat was not a communal riot but a â€œgenocideâ€�.

He said one aim of the attack on the minority community in Gujarat was to break their economy. Small factories, shops and restaurants owned by the community were selectively set on fire.

24,J&K minister attacked on poll eve,"SRINAGAR: Continuing their attempts to disrupt the election process in Jammu and Kashmir, militants made an abortive bid on the life of state tourism minister Sakeena Itoo on Sunday, even as the state geared up for the first phase of polls on Monday.

The attack on Ms Itoo took place around 12.30 p.m. near Dhamhal Hanjipora of Anantnag district when she was on her way to Danev-Kandimarg for an election rally. The militants first exploded an improvised explosive device and then opened fire.

Although Ms Itoo escaped unhurt, a CRPF sub-inspector was killed and two other persons were seriously injured.

This was the second attempt on Ms Itooâ€™s life in the last five days. On Wednesday, militants had hurled a grenade at her house in Dhamhal Hanjipora, injuring four of her party activists.

This was the first major militant strike in South Kashmir, which is going to the polls in the third phase on October 1.

The attack came barely five days after the assassination of law minister Mushtaq Ahmad Lone in Kupwara.

Despite the threats from militants, an electorate of nearly 15 lakh is expected to exercise its franchise on Monday. The voters will choose 23 representatives from nearly 160 candidates, including speaker Abdul Ahmad Vakil, six ministers and militant-turned-politician Kuka Parray, in the first phase of polling in Rajouri, Poonch, Kupwara, Baramulla and Kargil districts, where almost all polling centres have been declared hyper-sensitive or sensitive.

Some Sikh residents of Patan in Baramulla district said they would vote if the majority community did so. â€œThe fear factor is keeping us undecided. But we shall definitely vote, even if one member of the majority community votes,â€™â€™ said Shivdev Singh.

The community is still to come out of the Chattisingpora incident, another resident added.

The 12,000-strong Sikh votes may play a crucial role in Baramulla. â€œOur votes will be crucial for two reasons: First, because Sikhs have been voting en block here, and secondly, because the voter turnout is expected to be low. If that happens, the Sikh votes will decide the winner,â€™â€™ said Shiromani Akali Dal, Kashmir, president Janak Singh Sodhi.

Diplomats from 28 countries, including the US, European Union, Canada and Australia, will witness the first phase of the staggered elections.

Meanwhile, in a setback to militantsâ€™ plans to disrupt the elections, security forces arrested nine militants of the pro-Pakistan Jaish-e-Mohammad from various parts of Srinagar and recovered huge amount of arms and ammunition from them.

Presenting the arrested militants before the media on Sunday, BSF deputy inspector-general R.S. Bhullar said they ewre planning to disrupt the polls.

According to intelligence intercepts, the suicide squad chief of the Jaish was visiting Srinagar everyday along with three other members to carry out attacks.

26,SMC dress code increases efficiency of staff,"SURAT: Can you think of a way to increase the efficiency of a municipal setup. Well one of the ways implemented about three years back by the then Surat Municipal Commissioner S Jagdeeshan is still working well in Surat.

The Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC), three years back, introduced uniforms for all its staff members.

â€œThis has really put a curb on office-hour shopping by women and the activities of other staff members who went out on their personal endeavours, sometimes immediately after marking there attendance,â€� says deputy municipal commissioner (general) Ashwin Mehta.

In SMC even the commissioner is expected to wear the same uniform as a department clerk.

Mehta said like other government run organisations, the SMC staff used to earlier go around meeting clients as insurance agents or indulged in some side-business.

These activities were however curbed to a great extent after the dress code was implemented.

â€œIt has definitely given us a sense of belonging to the establishment, though for many its has come more like a restriction,â€� admits the SMC public relation officer Pratima Chaudhary.

Its has definitely improved the efficiency in terms of work hours, she adds.

According to Mehta, the increased efficiency has had a direct impact on corporation revenue. It has increased by about 15 per cent in the first year in addition to its standard 10 per cent growth.

As of now, the SMC has been the top most revenue earning civic body,which registered a collection of Rs 470 crore this year from octroi, property tax and capital income sources.

Under the dress code, while class four staff have been given the dark brown pants with beige coloured shirts, the commissioner and his men wear sky blue shirts and black trousers.

Women staff wear the blue printed saress or salwar kameez. The fourth class women have been given a combination in beige.

The uniform code is maintained by the heads of the respective departments. The corporation had also engaged people of the vigilance wing to move around in the city to catch staff members not wearing uniform.

The drive turned out to be effective. â€œOn many occasions, like when we are executing a demolition drive, its becomes easy for the police to identify us in the crowd and ensure protection,â€� says another SMC staff member.
