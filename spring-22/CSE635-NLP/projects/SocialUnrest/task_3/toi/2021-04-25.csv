0,Holy trinity in Kerala politics,"NEW DELHI: In Kerala, the father, son and the holy spirit have stopped fighting each other. Congress veteran K Karunakaran, his son Muralidharan and the holier-than-thou chief minister AK Antony have patched up with a friendship formula more weird than their fight.

The father goes to the Rajya Sabha, the daughter gets Mukundapuram LS seat, the son contests from Vadakkancherry assembly seat to remain a minister and Antony is assured of stability till the polls.

Would such a peace in the party make people poll for the holy trinity? Well, this is one reason why the CPM led Left Democratic Front hopes to better its performance.

Congress is like a coalition between the Karunakaran faction, Antony faction and two smaller groups. And that too a bad one which cannot be managed by a common minimum programme because the CMP is power.

How power drives each faction to the extremities of the state''s politics could be understood by recalling that Antony had earlier walked out of Congress and joined LDF to defeat Karunakaran-led Congress.

And more than anyone else, Antony knows how debilitating such a split could be. After all, this trendsetter state had rejected the single party rule of Congress even while it was Travancore-Cochin.

And much before Mandal dawned in north India, Kerala had parties for Nairs, Ezhavas, Christians and Muslims. And to Karunakaran''s credit he had forged a coalition of these forces to form a government.

Antony took Karunakaran''s recent threat to split the party seriously because the LDF hinted it''s willingness to support Karunakaran from outside. Karunakaran was ousted from power in 1995 and Antony made the CM when the former had over a year to go.

When the Congress-led United Democratic Front returned to power after the mandatory five-year interlude of the LDF rule, Antony again bacame the CM. But Karunakaran began pleading, fighting and blackmailing for his residual term in office.

His plans floundered for two reasons: the Left was never serious as it wanted early elections not the ignominy of supporting Karunakaran and Karunakaran''s flock was in disarray as it felt the ''leader'' was more interested in promoting his children than them.

Karunakaran''s chelas read their leader correctly. Antony played on to the Octagenarian''s biggest weakness, his children, by accomodating both of them in crucial positions. TNN

1,Long weekend casts shadow on polls,"MUMBAI: Call it the extended weekend effect casting its long shadow on the polls. Least bothered about casting their vote on Monday, hundreds of families have packed their bags and left the city for cooler climes, taking advantage of the three-day holiday from Saturday to Monday.

Sweet revenge this, some would say. ""They were never around when we needed them and so why should we be around when they need us?"" asked Madhav Karve, a software engineer from Hindu Colony, Dadar, who is off to Matheran with his family.

The Karves, like scores of Mumbaiites, have decided to play truant when the great Indian democracy comes calling on Monday.

""There was a sudden spurt in bookings as soon as April 26 was announced as polling day in Mumbai,"" says Veena Patil, managing director, Kesari Tours and Travels. ""More than 2000 bookings have been done for dates between April 23 and 26.""

Summer vacations, coupled with a long weekend, will be affecting the voting percentage this time. ""The bookings from Mumbai doubled this week,"" says Ketan Juvekar, the western region chairman of TravelAgents Association of India (TAAI).

Talking to TNN while travelling along the Mumbai-Pune Highway, he says, ""Yes, my family too will be giving the polls a miss. But weâ€™d specially asked every client whether they wanted to reach Mumbai before 5 pm on Monday. The answer was an emphatic no.""

Many picnickers are heading straight for the Western Express Highway which takes them from Borivli to Silvassa in Gujarat in two hours flat. ""Bookings to Silvassa were particularly good as it is perfect for a short vacation,"" says Juvekar.

Political parties too know well that there are many who would rather opt for a holiday than for that deciding dot on the index finger. ""Since the last one week, all our candidates have appealed to people not to leave the city as part of their campaign speech,"" says BJP leader, Vinod Tawde. ""The target areas for such appeals have been Bhuleshwar, Garodia Nagar in Ghatkopar, Mulund, Kandivli and Borivli.""

For the BJP, the long weekend also brings back memories of the 1999 Lok Sabha-assembly combined elections, held during Ganesh Chaturthi festival in September. ""We lost around 5,000 to 7,000 votes due to the holiday season,"" Tawde recollects.

While Monday blues takes on an entirely new meaning for politicians this time around, it has meant ringing cash registers for hoteliers and travel agents. ""Though we start getting fully booked only by the first week of May, this time thanks to the three-day holiday we are completely packed,"" says Shiavax Lord, owner of 23-room Lord Central Hotel in Matheran.

Sunil Zaveri, owner of Hotel Lake-view, a three-star, 50-room hotel in Mahableshwar, adds, ""We are totally sold out.""

But the scene isn''t all gloom and doom. ""There is a lot more interest in the election process than before, and quite a lot of people are staying back,"" says AGNI co-ordinator of D Ward, Indrani Malkani.

Like Shashi Vyas, director of an event management company, who will be off to Matheran early on Sunday morning. ""But I''ll be back before 5 pm on Monday,"" he promises.

2,Teenager helps arrest first culprit in attacks on elderly,"PUNE: At long last, the first arrest in the recent spate of attacks and muggings involving senior citizens was made in the city on Saturday.

Interestingly, it was the teenage grandson of the 19th victim and a shopkeeper, who nabbed the attacker, not the police.

It happened around 9.45 am, when one Indira Surudkar (80) of Kasba Peth was on a visit to a local temple with her grandson Yogesh (18), the Faraskhana police said. While Surudkar went inside the temple, Yogesh waited at a shop outside.

As soon as she emerged from the temple, the attacker, later identified as Chandrakant Baluch (29) of Nana Peth, pushed her from behind and snatched her gold chain worth Rs 9,000. When Surudkar raised the alarm, one Vinay Shah, who runs a shop nearby, immediately started chasing Baluch.

Yogesh too joined in the chase. The duo managed to catch Baluch near the Umbrya Maruti chowk in Kasba Peth and handed him over to the police.

The police have recovered the chain and registered a complaint of robbery against Baluch. They are still investigating whether Baluch had any connection with the rest of the attacks in the city.

A pan masala salesman by profession, Baluch has no known criminal record.

A native of Sangamner, Ahmednagar, he, his wife and daughter have been living with his in-laws in Pune, the police said. He had, however, not reported at work for the last two days, they added.

There has been a remarkable rise in crime against the elderly in this erstwhile ""pensioners'' paradise"" since November 23, 2003.

The 19 cases involve two murders, besides cases of theft, cheating and mugging.

3,Traders pledge support to BJP-led NDA govt,"RANCHI: Representatives of various business organisations on Saturday pledged their support to the BJP-led-NDA government, saying, the policies of the government had helped the trade and industry flourish in the country.

At a joint press conference, the representatives of the Federation of Jharkhand Chambers of Commerce and Industries (FJCCI), Real Estate Developers Association of Jharkhand (REDAJ), Builders Association of India (BAI), etc. said, the country''s economy is one of the fastest growing economy in the world and essential commodities are easily available.

Besides, foreign exchange reserve is all time high.FJCCI president Bishnu Budhia said the country needs a stable government to progress, and the BJP, besides being capable of providing that stability also has vision for development.

One could not imagine the progress the country has made in the past five years all because of the policies of the government, he said.

Representatives, however, agreed that though the same coalition is ruling the state, similar progress has not been achieved in the past three years.

They hoped, the Central government would pressurise the state leadership to take adequate measures for development.

They added that political immaturity coupled with internal strife among the partners of the NDA here led to this situation.

4,Oppn for resignation of ministers,"RANCHI: The opposition parties in the state on Saturday demanded resignation of two JD-U ministers in the Munda government on separate grounds.

The demand came in the wake of framing of charges against urban development minister Baccha Singh in a double murder case on Friday and an FIR filed against land and revenue minister Madhu Singh for his alleged involvement in a street brawl at Panki in Palamu district a day before.

The duo have already denied its involvement in respective cases. The opposition leader in the state assembly Stephen Marandi told reporters that by convention they should put in their papers.

Asking the chief minister to expel them, JPCC president Thomas Hansda said, the two ministers had no right to continue in their offices in the larger interest of democracy.

The state unit secretary of the CPI(M), J S Majumdar said, ""these things are not new for the two ministers. In the past also they got away, as they know the weakness of the BJP who wants to cling on to power.""

Mahendra Singh, the central committee member of the CPI (ML- Liberation) alleged Madhu Singh had been facing the people''s ire for his ''non-performance'' while cases were not new for Baccha Singh.

He demanded a judicial probe into Thursday''s incident in which Madhu Singh and his nephew had suffered injuries while 5 ML activists received bullet injuries after the clash, simmering for months between the rival supporters.

A fast track court in Dhanbad had on Friday framed charges against Baccha Singh in connection with murders of Vinod Singh in 2000 and Sakaldev Singh in 2002.

5,BJP asks poll panel to arrest Laloo,"PATNA: BJP on Saturday demanded immediate arrest of RJD national president Laloo Prasad Yadav for allegedly giving a provocative advertisement in a local Urdu daily requesting Muslim voters not to vote for NDA candidates in the Lok Sabha (LS) polls.

The RJD advertisement appeared in Saturday''s edition of the Urdu daily.

In a memorandum submitted on Saturday to the special EC observer for Bihar, L V Saptarishi, BJP claimed that the RJD poll ad was a clear violation of model code of conduct as it was provocative in nature and could foment communal tension in the society.

Taking strong exception to the RJD poll ad, BJP has demanded arrest of Laloo saying he was responsible for it. BJP has submitted the clipping of the controversial RJD ad to the EC.

Addressing a press conference here at BJP headquarters, chief whip of BJP legislature party in state assembly Navin Kishore Prasad Sinha and party spokesperson Kiran Ghai said that the party had also drawn the attention of CEC and chief electoral officer (CEO), Bihar, towards the decision of state administration to send five junior police officials; Pramod Kumar, Ram Sagar Yadav, B K Gope, Kailash Chaudhary and Mohammad Hasnain to Chapra on poll duty on deputation.

Sinha while alleging that all these police officials were considered quite close to RJD hence could influence election to Chhapra constituency. He said that all the five police officials were likely to reach Chhapra on Sunday.

BJP has urged the EC to hold election to Chhapra seat under its direct supervision. Apart from it, Sinha said, BJP had also drawn the attention of EC towards the recent recruitment of about 4,000 RJD workers in Arwal and Jehanabad and their deployment in Motihari constituency.

Sinha claimed that the move was aimed at helping RJD nominee from Motihari and junior health minister Akhilesh Prasad Singh. BJP has also demanded immediate arrest of notorious criminal of West Champaran district Bhagar Yadav saying he was terrorising voters of Bettiah constituency.

Sinha said that Saptarishi had assured BJP delegation that EC would look into the complaint lodged by the party. Sinha said that Saptarishi was likely to hold discussion with the top officials of state administration and CEO on the points raised by BJP.

Criticising the EC for its failure to provide for issuing of residential certificates to voters of urban areas for the first phase of LS polls, Sinha said that EC should immediately authorise concerned officials of all Nagar Parishad, Nagarpalika and Nagar Nigams to issue residential certificates to urban voters not having any identification mark for the second and third phase of polls.

The EC was likely to take a decision in this regard before second phase of LS polls scheduled for April 26.

BJP has also demanded re-poll at all the urban polling stations of Sasaram and Gaya constituencies saying the voters'' list given to candidates and presiding officers did not tally, which deprived a large number of voters from exercising their franchise.

6,Phase II polls in state to be colourful,"PATNA: The 17 parliamentary constituencies in Bihar, where campaign ended on Saturday evening for polling in the second phase on April 26, promise colourful contests with Union ministers, former chief ministers, a film director, a former cricketer, a couple of infamous musclemen or bullies, and deserters being in the fray.

The constituencies are Bagaha, Bettiah, Motihari, Gopalganj, Siwan, Maharajganj, Chhapra, Hajipur, Vaishali, Muzaffarpur, Sitamarhi, Sheohar, Madhubani, Jhanjharpur, Darbhanga, Rosera and Samastipur.

The two Union ministers, who are waiting for their luck to unfold, are defence minister George Fernandes of JD-U for the Muzaffarpur seat and civil aviation minister Rajiv Pratap Rudy of BJP for Chhapra seat.

Former Union minister and Lok Janshakti Party chief Ram Vilas Paswan has stuck to his traditional seat Hajipur.

The two former chief ministers with contrasting styles are RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav for the Chhapra seat and Jagannath Mishra on the JD(U) ticket from Jhanjharpur constituency.

While inaccessibility of Rudy has become an issue, Laloo, nonetheless, has to labour against him, given the polarisation of votes along caste lines.

If ''garam dharam'' declared in Bikaner that he would like to be a dictator, filmmaker Prakash Jha is trying for a ''Hip Hip Hurray'' from the Bettiah constituency.

He has gone on record saying that Army should be deployed in his constituency to check criminals from rigging polls.

Former cricketer Kirti Azad, who sported a pony tail raising many an eyebrow of conservative Brahmins, had earlier dabbled in the politics of Cricket Association of Bihar (CAB) with ""tacit nod"" from BCCI chairman Jagmohan Dalmiya alias Dada.

Azad has to do much explaining as to what all did he do as the sitting MP for the electorate in Darbhanga, apart from organising a cricket tournament there.

Among musclemen, the prime slot has been taken by sitting RJD MP of Siwan Mohd Shahabuddin. On Friday, he invited Patna High Court''s censure for campaigning from hospital where he has been admitted for ""treatment"" while in judicial custody.

The other such candidate is MLA Rajan Tiwari, who is trying his luck to enter Parliament from Bettiah as an Independent candidate.

Among the ""bullies"" are chief minister''s brother Sadhu Yadav on the RJD ticket for the Gopalganj seat who is pitted against Kali Prasad Pandey, an Independent.

The prominent turncoats testing their luck include Anwarul Haque on the BJP ticket; former Union minister Devendra Prasad Yadav from Jhanjharpur on the RJD''s; BSP nominee Poornamasi Ram from Bagaha on JD(U)''s and Chhedi Paswan, also on BSP ticket, from Hajipur.

While Haq deserted RJD, Yadav deserted JD-U on poll eve. Both Ram and Chhedi Paswan were ministers in RJD government till they decided to contest polls even after their party denied them tickets.

Former CM Mishra also deserted Nationalist Congress Party to fight election on JD(U) ticket.
