0,CM ready to induct more ministers: Katiyar,"LUCKNOW: Giving ample indications that another cabinet expansion was in the offing, Bhartiya Janata Party state president Vinay Katiyar on Sunday said chief minister Mayawati had agreed in principle that the number of ministers should be in proportion to the strength of party MLAs .

Addressing a press conference Katiyar said he along with urban development minister Lalji Tandon met Mayawati on Saturday night and apprised her that the BJP and the allies had not been adequately represented in the ministry vis a vis their strength which he put at 111.

Compared to this the CM was told that the BSPâ€™s strength stood at 99 but both BJP and BSP have 39 ministers each.

Katiyar added the CM agreed that the ministers should be in proportion to the strength of the party MLAs. He, however, refused to spell out when the induction of the new ministers would take place. ""Political process was a continous one and decisions would be taken as and when needed"", he said.

Regarding the prevailing discontentment in the party over the recent cabinet expansion, Katiyar said it was very natural as every one had expectations but not all could be accomodated. There was a limit to the number of people who could be taken in the ministry or made cabinet rank ministers,he added. To a pointed query about many senior leaders being ignored in the recent expansion Katiyar said he would be talking to them individually and added that seniors could not be slotted in the â€˜discontentedâ€™ category. They were merely angry. Their services and experience would be put to use in party affairs,he said.

Katiyar said he had got a letter from merely one senior leader Ganga Bux Singh in which Singh had asked him for marg darshan in his capacity as state president of the party. On the non-induction of independant MLA Raghuraj Pratap Singh alias Raja Bhaiyya in the cabinet,Katiyar said it was an internal matter of the party and Mayawati had nothing to do with it.

1,Modi criticised for illtreating riot victims,"LUCKNOW: State council of the CPI has criticised Gujarat CM Narendra Modi for maltreating hundreds of riot victims taking shelter in relief camps of the state.

According to state secretary Ashok Mishra, the council which held a prolonged discussion on Gujarat affairs, felt that inmates of the relief camps were being forced to stay put there, though many of them wanted to get back to their homes. They were being told that they might face fresh attacks, if they reached their homes, said Mishra.

â€œMembers of the council opined that the BJP wanted to incite communal passions so that it could reap the benefits of communal divide at the time of assembly polls,â€� the state secretary said, adding that even distribution of relief material was not done properly.

About Gaurav Yatra, Mishra said that BJP leaders used it to incite communal passions by making provocative speeches. Even DPM LK Advani praised the organisers of this yatra, the CPI secretary said. He said that the party would organise a rally in Lucknow on November 16 and stage a demonstration outside Parliament on February 26, while labour organisations associated with the CPI would organise rallies in the state from November 18 to 23. National secretary of the CPI Atul Kumar Anjan, who also participated in the council meeting, said that after the Jammu and Kashmir poll results, the Centre had come to the conclusion that the installation of the Congress and PDP government would bring only trouble for the NDA government.

Anjan said that the massive turnout at the â€˜dhikkarâ€™ rally of the BSP was possible by misuse of official machinery. The participants were told that they should come with their petitions to the chief minister and get their demands redressed, Anjan added.

2,Lok Ayukt Bill: State government weighing options,"KOLKATA: Who should be the competent authority to sanction investigation into corruption charges against ministers â€“ even the chief minister â€“ in the Lok Ayukt Bill? The Left Front government is in a mood to follow the BJP-led Centre on this issue, as state law minister Nishith Adhikari wanted the chief minister to hold the key during the meeting of the Assembly select committee on Friday.

""In the Lokpal Bill introduced by the Centre, it is the Prime Minister who would decide about a probe into corruption charges against other public functionaries,"" Adhikari said.

Opposition leader Pankaj Banerjee, Congress veteran Abdul Mannan and Trinamul Congress MLA Tapas Roy, however, maintained that political executives should not be allowed to be judges. While the Opposition would accept the governor as the sanctioning authority as in the case of government servants in the Prevention of Corruption Act, the state government declined to hand over the ""potentially self-destructive weapon"" to the Raj Bhavan. Adhikari argued in favour of an Assembly committee sanctioning probe and prosecution if the chief minister faced charges. He was also not ready to make provisions for prosecuting the Speaker and deputy speaker of the Assembly.

The Opposition, however, was able to extract its pound of flesh as the government agreed to spare the leader of the Opposition as well.

3,LJP condemns Centre’s PSU sell-off policy,"PATNA: Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) state president Narendra Singh has condemned the Centreâ€™s decision to sell its profit-making public sector units (PSUs) at throwaway prices to foreign and native industrialists.

It was being done with a great fanfare as if something great had been achieved, he added. Singh said the other MNCs, which have established their place in the world market, are being run by Indian hands, whereas the Indian government, with brazen shamelessness has accepted its failure in running the PSUs.

This is being projected as the result of the â€œground realityâ€�, he said, adding: â€œSuch an auction of the Indian PSUs has never been witnessed, and not even heard before.â€�

Singh has accused the Centre of showing extraordinary loyalty to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) by changing the economic policies of the country, and a new ministry has been started as disinvestment ministry for selling these industries.

4,"Mulayam, Laloo assail NDA govt","PATNA: Describing the BJP-led NDA governmentâ€™s three-year rule as a â€œblack spotâ€� in the annals of Indian democratic history, RJD supremo Laloo Prasad Yadav has demanded Atal Bihari Vajpayeeâ€™s immediate resignation in the interest of the nation.

While talking to media persons here on Sunday, Yadav said the three-year tenure of NDA government will be remembered as years of scams. Major scams like Tehelka, stock exchange, Unit Trust of India and coffin scandals were witnessed during Vajpayeeâ€™s tenure.

He said the Vajpayee government did nothing during its three years in office which can be praised. It has totally failed on all fronts, he added. â€œThe only thing it has successfully done is to spread communal tension across the country during its three-year governance. The worst ever communal riot in Gujarat has denigrated the secular traditions of the country,â€� he said and alleged that the BJP government in Gujarat totally failed to curb the communal violence in Gujarat where hundreds of innocent people were killed.

On countryâ€™s foreign relations, he said the faulty policy of the government had resulted into deterioration of the countryâ€™s relations with all its neighbours.

Meanwhile, Samajwadi Party president Mulayam Singh Yadav, who was in Patna on Sunday, charged the NDA government with being â€œremote controlledâ€� by foreign powers..

â€œVajpayee government is dancing to the tune of foreign powers and multinationals and they are â€˜remote controllingâ€™ the Indian economy and external affairs,â€� Mulayam was here to attend the shraddh ceremony of the party leader Kapildeo Singh.

5,Sanction granted to prosecute minister’s kin,"PATNA: In what is seen as a major boost to Bihar CID, the state government has finally granted sanction to prosecute then assistant commissioner, commercial taxes, Ranchi, Nasiruddin Hyder Khan in seven cases for conniving with traders and abetting tax evasion. Khan is the son-in-law of senior Bihar minister Ghulam Sarwar.

â€œThe sanctions were received last week and they have already been sent to Jharkhand for further action,â€� a senior government official told The Times of India on Saturday. With seven sanctions against Khan, the state CID has received as many as 12 prosecution sanctions against the accused in the infamous cases pertaining to massive tax evasion as well as theft of tax collection forms from the offices of commercial taxes.

A study made by the economic offences wing (EOW) of the state CID has put commercial tax evasion on edible oils alone during the last four years at Rs 186 crore.

In 1996, it may be recalled, 16 cases of tax evasion to the tune of Rs 32 crore through misuse of statutory â€œCâ€� and â€œFâ€� forms were lodged with the Ranchi police at the initiative of then joint commissioner, commercial taxes, Ranchi, Shivendu.

Subsequently, the cases were handed over to EOW inspector general Manoje Nath for investigation.

During the investigations, the EOW moved the court with a request to allow it to investigate old cases as well which had been closed for want of evidence.

According to sources, 45 such cases were investigated by the EOW which included 33 cases relating to Jharkhand.

The 65 officials who were named accused in these cases involving trade worth over Rs 155 crore included 11 senior commercial taxes officials.While five sanctions for prosecution of officials were granted long back, the file pertaining to the same in seven cases against the ministerâ€™s kin kept moving from one office to another of the state government.

â€œThe EOW began the probe almost six years ago and it is now that the sanctions have come,â€� a CID official pointed out.

Interestingly, the EOW during its investigations put it on record that a group of officers seems to have developed nexus with, besides traders, powerful sections in politics.

So much so that the effectiveness and autonomy of the commercial taxes commissioner to take independent action appears to have been curtailed.

In fact, one of the businessmen accused in these cases made a voluntary confession that the commercial taxes officers egged them on to evade taxes, sources in the CID recalled, adding that the form manipulations were done by traders in full knowledge of the officers.

Commercial tax collection in the two states can be augmented by hundreds of crores if proper corrective measures are taken by the two governments, the EOW estimated during its investigations.

6,NDDB may assist in poultry farming,"NEW DELHI: The National Dairy Development Board (NDDB) has agreed to examine whether it could use its vast infrastructure to help small farmers and landless rural workers to do backyard poultry farming.

Union agriculture minister Ajit Singh had forwarded a request in this regard to NDDB chief Amrita Patel at a meeting here on Thursday.

The NDDB''s now-legendary establishment of a national grid of milk cooperatives â€” India is now the world''s largest milk producer â€” ensures its presence almost everywhere. It also boasts of years of expertise in helping small farmers to organise production and marketing.

The meeting had been called by Singh to ask NDDB to come to the help of drought-hit Rajasthan. The resulting steep fall in rural incomes has meant a glut of milk as families cut their own consumption, say officials.

Mother Dairy, a NDDB subsidiary, is already procuring around three lakh litres a day from the Rajasthan Cooperative Dairy Federation (RCDF).

On the request of milk producer unions, and Ajit Singh, NDDB has agreed to instruct Mother Dairy to take an additional two lakh litres a day of milk till December 31.

Besides, NDDB will buy an extra 1.5 lakh litres a day of milk from RCDF and convert this into milk powder, which can be stored indefinitely and reconverted into liquid milk.

7,Former J&K minister booked in assault case,"SRINAGAR: Former Jammu and Kashmir works minister Ali Sagar has been booked for allegedly assaulting the Srinagar deputy commissioner of police during the counting of votes on Thursday.

An FIR has also been registered against National Conference MLC Shameema Firdous for trying to snatch ballots from officers.

Poll observer K J Rao said the chief election commissioner had taken a serious note of the incident and directed J&K chief electoral officer Pramod Jain to follow up the case in court.

Returning officer Gulam Jeelani said the incident occurred when Firdous â€” who eventually lost from Habakaddal â€” tried to snatch ballots from poll officials when the counting was on, forcing the police to intervene.

Following this, Sagar â€” NC candidate from Khanyar â€” allegedly pounced upon Srinagar deputy commissioner of police Abdul Hamid and slapped him.

Senior superintendent of police R R Swain lodged FIRs against the two accused under Sections 188, 353 and 147 of the RPC.

The accused, said sources, had applied for anticipatory bail.

Hamid said that another case had been registered against Firdous under the People''s Representation Act.

8,These J&K polls were the bloodiest: Police,"SRINAGAR: It was fiercest and bloodiest elections in the militancy-torn Jammu and Kashmir. Of the last eight elections in the state, 2002 assembly polls have seen the maximum incidents of violence with Pakistan-sponsored terrorists desperate to disrupt the electoral process, highly placed sources in the Kashmir police said.

As many as 1300 militants have been killed this year in the state, out of which nearly 400 were killed during the election period, they said.

In 1996 Assembly elections, no candidate was killed and the fidayeen squads did not exist at the time in the state, whereas in the just concluded elections, two candidates were killed by militants.

9,J&K polls: Theories to fit results,"NEW DELHI: Those who boycotted the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly elections are now applauding the outcome of the same. But the interpretations are their own - to suit their own interests.

While the All-Party Hurriyat Conference described the electorate''s verdict as a rejection of both the state government as well as the Central government, the migrant Kashmiri Pandit organisation, Panun Kashmir, says the people have rejected the politics of the separatists and the autonomy demand of the National Conference government.

The Hurriyat Conference cynical prediction had been an ominous ""zero participation of people"". It even tried to urge the people not to participate in the process.

But as soon as the election results began pouring in, the Hurriyat leaders could not hold their excitement any longer.

Subsequently, their leaders explained the people''s response as ""their anger against the state and Central governments and the rejection of both"".

Panun Kashmir general secretary Ramesh Manwati said: ""The election results are clearly against the autonomy demand and the secessionist forces.

At the same time, the results are a clear indication of the necessity for the geo-political reorganisation of the whole state.

This was reflected by the unopposed election to the assembly of two candidates of the Ladakh Union Territory Front.""

He argued: ""The Centre should take full advantage of the positive culmination of the elections in Jammu and Kashmir and launch a pro-active policy against Pakistan by initiating a diplomatic offensive so that terrorism is put to an end in the state.""

Other Panun Kashmir leaders too tried to justify their abstention saying: ""We are not quite optimistic about our rehabilitation in the near future for the simple reason that the Congress and the People''s Democratic Party (PDP), which are likely to form a coalition government, are the same people who were at the helm of affairs when militancy actually started in J&K during 1987-89.""

10,"No dialogue with Pak unless violence ends, India tells US","NEW DELHI: India has firmly told the United States that there is no question of resumption of dialogue with Pakistan in the forseeable future as it continues to perpetrate violence in Jammu and Kashmir.

This statement raises doubts about Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee traveling to Islamabad in January for the Saarc Summit.

This was conveyed to US National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice when she spoke to her Indian counterpart Brajesh Mishra over telephone in Copenhagen earlier this week, highly placed sources said.

The US has been nudging India to resume dialogue with Pakistan and statements on this have been coming from Washington more frequently after the satisfactory conduct of the Assembly elections in Jammu and Kashmir.

How could the US expect India to start the dialogue if perpetrators of violence in Jammu and Kashmir, aided and abetted from across the borders, continued with their acts of terrorism, Mishra told Rice while informing her that over 800 lives had been lost ever since the democratic process was initiated in the Valley.

When asked if Vajpayee would be visiting Pakistan for the Saarc Summit three months from now, the sources said it was ""premature"" to talk about this since dates for it have not yet been finalised.

15,Naidu's brother returns to politics,"HYDERABAD/TIRUPATI: In an instance of open defiance, Nara Rama Murthy Naidu, brother of chief minister and Telugu Desam Party president N Chandrababu Naidu, took out a massive rally in Chittoor on Sunday, signalling his comeback to active politics.

Returning from a three-year hibernation, Rama Murthy Naidu arrived in Chittoor from Chennai to a rousing reception by local TDP leaders on Sunday.

The junior Naidu was persuaded to quit politics after he became involved in a controversy three years ago. Sensing the likely embarrassment the Sunday rally might cause to himself, the chief minister had sent a message to his brother on Saturday night advising him not to take out the rally and asked party leaders to prevail upon his brother.

But the junior Naidu disregarded the party presidentâ€™s directive and went ahead. Claiming that his brother had never asked him to quit politics, Rama Murthy Naidu explained to the audience at the Kanipakam temple in Tirupati, â€œI went abroad for three years for business purposes.""

He declared that if party workers wished him to contest the next election, he would not hesitate to do so.

Rama Murthy Naiduâ€™s rally was attended by several local leaders, including Chittoor municipality chairman Chengalraya Naidu, Chittoor cooperative sugar factory president N P Ramakrishna, whose wife was elected to the Rajya Sabha by the chief minister some time ago, former municipal chairman A S Manohar and district TDP publicity secretary V Surendranath.

After having a glimpse of Lord Ganapathi, the presiding deity of the temple, Naidu Jr. set out on the rally in a convoy of more than 300 vehicles, said to be unprecedented in the district. He was received by the executive officer of the temple with courtesies normally reserved for people in power.

Naidu was also allowed to use his office to address a press meet. Naidu Jr. revealed that he had requested the chief minister to nominate him as Kanipakam temple trust chairman and had even submitted a list of names for inclusion in the board. â€œThe chief minister may have his own reasons to keep my request pending,â€� he said.

Showing a sign of revolt, Naidu said TDP workers in the district wanted him to come back to politics and attend to their grievances.

Blaming the Congress for involving him in controversies, Rama Murthy Naidu said he has returned to the country to serve the people. Naidu is scheduled to stage similar rallies in five mandals in the chief ministerâ€™s native district.

16,BJP criticises INLD on law and order situation,"HISAR: Though an ally to the Indian National Lokdal, the BJP leadership in Haryana has explicitly denounced the anti-trade scenario in the state.

In an article published in the latest (October) issue of the monthly magazine of Haryana BJP â€œBhajpa kee Baat"" Rattan Lal Kataria, state BJP chief, has lauded the progress and development for water supply, expansion of education, grain production and road construction in the state but in the same breath decried the ugly situation on the trade and industry front.

Kataria criticised the deteriorating law and order situation, the dearth of basic amenities and rampant corruption.

The BJP chief said that all, including farmers, labourers, industrialists, shopkeepers and employees are unhappy and dissatisfied with the prevailing conditions in the state.

There are certain grave problems which require solid redressal. For proper irrigation of fields, the peasants require adequate power supply.

With the falling water table the future of agriculture is dark in the state and in many areas potable water is becoming scarce. The BJP leader further said, â€œThe mercantile ''health'' of the state is not good at all. Without giving any facility to the traders, the government is extracting taxes from them. Electricity is being provided at rates dearer than the neighbouring states.

""The mischievous elements are openly wandering in Haryana with incidents of rape, dacoity and snatching on the increase. The industrialists are shifting their units to other states. This trend is not conducive to the progress of the state,"" Kataria rued and added that, â€œDalits and backward classes have not been given ''honour'' which they deserve for their contribution to society. Poverty and unemployment among them has increased manifold.

""The traditional professions are on the wane. Higher education and health facilities are out of their reach. They are compelled to lead a pathetic life. This section of the society is still a neglected class.""

The BJP leader assailed the ''turn-wise'' rule of three families in Haryana. Though he did not name these families in the article he condemned the individualistic and dynastic rule in the state.

17,Former GM of spinning mill arrested for fraud,"KOTKAPURA: One of the four former general managers of the co-operative spinning mill at Sandhawan, Sukhdev Datt, who was booked for embezzlement of more than Rs 88 lakh two years ago, has been arrested by the Kotkapura police from his residence at Faridkot.

Currently Malhotra is posted as deputy spinning master in the co-operative spinning mill at Abohar.While the two other accused GMs, B P Gupta and S P Dahia are still absconding, the fourth, Rajan Malhotra has obtained anticipatory bail.

The scam was unearthed two years ago by the antifraud cell in the district. During investigation it was found that the accused, who were posted as general managers during October 1996 to August 1998, did not deposit the amount of provident fund of the employees, though this amount was deducted from their salaries.

Some 1,400 employees were working in the mill during this period and the total amount misappropriated by the accused came to Rs 88 lakh.

Following submission of an inquiry report, a case under section 405, 406 and 409 (criminal breach of trust by a public servant) of the IPC was registered against Dutt, Rajan Malhotra, B P Gupta and S P Dahia at sadar police station Kotkapura.

The mill was closed on February 22, 1999 due to heavy financial loss. While two of the accused retired in the interim period the other two were transferred to other mills in the state.

Instead of arresting the accused, the police declared the case as untraced under alleged political pressure as on of the accused was close to an Akali leader of the area. But the workers and union leaders continued to follow the case and with the change of the government it was reopened.

Criticising the lackadaisical attitude of the district police, Hardip Singh, the president and Resham Singh the general secretery of the spinning mill mazdoor union said they had to run from pillar to post to bring the culprits to book.

They demanded the other accused should be immediately arrested so that the embezzled amount may be recovered from them and distributed among the employees.

18,Badal's arrest won't trigger protests: Amarinder,"CHANDIGARH: Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh has ruled out any political upheaval or law and order problem in the event of Opposition leader Parkash Singh Badal being arrested on charges of corruption.

Talking to reporters after the oath ceremony of Punjab and Haryana chief justice Binod Kumar Roy at Punjab Raj Bhawan here on Monday, Amarinder Singh said there was no reason why people should stand by him if he were sent to jail for indulging in corruption and not for launching any political movement.

""Badal would be sent behind bars by the court and not by the government for amassing disproportionate assets,"" said Amarinder.

However, he did not reply to a specific question on whether Badal would be arrested before Diwali. Countering allegations of witch hunting, Amarinder Singh said all arrested former Akali ministers had assets far exceeding their known sources of income.

Explaining Badal''s ""modusoperandi,"" Amarinder, his one-time colleague, said Badal first created a crisis and then disappeared from the scene by getting himself arrested.

He would then re-emerge as hero once the crisis was over. But this won''t work for him this time, he said.

Meanwhile, responding to Amarinder''s remarks, Badal, who was in Bathinda, said his arrest would lead to a ""rebellion"" in the state against the ""tyranny"" of the Congress government.

""It would be for my party cadre to decide the course of action but Amarinder Singh would be responsible for any ugly situation,"" asserted Badal, adding that the Congress government would have to pay for torturing Akalis, including former ministers.

Amarinder Singh also justified providing security to SGPC members, saying that intelligence reports revealed that Badal planned to abduct and remove them to neighbouring Haryana on the eve of SGPC executive elections, due before November 30.

However, he clarified that only those SGPC members would be provided security who would seek it.

Distancing himself from SGPC politics, Amarinder Singh said he was not concerned who gained control of it â€” for him all were the same.

""They are all with blue turbans -whether light or dark â€” it is only a difference of shade,"" he said.

19,Expert accuses minister of meddling in probe,"MUMBAI: Housing expert Chandrashekhar Prabhu, who was appointed by the state government to investigate alleged irregularities in a slum rehabilitation scheme in Santa Cruz, has written a letter to chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh complaining about the interference of a Congress minister of state.

Mr Prabhu has not mentioned the minister''s name, but it is learnt that the minister is Kripashankar Singh. Mr Singh told TNN that he had not been told about any such complaint.

""I am not even aware of this slum,"" he said.

Mr Prabhu, who is the government''s advisor on housing matters, is believed to have criticised the minister for pressuring officials in the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) not to cooperate in the inquiry he was conducting. It is learnt that the documents pertaining to the case were not made available for the inquiry.

The alleged interference by the minister reportedly is aimed at protecting a builder who has committed the suspected irregularities while implementing the slum scheme. Mr Prabhu refused to comment, ""The issue is between me and the government,"" he said. His report, which was submitted to the government more than six months ago, said: ""I have tried several times to get the relevant replies from the authorities concerned. But, since there is no answer from the other side, I am left with no option but to record my findings in this matter.""

The matter pertains to a cooperative housing society in Shivaji Nagar, Santa Cruz (East). One section of the slum dwellers wanted the government''s slum rehabilitation scheme to be implemented.

But others said that because they had paid for the land, an earlier scheme that allowed them to purchase additional area, should be implemented. Meanwhile, the builder constructed two buildings, which allegedly flouted coastal regulation zone norms. He also had to face allegations that flat were allotmented were made to ineligible people. The matter went to court, which directed the SRA to probe these complaints.

In his report, Mr Prabhu said that although three years had passed since the judgment, the SRA had not initiated any action.

20,Charges framed in Gulbarg Society riot case,"AHMEDABAD: The city sessions court has framed charges against 23 accused for leading the attack on Gulbarg Society in Chamanpura on February 28. The accused have been charged for murdering 30, raping two women, arson, looting, unlawful assembly and inciting communal tension, among other crimes.

The charges were framed by additional city sessions judge BN Jani on Monday, seven months after the gruesome incident, against all the accused, including Kailas Lalchand Dhobi, Yogendrasingh alias Lalo Mohansingh, Surendrasingh alias Vakil Digvijaysingh Chauhan and others.

They all have been accused of causing mayhem in the Gulabarg Society on the said day. The court stated that they had gathered outside the society and shouted provocative slogans that incited a 20,000 to 22,000 strong Hindu mob.

After former Member of Parliament Ehsan Jaffery opened fire, the mob forced itself into the society by breaking open the walls in the front as well as the rear.

The court also stated that the mob was armed with swords, ''guptis'', ''khanjar'', inflammable liquid and pipes. They also pelted stones at the houses, looted and set them afire.

The meeting was held in a farmhouse in Gandhinagar district. The venue was kept a closely-guarded secret to avoid demonstrations and representations by supporters. So much was the extent of secrecy that all the leaders had switched off their phones and refused to entertain even calls from party members.

The meeting, described as â€œsomewhat stormyâ€�, continued late into the night where all the factions met to determine a method which would do justice to all the groups and also create a wave for the party. The results of J&K elections have turned the tide in favour of the party which now seeks to change its strategy of selecting candidates.

To compete with Chief Minister Narendra Modiâ€™s Gaurav Yatra, the Congress has decided to conduct a Lok Sampark programme in the coming days. Winnability of candidates is going to be the prime criterion in the selection process, while stress will also be laid on the caste factor.

Present at the meeting were Madhavsinh Solanki, Yogendra Makwana, former chief minister Amarsinh Chaudhary, Urmila Patel, Shankersinh Vaghela, Narhari Amin, Raju Parmar, Shaktisinh Gohil, Irshadbaig Mirza, Umakant Mankad, Mihir Shah among several others.
