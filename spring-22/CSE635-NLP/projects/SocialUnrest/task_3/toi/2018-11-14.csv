0,HC pulls up govt for neglecting forest land documentation,"mumbai: the bombay high court recently castigated the state government for neglecting the documentation of forest land. a division bench comprising chief justice b.p. singh and justice dhananjay chandrachud took a stern view of the ""unsatisfactory"" progress in updating land records and directed the state to file a comprehensive affidavit on the status of private forest land and to enumerate steps taken to update land records. although forests have been shrinking rapidly, land records for over three lakhs hectares are still to be updated more than 20 years after the maharashtra private forest (acquisition) act came into effect in 1975. callous and corrupt practices of the state government have led to the depletion of private forest land. it took a public interest litigation filed this year by the bombay environment action group (beag) on the misuse of private forest land to wake the state from its slumber. in 1975, the maharashtra private forest (acquisition) act came into force, bringing with it a whopping 3.03 lakhs hectares of private land under the fold of reserved forest area after the government acquired it. however, revenue records for much of the land acquired from private landlords have to be updated as the original landlord is still shown as the owner. the pil expressed concern at the largescale misuse of private forest land for non-forest purposes such as construction of buildings. beag's counsel rafiq dada pointed out that pursuant to the pil, the state government issued a circular in july 2001 from which it appears that certain guidelines were provided to prepare and implement a time-bound plan to update land records after acquisition of private forests. the acquired forests were deemed to be reserved forests under the mfa, which was amended in 1978 to provide that acquired private forest land had to be restored to a certain category of farmers. consequently, as much as 73,894 hectares of acquired private forest land were restored to farmers. the restoration of land to farmers was done prior to the promulgation of the forest (conservation) act, 1980. the forest conservator also noted that forest land restored to farmers was actually being used for building activities in ecologically-fragile zones such as alibaug, khandala and lonawala. the hc observed that forest land was being diverted for non-forest purposes in contravention of the forests (conservation) act. an affidavit filed on behalf of the chief conservator of forests indicated that revenue records had been updated for 88,000 hectares. the court observed that this did not appear to be satisfactory because there still remained a large portion of forest land in respect of which the revenue entries had not been mutated in favour of the government. the court said the progress made by the authorities in updating land records was ""not satisfactory"" and ""special efforts will have to be made to complete the process"". the main chunks of private forest land are in the western districts of thane, alibag, sindhudurg, ratnagiri and raigad. significantly, the court also directed the state to state whether land restored to farmers retained the character as reserved forest or had been put to non-forest use. the matter will be heard on december 10. in the meantime, the district collectors have been directed not to issue any certificates without the prior permission of the central government stating that the land acquired was not forest land to begin with. the collectors were also directed to initiate proceedings for the cancellation of all such certificates issued in violation of the forest (conservation) act, 1980.

2,HC upholds MBBS entry rule for BCs,"hyderabad: a full bench of the a p high court comprising chief justice b. sudershan reddy and justice v v s rao on tuesday upheld the interpretation on rule reservation for backward classes while making admission to mbbs i year course. the sliding rule provided that a candidate who had taken a payment seat could slide into a seat reserved for bc candidates in the non-payment category. the resultant vacancy is filled up another candidate of the same category. this action was challenged. the same bench by a majority view upheld the interpretation relating to admission to engineering courses. in his minority view the chief justice said, law must move forward but the creative and dynamic interpretative rule of this court should not be extended to the extent of delaying the benefit statutory rules to one section students at the cost of others. voicing the majority view justices v v s rao said,the supreme court has considered the principle and categorically laid down the resultant vacant seat by operation of sliding rule must necessarily go to a candidate belonging to the received category. he added, law (laid by supreme court) is binding on the courts, including this court. such a situation the endeavour the high court should be to guide its adjudicative process in line with the law laid down by the supreme court.

4,HC serves notice on HRD minister Joshi,"allahabad: allahabad high court directed union hrd minister mm joshi and his departmental secretary m k kaw to show cause by december 10, why proceedings be not initiated against them for committing contempt of court, by allowing one bela chatterjee to continue as the officiating director of the agra based central hindi teaching institute. chti ran into a legal minefield after prof mahabir sharma retired from the office as director on january 31. kaw, on the basis of joshi's order, appointed ms chatterjee as chti's officiating director until a regular incumbent was appointed through the prescribed selection process. the chti is among seven regional institutes being by the union hrd ministry. however, ms chatterjee's appointment was a clear departure from norms. the rules lay down that whenever a director takes superannuation, the senior-most professor would be designated as the officiating director until a regular director took over. prof rv singh, who heads the chti tribal language research and natural production unit, was the first to be piqued over ms chatterjee's elevation. by the virture of being the seniormost professor, he was an automatic choice. since rules had been violated, prof singh filed a petition at the allahabad high court, challenging the legality of ms chatterjee appointment. a division bench, consisting justice s r singh and justice d r chaudhary, passed an order on august 16, quashing ms chatterjee appointment as officiating director. both joshi and kaw were directed by the bench to authorise the petitioner prof ram veer singh to continue subject to the condition that he would continue on the post till the availability of a regular selected candidate for directorship of the institute. ms chatterjee continues to function as officiating director, usually from delhi, prof singh alleged in a contempt petition filed few days back at the high court. by not giving me the charge of officiating director of the institute and allowing ms bela chatterjee to continue working in that capacity, both the respondents, dr joshi and mr kaw have violated the judicial verdict of the high court and were thus guilty of having committed contempt of court, he said. justice r k agrawal, entertaining his plea, issued notice to both the respondents, directing them to show cause by december 10.

5,Municipal election process gets going,"pune:the process for conducting the pune municipal corporation (pmc) general elections in 146 wards, including the 38 fringe villages, kicked off on tuesday, notwithstanding the opposition by local congress leaders. the much-awaited draws for earmarking the reservations in the 146 wards which will go to the polls on february 10, 2002, were conducted by the pmc election office on tuesday. the congressmen, led by minister of state for public works department balasaheb shivarkar and mla chandrakant chhajed, have objected to the process and demanded that the state government cancel the draws since the fringe villages which will be voting will be delinked from the corporation by the time the civic elections are held. according to the draws drawn on tuesday, as many as 49 of the total 146 wards have been reserved for women. this includes 28 wards which have been reserved for women from the open category, 13 for other backward classes (obc), seven for scheduled castes (sc) and one for women from schedule tribes (st). of the remaining 97 wards, 57 wards will remain open for the general category, 26 for obcs, 13 for scs and one for sts. the pmc has formed 48 panels, 46 comprising three wards each and two comprising four wards each. the general notion that each of the 48 panels will have at least one ward open for the general category was also proved wrong during the draws which were conducted through a lottery system.there are five panels wherein all the wards have been reserved for one category or the another. they are: panel number 2 (kalas-dhanori), 9 (golf club), 16 (wanowrie-mohhamedwadi), 35 (salisbury park) and 45 (nehru stadium). this effectively means that the fate of all the political aspirants, belonging to the open category from these five panels, that is 15 wards, has been ruined. they cannot contest the elections as not a single ward in the panel has been left open. and as the reservations were drawn at the hands of children, they cannot even complain of partiality. the only consolation is that one ward in all the five panels has been reserved for women from the open category. hence an aspirant can bargain for a party ticket for his wife. ironic though it may seem, according to the draws, there are 14 panels wherein two wards each have remained open for the general category!

6,Walkout over farmers' suicides,"thiruvananthapuram: the marxist-led opposition left democratic front (ldf) on tuesday staged a walkout in the kerala assembly in protest against the government's refusal to admit an adjournment motion on the suicides committed by 29 debt-ridden farmers following the crash in the prices of agricultural commodities. opposing the admissibility of the motion, sought to be moved by kodiyeri balakrishnan (cpi-m) and others, agriculture minister k r gouri amma said it was not correct to say that all the 29 farmers committed suicide due to inability to repay the agricultural loans borrowed from banks. in some cases, the cause of suicide was different and not the debt trap. however, the situation facing the agriculture sector was alarming. the government did view the situation very seriously and wanted to help the farmers sincerely. the loss to kerala due to the crash in the prices of cash crops was estimated at rs 6545 crore. pointing out that it was not possible for the state government alone to circumvent the situation, she said pressure would be continued to be exerted on the centre for more reliefs to the farmers. the state government had already requested the centre to declare kerala as a ''calamity-affected area'' so that the farmers could get their loans rescheduled by the banks.

7,Rights activists plan stir against terror law,"kozhikode: human rights activists in kerala, led by eminent jurist v r krishna iyer, on tuesday sharply criticised the prevention of terrorism ordinance (poto) and decided to launch an agitation against it. terming it as a new version of the `draconian' tada, iyer said in a statement here that the stubborn stand of the government to go ahead with the proposed law, despite being short of numbers to get it passed in parliament, gave rise to fears that it would be misused. ``it will be misused to silence the critics and target the minorities in the line of the recent ban on simi,'' he said. the existing laws were adequate and they should only be effectively enforced, he argued. as there is no international definition for terrorism, any critic or opponent could be painted as a terrorist and be targetted. ``under the pretext of war and terrorism, the rulers are trying not only to deny civil rights but also basic human rights,'' he said. the people's union for civil liberties (pucl) and association for human rights (ahr), in collaboration with other like-minded bodies, have decided to launch an agitation against poto. iyer is the chief patron of both these organisations. as part of the agitation, a mass convention would be held in thiruvananthapuram on november 30 under the aegis of the anti-imperialist forum and conventions would be held in malappuram, kozhikode and other places to convince the people about the dangers posed by the ordinance.

8,'Vajpayee govt seems set to last 5 years',"thiruvananthapuram: ""i am afraid the centre may complete the full term"", remarked congress leader k karunakaran. speaking to the times of india, at his residence, he said the thought of the bjp-led coalition completing five years depressed him. ""but it seems the reality"", he said. what was his rationale? ""firstly, there is no viable alternative visible as of now. secondly, no single leader has emerged a concensus candidate"", he observed. karunakaran disagreed with the suggestion that the opposition lacked expertise in the number game. ""it is not the quantum, it is the leadership issue"", he said. ""i have talked to many leaders on this score, they all made it clear that they wholeheartedly supported the congress, but of the leader, the response is varied."" fondly recalling ""my leader"" indira gandhi's ability in breaking or making governments at her will, karunakaran regretted that there was no equal to her in indian politics today. ""it is tragic because the nation needs congress leadership in these difficult times"". the disarray in the opposition was giving the central dispensation the run of the field, he said.

9,Kidnap relived: `Raj plea tied govt's hands',"bangalore\chennai: it's a year after the release of kannada megastar rajkumar and his fellow hostage nagesh from 108 days of captivity from sandalwood smuggler veerappan. karnataka's former dgp c. dinakar, who was at the helm during the kidnap is now blaming rajkumar himself for the ``lack of action'' on the part of the police in capturing veerappan or in his rescue. he told the times of india on tuesday that the actor's ``inconsolable pleading for rescue'' in the cassettes sent by veerappan, had tied the hands of the police who were ``ready'' to raid the brigand's hideout in talawadi, of which they were aware. ``in the cassettes rajkumar threatened to commit suicide if nothing was done to rescue him, '' dinakar contended, adding that chief minister s.m. krishna and everyone else involved in the kidnap-crisis were aware of this. rajkumar's son raghavendra was indignant about this portrayal of his father. ``he is not that kind of person. it was only because of his insistence that we did our best to maintain peace in the state. you think it would not have been easy to ignite fires here?'' he asked. raghavendra maintained that rajkumar's family, on the thespian's directions, had done everything to ensure that linguistic disharmony did not hit karnataka. ``in every situation, there is a 20 per cent error margin and that is all we can be accused of. we should be given credit for the positive things we did,'' he added. official emissary nakkeeran editor r.r. gopal, meanwhile, mocked the police attempts to capture veerappan. ``veerappan cannot be caught. he knows how to escape, the terrain is against the stf and advantageous to veerappan,'' he maintained. tamil nationalist movement leader p. nedumaran, who is credited with convincing veerappan to part with his prize hostage, said the problem was still being addressed from the wrong perspective. advocating amnesty for the brigand, he said: ``i have repeatedly told the authorities not to treat this as a law and order problem, but as a socio-economic problem. more than rs 300 crore have been spent on anti-veerappan operations. why can't such money be utilised to help the people in the area?'' bangalore-based transporter a.p. shanmugasundaram, who is reported to have brought nedumaran into the rajkumar kidnap issue, said the karnataka government had fulfilled only one of the promises it had made to secure the thespian's release. ``they set up the trial court for the tada detenus and over 100 of them have been found innocent by the court. but other promises like the rs 5 crore fund for the victims of stf authorities, the lifting of the stay on the sadashiva commission and the unveiling of the thiruvalluvar statue have not happened,'' shanmugasundaram rued. but karnataka's home minister mallikarjun m. kharge had the last word: `` the stf will give better results this time. we have given them various incentives. they are on the nab-veerappan job now with a new vigour.''

10,Appease ministers or get transferred,"jamshedpur: yesterday once more. bureaucrats continue to face the same old music in the new state of jharkhand. heads roll. officers get bundled out ostensibly for not dancing to the tune of the political masters. some of the ias and ips officers of the state feel the transfer game has only gotten worse in one year of babulal marandi's rule. the problem is not so much with the chief minister himself. it's the alliance partners and ministers apparently keen on transfer and posting. they have been allegedly forcing the transfer of senior officers coming in their way. so the former west singhbhum deputy commissioner, rajiv ranjan ekka, was shunted out allegedly following tiff with joba majhi, tourism, women and child welfare minister. the rss, too, was unhappy with ekka. pradeep kumar, former deputy commissioner of palamu, was eased out after locking horns with assembly speaker and janata dal (united) leader, inder singh namdhari. kumar had crossed swords over anti-encroachment drive in namdhari's hometown, daltonganj. worse, former energy secretary r.s. poddar was tossed around from one department to another. from energy department he was transferred as santhalpargana commissioner, director srikrishna administrative training institute and eventually to social welfare department. poddar was at loggerheads with energy minister lalchand mahato over formation for the state electricity board. mahato even scored over former electricity board rajib ranjan, who had to step down following a high court directive. a host of other officers had to pay the price for not toeing the line of different ministers. even the officers under bihar administrative service have been shifted from one place to another. their transfer makes no sense, informed sources. the transfer cycle has increased, a police officer laments. things are worse than they were during the laloo regime. we didn't have so many ministers flocking to get their job done. laloo had kept them under check. in jharkhand, even bjp ministers don't hesitate in blackmailing the ragtag government. busy playing musical chair, the government seems to have forgotten about the salaries of the ips officers in the newly created districts. it has not yet granted the drawing and disbursing power to the officials.

11,CM sorry for rushing through terror law,"kolkata: chief minister buddhadeb bhattacharjee was guilty of being a man in a hurry. in his rush to crack down on organised crime, he slipped up and did not consult cpm and the left front, before drafting the 'prevention of organised crime ordinance' through the cabinet. on wednesday, bhattacharjee said, sorry, to his colleagues at the left front meeting for the omission. explaining that he had been desperate to extend the time limit for submitting chargesheet against the arrested from the present three months to six months, he said that the deadline in the khadim abduction case was drawing near and he was anxious to ensure that those who were arrested remained behind bars. it was decided that the chief minister would unofficially hand over the draft of poco along with that of poto to the left front constituents. the front would compare the two drafts and formulate its opinion before it was placed in the assembly for enactment. i should have discussed the matter in the left front first , bhattacharjee said candidly to pacify other partners of the front who had been furious at the manner the front had been kept in the dark, in fact ignored, about the issue. even i was not aware of the matter, admitted left front chairman biman bose indicating that even the cpm state secretariat had similarly been kept in the dark. i came to know of it from newspapers, bose said. the chief minister was kind enough to admit this during the front meeting, bose told reporters later. the front chairman, however, tried to disprove fears that poco was not as repressive as the prevention of terrorism ordinance introduced by the centre. the poco has no provision to take repressive measures against the common people. poto and poco are different, bose claimed. those who are opposing it, have not read the draft, he said.
