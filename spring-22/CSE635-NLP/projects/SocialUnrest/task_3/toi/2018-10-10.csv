3,State government hikes court fees,"mumbai: the ruling democratic front (df) government has effected a steep hike in the court fee charges and increased the maximum fee to rs 3 lakh from the earlier rs 75,000. petitioners to the industrial and labour courts, who were earlier exempted from the court fees, will have to shell out an ``exorbitant'' amount in court fees following the maharashtra government's decision last month. legal experts claim that the delivery of justice will be expensive and out of the bounds for the commoners following the state government's move to revise court fees. people keen on filing writ petitioner will now have to shell out rs 250 towards fees as against the earlier rs 100, while the charges of filing an affidavit has been hiked three-times over from rs five to rs 15. fees for the vakalatnama too have been increased from rs 3 to rs 10 and the rates for obtaining the each certified copy have gone up from rs 2 to rs 10. the decision to revise the court fee charges was taken by the state cabinet in september and an ordinance was promulgated by the governor p.c. alexander making amendments to the bombay court fee act. the new court fees have come into effect from october 1. the legal fraternity, however, claims that the hike was ``unjustified and invalid and will make the delivery of justice an expensive affair''. ``the worst sufferers will be the common man who just about manages to pool funds to seek justice in the courts. if a person approaches the court for settlement of his property dispute he will have to shell out a huge amount which may be upto rs three lakh just towards the court fees. this will only discourage people from going to the court,'' mahendra bajpai, a practising lawyer in the high court said. ``the court fees charge are exactly in proportion to the judicial services rendered to the people. it is not a tax but a fee charged by the government for running the legal establishment and if the government has decided to increase this fee it should explain how best it can improve the delivery of justice for the people,'' advocate bajpai said. noted legal hawk m.p. vashi said, ``it is one of closing the doors on the litigants by saying that the state does not have funds to run the huge establishment''. mr vashi has slapped a notice on the state government seeking an explanation for the hike in the court fees. repeated attempts to contact law and judiciary minister vilas patil proved futile.

""had help from the police or fire-fighting units come, we could have saved at least some of our belongings, but now we are on the streets and we don't know where to go. because of help from some neighbours we dared to jump out. they stood outside our house to catch us. otherwise we would have been charred to death,"" she said still visibly distraught.

6,'NDA govt delaying women's Bill',"dharamsala:chandresh kumari, the president of the all-india mahila congress and rajya sabha member said here on tuesday that the nda government at the centre was misleading women on the issue of the women reservation bill. talking to media persons, she said the nda government was not serious about presenting the bill in parliament and to delay it it had referred it to a select committee. she said that instead of sending it to a select committee it could have been debated in parliament itself to elicit the views of political parties. she admitted that there were some contradictions within the congress party also regarding the quota within quota proposal for reserved category women, including obcs. she said the congress, which had introduced 33 per cent reservation for women at the panchayat level was committed to implementing the same in state assemblies and parliament. she said the experiment at the panchayat level had not yielded the desired results at the panchayat level as, at that level, women were not fully conversant with the methodology of governance. she said that with this in mind the congress had launched a training programme for women in 14 states to train them in governance at the panchayat level. speaking on state politics she said that in case the congress won the next assembly elections, due in 2003,virbhadra singh would be a strong contender for the post of chief minister since he was a mass leader. regarding factionalism in the party, she said that had been blown out of proportion and virbhadra was doing his job of clp leader efficiently while vidya stokes, the pcc president, was discharging hers well. she said that as far as her candidature for the next elections was concerned, she would prefer to contest the assembly election from the dharamsala assembly segment if the party gave her the opportunity. she regretted that the mp area development funds was not optimally utilised and the credit for the money spent on the schemes was hogged by the state government ignoring t he contribution of the respective member of parliament.

11,Modi asks BJP workers to help improve party image,"ahmedabad: chief minister narendra modi on monday called upon partymen to keep away from ""manthara"" type characters as they were more dangerous than ravan, who represented evil in epic ramayana. addressing the first meeting of party workers at the bjp headquarters here, modi did some plain-speaking and exhorted them to distance themselves from critics within the organisation more than those outside, because insiders could prove more harmful. as disciplined soldiers, he said, they should not fall into traps laid by vested interests _ and run here and there for transfers _ as such elements tarnished the image of the party. he said he was sent to gujarat to refurbish the image and the sagging morale of party workers by establishing rapport which he had received during his tenure as organising secretary few years ago. ""i am passing through a critical period of my life and seek your support in this difficult task of chief ministership, which could not be accomplished without you help."" modi said the active worker was the engine full of power for any political party, and in no circumstances should he be ignored. he was crucial for the interface between the party and the people. the bjp cannot afford complacency on the part of workers as they alone could spread the message of programmes and policies of the government.

12,Pinch-hitter Modi sets scorching pace of work,"gandhinagar: he is undoubtedly a man in a hurry. if elections are held in march 2003, he has even worked out that he has some 2000 working hours to deliver the goods for the bjp. he is like a cricket captain for whom it is not a 50-over game but a more specific 300-ball opportunity. the cricketing parallel is not out of the blue. now three days into office, chief minister narendra modi had declared on his return to gujarat that he is here to play a one-dayer, not a five-day test match. and officialdom is already feeling the heat as the new chief minister has set a scorching pace of work. gone are the '7 hours at a stretch' meetings which his predecessor used to hold, discussing how to remove the rubble in kutch which used to amble along at a leisurely pace and often leave the officials trying to stifle a big yawn. on tuesday, he had two meetings -- on the narmada project and earthquake relief -- each lasting for about 90 minutes. ""he was specific and to the point, he wanted to be briefed on the issues beforehand rather than going into the meeting blank,"" said an official of the newly reconstituted cmo. tuesday was also the day for meeting public representatives. the stream of visitors, which began around 1 pm, continued till late. insiders say modi's day begins around 5 am. almost immediately, he logs on to the internet and surfs through a lot of current affairs sites. by this time, a close aide has already down-loaded from the net and taken print-outs of news reports concerning the new chief minister. ""he just can't want for the newspapers to be brought to him, he has already inquired why the newspapers reach gandhinagar so late."" so the information department has already arranged for an early morning drop of a huge bunch of newspapers to be delivered at his door by 6 am. and unlike keshubhai patel, who used to take just a cursory look at the local dailies and wait for his officials to brief him about what has appeared in the english newspapers, modi pores over papers, which now a days are full of him. his interaction with people and party workers begins around 8 am at his residence. the message to the staff is quite clear that the new cm would like to be as accessible as possible. even the cmo, where modi reaches sharp at 10.30 am, follows this principle. ""after coming to office, he spends about 15 minutes with the staff of cmo trying to know about his programme for the day and get a briefing on specific issues scheduled during the next few hours"", said a cmo official. the brisk pace that he has set was evident on sunday itself when a few hours after the swearing-in, he re-constituted the cmo. his advisers have been at work for the whole of last week working on a new team of officials he has to work with. and even while the cm was addressing a meeting of senior secretaries and the media on monday afternoon, the goose had been cooked for several officials who, the new chief minister believes, are tainted. they were shunted to postings which, in bureaucratic terms, are known as 'kala pani'. the it-savvy chief minister has already held a round of video-conferencing with district collectors who were woken up early on monday morning to be told to come face-to-face with the chief minister. and indications are that modi may visit kutch before he proceeds to new delhi for getting clearance for his cabinet expansion. before going to delhi, he has convened a meeting of officials to discuss what are the issues that are pending with the centre. a senior bureaucrat, commenting on the frenetic pace set by modi, couldn't help point out that he has a 25-year age difference with his predecessor. ""this man is clearly a pinch-hitter coming at the fag end of the innings when the asking run rate has really soared high,"" said the official.

14,Shivakumar blames Gowda for violence,"bangalore: cooperation minister d.k. shivakumar on wednesday rejected the opposition parties demand for his resignation in the wake of tuesday's violence in vittalenahalli in channapatna taluk in which two persons were killed in police firing, and alleged that the family members of former prime minister h.d. deve gowda were responsible for it. addressing a news conference, he said the demand that his action should be included in the terms of reference of the judicial inquiry was nothing but a ploy to seek his resignation. the violence occurred when hundreds of tappers on the bangalore-mysore highway near channapatna were protesting against the government's neera policy. ""the charges are baseless and politically motivated. the demand that my action should be included in the terms of references is to force me to resign. i will not oblige such demands,"" he said. shivakumar charged gowda with resorting to politics by not allowing the final rites to be performed for the person killed in the violence. ""the tata sumo damaged in the violence belongs to a jd (s) leader. the judicial inquiry should probe into why the sub-inspector used the tata sumo of jd(s),"" he said, refusing to name the leader. the minister also accused gowda and his family members of trying to defame him in his constituency. ""i have been elected for three terms and have been representing sathnur for 15 years. after the elections to the karnataka milk federation in which former minister h.d. revanna was a candidate, the family has been trying to evolve ways and means of defaming me. they cannot succeed,"" he said. the results of the kmf elections have been stayed by the high court.

15,"Poll fixing? Yes, the ministers did exactly that!","bangalore: what have osama_bin-laden, pandiri_bai, musiri_krishnamurthy, aishwarya_rai, devadeva, pa_pu_papu, hunkyhunk and jane jane...have in common? they are all, believe it or not, the email ids of a particular minister's fan club members. to us, it all added up to one big load of joke (junk) mail. when we asked our readers to rate the krishna government on the eve of its second birthday, we did not quite expect the bash we got. the responses came in their thousands, they poured in by emails, letters and faxes. among them, many hundred stood unitedly for one minister and equally unitedly against another, united in content, form and handwriting too. who could have imagined that the 'glory' of being named 'the best minister' by the times of india, could move the honourable members of the krishna cabinet to such heights of social activism as providing part-time employment to hundreds of out-of-work party workers. sure, casting an e-vote or shooting off faxes at the behest of your political boss may not beat the excitement of cracking the ministerial whip; but when you are jobless every scrap counts. bravo ministers for showing such fine team spirit. however, apart from being a good opportunity for ministers to demonstrate inter-personal camaraderie, provide some revenue to the telephone department (all those faxes would have cost money) and jobs to unemployed congressmen, the poll was a huge success in other respects too. it, for instance, reflected how much our leaders mean to our readers, or should we say how less. for many, this government has just one name and face and that is s.m. krishna, the others don't exist. if there is a message in the confused verdict on who is the best/worst minister it is right here: wake up, get proactive or be consigned to oblivion. indeed, the votes were so fragmented, uncertain and erratic that there seemed little point naming anyone for either of the two honourable positions of best and worst. so we left it at that.

18,KoPT armed with new land policy,"kolkata: the kolkata port trust (kopt) has finally adopted its new land policy. the kopt board recently passed the new resolution and has send it to the ministry of shipping for approval. the unused land under kopt will be alloted for a period of 99 years on recovery of the entire value of the land as 'upfront premium' with a token rent of re 1 per square metre annually. in other words, the kopt, from now on, will lease out land for 99 years instead of 15 years, as is the practice now. the kopt has around 1,700 acres of land in kolkata which is not used for port operation. they are either rented out to various industrial units for commercial, storage and industrial use (who do not pay rent according to the amount fixed by the trust) or leased out for a period of 15 years. however, if the same land is leased out for 99 years, it will fetch the kopt a one-time income of rs 54 crore from the city. the price of land is estimated at rs 2.25 lakh to rs 2.50 lakh per cottah in the dock area and rs 10 lakh per cottah in the port canal area near majherhat. the kopt has hired a consultant for the final valuation of land. haldia, which has 6,300 acres of such unused land, will fetch an additional amount. the idea is to create a pension fund of rs 1,500 crore for the huge number of retired kopt personnel. unfortunately, places in kolkata selected for land lease have not evoked an encouraging response from buyers. out of the 10 spots selected by the kopt, only three have received a favourable response from interested parties which, together, can fetch kopt not more than rs 4 crore. these sites are helen keller sarani, taratala road and kantapur. but the response is not encouraging in places like brace bridge and paharpur, where the area available is larger. in these places, the lease period may be reduced to 30 years on recovery of four years' rent as premium and monthly rate as quoted by the party. according to kopt sources, one reason why the spots have failed to get good response is that these areas have to be leased out and cannot be sold.
