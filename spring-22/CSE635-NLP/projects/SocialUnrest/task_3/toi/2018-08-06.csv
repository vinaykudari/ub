0,"BJP adopts cautious approach to Sabarkantha, Sabarmati by-polls","ahmedabad: the ruling bharatiya janata party has adopted a cautious approach to next month's by-elections for the sabarkantha lok sabha and sabarmati assembly seats. this warinessness come from the fact that the tribal-dominated sabarkantha is a congress stronghold, and capturing it will be an uphill task for the bjp. the bjp's has kicked off its campaign by holding a two-day meeting of senior leaders at khedbrahma. the meeting was addressed by national president jana krishnamurthy. last month, chief minister keshubhai patel has addressed two major public functions in the constituency. senior ministers have been asked to undertake visits to establish more rapport with the electorate. the bjp, this time around, is discreet about evolving a poll strategy and selecting candidates. this by-election will a litmus test for the bjp, which suffered a severe drubbing in the last civic and panchyat elections. ""we will give final touches to poll planks and select candidates only after the bye-election schedule is announced by the election commission of india,"" a senior party leader observed. state planning commission deputy chairman sooryakant acharya and some other select party functionaries particularly who could influence adivasis have been assigned the canvassing job in the constituency. the frontal organisations like the rss and the vhp have already made their presence felt but in a quiet and effective manner. it is learnt that the bjp would swing into action once it was certain about the choice of rival candidates. if the congress fielded a tribal nominee, the bjp would have to give serious consideration to put up a more influential candidate in the constituency. the bye-election has been necessitated due to death of nishaben chaudhary wife of amarsinh chaudhary. the bjp has ruled out the possibility of former gujarat chamber of commerce and industries president utkarsh shah as a nominee for sabarmati assembly constituency. the bjp is harping on the achievements of the keshubhai patel ministry. these include laying of saurashtra pipeline, revival package for mmcb and a tax-free budget presented for the third consecutive year by finance minister vajubhai vala.

1,'Allow anganwadi to contest panchayat polls',"hyderabad: the state committee of the cpm has demanded that the state government withdraw its orders, issued on saturday, making anganwadi workers and helpers ineligible to contest the gram panchayat elections. ""the orders (go ms no 23) issued on the last day of filing nominations is against the election code of conduct as well as the court judgments on the panchayat elections,"" cpm state secretary bv raghavulu said here on sunday. the contentious go ms no 23 aims at deleting clause ii in go ms no 7 (march 7, 1996) of the women development and child welfare department, which permits anganwadi workers and helpers to hold elected posts such as sarpanch and mptc member. the order was issued in response to a clarification sought by the state election commission (sec) secretary, as permitting anganwadi workers/helpers to hold elected posts was not in conformity with section 18 (1) of ap panchayat raj act, 1994. raghavulu said the party would write a letter to the sec and also approach the high court as the latest go was in contravention to the court's orders. the court had directed the government to permit anganwadi workers to contest the elections in response to a petition filed by cpm on the non-implementation of orders permitting anganwadi workers to contest the polls in some districts, he said. he criticised the government for adopting, `double standards' on issues pertaining to anganwadi workers. ""when the workers demand a hike in pay, the government claims that they are not its employees and are working on honorarium. but when it comes to permitting them to contest the elections, the government makes them ineligible by putting them on par with government staff,"" he said. he urged the sec to permit those anganwadi workers and helpers who have filed nominations to contest the polls. the centre for indian trade unions (citu), the trade union wing of cpm, too criticised the state government for issuing the orders. ""the orders issued on the last day of filing nominations only reflect the ruling telugu desam party's fears regarding the forthcoming elections to gram panchayats,"" citu general secretary s veeraiah said. the cpm has also decided to distribute pamphlets outlining the ill-effects of reforms introduced by the present government in power, irrigation and other sectors, raghavulu added.

2,Unanimity at polls impossible in Warangal,"warangal: unanimity at the gram panchayat hustings seems an impossible task in warangal district in spite of the fact that the administration has offered sops and concessions to the villages choosing sarpanches without any contest. less than 10 villages, that too the ones reserved for scheduled tribes and women, have chosen candidates unanimously during the current polls. in the elections held in 1994, about 85 villages of a total of 983 gram panchayaths in warangal district had elected their sarpanches without any contest. twenty-five villages had boycotted the election process then, while among the 85, 30 chose their sarpanches at the instance of naxalite groups. the gram panchayat elections being on a non-party basis has led to political groups keeping away from the election exercise for now. but the atmosphere created during the recent mptc and zptc polls has provided the scope for the parties to enter indirectly. in warangal, the three prime contenders at the zptc polls -- tdp, congress and trs -- have entered the fray in a majority of the panchayats going to the polls. even in the areas where naxalites hold sway, a keen contest is on the cards. leaders representing the political parties say that they are promoting the candidatures of their chosen nominees for strengthening the party base at the village level. in the jangaon and warangal revenue divisions, where the polling is scheduled on august 14, electioneering has also picked up even before the completion of the nomination deadline. in the cherial segment, the nominees supported by the tdp are trying hard to make a mark after the party suffered serious losses at the zp polls recently. says seetharama rao of maddur mandal, ""earlier, there was scope for unanimous elections in this part even in the form of open auction system as a result of which three villages here were grabbed by the existing sarpanches in auctions. but this time, the auction pattern is unlikely because political rivalry is very fresh after the zptc and mptc elections."" rao says as a result, his village and the neighbouring ones will see a multi-cornered contest. in karimnagar district, the situation is the same and a majority of the 1,000 odd gram panchayaths will see sharp political divisions.

11,Ifs and buts plague increased college seats,"lucknow: state government's decision to increase the number of seats in under-graduate courses in state universities and degree colleges has been welcomed by the students, their guardians and teachers, but not without skepticism. while for hundreds of candidates who were deprived of admissions this year, the decision came as a ray of hope, lukcnow university and associated colleges' authorities find themselves in a difficult situation. the problem for the latter is that the decision has come after the admission process is over. now they will have to perform the entire exercise all over again, which will delay the academic session, regularised after 25 years, by at least one month. the state government had earlier decided to scrap the evening classes citing reasons that they were responsible for overcrowding of university campus, resulting in law and order problem and deterioration in quality of education. but now, when the education minister, om prakash singh, is out of the country, the chief minister has reversed the decision. lu student's union (lusu) president shailsh singh said ""this was our demand from the beginning. however, what i fail to understand is that if government had to revive the evening classes then why they were scrapped at all. lu spokesman prof sk dwivedi was puzzled too. ""we will place the go before executive council for its decision or decide the course of action as per the wishes of vice-chancellor,"" he said. lu teachers' association described the decision as a mere `political gimmick' for publicity. ""no doubt, it will help thousands of students, but what about the quality of education as it will again spoil the student-teacher ratio,"" said luta joint secretary rb singh. he said that along with the increase in number of seats government should also look into appointing more teachers and providing better infrastructure. the decision means increase of around 10,000 seats in lucknow university and its 22 associated colleges alone. however, teachers' strength will remain the same. which means that the teacher-student ratio would be around 125:1 as against 60:1 prescribed under ugc norms. lu associated college teachers' association (luacta) general secretary moulindu mishra pointed out that quality of education will suffer tremendously. he drew government's attention towards the `one-man departments' in colleges. there is only one teachers to teach 27 subjects in commerce department to over 100 students in mahila college, he said. similarly in national college, education, psychology, english, political science, geography and anthropology have just one teacher each. in same way, economics and aih departments of lucknow christian college, english, political science, aih, economics, education and sanskrit departments of krishna devi college were one-man departments, he added. parents too had their complaints. many had already got their wards admitted in various colleges when they could not get admission to their `first-choice' institutions. ""however, now we will have to try again and pay hefty fees if we want to change and the fee paid earlier would not be refunded,"" said arun prakash, a clerk in indian oil. nevertheless, the students and the guardians are happy that at least they will get another opportunity for education in colleges of their choice.

12,Govt holds fast to no-neera policy,"mysore: karnataka agriculture minister t.b. jayachandra on monday, ruled out relaxation of excise rules to facilitate ``neera'' tapping by the coconut farmers and said, tapping ``neera'' is not a solution to control the mite attack on the coconut groves. at a press meet here, the minister said, some organisations and karnataka rajya raitha sangha (krrs) were making ``wrong claims'' over the issue and the farmers needed to be educated in this regard. he said any permission to tap ``neera'' from coconut trees would have adverse effect on the village economy and farmers' lives. besides, the permission to tap ``neera'' would be against the excise laws and would effect the state revenue as the excise contractors involved in arrack and other liquor business may defy their contract,'' he said . however, the government has asked the cftri to invent a technology to bottle and sell ``neera'' as a soft drink and this may help the farmers in the future. ``apart from this, there is no market for ``neera'' if it is tapped from all the 4.5 crore coconut trees,'' he added. replying to a question, the minister defended the police action on `neera'- tapping farmers and said the government was bound to provide protection to the excise contractors if they approach the police with incidents of neera- tapping from coconut groves. the minister said the state agriculture ministry had geared up itself to tackle the mite attack and for this, the government had sanctioned rs 9 crore for the first round of treatment. ``as per the new plan, the coconut trees will be injected with monocrotophos twice a day, which will be followed by a bacterial pesticide,'' he said. he further said, the state government would give 75 per cent subsidy to farmers who use these pesticides.

21,Physical distinctions blur city roads,"vadodara: ever tried walking in the city? gaining a toe-hold on city roads could pose a challenge to even the most consummate prima ballerina. sanskar nagri has some beautiful monuments, gardens, parks and shopping complexes but few well-constructed footpaths. so, if a citizen wished to walk short distances on foot, the task would be one involving innumerable impediments. one would have to contend with the plethora of encroachments on footpaths, the sheer absence of smooth flooring on them, parked vehicles, garbage dumps, cows and pigs and hawkers. walking in vadodara is a challenge. walking is possible if there are footpaths. in many city areas there are no pavements at all, they are either taken over by parked vehicles or engulfed in road-widening exercises. sometimes one can hardly make out the difference between a shop entrance and the footpath road. in almost all shopping areas in the city, viz. alkapuri's r c dutt road, raopura main road, the m g road, mangal and the nava bazaar, a well-maintained and well constructed footpath is a sight for sore eyes. furthermore, many important crossings on the main roads in the city do not have zebra crossings (near the cross-roads on the rc dutt road, the ever-crowded railway station, st depot and many other city areas). ""it appears that the city's town planners had no provisions at all for pedestrians,"" says smita ruparel a city resident. and ironically enough sources in both vuda and the vmc say that their main concern is construction of roads, pavements are what remains as leftover after the main road (for vehicles) is constructed. ""in some city areas, especially old city areas like mg road, the increasing traffic has forced the authorities to narrow down the footpath,"" said a senior officer in vuda. ""it's a ubiquitous problem in vadodara. when i first came here i wanted to walk around the city to know it better. but when i tried it out, i discovered that it was impossible to walk on footpaths without endangering oneself. i gave up due to uneven roads and opted to use my two-wheeler even for short distances instead,"" says rita upadhyay a resident of navapura. ""my 10-year-old daughter was recently hurt when she went to the market. to avoid a cow coming headlong at her, she moved to the side and in the process sprained her ankle due to the uneven footpath. roads are not safe to walk on, but then nor are our pavements safe,"" she says. according to r trivedi, shopping in alkapuri too is difficult especially if one tries to walk across from one shopping complex to another. ""there are footpaths, but they are uneven. at all places there are hawkers and parked vehicles which makes walking very difficult. this is especially so if we come with our children, we have to be specially careful to ensure they do not sprain their ankles,"" he says. ""there are many tourists, especially foreign tourists, who prefer to walk in the cities they visit, but unlike in other cities most of them avoid walking in vadodara,"" says hitesh desai, who played host to some french tourists. he says, ""if a person tries to walk for example from the majestic kirti mandir towards the baroda museum and picture gallery in sayajibaug, he would have to walk on the road where hawkers have encroached upon the pavement. further down this road one has to cross the vishwamitri bridge where pedestrians have to walk on a narrow lane which has a huge pipe taking over the pedestrian walk. the footpath that was constructed on this bridge during the gaekwad era has been converted into a road for two-wheelers. this leaves absolutely no place for pedestrians to walk,"" he complains. according to him this is the case even on the periphery of the historic sursagar lake and the majestic nyay mandir where footpaths are uneven and taken over by parked vehicles, hawkers and cattle. where the problem lies: * encroachments on footpaths. * cattle and garbage heaps leave no place for pedestrians to walk on. * vehicles parked on footpath. * lack of zebra crossings at main cross-roads in the city. * badly laid footpaths. in line of fire: k k shah vuda chairman: there are plans made to construct roads in the city. these follow certain guidelines. there are specifications for the width of the pavement of the roads. but per se there is no plan for a pavement alone. sometimes the pavements in the city are damaged and uneven and can injure a person walking on them. but the repair and maintenance of footpaths is the responsibility of the vadodara municipal corporation. who to complain vmc's complaint cell: 434216 madan jhampa road is virtually taken over by shopkeepers who display their wares. such a sight is common to the entire city.
