1,"Interim budget anti-farmer, says CM","FAZILKA: Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh, on Saturday, criticised the Bhartiya Janta Party-led NDA government for giving ''step-motherly'' treatment to Punjab.

Demanding Central government''s assistance on the pattern of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) and Himachal Pradesh (HP), the chief minister, while addressing a Congress rally at Government MR College ground here, severely flayed the interim-budget presented recently by finance minister Jaswant Singh.

Calling it an anti-farmer and anti-labour class budget, he said it has been designed to woo big industrial houses and traders. He demanded that Fazilka, Hussainiwala, Amritsar and Gurdaspur borders be opened to facilitate trade.

The chief ministerfurther declared that 12,700 villages in the state would start getting regular supply of electricity within six months.

Earlier, Amarinder laid down a foundation stone of a sewerage project linking Civil Lines with the town and a water treatment plant.

Both the project would be completed at an estimated cost of Rs 2.80 crore, said Sewerage Board officials.

2,Old grudge led to murder of woman lawyers,"HYDERABAD: An old grudge reportedly led to the gruesome murder of two woman advocates â€” N Swarnakumari and K Satyavathi â€” on Friday, police said here on Saturday.

Three persons have been arrested. Blood-stained clothes, weapons, gold and silvery jewellery were also recovered from them.

The arrested have been identified as A Prashanth Kumar (27), K Raghavender Reddy alias Raghu (23) and M Raju (19), all residents of Moosarambagh.

Disclosing this to newsmen, Cyberabad police commissioner M Mahender Reddy said police could crack the case within 24 hours based on a tip-off about the car the accused had used to execute the murder.

He said Prashanth Kumar paid Rs 30,000 to Swarnakumari to get him bail in a murder case. However, she reportedly did not get him the bail. Later, he employed the services of another advocate and got himself bail, the officer said.

Prashanth bore a grudge against Swarnakumari as she used to insult and abuse him whenever he demanded his money. Unable to bear the insult and her failure to get him a bail, he decided to eliminate her.

3,HRD minister's shadow over SGPGI too,"LUCKNOW: After the controversy over the IITs and IIMs, even SGPGI doctors feel that the ""HRD minister MM Joshi seems to be in the habit of rubbing the intelligentsia the wrong way"".

His attitude over the Centre for Biomedical Magnetic Resonance (CBMR) at SGPGI has raked up yet another controversy. Even as there are indications that either the state government will allot a 1-2 acre plot for the centre and will hand it over to the University Grants Commission (UGC) or shift it to Allahabad, simultaneously, it is being felt that Joshi was made to believe that the SGPGI was not facilitating ''genuine'' research.

SGPGI doctors, however, feel that just by getting a Rs 20-crore grant a centre cannot be provided the privilege to bypass all rules and regulations which, they allege, the centre in-charge Profesor CL Khetrapal was proposing.

It was only after the present director of SGPGI Dr Kartar Singh reportedly raised objections to the blatant disregard for all rules that the issue was given a twist to serve vested interests, complain doctors.

Objections are being raised over even the validity of Prof Khetrapal''s joining and appointment, as also on the salary he is drawing.

Doctors reveal that Prof Khetrapal was appointed as distinguished professor on February 19, 1998. However, he joined on March 20, 2001 even though he had only been given an extension for joining up to August 7, 1998.

Also, in the pay scale of Rs 7300-7600 (revised Rs 22,400-24,500) in which Prof Khetrapal was appointed, his total emoluments excluding pension comes to Rs 19,736 per month. But his salary was fixed at par with that of the vice-chancellors of state universities, that is Rs 35,000.

In addition to the total salary, he is also reportedly drawing a pension of Rs 10,515, which is against the CSR rule 520 that says that the salary payable to retired government servants plus the pension should not exceed the total last emoluments drawn by the employee.

And, while the approval for his appointment was taken from the president of SGPGI, the facts were reportedly misrepresented, allege doctors. Referring to Prof Khetrapal, the note says: ""He resigned from the Indian Institute of Science (and never retired from that institute)"" and also ""This (means fixed salary of vice-chancellor) pay is in accordance with the UP government rules."" But the fact is that Prof Khetrapal retired from the Indian Institute of Science, say the doctors.

Interestingly, Prof Khetrapal had already completed 65 years on August 24, 2002 and extension beyond 65 years is not permissible as per government rules.

Senior doctors at the SGPGI say that ""irregularities have been knowingly made in the appointment, joining and pay fixation of Prof Khetrapal that need immediate measures including termination of his appointment and recovery of the financial loss incurred by the institute in terms of his pay and other fringe benefits.""

When asked however, Prof Khetrapal claimed that since he was new to the institute he was not aware of the procedure of the SGPGI. It was better to consult the HRD minister. As for whether there were any irregularities in his joining and appointment, he advised to ask either the institute''s past or present director.

However, both the past director Dr Mahendra Bhandari and the present director Dr Kartar Singh could not be contacted. Nor could the HRD minister be contacted.

4,Martial law(lessness) in Pune!,"PUNE: In a blatant abuse of power, around 200 soldiers attached to the Pune Sub-Area command on Saturday dug up a public road in the Sopanbaug area and brutally assaulted civilians protesting against the move, as well as mediapersons who had gone there to cover the incident.

The jawans did not even spare the women folk. Sopanbaug co-operative housing society member Ravi Verma and his wife were manhandled by the soldiers. All this took place in the presence of PMC officials and policemen who did not intervene.

Three press photographers, Shahaji Jadhav (Sakal), Manoj Bidkar (Samna) and Shyam Sonar (Indian Express), and two reporters,Nagraj Naidu (Sakal) and Raosaheb Kamble (Samna) were slapped and kicked around by the troops.

The Pune municipal corporation (PMC) said it had lodged a police complaint against the unidentified troops. The PMC has also decided to file an appeal in the district court on Monday.

There are about 300 families residing at both the Sopanbaug co-operative and the Empress Garden view society using this road, which the army is now trying to block.

5,'Industry burn safety norms are generally poor in India',"LUCKNOW: Although means to facilitate 100 per cent protection from burns exist, hundreds of people die each year and scores of others are crippled due to burn injuries in industrial accidents in the country. Despite safety norms existing, many industries are yet to implement them adequately.

In the unorganised sector, these norms are rarely followed. So much so, that there does not even exist a system for the registration of industrial accidents. Experts in the country now feel that it''s high time the government reviews the industrial acceptance and implementation of safety norms.

Dr Mahtangi Ramakrishnan, a plastic surgeon, has been dealing with burn victims of industrial accidents for the past three decades, and is the only woman in the world to have done a doctorate in science in plastic surgery. Dr Ramakrishnan also runs her own hospital in Chennai. Here in Lucknow to participate in the conference of the National Academy of Burns in India (Nabi), she presented a study of over 39,000 burn patients she has seen over the past 13 years, on Saturday, pointing out that 10 per cent of these injuries have been due to industrial accidents. ""No government agency has any data on burn cases. We collect them from the hospitals where the patients come to for treatment,"" she said, pointing out that she receives 30-40 cases of burn victims from industrial accidents each year.

Since industrialists are ''powerful persons'', the government too is reluctant to take action. Victims, mainly from the poorer labour class, mostly settle for out of court settlements and take whatever compensation is doled out to them, and in return, keep quiet. Unlike burn injuries suffered due to fires, industrial accidents mainly cause chemical, electrical and radioactive burns, which are more dangerous, because they persist for a longer period. ""If not neutralised on time, the chemical, electricity and radioactive burns can even cause damage to the nerves and bones, besides the skin of the victim,"" she pointed out.

Dr Ramakrishnan said that workers at edible oil factories mostly suffer steam high pressure burns due to faulty designs of boilers. They also suffer from inhalation burns causing damage to their internal organs. Workers in cement factory on the other hand, face a threat from alkaline burns; in glass factories the threat of burns is from hydrofluoric acid; in candle factories hot wax can cause deep burns; and electrical burns are common in electrical equipment manufacturing units.

6,Lawyers take to streets to protest rash driving,"HOWRAH: Lawyers staged noisy protest on Saturday morning in Howrah protest against the rash driving of private buses. More than 300 lawyers the Howrah court came out on the street after a colleague was knocked down bus near the court. They blocked the road in front the court for more than two hours, throwing traffic totally out of gear.

The trouble started when bus ran over the leg of Panna Lal Pawli (65). The elderly advocate was waiting for a bus front of the district magistrate''s bungalow, around 11.15 am, when the accident occurred. Two buses on route No. 59 and 55A were trying to overtake each other when the latter knocked Lal down.

Lawyers from the nearby court immediately rushed out on the street on getting the news and stopped the movement of traffic. A large police force had to be deployed to bring the situation under control. The road block was lifted after the police assured them of better traffic monitoring in the area.

The lawyers ceased work for the day in protest against the incident. They alleged that the traffic system Howrah was one of the worst. They demanded better traffic management the area. The injured lawyer admitted at the Howrah General Hospital with serious leg injury.

7,Police chief’s transfer puts govt in poor light,"MUMBAI: By shunting out police commissioner P.S. Pasricha, the Democratic Front government has further sullied its image of playing politics with the police department and the state bureaucracy, say political observers.

Over the years, they add, these two important services have been virtually emasculated by the powers-that-be. Honest bureaucrats have been hounded out, committed law enforcers transferred on specious grounds, and unscrupulous officials placed in lucrative posts with mala fide intentions.

In Mr Pasrichaâ€™s case, a casual phone call from chief secretary Ajit Nimbalkar informed him about his â€˜promotionâ€™ to a boring desk job in the police housing corporation.

Mr Nimbalkar, who is himself on a six-month extension after retirement, was asked by the government to break the news instead of the home department, which controls the police department.

â€œIt is never advisable to change a horse mid-stream. But in Mr Pasrichaâ€™s case, he was not even given enough time to enter the stream,â€™â€™ notes former director-general of police (DGP) Arvind Inamdar.

In 2000, Mr Inamdar was unceremoniously removed as DGP and posted as advisor-cum-director general of police (systems improvement), a virtual demotion. â€œThe very foundation of a state depends on law and order and such transfers send the wrong message down the line,â€™â€™ he adds.

The Maharashtra IAS and IPS cadres are still rated by many as being superior to those from other states. But they are increasingly being viewed as bending to the whims of politicians. The police department, in particular has been shaken by a series of scams, including the cash-for-postings racket that was allegedly institutionalised by a now discredited politician.

Former police chief Ronald Mendonca, for instance, found himself at the receiving end of venal politicians. As the anti-corruption bureau chief, he increased the governmentâ€™s discomfort by trapping public officials who had accepted bribes.

Within no time, he was shunted out as managing director of the Maharashtra Police Housing Development and Welfare Corporation. But unlike Mr Pasricha, he approached the court, won his case and was reinstated.

Sanjiv Dayal, another upright officer, was ordered to go to Naxal-infested Gadchiroli district last year after he attempted to put an end to corruption in the selection of constables in Mumbai. A public uproar forced the government to cancel his posting and he was given charge of the police training school in Nashik, considered to be a side posting.

â€œWithout lobbying, there is no way one can get an executive posting. There are several upright officers who have never been given a chance to handle sensitive jobs,â€™â€™ said controversial IPS officer Y.P. Singh,who wants to quit the police force because of what he terms harassment at the hands of politicians and his superiors.

â€œAs long as a police commissioner manages the transfer industry well, he is allowed to continue. Mr Pasricha seems to have failed in this aspect,â€™â€™ he noted. Upright bureaucrats in Maharashtra are also facing the heat from politicians.

Last year, principal secretary in the food and civil supplies department Neela Satyanarayana was unceremoniously shunted out after she opposed the award of a Rs 10 crore contract to distribute foodgrains to the poor without calling for tenders.

Although there is a growing clamour for an independent body of eminent citizens to ensure transparency in postings and transfers, it was only recently, under pressure from Gandhian Anna Hazare, that the government hurriedly formulated a law. But the proposed legislation is full of holes and still vests a minister with powers to post and transfer officers. Ram

10,Mandir issue raked up with eye on election: Laloo,"BANGALORE: RJD supremo Laloo Prasad Yadav on Sunday accused Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee of raking up the Ram mandir issue again with an ""eye on the coming Lok Sabha elections"".

""The issue now is development and not Mandir"", Yadav here on a brief visit, said referring to Vajpayee''s Saturday''s statement at Faizabad that BJP was committed to building Ram mandir.

He ridiculed the BJP slogan of a ''feel good factor'' as the result of their governance, saying a ''feel bad factor'' was prevailing in the country against the NDA government as it had ''failed'' on all fronts.

""It is only a feel good factor for RSS, Sangh Parivar and BJP and not for people"", he said while criticising the BJP''s new electioneering plank.

""Prices of diesel and petrol are increasing, corruption has exceeded all limits, thousands were killed in Gujarat communal riots, you still call all these a feel good factor?"", Yadav on a day''s visit to Karnataka to attend a convention of the party at Chitradurga, asked while talking to reporters here.

Reiterating his stand that dissolution of Lok Sabha by the NDA government was an ""unconstitutional act"", he questioned, ""where is the need to dissolve the Lok Sabha. It is not in public interest, but in the interest of BJP"".

Yadav said his party was not afraid of elections and declared he would campaign for removing BJP from power. Yadav ruled out his party challenging the government decision to dissolve Lok Sabha in court, saying ""some citizens will do that. I will not spend time in courts"".

He also came down heavily on the NDA government''s advertisement campaign spending more money to impress voters and remarked ""still its (BJP''s) condition is not good.""

Yadav appealed to secular forces in the state to unite to ensure that votes were not divided and termed Karnataka as a secular state. His party would contest one or two Lok Sabha seats in Karnataka, he said.

Turning to the RJD alliance with Congress in Bihar said, he said his party would give ""reasonable number of seats"" to its ally, but did not specify the number.

""They deserve some seats"", he said and added in the last election, five seats were given to Congress and it won two.

Replying to a question, he said he would continue to demand the recall of Governor, Rama Jois, who he alleged had ""failed to perform his constitutional duties"".

He charged BJP with appointing men committed to RSS ideologies as governors of states and having ""degraded the constitutional posts"".

Earlier, addressing a convention of Dalits, BCs and Minorities at Chitradurga, Yadav said the political parties who are partners of NDA had no future in the coming elections and they would split after the polls.

The NDA government had ignored the interest of dalits, backward classes and minorities, he charged.PTI

11,Mulayam criticises Bihar government,"PATNA: The Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister and Samajwadi Party president, Mulayam Singh Yadav, on Sunday criticised the RJD government in Bihar for doing precious little for the development of the state during the past 14 years of its rule.

Addressing a rally here at the historic Gandhi Maidan, Yadav without naming anyone held the present dispensation for the sorry state of affairs in the state.

""No development work has taken place during the 14 years rule of the RJD in Bihar,"" he said.

Yadav said he and other leaders were enlightened by philosophy and leadership quality of late Jaya Prakash Narayan but nothing tangible was done by his followers who are in power in the state to make Bihar a developed state.

He claimed that by bringing in an investment of of over Rs 30,000 crore in Uttar Pradesh during the past three months, ""I have shown to the world any state can progress provided there is will power.""

Yadav, who did not mince words in criticising the president of the RJD without taking the name of its President, Laloo Prasad Yadav, gave ample hints that his party would have no truck with the RJD in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections.

He said that no government could be formed at the Centre without the support of MPs from Uttar Pradesh and added that ""no front could be formed by ignoring the Samajwadi Party which is the single largest party in UP"".

Yadav claimed that the BJP was feeling jittery because of the growing influence of the SP and hence it had decided to have an early Parliamentary election.

""We are not at all bothered by this decision and will perform well at the hustings.""

Yadav spoke about different measures initiated by his government to improve the lot of farmers and said on February 11 a farmer insurance scheme would be launched. Besides the government has also decided to make education totally free upto class eight.
