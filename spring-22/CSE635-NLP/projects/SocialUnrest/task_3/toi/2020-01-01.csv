1,Govt not sincere about nabbing Veerappan: Ponnachi,"BANGALORE: Karnataka''s Special Task Force (STF) is perfectly capable of catching Veerappan, but the state government was the impediment to this, an emissary who met the brigand said on Monday.

Kollegal Janata Dal (U) president Ponnachi A.S. Mahadevaswamy, who met Veerappan on October and 13 in an attempt to secure former minister H. Nagappa''s release, ruled out any help from him to the police to nab the brigand. ""I went in search of my guru Nagappa, not to meet Veerappan. Why should I find him now?"" he told reporters here. Contending that it was the STF which reduced Veerappan''s gang of 150 to ""just three"", Mahadevaswamy said: ""Officers like Shankar Bidari, Kempaiah, Shakeel Ahmed and T. Harikrishna have been very efficient. Even the present STF chief Jyothi Prakash Mirji can catch Veerappan, if the government lets him.""

Mahadevaswamy rued that the government had not made ""even an iota of an effort"" to bring Nagappa out of the brigand''s clutches. ""They had done anything at all, Nagappa would have been back.""

He said the government was also ""not sincere"" about its efforts to uncover the truth about Nagappa''s death. ""All that the government has done is make allegations against me which do not have even one per cent truth,"" he added.

Chief Minister S.M. Krishna was aware of Mahadevaswamy''s efforts to find Nagappa. ""I had informed him. It took me a full month of searching in the forest with information from villagers and JD(U) activists in the area before I found Veerappan, that too by accident, when his henchmen were washing clothes at a water source,"" he said.

The second time he met Veerappan was by design. ""He told me to bring Tamil activist Kolathur Mani.

Or, if Tamil Nationalist Movement President P. Nedumaran (presently in Tamil Nadu''s Cuddalore jail) could have come, the entire problem would have been solved. When I went empty-handed, he was very angry,"" Mahadevaswamy said.

Despite this anger, Veerappan did not kill Nagappa, he maintained. ""I do not know if it was the Karnataka or the Tamil Nadu STF, but it was definitely not Veerappan,"" he said.

Mahadevaswamy denied carrying any ransom for Nagappa. ""Neither was any money paid nor did Veerappan ask for any,"" he stated.

3,Anti-defection law comes into force in Pak,"ISLAMABAD: The fledgling Mir Zafarullah Khan Jamali government in Pakistan faces an uncertain future with the anti-defection law, kept in abeyance by President Pervez Musharraf, coming into force on Wednesday.

The anti-defection law came into effect as Musharraf''s ordinance keeping it in abeyance lapsed last night and was not revived.

After the first meeting of the National Assembly in the third week of November, Musharraf revived the constitutional rule but at the same kept the anti-defection law suspended to enable Jamali to secure majority.

It was only after the anti-floor crossing law was made in-operational that Jamali was elected with majority after 10 of the 81 members of the Pakistan peoples Party headed by former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto voted for him.

The Prime Minister subsequently managed to win the vote of confidence with 16 votes early this week as more PPP members along with members from other parties voted for him allegedly under pressure exerted by the government.

Besides 21 defectors from PPP, two from the Islamist alliance Muthahida Majlis Amal (MMA) and two from the Pakistan Muslim League-N headed by deposed Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif voted for Jamali.

4,Multiplexes double up as party zones,"AHMEDABAD/VADODARA: The drop in temperature, chill winds and nattily dressed youngsters all went to make for a â€˜coolâ€™ New Year party in the state on Tuesday. The state has been looking for reasons to celebrate and purge the agonising memories of the past year, and ushering in â€™03 came as a godsend.

While many headed for farmhouses and private parties, huge crowds thronged the multiplexes, turning them into a vortex around which parties revolved. One of the happening joints in Ahmedabad was the recently opened discotheque at City Pulse, Escape.Though rented out for a private party, it was pulsating with DJ music and a smartly dressed gathering.

Even Fun Republic, one of the bigger multiplexes in the city, managed to put on a decent show. While DJ Jay entertained the crowd, Road-House Blues played some live music. The other multiplexes, R-World and Wide Angle, also attracted substantial crowds with DJs from the city and Mumbai keeping the crowds jiving.

Vadodara too saw the dance floors at its two multiplexes, Inox and Chandan, chock-a-block with energetic youngsters gyrating till midnight.

Like last year, traffic jams were common and many had to struggle to get to party venues. Race Course Circle, that leads to Inox, was full of vehicles. Many had to return without entering the party zone as entry points were jammed with people.

""We went to both Inox and Chandan. Inox was fun as it has a smooth dance floor and the music was good too. Chandan too was fun, but the flooring there was rough for use as a discotheque,"" said Vishakha Patel,nursing a shoe bite from her designer sandals bought specially for the occasion.

Many rued that the fun stopped a few minutes after midnight thanks to the cops who played spoilsport. But most party-hoppers at Chandan headed for the Sindhrot bridge where they danced to music from car audios. Others headed for the city and danced on the streets.

However, not every one saw the New Year as a reason to celebrate. The first few hours of 2003 saw rioting erupt outside LD College of Engineering, resulting in 40 students being arrested.

According to Navrangpura police officials, trouble erupted around 12.10 am over alleged eve-teasing. When a police mobile van reached the spot, an irate mob of youngsters started pelting stones at the policemen. ""The boys who were arrested in this connection were released on Wednesday as they had to appear for exams,"" police sources said.

In some areas of Vadodara too, overzealous revellers forced the police to use force. A minor lathi-charge was reported in Fatehgunj when youngsters started screaming and honking after the new year set in. Officers resorted to some tough steps at Alkapuri and Sayajigunj as well to disperse crowds.

5,State body withdraws petition against govt,"PUNE: Pressure from state cabinet ministers has forced the governmentowned Maharashtra State Sheep and Goat Development Corporation (MSSGDC) to withdraw its petition challenging an order to return its two-acre plot, at Gokhalenagar here, to its original owners. The order to return the plot where its headquarters stands today had been issued by state revenue minister Ashok Chavan.

The MSSGDC had challenged Chavanâ€™s decision to allot land at survey no. 98/2/A, Bhamburda, to its original owners and obtained a stay order from justices V.G. Palshikar and Nisha Mhatre (TOI, March 29) of the Bombay high court. This irked Chavanâ€™s ministerial colleagues because, Chavanâ€™s decision was based on a government resolution to return land acquired from scheduled caste (SC) and scheduled tribe (ST) communities, which were lying unused.

Confirming the withdrawal of the petition, P.L. Kakade said, the corporation has urged Chavan to reconsider the decision and the latter had agreed to consider its request. An MSSGDC employee revealed that the government acquired a fiveacre plot at Bhamburda, on Senapati Bapat road, in 1951, from SC/ST communities and handed it over to the state animal husbandry department. The MSSGDC was allowed to operate from two sheds on the land after it was formed in 1978.

After persistent efforts by MSSGDC, the government issued a notification in 1995 allotting two acres of the land to it for setting up its headquarters, laboratory and training facility. However, the land was never formally transferred to MSSGDC.

6,PMT budget rules out fare hike,"PUNE: No fare hikes have been proposed in the Pune Municipal Transportâ€™s (PMT) Rs 150.37-crore budget for 2003-04, presented before the Pune Municipal Corporationâ€™s (PMC) transport committee on Tuesday.

The budget, which was presented by PMT general manager Charuchandra Pathak, has highlighted a deficit of Rs 16.58 crore. The revised budget for 2002-03, which was also presented on Tuesday, revealed that losses have escalated from the original estimate of Rs 18.85 crore to Rs 24.12 crore. Pathak attributed the rise in losses to a Rs 3.38-crore shortfall in revenue and a Rs 1.92-crore increase in expenditure.

The PMT losses would be covered up through grant from the PMC, Pathak said. In his budget speech, Pathak mentioned that the main reason for not achieving the revenue target in 2002-2003 was that the PMT was not able to earn revenue from the sale of tickets as per the expectations and the increase in diesel prices by Rs 4.34 per litre over the last few months.

However, due to the ban on six-seaters on Sinhagad road, Satara road and parts of Ahmednagar road, the PMTâ€™s daily earning has increased by Rs 2 lakh, and this was the first step in the direction of achieving a breakeven point, he said. He said that by the end of February, 100 new buses would be inducted into the PMT fleet, taking the number of buses to 850. â€œWe will ensure that at least 750 buses run on the roads every day and we expect to increase our revenue by from Rs 77.73 crore in the current financial year to Rs. 101.83 crore the next year.

Elaborating on the future plans, Pathak mentioned that after the induction of 100 new buses, 40 buses, which are more than 15 years old, would be scrapped. This would help in reducing maintenance expenditure and petrol, he said. If the PMC gives a grant of Rs 18 crore to buy new buses, then another 70 buses, which are more than 15 years old, would be scrapped, Pathak added. He said two new buses had already been inducted into the PMT fleet on Tuesday.

â€œAll the new buses have been designed according to the Bombay high court directives and have been made easily accessible to physically-challenged persons. In these buses, the height of the foot-board has been reduced and there is a bar inside the bus. Soon, bus stops will be modified to suit the needs of the physically-challenged,â€� Pathak added. He said the buses would adhere to Bharat-II emission norms.

Pathak said a detailed study of the functioning of the PMT was in progress. After the study is over, a prominent software company will be given a contract to provide the PMT with enterprise resource planning (ERP) software.

He said it was likely that the new wage agreement with the employees would get the nod from the state government, which will increase the expenditure on the wage bill by Rs 60 to Rs 80 lakh. â€œHowever, this expenditure will be recovered from fare hikes in the future and reduction in administrative expenditure.â€�

Pathak said the PMT would give priority in the next year to study the flow of traffic and deploy more buses on routes during rush hours. Importance would be given to start point-to-point service, on the lines of BEST. Semiluxury buses will soon be started on routes like Kothrud and Chinchwad or Kothrud and Bhosari for the convenience of engineers, executives and other staff.
