0,RLD ministers felicitated,"LUCKNOW: It was celebration time at the state headquarters of the RLD on Saturday as the newly sworn-in ministers of the party were welcomed and felicitated while party cadres vied with each other to garland Chaudhary Babu Lal, Tejpal Singh and Swami Omvesh.

The felicitation programme was followed by a meeting of zonal representatives which was presided over by the central zone president Jagdeo Singh Yadav who asked the cadres to make use of the stint in power to spread the roots of the party in far-flung areas. He castigated the Mulayam Singh Yadav and accused him of conniving with forces which were never followers of the ideology practised and preached by the Chaudhary Charan Singh.

1,Post-expansion blues: Rumblings in saffron party,"LUCKNOW: Fresh problems cropped up for the beleaguered Bharatiya Janata Party within 24 hours of the much-awaited cabinet expansion in the state.

The rumblings of discontent, which began much before the swearing-in ceremony, spilled out in the open on Saturday as disgruntled MLAs and MLCs from the saffron party held closed-door meetings and unanimously decided to chalk out a decisive plan of action of October 18 â€œto deal with the gross injustice done to the committed party loyalists.â€�

The mood among rebels, united by disappointment, was belligerent towards the state party leadership. Talking to Times News Network, Ramashish Rai, MLC from Deoria, blamed the â€œpowerful foursome Kalraj Mishra, Vinay Katiyar, Rajnath Singh and Lalji Tondon for ignoring the norms of seniority and performance for extraneous considerations. â€œWe donâ€™t even wish to any of them individually,â€� he said, adding â€œthis time nothing but the intervention by central leadership will do.â€�

So rendezvous and intrigue were the order of the day as the disgruntled MLAS and MLCs assembled in small groups even as some of them issued press statements. Joining in the defiance by the rebels were the old party stalwarts like Narendra Singh Gaur, Shiv Kant Ojha, Ganga Bhakt Singh, Harish Chandra Shrivastava, Jagdish Mishra alias Balti Baba, Indradev Singh, Narendra Verma, Lalloo Singh and Yagya Dutt Sharma, among others.

Sharma, MLC from Allahabad-Jhansi constituency, in a signed statement alleged that â€œBundelkhand was presented to the BSP on a platter rendering the BJP orphanedâ€�. Ramashish Rai also sided with this â€˜no holds barred approachâ€™. Commenting upon Tondonâ€™s threat of initiating disciplinary action against the rebels, Rai shot back menacingly: â€œLet him tryâ€�.

The muscle-flexing has predictably sent alarm bells ringing in the party leadership which is overtly taking a tough stance. Katiyar, according to informed sources, was extremely blunt when he chastised a group of dissidents on Friday and, following the lead, is Tondon who also seems to be in no mood to cower.

The reason is obvious as one senior party source reasoned: â€œWe have our governor and government at the centre and the state. Moreover, Mulayam Singh Yadav is in a much-weakened position today and the Congress offers no immediate reward for switching sides, so where will these people go?â€� Labelling the brewing rebellion as a temporary phase â€œwhich invariably follows ministry formationâ€�, he said: â€œIf the worst case, we may opt for carrot and stick policy. Ministerial berths to a few mahabalies in the group and cation against others.â€�

2,Notorious criminal arrested after police encounter,"PATNA: An alleged notorious criminal, Suman Singh, belonging to the Nata Singh gang of Mokama, was arrested following an encounter with the police in Mor village under the Mokama police station on Saturday. Sumanâ€™s brother Dinakar Singh alias P P, received bullet injuries in the encounter.

He has been admitted to a hospital at Mokama. Confirming the encounter, Mokama police station officer-in-charge K Chandra said the police have recovered one countrymade revolver and 12 cartridges, including two live cartridges. The other criminals managed to escape from the spot. The police opened 28 rounds of fire, Chandra informed. According to Chandra, it was early morning when the police, acting on a tip off, raided Suman Singhâ€™s native village Mor.

Sensing danger, the criminals hiding in Sumanâ€™s house opened fire on the police and the police returned the fire. One of the criminals fell after receiving bullet injuries and meanwhile, while Suman tried to escape the police chased and arrested him, Chandra said. Chandra feels that Sumanâ€™s arrest will help the police to solve many cases including the kidnapping and murder of two registrars at Vaishali district in the recent past. The Bolero jeep, which was used for kidnapping the two registrars, was found parked near the same Mor village, he informed.

The vehicle was looted from an area under the Khajanchi Hat police station of Purnea district before the kidnapping of two registrars, he stated. He further disclosed Suman was suspected to be involved in the vehicle loot case also. Sumanâ€™s name also figured in the murder case of one Mantu Sharma who was shot dead at Mokama in broad daylight on November 25, 2001. While the others, who were named accused in this case, were arrested earlier, Suman was absconding, Chandra informed. Earlier, Mantu had reportedly made an unsuccessful bid to eliminate Suman a few months before his murder. One shot: One Rajdeo Prasad was shot dead in a field at village Aurangpur under the Dhanarua police station on Saturday. The police are yet to ascertain the reason behind the incident. Meanwhile, another 55-year-old man, Surendra Prasad, was shot dead at Machharhatta village under the Barh police station on Friday night.

The body has been sent to the Barh hospital for post-mortem examination. One arrested: The police arrested one Pappu Kumar alias Mithilesh Kumar from an area under the Shastrinagar police station on Friday night. Autorickshaw recovered: The police recovered a autorickshaw on Saturday which was earlier looted from Bhagawatipur village under the Shapur police station of Patna district.

5,Free mobile incoming call proposal between networks on hold,"NEW DELHI: Cellular operators have decided to put on hold their proposal to offer free incoming calls between two networks to the cellular customers in the country.

""The proposal for offering customers free incoming calls between any two mobile networks, not necessarily in the same circle, has been put on hold,"" T V Ramachandran, director general of Cellular Operators Assosciation of India (COAI), said.

Ramachandran said that the proposal was put on hold due to various considerations including technical ones.

""There were various complications involved in the sense that while talking about mobile to mobile free incoming calls from any network to any network, how do we reasonably address factors such as whether fixed charges should be applicable, or it is more appropriate to have a termination charge,"" he said adding that certain technical issues relating to the numbering scheme were also involved.

""We could not come to a conclusion on these matters immediately,"" he said adding the cellular operators had also to address more pressing issues relating to Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL''s) stand on the TRAI''s cellular tariff order of September and concerns of cross subsidising and predatory pricing.

6,"After successful J&K polls, EC to focus on Gujarat","NEW DELHI: After a successful conduct of elections in Jammu and Kashmir, the Election Commission is all set to focus its attention on Gujarat where assembly polls are likely sometime in December.

""The Commission will now gear up for Gujarat polls after the Puja holidays"", EC sources said.

The Commission is awaiting Supreme Court''s opinion on a three-point Presidential Reference questioning poll panel''s order deferring the polls. The Apex Court also refused to pass any interim order on the petition challenging the position of Narendra Modi as caretaker Chief Minister.

Turning down vociferous appeals from the ruling BJP for an early poll to the assembly dissolved on July 19, the Commission had earlier announced that it would consider framing a suitable schedule for the general election to the state in November-December this year.

7,"New govt will help facilitate talks, hopes Shabir Shah","JAMMU: Separatist leader Shabir Shah says he is hopeful the new government in Jammu and Kashmir will help facilitate dialogue process between Kashmiri groups and the Centre for peaceful resolution of Kashmir issue.

Unlike the BJP and the National Conference, which created ""hurdles"" in the dialogue process, the new dispensation is expected to move forward in resolving the Kashmir issue as promised by the Congress and the People''s Democratic Party in their election manifestos, Shah told PTI here.

The Jammu and Kashmir Democratic Freedom Party supremo said the new government must also address the issue of alienation of people from the mainstream.

It should take steps for withdrawal of POTA, release of political and other detenues and disbanding of the Special Operation Group (SOG) he said, adding a conducive atmosphere should be created for return of displaced Kashmiri Hindus.

Shah said various political parties wanted to see the exit of SOG for ""excesses"" committed by it.

The Central government, Shah said, should continue the dialogue process with the Kashmiri groups, including separatists, and initiate moves for talks with Pakistan for peaceful resolution of the problem.

Talks between India and Pakistan were necessary to de-escalate the tension, he said.

On Kashmir Committee headed by Ram Jethmalani, Shah said, ""They are friends of Kashmiris and can become a bridge between New Delhi and Jammu and Kashmir.""

The Committee is visiting the Valley for three days from October 18 to continue dialogue with separatist groups, he said.

8,NDA has given political stability to India: Advani,"NEW DELHI: Asserting the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) has given political stability to the country, Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani on Sunday said Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee will very soon become the longest serving Prime Minister after Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi.

""It is a matter of pride that Vajpayee has been the Prime Minister since 1998 .... and very soon he will become the longest serving Prime Minister after Nehru and Indira Gandhi,"" Advani said at a function at the BJP headquarters here on the occasion of the three years of the NDA rule at the Centre.

Stating Vajpayee has been providing leadership to the country for four-and-a-half-year now, Advani said in eight years before Vajpayee assumed office, there had been five to six Prime Ministers.

""Even now we can say that Vajpayee is the longest non-Congress Prime Minister to be in power,"" he said.

The Deputy Prime Minister said the NDA Government has given political stability and an able and honest government to the country and added one of its major achievements was that it had included regional parties in the national government.

""We have strengthened both federalism and democracy,"" he said.

Advani said the proposal for linking of major rivers was being given a serious thought as its need was being felt all the more because of drought situation in different parts of the country.

Vajpayee saw a presentation on the project before he left on a three-nation tour and efforts are on how to carry it forward, he said.

10,"Ministers should discuss disinvestment ""at home"": Advani","NEW DELHI: Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani on Sunday ruled out reconsidering the three-month postponement of disinvestment in HPCL and BPCL but felt ministers should not discuss the issue publicly.

""Three months later we will think about it,"" Advani remarked when asked whether a decision would be taken on the disinvesment in BPCL and HPCL after the Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee returns home on Sunday night after a week-long European tour.

Advani''s remark assumes signifiance in the light of Defence Minister and NDA Convener George Fernandes wanting faster completion of the divestment process in the two companies.

Advani, however, did not see any wrong in Ministers discussing issues relating to disinvestment but said this should be ""at home"".

He disagreed with a questioner that postponement of a decision on BPCL and HPCL had affected the image of the Government saying a similar decision was deferred for a year in the past.

11,Fake agent takes farmers for a ride,"LUDHIANA: Swindling farmers in a year of near-drought is simply unforgivable, but the cheats care little for scruples. Ninety-four farmers of Jagraon and adjoining villages are still waiting for the money for wheat and paddy sold by them to their commission agent, M/s Sidhu Traders.

It took them a couple of years to find out that there were others like them who had been cheated by Maghar Singh and and his two sons, Harjeet Singh and Jaswinder Singh. All three had ran commission agent outlets at three different places Jodhi, Mullanpur, and Sarabha village respectively.

The trio vanished from the scene after several months of fake assurances with what the farmers calculate to be a total sum of Rs two crores, explained Amarjit Singh, exsarpanch of Bhoparai village, who himself was a victim of these cheats.

The trio managed to charm the farmers so successfully that some farmers had kept their personal savings with them, thinking it was safe. The near bankrupt Santokh Singh from Dakha, who had given money besides selling 1,300 quintals of wheat, is now waiting for the past year to get his two daughters married. Sher Singh of Mohee village had similarly kept Rs seven lakh with the Sidhu family.

In March this year, the farmers got an FIR registered in the Mullanpur police station, but it brought little results, grudges Kabal Singh, another victim, residing in Mullanpur. Kabal, like other farmers, alleged that the police was going slow in the case as the family enjoys backing of two senior Congress leaders of the region.

Finally, last week, Harjeet Singh himself surrendered in the court, due to which Maghar Singh also had to present himself at the Mullanpur police station.

While Harjeet is in judicial custody, Maghar Singh has not been officially arrested. SSP Mukhwinder Singh Chinna concedes the fact stating that the police was trying to do the best by ""intermediating"" the case for the public outside the court.

He said that the police was also trying to persuade the father to sell off his property and clear the debts, so that it would bring some respite to the farmers. But the farmers now feel let down with the police trying to negotiate a mere 30 per cent of the total amount as return money.

Daljit Singh, a retired tehsildar from Lalton village, gave a detailed list of the family assets: three shops, 32 acres of land, 90 lakh rupees cash in Mohali bank accounts. The family had more than what they owe to the farmers, he added for emphasis.

12,"Officials, private shellers collude to cheat farmers","CHANDIGARH: In spite of tall claims of smooth paddy procurement made by the state government, the nexus between procurement agency officials and private shellers is forcing farmers at about a dozen mandis in the state to sell his produce much below the MSP.

The officials, however, deny any such nexus and argued that the real reason was that the produce did not meet quality specifications.

Mandis in Jalandhar and Kapurthala districts are among the worst-hit where farmers were being paid at times as low as Rs 510 per quintal against Rs 560 per quintal MSP announced by the Centre.

Last week in Jalandhar and Noormehal mandis paddy was also sold at Rs 500 per quintal whereas in Kapurthala, Phagwara and Sultanpur Lodhi the procurement rate barely touched Rs 520 per quintal.

In Amritsar district also the procurement price hardly came anywhere close to the MSP. While in Rayya mandi it hovered around Rs 530 per quintal, in Tarn Taran the procurment price touched the low of Rs 528 per quintal and in Amritsar mandi it was Rs 542 per quintal.

Farmers were deprived of the MSP in Faridkot district as well where again the Kotkapura and Faridkot mandis saw the procurement price to be between Rs 510 to Rs 530 per quintal.

Similar trend also surfaced in parts of Nawanshahr and Ropar districts where the price was marginally less than the MSP at Rs 545 per quintal. All this when the state government promised farmers in the state that they would not only be given the MSP, but additional bonus of Rs 10 per quintal on the last yearâ€™s produce and Rs 20 per quintal from the Centre this year.

In all around 45 lakh tonnes of paddy has been procured in the state so far which is marginally less than 63 lakh tonnes procured in the corresponding period last year.

Officials, however, attribute the last yearâ€™s higher figure to the fact that procurement commenced on September 21 last year whereas this time it started from October 1.

At the end of the season the total procurement is expected to touch around 100 lakh tonnes. Significantly, the bulk of procurement in the state has been that of ""A"" grade which touched close to 44.5 lakh tonnes whereas about 30,000 tonnes of grade ""B"" paddy has been lifted by the official agencies.

JD(U) MLA and Samiti chief Mahadev Prasad told reporters that government''s lack of seriousness on the issue has forced the Samiti to organise the rally.

He said except for the news that Nagappa is alive, both the family members and his well-wishers have not received any message from the brigand. Unlike in Dr Rajkumar''s case, leave alone the regular messages to the family, the government has not said anything about sending an emissary.

He claimed that over 25,000 people from Chamarajnagar and Mysore districts will attend the rally.

14,Robber posing as domestic help arrested,"NEW DELHI: The south district police have arrested a man who posed as a domestic help and later robbed a woman in Hauz Khas on Thursday. The police have arrested Trilok Chand (28) and said they have recovered the articles he had robbed.

A case of robbery was registered in Hauz Khas on Thursday after Lalita (75) stated she had been robbed by a man whom she had engaged as a domestic help just three hours ago. ""She said the accused had asked for tea. While she was preparing it, he had forced her to part with the jewellery,"" DCP (south) P Kamaraj said.

The accused had bolted her in a room and fled with jewellery and a purse containing Rs 10,000. The police were told that the accused introduced himself as the son of Chotey Lal, a washerman.

The DCP said the police traced Chotey Lal (80) to the IIT campus near Hauz Khas. The victim had retired as an IIT librarian.

""It was found that the washerman has six sons from two marriages. While the involvement of four sons was ruled out after interrogating them on Thursday, the other two sons, Trilok Chand and Narender, could not be questioned as they were out on some personal work,"" the police said.

However, Lalita identified Trilok Chand as the robber. After sustained interrogation, he confessed to the crime.

15,MLAs find development funds hard to spend,"NEW DELHI: Amidst cheers and applause, the Delhi legislative assembly passed a motion last March to raise the MLA development fund from Rs 1.5 crore to Rs 2 crore a year.

A couple of euphoric legislators promised to spend every paisa they got on developing their constituency, and demanded that the fund be raised to Rs 5 crore a year.

But a year later, not one of the 70 legislators could utilise the entire Rs 2 crore allocated. Some MLAs spent as little as Rs 22 lakh. The spending remained dismal and so did the condition of the constituencies.

Broken roads, clogged and open drains, heaps of garbage, dry taps and regular power cuts â€” common to almost all assembly segments â€” hardly indicate disciplined spending. With votersâ€™ cries for a meaningful change in the quality of life going unheard, the funds meant to provide civic amenities were either misused or lapsed due to non-utilisation.

Some examples of last yearâ€™s spending:

â€¢ 36 MLAs spent less than 50 per cent of the funds.

â€¢ The lowest amount spent was Rs 22 lakh by Najafgarh MLA Kanwal Singh Yadav. The second lowest spending was by Darshana Ram Kumar, MLA from Ram Nagar, who spent Rs 42 lakh.

â€¢ Four MLAs spent less than Rs 50 lakh.

â€¢ Chief minister Sheila Dikshit spent Rs 119 lakh on her Gole Market constituency.

â€¢ Badarpur MLA Ram Singh Netaji and Mandawali legislator Meera Bhardwaj spent the highest: Rs 172 lakh and Rs 174 lakh respectively.

Prominent among the defaulters were the Speaker Chaudhury Prem Singh, voted in from Ambedkar Nagar and deputy speaker and Delhi Cantonment MLA Kiran Chaudhury, both of whom spent only 59 lakh. However, Kanwal Singh Yadav who spent only Rs 22 lakh, claimed the figures released by the government were wrong and that he spent almost his entire allocation. ""I built roads, laid sewers and spent everything that came to me,"" he said.

Kasturba Nagar MLA Sushil Chaudhury, who spent 75 lakh, said the urban development department was slow to release funds. ""We had called tenders, but there were no funds to make payments. Almost Rs 60 lakh pending from last year was released this year,"" he said.

However, MLAs whose spending has been fairly disciplined have a different story to tell. Said Sarojini Nagar MLA Ram Bhaj: ""Spending funds requires prior planning. Legislators who donâ€™t utilise their funds often pass the buck to civic agencies and public utilities. But how is that some MLAs utilise the entire fund, while the rest canâ€™t even spend 20 per cent?""

Defending his department, state urban development minister A K Walia said the Delhi government is fast to disburse funds.

""Funds are released on time. There may be delays in calling tenders and awarding contracts. The MCD is often slow to implement schemes,"" he said.

Funds under the MLA head are not directly spent by the legislators but routed through the state urban development department. On intimation by the MLAs, the department passes the funds to the civic bodies â€” MCD, NDMC, Jal Board and Vidyut Board â€” which undertake capital and public works.

These works include repairing roads, installing tubewells, providing street-lights, sewerage, community centres and maintaining parks, to name a few.

Most of the works are undertaken by the MCD and legislators blame corporation officials for delaying works, which leads to non-utilisation of funds.

Walia said: ""The procedure of getting approval and transferring the funds to the concerned agency is a long-drawn one. There are practical problems like unavailability of building material or lack of staff. The MCD takes a long time to award works to contractors. It usually takes up to six months to begin work.""

Walia said the maximum amount is spent in the last quarter â€” from November to March. Sources point out that the funds are often misused due to the nexus between the MLAs and the officials in the departments which undertake various works.

A legislator said: ""In many constituencies, the MLAs take a cut-back of up to three per cent of the total cost of the project. The officials commissioning the work also get their share from the contractor. Funds are spent and the work is done, but only on paper.""

Legislators from east Delhi get about Rs 80 lakh extra from the Trans-Yamuna Development Board. The 16 assembly constituencies situated across river are entitled to these additional benefits. Besides the Rs 50 lakh lumpsum from the board, these 16 MLAs get about Rs 20 lakh for reinforcing the roads, Rs 6 lakh for street-lights and Rs 5 lakh for park maintenance.

Said Arvinder Singh Lovely, MLA from Gandhinagar in east Delhi, ""MLAs have to be active in devising schemes. The government provides us with ample resources. I have already planned schemes for next year. As the funds start floating, I would implement them one by one,"" he said. Lovely spent Rs 134 lakh last year. He claimed he spent almost all of his allocation from the trans-Yamuna fund.

However, over-enthusiasm in spending also has its pitfalls. In a bid to exhaust funds, a large number of MLAs have started expensive and often unnecessary projects. Recently, Lt-governor Vijai Kapoor raised objections to the installation of high mast lights in residential colonies, where normal street-lights would have done. A high-mast light costs up to Rs 2 lakh.

A common reason cited by MLAs for non-utilisation of funds is that the government does not allow them to spend on unauthorised colonies.

However, Lovely contradicts this argument: ""The government has been allocating separate funds for development of unauthorised colonies. This year Rs 15 lakh per colony was allocated.""

16,Adivasis protest against eviction,"MUMBAI: Thousands of Adivasis from all over the state joined with slum dwellers from Sanjay Gandhi National Park at a rally outside the Azad Maidan last week to protest against the eviction of tribals from forest land.

Representatives of over 38 organisations, including the Kashtakari Sanghatna, the Narmada Bachao Andolan, the Zopadi Bachao Parishad, under the banner of the National Alliance of People''s Movements, as well as members of the Left Front parties addressed the rally.

The tribals were protesting the Centre''s recent orders to evict encroachers from forest land by September 30. Since the directive, the state forest department had issued thousands of eviction notices.

Activists claim that the department is focusing on small landholders like tribals because they are easy targets.

They also pointed out that the orders ignored the traditional rights of tribals over forests.

While the chief minister had stayed the order in the state over recently, tribals claimed that the eviction drive had not stopped. ""The forest officials continue to harass us,"" said Prakash Solanki, an Adivasi from Thane district.

""If we are thrown out of our land, where will we go? We have been living here for generations.""

Tribals from Marathwada, Khandesh, Thane and Raigad, as well as those displaced by the Sardar Sarovar Dam in Nandurbar dominated the rally.

""We are here to look at issues concerning land, not just forest land,"" said Brian Lobo from the Kashtakari Sanghatna. ""We want the government to file an affidavit in the supreme court stating their position against these eviction orders. There should be no evictions without an inquiry into the land ownership, and alternate livelihoods should be provided to those who are evicted.""

The rally is intended pressure the government to reconsider its policies on displacement and eviction, not just of tribals on forest land but also of those affected by the Narmada dam and even the issue of slum dwellers evicted from public land.

17,J&K polls hailed as victory for NDA,"NEW DELHI: Celebrating three years of NDA rule at the Centre on Sunday, Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani hailed the ""free and fair election in Jammu and Kashmir"" as its ""biggest victory"".

Terming it as ""historic"", Advani said the elections showcased the government''s commitment to national security, unity and integrity.

""The real winner in this election has been India and its democracy and the loser has been the ISI and the terrorist tanzeems (outfits) it has nurtured,"" Advani said.

On the future course of action in J&K, Advani said: ""A process of dialogue has been initiated with the state''s people which will be resumed after the new government takes over.""

Devolution of power to the state and other issues will be covered in the dialogue. On Pakistan, Advani said: ""We are willing to talk on all issues, including J&K, but Pakistan will have to abandon terrorism first.""

On the withdrawal of troops deployed along the border, he said though Pakistan''s promise of ending cross-border terrorism has not been met, the final decision in this regard would be taken by the National Security Advisory Board soon.

Dubbing terrorism as the biggest threat, Advani said his government has been able to ""defeat several covert actions by Pakistan throughout the country"". He claimed that 161 ISI modules have been busted so far.

Summing up the government''s achievements, he said the NDA government had provided a ""stable polity and a performing government"".

When the petrol pump scam was cited, he praised Prime Minister Vajpayee for cancelling all the allotments. ""In the last 50 years, no government has taken such a bold step,"" he said.

Admitting that Gujarat violence was ""unfortunate"", he promised that it would not be repeated and gave the example of how the state was calm after the Akshardham temple attack.

He said the NDA experiment had strengthened ""cooperative federalism"". ""Centre-state relations have been the smoothest and most harmonious in several decades. The government has scrupulously followed the policy of non-discrimination.""

Advani said the BJP''s growth has ensured that the Congress'' dominance is gone forever. ""Because of the BJP, there are two stable poles of Indian politics. The rest of the parties have to decide which pole they want to be with,"" he said.
