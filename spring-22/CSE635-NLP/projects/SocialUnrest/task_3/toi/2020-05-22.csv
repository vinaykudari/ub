0,SAD's youth wing sounds bugle for panchayat polls,"MOHALI: The youth wing of the Shiromani Akali Dal has sounded the bugle for preparations for the forthcoming Lok Sabha Elections in 2004 and the panchayat elections in Punjab in the coming months. Kiranbir Singh Kang, vice-president of SAD's youth wing has said that the party would be giving the youth of the state an opportunity to contest in the panchayat and Lok Sabha polls. The party also released the names of the office-bearers of the SAD's youth cells in the different assembly constituencies of Ropar district so that the workers could start campaigning under their unit leaders. Addressing the members of SAD's youth wing Kiranbir said that the SAD was now depending more on youth and in the last assembly elections as many as 15 seats had been given to young Akali leaders. He said that the party leadership had also decided that in the coming panchayat elections as much as 25 per cent of the seats would be given to the youth candidates. The main issues with which the party is going to fight the panchayat elections would be growing menace of liquor and drug addiction in the villages. He said that under the Congress rule, temporary liquor vends had been opened throughout the state which was causing alcoholism among the youth. The workers were also asked to tell the masses about the Congress government's failure. On the question of alliance with the BJP at the panchayat and the Lok Sabha level, Kang said that the decision in this regard could be taken only by Parkash Singh Badal and if such a decision was taken the party would follow it. On the current issue of possible unity between the SAD and All India Shiromani Akali Dal, Kang said that if this happens it would be a welcome move and the list of office-bearers would be changed accordingly.

3,Bengal Inc slams TUs for bandh,"KOLKATA: Trade union leaders should decide once and for all whether they want more jobs to come into the city or whether they prefer not working at all. This was the message that came clearly from the city's industrialists and business community on Thursday, a day after the CITU sponsored trade strike brought life in the city to a standstill and led to passengers, tourists and senior citizens being harassed, pushed around and abused. We have nothing against trade unions and we do understand that their presence in the industry is not only necessary but also extremnely important. But if trade unions behave in an irresponsible manner then at the end of the day it is labour which will be hurt most. If there are no jobs where will labour go, said Amiya Gooptu, chairman of the Bengal Initiative. Gooptu felt trade union leaders should make responsible decisions to ensure that the image of the city did not take a beating. We strongly feel that what the trade unions should do now is try and increase productivity as is the case everywhere in the world. In all developed cities, man days are most important and stress is being laid on trying to improve work culture. Yet in West Bengal the number of man days lost in a year is maximum among all metros. A third of the days are lost in strikes, weekends and holidays. It's high time things changed if industry is to come to Bengal, Gooptu said. People like Jayati Saxena and Gurminder Singh couldn't agree more. Saxena who had come to Kolkata on a week's holiday from Chennai had to rush back a day earlier since she was suppsoed to sit for her GRE test in Chennai on Friday and could not afford to take any risks. He was supposed to take the Coromandel Express on Wednesday but cancelled it at the last minutes and took Tuesday's evening flight. He was here for such a short while and just because of the stupid strike he had to leave early. I wish he gets a job somewhere else once he is back from the US so that he doesn't have to suffer this terrible work culture, said his mother Gurinder.

5,Road rage rides over road rules,"PUNE: The recent spate of accidents, which have claimed 30 lives over the past 20 days, clearly highlight the need for urgent measures to improve highway safety. The accidents took place on the Pune-Mumbai expressway, Pune-Solapur, Pune-Ahmednagar and Mumbai-Bangalore highways. Among the worst of these was the one that occurred on May 17 around 3.15 am, on the Mumbai-Bangalore highway near Wakad, in which eight people were killed and 18 others injured when a private bus rammed into a truck parked dangerously on the road to Pune. The police said the bus driver failed to spot the stationary truck. In a clear case of an accident resulting from rash driving and over-speeding, three persons were killed and eight injured on May 20 at 3 am when a truck skidded on the Pune-Mumbai expressway. According to the police, the mishap occurred as the truck was over-speeding and the driver lost control over his vehicle. Highway police superintendent D.R. Shejwal said the absence of radar guns had hampered efforts to check rash driving, especially at night. He said the highway police had been pressing a long list of demands for the modernisation of its operations. All our demands are before the government and we are hopeful that these will be approved soon. Maharashtra state road development corporation (MSRDC) officer on special duty Vikram Bokey admitted that there was a need to introduce electronic gadgets and radar guns to monitor, detect and punish those crossing speed limits on the expressway. The MSRDC's specially appointed Delta Force is awaiting delivery of a fresh consignment of instruments, after which traffic conditions were likely to improve. A number of motorists who spoke TNN said that in the wake of the recent accidents, they have become extremely wary of night driving and agreed that severe penalties needed to be enforced to punish rash driving. I have decided against using the expressway at night, Pramod Dixit, who was proceeding in his car from Pune, told TNN. Truck driver Ratan Singh agreed that there was a need for some basic policing on the highway. If someone is breaking lane discipline or over-speeding, then he should be penalised, he said. Traffic safety crusader Chandmal Parmar told TNN that a number of vehicles did not have reflectors on the rear, which was extremely dangerous. In most of the accidents the vehicles were parked by the road-side and were not spotted by other vehicles approaching at high speeds, he noted.

6,Cong leader asks govt to stop works on Chitravati,"HYDERABAD: Anantapur District Congress Committee vice-president V Janakiramaiah on Thursday asked the state government to immediately intervene and stop the construction of projects on the river Chitravati as it would deprive drinking and irrigation water to Puttaparthi. Janakiramaiah, who visited the construction site along with other locals, told The Times of India over phone from Puttaparthi that work was going on at a slow pace at the project site. He said any construction activity on the river Chitravati bed would deny drinking water to Puttaparthi town, visited by thousands of devotees every day. He said the new projects would also deprive the people of Anantapur district drinking and irrigation water. Satya Saibaba had donated over Rs 350 crore to provide drinking water to many parts of the district. He wanted chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu to take up the matter with the Centre and, if needed, file a case in the Supreme Court against the Karnataka government.

7,Equipment shortage may plague Gandhi hospital at new place,"HYDERABAD: The Gandhi General Hospital is to move to a new location in Musheerabad by the end of August or early September. Even as the new buildings are being built according to Medical Council of India norms, the new hospital is likely to continue to be plagued by equipment shortage at least for an year. After the plan to build the new hospital was cleared, the state government had asked the various heads of the departments of Gandhi Hospital to submit a proposal on the equipment requirement. Following this the heads of the departments prepared a schedule, where in the cost of equipment added up to Rs 32 crore in order to meet the diagnostic and treatment needs, sources at Gandhi Hospital said. However, the government after studying this proposal turned it down and asked the doctors to prepare another proposal for Rs 11 crore based on which equipment for the new hospital will be provided initially. The heads of the department once again prepared a revised equipment requirement schedule for Rs 11 crore taking into account the requirement of all departments. But, the government now has decided to provide equipment worth Rs 4 crore to the Gandhi Hospital once it shifts to Musheerabad, according to health department sources. The rest of the Rs 7 crore worth of equipment is to be provided in a phased manner over the next few years, an official of the health department said. The hospital will need equipment worth at least Rs 11 crore initially to ensure that equipment shortage does not plague the new hospital, like it does at the present one, according to hospital sources.

Judge Sunil Kumar Garg extended the stay till May 27 after government advocate Panne Singh sought adjournment of the case on the ground that the state government had appointed S R Bajwa as special public prosecutor to argue the case. Acharya's counsel Hastimal Saraswat pleaded that since the state was unable to argue the case on Friday, the stay granted by the court on the arrest of his client should be extended. Accepting the plea, Garg extended the stay, fixing the next hearing on May 27. Saraswat is challenging the rejection of anticipatory bail application of Acharya Dharmendra, a senior member of the central Marg Darshak Mandal of the VHP, by a lower court in Bhilwara last month. Police had registered a case under Sections 153-A and 295 against the Acharya for performing 'trishul deeksha' and delivering ""communally inflammatory"" speech in Badnor town of Bhilwara district on March 1 this year.
