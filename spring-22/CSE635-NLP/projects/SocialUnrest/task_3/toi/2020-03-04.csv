0,Two killed in Tripura post poll violence,"AGARTALA: Two persons, including a 90-year-old woman, were killed, several others injured and at least 10 houses torched in post poll violence in Tripura on Monday, even as chief minister Manik Sarkar appealed to the people to maintain peace.

An ailing Hemlata Deb 90) was burnt alive when unidentified miscreants torched a hut at Sonatala village in west Tripura district on Monday, the police said.

1,Over 115 suicides in two months,"New Delhi: Over 115 persons committed suicide in the past two months. Six of these were reported in the last four days.

According to the police, the maximum cases have been reported among the youth. The reasons vary from unemployment, depression and, in certain cases, chronic illness as well. Also, more men have committed suicide than women.

Last year, the Delhi Police reported 944 cases, of which 606 were men. The number appears to be rising. In January 2003, a total of 25 cases were reported, of which 19 were men. â€˜â€˜The rest were reported in just 28 days of last month,â€™â€™ a police officer said.

A maximum number of suicide cases, 31, were reported from the northwest district. This was followed by 20 cases in the northeast and 19 in the southwest districts.

Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP), southwest, Tejinder Luthra said: â€˜â€˜Of the total number of cases, 10 were men and 9 women. Two of these women were unmarried. The suicides have been reported from Vasant Vihar, Vasant Kunj, Mayapuri and Dabri. Of these, four died after consuming poisonous substances, while others committed suicide by burning or hanging themselves.â€™â€™

In the south district, most of the victims were youths, hinting at a decrease in tolerance level under pressure, said DCP (south), P. Kamaraj.

â€˜â€˜Eight of 11 cases are in the age group of 18 and 28. Most were reportedly depressed, mainly due to growing economic pressures and lack of job avenues. In three cases, unemployment was the cause,â€™â€™ said Kamaraj.

Kamaraj felt that these individuals had given up under pressure. Added DCP (west), Dependra Pathak: â€˜â€˜The cases are mostly due to lack of conflict resolution options for an individual. At times, even flimsy circumstances propel an individual to take a drastic step such as this and at the spur of the moment.â€™â€™

Pathak cited the case of a 25-year-old married man in Patel Nagar. The man committed suicide after an altercation with his sister over watching a tele-serial.

Kamaraj said financial burden and depression due to clinical reasons are other two big reasons. He cited the case of an architect, Dipankar Chakraborty, a resident of Aravalli Apartments in Kalkaji. â€˜â€˜The suicide note written by the deceased mentioned that his finances were in a mess,â€™â€™ the DCP said.

Northeast DCP, Vivek Gogia, said: â€˜â€˜Though the cases in our area are of mixed-age groups, the number of youths is slightly higher and the reason primarily is economic deprivation.â€™â€™ Of the 20 cases in northeast Delhi, 11 are men and 9 women, including five in the age group of 21 and 30.

Gogia said most cases reflected that there was pressure thrust upon an individual, mainly financial.

In central district, 11 suicides were registered while in north district, seven cases were reported. Two suicide cases were registered in New Delhi district.

3,"No U-turn on privatisation, says minister","HYDERABAD: Finance minister Y Ramakrishnudu on Tuesday appealed to the Centre to amend the Constitution to empower state governments to borrow funds directly without having to seek the Centreâ€™s approval. The minister also wanted the Centre to give 50 per cent of any loan as grant as against the 30 per cent now.

Replying to a marathon four-day debate on the state budget, the minister made it clear that there was no going back on privatisation and claimed that the state was doing well on all fiscal parameters. Ramakrishnuduâ€™s threehour reply was loaded with statistics, figures and quotes from newspaper clippings.

Referring to recent budgetary exercises by the government, the minister said nonplan expenditure has been pruned to a great extent and asked the opposition parties not to criticise the budget for political benefits. Reciting his own poem, the minister said, â€œOpposition parties are like clouds that never rain but thunder and exhibit lightning, which are no use to the people.â€�

Ramakrishnudu said the stateâ€™s revenues have registered a growth sparing people from fresh taxes. The gap between the revenue and expenditure was expected to be 3.66 per cent, the minister said adding, â€œDeficit is common, how to bridge the gap is the question.â€� On the devolution of funds from the Centre, the minister felt that the surcharge being collected by the Centre should be limited to a specific period â€” â€œif not, states should get a share of that.â€� He reiterated the stateâ€™s demand of rewarding reformoriented states and wanted the funds of centrally-sponsored schemes be directly transferred to the consolidated fund of the states.

The government also wanted the Centre to empower states to directly impose taxes on services which are in the state list. stating that abolition of central sales tax would result in a loss of Rs 750 crore to the state, the finance minister said the Centre should work out an alternative to offset the revenue loss. He also sought an increase in the Calamity Relief Fund for states. The minister said the financial health of the state was â€œwell but for the debtâ€� and added â€œout of 12 fiscal parameters we are doing well on eight.â€� Ramakrishnudu denied the criticism that the state would was hurtling towards debt trap. â€œWe are making prompt payments and there is no question of defaulting,â€� the minister said.

All these issues would be placed before the 12th Finance Commission. Later replying to questions, Ramakrishnudu turned down the oppositionâ€™s demand for a white paper on borrowings and their investment.

The minister also made it clear that the legislative council would not be revived and added that Assembly sessions would not be held in Visakhapatnam as suggested by some members.

4,Indefinite Wankaner bandh from Thursday,"RAJKOT: The people of Wankaner have decided to go on an indefinite bandh from Thursday, to protest against the unhygienic water being supplied to the them.

Wankaner legislator Jyotsnaben Somani, on Tuesday, told TNN: â€œThe people have demanded that they be supplied water from the Wankaner bore project. Residents of the city are up in arms as the water that is being supplied at the present moment is unhygienic, smelly and is yellowish in colour.

Senior officials of Wankaner, including the vice-president of the nagarpaliks, D S Zala, and chief officer R T Kotak, have met the Rajkot district collector and apprised her of the problems faced by the people.

They said that unless clean drinking water was not supplied to the city, people will be forced to launch an agitation.

Meanwhile, efforts were being made to augment the water supply from the Wankaner bore project so that Wankaner could be given 300 million litre of water per day.

However, care will have to be taken that the supply does not affect the water supply to Rajkot, which is also in the grip of a serious water crisis.

Sources in the water supply board told TNN that some of the bores which were not in operation could be restarted to ensure clean water supply to the people of Wankaner.

Jitu Somani, a senior BJP leader and husband of Joytsnaben Somani told TNN: â€œIt is due to the unrealistic attitude of the Rajkot Municipal Corporation that people of Wankaner were being denied water from the bore project. If the RMC commissioner wants, the water could be released for the people of Wankaner but she was not that for reasons best known to her.â€�

5,UP Speaker takes measures to prevent violence,"LUCKNOW: In a bid to prevent a repeat of past incidents of violence inside the Uttar Pradesh assembly, the Speaker is not taking any chances and has installed small microphones and replaced glass surface on tables with sunmica.

The precautionary steps have been apparently taken by Kesri Nath Tripathi in the wake of a surcharged political atmosphere after the Opposition served a notice of non-confidence motion against the Mayawati government.

The state assembly has witnessed violence on a few occasions in the past with October 21, 1997 being dubbed as the ""darkest day in the history of the state assembly"" when mikes were hurled like missiles and glass-layered tables being thrown around. Several legislators were hurt in this violence.

""We have ensured that no item is kept inside the assembly which has potential for causing injuries,"" Tripathi said on Wednesday ahead of the crucial sitting of the session.

Tripathi appealed to members to keep calm and conduct themselves in a dignified manner and rerain from using unparliamentary language. Members also should take care to avoid rushing to the well of the House and make their observations from their seat only , he said.

6,"DMK, Samajwadi Party clash in Lok Sabha","

NEW DELHI: Members belonging to the DMK and the Samajwadi Party almost came to blows in the Lok Sabha on Wednesday over the language issue during Question Hour forcing Speaker Manohar Joshi to adjourn the house for 15 minutes.

The uproar on the issue of language on milestones on highways in Tamil Nadu was sparked when C Krishnan of the MDMK wanted to know why Tamil was not being used on the milestones.

Supporting him, AIADMK leader P H Pandian said, ""We cannot compromise on the question of language. Tamil is an ancient language. Why it is not being used on the milestones?""

The Speaker ruled that Krishnan''s supplementary was not relevant to the main question but DMK and AIADMK kept on asking why Tamil was not being used on the milestones.

Prabunath Singh (Samata), Akhilesh Singh and Ramjilal Suman (both Samajwadi Party) and Raghuvans Prasad Singh (RJD) said Hindi is the national language. This provoked DMK members Adi Shanker, Krishnaswamy and Vijayan.

External Affairs Minister Yashwant Sinha, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj, Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Bhavnabehn Chikhalia and several Congress leaders tried to pacify the agitated members.

The din continued even as the Speaker said Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee wanted to intervene but the DMK members appeared to be in no mood to relent.

Minister for Road and Highways B C Khanduri said that the Government was pursuing the three-language formula. This also failed to calm agitated members forcing the Speaker to adjourn the house for 15 minutes.

7,EC to form rules on misuse of power,"NEW DELHI: The Election Commission intends to strengthen the present rules on checking incumbent governments from misusing their power during Assembly bye-elections.

Saying his colleagues and he hoped to come out with something in this regard soon, Chief Election Commissioner James Lyngdoh said the tendency of state governments to descend in strength on the electorate in bye-polls and make promises they have no business to was a continuous and ""nasty piece of goods.""

""We have some rudimentary ideas (on what to do) and are thinking (of more),"" he told journalists here on Wednesday during the inaugural of a three-day meeting of poll officials and experts from various countries. The meet was organised by International Democracy and Election Assistance, an inter-government forum on furthering representation structures in democracies.

Lyngdoh made his remarks (his fellow ECI members, TS Krishnamurthy and BB Tandon, were present) in the context of the strictures passed against Tamil Nadu chief minister Jayalalithaa for breaching the poll code of conduct during last week''s bye-election at Sattankulam. The ECI rapped her for doing so and then trying to deny what she had done but, eventually, her man went on to win the election.

""We''re supposed to be a civilised society and these are senior political figures..if they don''t feel embarrassed at such conduct, there''s little chance of democracy growing correctly,"" said the CEC on Wednesday.

On administrations trying to manipulate the list of voters, Lyngdoh said it happened regularly with all governments and was a continuing problem. The ECI is presently in the process of putting the entire roll on the Internet website and that ought to make it more difficult to illegally delete or add thousands of names, he said.

Earlier, IDEA secretary-general Karin Fogg said India''s continuing example in holding impartial elections on such a scale was a source of great inspiration. ""The statistics are awesome...600 million registered voters...smaller nations can barely imagine an exercise on such a scale.""

The IDEA was founded in 1985, has 21 member-countries and is based in Stockholm. The ongoing meet is the first occasion it is having its annual conference outside Europe and is, its people made clear, a recognition of the Indian election system''s place among the top in the world''s listing.

8,Flout the dry law and end up sweeper,"GANDHINAGAR: If enacted, this law would create a surfeit of sweepers in hospitals if not check the drinking habits of people in this dry state.

Law minister Ashok Bhatt can never be accused of being short of ideas, though critics may say he is low on execution. Whichever portfolio he has held, he has left a stamp of his innovative mind on it. Many who thought his creativity would get somewhat stifled in the law ministry were perhaps wrong.

Bhatt was speaking about repealing some archaic laws in the Vidhan Sabha on Tuesday and made everyone stand up and take notice. He told MLAs that the government was contemplating a proposal under which a person convicted for violating prohibition laws would not be sent to jail. Instead, the person would be asked to clean the premises of maybe the Civil Hospital for the period of his incarceration.

He said those charged with trivial matters like drinking would be asked to join community service projects.

As per the existing legal provisions, those booked for drinking are imprisoned for 20 or 30 days and the government has to keep them in jail and provide them food and other facilities.

Almost all jails in the state are congested because of undertrials. The police and jail authorities couldnâ€™t agree more with Bhatt. Consider these figures: In 2002, a total of 1,05,853 people were arrested in Gujarat for violating prohibition. In 2001, 96,080 people were nabbed. Sources said that in Ahmedabad division alone, on an average 100 people are arrested daily for drinking.

Between 1997 and 2002 a total of 3,28,104 arrests were made. Senior officials of the prohibition department said, â€œHowever, in only 0.5 per cent of cases are the arrested actually convicted. That too only when the accused pleads guilty. In an overwhelming number of cases, the offenders are acquitted.â€�

But, till they get acquitted the accused are undertrials in the stateâ€™s jails. The jail authorities, who have to contend with overcrowding, say a majority of the undertrials are those arrested under the Prohibition Act.

The Sabarmati Central Jail in Ahmedabad has a capacity of 1,300 but houses over 2,900 inmates. The Central Jail at Vadodara, with a capacity of around 900, has 2,000 inmates. The Surat district jail has exceeded its capacity by more than 1,000. Instead of the stipulated 600 the jail now has 1,600 people in its custody.

But Bhatt is not focusing only on prohibition laws. He said the Law Commission has allowed the state government to repeal 240 old laws as had become obsolete and irrelevant.

He assured the members that all the old laws enacted by the erstwhile Bombay Province, implemented in Maharashtra and Gujarat, would be redefined soon as Gujarat Acts in lieu of Bombay Acts.A special Bill is being prepared for this purpose.

The state government, he said, was also considering to make registration of marriage mandatory on the lines of registration of birth and death. Bhatt urged the legislators to send their suggestions on proposed amendments to new laws.

9,Use of Hindi in TN leads to protests in LS,"NEW DELHI: Use of Hindi on milestones along a highway in Tamil Nadu triggered angry protests and brought agitated DMK members and their counterparts from the Samajwadi Party (SP), the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and the Samata party perilously close to a showdown.

The Speaker was forced to adjourn the House. However, the House was able to return to business in 15 minutes.

The situation flared up suddenly during Question Hour when C Krishnan (MDMK) wanted to know why Hindi was being used in milestones on the highways of Tamil Nadu in place of Tamil.

DMK and AIADMK members who are normally at loggerheads, for once came together and fought it out with the other parties. P H Pandian (AIADMK) regretted that though Tamil was an ancient language it was being ignored.

The matter came to a flash when Akhilesh Singh, Ramjilal Suman (both from the SP), Prabhunath Singh (Samata) and Raghuvans Prasad Singh (RJD) protested, pointing out that the use of Hindi was justified since it was the national language.

Apparently provoked by the statement, several DMK members â€” Adi Shanker, Krishnaswamy and Vijayan among them â€” moved menacingly towards them. Timely intervention by foreign minister Yashwant Sinha and others prevented an unseemly incident.

Parliamentary affairs minister Sushma Swaraj and minister of state for parliamentary affairs Bhavnabehn Chikhalia also intervened and several other Congress members also tried to pacify the agitated members.

With the situation going out of control, the Speaker adjourned the House for 15 minutes. B C Khanduri, the concerned minister, sought to assuage the members by saying that the government was trying to follow the three-language policy.

10,"Bills on law, Nirma varsities passed","GANDHINAGAR: The state assembly on Wednesday unanimously passed three Billsâ€” the Gujarat National Law University Bill, Nirma University of Science and Technology Bill and the Fisheries Bill.

Replying to the debate on the proposed National Law University to be set up in Gandhinagar, law minister Ashok Bhatt said the institute would have international standard in offering undergraduate to doctoral courses in law and undertaking research on international laws to curb terrorism and cyber crimes.

Referring to the suggestion of leader of the Opposition Amarsinh Chaudhary that all law colleges in the state should be affiliated to the proposed university, the minister said it was not possible since it was a national law school.

Chaudhary complimented Bhatt for bringing the Bill to fulfil the long-cherished dream of a premier institute for excellence in legal education.

â€œIt is high time that Bhatt should come with a Bill repealing outdated laws with new amendments simplifying the legal process,â€� he said.

Education minister Anandiben Patel,who moved the proposal to set up Nirma University of Science and Technology in Nirma Institute along the Sarkhej-Gandhinagar highway, said it had produced 4,000 engineers and technocrats. In view of its excellent track record as one of the premiere institutes of technology not in India but world over, the state government has decided to offer a deemed universityâ€™s status to Nirma through this Bill.

Chaudhary said the government should prevail over the management of Nirma to accommodate bright students of poor families in the institute so that they are not deprived of the facility of higher education.

Replying to a brief debate on provisions of the Gujarat Fisheries Bill, fisheries minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasma allayed the fear expressed by Arjun Modhvadia of the Congress that it was nothing but duplication of the existing central acts for regulation of fisheries activities.
