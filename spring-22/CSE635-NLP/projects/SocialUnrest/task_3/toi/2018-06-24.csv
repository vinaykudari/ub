0,"SP hopes to form govt in UP, wary of Mayawati","new delhi: buoyed by the win at shahjahanpur last month, the samajwadi party has set its eyes on forming government in uttar pradesh, but feels a post-election alliance between the bjp and bsp could play spoilsport. the party wants early elections in the state, counting on an anti-incumbency wave against the bjp and with the congress all but decimated there. it is kanshi ram's bahujan samaj party that the samajwadi party claims it is most wary of. both parties are wooing the minorities and the dalits. ""mayawati has already become chief minister twice through an opportunistic alliance with the bjp. what stops her a third time?"" asks samajwadi party spokesman amar singh. mayawati, he says is being ""used by the bjp to divide minority votes to spoil our chances."" he admits she could be a ""formidable partner of the bjp"" in the post election scenario. though the bjp and bsp had parted ways the last time around with much acrimony, another alliance may not be an impossibilty. the bjp has already said it is looking at both pre-poll alliances with people like ajit singh as well as post-election tie-ups. the samajwadi party has a strong base in up with all its 27 members of parliament from the state. it is also the single-largest party in the state assembly. the shahjahanpur win, the party feels, bodes well, since its candidate ram murthy singh verma won the shahjahanpur seat against strong candidates. the seat fell vacant due to the death of veteran congressman jitendra prasada. the congress fielded prasada's widow kanta prasada, while the bjp had fielded stalwart satyapal yadav. mulayam singh yadav's party is also upbeat after the revival of ties with the left parties and hopes to cash in on the presence of v p singh in the recently set up lok morcha. ""last time we got 140 seats going alone. this time we have the support of the left. without any effort we should get about 180 seats and with a little effort, over 200"", claims amar singh. he also points to the fact that with the carving out of uttaranchal, a little over 200 seats will allow formation of government. the samjawadi party's base is largely in the belts that remain in up. party leaders are already camping in the state gearing up for the elections, which could be held anytime before march next year. other parties are also focussing on up. bsp leader mayawati rushed recently to the site of caste clashes in the state with an eye on the elections.
