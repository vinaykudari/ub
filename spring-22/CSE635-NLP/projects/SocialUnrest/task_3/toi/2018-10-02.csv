0,"Helpless farmers, crafty middlemen","pathankot: amidst complaints from farmers over thedifficulties being faced over the sale of their paddy in mandis, the administration has told officials of the procurement agencies to expedite the lifting of their stocks as ""open market scheme was a failure"", while farmers were being forced to sell their stocks at a lower price. it is being alleged that procurement agencies are hand in glove with the arhtiyas who pay them less due to the official delay in picking up their stocks. it is learnt that though at the first meeting of the regional consultative committee of the food corporation of india (fci), its chairman, vinod khanna, had asked fci officials and officials of all the state agencies for adopting appropriate strategies for tackling problems of procurement, transportation, storage, quality and supplies, the officials were refusing to lift the stocks even when the moisture content was well within the prescribed limit of 18 per cent. as a result, they are being forced to sell their stocks to arhtiyas who are paying them less. while several farmers in gurdaspur mandis have alleged that the paddy stock had not been procured even after a week as ""quality inspectors did not perform their duties"" due to which the daily bidding of stocks did not take place in the presence of farmers. despite the fact that the state government had issued a warning of stern action against the ""erring employees"", farmers continue to suffer at the hands of the procurement agencies, said sardul singh whose paddy stock has been lying in the mandi for over a week. however, gurdaspur deputy commissioner kulbir singh sidhu said that the administration was making all-out efforts to ensure smooth procurement. he said the problems faced were due to the non-cooperation of arhtiyas who refused to purchase paddy cut with combine harvestors. while the government has initiated action against the ""erring arhtiyas"" and also cancelled licences of many of them, the arhtiya association's is bent on not procuring paddy cut by combine harvestors. a majority of the farmers, here, harvest their produce using machines. sidhu said that the administration had given an assurance that the entire produce would be procured at all costs. however, balkrishan mittal president of the arhtiyas' and rice millers' association refuted the administration's charge that arhtiyas did not cooperate in purchasing the paddy. ""we are purchasing paddy as per the norms set by the government. most of the paddy arriving in gurdaspur is not upto the mark,"" said mittal. he said that rice millers also felt that the paddy lacked quality. ""they have to ensure quality as the government demands quality rice from them,'' he said. sidhu said that the procurement this year was higher than that of last year. according to the procurement figures available, while the food supply department procured 5,449 metric tonnes (mt) of paddy till sunday, markfed procured 17,912 mt, punjab agro 8,863 mt, warehousing corporation 14,268 mt, while the fci and private parties procured 71,193 mt and 65,202 mt of paddy, respectively. he said committees comprising administration officer, farmers and arhtiyas had been set up at all purchase centres.

1,"PMC, NGO row may scuttle slum development project","pune: the pune municipal corporation's (pmc) ambitious project of creating a computerised database of slums in the city has run into rough weather, following a dispute between the pmc and m/s shelters associates, a city-based non-governmental organisation (ngo), which works for the betterment of slums. the pmc has served a legal notice to the ngo, charging it with failing to document database of 1.5 lakh huts. it has also threatened to file a police complaint and a civil suit against the organisation if it failed to return within seven days the rs 26 lakh which the pmc paid it as advance. shelter, however has hit back, claiming that it prepared database of one lakh huts, out of the total 1.5 lakh to be surveyed, and submitted it to the pmc in october last year, but the pmc did not procure vital software required to examine this data. the fact is that the software called geomedia, is lying with the pmc's octroi department for the last six months, while shelters associates and the pmc's slum improvement department are debating who should pay for it! the delay in procuring the software and the offensive stand taken by the civic administration could well ruin the project, which could have gone a long way in executing the lokawas housing scheme and several other slum improvement schemes. former municipal commissioner, ratnakar gaikwad, had strongly recommended the project, pointing out that 40 per cent of the city's population resides in slums. accordingly, on may 25, 2000, the pmc gave a rs 55.55-lakh work order to shelters associates for creating a database of 1.5 lakh huts within a year, at the rate of rs 37 per hut. as per an agreement, ironically signed six months after the issuance of the work order, on november 18, 2000, shelters associates was to undertake a manual survey of slums in the city to ascertain the slum area, ward numbers, ration card numbers of slum dwellers, reservation of land as per the development plan and plain table maps. but the pmc says the plain table maps prepared by ngo do not reflect the reservations charted out in the development plan and also do not demarcate boundaries of ""declared"" slums, charges that the ngo strongly refutes. speaking to reporters here on monday, office-bearers of shelters associates, pratima joshi, an architect, and srinanda sen said the reservations cannot be shown on plain table maps, but could be seen by superimposing the development plan map on plain table maps. similar method can be applied to see the boundaries of slums, she said. ms joshi and ms sen presented a computer demonstration, showing that data pertaining to every hut, including details like location, names of its dwellers and their income was available with it. ""you name the details and we have them ready,"" ms joshi said, pooh-poohing the pmc's claims. launching a counter attack, she said the pmc was not in a position to view the data in the absence of the crucial software, which costs rs 95,000. ""in fact, the verification committee, appointed by the municipal commissioner to probe our claims, had to view the database at our office, as the pmc does not have the software,"" she said. ""the pmc has paid us rs 27 lakh only, as against the rs 37 lakh fixed for the database of one lakh huts,"" ms joshi added. office-bearers of shelters associates are also agitated over the verification committee's findings, which they claim are very trifling and do not warrant cancellation of the project.

2,Haryana to enact law against illegal colonies,"chandigarh: haryana will soon enact a new law to punish those re-sponsible for setting up unauthorised colonies in the state. stating this, chief minister om prakash chautala said that the mush-rooming of unauthorised colonies around well-planned urban areas was creating several problems, besides forcing the authorities to provide them the basic amenities. the chief minister, who was talking to mediapersons at narwana, on monday, disclosed that he would shortly start touring the remaining 14 assembly segments under the sarkar aap ke dwar programme that aimed at redressing grievances of the people at their doorsteps. he said that funds had been provided to gram vikas samitis which were sup-posed to undertake the developmental activities in rural areas. the chief minister also stated that he had postponed his foreign tour due to the prevailing tension over the us-taliban conflict which had ad-versely hit trade and industry throughout the world. he complimented prime minister vajpayee for his farsightedness, saying that he had stressed the need for collective efforts at the international level to fight terrorism in his address at new york a year back. when asked about the steps being taken by the state government to check the use of polythene carrybags, he said that the decision to ban them had been taken at the national level. polythene was, no doubt, a big health hazard, said chautala, adding that the central government was planning to ban its production.

3,"Swiftest procurement in a decade, says govt","chandigarh:despite appre-hensions in various quarters, paddy procurement this far has been very smooth, thanks to the meticulously planned procurement arrange-ment and sunny weather during the last 10 days. reports reaching here state mandi arrivals till september 30 this year have been almost double those for the corresponding period last year. the total mandi arrivals have been 26.43 lakh metric tonnes (mts) compared to 13.49 lakh mts during september last year. the most commendable aspect of the performance of procure-ment agencies is that, compared to last year, these have procured thrice as much paddy. as a result, private traders' share has fallen to 19 percent against more than 45 per cent of mandi arrivals last sep-tember. while they purchased most of the arrivals below the minimum support price (msp) as the paddy last year had been badly damaged, sunny weather this year has en-sured that grain contains moisture within the permissible limits. of the 26.43 lakh mts, traders have purchased 5.03 lakh mts while the state government's pro-curement agencies have lifted 15.79 lakh mts, which is 74.6 per-cent of the total procurement: sub-stantially higher than their allotted share. however, food corporation of india (fci) has lagged far be-hind. the state government had in-sisted over the years that fci pro-cure at least 40 per cent of the man-di arrivals but its share so far has been just 25.4 per cent of the total paddy procured. food and supplies secretary p ram told times news network that procurement this year has been the smoothest and swiftest in a decade and there have been no complaints of distress sales. traders have procured most of the paddy above the msp or, at most, rs 20 below it in open auctions. ram said paddy not conforming to specifica-tions had been sold in open auc-tions, to the satisfaction of farmers. despite apprehensions that the government would find it difficult to store paddy, leading to a glut in mandis, ram said the government had made local arrangements for complete storage of mandi arrivals.

6,Writers’ staff arrested for fraud,"kolkata: the kolkata police detective department on monday arrested a government employee from writers' buildings. the employee has allegedly received a kickback of rs 50,000 from a studio for placing a government order of photographic materials using forged documents. detective department chief somen mitra said, gautam chaterjee, 46, a store-keeper of the information and culture department, forged a government order by faking the signature of the director of information and culture department and placed it with studio hollywood at 31, lenin sarani, in november 1997. he also received a kickback of rs 50,000 for helping the studio bag the order. besides the kickback, he also procured materials worth over rs 15,000 as the first instalment. since then, gautam, a resident of metiabruz, disappeared. later, when the studio men tried to recover the money, the departmental officers told them they had not placed any such order. however, gautam assured them that the order was not fake and he would help the studio realise the money. after three years had passed, debjani bose, the proprietor of the studio, lodged complaints with the taltala police station and the cheating section.

8,Buddha’s bandh ban hits roadblock,"kolkata: political parties participating in an all-party meeting to put a stop to rail and road blockades in the state were divided down the middle with the cpm, the rsp and the bjp supporting the idea, the trinamul congress abstaining and others opting to retain the right to stage demonstrations as a democratic right. chief minister buddhadeb bhattacharjee, who convened the meeting, claimed, however, that a broad consensus had been reached. we are not in any way interfering with the democratic or trade union rights of the people. the government will not stand in the way of mass movements held in the larger public interest, bhattacharjee told newspersons after the meeting. the government will prepare a draft on the basis of the points on which views have converged in a week. this is not something which can be achieved overnight, he said. movements should not make the common man suffer, the chief minister said. if a factory is closed, if the workers block the road or trains, how would that affect the owner?. he denied any attempt to frame new laws to stop such demonstrations. laws are already in place but we don't implement them. there is need for a political consensus on the issue, he said. the most vociferous opposition came from the suci. ever since buddhadeb bhattacharjee became the chief minister, he has been trying to curtail the rights of the working class, senior suci leader manik mukherjee said. the cpi, one of the major left front partners, also took a hard line stance. the right to protest against injustice a part of democratic rights. if any one tries to take it away, we will never accept this and launch a movement to counter such attempts, cpi state assistant secretary himangshu das said. the cpm and rsp shared an identical viewpoint. we have seen that protests by a handful of people do not achieve any real goal, cpm's shyamal chakraborty said.

9,Muzaffarpur violence: Culmination of people's hatred,"muzaffarpur: the unprecedented mob violence and police firing of september 26 was the culmination of public hatred against police inaction and mishandling of kidnapping and extortion cases in last three years. the recovery of the mutilated body of an innocent kidnapped child golu caused the public revolt. the mob fury could have been contained, had the police cared to see the writings on the wall after burning of a government jeep and a fire brigade tender the previous night. as soon as the people learnt about the recovery of child's mutilated body, they put up road blockades at almost all the chowks. the police did nothing to prevent blockades. they started assaulting the pedestrians and onlookers including some journalists with lathis because those who actually blocked the roads had by then fled to narrow lanes. later, brickbatting started. the police acted in vengeance when they dumped the persons, mostly youngsters, injured in the firing without caring for their treatment. amit was kept on a push-cart at the sadar police station for six hours before being sent for treatment. mrityunjay asked for water before dying at chhata chowk but the police did not care to fulfil his last wish. the burning of the train at maripur railway crossing and disruption of rail and road services at siho were the fallout of police vengeance. muzaffarpur had to pay a heavy price, first for police inaction and then for disturbances. besides facing bullets and lathis, burning of a dozen vehicles and a couple of town outposts, public life remained paralysed and transport system crippled for four days. new sp ravindra kumar singh, who has had enough chance to feel the pulse of muzaffarpur during his last two postings -- first as a dsp and then as an sp, can succeed in justifying the aura of a ""tactful"" and at the same time, ""one of the most hardened police officers of bihar"" encircled around him only through abundant use of intelligence network and public cooperation. criminals have devised new techniques and their intelligence is matchless. they watch their ""targets"" for weeks before laying their hands on them. as the new sp himself knows, they even sell their ""targets"" to bigger parties. once successfully picked up, they start bargaining for ransom. they release them only after receiving money in almost all the cases and if they fail to contact the family members due to police pressure or for any other reason like ransom amount, they prefer to kill the captives. at least half a dozen captives have been done to death in the district in last four years. this figure belies police claim of recovery without ransom payment in most of the cases. if things do not improve soon, muzaffarpur will go mokama way, most people think. the only activity that is flourishing here is trade and commerce. people engaged in wholesale cloth business and contract work are fleeing. bank officials are panicky. even petty shopkeepers selling shoes are not spared by extortionists. traders, small or big, are threatened or killed by extortionists every now and then and as usual they pay rangdari. only police intelligence can collect correct information as nobody wants to risk life by divulging the threat despite police assurance. the new sp has advised citizens to identify ""black sheep"" living among them. but the malaise is so deep that one cannot afford to identify the gangsters and inform police either after the abduction or release.

10,Kalam incident raises questions about VIP safety,"ranchi: even as the director general of civil aviation (dgca) will be holding an inquiry into the circumstances leading to the crashlanding of the state government's pawan hans helicopter carrying the scientific adviser to the prime minister, apj abdul kalam, from ranchi to bokaro, the use of a single-engine chopper for a vvip flight has raised several questions regarding safety. kalam had a narrow escape sunday when the pawan hans chopper, vt-phl, had to crashland at the airstrip as it went out of control after its rpm (rotator per minute) dropped at a height of 20-40 feet above the ground level, damaging the aircraft considerably. had the problem occurred at a greater height it would have been fatal, aviation experts said. civil aviation officials here told the times of india that as per the norms laid down by the dgca and also in vip circulars the use of a single-engine aircraft should be avoided for vip flights as twin-engine aircraft were not only high powered but also ensured safeguards against such freak accidents. though this was not a mandatory norm, it was certainly advisable to use twin-engine choppers for vips, the officials said. though the jharkhand government received a five-seater aircraft from bihar as its share after the bifurcation of the state, the officials said that it was not of much use since most of the time it was in need for repair for which it had to be sent to bihar. on sunday, the five-seater plane was engaged elsewhere and could not be made available for kalam. according to the cabinet secretary, narendra bhagat, who was also the civil aviation secretary when the state government acquired the pawan hans chopper on lease last december, the company had a shortage of twin-engine aircraft during the period. the company which had leased out the single-engine chopper to the government for six months (the lease was renewed later) despite the latter insisting on a twin-engine aircraft had, according to bhagat, said that most of the state governments in the country were using single-engine choppers in the absence of sufficient twin-engine aircraft. the chopper acquired by the jharkhand government was deployed in the north-east before it was handed over to this state. while the officials aver that accidents are a matter of chance, fellow journalists who have travelled with the chief minister a couple of times insist that the chopper is not fit for vip use. once, recalled a scribe, the computerised route map to dumka failed and finally the passengers, including the cm, had to guess their way to their destination. on occasions more than one the chief minister's tour has been delayed due to some technical snags in the aircraft. while safety norms of chartered flights are being deliberated upon by the dgca the fact remains that the state governments helicopter apart from carrying the chief minister and other state ministers has also been ferrying union ministers. recently, it carried finance minister yashwant sinha and power minister suresh prabhu when they visited tandwa to inaugurate an ntpc project.

11,New slum policy soon,"new delhi: the country will soon have a comprehensive national slum development policy in order to improve the condition of the urban poor and those living in slums. the draft policy is ready and will be announced shortly, according to union urban development and poverty alleviation minister ananth kumar. the minister, speaking at a seminar on 'cities without slums' on the occasion of world habitat day on monday, said the national slum policy will have a more comprehensive and holistic definition of slums. ''different definitions and interpretations of slum prevail in different parts of our large and diverse country,'' kumar said. the proposed policy, he said, ''will attempt to cover all urban inhabitants who don't have access to the basic needs of life, be it shelter, infrastructure or a safe habitat.'' kumar said the attack on urban poverty will have to be three-pronged, targeting at environmental improvement, income upgradation and shelter for all. the minister said he will also moot the idea of having at least one city without slums.

12,'Amend CrPc to include care of aged parents',"mumbai: police commissioner m.n. singh on monday urged the government to make amendments to the code of criminal procedure (crpc) saying that it was high time grown-up children were made legally bound to look after their aging parents. speaking at a function organised by the maharashtra state women's council on the occasion of world elders' day, mr singh also called upon the government to come to the rescue of senior citizens who have become soft targets of criminals. ``at present, section 125 of the crpc provides merely for maintenance which means food, shelter and clothing. but in a city like mumbai, economic compulsions compel grown-up children to leave their parents making them the soft targets of criminals,'' he said. ``in many western countries, the public exchequer spends money for the welfare of senior citizens. in india, we have some old-age homes and in some cases, they too are found to be run by some fraud elements,'' he said. ``here, even the national policy for protection of senior citizens formulated by the centre in 1999 has not percolated to the state level.'' urging the senior citizens to come forward and register themselves with the local police station, he lamented only 10,000 out of an estimated 10 lakh senior citizens had done so. ``every year, around 20 senior citizens are murdered and in most cases the motive is robbery and the killer is the domestic help or a relative. we have detected 13 of the 17 such murders last year which is a detection rate of 76 per cent. if people come forward to co-operate, we can be detect the rest. despite violence against senior citizens many housing societies had still not installed any kind of security gadgets, he said. mukesh sharma, director, mumbai doordarshan, also made an impassioned speech asking the youth to go back to the age-old values of shravan kumar, the epic character, who carried his blind parents on a pilgrimage. ``the intrinsic value of an aged human being itself has decreased in these days of nuclear families,'' mr sharma lamented. the youth today must realise that they should not leave their parents in old-age homes, added mr sharma. he urged mr singh and the ngos to organise a phone-in talk show on doordarshan for highlighting this appeal.

13,Sena criticises govt. delay in purchasing,"mumbai: over three months after the ruling democratic front (df) government okayed the proposal in june for the purchase of chana dal and palm oil for sale in the public distribution shops (pds), the food and civil supplies department has failed to get its act together, the opposition shiv sena has alleged. criticising the delay in implementing policy decisions, sena mlc kanhayalal gidwani has voiced fears that pds card-holders in maharashtra will have to go without these two basic commodities during the divali season. ``the cabinet in its meeting on june 8 had agreed to make available 1 kg each of palm oil and chana dal to pds card-holders during the festive season. till date, however, the department has not placed orders for these two commodities. instead it is being said that the government has decided against purchasing the two essentials,'' mr gidwani told newspersons at mantralaya recently. he said the department had purchased 10,000 tonnes of chana dal in 2000 for divali and dassera, but the distribution of the commodities was done only after the festive season. ``taking into view the previous experience in chana dal purchase the government should instead ensure that card-holders are given 2 kgs of palm oil which is required by all households,'' mr gidwani said. the sena mlc said tenders should be invited from private players dealing in palm oil so that the government gets a fair rate. he said unlike in the past where the government purchased its palm oil stock from the union government's undertaking mineral and metal trading corporation, there should be an open bidding for the contract to supply palm oil. ``the requirement of palm oil is anywhere close to 20,000 tonne. if the contract is awarded to the corporation it will be expensive as they charge a three per cent service charge on every purchase. as against this if the government invites bids the rates will be competitive and the authorities can decide on the rate which is the best,'' mr gidwani said. explaining as to why the state government should desist from purchasing chana dal, mr gidwani said the subsidy on chana dal will be around rs 20 to rs 25 per kilo as against this the government will have to shell out a mere rs 15 as subsidy for the palm oil.

14,Crucial Sena meet on civic polls to be held,"mumbai: a meeting of prominent shiv sena functionaries will be held in thane on sunday to assess the party's prospects in the municipal council elections scheduled for december this year. party chief bal thackeray will address the closed-door meeting, which will be attended by senior party activists from rural pocketboroughs earmarked to go to the polls. the daylong conclave will debate on measures to be taken to revamp the sena's organisational structure in view of the elections to over 150 municipal councils as well as zilla parishads and panchayat samitis. elections to the mumbai and thane municipal corporations, among other civic bodies, are scheduled for february 2002. for the sena, the soon-to-come polls are crucial for at least two reasons. first, the battle of the ballot will indicate the popular mood vis-a-vis the congress-led democratic front (df) government as well as the saffron sena-bjp opposition combine. second, the sena will utilise the opportunity to assess its progress in terms of organisational expansion and the status of its social/caste base. the two-year-old df government is largely seen as a juggernaut whose pace has been hampered by a series of contentious issues, including the long-drawn row between the df partners over enron. the sena-bjp alliance may well plan to whip up an anti-df mood in the forthcoming civic elections, but the saffron siblings will first have to get their act together. the row in the bjp-led national democratic alliance, triggered by sena mp sanjay nirupam's outburst against the prime minister's office over the uti scam, is too recent to be forgotten. there are other irritants too for the sena. for instance, the violence and mayhem in thane following the sudden death of sena leader anand dighe in august promises to be a major source of embarrassment for the party. soothing the ruffled feathers of middle-class voters, both urban as well as rural, on the terror in thane is an uphill task for the sena strategists. meanwhile, the state bjp's recent decision to continue its poll alliance with the sena, chiefly to avoid division of hindutva votes has brought some cheer in the sena camp. however, mr thackeray's immediate worry is how to revamp the sena's organisational apparatus and in which way to re-kindle the `nikhaara' (fire) among his followers. a sense of despondency seems to have gripped the sena following the party leadership's failure to redeem its oft-repeated and much-publicised pledge to oust the df government and re-instal the sena-bjp regime in maharashtra. by announcing deadline after deadline for toppling the vilasrao deshmukh ministry, mr thackeray, as it were, raised his followers' expectations to a feverish pitch over the last two years. however, with several attempts of the sena to annex mantralay, the state government headquarters, coming to nought, the party workers slipped into inertia. the sena leadership is hopeful that at the thane conclave, mr thackeray will effectively employ his gift of the gab to mobilise partymen on the eve of the civic elections. the centre's nationwide ban on students' islamic movement in india (simi) has also strengthened the sena's case on terrorism, an issue on which mr thackeray has been both consistent and articulate.

""party workers and leaders are supposed to air their grievances within the organisation at various fora made available from time to time. the practice of going straight to the media without any discussion at the party forum is not acceptable for disciplinary reasons,"" says the resolution passed by the meeting on sunday. the resolution which was proposed by former corporator vasantrao mane was supported by several other leaders from the congress party. a large number of speakers castigated ms chavan for waging a war against the party with the help of the media. ""nobody should consider themselves bigger than the party or try to seek mileage at the cost of the organisation,"" says the resolution. corporators who sympathise with ms chavan's stand said they would continue to fight against the allegedly illegal dezoning. one of them, ramesh khanna, said sunday's meeting was unimportant as it was mainly attended and patronised by people who had no knowledge of either the congress party or its ideals. ""the people who passed the resolution against ms chavan have deserted the party in the past and their loyalty is questionable. such opportunists don't have the moral right to pass a resolution against genuine representatives like ms chavan,"" he said. mr khanna said their group had already written letters to chief minister vilasrao deshmukh and senior leader motilal vora who is in charge of the party's affairs in maharashtra. another corporator, ajit apte, said that ms chavan's demand to hold a detailed discussion on the dezoning issue was justified. ""we will stand by her despite the resolution passed by the party,"" he said. interestingly, sources said a group of 60-70 women from the dandekar pul slums barged into the meeting of the congress party on sunday to confront the mayor on the issue of ms chavan's resignation. the women condemned the mayor for denying ms chavan the chance to speak out at the general body meeting which forced her to resign from the pmc.

24,"Bachelor of politics, master of political science!","ahmedabad: narendra modi's career has witnessed a meteoric rise in three decades, starting from a small-time rss pracharak to being a strong contender for the chief ministership. the 48-year-old bjp's national general secretary began his political career as kankaria ward secretary of the jan sangh in 1965 in ahmedabad. as a young man from vadnagar, in north gujarat, who is still a bachelor, he was to soon mpress the rss leaders with his single-minded devotion to his job and a flair which was noticeable from an early age. after obtaining a master's degree in political science from delhi university, modi decided to join active politics. but to earn his livelihood, he managed the staff canteen of gujarat state road transport corporation. more popularly known as namo among the rank and file of the ruling bharatiya janata party, modi, over the decade, has taken pains to make the bjp a political force. during the decade, he served as organising secretary of the state unit. it was only modi's political foresight and combativeness that helped the bjp make inroads into congress bastions. the saffron brigade's supremacy was established in a state where the party was a non-entity. it had a lone mp, ak patel, from mehsana in 1984. for young narendra, the day began with physical workouts at the rss' keri pitha shakha, where he came in contact with jan sangh stalwarts such as the late vasant gajendragadkar and nathalal jaghda, who, later, were the founder-members of the bjp in 1980. he stayed in his canteen at gsrtc till he was inducted as full- time pracharak and moved to rss' dr hedgewar bhavan headquarters in dhor bazaar area of the city. it was in 1985 that modi was deputed by the rss to the bjp. this proved a blessing for the party, which had emerged as an effective rival to the congress which was ruling the roost under the leadership of veterans such as madhavsinh solanki and jinabhai darji. a good orator, as organising secretary, modi succeeded in luring young intellectuals to the bjp's city unit. his continuous guidance made bjp wrest power in the ahmedabad municipal corporation. this was the foothold which modi used in successive years to make a bid for power in the state. in 1990, when the party secured more than 60 seats at assembly elections, the bjp formed a coalition government headed by the late chimanbhai patel of the janata dal. however, the two parted ways in the wake of demolition of the babri majid in 1992. thanks to a sound political acumen and an in-depth study of caste system in gujarat, modi halked out the political strategy that yielded results at the 1995 assembly election, where the bjp bagged 121 out of 182 seats. this victory added one more feather to modi's cap. he became powerful, thanks to delhi's patronage. his word was final in the bjp; none challenge it. but after the stunning victory, the ruling party had to face a major revolt when shankersinh vaghela ousted chief minister keshubhai patel. that created serious problems for modi, who was asked to leave gujarat. modi, for his style of functioning and his interference in governance, was held responsible for the crisis. since then, he has largely restricted himself to new delhi but was called to campaign for the 1998 assembly elections, when he addressed nearly 120 public meetings. however, soon after keshubhai became chief minister for the second time, it was made very clear to modi that he should not interfere in gujarat affairs. developments of the last week have once again brought him into the limelight. this may give him an opportunity to do what he wants most, and knows best. calling the shots in gujarat.
