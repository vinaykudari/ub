2,Nabard pumps in Rs 860 crore for rural development,"AHMEDABAD: National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (Nabard) has during the year ended March 2003 provided assistance of Rs 860 crore to rural financial institutions in Gujarat for agriculture and allied activities, as well as for rural non-farm activities.

Nabard supports the rural financial institutions (RFIs) to augment their resources for ground-level credit for agriculture and rural non-farm sectors by way of providing refinance to these institutions.

The Gujarat State Co-operative Bank (GSCB), Gujarat State Co-operative Agriculture and Rural Development Bank (GSCARDB), commercial banks and regional rural banks (RRBs) depend on Nabard to augment their resources.

A Nabard press release said this has helped in creating additional employment in rural areas and prevented migration to cities. With an encouraging forecast for monsoon this year, the need for ground-level credit for agriculture and allied activities is expected to increase. For this, RFIs will have to take a large share.

Nabard, in turn, will support the demand for accelerated refinance from these institutions.

Recognising the importance of rural infrastructure, the Government of India has entrusted the responsibility on Nabard to extend financial support to state governments for development of rural infrastructure.

Taking this into consideration, Nabard has extended financial assistance to the Gujarat government for construction of check dams, other minor and medium irrigation projects, rural roads and bridges, rural drinking water, inter-basin transfer of surplus water from Narmada dam to North Gujarat region and Gokul gram.

An aggregate amount of Rs 1,718 crore has been sanctioned to the state government under these schemes, out of which an amount of Rs 1,074 crore has been availed by the state government for development of rural infrastructure.

Nabard also provides financial assistance to the government for contribution to share capital of co-operative institutions in the state.

Nabard has laid special emphasis on exploitation of irrigation potentials, farm mechanisation, soil and water conservation measures, water-saving devices like drip and sprinkle irrigation, laying of underground pipelines, green-house technology, tissue culture, hybrid-seed development programme, and expansion of crop-loaning system.

Around 28 watershed-development projects have been sanctioned in Gujarat, covering an area of 28,000 hectares.

Micro-credit innovations through the dynamics of self-help group mechanism has earned a name for Nabard not only in India, but also in foreign countries.

In Gujarat too the programme has done well ion the formation of more than 26700 Self Help Groups while 13875 of this have been linked with the banks and availed credit to the extent of Rs. 16.08 crore by March 2003.

About 80 NGO partners are involved not only in the formation of SHGs but also training group leaders and field staff of other NGOs.

Nabard has been appointed as nodal agency for implementation of Capital subsidy for technology up-gradation of small scale industry in the country.

Nabard would route the finance through 65 Primary Lending Institutions (PLI) appointed by the Centre. In Gujarat Rajkot District Cooperative Bank, Amreli Jilla Sahakari Bank, Jamnagar-Rajkot Gramin Bank and Kutch Gramin Bank have been identified as PLI.

3,I can work with children since they don't recognise me,"MUMBAI: When the lifelong penchant of an actress turns into a peeve, you can be sure that she''s ready to move from past to present. Waheeda Rehman agrees to an interview on condition that you come without a photographer. ""A photographer would require me to touch up my eyes, etc. That would be tiresome,"" she explains.

Today Rehman''s work with underprivileged children in the field of education doesn''t have anything to do either with well made-up eyes or with an illustrious filmography. In fact, as the goodwill ambassador of Pratham, an NGO that aims at primary education for every child, Rehman is grateful that today''s children have no inkling of her past career. ""I can work with children since they don''t recognise me,"" she says. ""To them, I''m yet another ''aunty''.""

Sometimes, however, their parents and teachers pose a problem when they get excited on recognising the actress of films like Pyasa and Guide. ""This kind of excitement is annoying because it gets us nowhere,"" says Rehman. ""I like having a quiet exchange of ideas with teachers and parents, but sometimes they go crazy, rushing around for autographs and photographs. Often I''ve lost my temper and told them that I''d leave if they didn''t calm down. Once they''re calm, we work well together.""

Rehman joined Pratham in 2001 when she realised after years of trying that there was little she could do single-handedly for primary education. ""Earlier I thought I was doing my bit when I responded to anyone who sent me fan mail asking for money for educating their child,"" she says. ""Later I learnt that this was pointless since most of this money is blown away at parties, rather than educating any child. Then I tried to educate any underprivileged children I came in contact with, but it wasn''t enough. After I saw Pratham volunteers at work I decided to join them.""

Rehman spreads awareness about primary education and raises funds for Pratham. Recently she collected $2 million during a fund-raising campaign in the US. Her star status among NRIs obviously worked hereâ€”autographed CDs of famous songs from her films were auctioned at $1000 each. ""Someone came up with this idea of a CD and tried it out in the US. It''s okay with me since the money will be put to good use,"" she says.

""There was a time when I stayed away from social causes because I was scared of being accused of seeking publicity,"" she continues. ""Now I''m convinced that publicity only helps the cause. I don''t mind being used as a bait to draw in curious audiences since primary education gets a hearing in the bargain.""

After two years of fund-raising, Rehman now plans to involve herself more closely with children. She wants to be allotted one child each from various balwadis and follow their progress personally. ""All children are born with an aptitude for some field or the other. You just have to show them how to dream,"" she says. ""The other day a little girl at a balwadi told me that she wants to become a ''vakil'' (lawyer). Yet she couldn''t tell me the meaning of the word when I asked her. Her simple explanation was that her uncle is a ''vakil'' and he''s given a lot of respect by her community. She wanted to earn that respect too. Such dreams should be fulfilled.""

Rehman feels that dreams, however precocious, should be encouraged rather than scoffed at. She should know, considering one of her favourite dreams for Mumbaiâ€”of rain-water harvestingâ€”remains thwarted in her own colony. ""I feel rain-water harvesting should be a norm in Mumbai''s buildings,"" she says. ""And there''s only social attitude obstructing this. I''ve often broached the topic to my society and suggested that we all contribute to install it in our buildings but they''ve always scoffed at me. They told me if there''s a water shortage, they''ll arrange for a tanker. That''s missing the whole point, isn''t it? I also asked them to issue a notice saying that cars shouldn''t be washed everyday, but they laughed at that too.""

4,DYFI takes out protest march to Marad,"KOZHIKODE: Pro-Left DYFI volunteers on Saturday took out a protest march to the violence-ravaged Marad in Kerala demanding that the UDF government restart the process of rehabilitation in the beach area immediately.

Earlier, inaugurating the march, CPI (M) deputy leader in the state Assembly, Koidyeri Balakrishnan alleged that the government was ""reluctant"" to rehabilitate the displaced families of minority community as it had come to power by ""claiming votes from fascist forces like the RSS"".

5,Nine booked for fake registration of trucks,"MOGA: The CIA staff of the police have claimed to have unearthed a racket of fake registration of trucks. Some officials of Faridkot district transport office are reported to be involved in the racket.

6,Gambling den raided in Bavla; 19 arrested,"AHMEDABAD: The Rapid Response (RR) team attached with the officer of the DIG (Ahmedabad range) A K Sharma on Friday night raided a gambling den in Bavla and arrested 19 persons.

7,Rehab plan not in sync with land acquisition laws,"CHANDIGARH: The rehabilitation scheme of the UT administration appears to be in disagreement with the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894. The conditions laid down under the Licensing of Tenements, Sites and Services in Chandigarh Scheme, 1979, have taken priority over the Act, rendering futile the very purpose of land acquisition.

Para 4(1) of the rehabilitation scheme states that the competent authority may prepare a phased plan for removal of labour colonies according to the anticipated availability of alternative tenements or sites and may implement such a plan in accordance with the provisions of the scheme.

Section 17 of the Land Acquisition Act, however, specifies that when the collector has made an award under Section 11, he may take possession of the land, which shall vest absolutely in the government, free from all encumbrances. The Act also confers powers on the magistrate to enforce surrender of acquired land. According to Section 47, if the land acquisition collector is opposed or impeded in taking possession of any land under the Act, he can enforce the surrender of the land.

Sections 17 and 47 of the Act make it clear that the collector has absolute powers to take possession of land acquired for a public purpose. And if the administration decides to go by the book, nothing prevents it from bulldozing unauthorised structures on government land. Legal experts said the rehabilitation policy was an executive instruction, which could not dilute the authority of the Act. But when the administration decides to sidestep the Act to abide by the scheme, it amounts to a central government Act being overruled by an executive instruction.

Experts said the scheme could be scrapped if it was working against the Act. A former Punjab advocate-general said the rehabilitation scheme could not claim superiority over the Land Acquisition Act. He said the administration was completely free to remove encroachments from the land for which awards had already been made under the Act. The administration has made awards for the entire 2,285 acres acquired by it during the last 10 years. Section 11 of the Act states the award has to be made within two years from the date of declaration that the land is required for a public purpose.

Prominent high court lawyer M L Sareen said it was not binding on the administration to identify and rehabilitate slum-dwellers before carrying out demolition drives in unauthorised colonies. He said the Act gave the official machinery enough powers to take possession of the acquired land.

A UT administration official admitted that the intensive programme of housing and resettlement of economically weaker sections of society living in slums, as visualised in the rehabilitation scheme, could at best be described as a humanitarian thought which could not negate the provisions of the Act.

8,"Rice smelling, minister says after mid-day meal","MANGALORE: Taking the cue from Karnataka chief minister S.M. Krishna and KPCC president B.Janardhana Poojary, the district in-charge minister and minister for transport B. Ramanath Rai, on Saturday, visited school children of Kinnikambla model higher primary school in Gurpura hobli on the outskirts of Mangalore to sample the mid-day meal being provided as part of the ''Akshara Dasoha'' scheme.

He admitted, the rice served in the school smelt foul.

After a sumptuous meal with the children which comprised an extra sweet (courtesy the minister''s visit), Rai expressed satisfaction on implementation of the scheme in the district. Asked about the quality of the meal, Rai told a group of journalists accompanying him, the rice was giving out a light foul smell. But there was no cause for worry, he added.

At the Addor Higher Primary school where he stopped next, the minister himself served the students their food. He said he was personally monitoring the programme.

Earlier in the day, Rai disbursed relief to as many as 41 families under the natural calamities fund, at a function held in Kandavara Gram Panchayat Hall near Gurpur. While one family received a sum of Rs 50,000 as compensation for the death of Thomas D''Souza, who slipped into the Phalguni river in November 2002, Rs 1,04,040 was disbursed to 40 families whose houses were fully or partially damaged during the flash floods that hit the district recently.

On the occasion, Rai mentioned a review was being conducted on farm losses in the district due to flash floods and relief will be provided to farmers once the report was submitted. With regard to damaged roads, he instructed the concerned departments to patch up the roads temporarily and subsequently get into repair work.

He appealed to voluntary organisations and society at large to co-operate with the government in helping the needy.

Zilla Panchayat member T. Hussain, chairman of standing committee on Health, Education and Social Justice of Zilla Panchayat, Yashavanthi Alva, former mayor of Mangalore City Corporation, Hilda Alva among others were present on the occasion.

9,Gulbarga lawyers meet governor on HC Bench issue,"GULBARGA: A delegation of the Gulbarga District Bar Association, under the leadership of Karnataka PWD Minister Dharam Singh, met governor T.N. Chaturvedi here on Saturday and urged him to use his good offices to convince the judiciary about the need for establishing a high court bench in Gulbarga.

The delegation noted that establishing a high court bench in any other district of North Karnataka would not help the people of Gulbarga and Bidar districts.

The Jaswant Singh Committee, appointed by the Union government a few years ago, had recommended establishing a high court bench in Gulbarga. The state cabinet had also recommended this when Mr. Bangarappa was chief minister, they noted.

They contended that Gulbarga had all infrastructure for setting up a high court bench. The governor is learnt to have promised to consider the demand sympathetically. Bijapur

10,"Centre, Bengal locked in CAS politics","KOLKATA: Is the CAS (conditional access system) saga taking a political turn in West Bengal? For one, there are indications that the Left Front government is preparing a fresh strategy to counteract the political mileage that the BJPled government may derive (during the forthcoming polls) through its proposal of putting a Rs 72 (plus taxes) cap on monthly cable bills.

Officially, CPI(M) honchos refuse to go on record about any such move being incorporated up the sleeves of the high command but off-therecord conversations reveal that specific approaches are indeed being worked out.

Says a Left Front leader, â€œThe official line is that the state government is adopting a wait-and-watch policy. But we are trying to arrive at a consensus on how we should proceed on this issue (of CAS).â€� Then of course, there is the purported move by a little-known political party that has registered itself with the Election Commission of India as Jana Unnayan Mancha (JUM).

Although JUM has bagged three seats in the recently held state Panchayat elections, the party has made it clear that its claim to public fame over the coming months will be through CAS. To kickstart its state-wide, ground-level activities JUM convened its first-ever public forum on CAS on Saturday where it has invited senior political leaders to share the dais with a host of prominent personalities and workers, cutting across party colours. The aim of the forum, according to JUMâ€™s state secretary Ramanimohan Nag Chowdhury, was â€œto protect consumer interest as the issue (of CAS) concerns policy matters involving public opinion.â€�

The newly formed party, headed by former sheriff of Kolkata Prof. Sanat Biswas, will focus on other massbased, political issues over the coming weeks. Says Mala Banerjee, a consumer activist and one of the prime driving forces behind JUM, â€œOur party (JUM) comprises well-educated members who are engineers, doctors, scientists and the like. Our objective is to try and bring a neutral colour to the stateâ€™s electorate. And CAS is providing our first forum towards that purpose.â€�

Earlier, the Left Front government had made its anti-BJP stance clear when it had opposed July 15 as the implementation date for CAS. The state governmentâ€™s position assumed significance at that time as West Bengal became the second state in the country (after Delhi CM Sheila Dixitâ€™s similar line) to publicly maintain that the July 14 deadline for CAS implementation may not be possible after all. In the final analysis â€” with general elections scheduled next year â€” it appears CAS is now threatening to snowball into a major political issue in the state, if not elsewhere in the country.

According to sources, Sunil Singh was declared elected from Gopalganj defeating Mukul Rai. Prabhunath finished third.

12,Man survives suicide bid at Metro station,"KOLKATA: A 33-year-old unidentified man tried to commit suicide by jumping on the Metro rail track at the Esplanade station at 5:38 pm on Saturday. He, however, survived and has been admitted to the SSKM Hospital with minor injuries.

Just as the Tollygunge-bound train was arriving at the station, the young man rushed down the stairs and jumped on the tracks, catching the police by surprise. â€œHowever, he landed inside the drain between the tracks and escaped getting crushed by the train,â€� officer in-charge of Metro Railway Police at Esplanade Station, J.P. Singh, said. On seeing the man, the driver slammed the brakes immediately.

â€œWhen we pulled out the victim from the drain, he was covered with muck and there was blood on one side of his face, probably because he had hurt himself on the hard concrete edges of the drain. He was unconscious,â€� Singh said. He said the victim seemed to belong to an affluent family. The victim has been admitted to the new casualty ward of the SSKM Hospital under the supervision of S.K. Saha. Train services were disrupted between 5:38 pm and 6:12 pm.

â€œElectricity was completely cut off and passengers had to suffer inside the train as even the doors of the compartments could not be opened.â€� The Metro has emerged as the cityâ€™s top suicide spot with 13 deaths from 25 attempts in 2002. In 2003, four persons have already attempted suicide, with two deaths.

So far, 43 people have died on the Metro tracks. Significantly, since its inauguration in October 24, 1984 till July 13, 1987, the Metro Railway had not experienced a single suicide. Now, it continues to plague the railways consistently.

13,NCW wants new law on marriage,"HYDERABAD: The National Commission for Women (NCW) wants a legislation making it mandatory registration of marriages between Indian women and foreigners. The NCW wants these marriages to be registered at consulates in the respective countries.

This was stated by NCW chairperson Dr Poornima Advani. She was participating in a seminar on disturbing developments related to Indian women marrying Non-resident Indians and foreigners here on Saturday.

She said there should be an attitudinal change among Indian parents and the craze for â€œinstant marriageâ€� should stop. â€œWhile offering their daughters in marriage to NRIs is not wrong, they should agree for it only after the antecedents of the prospective bride groom are fully verified,â€™â€™ she said.

Osmania Universityâ€™s professor of law V Nageswara Rao said the problem arises as marriages in India are performed according to the Hindu Marriage Act, which does not apply in a foreign land. There were places like Mexico where divorce could be obtained for a song, he added. In most cases, the husbands do not even want custody of the children, he added.

Dr Renuka Datla of Uniqare Hospitals and Somaraju Suseela, an industrialist, also expressed similar feelings and asked parents â€œnot to be greedyâ€�.

14,Indian airlines oppose open skies policy,"NEW DELHI: With a growing demand from several foreign carriers for India to extend its ''open skies'' policy for a longer period, public sector Indian carriers feel their operations and profitability will be affected if such a decision is taken.

Foreign governments, especially those from the Gulf, South and South-East Asia, have been asking for round-the-year open skies from the Indian government so that their national carriers could funnel the traffic from here to their home base and carry it to various points beyond their hubs.

Sources in Indian Airlines and Air-India said that most of the airlines, like those from Singapore, Malaysia, Dubai and Sri Lanka, focussed on carrying passengers from India and bound for the US, Europe or Australia, over their respective hubs.

They said that allowing them free access to the Indian market would enable them to not only fill up their flights from their hubs, but also allow them to play around with the traffic and yields on the end-to-end market.

The foreign airlines would have the spare capacity on the end-to-end market and affect the long haul operations of Indian Airlines and Air-India, the sources felt.

While the government has been following a permanent ''open skies'' policy for cargo services, it has been declaring ''open skies'' during peak seasons for about four to five months during the past few years.

15,Ananth vows to pursue development projects in state,"BANGALORE: A day after being relieved of his duties as Union minister, BJP state chief Ananth Kumar vowed to pursue the development projects initiated by him for the state.

""Just because I quit the post of a minister, it does not mean that I have lost interest in the state''s welfare. I will maintain pressure on the Centre till projects such as Bangalore Metro Rail are implemented,"" he told a press conference here on Sunday.

Rejecting the argument that he was supportive of Chief Minister S M Krishna on some issues, he said: ""Be it Almatti dam, Chitravathi water supply scheme, Cauvery dispute, railway zone or Bangalore international airport, I am with the state. It is my duty to defend the interests of the state"".

Referring to former Prime Minister H D Deve Gowda''s allegation that BJP had a secret pact with the Congress in Karnataka, he said his party considered the Congress as its political rival. ""We do not believe in illusions or assumptions. Our aim is to decimate Congress,"" he added.

Victory: Kumar said he would channelise his energies to lead the party to the victory podium in the next Parliamentary and Assembly polls.

""Our party leader made it clear after BJP''s Chintan Baithak that we should be prepared for Parliamentary polls any time. I will work seven days a week to achieve my single-point target -- victory. We are raring to fight the elections,"" he said.

The party had already commenced a whirlwind tour of the state to garner support. ""People have realised that BJP is the only alternative to Congress. Now, our aim is to consolidate it by widening our party''s social bandwidth and increasing geographical reach,"" he added.

He pointed out that the party would harp on the achievements of NDA government at the Centre and failures of the Congress government in Karnataka.

""We have a strong cadre even at the village level. Our share of voters are increasing. The plan is to capitalise on both these advantages,"" he said.

17,Clear dues on crop insurance: BJP to govt,"BANGALORE: Accusing the Congress government of committing ""fraud"" on farmers, state BJP campaign committee chairman B S Yediyurappa on Sunday demanded clearance of crop insurance dues in the next 10 days.

""Farmers are in dire straits after three consecutive droughts. The crop insurance due to the farmers is Rs 309.41 crore, out of which only Rs 29.41 crore has been cleared. This smacks of arrogance,"" he said while addressing a press conference here.

He alleged that government officials were delaying clearance of crop insurance for no reason. ""They say that verification of crop loss claims is still on. But how long will it take and should farmers eternally wait for the insurance amount?"" he asked.

Yediyurappa demanded that crop insurance amount be cleared in the next 8-10 days so that farmers can invest it in agriculture.

He alleged the government had scant respect for the opposition. ""We are consulted only for the sake of formalities. None of our suggestions are considered seriously. Discussions in the legislature have lost value. I hope the government will take the opposition''s views seriously in the ensuing session,"" he said.

For instance, ""we had sought a ''drought relief fund'' for farmers, but nothing came of it"", the BJP leader charged.

''Table report'': Pointing out that the Lok Ayukta had submitted independent reports on irregularities in drought relief works in all 27 districts, Yediyurappa insisted that all the reports be tabled before the legislature.

""If there is even slight hesitation in tabling the reports, we will be compelled to assume that the government is trying to protect the corrupt,"" he said.
