0,CPI-M's Kerala unit charge against UDF govt,"KOCHI: CPI(M)''s Kerala unit secretary, Pinarayi Vijayan on Monday alleged that the state government was not interested in the rehabilitation of the families, which had fled Marad fearing retaliation.

Addressing a press conference here, he flayed Chief minister A K Antony for his statement that no force would be used to restore peace, and charged that this statement was a license for the communal forces to continue their activities.

The violent incidents at Kozhikode, Kunnamangalam, Perambra and the attack on KPCC President K Muraleedharan''s vehicle were the after effects of the statement, he alleged.

What the government should have done was to arrest all those involved in the Marad killings and speed up the judicial probe process he said, adding it should also take necessary steps to bring peace at Marad.

On the killing of a CMP worker at Kollam on Sunday, allegedly by CPI-M activists, he said party would make an inquiry.

On whether SNDP''s decision to float a political forum would affect CPI-M, Vijayan said it will not have any impact on his party.

1,Defeated SAD candidate sets polling party truck on fire,"MANSA: Peeved at his defeat in the panchayat elections, a Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) supported candidate set a truck of polling party in Gehle village of Mansa district on fire on the intervening night of Sunday and Monday.

While three members of the polling party suffered serious burn injuries and were shifted to Christian Medical College and Hospital Ludhiana, three other members have been admitted at Civil Hospital, Mansa. Mansa police have identified about 20 persons, including the defeated candidate Bogha Singh as the prime accused and 15 of them were rounded up on Monday.

The incident happened at 12.05 am on Monday when a truck (SR-23-951), deputed by the district administration, was picking up the members of the polling parties from various villages after the panchayat results were declared. At around 11.00 pm, the truck reached Gehle village after collecting the ballot boxes and polling party members from three villages.

After announcing the result of Gehle village panchayat in favour of Darshan Singh, a Congress supported candidate, when the polling party members were placing the ballot boxes in the truck all of sudden a mob of about 20 persons attacked the truck and set it on fire, sprinkling some inflammable liquid, said district police chief S Srivastava. The mob was allegedly being headed by Bhoga Singh.

At that time six persons, including Joginder Pal Singh, a station house officer (SHO) and Darshan Lal, a constable, were also travelling in the truck. The injured have been identified as Binder Singh, Sukhdev Singh, Jasvir Singh, all polling party members, Bhola Singh, truck driver, the SHO and the constable. The policemen and Jasvir Singh, a draftsman in Mansa divisional soil conservation office, have been referred to Ludhiana.

The police have registered a criminal case under Sections 307, 352, 435, 427, 148, 149, 120-B of the IPC (attempt of murder) against Bhoga Singh, Darshan Singh, Sher Singh, Tega Singh, Jagga Singh, Pala Singh, Cheena Singh, Simaranjeet Singh and Bhaga Singh.

Mansa deputy commissioner Raj Kanwal Chaudhary said that the treatment expenses of the injured would be borne by the district administration. He announced a monetary relief of Rs 10,000 to those seriously injured and Rs 5,000 to others.

Sources said that as a ballot box of Maujia village panchayat election was burnt in the fire, the district administration has decided to re-conduct polling in Maujia village.

3,"Dharwad farmers despair, desperate","HUBLI: Natural and man-made conditions in the region have become a cause of despair for farmers in Dharwad district. Due to poor rainfall and failure of the government to supply sufficient seeds, farmers are in a tight spot.

Exploiting the desperation of farmers, who are faced with inadequate supply of subsidised seeds distributed by the government, private seed companies are virtually minting money by selling substandard seeds at exorbitant prices.

An overwhelming number of farmers alleged that they have not received subsidised seeds even in the peak sowing season. Bhusappanavar, a farmer from Kalghatgi, lamented that there would be no use if the government supplies subsidised seeds after the prime cultivation time was over.

He alleged that the state government has failed to come to the rescue of drought-ravaged farmers for the fourth-consecutive year.

Kulkarni, a technical assistant of Agriculture Department, Dharwad, however maintained that they have ensured that the farmers procure adequate seeds through Karnataka State Oil seed Corporation.

Paddy, cotton, soya, green gram, gingelly, sajja, jowar and sunflower are the main crops in kharif season.

Cotton is grown on 30,000 acres, gingelly on 17,000 acres, paddy on 50,000 acres and chilli on 25,000 acres, apart from the customary crops.

Though the total cultivated area is about 2.5 lakh hectares in the district, the Agriculture Departmentâ€™s mission this time was to reach the target of 1.67 lakh hectares. Good spell of rains at the beginning of the kharif season inspired many farmers in the region to take up extensive cultivation. They bought seeds from private companies, hoping to get good returns. Their condition is hopeless now since monsoons were short. Why are the farmers so apprehensive? According to R. Savadatti, a progressive farmer, usually, the farmers spend huge amounts of money for the initial stage of cultivation. These expenses are for fertilisers, pesticides, sowing, labour charges and for tillage. Cotton farmers spend about Rs 10,000 to Rs 15,000 per hectare. Despite spending huge amounts, the farmers are not getting benefits from the crop.

The district has been witnessing drought for the past four years and this year too, there is no sign of rains crossing the average barrier.

Moreover, he said the farmers were unable to go for alternative crops. Last year, farmers who opted for horticulture suffered huge losses due to various technical and geographical reasons.

Worse still, several farmers were unable to get crop insurance when their crops fail. Banks and other financial institutions do not sanction huge amounts for non-commercial crops. Left with no alternative, the farmers take loans on the pretext of growing commercial crops and invest money and labour for growing non-commercial crops.

If the crops fail, they have to repay their loans with interest, mostly by pledging land or ornaments. Initial enthusiasm turns burdensome for farmers, added Savdatti.

Farmers cannot always opt for commercial crops like dal, cotton, chilli and fruits because the crops require huge quantity of water, which has become scarce over the years.

With no proper irrigation facilities or sufficient rainfall and depleting ground water reserves in the district, hopes are bleak for the farmers in kharif season. Lakhs of farmers are anxiously waiting for better conditions in July.

4,HC gives govt 75 pc seats in non-minority institutions,"BANGALORE: The Karnataka High Court on Monday upheld the state government''s admission rules for professional courses and said the government had the right to fill 75 per cent seats in private unaided non-minority institutions and 50 per cent seats in private unaided minority institutions, through the Common Entrance Test (CET).

Clarifying that the interim order would apply only for 2003-04, the division bench comprising Justices R.V. Raveendran and K.L. Manjunath said professional college managements should adopt a fair and reasonable selection process based on merit to fill seats under its quota as per the decision of the Supreme Court in the TMA Pai Foundation case.

The bench also specified the fee â€” Rs 1.9 lakh for medical, Rs 1.1 lakh for dental and Rs 36,000 for engineering courses. The orders were passed on a batch of petitions filed by minority, non-minority unaided institutions and the Consortium of Medical, Engineering and Dental Colleges (Comed).

Of the 75 per cent seats to be filled through CET, 25 per cent should be set aside as reservation seats, 40 per cent for Karnataka students and 10 per cent for non-Karnataka seats. â€œThe fee would be uniform for all students except those selected under the reservation seats, for which colleges should extend scholarship up to 80 per cent of the fee, with students paying only 20 per cent of the amount,â€™â€™ the bench said.

In private unaided minority colleges, 50 per cent seats should be filled by the state government through the CET cell and 50 per cent by the managements. Of the 50 per cent to be filled by the CET Cell, 25 per cent should be set aside as reservation seats and 25 per cent for Karnataka candidates.

Government seats should be filled through the CET cell, and application of selection rules. Colleges should admit students based on merit. â€œMerit may be determined either with reference to marks secured in the qualifying examination or by conducting its own entrance test. It is also open to evolve a scheme of ascertainment of merit with reference to marks secured in the qualifying examination and interview in the proportion of 90 per cent and 10 per cent respectively,â€™â€™ the bench said.

The fee structure is only an interim measure and subject to further or final orders in these petitions. Each college should submit a fee structure with details of infrastructure, facilities and other particulars to the court within 15 days, and submit copies to the state government and the fee regulatory committee.

â€œThe fee committee or the state can seek clarifications and further information from respective colleges to arrive at the suggested fee structure. The committee will examine it and submit its recommendations to this court within 45 days,â€™â€™ the bench added.

Arguing before the bench, Comed suggested 50:50 seat-sharing arrangement between the government and managements. The government refused the Comed proposal and said it should be allowed to fill 75 per cent seats. Comed was represented by Delhi-based advocates Kapil Sibal and Rajeev Dhawan.

5,Many people queue up for election I-cards in A'bad,"AHMEDABAD: It was with a triumphant smile that Anjana Shah (name changed) walked out of the AMC school number 4 here on Monday. She is no student, but a resident of the Ellisbridge constituency near Natraj Cinema who had to brave the heat and computer glitches for hours before she got her election identity card.

Like her, many residents in this area complained that glitches in the computer delayed the process of taking photographs. Many had to visit the school four to five times.

â€œThe computer that takes the photograph was not working properly. I had to come here three times, first at 9 am then at 1.30 pm now at 7 pmâ€�, said a woman who had to ask her neighbour to baby-sit her fiveyear-old while she got her Icard done.

Collector Anita Karwal says the Designated Photographic Locations (DPLs) have received a good response from the residents.

â€œIf there is a technical hitch,we have a technical team that has to rush to the spot. I have not received any complaint.

But we want more people to get their names registered and we want to ensure that the electoral list is updated and identity cards are issuedâ€� she added.

The electoral rolls upgradation programme is on in 15 constituencies. It has picked up well, she said.

6,"Bakery verdict: NHRC, govt face off","NEW DELHI/ GANDHINAGAR: Taking suo motu cognisance of the acquittal of all 21 accused in the Best Bakery carnage in the post-Godhra communal violence, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) on Monday asked the Gujarat government to inform it of the steps it proposes to take against the acquittal order, even as an international human rights organisation accused the state government of â€œsabotaging investigations into the riotsâ€�.

â€œThe chief secretary of the Gujarat government shall inform the commission as to what steps, if any, the Gujarat government is proposing to take against the order of acquittal,â€� the NHRC, headed by Justice AS Anand said after a full commission meeting in New Delhi. â€œFrom newspaper reports, it appears that all the accused in what came to be known as Best Bakery case have been acquitted,â€� the commission observed, seeking a copy of the judgment within a week.

On being contacted, Vadodara district government pleader Raghuvir Pandya, who is supposed to initiate the process if the government has to appeal against the judgment, refused to commit himself on the issue. â€œI have yet to go through the papers of the case,â€� he told TNN. â€œBest Bakery is a big case and it will take me some time to place my papers before the government through the proper channels,â€� he said.

The Gujarat government is likely to decide on how to react to the NHRCâ€™s query about an appeal on Tuesday. State chief secretary PK Laheri, who received a fax message from the NHRC on Monday, may meet senior officials of the home department and the police after the completion of the Rath Yatra on Tuesday afternoon. Laheri was unable to see the NHRC letter on Monday as he was preoccupied with the Rath Yatra preparations, officials said.

The state home department maintains that till it officially receives the judgment from the additional sessions court, â€œnothing can be said in the matterâ€�. Meanwhile, the US-based Human Rights Watch has charged the Gujarat government with sabotaging the investigation in the post-Godhra riots and urged the central government to probe the large-scale killings.

7,BJP remembers Ram only during polls: Kalyan Singh,"LUCKNOW: Treating Ram as a voter will take BJP nowhere. This was stated by RKP president Kalyan Singh on Friday, while talking to TNN. Singh slammed the saffron party for chanting â€˜Ram naamâ€™ only at the time of election and choosing to ignore the same for the next five years.

Ramjanmabhoomi issue, he pointed out, could either be solved by negotiation or by a judicial verdict. Trying to enforce it through show of might would only complicate matters and vitiate communal harmony in the state, he said.

Hailing the attempts made by the Kanchi seer to sort out the contentious issue, Singh said it could pave the way for a bright future. The right approach would be to involve Hindu and Muslim heads, who had no political affiliation and try for a amicable solution, mutually acceptable to each community, he declared .

He further said the VHP was trying to put obstacles in peace attempts, as solving of the Ayodhya dispute would spell doom to its â€œfinancial wheeling dealingâ€�.

Calling the home minister a villain â€œwho orchestrated all trouble by launching his Rath Yatra from Somnath to Ayodhyaâ€�, Singh said that de-politicising the issue was the only way out. TNN

8,Smart showers mar rally in Ranchi,"RANCHI: Heavy showers on Monday afternoon played spoilsport during the much-hyped ""Kranti rally"" organised by the Jharkhand Front. The programme started three hours behind schedule and also marked low attendance of party workers at Morabadi ground.

Earlier, the renegade BJP MP from Mayurbhanj seat in Orissa, Salkhan Murmu, announced that he had left the party only to strengthen people''s revolt against the unpopular Jharkhand government.

Salkhan also pulled up Arjun Munda and the previous Babulal Marandi governments for adopting a lackadaisical attitude towards reservation and domicile policy. Both the BJP leaders had failed in clearing the mist over the issues even after the lapse of over two-and-a-half years, said Salkhan, the founder of Jharkhand Disom Party â€” a constituent of Jharkhand Front.

CPI-ML legislator and special invitee to the rally, Mahendra Singh, exhorted the like-minded parties to come on a common platform to fight for the rights of adivasis and moolvasis of Jharkhand.

Terming the rally to be a step towards the recreation of Jharkhand, Singh said BJP and RSS were the main threats to democracy throughout the country and both the outfits had played with the sentiments of locals over the domicile and reservation issues and the time had come to teach them a lesson.

Both the leaders also termed the rally to be the beginning of a revolt against the BJP which would end with its ouster from power in Jharkhand.

9,A village awaits a PW-govt dialogue,"BHEERPUR (Karimnagar): The villagers of Bheerpur, the birthplace of Peopleâ€™s War (PW) supremo Muppala Lakshmana Rao, alias Ganapati, expressed divergent views when asked to react on the topic â€˜Is there a solution to the naxalite problem?â€™

While some farmers suggested a dialogue between the PW and the government, women wanted an end to the bloodshed and the young felt that the situation would change once the problem was viewed from a socio-economic angle.

Despite being the native place of Ganapati, the village had kept relatively aloof from the war of attrition between the naxalites and police except on one occasion, when a jeep was mistakenly blown up by the extremists in the late 80s.

The naxalite movement in this area,which emerged with the Jatial farmers struggle, helped the labourer secure rightful wages. Later, when local residents â€” Odelu, Lakshman Rao and Narayan Rao joined the outfit, the situation here transformed and people began to take note of the movement.

â€œThough the PW movement never took a violent turn here, it proved to be a hurdle for us and gave a rude jolt to the development of the village,â€� said Samudrala Lakshmi, 55, mother of a detenue Samudrala Mallesham who is serving life imprisonment in Warangal jail. The current impasse could be resolved only with an unconditional dialogue, she added.

MPTC member J Bhagyamma, sarpanch Masatthi Jamuna and upa sarpanch B Anjaneyulu said the villagers, until 2001, were of the opinion that police would not hear their grievances. But the local issues were solved amicable after R Praveen Kumar took over charge district SP, they said, pointing out that a proper initiation from the government and dialogue under conducive atmosphere were needed.

Vana Samraskhana Samithi chairman of Bheerpur Sherneni Ganganna and Single Window cooperative chief Akkinepalli Venugopal and DWCRA group leader Buchamma reacted similarly.When asked why should the government come forward, they said a responsible wing must take the initiative for a solution.

Some young men and women, while pleading anonymity, asked the government to play a fair game if any dialogue to be initiated to resolve the problem.

10,Medicos to protest 'scapegoat' action,"KOLKATA: â€˜Protestâ€™ will be the language for doctors in West Bengal on Tuesday, observed in the state as Doctorsâ€™ Day.

Speaking to TNN on the eve of the birth anniversary of former chief minister and legendary doctor, Bidhan Chandra Roy, doctors said they were feeling insecure as they believed that medicos in the state had been m a d e scapegoats to cover up a fragile health care delivery system in the state.

The death of over 40 children in Murshidabad was a case in point, they said. â€œA doctor is as good as the system,â€� one claimed on Monday, talking about the suspension orders issued by the state government for three health services doctors in Murshidabad.

While the Indian Medical Association (Bengal) are threatening a strike if the suspension orders are not withdrawn, IMA Kolkata are holding rallies to protest the suspension.

Even the CPM-backed doctorâ€™s union, Association of Health Services Doctors, feel the doctors were made scapegoats.

They say it was a ploy to distract attention from a fragile health care system.

â€œWe will in go for a strike if the government does not withdraw the suspension. Some of the suspended doctors had applied for voluntary retirement and were to be released,â€� said IMA B e n g a l secretary, Maloy Patra.

Doctors from IMA headquarters, along with members of voluntary health associations will participate in a rally on July 5. The rally will start from Calcutta Medical College and Hospital.

â€œNone of the health centres were equipped to handle such emergencies. Most doctors were discontented as there was no oxygen and not even Paracetamol syrup. Under these circumstances, what can a doctor do?â€� IMA headquarters joint secretary R. Dubey said.

11,Hired assassin shot dead as groups clash,"HYDERABAD: A hired assassin was shot dead and three others injured when two rival groups attacked each other in broad daylight with firearms and swords in Khajaguda village of Rangareddy district on Monday.

The dead man is yet to be identified while three persons â€” Naveen Goud, Eshwar Goud and Shankar Goud â€” have been admitted to hospital. Another person, Ravi Goud, was taken into custody.

According to police, the fight took place when a group of six persons led by Naveen Goud and his brother Ravi arrived in a jeep at the municipal grounds in Khajaguda where a toddy society meeting comprising about 100 members including Shankar Goud, was on.

The assailants attacked Shankar and his men with swords. In retaliation, Shankar took out his revolver and shot at the assailants. One of them was hit by a bullet. Naveen and his group then fled the spot leaving the jeep behind. They stopped a tipper truck passing by and boarded the vehicle. However, about a kilometre away from the grounds, the body of the person who had received a bullet injury was found.

Naveen was later admitted to the Osmania General Hospital by his relatives. Shankar, who also sustained injuries, was rushed to a private hospital.

Ravi, who was arrested, reportedly told police that the man killed was a hired assassin and that he had given him Rs 5,000 to carry out the operation. The attack was an attempt to avenge the killing of Praveen Kumar Goud,who was killed by Shankar and his men in October last, following a fight for supremacy in real estate deals and toddy contracts around Rayadurgam, police said.

13,MLA arrested in fake stamp-paper probe,"PUNE: In a significant development in the Rs 3,000-crore fake stamp-paper probe, Samajwadi Janata Party''s Dhule MLA, Anil alias Anna Gote (54), was arrested by the Special Investigation Team (SIT) on Sunday night and booked under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA).

He was remanded to police custody till July 14 by judicial magistrate first class (JMFC) M.N. Bondre.

Gote was called by the SIT for interrogation at its base at the Pune SRPF (group II) headquarters on Sunday and later arrested.

While pressing for his police custody, special public prosecutor Raja Thakare said Gote, who is a sitting MLA from Dhule, had used political clout to help the organised syndicate of Abdul Karim Telgi, the alleged kingpin of the stamp-paper racket.

Thakare said Gote had links with Telgi since 1993 and despite Telgi being declared a proclaimed offender, he maintained relations with him. Gote also helped Telgi obtain the first stamp vendor''s licence using his political clout, Thakre said.

He told the court that Gote had made Telgi a trustee of the Kisan Trust in Dhule in violation of a rule which states that a trustee must be a resident of Dhule.

The public prosecutor said the relationship between Gote and Telgi needed to be investigated as they had close financial dealings involving trust funds. Telgi''s firm, Thane Polyorganic, was run by Gote''s son, Tejas, and brother-in-law, Nilesh Kelkar, as partners along with Telgi, the prosecutor charged.

Thakare said Gote had tried to fabricate some of the records and had tried to destroy evidence.

14,NRI signs pact with govt for thermal plant,"KOLKATA: Non-resident Bengali Prasun Mukherjee signed a memorandum of understanding with the West Bengal government on Monday for setting up a 10 MW thermal power plant at Dishergarh in Burdwan district.

The facility will be set up jointly by Mukherjeeâ€™s Universal Sussex and Jakarta-based firm Kaltimex Energi at a cost of $12 million. â€œIf everything goes well,we will set up the power plant within the next two years. In July, we will visit the proposed site at Dishergarh,â€� Indonesia-based Mukherjee told newspersons on Monday.

At the initial stage it was decided that the power to be produced by the proposed unit would be purchased by Dishergarh power company, an associate of Andrew Yule.

Kaltimex Energi will form a joint venture company with Mukherjeeâ€™s Universal Sussex to set up the power plant at Dishergarh. Kaltimexâ€™s president director K.K. Ralhan said 30 to 40 per cent of the total project cost would be funded by them. The rest would come from international banks as loans. Kaltimex had already set up power plants in Indonesia, Australia, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.

â€œIn these countries we have suffered a huge loss. But we hope the Dishergarh project will be a profit making project ,â€� Ralhan said.

â€œThe political situation in the state is stable. This is an important reason for our decision to set up the power plant.

The chief minister has been inspiring us for investments in West Bengal. We have plans to set more power plants in the state if Dishergarh project turned into a success,â€� Mukherjee said.

Mukherjee has also shown a willingness to take over the ailing Great Eastern Hotel. On his dream project, the Kolkata multiplex, he said that the state government was examining the possibility of allocating land at Tollygunge.

15,Hope for incomplete flyover,"KOLKATA: The Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners was on Monday asked to undertake the construction of Kidderpore flyover immediately.

The flyover has been lying incomplete for more than a decade. During the day mayor Subrata Mukherjee held a meeting with the HRBC chairman Swadesh Chakr-aborty and urged him to take the initiative to complete the unfinished flyover without delay. Later, Mukherjee said he was not convinced with the response from HRBC officials.

â€œIt was a lukewarm response. I doubt whether the flyover will be completed at all,â€� he said. Funds could be a major constraint, Mukherjee felt. If fresh construction was taken up, the KMC would extend cooperation to HRBC authorities, Mukherjee said.

However, the mayor made it clear that if the construction was not taken up, KMC would demolish the existing structure. â€œInstead of solving traffic congestion, the structure was creating problems for all. Rag pickers and hawkers have taken over the flyover.

In such a situation, we canâ€™t sit idle,â€� he added. Mukherjee said the KMC would wait till September to see whether the reconstruction had started. â€œI will take up the issue with the chief minister before we decide to demolish the flyover,â€� he said. He said in all future flyover projects, the civic would have to be consulted.

18,Mob lynches govt official in Gujarat village,"AHMEDABAD: A deputy mamlatdar posted in tribal-dominated Meghraj taluka of Sabarkantha district in North Gujarat met a gory end on Monday evening when the widow of his colleague, who was killed in an accident on Thursday, along with several other villagers abducted him and killed him.

The incident goes back to Thursday evening when deputy mamlatdar Vinod Bhagora was reportedly killed in a road accident after he left office on his motorbike and ran into a pig on his way home, said police sources.

A case of accidental death was lodged, but his family refused to be convinced and suspected that he was murdered.

Their suspicion was in the context of administrative changes which had been effected in this mamlatdar headquarter recently where Vinod Bhagora had been allotted the revenue portfolio in place of deputy mamlatdar Navin Bhagora who was given charge of drought relief.

The latter is said to have been upset at the wresting of the important portfolio from his charge. This is what, the family thought, had led Navin Bhagora to eliminate his colleague.

Refusing to accept Vinod Bhagoraâ€™s death as an accident, his wife Premila, and eight other relatives, including his brother who is a deputy executive engineer at Dahod, got together and launched an attack on the mamlatdar office on Monday around 5.45 pm.

They abducted Navin Bhagora in a jeep, clobbered him to death and flung his body on the outskirts of the nearby Panchal village. A case of murder was registered against all the nine accused at the Meghraj police station based on a complaint by mamlatdar K C Pasaya. The accused were also booked for rioting, conspiracy, abduction and assault of a government official.

""The post-mortem is being conducted and we are yet to arrest the accused since some of them are also government servants"", said Sabarkantha superintendent of police D R Patel.

The accused are Premila Bhagora, Popat Bhagora, Vinod Bhagoraâ€™s brother, Kanjibhai Bhagora, Virji Bhagora, Dhulji Menat, Sanja Kalash, Favda Damor and a lady teacher who was not identified.

The Prime Minister himself put in a word pointing to the complementalities between the two countries, one strong in hardware, the other in software.

Both Prime Minister Vajpayee and his Chinese counterpart Wen Jiabao assured each other that they would ensure each others investors and businessmen equal terms. But, say businessmen, this is easier said than done. Chinese companies have not had an easy ride in India and Indian firms sometime complain of discrimination.

Tariff and non-tariff barriers such as restrictions on agricultural produce on phytosanitary grounds are easy to erect as are cases against dumping. This is where the government steps in and ensures, as was done in the recent visit in the case of mangoes, that a regulations regime is in place to make export a possibility. The two governments have also eased the visa regime for easier travel for businessmen. A lot more needs to be done, but it will undoubtedly be calibrated to the state of political relations.

The pragmatic Chinese have not hesitated to import iron ore and steel from India to fulfill their voracious demand. They have been quick to realize India''s comparative advantage in software and welcomed Indian companies like TCS and computer training giant NIIT with open arms. The same has been the case with the pharmaceutical industry. But the Chinese have also sought simultaneously build up their own software industry in a competitive mode.

But now Indian businessmen who accompanied the PM are convinced that there is a change in the Chinese attitude and space has emerged to build synergistic relations in a variety of areas. The sheer pace of Chinese economic growth is so great that the Chinese cannot fulfill their consumption needs, whether it be steel or software from domestic sources. But to build sustainable long-term relations, there is need for a complete political normalisation, not in the near future, but now.

For hard-headed businessmen, in both countries to begin thinking in ''China-India'' terms, rather than as ''China'' and ''India'' the political leadership has to do their bit. The two countries cannot let their border problem remain in the backburner too long. Vajpayee''s visit and the agreements reached have generated a certain momentum and also created a positive climate of opinion which should be used to press for a quick resolution of the issue and it should not be postponed on the pretext of impending elections or some such excuse.

22,'Action against minister if found guilty in scam',"GANDHINAGAR: Minister of state for home Amit Shah on Monday said the state government was inquiring into the alleged involvement of minister of state for cow protection Prabhatsinh Chauhan in the Panchmahals District Cooperative Bank scam case.

When contacted, Shah said the police were also investigating into a criminal case filed against the members of the dissolved board of the bank. He said senior officials of the registrar of co-operatives have also been asked to inquire into the matter.

The state government wonâ€™t hesitate to take any action against Chauhan if he was found guilty in the reports that would be submitted shortly.

However, Shah did not elaborate on the action likely to be taken against the minister saying, â€œIt was too early to predictâ€�.

Chauhan has conveyed to the government that he has nothing to do with the bank since he was not attending the official meetings of the bank, of which he was the vice-chairman, ever since he was inducted into the ministry in December last.

The state government appointed an administrator last month after the bank withdrew from the clearing house following a liquidity crisis.

23,Godhra 'core group' man arrested,"VADODARA/AHMEDABAD: One more person who, the police claim, was a member of the ''core group'' which planned the burning of the Sabarmati Express on February 27 last year, has been arrested.

The Special Investigation Team (SIT) conducting the probe arrested Shoaib Yusuf Kalandar in connection with the execution of the carnage. He was remanded to custody till July 4 by the special Pota court on Tuesday.

Police sources claim there were some 25 persons who actually set the S-6 coach on fire and Kalandar was one of them. Some 13 persons of this ''core team'' have been arrested while the main person, Salim Panwala, is still absconding. Kalandar is said to have been absconding all this while and was picked up from his home in Signal Falia on Monday.

His name cropped up during the interrogation of another accused, Habib Badshah, who was arrested a month ago. The charges against Kalandar as presented before the Pota court were that he was â€œseen near the S-2 coach which was the first coach targeted by this group, and then he proceeded towards S-6 which was finally set ablazeâ€�, said an SIT official.

Special IG (Vadodara range) Rakesh Asthana who is supervising investigations in the case said, â€œHe is one of the persons who torched the train in Godhra.â€�

Asthana said, like many other accused in the Godhra carnage, Kalandar had a criminal background and was involved in petty offences in the town. Six chargesheets have already been filed in this case, the last one being against ''prime conspirator'' Maulana Hussain Umarji.

The SIT on Monday moved an application in the Pota court seeking the release from judicial custody of Syed Anwar Sattar alias ''Kala'' on the grounds that there was no evidence to prove his culpability. He will be the ninth accused to be released in this case under section 169 of the CrPC.

The Pota court passed an order to this effect on Tuesday. Kala, owning the ''New Eros'' transport company, was picked up from Mumbai in April this year, following allegations that he had facilitated hawala transactions for Umarji.

He was booked under section 212 of the IPC for having harboured some of the accused in the carnage.When he was arrested, it was alleged that he had sheltered Godhra municipality former corporator Faroukh Bhana, Salim Panwala and Qadri Pataliya when they escaped to Mumbai on February 27. However, none of this could be proved.

24,Oppn calls for all-party meet against Musharraf,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan''s opposition parties agitating against Pervez Musharraf''s Presidency and his constitutional amendments have called for an all-party meet on July 6 to chalk out a new strategy against him.

The Islamist Muthahida Majlis Amal (MMA), which is spearheading the agitation demanding Musharraf to quit as army Chief called for the all party meet in Lahore on Sunday to carry forward their opposition to his constitutional changes.

The combined opposition, which included MMA, Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) of deposed Prime Minister Nawaz Shairf along with several smaller parties have stalled Parliament proceedings for over six months against Musharraf''s constitutional amendments incorporated in the Legal Framework Order, (LFO).

Last week the opposition failed to muster enough votes in the National Assembly to bring a no confidence motion against the speaker, Amir Hussain. It has now given a fresh notice of no confidence move against Deputy speaker, Sardar Muhamood Yacub, which is scheduled to be taken up next week.

Even though this motion is expected to fail, observers said the move is aimed at disrupting Parliament proceedings.

Opposition parties already said they would continue to bring in no-confidence motions until Musharraf relented and quit as chief of Army.

With these arrests, the CBI said it had nabbed 128 government employees since January this year on corruption charges.

A statement issued by the agency said its Anti-Corruption Branch, responsible for nabbing government employees who demand bribes, had snared 233 corrupt officials, up from 161 in 1999.

The statement said the MES official, A K Gupta, was arrested at Uran in Raigad, Maharashtra, for allegedly demanding and accepting a bribe of Rs 22,500 from a contractor.

26,NRI signs pact with govt for thermal plant,"KOLKATA: Non-resident Bengali Prasun Mukherjee signed a memorandum of understanding with the West Bengal government on Monday for setting up a 10 MW thermal power plant at Dishergarh in Burdwan district.

The facility will be set up jointly by Mukherjeeâ€™s Universal Sussex and Jakarta-based firm Kaltimex Energi at cost of $12 million. â€œIf everything goes well,we will set up the power plant within the next two years. In July, we will visit the proposed site at Dishergarh,â€� Indonesia-based Mukherjee told newspersons on Monday.

At the initial stage it was decided that the power to be produced by the proposed unit would be purchased by Dishergarh power company, an associate of Andrew Yule.

Kaltimex Energi will form a joint venture company with Mukherjeeâ€™s Universal Sussex to set up the power plant at Dishergarh. Kaltimexâ€™s president director K.K. Ralhan said 30 to 40 per cent of the total project cost would be funded by them.

The rest would come from international banks as loans. Kaltimex had already set up power plants in Indonesia, Australia, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.

â€œIn these countries we have suffered huge loss. But we hope the Dishergarh project will be a profit making project ,â€� Ralhan said.

27,Hike in power tariff for farmers,"GANDHINAGAR/VADODARA: The Gujarat government on Tuesday finally acted on the Gujarat Electricity Regulatory Commissionâ€™s recommendations and imposed on farmers a tariff rate which is higher by about 2.5 times than what is prevailing now.

The Gujarat Electricity Board (GEB) increased the tariff from Rs 350 per horse power (HP) to Rs 1,050 per HP for those consuming up to 7.5 HP. Farmers using motors above 7.5 HP will have to pay Rs 1,200 per HP against the Rs 500 they pay now.

The new tariff rate will also invite a 5 per cent electricity duty. â€œThe new bills issued will be effective June 1, 2003,â€� said a senior bureaucrat, requesting anonymity. Minister of state for energy Saurabh Patel had announced three months ago his intention to bring HPbased tariffs â€œsomewhat in line with what the GERC had recommendedâ€� â€” a flat rate of Rs 1,600 per HP.

To offset the GERC award and to keep the tariffs at the low level that had been prevailing for nearly 20-odd years, the state government had to come up with Rs 55 crore in subsidies every month from October 2000. The excuse for not hiking the tariff was the prevailing drought.

With the new tariff rates, the subsidy the government was paying against the lower rate will go down by Rs 20 crore. Simultaneously, it will help the state convince the Asian Development Bank about its willingness to go in for tariff reforms, one of the preconditions for its $350-million energy sector restructuring loan.

So far, the ADB has disbursed only $50 million as the first tranche, while the second tranche awaits approval due to the lack of power reforms. The leaders of Bharatiya Kisan Sangh have opposed the hike in electricity charges for the farm sector and have demanded that the government declare a package as suggested by the Sangh at its their meeting with state energy minister Saurabh Patel.
