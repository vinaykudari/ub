0,One-third of BJP MLAs made ministers,"gandhinagar: twenty-nine new ministers, including ashok bhatt and babubhai bokhiria of cabinet rank, were sworn in at the town hall lawns here on wednesday, taking the total strength of the narendra modi ministry to 39. this is the same strength the unwieldy keshubhai patel ministry had. the ministry has 12 new-comers in the modi ministry now. many of the new faces are virtually unheard of mlas. considering the fact that the bjp has only 116 mlas in the assembly, the strength of the ministry is quite huge, and the pressure from modi's predecessor is written all over the new team. modi has, however, restricted his team to a two-tier ministry, with 11 ministers of cabinet rank and the rest ministers of state. but falling a victim to caste and regional pressures apart from political necessities, modi failed to cut down the size of the ministry as was earlier expected. nor was the ministry-making without hitches. the most surprising entry into the cabinet is that of bokhiria who was a minister of state under keshubhai. ashok bhatt, a brahmin, could not get the cabinet berth so easily then, and was taken in only after immense pressure from the high command at the last moment. bhatt had to resign from the keshubhai ministry last year following framing of charges in a 15-year murder case. however, with co-accused harin pathak being inducted into the vajpayee ministry on monday, bhatt made a public statement in delhi a couple of days ago talking of his re-induction in the cabinet. party sources close to bhatt said he was informed by modi about his entry into the cabinet only 90 minutes before the swearing-in, at noon. apparently, modi had decided to drop bhatt from the list, but bhatt outsmarted him by getting some big-wigs in delhi to exert pressure. the decision to take bhatt was reached in the dead of the night, at about 3.30 a.m. of the 29 new ministers, 17 were in the ministry under keshubhai. twelve have become ministers for the first time. haren pandya, who has been taken in as the senior-most minister of state, was expected by many to get cabinet rank. next in seniority as minister of state is bjp general secretary gordhan zadaphia, a new entrant and perceived as a keshubhai loyalist. nearly 13 ministers who worked under keshubhai failed to make entry into the modi ministry. the main among them are vajubhai vala, jay narayan vyas, jaspal singh (all of them enjoyed cabinet rank), mahendra trivedi, parmanand khattar and ramanlal vora. trivedi, a supporter of liberal leader suresh mehta, failed to return to the ministry because of his rivalry in bhavnagar with state bjp president rajendrasinh rana. jaspal was denied a place in the modi ministry on grounds of indiscipline, while vyas, who had resigned from the earlier ministry after calling keshubhai a 'liar', has been kept out because of opposition from the former cm. those who could make a re-entry despite rumours that they might be dropped included bharat barot and chimanbhai saparia, both strong keshubhai allies, and purshottam solanki, a deputy minister under keshubhai who is accused of involvement in mumbai communal riots in 1992-93. others who made a re-entry are liladhar vaghela, narayanbhai patel, mangubhai patel, prabhatsinh chauhan, bhupendra lakhawala, mulubhai bera, karsanbhai patel, ranjitsinh chavda, hemant chapatwala, harjivanbhai patel and jaswantsinh babhor. the new faces who made it into the ministry are gordhan zadaphia, bavku ugad, devanand solanki, dilip thakore, daulat desai, rajchhod rabari, rajnikant rajwadi, ishwar makwana, vadibhai patel, muhan kundaria, jasumatiben korat and sundarsinh chauhan. there are a dozen obcs in the new modi cabinet, and as many patels.

3,Overstaying journalists have to vacate govt housing,"new delhi: for nearly 70-odd print and photo journalists desperate to cling on to heavily subsidised government houses in the heart of the capital, it is the final nail in the coffin. on october 10, the cabinet committee on accommodation endorsed the union ministry of urban development's move to evict them from government houses which most have been occupying for years, even decades. according to ministry sources, the committee, which is chaired by union human resources development minister murli manohar joshi and has among its members urban development minister ananth kumar and water resources minister arjun sethi, considered the cases of the journalists concerned and turned down their request to be allowed to stay on. entreaties to be allowed to retain their accommodation have, in the last six months, also been made to prime minister atal behari vajpayee, union home minister l k advani and lok sabha speaker g m c balayogi. a delegation even met ananth kumar after stating they wanted to discuss a matter of ``urgent importance'' with him. but he, too, was firm about his ministry's decision. following the committee's decision, notices have been sent to the journalists from the director of estates in the ministry, achala sinha, asking them to vacate their houses by october 15. they have also been told that their request to retain accommodation cannot be acceded to since existing rules do not allow it. with none of them having vacated their accommodation until wednesday, ministry officials said beginning october 16, they would have to pay rent at market rates. this could range between rs 15,000 and rs 60,000 depending on the size and location of the bungalows most of them occupy for rentals amounting to a few hundred rupees. also, the ministry is expected to begin eviction proceedings against them under the public premises (eviction of unauthorised occupants) act, 1971. notices asking these journalists to vacate their government accommodation were first sent during the tenure of ananth kumar's predecessor, jagmohan, in mid-april. the ministry's move was prompted by the fact that not only do most of these 70-odd journalists own houses in delhi from which they collect substantial rent, but also the fact that most take accreditation from the press information bureau after retirement simply to retain their government houses.

4,'We will sweep MCH polls',"hyderabad: the telangana sadhana samiti is poised to convert itself into a political party in ensuing elections to the municipal corporation of hyderabad. according to tss leader a narendra, the samiti, which has decided to jump into the electoral battle, is yet to decide whether fight alone or have seat adjustments with telangana rashtra samiti to avoid split in votes. narendra feels that it is premature to say what shape things would take by the time the notification is issued. he however said that anti-telangana forces would suffer a setback. the telangana factor, he says would play an important role and hence all pro-telangana forces should fight unitedly. if there was no suchunderstanding the possibility of mim and mbt having an edge cannot be ruled out. but this is something the tss leader denies, saying, ""we will sweep the mch polls"". according to tss leaders, an exodus from bjp has already begun and by the time the polls are held, tss would have a powerful cadre, which can eat into the bjp vote bank. the bjp, however, says this is wishful thinking. party spokesman, p prabhakar, the bjp cadre was intact. but the bjp leaders say that some disgruntled elements might think of joining tss if they fail to get party tickets. this however, would not affect the bjp, they say.

15,Naidu likely to hold party post again,"new delhi: pressure is mounting on union rural development minister m venkaiah naidu to return to the party organisation. bjp sources said on thursday that a new post of secretary-general may be created for naidu, a former party spokesperson, something that will make him effectively number two after president jana krishnamurthy. the post would mean more than a traditional general secretary in charge of the organisation, sources said. in any case, even the organisational general secretary in the bjp has always been a key figure in the party, like narendra modi. the bjp leadership is keen to bring naidu back because: one, with elections due in up, punjab, jammu and kashmir and then gujarat, the need is being felt to make the party an effective fighting machine. two, the bjp sorely requires a spokesperson who can speak with some authority. naidu, it is felt, fulfils all these requirements. there was talk of it during the september cabinet reshuffle, as also when george fernandes returned to the cabinet. but naidu had, sources said, made it clear he would not return merely as one of the general secretaries. and, therefore, the post of secretary-general is being thought of. also, the departure of modi for gandhinagar created a vacancy. the first sign that naidu may be returning to the party organisation came on tuesday, when he addressed the party's daily briefing. his task was to do some damage-control after both the opposition and the media slammed the government for fernandes' re-entry.

18,NSUI activists rough up principal,"mumbai: activists of the national students' union of india (nsui) on thursday blackened the face of the acting principal of the watumull institute of technology, worli, over a complaint of alleged ``indecent behaviour'' with female students of the college. a written complaint alleging that principal r.b. kulkarni used ``sexually coloured language, made indecent jokes and had, on more than one occasion, grabbed a female student's waist or tried to hold a girl's hand,'' was submitted to the nsui, the student wing of the congress, last week by the students. ``a similar complaint was filed with mumbai university's students' grievance cell on september 20, but the university failed to take action against mr kulkarni,'' nsui general secretary sadaf aboli told this newspaper. the students, however, have not made any police complaint. on thursday, nsui activists tried to talk to mr kulkarni, but he reportedly refused to speak to them. the activists, supported by some students, then roughed up mr kulkarni and smeared boot polish on his face. mr kulkarni was unavailable for comment. mumbai university vice-chancellor b.l. mungekar confirmed that the university had received a complaint against mr kulkarni. ``we will look into the matter on a priority basis,'' he said. asked why the university had failed to take action so far, he said, ``there are procedures that have to be followed in complaints of such a nature. a complaint regarding sexual abuse is an extremely serious matter.'' according to the students of watumull college, mr kulkarni's behaviour made them very uncomfortable. ``he cracks indecent jokes in the classroom and also comments on the physical appearance of girls,'' alleged a student. the students have alleged that ``during the college picnic on september 8 at lohgadh near lonavla, mr kulkarni grabbed one of the girls by her waist while she was alone and made sexual comments''. the student told this newspaper that ``i have been feeling very uncomfortable in his presence after the incident at the picnic''. in another incident, a female student who was unable to attend the picnic because of a urinary infection, was embarrassed by mr kulkarni when he allegedly announced her ailment to the whole class. ``on one occasion we asked him to stop such indecent behaviour, but he told us that we were misinterpreting his fatherly affection,'' a student said. the students approached nsui only after university officials failed to initiate an inquiry into the matter despite the complaint. nsui has alleged that in the past when complaints were lodged with the grievance cell, the accused would often go scot-free and the complainant would be victimised. ``similar complaints of alleged sexual abuse in a college in vashi and byculla are also pending with the grievance cell. why is the cell not inquiring into the complaints,'' an activist asked.

20,Dandiya resumes amid political music,"mumbai: the clack of dandiya wands resumed in some parts of the city on thursday after an unprecedented day on which almost all major navratri mandals switched off the festive lights protesting against the 10 p.m. deadline set by the state government. while some big-time organisers like sankalp in goregaon continued with their blackout on thursday, they promised to resume the celebrations from friday owing to ``tremendous public pressure''. ``we have decided to resume simply because of public pressure. we even opened a counter for refund of garba passes, but everybody wanted to hit the dance floor,'' says devendra joshi of sankalp. singer falguni pathak, who is closely associated with the organisation, was mobbed by about 500-700 enthusiasts on thursday who wanted her to belt out dandiya numbers. for navratri mandals, the decision on whether to resume or not was taken after long hours of confusion, weighing of odds and political posturing. but finally, the people's mandate to have fun prevailed, and as large crowds of mainly young people gathered around dandiya rinks in the city dissenting navratri organisers switched on the festive lights, albeit grudgingly. organisers said they would adhere to the 10 p.m. deadline. they said even priests advised them to continue with the festivities as rituals like sthapna and aarti had already been carried out. although mandals like the millennium club, juhu, started celebrations on thursday, organisers in wadala, ghatkopar and nirmal nagar cancelled festivities for the second day. meanwhile, political activity over the issue raged backstage, with deputy chief minister chhagan bhujbal holding the centre responsible for the impasse. ``if the bjp-led government at the centre wants it can solve this problem within four hours. all it needs to do is amend the environment protection act. i don't know why it is not doing that,'' he said. as many as six mps of the bjp-sena alliance__ram naik, jaywantiben mehta, pramod mahajan, manohar joshi, ved prakash goyal and suresh prabhu__were from mumbai and still the centre was not doing anything to amend the law, he said. according to him, the 10 p.m. deadline for using loudspeakers was posing a problem for navratri organisers now and it could create problem for other festivals, film star nites and fashion shows in the future. mr bhujbal said the df government could not be blamed for the present situation. ``under the bombay police act, i have powers to extend the performing licence up to midnight. i am willing to help out. but the central law has placed severe constraints. certain bjp mlas are trying to politicise the issue in the city in view of the ensuing bmc elections,'' he said. mukesh gandhi, president of the navratri mahasangh, said the reprieve letter that some of the bjp mlas got from dilip biswas, chairperson of the central pollution control board, did not clearly mention that the state had the power to extend the loudspeaker deadline. however, bjp mla atul shah, who is also the spokesperson for the navratri utsav mahamandal, said the state government was not gracious enough despite getting the reprieve from mr biswas. the letter states, ``in view of the special circumstances during navratri, ram leela and other festivals, concerned state authorities may exercise the provisions of this rule in order to allow loudspeakers beyond 10 p.m. on a case-to-case basis.'' mr shah said efforts were on to get the act amended at the central level. ``however, time is too short. if not this year, then our fight for next year has already begun,'' he said. and on the positive side, said mr gandhi, ``now, navrartri utsav will be revived in its traditional spirit. commercialisation will be done away with as everybody will call back the dholwalas, and festivities will go on without loudspeakers.'' he said he was instructing organisers not to cancel shows and disappoint the public, but to modify their celebrations.

21,NCP critical of govt largesse to Ghai,"mumbai: the nationalist congress party (ncp) feels film-maker subhash ghai's pet project has been let off without a political screen test. party sources say the government has cleared all logjams for mr ghai's proposed film, tv and media arts institute and granted 20 acres of prime land near film city in goregaon for the project without the state cabinet's approval. at a time when the treasury rings hollow, this amounts to an unwarranted dole, they grudge. ``the speed at which this project was approved without the cabinet being consulted reeks of murkiness and preferential treatment. it is bound to raise several uncomfortable questions,'' said an ncp source. the institute, with an initial investment of about rs 30 crore, will be managed by whistling woods international, a hundred per cent subsidiary and an independent company of mr ghai's mukta arts. ``why should there be controversy over a project which has been cleared by the ministry of culture and which promises to generate a new pool of talent for indian cinema?'' countered mr ghai. out of the 20 acres that have been allotted, 15 acres are for the institute and five acres to build a hostel. mr ghai said that the institute would be helpful in more ways than one. ``mumbai does not have an institution of this kind. it will be affiliated to film schools and universities in the u.s., u.k. and australia and techniques like screenplay writing, direction, sound, music and cinematography will be taught,'' he said, adding that the advisory board of the institute would include prominent film and media personalities such as dilip kumar, shyam benegal, shah rukh khan, a.r. rehman and shiamak davar. elaborate library and archive facilities have also been planned as part of the institute.
