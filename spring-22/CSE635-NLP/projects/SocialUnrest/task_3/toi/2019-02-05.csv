0,"Proposed parking plaza violates law, says lawyer","pune: lawyer n p bhog who has taken up many issues of infringements in the cantonment, alleges that the parking plaza slated to come up on east and coyaji streets in the cantonment, will not only be ineffective, but also illegal. ""it is to be built on an existing road which is a public amenity joining two roads and therefore has zero fsi (floor space index). second, no suggestions or objections concerning the project have been invited from the public as required under the law. third, the structure will violate building and existing fsi rules of the area,"" he says. since the land on which the plaza is to come up is technically 'army area', it enjoys an fsi of only 0.5, with permission to build upto only two floors (that is, ground plus two). ""even in the 'civil areas' of the cantonment (which were originally created to cater to army needs), the fsi is only 1, with permission to build on ground plus two. clearly a 5-floor structure is illegal,"" says bhog. the site, off east street, falls in the army area. pcb officials counter this by displaying a 7/12 land record extract showing survey no. 264 (the location of the proposed car park) as land of which the pcb is the ""landlord, manager, and holder of occupancy rights"". the document, however, is dated only three months back: october 25, 2001. ""we wish to know who the earlier holder of the land was, and whether the records have been manipulated,"" bhog says. pressure to extend the cantonment's notified civil areas (with their more favourable fsi and building rules) into army areas, is strong in pune. one prominent builder even made a public presentation suggesting that the army move away! the army intermittently shoots down such proposals, especially in view of the threat to the security of its supply depot and other establishments. cantonment board chief j.s. mahi says he has put together a suggestion outlining three different sets of fsi in the cantonment - for residential, semi-residential and commercial areas. environmentalists however point to the harm already done: ""army areas east of east street and those off moledina road, are flooded with civilian traffic and cars because of main street's illegalities,"" bhog comments. ""the illegitimate baby of main street is being dumped at the door of the army.""

4,"Knee, hip replacement cost a one time investment","lucknow:""medicine, like any other branch of science, is ever changing and practice of medicine is a lifelong education for the practitioner"", says dr rb mishra, chief medical superintendent, balrampur hospital. he was referring to the operating theatre for total hip and knee replacement which will soon be opened at hospital, for the first time in lucknow's history. quoting the example of the prime minister's successful knee replacement operation, dr mishra termed it as a major feat of promotion. ""not many people were hitherto aware of this boon, which is possible. but now with the life expectancy increasing, people have become knowledgeable and are forthcoming,"" he said. the painless operation will cost a whooping rs 65000, but will be a onetime investment. a team of 14 doctors with the technical know-how are undergoing training for the job. ""although there will be 14 doctors, the sensitive operation will be attended by only four of the authorised ones,"" dr mishra said. the technically demanding operation is carried out after appropriate planning. the size and position of the bone, and prevention of any kind of infection after the operation, is taken into account. special care is taken for patients suffering from allergies and skin diseases as they are highly vulnerable to infections. time for physiotherapy or exercises to strengthen muscles is determined keeping in mind the condition of each patient. two days after the operation, the patient is made to stand. the next day, he is asked to move with the help of a stick. after a good response from the patient, he is discharged from the hospital. however, it takes nearly two to three months for the patient to feel absolutely normal. customarily, the operation for total knee replacement, for both the legs, is performed one at a time. but it was a factor of stake for dr pushpalata chandra, senior consultant of the hospital, to undergo operation for both her knees together, at aiims, new delhi. laughing at her fortitude she said: ""it was just a matter of time for me. i cannot afford to stay in hospital for months after the surgery, while my patients are suffering without me!"" dr rajesh malhotra, aiims, new delhi, said that even for elbows, shoulders and fingers, replacement was possible. ""but these replacements have not given as positive results as total hip and knee replacements have,"" he added. for the wrist and ankle replacement, the technique is at experimental stage. while there is no age limit for this benefit, doctors prefer it as early as possible.

7,50 villages languish for lack of development,"allahabad: no development funds for over 50 villages of city west, no electrification of several villages, no harijan colonies, no widow pension . . . the list of `nos' can be never-ending if a clear picture of the state of affairs is to be painted. uprooted electricity poles and snapped electricity cables in several villages including bisauna, karenda and its adjoining areas are a glaring example of the official apathy towards the constituency - the domain of apna dal state president and sitting mla atiq ahmed who had polled a phenomenal 73,152 votes as a samajwadi party candidate in the 1996 assembly elections which was far more than the total of votes polled by javed iqbal of bsp (21,005) and teerath ram kohli bjp (38,053). whatever little development work was initiated in the constituency still remains incomplete by and large. school buildings with out ceilings and boundaries, girt and stones scattered on roads which were meant to be metalled, partly converted into link roads, incomplete, work for sinking handpumps and tubewells remain a mute testimony to the fact that `vikas karya' (development work) was embarked upon in the constituency, ostensibly to fool the gullible voters. says the sitting mla atiq ahmed: ""funds meant for the constituency were not sanctioned on time. even installments of the jawa har rozgar yojna were not released and the government had apparently preferred to turn a blind eye towards several reminders and letters sent to the government from time to time."" still, as serts the mla: ""lot of developmental work has been undertaken at my initiative."" he also feels that a riot and communal tension free tenure is again a major achievement for him. ditto the gram pradhans of bisauna, shahid pradhan, madaripur bhunwar singh and vasudev from village phulwa. the trio are critical of the government apathy towards the villages and term it as a contrived attempt to tarnish the image of the sitting mla who did not belong to the ruling bhartiya janata party (bjp). ""going by the high rate of illiteracy in the area, facilities for education too remain a distant dream for the electorate here,"" rues savitri devi of village lakhanpur who herself is `kaksha das pass' (passed class 10) but is unable to send her children to school for proper education as the paltry earning of her peon husband is not enough to make two ends meet. says the sp candidate from city west gopal das yadav: ""the people of the constituency are clamouring for a respite from the oppressive raj of the sitting mla."" he states that the elector ate has now started asking as to what development mr ahmed has initiated in his 12 year tenure. ""even the yadav-muslim vote bank of mr ahmed has pledged support for the samajwadi party this time,"" he claims, adding: ""let the masses themselves analyse the work done by me in just five years of my tenure and compare it with the present situation."" meanwhile, the firebrand bjp candidate, laxmi shankar ojha has pledged to uproot the criminal elements from the constituency. he has openly termed mr ahmed as an isi agent and a traitor and alleged that development in the area took a backseat during his tenure. ""the mla does not want that education be given impor tance in his constituency for obvious reasons,"" he alleges. be as it may, the issues of development and related things are likely to take a backseat as the date of polls draws nigh and the only factor which till date has played an important role -caste factor, will be the decisive component for election of the peoples' representative, observers feel.

9,DM urges govt to fix norms in regularisation,"allahabad: the controversy regarding the process of regularisation of government press daily wage employees against vacant posts, has taken a new twist with the intervention of the district magistrate. he is learnt to have written to the industrial development secretary for fixing norms at an early date to avoid tension between the employees and the authorities. at the end of his two-page suggestion, the dm also sought proper guidance in the matter. the letter has also briefed the secretary about the stands of both parties. the dm has urged the secretary to take an early decision and formulate a firm policy which the director of the government press would be obliged to implement. he also suggested that senior government officials could even hold meetings with the parties here in allahabad or at lucknow for finding an amicable solution to minimise the tense situation. mr chaturvedi wrote that due to the dispute often the district administration and the police were forced to intervene. the continuous dharna / agitation by the employees also gives rise to a law and order problem and a few untoward incidents did occur. it was after those incidents that he called the director and the employees for talks. one reason for the tension was that even after interview for 30 posts, results were not declared. the director claimed that since the representative of backward category was not present, the interview was postponed. the dm thought that since it was quite a sensitive issue, the press authorities should have shown more seriousness. the director could have deputed some other person. the dm has asked the director to declare the results soon. the main point of dispute, however, was the regularisation of 180 employees. the employee leaders said that there were indeed 180 vacant posts and the director was not willing to fill them, it was alleged. on the contrary, the director said the posts were not new and that the posts of coolies were changed into labour class posts as such these were not extra posts and the process of coolies being appointed to these pots was going on. the employee leaders were also demanding appointments on vacant technical posts.

18,Employees declare war on Kerala govt,"thiruvananthapuram: the bugle for battle between the kerala government and its employees has been blown. for the first time in the history of the state, employees cutting across party loyalties have announced indefinite strike from wednesday to protest slashing some of their perquisites as part of the austerity measures. earlier, a three-hour-long discussion between the unions leaders and the government, failed to break the deadlock. the employees wanted the austerity measures held in abeyance and the government expressed its inability to do so. the employees'' unions branded the antony government ""insensitive"", while the chief minister termed the strike plan a ""war on the three crore people of kerala"". antony told the media in the evening that he regretted the adamant attitude of the unions which refused to realise the gravity of the situation and wanted only their interests safeguarded. the government came out with a 16-page pamphlet detailing the financial crisis and the need for cooperation from the employees. it blamed the erstwhile left front government''s reckless financial management that brought the state on the brink of bankruptcy. ""i told them (union leaders) that the govenment was willing to open a dialogue with them on all issues once the financial situation improved. but they were unwilling to consider anything other than withdrawing the austerity measures"", antony said.

25,Postponement of VAT scheme implementation disappoints govt,"gandhinagar: the gujarat government is perturbed with the recent central government decision of postponing the replacement of sales tax as the main source of income of all states with a more ""viable"" and ""rational"" value-added tax (vat) regime by one more year. ""we have prepared the framework for implementing vat and readied the draft gujarat value added tax bill. it will be placed in the budget session of the state assembly which starts on february 23. but lack of preparedness of other states is coming in the way of the state going ahead with vat,"" said state finance minister nitin patel. officials believe that despite the central government's decision of postponing implementation vat, gujarat could well go ahead with it in case the three neighbouring states - maharashtra, madhya pradesh and rajasthan - show some willingness. ""unfortunately, the three states are considerably less prepared than gujarat for the changeover. this one reason why we cannot implement vat despite our preparedness, first by preparing an expert report on it and then by coming up with a draft law,"" a top bureaucrat said. nitin said, ""we had told the centre that we were so ready to change over to vat that we just needed a nod from other states for implementing it. training of officials and computerisation process is on. people in trade and commerce will now be taken up for training in preparation of implementing vat. we will also make necessary legal changes in other laws, including simplifying sales tax, to bring it closer to vat rules that we have prepared. when it is implemented from 2003, gujarat's preparedness would be the best."" the draft law, prepared in january 2002, defines vat as a ""tax on the sale of any goods or commodity at every point in the series of sales made by the registered dealer with the provisions of credits of input tax paid at the previous points of purchase thereof."" said a bureaucrat, ""one cannot rule out the possibility of placing the bill in the coming assembly session, though the notification implementing it will be out only when the neighbouring states are ready for vat."" despite vat not being implemented in the state, officials do not rule the possibility of certain groundwork towards it even in the coming budget, 2002-03. ""the legal framework is ready,"" said a well-placed source. ""we have asked people for their opinion on vat. as it is not possible to shift overnight from sales tax to vat, we may introduce some steps in the budget."" the steps to be taken might include reduction of the sales tax slabs and expanding the categories that already exist, officials said. the vat draft bill might become the basis for ""rationalising"" the current sales tax. two ""output tax"" rates are being sought to be introduced - of 1 per cent and another of 4 per cent. then, there will be a ""lumpsum tax"" to be charged on certain commodities. ""we may move towards a similar direction in the coming budget,"" said a bureaucrat. the vat draft bill seeks to exempt certain categories from taxation. these are - dealers whose turnover is below rs 50,000 per year; farmers who sell agricultural produce grown by then on their land; charitable, religious or educational institutes ""carrying on activity of manufacturing, buying, selling or supplying goods, in performance of its functions for achieving its avowed objects""; and fishermen who sell ""exclusively fish or any sea food"" caught by them or members of their family. the draft bill introduces the regime of ""input tax credit"" which the registered dealer would be entitled to. it would be the ""amount of tax paid or payable by the registered dealer, who has purchased the taxable goods to the seller,"" and would be based on ""the turnover of purchases made by the purchasing dealer during the tax period."" to implement vat, a commissioner of commercial tax is sought to be introduced, who would replace the current sales tax commissioner.

27,3 ministers advocate astrological studies,"gandhinagar: creating a fresh controversy, at least three cabinet ministers have sought to give a 'scientific' credence to astrology and even made certain sneaking references on the need to introduce it in the education system, too. cabinet spokesperson purshottam rupala, social justice and empowerment minister fakirbhai vaghela and energy minister kaushik patel, asserted at the three-day seminar here that astrology is a 'science' and part of the 'bharatiya sanskriti'. the seminar ended on monday. the seminar, organised jointly by the all-india astrologers' federation and the all-gujarat astrological society, saw the three ministers insist on three days that astrology was one of the 'most important aspects of our cultural heritage'. kaushik told the national astrology seminar that it was 'necessary to ensure that the shastras that speak of astrology be researched properly'. fakirbhai said, the 'science' be made useful for daily use. and rupala added, 'it is necessary to take the science to the people'. rupala said, ""it was unfortunate that certain elements have sought to misuse the great science to their personal advantage. this is one reason why its importance has been going down. hence, there is a particular need to take the science to the people"". significantly, the three senior ministers' statements stand in sharp contrast to the view expressed by education minister anandi patel, who had opposed its introduction in school curriculum last year when union human resources minister murli manohar joshi created a controversy by insisting it be part of education. ashok bhatt, who re-entered as health minister under the modi government, was the only senior bjp leader who had said that astrology be part of the curriculum and be linked with the ancient knowledge on health. while then chief minister keshubhai patel remained non-committal, modi's view, too, is still not known.
