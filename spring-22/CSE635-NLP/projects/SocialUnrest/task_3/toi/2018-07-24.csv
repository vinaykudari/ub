1,Number of poor in city to rise as govt widens scope,"new delhi: the number of poor in delhi are likely to go up as the city government widens the scope of determining urban poverty. along with the city slum dwellers who qualify as below poverty line, the government is planning to include migrant labourers and other categories of daily wagers in its poverty list. these people, who do not have permanent residence but are poor by low income standards, will now be included in the bpl category and could benefit from the government-run poverty alleviation programmes. the government would soon be inviting income declarations from them for issuing bpl certificates. officials claim that once the survey is completed, the poverty estimates are likely to go up to 20 per cent of the total city population. interestingly, the city government's estimates would be challenging the latest poverty ratio estimated by the planning commission. these figures indicate that the poverty ratio in delhi has fallen to eight per cent as compared to 14.69 per cent in 1993-94. however, the city government has been asserting that these projections are grossly underestimated and the bpl population in delhi is between 18 to 20 per cent of the total population. according to a food and supplies official, the government would be seeking help from voluntary sector organisations to reach out to migrant labourers and daily wagers. ``the voluntary organisations working in the field would be able to spread information and mobilise people to apply for the bpl card,'' an official said. the food and supplies department would also advertise in newspapers inviting income declarations from these sections. following the poverty estimates undertaken by the planning commission, the department is conducting its own study of bpl to implement its populist schemes of targeted public distribution scheme and antyodya anna yojna. through these schemes the government distributes highly subsidised grain to the the bpl and poorest of the poor. the tpds scheme has already been implemented and ration is being distributed to 4.11 lakh jhuggi ration card holders. according to a senior official, the government has already identified families living in jj clusters which earn less than rs 24,000 per annum as bpl. as each family that holds a jrc has at least 5 members, the bpl figure has already gone up to 20 lakh. officials claim that once the entire identification process is completed, the bpl figure is likely to rise even further. the parameters set by the 50th sample survey and the d t lakdawala committee, which are followed by the planning commission, have suggested the average of weighted commodity indices of the consumer price index as the basic methodology for determining urban poverty in delhi. however, officials say the city government is reviewing the bpl list on the basis of non-economic parameters provided by the ministry of urban affairs. these parameters follow the asset criteria which takes into account the type of housing, water supply and ownership of consumer durable. officials point out that as delhi's per capita income at current prices is much higher than the national average, the city government has already modified the income limit for qualification for paps. delhi's per capita income is rs 29,623, as compared to the national average of rs 15,841. for certain schemes like scholarship to scs/sts, the income slab is as high as rs 48,000 per annum as compared to rs 36,000 income slab followed in the rest of the country.

4,Vajpayee rules out compromise on terrorism,"new delhi: prime minister atal behari vajpayee on tuesday ruled out compromising on india's ""basic principles"" while negotiating with pakistan, but said the delhi-islamabad engagement would continue. related stories making a statement on the agra summit in both houses of parliament, vajpayee put cross-border terrorism at centre-stage. he hinted that india could be as adamant on this issue as pakistan was on the 'centrality' of kashmir in future negotiations. ""obviously, india's concerns in vital areas -- such as cross border terrorism -- will have to find place in any document that future negotiations endeavour to conclude."" vajpayee's statement will be followed later in the day with a full debate in the lok sabha on the summit. the prime minister confirmed that he and external affairs minister jaswant singh had accepted invitations to visit islamabad to carry the dialogue forward. india was not looking for debating points, he said. ""we will engage in quiet, serious diplomacy,"" he said. vajpayee said the quest for a joint document was abandoned in agra mainly on pakistan's insistence on the ""settlement"" of the jammu and kashmir issue as a precondition for the normalisation of relations. pakistan was also reluctant to ackowledge and address cross-border terrorism, he said. ""my cabinet colleagues and i were unanimously of the view that our basic principles cannot be sacrificed for the sake of a joint document."" he said no worthwhile purpose could be served by a debate on whether or not jammu and kashmir was a core issue. but india could not ignore the ""fact of terrorism and violence in the state, which is exported from across the borders"". it could not accept that the insurgency in the state, assisted from abroad, was anything but terrorism. countering pakistani president pervez musharraf's remarks, he said: ""the daily killing of innocent men, women and children can simply not be glorified as jehad or as any kind of political movement."" he mentioned recent killings on the amarnath yatra route and the massacre in the jammu region. pakistan's refusal to end cross-border terrorism was the ""main hurdle in the creation of a conducive atmosphere"", he said. the statement did not offer a blow-by-blow account of why the summit collapsed, but vajpayee insisted that ""we did achieve a degree of understanding"". india will continue to seek dialogue and reconciliation, he said. vajpayee listed the other issues he had raised with musharraf: the release of 54 indian prisoners of war, extradition of known criminals and terrorists given ""sanctuary"" in pakistan, the upkeep of sikh gurudwaras and hindu temples in that country, the treatment of pilgrims visiting from india, and increasing bilateral trade. he said he focused on terrorism in the state. ""i conveyed in clear terms that india has the resolve, strength and stamina to counter terrorism and violence until it is decisively crushed,"" he said. ""i want to reiterate this determination today on the floor of this house.""

5,Don't be apologetic about summit: PM to partymen,"new delhi: prime minister atal bihari vajpayee on tuesday said bjp mps need not be apologetic about the indo-pakistan agra summit as it has been made clear to pakistan that if they regard kashmir as the core issue, then ""the core of the core issue is pakistan's occupation of kashmir since 1947."" briefing reporters on the hour long bjp parliamentary party meeting, spokesman v k malhotra said vajpayee who briefed the members on the agra summit said india was prepared to discuss the kashmir issue dating back to 1948 when pakistan had occupied a portion of it. the prime minister spoke briefly as he was to make a detailed statement on the summit in both houses of parliament. he said the issue of prisoners of war (pow) too was raised during his meeting with pakistan president gen pervez musharraf. many families had wanted the issue to be raised during the summit as they felt that their members had been in pakistan prisons for more than 30 years, party sources said. members raised killing of amarnath pilgrims and the doda incident where terrorists had kidnapped and killed some villagers. home minister l k advani assured members that all steps would be taken including the setting up of more check posts and that these killings by militants only showed ""they were frustrated"". he said terrorists had come disguised as sadhus and killed innocent pilgrims. parliamentary affairs minister pramod mahajan informed members of the business for current week including discussion on agra summit and the uti fiasco.

6,Oppn flays govt over 'failure' of summit,"new delhi: did the government approach the agra summit as amateurs or would atal behari vajpayee be remembered as a prime minister who refused to compromise? lok sabha began debating this on tuesday. madav rao scindia, deputy leader of the opposition in the lok sabha, said the summit had ended up being a setback to indo-pakistan relations. ``agra has pushed us back, not forward.'' he said the congress supported any government initiative on peace with pakistan. but when vajpayee goes to islamabad for the return visit, scindia, said he should go prepared. he accused the foreign office of being ``amateurish'' when it came to preparing for the summit. the congress leaders also criticised the government for agreeing to go in for the summit without a structured agenda -- just as pakistan wanted it. he said the government's ``strange'' handling of the summit had fuelled all kinds of speculation. pakistan managed to get its point of view across through the media, while india kept mum. scindia said if vajpayee goes to islamabad on his return visit, he should not be media-shy but articulate india's point of view. ``mr prime minister, this unilateral chastity will not do,'' scindia said, hinting that pakistan would not remain reticent before the media. four hours before the lok sabha debate began, the prime minister had made a statement in both houses, stressing that india will not compromise on the issue of cross-border terrorism. and any document which emerges out of future india-pakistan negotiations will have to reflect that. at the end of the debate, vajpayee is expected to make another statement -- replying to issues raised during the discussion. bharatiya janata party's vijay kumar malhotra opened for the government. he rediculed the congress for trying to ``teach'' the vajpayee government how summits should be conducted. he reminded that a congress government released close to a lakh pakistani prisoners after the 1971 war without securing the freedom of 54 of india's own men in pakistani jails. earlier, samajwadi party leader mulayam singh yadav had made a similar point. yadav also said that after winning a war india always seemed to lose at the negotiating table. its boundaries always shrunk, he said, refering to agreements in which captured territory was handed back. in a back-handed compliment, malhotra said yadav was speaking the same language as the old jan sangh. the bjp mp said musharraf had broken many protocols during his visit, and had been handled well by vajpayee. ``he is the first prime minister in 50 years who did not sign an agreement on pakistani terms, who sent musharraf back empty handed.'' he criticised the oppoosition of making an issue on the government's decision to talk to musharraf though pakistan had not agreed to a structured agenda. he said the government had informed opposition leaders at the all-party meeting ahead of the summit that pakistan had not agreed to an agenda. ``then nobody said don't talk to him.''

8,3-member panel to probe UTI's investment decision,"new delhi: the government said on tuesday, a three-member committee will enquire into the investment decisions of unit trust of india (uti), and justified the lower dividends paid by the country's largest mutual fund on account of falling interest rates and market indices. finance minister yashwant sinha told the rajya sabha that the us-64 scheme, which offered dividends of 13.5 per cent in 1998-99 and 13.75 per cent in 1999-2000, offered only 10 per cent dividend in 2000-01. ``there has been a near decline in the interest rates in the last few years. the stock market indices have also declined and experienced volatility. the returns on capital market instruments have fallen over the last few years,'' he said. ``further, the deepak parekh committee had observed that the dividend policy for us-64 should be in line with market related returns from instruments of comparable risk and maturity,'' sinha added. minister of state for finance gingee n ramachandran, said uti's monthly income plan (mip) schemes have provided better returns to investors compared to similar instruments despite decline in interest rates in the post liberalisation era. ``the rate of dividend under some of the mips have been reduced. although current rates may appear `less than market' rate when looked at in isolation, over a full tenure of seven years, mip 95 (i) has been given a payout of 12.47 per cent per annum on a post-tax basis, which is above market return for this type of product,'' he said. similarly, mip 96 (iv) has paid out 13.14 per cent over its full tenure of five years, more than market rate, he added. mip 1995 (i) and mip 1996 (i) have distributed five per cent dividend last fiscal.

13,Retired KSRTC staffers to lay siege to minister's house,"bellary: bellary district unit ksrtc retired employees' union has planned a siege on the residence of karnataka transport minister c.r. sageer ahmed in bangalore on thursday. members of the association who had been fighting injustice meted out by the government have now decided to intensify their movement. d.h. krishnamurthy, working president and h. gresham, general secretary of the association, which is also affiliated to the bangalore federation, blamed the government for its delay tactics and lethargic attitude, keeping the demands of retired employees in abeyance. gresham said even as the minister is boasting about the improved economic condition of the corporations and profit trend, the management is backing out of paying ex-gratia to its retired employees. he pointed out that when an employee joins the corporation and serves it for a minimum of 240 days in the first year of joining, gratuity must be calculated from the first year. but the corporation was adamant and was considering gratuity period from the date of absorption of the employee. this having been delayed by 4-5 years had ultimately reduced the gratuity amount. gresham said the corporation has sanctioned free passes to employees who retired after 1988. he said those who retired before 1988 are deprived this facility and neither have the unions taken up the issue of discrimination. gresham pointed out that the chief minister had recently announced the free pass scheme for about 1.5 lakh disabled persons apart from freedom fighters, legislators, members of parliament and legislative council members, but deprived retired employees of the corporation, who account for a mere 3,000 to 4,000. gresham vented criticism on the working of unions connected with the regional transport corporations and pointed out that the two groups are only meant to garner paper publicity and not to bring justice to the aggrieved. union leaders are engaged in publicity drives and mudslinging, instead of uniting to bring about solidarity and justice, he charged. retired staffers have also to face discrimination in the form of interest paid on provident fund deposits which has now been fixed at 10 per cent for employees. we demand the same benefits, he stated. to settle these issues, the retired employees have decided to reach bangalore and besiege sageer ahmed.

19,"45 vehicles burnt, hundreds hurt in Peenya riot","bangalore: at least 45 vehicles were burnt down, 400 damaged and hundreds of people injured when employees at the peenya industrial estate launched a wildcat strike on tuesday morning. the police fired tear gas shells and resorted to lathicharge for nearly six hours to defuse the tension. the drama began around 10 am when the 10,000-plus employees at the peenya industrial estate staged a rasta roko following a rumour that provident fund claims would be honoured only after employees turn 45. they then wanted to proceed to vidhana soudha. ``when they were denied permission to go to vidhana soudha, things got worse and the protesters refused to relent. clarifications and assurances given by the police and officials of the employees' provident fund organisation went unheeded,'' joint commissioner of police b.n. nagaraj said. as rumours led to rioting, the busy national highway was chock-a-block with vehicles piled up for miles from yeshwantpur circle up to nelamangala. property worth crores of rupees was damaged and 23 police personnel, including acp (malleswaram) v. thimmappa, sustained injuries in a clash that erupted when they attempted to disperse the mob. about 100 persons have been arrested. trucks, ksrtc, bmtc buses and brand-new vehicles which were truck-loaded to the city from the factories -- 45 in all -- were set ablaze, leaving thousands of commuters in the lurch. most of them, including many children, were seen crying, left with no option but to hide behind shops located at a distance from the circle. all business houses shut shop and the police were seen pulling out people hiding in the shops. the worst hit were schoolchildren and office-goers, who while returning home, were chased by the police. police commissioner t. madiyal said prohibitory orders have been clamped in rajagopalanagar, rmc yard and the peenya police station limits till 8 am on friday. nine platoons of the police, hoysala vans and fire engines have also been stationed. peenya industries association president b. chandrahasa shetty said: ``the employees indulged in criminal activities without any provocation.'' the office of the employees' provident fund organisation was also attacked. ``however, the mob in this area was calmed down by our clarifications,'' said regional provident fund commissioner, karnataka, n.a. nair.

23,Bihar govt to set up bomb disposal squads in 15 districts,"patna: keeping in view the stepped up activities of the extremist outfits and isi in different parts of the state, the bihar government has decided to set up bomb disposal squads in 15 districts. the squads would diffuse the bombs before they are used by the extremists. though there has been no instance of isi-engineered bombs blasts in bihar, the use of bombs and land mines by extremists is quite common. the bihar government is concerned about the blasts, masterminded by the isi, in other parts of the country and it does not want to take any chance in this regard. it is more alert after the arrest of hardcore isi men in sitamarhi and other districts bordering nepal. the state government had set up a bomb disposal squad under the special branch of the police headquarters after the series of bomb blasts in bombay and calcutta, but that proved inadequate to deal with the task of diffusing bombs in different districts of the state. subsequently, the government felt it tactically prudent that each district must have its own bomb disposal squad which could quickly react to the situation in the event of detection of bombs. the government has spared a sum of rs 43.3 lakh to open up 15 such squads at the range and zonal police headquarters level. the money, earmarked for the purpose, would be mainly spent on purchase of equipment such as blasting machine, electronics stethoscope, gas guns, chemical kit for detection of explosives, wire and cable locator, water cannon, prodder, mobile bomb, sealed rsp tool kit and zoom binoculars. but the very purpose of the state government to equip the police force with latest gadgets and tackle unforeseen situations, specially those of diffusing the live bombs, is being defeated as police personnel, specially in the constabulary and asi, si ranks are not inclined to join the bomb disposal squad. a senior police officer said that when police personnel were sent to undergo training of diffusing live bombs in different police training institutes in the country, including manesar (haryana), the trainees `deliberately fared poor in the test' so that they are not considered for inclusion in the squad. he said the police headquarters now has decided to take a tough stand so that the `erring' officers might not get away easily and posting of police personnel to the squad is ensured.
