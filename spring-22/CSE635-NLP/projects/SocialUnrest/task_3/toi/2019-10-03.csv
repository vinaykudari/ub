1,Trinamul protests power tariff hike,"KOLKATA: Trinamul Congress on Wednesday staged a protest rally in front of the private power utility CESC Ltd Headquarters against its abnormal tariff hike and new power connection procedure for Durga Puja pandals.

Led by the the Trinamul Youth Congress President Sanjoy Bakshi, a delegation also submitted a memorandum to the CESC Managing Director Sanjeev Goenka urging him to revert the rates of power tariff as were approved last by the State Electricity Regulatory Commission till the apex court pronounced its final verdict in the case pending before it.

The delegation also urged Goenka to liberalise the procedure for power connection to the Durga Puja pandals.

Opposition TC Legislature Party leader Pankaj Banerjee alleged that instead of taking action against the CESC for its abnormal power tariff hike, the ruling Left Front had shown an indifferent attitude towards the issue.

He also regretted that apart from abnormal power tariff hike, the CESC was also sending ''confusing bills'' to its subscribers.

A number of TC MLAs including Sougata Roy, Tapas Roy, Partha Chatterjee and Paras Dutta were also present on the occasion.

Later, a procession was also organised in protest against railway bifurcation and abnormal power tariff hike by the CESC.

2,Labour leader slams economic policies of govt,"PUNE: Launching a scathing attack on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government at the Centre, Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS) founder president Dattopant Thengdi on Wednesday warned the BJP of a major electoral debacle in case it continued with its â€œanti-poor reformsâ€� under pressure from Western countries. The senior ideologue of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) predicted â€œroughâ€� days ahead for the BJP while criticising the economic policies of the government at a joint rally of the BMS, Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS) and Swadeshi Jagran Manch (SJM).

Thengdi said the government should stop â€œbucklingâ€� under pressure from the World Trade Organisation (WTO). The octogenarian said the government should, at least, think about the future of the BJP before pushing ahead with the current set of â€œlop-sided economic policiesâ€� propagated by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. â€œThe government should not forget that it has to face elections sooner or later. And the voters are very much from India, not Europe or the United States,â€� he said.

Criticising the disinvestment policy of the government, the BMS leader said it was ironic that decision-makers â€œhived offâ€� all profit-making public sector units (PSUs) at â€œthrowawayâ€� prices while those in losses remain in possession. He also took a dig at the new labour policy on grounds that it gave employers a blanket permission to go ahead with retrenchment, lay-offs and closure.

â€œAll factories, independent of the number of workers, should be covered by benefits of the Industrial Disputes Act,â€� he said.

Highly critical of the â€œskewedâ€� agriculture policy being followed by the government, Thengdi strongly advocated continuance of subsidy to enable domestic farmers get their dues and face competition from foreign agri-producers. â€œIt is unfortunate that Indian farmers get a measly subsidy of $66 as compared to the hefty sum of $21,000 and $17,000 given by the US and Europe to its peasants annually,â€� he said. To make matters worse, the government has practically withdrawn all quantitative restrictions on foreign goods and brought down the import duty to negligible levels, he alleged.

The rally was also addressed by BMS general secretary Sharad Joshi, SJM convenor Arun Walimbe and BKS general secretary Dayanand Hurdale.

3,Stamp scam: Kingpin mum on political links,"PUNE: Despite the day-long interrogation of Abdul Karim Telgi, prime accused in the Rs 2,200-crore fake stamp paper scam, the investigating officials said they have been unable to identify the â€œpolitical godfathersâ€� who may have been close to Telgi.

On the second day of interrogation, the police questioned Telgi on his political links, property details and business deals which led to the scam. Telgi, lodged in the Faraskhana lock-up, was questioned for the entire day in the office of deputy commissioner of police (DCP-headquarters) Vasant Koregaonkar.

Speaking to reporters, Koregaonkar said Telgi admitted that he had purchased printing machinery from the Government Security Press, Nasik, at an auction. He said the scamster also admitted to financing films using the money he earned by selling fake stamps. However, he has refused to give names of his â€œpolitical godfathersâ€� and is â€œtotally tight-lippedâ€� on the issue, the police official said. Telgi told the Pune police on Wednesday that he initially sold fake stamp papers by procuring them from a person printing them in Kolkata.

Investigating officials said Telgiâ€™s rise began after he took up a job in Dubai after quitting a job in a Mumbai hotel. The Dubai-based company, happy with Telgiâ€™s work, entrusted him with the task of selecting about 50 to 60 people from Mumbai to be employed in their firm. Telgi successfully sent 60 people using visas facilitated by the Dubai company.

Instead of going back to Dubai, Telgi started a travel company by the name of Gulf Services in early 1992, the police said. Charging hefty commissions, Telgi managed to send more than 350 people to Gulf countries using fake documents and papers to make their visas. However, he was caught in a case of forgery while making a bogus visa. The general branch of the Mumbai police lodged a case against him for the first time in this connection in 1992.

Lodged in jail, Telgi came in contact with Ram Ratan Soni, who used to sell fake stamp papers by procuring them from a printer in Kolkata. After his release from jail, Telgi joined Soni in selling fake stamp papers. Interestingly, Telgi snapped his links with Soni after realising that the latter was cheating him on the â€œcommissionâ€� earned from the proceeds. Subsequently, he got the stamp papers directly from the Kolkata printer.

Although his stamp vendor licence was cancelled in 1995 after cases against him came to light, Telgi continued selling bogus stamps by using licences of other vendors, the police said. As luck would have it, Telgi hit big time after meeting printing expert Uday Sawant in Mumbai in 1999. With the help of Sawant, Telgi started printing fake stamps on his own and developed a huge network to sell them throughout the country.

Meanwhile, Koregaonkar said judicial magistrate first class (JFMC) C.M. Bagalâ€™s court has allowed Telgiâ€™s counsel, A.S. Kulkarni, to be present during interrogation. The court has also asked the police to give Telgi insulin doses and sugar-free meals as he is a diabetic.

4,Vadodara raises voices against violence,"VADODARA: ''Voices against Violence'', the five-day art exhibition that opened at the fine arts faculty''s exhibition hall on Wednesday was no mere coincidence.

When Citizens'' Confluence, a group of individuals from different walks of life, decided to put up the artwork of nearly 147 artists on display to raise funds for victims of sectarian violence in Gujarat, they consciously chose October 2, a significant day to remind us of the dangers of intolerance.

This event is in a way an effort to glorify Mahatma Gandhi''s principle of non-violence through the language of rationality spoken in the medium called art.

Art has once again proved a handy tool for the members of Citizens'' Confluence who through the exhibition have collectively raised their voices against violence.

Works of art on the theme - situation in Gujarat, specifically violence and reflective thoughts and feelings emerging from it - were donated by artists from the city and places like Ahmedabad, Surat, Shantiniketan, Mumbai, New Delhi, Visakhapatnam and Bangalore which included paintings, drawings, printmaking, photography and digital work (all two-dimensional).

The works are thought-provoking and reflect on every artist''s deeper interpretation of violence and its repercussions on the society. The works will be on display for buyers from October 2 till October 7, between 11 am and 8 pm.

The major portion of the sale proceedings will be channelled for relief and rehabilitation of the violence affected people through an NGO Baroda Shanti Abhiyan, while 20 per cent of the proceeds will be reserved for funding long-term art-related programmes.

5,No case filed yet under new law against organised crime,"HYDERABAD: Eleven months after the state government issued a gazette notification promulgating the Andhra Pradesh Control of Organised Crime Act (Apcoca), not a single case was filed in any court under the new Act.

It is not that either the activities of organised crime syndicates have come down during the last one year or the police have not registered cases under the new law.

The current situation exists because the government has not constituted special courts to try these offences, which is mandatory under the new Act.

For example, the Kukatpally police nabbed a couple of former naxalites, including P Narsimha Reddy, and slapped charges of organised crime racket and creating law and order problems in the area. Reddy''s gang was allegedly involved in a couple of murders and attempt to murder cases in land disputes.

Likewise, the city police last year killed Hanif, a close-aide of mafia don Abu Salem, in an alleged encounter at Golconda.

The encounter established that the Mumbai mafia was spreading its tentacles in the city and in both cases Apcoca was applied. But the cases have not been tried so far.

Immediately after enacting the law, officials of the home department had sent proposals to the High Court to constitute a special court to try cases.

With the government delaying formation of special courts, police officials are wondering whether they could file fresh cases under the new Act before the promised sunset provisions apply for Apcoca in November, 2003.

According to sources, besides the city and Rangareddy districts, police in Khammam and Anantapur had also booked offenders under the Apcoca. But they had not filed any cases.

The new legislation empowers the police to intercept communication of the accused and use it as material evidence in courts. It also empowers the government to seize properties of the accused and impose heavy penalties, including death.

When contacted, principal secretary (home) Bharat Chandra said the government has sought cooperation of the High Court in constituting a special court.

The police official said the government had also sought permission of the High Court to allow existing special courts to try cases under Apcoca.

6,Panel revived for minister's comfort,"NEW DELHI: Faced with the prospect of certain death, a public sector agency with no role in the post-reforms economy is desperately trying to revive its fortunes by massaging the ego of its minister.

During the license-permit days, the Kolkata-based Joint Plant Committee (JPC) regulated the country''s steel industry. But now that there''s no regulation left to do, the Expenditure Reforms Commission had said the JPC should shut shop.

Instead of taking measures to wind up the body, however, an elaborate presentation was made recently by S K Bhattacharjee, chief planning manager, on the ways and means of expanding the JPC''s size and scope.

The JPC has also provided the funds for the establishment of the Biju Patnaik National Steel Institute (BPNSI) in the Puri constituency of Union steel minister B K Tripathy. At present, close to 200 people work for the JPC.

It is run from the interest it earns from its Rs 250 crore corpus. Since its accounts are not audited by the Comptroller and Auditor-General (CAG), the JPC has become the Union steel ministry''s milch cow. In fact, JPC officials have consistently resisted any CAG audit.

Tripathy is unapologetic. ""The JPC was formed under clause 17B of the Iron and Steel Order. It has been given the authority to control and maintain various funds which have no connection with the Consolidated Fund of India,"" he said.

Not that there has been no effort by ministry officials to wind up the JPC. In March, steel secretary N N Khanna held a meeting to finalise the ministry''s stand on the closure of the JPC and the office of the Development Commissioner for Iron and Steel (DCI&S).

It was decided that DCI&S be closed down lock, stock and barrel. With regard to the JPC, the feeling was that since some amount of data work would be required by the ministry, its size should be pruned drastically.

But Khanna''s attempts were overruled by Tripathy who reiterated that instead of pruning the JPC, it would be ""restructured and reorganised"". The JPC, Tripathy said, is ""the most trustworthy databank on iron and steel items"" and has taken the lead in market development.

Bhattacharjee, on the other hand, gave a new twist to the issue of JPC closure. He gave The Times of India a note of the JPC after the ERC recommendation came which goes so far as to say that ""the JPC is not a constituent of the steel ministry"".

So brazen has been Tripathy in protecting the JPC that he did not even seek cabinet approval while setting up the JPC-funded institute at Puri.

Sources point out that there was no need for setting up the BPNSI since a similar training institute, the National Institute of Secondary Steel Technology (NISST), run by the steel ministry exists in Punjab. However, Tripathy justifies his decision to bypass the cabinet.

""BPNSI will have a different character from NISST. We have not solicited any support for setting up of BPNSI from the Consolidated Fund; so the approval is not necessary,"" he explains.

7,US panel worried over religious violence,"WASHINGTON: Taking serious note of communal strife in Gujarat, a US government advisory panel has suggested to the State Department for the first time to designate India as a country of ""particular concern"", claiming that New Delhi has tolerated ""severe"" violence against religious minorities.

Others recommended to be designated as ""countries of particular concern"" by the US Commission on International Religious Freedom under the International Religious Freedom Act (IRFA) of 1998 in its latest report are Pakistan, Vietnam, Myanmar, China, Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, North Korea, Laos, Sudan and Turkmenistan.

Under the Act, countries found violating religious freedom can be considered by US President for diplomatic or economic sanctions.

In Delhi, an External Affairs Ministry spokesperson sought to downplay the recommendation, saying reports of this nature were not expected to influence the positive trend of Indo-US relations.

""The US government fully understands the strength and resilience of India''d dynamic democracy and the manner in which we have safeguarded our secularism and respect for religious diversity and religious freedom,"" the spokesperson said.

8,Pak has increased infiltration: BSF,"SRINAGAR: After a brief lull, Pakistan has again increased attempts to push militants into Jammu and Kashmir and a spurt in infiltration bids has been witnessed over the past few months, belying Islamabad''s claims to the contrary, the BSF said here on Thursday.

""There has been an increase in infiltration attempts, particularly since July this year,"" BSF Inspector General G S Gill told a group of reporters here.

Substantiating his assertion, Gill said indication in this regard were the 41 encounters witnessed on the Line of Control (LoC) since July 19 in which 90 infiltrating militants had been gunned down.

These attempts were aimed at sabotaging the ongoing assembly elections, he said, adding the security forces had anticipated spurt in the infiltration after a brief lull.

There was a phase when infiltration declined temporarily, he said, adding, ""but since the May-end statement of Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf, we had been anticipating an increase as we believed that the enemy was reconsolidating"".

Expressing satisfaction over the conduct of three phases of elections, he, however, regretted the loss of lives of 12 BSF personnel in two militant attacks in south Kashmir within 24 hours after third phase of polling ended on October 1.

""We were fearing improvised explosive device (IED) attacks in south Kashmir and we had taken precautions. But the incident in Tral when five BSF men were killed was caused by a huge IED"", he said.

Pointing out that Tral area of Pulwama district was badly affected by militancy, Gill said the heights and topography suited militants'' designs.

9,Selection of panorama's jury political: Film makers,"NEW DELHI: Serious questions on selection of jury and films for the Indian panorama and national awards were raised on Thursday by eminent film makers who alleged political pressures often play a role in it.Directors, critics and producers present on Thursday at a discussion on the Indian panorama as a role model for Indian cinema at the International Film Festival of India, were united in their opinion that the governmental promotion of films is pretty inadequate.Terming the selection process of the jury for panorama and national awards as ""dubious"", national award winning director Girish Kasarvalli said ""while 90 per cent of them, may be cinema-literate, the rest are there for political reasons"".Earlier, the director of National Film Development Corporation used to select the jury, but now, it is being done by the ministry, he said.While award-winning director Ashoke Viswanathan was for including more films in the Indian panorama, Kasarvalli preferred quality over quantity.Kasarvalli also mentioned the regional ""pressures"" which at one instance led to over 31 films being taken, as so-and-so pushed films from his language and others did the same. K T N Shastri, famous film critic and director, said the government has ""failed"" in taking the panorama films to the mass audiences, and"" there is always a nexus of exhibitors who insist on star value and will see to it that panorama films are not shown to people"".We have failed in taking the panorama films to the larger audiences, he said. There is not much participation from government in promoting panorama films among the masses, he said. Maintaining that post-Independence cinema is less Indian in ethos, Dilip K Sarcar of New Theatre group said the panorama cinema is a window of India for the world.All the speakers agreed that the panorama has helped many young and often not-that-rich film makers in getting their films noticed.Viswanathan was against terming such as panorama and mainstream and said films like Lagaan, which also have entertainment value, could be included in the panorama if they represented the Indian plural society.Jury member and film maker Rajiv Nath said the dictum the more native, the more international should apply in selection of panorama films. Panorama reflects the soil of India. It is a window to India for foreign film makers, and it should stay, she said.",NEW DELHI
10,Confessions of ISI agent leads to 27 arrests,"JALPAIGURI: ISI agent Nazrul, who was arrested from Jaisalmer along with an Armyman early last month, had revealed the names of the persons who helped him procure sensitive documents and so far 27 persons had been arrested in this connection, police sources said here on Thursday.

11,Haryana farmers find herbal remedy for cotton virus,"HISAR: Efforts of a handful of farmers in Haryana have paid off. They have found an indigenous herbal remedy for a serious viral disease afflicting their cotton crop. The leaf curl virus, popularly known as CCLV, will no longer give the farmers sleepless nights.

Coordinator of Natural Farming Network, Dr Sudhir Kaura told Times News Network on Thursday that under the supervision of Vishwa Bharati Kisan Jagriti Shikshan Sansthan, Ladwa (Hisar district), a farmers'' institute promoting organic farming in Haryana and neighbouring states for over a decade, Jagdish Kumar of Badopal village in Fatehabad district saved six acres of American cotton crop from CCLV.

According to Heera Lal, Jagdish''s associate, within seven days of first spraying of the indigenous herbal concoction, the symptoms of the disease disappeared.

According to Dr Kaura, agricultural scientists had so far not been able to find a cure for the disease caused by the Gemini virus.

The only solution, according to the agricultural university, is to uproot the afflicted plant and burn it to save the others from contracting the disease.

13,Spare a thought for farm animals and go veg,"BANGALORE: Laying hens are crammed with seven birds in a cage the size of a folded newspaper. Veal calves are torn from their mothers at birth and chained by the neck in tiny wooden crates. Breeding sows give birth and nurse their young without respite in small metal cages.

This is the tragedy farm animals face every day.

Dozens of animal lovers observed World Farm Animals Day in Bangalore on Wednesday and campaigned for veganism and vegetarianism. The vegan community (those who shun all animal products from their diet and lifestyle) are the strongest supporters of the campaign.

Their argument is that worldwide, 840 million people suffer from chronic hunger and 24,000 people die from starvation everyday. By switching to a plant-based diet, enough grains and legumes would be freed to save these lives.

An integral part of the campaign, organised by Krupa Loving Animals and Animal Rights Fund, was to celebrate Gandhi Jayanthi by lending Gandhian principles to their cause.

``Gandhi believed that every nation could be judged by the way it treats its animals. Farming of all animals is inhuman and only causes suffering of innocent creatures. They are bred only to die a painful death so humans can enjoy,'''' vegans said.

The campaign portrayed cruelty against farm animals not just as an animal rights issue but as a human rights issue as well. True-life posters of the killing of farm animals (cows, pigs, chickens, lamb, sheep) in India, taken by Krupa, and posters with facts about vegetarianism were used as banners as the group walked its way across Bangalore''s streets, shouting slogans and explaining their cause to curious onlookers.

A street dog adoption programme was organised to find the strays a home. And the response was encouraging. ``People are not aware of the cruel facts of farm animals. When they looked at the posters, many were disgusted, even shocked. We hope this is a beginning,'''' activists said.
