0,BKU-Cong clash: 76 farmers booked,"MOGA: A day after the clash between Bharatiya Kisan Union (Ekta) activists and Congress workers at Meeniyan village which left 24 people injured, the situation in Moga remains tense with the police registering criminal cases (attempt of murder, assaulting and possessing illegal fire weapons) against 76 farmers and conducting raids at their houses on Sunday.

The farmers, who had given a call for traffic bandh at various places in Punjab and gheraeo of Badhni Kalan police station, failed to assemble in Moga due to the heavy police presence.

They were, however, successful in blocking vehicular traffic at Bathinda-Barnala road in Rampura Phul town for about two hours. A large number of policemen were also deployed at the Moga Civil Hospital where six of the injured farmers are admitted.

The police in the FIR have named only 26 farmers which include Moga district BKU (Ekta) chief Tirlok Singh and Nihal Singh Wala block president of the organisation Mohinder Singh.

Most of the farmers booked are above 50 years in age.

Giving a clean chit to the Congress workers and police in the incident, Moga SSP Mukhwinder Singh Chhina claimed that the farmers used fire weapons, swords and stones to attack the former.

However, BKU state president Joginder Singh Ugrah alleged that the SSP had implicated the union leaders and farmers at the instance of Congress leaders and to settle personal scores.

He alleged that earlier Chhina (the then Bathinda SP) was instrumental in firing on farmers during the Jethu Ke incident in Bathinda which led to the death of two farmers in 2000.

Questioning why no youth Congress leader was booked, Ugrah said that some of the farmers against whom cases had been registered were admitted in the hospital with serious injuries.

The police have registered cases under Section 307, 353, 332, 323, 186, 148, 149 of the IPC and 25, 54, 59 of the Arms Act at Badhni Kalan police station in Moga.

1,Security beefed up for LS polls today,"PATNA: Seventeen parliamentary constituencies in the state are going to polls on Monday in the second phase of Lok Sabha elections amidst heightened security.

Security measures have been beefed up in view of the apprehension of large-scale violence in bordering constituencies like Siwan, Chhapra, Maharajganj, Gopalganj, Bettiah, Motihari and Bagaha. Altogether 90,000 armed forces would be on the poll duty during the second phase of polling on April 26.

According to official sources, more than 80 per cent polling booths in all the 17 Lok Sabha constituencies would be covered by armed forces. At least 100 companies of central para military forces (CPMF) would be deputed in all the sensitive booths of the 17 constituencies.

Home commissioner B K Haldar said that the Nepal border and Bihar-UP border have been sealed as precautionary measures.

The district border would also be sealed on Monday in view of the infiltration of booth grabbers.

Besides the deployment of CPMF at sensitive booths in the constituencies, a large number of Bihar Military Police (BMP), District Armed Police (DAP), Special Task Force (STF) and homeguards would also be on the job during polling.

DAP and BMP (Bihar Military Police) forces have been entrusted to undertake intensive checking of suspected people on roads in their area of jurisdiction.

The patrolling magistrates have been asked to cover each booth in their region. The magistrates will also ensure the proper functioning of electronic voting machines (EVMs) during polls.

Special vigil has been maintained in the Naxalite-affected region, particularly in Bagaha and East Champaran. Two ultra left organisations â€” Maoist Communist Centre of India (MCCI) and Peoples'' War â€” have given call for poll boycott.

These two outfits have strong base in these regions.

Meanwhile, Riyazuddin alias Pahalwan, a close associate of Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) nominee from Siwan Mohd Shahabuddin, was killed in a gangwar in Nandmura village of Siwan district on Sunday night.

According to sources, Riyazuddin was killed in an exchange of fire with members of a gang led by another history-sheeter, Ajay Singh, in Nandmura village under Siswan police station of the district on Sunday night.

Riyazuddin, a resident of Pratappur village, was wanted in connection with the killing of JNU student union president Chandrasekhar along with several other criminal cases.

2,"Copters, strike forces on the ready for polls","HYDERABAD: The state police have made extensive arrangements for the second phase of polling in 10 districts of coastal Andhra and faction-affected Rayalaseema apart from the Vijayawada commissionerate on Monday.

Director-general of police S R Sukumura said on Sunday that armed policemen would be stationed at all polling booths. These would be supported by 3,168 mobile parties, each covering clusters of 4-5 villages.

Apart from these, 776 strike force teams and 267 special strike force teams have been deployed to mount quick response operations.

The most policed vote ever in the state will be overseen by 47,576 personnel manning 26,435 polling booths in the second phase.

The 153 companies of paramilitary forces which policed the first phase of the polling on April 20 have been redeployed to secondphase districts.

Their task will be more or less the same, but with a different accent here and there. Several of the districts going to the polls on Monday have a naxalite presence but not as serious as in Telangana.

On the other hand, the Rayalaseema districts are prone to faction feuds. Nearly 2,349 villages going to vote on Monday have been identified as sensitive, 1,796 as hypersensitive, and 650 as extremist affected. Fifty-six are remote villages.

A strong communications network has been established to keep officers connected to the sub-division, district and state headquarters.

Eight IAF helicopters will be used again on Monday in naxalite-affected areas for transporting materiel and personnel.

Sukumara said 441 checkposts have been set up at key points and on the borders with first-phase districts to prevent movement of troublemakers.

He said Warangal SP Nalin Prabhat had been moved to Kadapa to assist the local machinery.

3,"CBI busts stamp paper racket, four arrested","KOLKATA: CBI, on Saturday, busted one of the biggest inter-state fake stamp paper rackets in Kolkata and arrested four persons.

Fake non-judicial stamp papers worth Rs 25 lakh and fake Kishan Vikas Patras worth Rs 7 lakh were seized.

Among those arrested is one Montu Sharma, a resident of Bihar. It has been learnt after interrogating the arrested that the fake stamp papers were bought from Bihar.

CBI is raiding several places in Bihar to arrest the others involved. Montu''s wife too is under CBI scanner. Montu had married Dolly of Murshidabad six months ago.

A CBI officer said Montu used to recruit several agents"" â€” mostly unemployed youths â€” who targeted courts and post offices.

CBI sleuths arrested an agent Bimal Agarwal from the BBD Bag area. Bimal, who named Deepak Chowdhury and Pappu Shaw as the others involved, works for a share broking company in BBD Bag earning Rs 2,000 a month.

CBI officers set up a trap by asking Bimal to fix up an appointment with Pappu and Deepak and netted the two.

Fake non-judicial stamp papers worth Rs 6.5 lakh were seized from them. Pappu too is from Bihar and he was staying at Baranagar in the city. Deepak, who works at Posta Rolling Mill and earns Rs 1,800 a month, is from Salkia in Howrah.

During interrogation the trio named Montu. CBI officers trapped Montu from Baranagar when he came to deliver fresh non-judicial stamp papers worth Rs 18 lakh to Pappu.

Court fee stamps worth Rs 50,000 and 103 blank bank drafts of Punjab National Bank, Bank of Baroda and United Bank of India were seized from him along with the non-judicial stamp papers.

""Montu appears to be a small fry in this chain. Those who supplied the fake stamp papers may be linked with Telgi''s nationwide racket,"" said a CBI officer. CBI (Economic Offence Wing) SP Amit Garg, however, refused to comment on the matter.

CBI has been inquiring into a similar case â€” following a Supreme Court directive â€” based on a complaint filed with Rajarhat Police on June 6, 2002 after non-judicial stamps worth Rs 20 lakh were seized.

The four have been charged under Section 120-B (criminal conspiracy), Sections 255, 258, 259 (possessing, selling and distributing fake government stamp), 420 (cheating) and Section 511 (attempt to cheat). They were produced before the chief metropolitan magistrate''s court on Sunday.

4,'LDA development work claim an eyewash',"LUCKNOW: Lucknow Development Authority (LDA) is heading for yet another controversy. Lack of development and basic infrastructure have irked the residents of Vibhav Khand 3-4, who complain that LDA officials are indulging in eyewash.

After the pathetic condition of Vibhav Khand-1 was highlighted in this newspaper and executive engineer BP Misra claimed that 99 per cent of the work for laying sewer lines at Vibhav Khand was complete and water lines too were in running condition. But Vibhav Khand 3-4 residents said the claim was false.

While residents of Vibhav Khand-1 await action as the budget has not been approved because of the election, the residents of house numbers 54, 55 and 56 have specifically complained that despite several reminders there had been no action to provide street-lighting in the area.

The residents of house numbers 27, 45, 50, 55, 71, 86, 88 and 111 in Khand-3 and 47, 201, 212, 216, 417 in Khand-4, said that ""the work of laying sewer lines is still incomplete and the residents have to depend on septic tanks for water disposal."" Also, they allege: ""The claim made by Er BP Misra regarding sewer line is not true.""

Residents further mention that they have to live on water from private hand pumps, even as most of the hand pumps have gone dry in the scorching heat and they are ""facing an acute scarcity of water"".

The irony is that there is a giant overhead water tank located in Vibhav Khand-3, which is today used only as a landmark, they fume, adding that the proper network of service water line which LDA had laid several years back was inoperational. ""LDA officials are in no mood to listen to grievances of Vibhav Khand 3-4 residents,"" the harried residents said.

They point out that they had already paid development charges along with water and sewerage charges in 2002, ""but are given step-motherly treatment by LDA top brass"".

Moreover, they added: ""Our area is without a proper metalled road and streetlights.""

Despite repeated complaints to LDA, no action was taken, they allege, adding ""we live in total darkness and activities of anti-social elements are on the rise.""

Ex-En BP Misra was not available for comments. Will LDA vice-chairman Manoj Singh take cognizance?

5,CCB depositors to boycott polls,"LUCKNOW: City Cooperative Bank (CCB) depositors have decided to boycott the Lok Sabha elections if the prime minister or the chief minister fails to announce concrete proposals for the revival of the bank within three days.

The CCB depositors have also been supported by large number of Century Consultants Limited investors.

The decision was taken in the CCB depositors forum meeting on Sunday. Earlier the depositors had decided that they would cast their vote in the favour of the party which would ensure revival of the CCB. However, when they did not get any favourable response from any of the political party, the depositors decided to boycott polls.

There are 17,000 CCB depositors. The strength swells up to over 80,000 if one considers the families of the these depositors. CCB depositors forum general secretary JN Sharma said that neither depositors, nor their family members will vote in these elections. ""We will vote only if PM or CM provides us with a concrete assurance about the revival of the bank,"" he says.

Sharma said that there would be no restriction of the election model of conduct to make any announce for CCB revival because Prime Minister had already given assurance twice in the past for the same. In fact, the Prime Minister''s office had also written to the state government to prepare a revival package on the lines of the Madhavpura Cooperative Bank Limited of Gujarat. However, state government has so far not been able to deliver goods even after three years.

Depositors expressed their anger in the meeting on Sunday over the insensitiveness shown by the political parties and their leaders towards the plight of the depositors. ""We had written to the Samajwadi Party candidate from Lucknow Madhu Gupta to consider our demands, however, she has not responded as yet,"" they said.

Many investors of the Century Consultants Limited are also depositors in the CCB. They were also present in the meeting and offered their wholehearted support to boycott the elections.

It was also decided in the meeting that depositors and investors will issue an appeal to the people of the city to come out in their support and teach politicians a lessons, who make only false promises.

The CCB is in crisis since March 2001 after the multi-crore century consultant limited scam.

6,Maval farmers plan stir for compensation,"PUNE: Seventy-two-year-old Shriram Begde has lost all faith in the political system and, therefore, is not likely to vote on April 26.

Just like over 400 other farmer-families in the Maval taluka of the Khed Lok Sabha constituency, Shriram lost land to a prestigious defence project in the Ghorwadi-Shelarwadi-Begdewadi belt three years ago.

All of them still await proper compensation and their elected representatives seem to have done precious little in this regard.

""All they do is sweet talk and no work,"" says an angry Begde, who lost land at Shelarwadi.

Another farmer, Pandurang Shelar, who too has lost considerable land, is all the more furious because Ashok Mohol, local parliamentarian and NCP candidate for Monday''s election, has not visited the area even once during his five-year term.

No wonder, for the affected farmers of this traditional Cong-NCP bastion, the April 26 election means precious little. Although they are yet to announce a poll boycott, the campaign has been totally low-key.

At the heart of the discontent are 160 hectares of lush agricultural land, which the district administration vacated following a defence ministry order to facilitate the construction of a Defence Research and Development Organisation complex.

Villager Maruti Begde of Ghorwadi, who lost eight hectares of land, is yet to receive compensation.

""We have been running from pillar to post. But even our elected leaders have shown little interest,"" he said, adding that those who vote now, will vote under protest.

""In fact, some villagers are yet to receive compensation for land acquired previously for ordnance factories,"" said Maruti, adding, ""Local youths or farmers whose plots were taken away, have no jobs as promised by the sitting MP and the legislators.""

""The district administration, which has been asked to sort out the matter, has done nothing notable so far,"" said Laxman Bahirat of Bopodi, who has lost six acres of land. ""Defence authorities have already started sealing off the area.""

Confirming this, sources at the divisional commissioner''s office admitted that a final settlement on the land acquisition issue was pending.

Ashok Mohol, MP, while admitting that the villagers were disappointed, expressed confidence that they would not boycott the poll.

""The upcoming project is very important from the national perspective, and we will ensure that all the affected people are properly compensated,"" he added.

A close aide of local BJP MLA Digambar Begde admitted that the local residents had been posing tough questions to all candidates over the issue.

""They will no longer be pacified by promises,"" he said. The farmers, a majority of whom depend on agricultural income, have resolved to fight their own battle now.

7,No pre-polls holiday for India Inc,"NEW DELHI: There appear to be no pre-election jitters for India Inc, which is hard at work disproving the dictum that business slows down as elections heat up. From overseas investors to MNCs to domestic firms, business is rocking the vote.

An ongoing study by India Brand Equity Foundation (IBEF) says there''s a significant rise in the number of investment decisions announced by companies and FIIs during January-April 2004 when compared to the previous two elections.

Over two dozen investment plans were announced in this period. ""Business is oblivious to elections. There''s tremendous activity, and that shows maturity of the market,"" says Rangnath Salgame, top man at Cisco, which says it has struck big-ticket deals in the past month.

Industry experts feel that a wide consensus on economic issues among political parties has allowed industry focus on doing what it does best rather than influence political parties. ""There is greater transparency now than ever before,"" says Amit Mitra of Ficci. ""There''s less uncertainty and the big picture is clearer. For instance, firms have a clear idea of where excise and import duties are heading.""

Adds Ajay Khanna of IBEF, ""Earlier, you couldn''t imagine Calpers saying India was on its map just before the elections.""

Other biggies made strategic announcements in last three months. Goldman Sachs will set up a back office centre in Bangalore and employ 250 people by end of this year. Cisco launched its optical compliance lab. Moser Baer plans to set up an optical disc unit in Germany. Philips will open HomeLabs in India to test technologies. AMD announced an engineering design centre for Bangalore.

VC and private equity firms pumped over $269 million into 11 Indian firms in January-March 2004. The amount invested is 10 times higher than the same period last year, according to TSJ Media, which tracks VCs and M&As. ""We have learnt to manage economy better. There is also convergence among political forces that good economics make good politics,"" says N Srinivasan, DG-designate at CII.

There is also no slowdown in acquisitions (IBM picked up Daksh, among other M&As) and overseas business visitors.
